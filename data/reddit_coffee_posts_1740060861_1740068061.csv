Dating apps these days feel like a never-ending loop of small talk, ghosting, and disappointment\*\*.\*\*  
Nothing feels organic anymore, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîhow many of those 'good morning' texts actually go anywhere?

What if your first meetup wasn‚Äôt a boring coffee date but something that actually felt fun and real?  
A badminton match instead of awkward texting.  
A gym session where you break the ice AND a sweat.  
A paint date where creativity sparks conversation.  
A dance session where chemistry is actually tested.

Shoot some more ideas folks!!!!!

Wouldn‚Äôt that lead to a more genuine connection instead of swiping for weeks and getting nowhere?

Ever met someone through a shared hobby instead of a dating app? How did it go? Curious to hear your stories! üëá

1iu22vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1iu22vc/some_tips_for_those_of_you_attempting_an/,Some tips for those of you attempting an all-nighter,"First of all, I am not gonna tell you what short notes to follow and which oneshots to watch, jo tumhare paas hai wo follow karo. I am assuming you have a plan and you know what to do tonight. I am just here to give you tips on how to do it as I have done it a few times before and have learnt a few things overtime by so that your all-nighter won't fail (some of it is from online suggestions, some after experimenting). Again, if you think it is not necessary and you can wrap up your studies early and get decent sleep, don't read this, sleep is important and so is your health. But if you genuinely need to do it (and screwed up like me xD) and are doing for the first time, read on.

1. First of all (the tricky part), ignore people who say it is useless. It will shatter your confidence and you won't be able to go on for the rest of the night if you keep doubting this. You don't have the energy to think about all this and it will mentally drain you too. You can do this, you have made the decision. After all, it is just a night, you can sleep well after the exam. I hope you already prepared for this.

2. Drink water regularly throughout the night. It keeps your bladder busy and you will stay awake.

3. A personal suggestion: If you are listening to something (lecture/ oneshot), do it in intervals. Or if you just plan on reading, listen to something (even music) after every 1-2 hours or so for some time, like 15-30 minutes or so, then switch it off and then study. Or maybe walk around for a bit and memorize something speaking out loud. This helped me, the idea was switching between silence and little sound kept me more awake and from being bored, and I saw this suggestion online. I hope this works for you too. 

4. Do NOT overeat: You may get hungry while doing this, have small snacks, but eating too much will make you drowsy and sleepy. Take sparing amount of coffee if you are used to it, but too much will make you active at first but not for long. Small sips over a moderate period of time would do.

If you are not used to studying late at night, here's something you must know- you will probably get your first hint of drowsiness at 1-4 AM. I won't get into the details why, but in short you would normally be in your deep sleep phase during this period. Now your mind might be spitting a lot of doubts and confusion about whether to sleep or not.  You will lose motivation to continue. Convince yourself you must go on and it is only for a night. You can do this, people have done it before and you made the decision to do so. Do not worry about sleep, an all-nighter once in a while will not cause any harm. You can sleep well after the exam (if you can finish off by 3-4 AM, gg. Short naps never worked for me cuz I would not feel like getting up, so I am not gonna suggest that, so best finish your work and then sleep).

But in all seriousness, don't do this if you think it is too risky, as sleep requirements vary from person to person, I am no doctor and I can not advise on it and you will be doing this at your own risk if you face health problems + your exam may not go well if it affects you. If you do it well, it is not an issue and I have just given some tips I used so that it does, but if you are still worried, don't go for it because if it goes wrong it will mess up your exam. But if you are determined, best of luck!

Feel free to ask if you have questions, I can answer till 10.30, after that I will have to go study lol",1,1740067795.0,JEENEETards,1,1.0,False
1iu22qq,https://i.redd.it/iiopblhwibke1.jpeg,TPP GOES TO THERAPY‚Ä¶FINALLY,"Soooo many people have commented on her posts myself included that she needs to go to therapy. 

She seems to think ‚Äúshe‚Äôs fine‚Äù & ‚Äúshe‚Äôs happy‚Äù but is she? NO 

She has changed her physical appearance with boob job, Botox and dentures, and she is miserable. 

Honestly think she has a ED she eats all day but doesn‚Äôt gain any weight, she works out everyday ( supposedly maybe changes outfit several times at the gym and takes pictures to use on different days!)

If she was actually lifting weight and adding all the protein to her diet she would gain muscle she looks like a skinny straight pole! 
And here comes the Brazilian B‚Ä¶ LIFT! 

She doesn‚Äôt eat healthy, coffee, Starbucks, Alani, donuts, and neither do her kids they will probably have food aversions like she does. That‚Äôs 
sad.

They eat out almost every single day several times. Gas station, Starbucks or restaurant breakfast for her kids, donuts.

She has a shopping addiction she doesn‚Äôt buy things out of need she buys thinned she wants and goes shopping at Walmart, Target, Sam‚Äôs club everyday! 

Well now this will finally give her something else to talk about and get all the empathy & sympathy from her sheep.

1iu22jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iu22jz/please_does_anyone_know_exactly_what_could_cause/,"Please, does anyone know exactly what could cause something like this to occur? Is there a name for this kind of condition? My brain doesn't stimulate normally like everyone else and this happened overnight.","Hello, please help me identify this and what treatment that I can have because this happened out of nowhere and it's concerning to me a lot. Here my situation:


I am a grown adult male, 25 years old, 6'1 and 189 pounds.

I tried to drink a cup of coffee today and then I felt some effects of being alert for some time. After 25 minutes, the effects of being alert and cognitive improvement started to waver on and off. It later became diminished to a low point that I couldn't recognize it anymore. I later drank two cups of coffee and a red bull that was 16 ounces and I don't feel the hyper effects. I was feeling it after one cup of coffee this morning and I was feeling something. Then suddenly, I felt like the effects literally decreased randomly out of nowhere and it doesn't make sense because I haven't had coffee in years! I took the red bull and still feel nothing. This is tied to my situation of feeling diminished experiences out of nowhere. I feel like I literally woke up one morning and lost my sensations and my brain interprets everything differently now. It's likely the brain is failing to process the information about the world and what's happening around me. 

When I even try to wake up from sleep, I don't feel refreshed immediately. I feel like I haven't slept though.
I don't feel the full refreshment at all yet. That's not good.

I tried to take melatonin as well one time. My body was falling weaker and asleep and a bit drowsy quickly as usual but then the effects started to get more subtle immediately for some reason. It started to feel like my body was fighting against it in a strange way. That's not normal at all. Normally, this is the kind of thing that should work immediately because I am VERY SENSITIVE to drugs/stimulants. My mind was fighting to stay awake and that's weird. My brain was fighting to be conscious and that makes no sense. Seconds later, the effects become very subtle for no reason. That's not normal. That makes no damn sense and I want to be back to normal. 

This morning, I took some ALPHA-GPC and within three minutes, I immediately felt like I have a high boost of energy and mood and like I can conquer my day but then the effects IMMEDIATELY became subtle. This is NOT a tolerance for me at all. That's impossible. Tolerance is when you have done something over and over again and your body starts to get used to it so you need more of the same drug to get the same effect for a new person. What's happening to me is that I immediately feel like the effects become very subtle to my body and mind immediately, which makes no damn sense. Why the hell is this happening to me?

Here are my symptoms: 

- When I take a deep breath

- When I orgasm

- When I take helpful drugs(Caffeine, melatonin)

- When I am following self improvement content or something similar to personal development. 

- When I work out

- When I go to sleep and wake up, I don't feel that refreshment again. 

- When I finish watching movies, I don't feel enthusiastic like I used to anymore. 

- I can't think about improving my life and being on my personal development journey. 

-  I can't recognize when I am acting out of line or getting agitated. 

- When I watch long movies and visit long church services as well, I don't feel like I have been satisfied or learned anything. I don't feel like the event ever happened. 


- I can get angry and irritated and I can't recognize it at all. It's is a very subtle feeling.


- Blue light blockers on my technology screens will effect me but I won't recognize the damage on my eyes because it's very subtle. I used to recognize it impacting me but the effects are extremely subtle. 

Can some explain what could possibly be causing this?",1,1740067771.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt expect anything special, just a quiet moment for myself. But then I felt it.

I glanced up from my phone and saw him standing by the counter. Tall, with dark hair that was a little tousled, and a look on his face that was too hard to read. Our eyes met.

I don‚Äôt know if it was the way his gaze locked onto mine, or how everything else seemed to fade into the background, but in that instant, I felt a jolt run through me. It was like time slowed down. He didn‚Äôt look away; neither did I. We just stood there, silently taking each other in, as if the world around us didn‚Äôt exist.

I could see the curiosity in his eyes‚Äîhe was trying to figure me out, just as I was doing with him. There was no need for words. The air between us thickened with unspoken tension, and for a brief second, I was sure he felt it too. The spark, the attraction.

I broke the gaze first, quickly looking down, trying to act casual, but I could feel the heat of his stare on me. The simple power of a glance had already created a connection I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

A few moments later, he approached my table, his footsteps slow, like he was trying to savor the moment. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the coffee, or just you,‚Äù he said, his voice low and smooth, ‚Äúbut I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about you after our eyes met.‚Äù

I looked up at him, that same playful smile tugging at my lips. ‚ÄúI was thinking the same thing,‚Äù I replied, my voice soft, almost teasing.

And just like that, the first glance had turned into something more‚Äîsomething unspoken, magnetic, and charged.",1,1740067727.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

In a world where baseballs meet algorithms, Harvard's Andrew Abler is throwing an AI-driven curveball that's set to shake up the traditional game. Forget shelling out for a pricey pitching coach‚ÄîAbler's summer venture with Tread Athletics could make elite coaching as accessible as ordering coffee.

**Abler‚Äôs Double Play: Coding and Curveballs**

Starting with a pitch-perfect summer of code and baseball with the Royal Oak Leprechauns, Abler's heart is split between striking out batters and writing algorithms. With Mother as a math teacher and Father in computer systems, he was practically wired for this dual existence. Harvard‚Äôs Engaging Gen Ed 1188 didn't just satiate his AI curiosity‚Äîit ignited a dual-edged passion.

**A Home Run for Access and Affordability**

The AI created isn't just a tech novelty‚Äîit's democratizing baseball training. Aspiring pitchers now send clips to the Tread Athletics system and receive expert feedback sans the premium coaching price tag. Utilizing tools like Google‚Äôs MediaPipe, Abler's creation watches, learns, and advises, cutting costs without cutting corners.

**AI‚Äôs Grand Slam Impact**

Looking ahead, Abler sees AI‚Äôs innings in sports just starting. With data pouring in like baseball cards, AI is swinging for the fences in all sports levels. The result? An MLB where every season brings faster pitches and perhaps smarter players.

**Rounding Third‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs Your Play?**

As AI throws its hat into the coaching ring, what‚Äôs your take? Are we on the verge of an AI revolution in sports, or is tech out at the plate, trying to innovate where heart belongs? Share your inning‚Äôs insights below. ‚öæü§ñ",1,1740067550.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm eating. I love coffee and usually have 2 caffeine drinks a day and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs the culprit. The biggest producer of the odor is coming from the crotch area but not my privates. It‚Äôs the crease between my legs and crotch gets really sweaty and the smell is this so strong and musky. It‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm sorry this is TMI extreme lol.

I‚Äôve also heard that stress can cause sweat and odor. I am neurodivergent and I have a lot of anxiety especially socially. And this has been a hellish cycle. The smell is obviously just adding to the anxiety. It‚Äôs making me want to hide away forever.

I don't like going into things without a plan, so if the coffee goes well and both of us are keen on extending, I intend for us to walk around the mall, have dinner and take a stroll along a nearby river.

Should I inform her of the potential extra activities beforehand or just leave it at coffee? I'd feel bad asking her for extended walking if she shows up in heels. She might also feel safer knowing the plan if she prefers to let someone else know where her location is before our first meeting.

On the other hand, I'm wondering if spelling out all the details might come across as being too robotic/stiff, or perhaps even thinking too far ahead.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for three years now, she moved in to my apartment about two years ago, and she got a full time job about a year ago.

When she first moved in we split housework somewhat evenly, I generally did more, but I was ok with that, when she was putting in some effort it wasnt difficult to keep a tight ship, and thats what really mattered to me, I need a clean and tidy space for my mental health.

But when she started work again she began neglecting housework and errands. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed she was just getting used to a new routine and would start being more studious when she settled into it, but months passed and I started to just put up with it.

A few months ago I decided I had to talk to her about this and I brought it up in a non-confrontational way, I just said I really needed some help around the house and I felt like I was getting it. She didnt take it well at all, got kind of defensive and loud, excuses about how stressed she is, how little time she has, saying I was trying to control her like her father did her mother. I just dropped it and disengaged because I hate shouting and confrontational arguments, and havent really brought it up since.

Well my frustration has been amplified greatly as of late because, about a month ago, my mom suffered an injury that has seriously limited her mobility, and I have to take care of her through this. Doctor says its going to take up to six months before shes fully able to function on her own again, Im just thankful she can make a full recovery.

My parents are divorced and my sister is abroad studying, and we dont have any other family in our city so its up to me to visit her regularly while she recovers.

Of course I have much less time to keep my own house in order, and its put how much work I do and the toll its taking on me into perspective. Like my mom is actually disabled rn so whats my GF's excuse? She has not stepped up at all even though Ive told her how much stress and worry Im feeling right now.

I come home from work or from staying the night at my moms house and my stress level spikes because there are clothes/shoes(gf's) strewn around, dishes and cups left in the sink, crumbs all over the counter and floor, empty delivery containers on the coffee table, the food and drink I bought will be gone and not replaced. Like I could go on but it would get tedious fast, it feels as though I have a disrespectful roommate more than an equal partner.

Im spending both my days off doing housewide cleanings and errands, its double duty, wether that be at my mothers or at my own home and Ive just about hqd it. Like its really impacting my feelings of love and respect for her. I dont even enjoy when she comes in for a hug or kiss anymore, I just feel uncomfortable and kind of annoyed.

Over the past month Ive been seriously considering a break up to focus on my own wellbeing and that of my family. I would like some advice because I have never been the one to initiate a breakup, and this is my first time ever living with a partner. Is a lack of effort around the house even a valid reason for a break up?

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Here are my very trivial issues with winter

I hate the look of cold clothes, my toddler hates being marshmallowed in his winter clothes

Scraping off a car sucks with a child in your arms

Not being able to hit the beach whenever we want

Feeling stuck inside

The wind hurting my face?

Can‚Äôt go to play grounds without 5lbs of gear

I‚Äôve even been told that the lakes never warm up and even in the middle of summer it‚Äôs cold

I have to sweep/mop after every meal because we can‚Äôt eat outside 

Good cold clothes are so expensive 

I can no longer just open the back door and let the child run in an out while I drink a cup of coffee 

We can‚Äôt eat at patios for half the year 

We scored an amazing job opportunity in this tiny mountain town so going back isn‚Äôt an option. How can I get myself to like the cold?

Dating apps these days feel like a never-ending loop of small talk, ghosting, and disappointment\*\*.\*\*  
Nothing feels organic anymore, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîhow many of those 'good morning' texts actually go anywhere?

What if your first meetup wasn‚Äôt a boring coffee date but something that actually felt fun and real?  
A badminton match instead of awkward texting.  
A gym session where you break the ice AND a sweat.  
A paint date where creativity sparks conversation.  
A dance session where chemistry is actually tested.

Shoot some more ideas folks!!!!!

Wouldn‚Äôt that lead to a more genuine connection instead of swiping for weeks and getting nowhere?

I can't say I don't miss the emotional highs, but I sure as hell dont miss the lows. I've finally learned to just be somewhat comfortable without the chemical rollercoaster. It takes a while to just be ok with boring, but in the long run, that's how we can succeed. 

I still get my little fixes off coffee or working out or other things, but gambling is not one of them any more. I'm still working on the depression and guilt, but that's more of a cause than a result of this. So all in all, starting to drill down on the psyche and the big why. It's hard to do that when you're in it, but once you are removed for a while, your brain can come up for air and start to piece together the big why and heal.

I encourage you all to keep at it, and if you are currently gambling...I encourage you to stop immediately and give yourself a chance to heal. 

Lastly, don't beat yourself up or live in guilt. We are bombarded with ads every day, and capitalism itself pushes us toward risk taking.  Hell, the President is an ex casino magnate. Also psysiologically, we are susceptible to patterns of fixation that include chemical responses we get through these actions. It can happen to just about anyone given the right set of circumstances.

>There are people ‚Äì some in my own Party ‚Äì who think that if you just give Donald Trump everything he wants, he‚Äôll make an exception and spare you some of the harm. I‚Äôll ignore the moral abdication of that position for just a second to say ‚Äî almost none of those people have the experience with this President that I do. I once swallowed my pride to offer him what he values most ‚Äî public praise on the Sunday news shows ‚Äî in return for ventilators and N95 masks during the worst of the pandemic. We made a deal. And it turns out his promises were as broken as the BIPAP machines he sent us instead of ventilators. Going along to get along does not work ‚Äì just ask the Trump-fearing red state Governors who are dealing with the same cuts that we are. I won‚Äôt be fooled twice.  
  
I‚Äôve been reflecting, these past four weeks, on two important parts of my life: my work helping to build the Illinois Holocaust Museum and the two times I‚Äôve had the privilege of reciting the oath of office for Illinois Governor.

>..I do not invoke the specter of Nazis lightly. But I know the history intimately ‚Äî and have spent more time than probably anyone in this room with people who survived the Holocaust. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned ‚Äì the root that tears apart your house‚Äôs foundation begins as a seed ‚Äì a seed of distrust and hate and blame.

>The seed that grew into a dictatorship in Europe a lifetime ago didn‚Äôt arrive overnight. It started with everyday Germans mad about inflation and looking for someone to blame.

>I‚Äôm watching with a foreboding dread what is happening in our country right now. A president who watches a plane go down in the Potomac ‚Äì and suggests ‚Äî without facts or findings ‚Äî that a diversity hire is responsible for the crash. Or the Missouri Attorney General who just sued Starbucks ‚Äì arguing that consumers pay higher prices for their coffee because the baristas are too ‚Äúfemale‚Äù and ‚Äúnonwhite.‚Äù The authoritarian playbook is laid bare here: They point to a group of people who don‚Äôt look like you and tell you to blame them for your problems.

>I just have one question: What comes next? After we‚Äôve discriminated against, deported or disparaged all the immigrants and the gay and lesbian and transgender people, the developmentally disabled, the women and the minorities ‚Äì once we‚Äôve ostracized our neighbors and betrayed our friends ‚Äì After that, when the problems we started with are still there staring us in the face ‚Äì what comes next?

>All the atrocities of human history lurk in the answer to that question. And if we don‚Äôt want to repeat history ‚Äì then for God‚Äôs sake in this moment we better be strong enough to learn from it.

>...My oath is to the Constitution of our state and of our country. We don‚Äôt have kings in America ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt intend to bend the knee to one. I am not speaking up in service to my ambitions ‚Äî but in deference to my obligations.

>If you think I‚Äôm overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this:

>It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic. All I‚Äôm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.

>Those Illinois Nazis did end up holding their march in 1978 ‚Äì just not in Skokie. After all the blowback from the case, they decided to march in Chicago instead. Only twenty of them showed up. But 2000 people came to counter protest. The Chicago Tribune reported that day that the ‚Äúrally sputtered to an unspectacular end after ten minutes.‚Äù It was Illinoisans who smothered those embers before they could burn into a flame.

>Tyranny requires your fear and your silence and your compliance. Democracy requires your courage. So gather your justice and humanity, Illinois, and do not let the ‚Äútragic spirit of despair‚Äù overcome us when our country needs us the most.

Tbh the same goes for any specialty beverage like coffee.

I'm curious if anyone else has similar tastes and has any recommendations that fits this vibe. I'd imagine this would be mostly found in white, black, ripes and oolongs from what I've tasted so far

Obviously I don't expect to find anything that ONLY has these flavors (ripes will always be somewhat earthy/woody) etc. But i'd like these to be present in any tea that I buy onward, unless I'm trying something completely new.

He's 49, and after this last physical, his bloodwork has shown prediabetes and high cholesterol. This worries me.


I want to kindly approach the subject with him without him feeling like I'm policing his eating habits, or attacking him in any way. Also, I am putting it out there that my concern has zero to do with his appearance. I love him and I'm genuinely concerned. I don't want to sound like I'm nagging him all the time, and I *do* understand that he's an adult with free will and more than capable of making his own decisions. 



I cook very healthily as I also used to be prediabetic with fatty liver and morbidly obese. I cook every day and we go out or have takeout maybe twice a month. The difference is that while my meals are healthy he triples the calories by adding excessive butter, cheeses and breads. Last night I made an egg scramble with turkey, peppers and onion. He added 3 slices of toast with butter and a 3 inch slice of cheese. He effectively turned a 700 calorie meal into 1200. Another example, he will have multiple french vanilla coffees or double cream coffees per day. When I mentioned this he did switch from double double to 2 cream 1 sugar, much to his dismay and not regularly (only when he's with me.)


I try to gently approach it once in a while but it doesn't seem like it matters to him. However, his results are from today so I'm hoping those facts help it ""click"".

""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight."" He also cowrote

""So, I began researching the Southwest in the 1880s, concentrating on Arizona. To be honest, I cribbed most of my research. I subscribed to ARIZONA HIGHWAYS, a pictorial magazine with stunning shots of the landscape. Each picture would be captioned with terrific detail, telling me everything I needed to know about the rock and the bushes. The magazines were also full of articles about the Old West.
Everything was laid out ‚Äî what guns they used, what horses, even the coffee cowboys drank.""

I'm looking at getting my first 'proper' grinder and the DF54 fits my budget/requirements, however it seems a bit of a purchasing minefield!

Does anyone have experiences they can share? I'm based in the UK.

MiiCoffee is selling and I was wondering 
1. Are they reputable/order issues - I can see they can take a while to ship but otherwise ok?
2. They offer 'filter' burrs as an add-on to the espresso burrs that ship with it - for someone who's primarily going to use for filter/moka for a while, are they worth getting?
3. Other option is direct from DF64.com - does anyone know if that's a more/less secure route (or just the same given the operating model)?

I previously had a TIMEMORE Chestnut C2 grinder and was happy with it, until it broke and I decided to buy a TIMEMORE Chestnut C3S PRO.

Currently I am trying to adjust the grind size, but it seems faulty - I have tried the various grind settings from 13 - 21 clicks for a v60, but it seems to give me the same brew time even though the other parameters are the same (Weight, technique, etc.) and I cannot shorten / lengthen the brew time consistently for the recipe like with the C2.

It seemed that the grinded coffee was uneven, so I checked the insides and the burrs seem to be aligned, everything looked like it was in place and without defects, except for the dialing screw - the pins were not the same length, thought maybe it was a specific design, but the C2 dialing screw pins were the same length. I have attached pictures comparing the two, but my questions would be:

1. Can such a difference in the pins impact the grinder to grind unevenly and can be a defect?
2. Can anyone, who has the same grinder confirm if the pins in the photo are the same for your grinders? Maybe it really is an intentional design.

Thank you in advance for your time, I will continue to test and maybe contact the seller regarding this, but thought maybe I am onto something and can resolve it before emptying the coffee bag. :)

Cheers!

I wasn‚Äôt just a good person, I was someone who genuinely wanted to love and support someone I believed deserved it more than anyone I'd ever met.*

I always made an effort to help you relax massages, head scratches, even the occasional face mask. I loved those moments of peace, seeing you melt into relaxation, and knowing that even if I couldn't fix everything, I could offer you comfort.

I bought us a record player and a collection of records so we could have quiet nights together, lost in music, or even dance around the living room. It was my way of bringing something special into our world, especially after you said we weren‚Äôt doing Christmas gifts. I wanted to create something for *us.*

When you were at your lowest, I made sure there were snacks on the coffee table, drinks in the fridge, small things that I hoped would make it a little easier for you to take care of yourself. You never really said thank you, but I did it anyway because I cared.

I made my own meals most days, but when I knew you were struggling, I‚Äôd go out of my way to cook something warm and comforting, so you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it. I knew you were carrying so much already.

When you said the bed was too hot and you couldn‚Äôt sleep properly, I went out of my way to buy a clip-on fan for the windowsill and a waterproof mattress cover so you could be cooler and more comfortable. Even though I hate spiders and disliked having the window open, I compromised because your comfort mattered to me.

I sacrificed my Christmas, holding back my disappointment when you decided not to go on the trip I had looked forward to for months. I told myself to stay composed, to be understanding because I didn‚Äôt want you to feel bad. And in the end, I spent Christmas alone while you saw your friends and family.¬†

I spent months learning about depression so I could support you better. I joined forums, read articles, even got therapy myself so I could be strong enough for both of us. It was exhausting, but I did it because I loved you.

I didn‚Äôt complain when you didn‚Äôt contribute to bills in December. I didn‚Äôt say anything when you didn‚Äôt help with the high electric bill. I just swallowed it, convincing myself that your well-being mattered more. Even though I was struggling financially, I put your needs first because I thought it would help.

When you started sleeping in the living room, I worried about you being cold. So I bought heaters, even though I didn‚Äôt have the money for them. I hated you being distant, but I let you have your space because I thought that‚Äôs what you needed.

Even when you were pulling away, I stayed. Even when you disregarded me, I stayed. Even when it felt like I was disappearing into the background, I still believed in you. I saw a beautiful future with you, even through all your darkness. I sacrificed my own well-being just to make sure you felt loved.

I bought you gifts not to smother you, but because it was one of the few ways I could express love when nothing else seemed to reach you. I wrote heartfelt letters to remind you of your strengths, to bring you some light even when I needed it just as much.

Right before you broke up with me, I had put together a care package for you. A box filled with small comforts, snacks, drinks, muscle soak, a blanket, a little truck, and photos of our memories. I never got the chance to give it to you before you left. But two days after the breakup, I found the strength to drop it off anyway. That was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done. I never heard back, and I never expected to. But I had hoped, at the very least, that you‚Äôd acknowledge it.

When you received your health diagnosis I stayed and showed you as much love and understanding even when I was afraid that this would affect us somehow in the future. I wanted you to know that I would always be there through the good and bad.¬†

Not only did I do everything I possibly could for you, but I also showed up for myself every single day. I changed my hair, took more pride in my appearance, and put more energy into my workouts. I pushed myself to save more money, explored new job opportunities, and worked towards a better future. Did you ever notice? Maybe, maybe not. I decorated the home, built furniture on my own, and never once expected anything in return except for you to be healthy and happy again.¬†

There were so many moments when I pushed aside the feelings of rejection, believing you when you reassured me that we were okay. I trusted your words, only to later realize that you were likely lying to me and maybe even to yourself. Even now, I still catch myself excusing your actions because of your depression. But deep down, I know that love like mine shouldn‚Äôt have been treated the way it was.

I gave you nothing but devotion, and in return, I was left with doubt, silence, and the wreckage of everything I held onto. I don‚Äôt regret loving you. But I refuse to let myself forget just how much I gave, and how much I deserved in return.

The most recent one was just this past week and I had this friend for just a few  months. It is like dating when getting to know a new friend in that the true colours start coming out after a few months.

For context, this person (I‚Äôll call her Sheila) told me she has had mental health issues in the past and at one point, she was unable to work because of it. She does have high anxiety issues (family issues).
She recently got a boyfriend and things seemed to shift on her end with her getting cranky/irritated with me, usually unexpectedly.

She is someone who has high needs ( likely taking meds), etc. and I know she‚Äôs doing the best she can. I have kind of faded a bit from her as I felt something odd about her..we chatted last weekend and she said she has been sensing things have changed since she got a boyfriend and she was concerned about our friendship. She‚Äôs not wrong about things changing between us but not because of her boyfriend. 
The convo was awkward and I texted her to call her out about her being annoyed or irritated with me and apologized if I had upset her in anyway.
And that I‚Äôm still grieving my lost longtime friendship and that I couldn‚Äôt be there for her in the way I feels she wants me to be. 

She wrote back a few things have come up in our friendship that she‚Äôs not sure how to address (she‚Äôs ok with how often we get together, no expectations).. and maybe we could go for coffee at some point. 

I was annoyed that she isn‚Äôt taking accountability for her behaviour (something I‚Äôve noticed) and it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs not someone who can support me when I need it. 

Am I off base with being annoyed? 
In the end, I have no desire to meet up with her again so at least this didn‚Äôt drag on longer than it did. ",1,1740064867.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I received several suggestions in response, including measuring my blood sugar levels.

In the meantime, I have measured my blood sugar multiple times over several days and at different times, and it has always been within a normal range and was pretty consistent. Thank you all for your responses and helpful suggestions!

Additionally, I have looked deeper into my diet and realized that the likely reason for this improvement is that when I eat more carbs, I consume less food that contains histamine and tyramine or triggers the release of histamine in my body. I am still experimenting, but this seems to be the key factor.

Apart from coffee, I have never had food triggers, but over the past year, I seem to have developed some. I‚Äôm sharing this because it might help others who are struggling with similar issues. If anyone has experience with this, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

I am gonna try these nootropics like next week. Did anyone try these alone or together. This has been on my to do list since years I have read papers but they don't have any meaningful effect on cognition instead may cuz depresson and anxiety due to excess acetocholine while on the other hand this combo was neurotoxic instead of memantine being neuroprotective alone. But these dose were extremely high and in rats so really extrapolating data here. Also is memantine like ketamine not scientific papers I mean in experience also I love nicotine gums 2mg daily.

My past hypothesis was nmda dissociation and donepezil acetocholine boost might lead to higher learning and reduced tolerance to my current stimulant(coffee and armodafinil) uhh I quit atomextine/methylphenidate since there were anxiety inducing reducing my creativity but increased productivity (quantity/quality) trade off. Any ways leaving that aside whats ur experience with these compounds reddit past experience claim these drugs magical mania inducing but later few year later these don't work. Somehow suggesting these might work for few months which aligns with my goal. Any ways increased bdnf might also lead to somehow worse learning later idk at this point. The more I try to think I get stuck in information overload so I am gonna try now anyways if uk something about dosage and experience then it would be great. I gonna titrate at 10mg/10mg both of them expecting 100mg of stable half life which seems a lot if I get extreme dissociation then gonna reduce to half the dosage.

I don't any other much nootropics since most them were placebo, coffee on weekends and lexapro daily for depression. The next substance on my list after this is tianeptine/kratom and microdosing  psychedelics or salvia.",1,1740064205.0,Memantality,0,1.0,False

1iu0lgl,https://i.redd.it/3qjyyu7q7bke1.jpeg,A Call out to Heart of Asia Channel,"WARNING: Read at your own risk and with respect! 

Heart of Asia Channel management, this is for you. Una sa lahat, Sorry if it sounds offended to you, but this sentiment came from your viewer since your inception in 2020:

You promised us that you bring ""The best of GMA, features Asian dramas from Korea, China, Thailand and other Asian countries, as well as top-rating GMA archive programs and recently released BL series from local producers. It also simulcasts primetime shows airing on GMA Network. 

But, simula nang ni-rigodon niyo ang HOAC, nawalan ng kagandahan ang channel ninyo, 

From a full-blown Asian drama with local content from the main channel, ngayon, mas magulo pa sa family tree ang programming ninyo. Parang pinaglalaruan at ginagawang experiment ang channel na 'yan! 

Yung ATINovelas, Heart of the World, tsaka BL series pag weekends na nga lang ang sumalba sa inyo, tinanggal niyo pa. Anong pinalit niyo. Unli replay ng mga ineere niyo sa GMA, tapos irereplay pa sa GTV tapos replay ulit dito ng one to sawa. Mga taga-programming. Anong tingin niyo sa manonood, Hindi po ba kayo nauumay? Yung mga viewers niyo like me at mga nagko-comment sa Facebook page niyo, oo. Umay na po. 

At ang problema pa, Dinamihan niyo na nga yung movie blocks ninyo, may cartoons, NCAA at kung ano-anong palabas pa, ha? 

Yung sa mga movies ninyo, eh May GTV at I Heart Movies Naman na diba, may morning movie block pa sa GMA pag 9am? Tapos ang masakit pa Yung pelikula, napanood mo na nga sa main channel sa umaga, napanood mo na sa GTV sa tanghali at gabi at uulitin sa weekend, napanood mo pa sa I Heart Movies nang umaga, partida may 2nd and 3rd Rerun pa yan, tapos makalipas ng ilang araw, sa HOAC niyo ilalagay? Ano to? Wala na bang bago? 

Tapos, ang masaya pa rito may NCAA na, may home shopping na, may kung ano-anong show pa kayo na nilalagay. Mala-Pinoy Hits ang dating???

Heart of Asia Channel, sa tingin ko po, mag-isip-isip na po kayo ng bagong content at pakulo d'yan sa channel ninyo bago niyo pang maisipang i-discontinue yang channel niyo o mawalan ng audiences even advertisers ang channel. 

Nung 2020, nagagandahan pa kami sa mga offer ninyo. Napaka-promising ng channel na Yan. Me? Myself, I'm always hoping na ipalabas Yung mga magaganda at pangmalakasan ninyong mga timeless Asian Dramas Nung kalakasan ng HOA Nung 2004 onwards, yun pala. Lumala at napariwara. 

Ang dami niyong Asianovelas na pwedeng i-rerun, magarchive kayo from 2004, Yung mga kalakasan era niyo, Yung ""Attic Cat"", ""The Frog Prince"", ""Fated to Love You"", ""Coffee Prince "", ""Love Story in Harvard"", ""Lavender"", ""Carmina"", ""All About My Eve"", ""Irene"", ""A Rosy Life"", ""Fall in Love with Me"", ""You're The Best"", ""Dalja's Spring"", ""All About My Mom"", ""Carmina"", ""Let's Fight Ghost"", ""My MVP Valentine"", pati Yung QTV era niyo. 

Tapos, yung mga bago na never pang nilalabas sa GMA, baka pwedeng sa HOAC niyo ilagay para may bagong exclusive content kayo. Ang dami niyong teaser Mula 2020-2024, may mga Hindi pa kayo nilalabas sa baul. 

Tsaka mga Boy's Love series, magangkat kayo sa Thailand, sa Taiwan, sa South Korea, andaming countries, may sarili pa Tayo na exclusive lang sa online, palakasin niyo, mag-ere kayo ng local-produced BL para mapromote Naman ang gawang atin, at Yung mga Thai BL series, mga ""My School President"", ""Dangerous Romance"", ""Secret Crush on You"", ""Lovely Writer"", ang dating feel good BL na safe for family consuming, yan ipalabas niyong bago sa channel ninyo. Ang daming BL fans d'yan. Try to talk with them. 

At tsaka Heart of Asia Channel, Yung Heart of the World niyo, mag-ungkat din kayo ng mga series sa ibang bansa, Yung ""Corazon Indomable"", iere niyo. Magangkat pa kayo ng non-asiab series para mas diverse at mas maganda ang programming ninyo. 

At maalala ko lang po, nag-shutdown na ang HallyPop, diba, bat Hindi ninyo ilapag Yung mga local programming ng channel na yan para ilagay dyan sa channel ninyo, para Hindi puro pelikula na lang. Tapos maglagay kayo ng mga bumpers like Yung mga Artists' Profiles, Series background at tsaka Yung mga Local OSTs ng mga Asianovelas, pwedeng iere, gawan ng local music video. Yung mga kanta na ginagawang theme song sa mga Asian Drama ninyo, ilagay niyo para mas mapromote ang OPM. 

At tsaka, Yung mga K-Feels, Absolutely Asian tsaka Heart of the World, gawing niyong one hour Yung broadcast with same-day replay tsaka weekend marathon. Para Naman Hindi bitin. Wag niyo rin Namang putulin. Para Hindi madismaya mga audiences niyo. Kakasya ang 9 na series per weekdays and same day replay. Then sa weekend, 9 series na marathon 2 hours. Yung ATINovelas, pwede naman yan sa weekend primetime from 6-10 PM gawin niyong weekend marathon. Kahit tig isa o dalawang oras, go lang. tapos BL series sa late night. Dalawang BL titles kada sabado-linggo.

Sana making kayo, HOAC management, Kasi if you can't improve your programming in your channel, just shutdown your channel and focus on GMA and GTV. 

If you can't listen to your audiences' requests or suggestions to improve your programming, talagang walang susuporta sa channel.

Anyway it has him with Momo yaoyorozu and an original female character named Shoka he can make disks with art and imbue them with a type of power with his stockpiled energy, I'm pretty sure anyway it was a great story a few years back I believe I don't think I can post photo which sucks but anyway do any of you know the story the name atleast I'm really wanting to re read it I've tried searching up all sorts of things I remember and also on AO3 where the story is from.

But it only says Izuku is a coffee owner which pissed me off he doesn't own it he is also friends with shinso and helps him earlier in the story and they become friends.

Shoka is somewhat shady a first thinking possibly villian but nope I believe her sister is shady and needs help and tries but gets caught up in it but by UA starts she is helped and is the sister both Izuku, Momo and Shoka date each other that's all I can remember please of anyone can remember please tell me if you can I'll be so grateful

But y'all knew with new gourmands, I was going to cave and check it out. And here we are!

First off, the atomizers on the samples are good. The mist is fine and even, it is really satisfying. 

**Marshmallow Bliss**

*(Sweet Vanilla, Vanilla Absolute, Sugar, Heavy Cream Fondant with a puff of Sugar Powder in the air)*

So this is different than the other marshmallow fragrances I've tried. This doesn't quite smell edible. It has a vibe that reminds me of fancy cosmetics almost. I think it's the powdered sugar that's making me think of powder in general. This is simple, straightforward, and elevated. Good for layering or on its own. A mental picture, if you will - if Audrey Hepburn was a marshmallow. Definitely marshmallow, but fancy.

4/5, if only I were fancy marshmallow


**Lemond Blossoms**

*(Lemon Mousse Cake, Almond Meringue Cream, Orange Blossom Absolute, Creamy Musk, Sheer Amber, Cedramber)*

Ooooo this is also fancy. This smells like the cake version of a Williams Sonoma store. Does that even make sense? The lemon is fresh, sweet, and very edible. But the orange blossom is right there with it, really making this a bright and lush fleurmand. I know there are more notes in this, but the orange blossom and sweet lemon are what I primarily get. I'm not sure I would personally wear this, but if someone near me was wearing it I would 100% appreciate it. I'll experiment with it some.

3.5/5, I wish life would hand me these lemons

**Puff Delight**

*(freshly baked Cream Puffs, Sugar, sweet Vanilla Cream, Vanilla Absolute, Salted Caramel drizzle with a hint of peanut butter, Edenolide)*

I agree with another review that I saw that mentioned that this fragrance is very similar to Sorce's 2AM in Lafayette. This is milder, and the peanut butter is softer than the oak moss and coffee combo in 2AM. The peanut butter just gives an earthy saltiness to the fragrance. It's not like grabbing a spoonful of Jif (trust me, I would know, lol). I would say if you like the vibes in Sorce's fragrance but you don't like smelling like a spilled latte, try this one - it's softer. This is a sweet and slightly salty fragrance that I would say is most appropriate for fall, but is not too heavy for everyday wear. At least not for me, I smell like cookies everyday.

4/5, this is good stuff

**Dance of the Forest Nymph**

*(Fresh Raspberries, sweet Raspberry Puree, boozy Amaretto wine, Magic Sugar Crystals, Fresh Air Breeze, Vanilla, Treemoss, Amber Resin, and Woodland Forest)*

Woah, woah, woah. This is gorgeous. This is sweet and lush and happy and not usually my thing but damn. It is hard to distinguish notes, but it is a sweet fruity fragrance, with some freshness and depth. There is a little bit of tartness from the raspberry, but it's mostly sweet/jammy
 I carried the paper swatch across the living room and my five year old went, ""That smells good!"" So the sillage on this one is nice.

4.5 /5, I am now blueraspberryforestnymph, thanks


Well y'all, my final thoughts: what a fantastic new house. I cannot afford another favorite house but there is not a dud in the bunch. Good news, though, is that Briix appears to be going for a low-fomo model, as all fragrances are permanent or seasonal (unless ingredients become impossible to source). For those on a low-buy: there's no rush, which I appreciate. 

Also of note, is that **Marshmallow Bliss** is being reformulated, and both versions of the fragrance will be in the general catalog. I signed up to receive the new sample when it's ready, so I can test that one when it gets here. ^(also I lost my sample pack last week and I'm still looking for it, I've been an absent-minded professor lately)

I love thoughts and conversations! Have you tried them, or are you likely to? I'm excited for another gourmand-loving perfumery, and I love that I don't feel pressured to buy right away, because I've been trying to stick to my budget this year.",14,1740063660.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

This morning, I believe, I found a good solution. I used 6 oz. of milk to make a chocolate protein shake, then used that shake to add creamer to my coffee. It's been delicious and allowed me to enjoy my coffee and get my protein in. However, this has broken the rule of ""Finish your meal in 20-30 minutes"".

the best part is how every company thinks they‚Äôre oh-so-unique, even though they basically all copy-paste the same job descriptions. they sprinkle in random buzzwords like ‚Äúsynergy,‚Äù ‚Äúcross-functional,‚Äù and ‚Äúself-starter,‚Äù as if that‚Äôs supposed to mask the fact that they‚Äôre basically asking you to be a superhuman. oh, you need me to manage social media, write code in six different languages, take the lead on marketing campaigns, speak fluent mandarin, and possibly juggle flaming swords on the weekends? sure, no problem. i‚Äôll just consult my comprehensive background that i obviously have, since i‚Äôm, you know, totally fresh out of school.

can we talk about the ‚Äúreferences‚Äù fiasco for a second? it‚Äôs not enough to show them your resume, your cover letter, your portfolio, your social security number, and your dna sample. no, they also want references from like, five different sources, presumably including your childhood best friend, your high school gym teacher, and maybe the lady who served you mac and cheese at the cafeteria in 5th grade. we all know that references are pretty much a formality, right? because who in their right mind is going to list someone who‚Äôd actually talk crap about them? i mean, i‚Äôm not going to drop the name of that ex-boss who was constantly yelling about how i should ‚Äúfix my attitude.‚Äù references are basically ‚Äúhere are the contact details of some people i already bribed with coffee who will say i‚Äôm an amazing human being.‚Äù the system sees this and goes, ‚Äúexcellent. you must be legit.‚Äù it‚Äôs like the professional world‚Äôs biggest circle jerk. excuse the language, but come on, how else do you describe it?

then we‚Äôve got automated resume scanners, or ‚Äúthe robots,‚Äù if you will. because apparently, your future is determined by an ai that checks if you used the right keywords in your resume. you could be the most talented, hardworking person on the planet, but if you wrote ‚Äúmanaged projects‚Äù instead of ‚Äúproject management,‚Äù the robot is like, ‚Äúsorry, no match found, goodbye forever.‚Äù it‚Äôs both hilarious and depressing. i picture some giant digital shredder just devouring resumes for sport. ‚Äúooh, you didn‚Äôt mention leadership in the second paragraph? nom nom nom.‚Äù meanwhile, recruiters wonder why they can‚Äôt find ‚Äúqualified candidates,‚Äù as if maybe the perfectly qualified folks weren‚Äôt systematically weeded out by the literal system. makes total sense, right?

but let‚Äôs not forget about the interview process itself, because it‚Äôs a shining beacon of absurdity in its own right. first, you‚Äôll usually have some phone screen where they ask you the same three questions: ‚Äútell me about yourself,‚Äù ‚Äúwhy do you want to work here,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your greatest weakness?‚Äù like, can we just address how stupid that last question is? everyone‚Äôs out here lying through their teeth like, ‚Äúmy greatest weakness is that i work too hard.‚Äù oh, i‚Äôm sure you do, you precious overachiever. i‚Äôd love to be real and say something like, ‚Äúmy greatest weakness is that i literally can‚Äôt function before my fourth cup of coffee and i have zero clue how to handle conflict without binge-watching cat videos.‚Äù but that‚Äôs obviously not going to land me a job, so i‚Äôve gotta feed them the same generic nonsense: ‚Äúi‚Äôm a perfectionist.‚Äù yep, guilty as charged.

once you pass that stage (by some miracle), you‚Äôre invited to an in-person interview where you get to sit in front of a panel of very serious people who probably checked their phones the entire time. or maybe they give you an assignment that‚Äôs basically a condensed version of the actual job you‚Äôd be doing, and you complete it for free. it‚Äôs like, ‚Äúyeah, we need a 20-page marketing strategy by tomorrow, and if we like it, we might consider you for the next round.‚Äù excuse me, but that‚Äôs literally work. so i guess they‚Äôre cool with exploiting free labor, but not so cool with giving you an actual paycheck. there‚Äôs something truly poetic about that level of shamelessness.

and if you do manage to jump through all the hoops‚Äîsprinkle just the right amount of butt-kissing, show off your ability to use 17 different microsoft office tools, name-drop a few references who happen to be your besties‚Äîthen maybe, just maybe, they‚Äôll dangle a job offer in front of you. but wait, it‚Äôs not over yet! they might need to run a background check, a drug test, a credit check, a blood test, a personality test, possibly a psychic reading, and they‚Äôll definitely want to verify you didn‚Äôt murder anyone in a past life. by the time all of that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôre basically an open book. but at least you‚Äôll get an email that says, ‚Äúcongratulations, we‚Äôd like to offer you a position,‚Äù which might just pay you enough to cover your rent if you‚Äôre lucky. oh, and you might not start for another month because they ‚Äústill have to finalize a few internal processes.‚Äù sure thing, boss.

if that‚Äôs not enough, let‚Äôs also consider the phenomenon of ‚Äúghosting,‚Äù which used to be a term reserved for dating but now is apparently super common in the professional world. you can have two or three interviews with a company, and then‚Äîpoof‚Äîthey vanish. no response, no rejection email, nothing. you‚Äôre left refreshing your inbox, your spam folder, your phone messages, your carrier pigeons‚Ä¶ all for a big fat silence. i guess sending a quick ‚Äúsorry, we went with someone else‚Äù is just too time-consuming. better to leave you hanging indefinitely. it‚Äôs so considerate, right?

i also love the concept of ‚Äúculture fit,‚Äù which is basically a fancy way of saying, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre trying to find people who vibe with our carefully curated brand of corporate quirkiness.‚Äù you show up, you do well on the test, and then they decide, ‚Äúhmm, i don‚Äôt know if we see you fitting into our friday karaoke sessions.‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry, we‚Äôre a ‚Äòwork hard, play hard‚Äô environment, and you seem more like a ‚Äòwork hard, nap hard‚Äô type of person.‚Äù i genuinely can‚Äôt make this stuff up. a friend of mine once got rejected because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt laugh enough‚Äù during the interview. i kid you not. she was told, ‚Äúwe really like you, but we need someone who will bring more humor to the office.‚Äù so apparently, your comedic timing is now a prerequisite for landing a job. good luck, folks; maybe practice some stand-up routines in between reading resume tips.

oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the weird little disclaimers at the bottom of job postings: ‚Äúmust be able to lift 50 pounds,‚Äù even though you‚Äôre applying for a desk job. or ‚Äúmust be proficient in x software,‚Äù which literally no one‚Äôs ever heard of outside that company‚Äôs bubble. half the time they‚Äôre just copying and pasting from ancient job listings, so you‚Äôll see random lines like ‚Äúexperience in fax machine operations a plus.‚Äù it‚Äôs 2025 (or whatever year it is), who‚Äôs still using fax machines? but sure, i‚Äôll add ‚Äúfax mastery‚Äù to my skill set. can‚Äôt hurt, right?

the absolute pinnacle of absurdity, though, is the wage range. i mean, have you ever seen a job listing that‚Äôs basically a small novel of responsibilities‚Äîlike, you‚Äôre expected to solve global warming, manage a 20-person team, design an entire brand strategy, and occasionally make coffee runs‚Äîand at the end, they‚Äôre all, ‚Äúsalary: $15 an hour.‚Äù oh, so you want a superhero, but you‚Äôre paying them in pocket change. totally fair. or they don‚Äôt list the salary at all because ‚Äúit‚Äôs competitive,‚Äù which is code for ‚Äúwe‚Äôll pay you as little as we can get away with.‚Äù and yet we‚Äôre supposed to smile and nod like it‚Äôs a dream job. i guess it‚Äôs competitive in the sense that we‚Äôll be competing for scraps while the ceo drives a sports car.

all of this nonsense is so standardized, so baked into the hiring process, that most of us don‚Äôt even bat an eyelash anymore. we just accept it as the status quo: jump through a million hoops, pretend we‚Äôre perfect, never show weakness (unless it‚Äôs that fake ‚Äúi‚Äôm too passionate‚Äù weakness), get ghosted, maybe sign a questionable contract if we‚Äôre lucky enough to even get an offer. rinse, repeat. meanwhile, half the job listings out there are basically describing the responsibilities of multiple full-time roles rolled into one, but labeled as ‚Äúentry-level.‚Äù oh, and they might require a master‚Äôs degree. because of course they do.

it‚Äôs almost comedic how we‚Äôre all collectively playing along. companies act like they can‚Äôt find good candidates, candidates act like they‚Äôre too good for the roles that are out there, and everyone is stuck in this bizarre dance of unrealistic expectations. you‚Äôd think at some point, someone would say, ‚Äúhey, maybe we should consider that it‚Äôs kind of insane to demand three years of experience for a job that pays peanuts?‚Äù but no, the system just chugs along, munching on hopeful souls and spitting out cookie-cutter rejection emails‚Äîif we even get those. the rest of us are left to wonder if we exist in some parallel dimension where logic took a permanent vacation.

so yeah, the entire system is pretty much a giant, hot mess. we‚Äôre told from day one, ‚Äújust get your foot in the door,‚Äù but how do you even do that if every door is guarded by the wicked witch of ‚Äúmust have 3-5 years of relevant experience‚Äù? it‚Äôs like being told you need a driver‚Äôs license before you‚Äôre allowed to take driving lessons. or that you need to be a professional chef before you can learn how to cook. but apparently, that‚Äôs just the game. i guess the joke‚Äôs on us for not being born with a fully fleshed-out resume and a couple of references from the womb.

the real kicker is that we can‚Äôt really do much about it, because we kind of need a job to, you know, survive. so we swallow our pride, craft the best possible resume full of fancy verbs, send out endless applications, and pray to the job gods that someone will see us for the bright, shining talents we are‚Äîdespite not having 27 years of experience in a field that‚Äôs only existed for five. if that‚Äôs not the height of absurdity, i don‚Äôt know what is. but hey, maybe one day the system will wise up and realize that experience can‚Äôt be conjured out of nowhere. until then, we‚Äôll just keep playing the game, rolling our eyes at the ridiculous job listings, and pretending that we find all of this totally normal. a+ for effort, right?",1,1740063372.0,self,2,0.67,False

Quark era un piccolo esploratore, sempre curioso di scoprire nuovi mondi e sapori. Un giorno, decise di partire per un'avventura in Puglia, una terra famosa per i suoi panorami mozzafiato e le sue delizie culinarie.

Arrivato in un pittoresco villaggio, Quark fu subito colpito dal calore degli abitanti e dai profumi che si diffondevano nell'aria. Mentre passeggiava tra le stradine, sent√¨ un aroma irresistibile: era il profumo dei taralli pugliesi, dolci e croccanti, preparati con amore e un pizzico di caff√®.

Incuriosito, Quark si avvicin√≤ a una piccola bottega. La proprietaria, una gentile signora, lo accolse con un sorriso e gli offr√¨ un tarallo. ""Questi sono speciali,"" disse, ""fatti con ingredienti freschi e un segreto che solo noi conosciamo!""

Quark assaggi√≤ il tarallo e il suo cuore si riemp√¨ di gioia. Era un'esplosione di sapori: dolce, croccante e con un retrogusto di caff√® che lo fece sentire come se stesse danzando tra le stelle. Decise di rimanere in Puglia per un po', per imparare a fare i taralli e condividere questa delizia con i suoi amici nel mondo quantistico.

Cos√¨, Quark trascorse le sue giornate a cucinare e a esplorare, facendo amicizia con gli abitanti del villaggio e scoprendo nuovi segreti culinari. Ogni sera, si riuniva con i suoi nuovi amici per gustare i taralli dolci al caff√®, raccontando storie delle sue avventure quantistiche.

E cos√¨, il piccolo topo Quark non solo scopr√¨ un nuovo sapore, ma anche il calore dell'amicizia e la bellezza della condivisione. E visse felice, con un tarallo in una zampa e un sogno nel cuore. 

E vissero tutti felici e contenti!Once upon a time, in a distant and sparkling world, there was a quantum mouse named Quark. Quark was a little explorer, always curious to discover new worlds and flavors. One day, he decided to embark on an adventure in Puglia, a land famous for its breathtaking landscapes and culinary delights.

Upon arriving in a picturesque village, Quark was immediately struck by the warmth of the inhabitants and the aromas wafting through the air. As he wandered through the streets, he caught a whiff of an irresistible scent: it was the smell of Puglian taralli, sweet and crunchy, made with love and a hint of coffee.

Curious, Quark approached a small shop. The owner, a kind lady, welcomed him with a smile and offered him a tarallo. ""These are special,"" she said, ""made with fresh ingredients and a secret that only we know!""

Quark tasted the tarallo, and his heart filled with joy. It was an explosion of flavors: sweet, crunchy, and with a coffee aftertaste that made him feel as if he were dancing among the stars. He decided to stay in Puglia for a while to learn how to make taralli and share this delight with his friends in the quantum world.

Thus, Quark spent his days cooking and exploring, making friends with the villagers and discovering new culinary secrets. Every evening, he gathered with his new friends to enjoy the sweet coffee-flavored taralli, sharing stories of his quantum adventures.

And so, the little mouse Quark not only discovered a new flavor but also the warmth of friendship and the beauty of sharing. He lived happily, with a tarallo in one paw and a dream in his heart.

Let‚Äôs call him Sam‚Ä¶has his own cubical which is located 5 feet or less from the fridge and kitchen area.

Last Wednesday Sam came in no mask hacking up a lung and blowing his nose. Person two Kyle works very closely with Sam and well Thursday and Friday they called out sick. Come Friday night it all began and I had to call out on Monday.

The fourth person who didn‚Äôt get sick has his own kitchen and office on the other side of the warehouse and enter / exit door. Clearly a small test result but effective enough to connect the dots.

Could I raise a case to move his office setup out of the kitchen area to atleast keep some germs from where we make food coffee etc?

600 Miles and 10 Day Review of Kia Sportage 2025 PHEV X-Line Prestige

- Moved from Tesla MY 2021 AWD - 70,500 miles with standard 10% Battery Degradation thus current range is 295 Miles range

-18 Miles Only way to work 

-Charge at home $.11 per KwH - Tesla Mobile Charge (Viptoo Adatper Adapter for Tesla to J1772 EV Charger)

-Charge at work $ .10 per KwH - ChargePoint Account

-Tesla mobile charger with 45Amp plug allows for 34 mile charge in 2 hours

-Charge with 110/120 outlet appears to be about 12 hours 

-588 miles driven over 9-10 Days

-Tampa Florida- Lots of AC..near zero heat usage 

Summary

-Very comfortable ride

-I use the AC a lot when parked..this is Florida

-Lovely Green with Grey/Green seats (Head Rest and seat cover on order because of sweaty adult and teen after gym)

-Seeking cup holder insert as I always have coffee in the morning and the switchblade mechanism allows coffee to leak through to Narnia

-Seat are very comfortable 

-Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto ((I have multiple phones)  - I am perplexed why ‚Äúwireless‚Äù CarPlay and Android Auto is not available

-The wireless charging pad has a fan.  I am sure liquid will accidentally spill in so need to figure that out.

-This vehicle appears to to have HDA1, not HDA2.  I like the fact that it remains on, when you stop as well as when you change lanes.   

-The LKA does not do well around corners

-The 360 visual is very helpful 

-If the battery is fully charged, and in EV mode, highway driving depletion to about 15-20% and gas engine starts 

-I am disappointed that Regenerative braking cannot be customized by the driver. Unlike the standard hybrid the PHEV does not allow paddle shifting regenerative braking control.

-The major dislikes:

   1) Regenerative breaking should be more aggressive (the vehicle continues to roll when I lift off the break)

    2) ‚ÄúWireless‚Äù CarPlay is missing 

    3) I wish for HDA2
 
    4) The Kia digital key is missing

     5) The Kia app can be much better ..Kia please put so efforts in the Kia App
 
     6) There is a remote snapshot view of your vehicle on the app.  It should be easy for a live view, like the Tesla..again Kia..why not?


-Lots to like with the PHEV

    1 [($1.5 /day saving) * 365 Day]* 5 years = $$2,737 minimum saving 

   2 I did not have time to shop so $20K trade in for 2021 MY with 71K miles and needed tires plus alignment -> Kia 2025 Sportage X-LIne PHEV $46K out the door, no financing

   3) Comfortable ride

   4) The PHEV does not have a spare ..however the regular hybrid does have a spare 

   5) I am unsure why the Kia does not have a walkways door locking feature 


NOTE:  I really tried to like the MY Juniper..However EV charging congestion is a major negative.  In Orlando, Naples, Miami and aft Lauderdale I have had to wait in que for the chargers and it is getting worse.  Also I am concerned with demand based pricing as some locations approach $.80 and above cost per KwH fast charging:(

Then, all of a sudden, I started feeling nauseous and having diarrhea. For some reason, I took it very seriously and began thinking of the worst‚Äîsurely, I must have colorectal cancer.

I went to the doctor. Took countless medications. Had numerous tests done since then‚Äîincluding a colonoscopy, CT scan, MRI, and endoscopy.

Nothing abnormal.

However, for countless nights, I could only think of the worst. I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it. I would wake up in the morning, like a zombie, still thinking about it. And that‚Äôs how it went throughout the entire day.

Strangely, new symptoms kept appearing. For example, rib pain, hand tremors, blurry vision, and several other things.

My doctors kept insisting‚Äîand still insist: you have nothing. Absolutely nothing!

‚Ä¢¬†Is hand tremor a common symptom of anxiety, even when you‚Äôre not actively thinking about the problem? Sometimes, when having coffee in the morning, my hands just start shaking.

‚Ä¢¬†Have you ever experienced pain after hearing that a certain disease could cause it? For example, ever since I started considering the possibility of pancreatic cancer, my back started hurting.

I have been on WW for 2 months now & things were going great. I was losing consistently. Until the last month. I'm eating within my points, usually lower than my allotted points but there are a couple things I don't track (my SF coffee creamer & my FF whipped cream, which I have like 2-3x a week on hot chocolate, I DO count my hot chocolate). Neither of which are making up that many points. I even track all 0pt foods I eat.

I have double check my macros against calories & majority of days I'm eating between 1800-2000 calories a day, so a healthy calorie amount & still in a deficient. I've looked up my BMR, which states I burn on average 2700 calories per day. So I'm in a decent deficient.

But over the past month the scale is stuck. It will fluctuate up or down, but I'm playing with the same 5 pounds for a month now. I know I'm doing the right thing, but its getting frustrating watching the scale not budge at all.

I guess I'm looking for advice. What would you do? What are you doing & is it working?

I have figured out a pattern with my scale, which is why I'm giving it another week before I make a decision. But I'm definitely getting discouraged right now.

Tomato/Spinach/Shrimp pasta - 7pts (I add an addition 2pts of parmesan cheese)  
Beef stew - 2pts (lean beef, carrots, potatoes, onions)

Other things I have made:  
Chicken pad thai - 9pts  
Chicken & dumpling soup - 6pts  
Enchiladas - 5-7pts each (depends on the kind)

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1itzr6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1itzr6z/symptom_improvement_on_levo_timeline/,Symptom Improvement on Levo Timeline?,"Hi all! So I have been on levothyroxine for a week now. For some context, I was diagnosed in 2021 and worked with a holistic endocrinologist who discovered my gluten allergy and got my TPOs down from the 700s to 127 in 2022. 

Back in May I started to feel off again but put it down as anxiety and I slowly felt worse over the summer but it was extremely gradual, I felt okay as far as October but November and December is when the brain fog got pretty bad, inflammation in my upper abdomen and chest, palpitations (I also have hyperadrenergic POTS so inflammation or sickness ups my palpitations), air hunger, and fatigue. It's almost debilitating but thankfully I work from home and live with family.

I got my labs back with my TSH now at 3.94, my free T3 at 3.4 and my free T4 at 1.3 My TPOs are up slightly at 148. My cholesterol and absolute lymphocytes and blood pressure are also all elevated. I have been off gluten for three years, had almost no dairy since the middle of December, and haven't had coffee or soda for a couple weeks now.

I'm on 50 mcg of Levo and since then the brain fog seems better but I feel like I get these surges of adrenaline I'm assuming that make me super anxious. It can happen randomly just while I'm sitting or yesterday I was playing with my dog chasing him and had to stop after a minute cause I felt like I was going into a panic attack. It also worries me if this is a cardiological issue but I had my heart checked with ECG, EKG, echocardiogram, heart monitor tests, etc when I was diagnosed with POTS four years ago. I plan to see a cardiologist again just to check for anything but my last EKG in July was also clear. 

I was just curious if anyone has experienced this and if it went away or if you also have POTS if you noticed this? I plan to see an endocrinologist since my GP isn't well-versed in Hashi's but am debating eventually going back to a functional doctor if I can find a good one I can afford. Any and all advice about this would be appreciated cause I'm just tired of feeling this way!",1,1740061798.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

Cody‚Äôs grunts and Liz‚Äôs shrieks had taunted me through the walls for more than an hour; and then, in the postcoital quiet, with my cheeks wet with tears, I lay awake well into the night, telling myself that my best course of action would be to put on a smile and try to make this transition go as smoothly as possible for the sake of the family. The alternative was more household turmoil and confusion, which nobody wanted. If I acted happy in my new maid‚Äôs role, I figured, I‚Äôd be making the best of a tough situation. It was the only way to stay with Liz, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt live without her. Accepting my fate with grace was my only real choice.



While lying in bed, I‚Äôd done some research on my smartphone and learned that when former President Barack Obama was a kid, he‚Äôd had a trans nanny named Evie. I also found multiple examples of seemingly normal families where dads had transitioned. Cody had grown up around trans folks, with a transgendered servant taking care of all the household chores. 



I concluded that the idea of me becoming the family maid wasn‚Äôt all that crazy or inappropriate for the girls, and even though I sensed that my new role wouldn‚Äôt always be easy to deal with, I promised to try my best. According to Cody, the trans people he‚Äôd grown up around were happiest when they didn‚Äôt hide who they were, and I wondered: Could I possibly find contentment living openly as a trans maid? Life certainly hadn‚Äôt been so great for Walter, the unemployed milquetoast househusband; what did I really have to lose? I did all the housework, anyway, and had always taken orders from Liz and her daughters. 



One thing was certain: Refusing to go along with Cody‚Äôs scheme would cause me to lose everything. And that was a fate I didn‚Äôt want to contemplate. 



During my nocturnal ruminations, I realized that, in the sexual realm, Cody was as much into the fetish as I was. Somehow, through fate, my wife‚Äôs first husband had not only turned up alive, but it turned out he got turned on by turning the screw to sissies like me! Why else would he have made me do things like shake my ass for him, or order me to kneel and beg to suck Liz‚Äôs toes? He clearly enjoyed humiliating me, and Liz got a kick out of watching him put me through my paces.



I recalled something Cody had told me the night he moved in, after I‚Äôd mentioned to Liz that she‚Äôd never embraced my fantasy during our marriage: ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt interested in your sissy shit. But I am.‚Äù 



With all those stars aligning, and buoyed by Liz‚Äôs promise that she wasn‚Äôt out to ruin my life, I reaffirmed my vow to try to make this situation work.



I knocked on the bedroom door with my elbow, hoisting the tray I‚Äôd prepared that held two cups, a coffee carafe, and a vase with a flower. I‚Äôd even folded the napkins at 45-degree angles. 



‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù Cody called out. ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù



I took a deep breath and opened the door. The still-jarring sight of a muscular man snuggling with my former wife in my former bed made me want to cry, but I sucked it up and adopted my faux smile.



‚ÄúGood morning, Mistress. Good morning, Master,‚Äù I said in my cheeriest voice. ‚ÄúMay I bring in your coffee?‚Äù



Liz yawned with a smile. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs in a good mood.‚Äù She waved me in, and I served the piping-hot beverages to the happy couple, while telling myself, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre your bosses now. Treat them like it.‚Äù



When I set Cody‚Äôs cup on the nightstand and turned to walk away, he grabbed my pajama shirt, stopping me cold.



‚ÄúAre you going shopping today, Mirabella?‚Äù he asked, patting my ass. ‚ÄúWe really need to get you dressing like the maid around here.‚Äù



‚ÄúUm, I had planned on ordering some stuff online, if that‚Äôs okay with you, Master.‚Äù



‚ÄúOnline? That‚Äôll take a damn month!‚Äù



Liz chuckled. ‚ÄúNo, honey, it‚Äôs different now ‚Äî you can order things and get them the same day sometimes.‚Äù



‚ÄúWow, same-day delivery from the internet?‚Äù Cody shook his head. ‚ÄúAll these changes are a trip; the worldwide web has gone crazy in the past 12 years.‚Äù He took a sip of coffee and looked at me. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôll get here today or tomorrow, you can go ahead and order them ‚Äî but your mistress and me need to approve them first.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs it okay if I show you the ones I picked out on my phone, Master?‚Äù



He nodded and I pulled up the website before handing over my cellphone. Liz leaned her head on Cody‚Äôs shoulder as the couple reviewed my suggested purchases. 



‚ÄúThese are all modest,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhich is good for daily wear ‚Äî but for our alone time, we‚Äôre gonna order this one ‚Ä¶ and this one ‚Ä¶ and this one.‚Äù Each thumb swipe was accompanied by a giggle.



Cody pointed. ‚ÄúOoh, pick that one too, Bum-Bum ‚Äî he‚Äôll look hilarious!‚Äù



My wife acquiesced with a smirk and I wondered which outfits they‚Äôd chosen for me, since some of the getups on that website were pretty wild.



Liz read my mind.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you peeking at what we ordered, you hear?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, Mistress.‚Äù



‚ÄúPromise?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Mistress, I won‚Äôt look.‚Äù



Cody slurped his coffee. ‚ÄúYour cock cage should be coming in the mail; my aunt knows a guy who custom makes good ones out of graphite, and she said it should be here soon.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Master. Um, thank you, Master.‚Äù



Liz nuzzled Cody‚Äôs bicep. ‚ÄúMm, your aunt sounds so interesting. I can‚Äôt wait till she gets here.‚Äù



This was the first I‚Äôd heard that Cody‚Äôs aunt was planning to visit. I wondered when that was going to be, but stopped myself from asking, since it wouldn‚Äôt have been prudent for a maid to prod like that, and I was doing my best to assume the role fate ‚Äî and Cody ‚Äî had chosen for me.



My wife glanced at her nightstand clock and shooed me away with her fingertips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late ‚Äî go make sure the girls are up and then get started on breakfast. I‚Äôll have waffles.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Mistress.‚Äù



‚ÄúHam and eggs.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Master.‚Äù



After executing my best dress-less curtsey, I ventured down the hall toward the girls‚Äô rooms. I knocked on Brooke‚Äôs door first.



‚ÄúUm, Miss Brooke? Are you up, Miss?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù came the drowsy reply from behind the door.



‚ÄúOkay, make sure you wake up, now, your mother wants you up.‚Äù



‚ÄúI will.‚Äù



‚ÄúUm, Miss? What would you like for breakfast?‚Äù



‚ÄúBacon and eggs, thanks.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome, Miss.‚Äù



With the easy part out of the way, I tapped on the youngest sibling‚Äôs door. 



‚ÄúMiss Mia?‚Äù



No answer. I knocked louder.



Still nothing. 



‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ Miss Mia?‚Äù Three more raps didn‚Äôt rouse her, so I opened the door a crack. ‚ÄúMiss Mia? Is everything okay?‚Äù



The scowl on her face when I flicked on the light switch made me flinch.



‚ÄúTURN OFF THE LIGHT, MAID, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?‚Äù she screamed so loud it hurt my ears. ‚ÄúARE YOU FUCKING STUPID??‚Äù



From down the hall, Liz admonished her youngest daughter: ‚ÄúWatch your damn mouth, or I‚Äôll wash it out with soap.‚Äù



‚ÄúSorry, Ma.‚Äù 



Mia huffed and looked at me with pure spite. ‚ÄúMom won‚Äôt be around all the time,‚Äù she whispered. 



‚ÄúPlease, Miss Mia ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what I did to make you mad, but I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúAfter all these changes, your dad being alive, me coming out as trans, I‚Äôm trying the best I can to fit into the family in a way that‚Äôll be comfortable for everyone, and I‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre a little wuss who can‚Äôt carry my dad‚Äôs jockstrap,‚Äù Mia cut me off, keeping her voice low so her mother wouldn‚Äôt hear. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act all high and mighty, like you‚Äôre doing some big favor for the family ‚Äî you‚Äôre scared to death of my dad, that‚Äôs all. You got to do what HE says. He‚Äôd kick your butt in a minute, and you know it.‚Äù



‚ÄúLook, Miss, please, your father and me‚Äî‚Äù



‚ÄúYou mean your master?‚Äù Mia smirked.



‚ÄúPlease, Miss Mia, don‚Äôt make this any more difficult than it already is.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs my dad your master, or isn‚Äôt he? That‚Äôs what he makes you call him.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs the master of the household; you heard him say that‚Äôs how his aunt wanted things done, and that‚Äôs how he wants it here, too. So, yes, I call him ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô and your mother ‚ÄòMistress,‚Äô and you guys ‚ÄòMiss.‚Äô That‚Äôs how they do it in formal households, I guess.‚Äù



‚ÄúMm hm.‚Äù Mia chuckled. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm dumb? What a little wuss you are. You‚Äôve always been a wuss, Walt ‚Äî I mean, Mirabella. Mir-A-Bell-A! Pfft, what a stupid name. Everything about you is stupid.‚Äù



‚ÄúLook, Miss Mia, please, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, like Dad said last night, you work for me, now. He said I should consider you my employee, and that‚Äôs exactly right. You.work.for.ME.‚Äù



‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ I know, Miss Mia, and I‚Äôm very, very happy to be working for you.‚Äù I put on my bullshit smile. ‚ÄúI really am. I just hope we can have a good employer/employee relationship, and I‚Äôll do anything I can‚Äî""



‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù She waved her hand. ‚ÄúStop trying to get me to like you. That‚Äôs all you‚Äôve ever done ‚Äî act like my buddy, trying to get me to like you. Well, guess what? I don‚Äôt like you. I never did and I never will. Now, then, Maid, did you get my red blouse ready like I told you to?‚Äù



My shoulders sagged. ‚ÄúYes, Miss, it‚Äôs hanging in your closet, Miss.‚Äù



‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll have oatmeal for breakfast. With cinnamon. And toast. Now, get lost.‚Äù



I started to leave, but the astute teen stopped me.



‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt Dad say you were supposed to curtsey when someone tells you to do something?‚Äù



With my ears burning, I dipped as required.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not much of a trans dressed in those stupid pajamas.‚Äù



‚ÄúUm, I have some maid‚Äôs uniforms coming in the mail, Miss.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll look stupid in those, too. Now, go.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Miss.‚Äù I curtseyed a second time, and got the hell out of there, trying my best not to cry.



When I got to the kitchen, I literally had to shake my head to snap out of the despondent mood Mia‚Äôs rant had put me in. She was right ‚Äî I HAD always bent over backwards trying to get her to like me. I‚Äôd acted that way with both the girls, and I suppose my desperation was annoying to them, although Brooke had always been nicer about it.



As I prepared breakfast, it dawned on me that becoming the maid was the next logical step in my relationship with Brooke and Mia. They‚Äôd grown up watching their mother completely dominate me, and from the very beginning, they knew they had more authority in the household than I did. Since Cody had forced me to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù to the family, Brooke had been treating me kindlier than she ever had, although she‚Äôd always been a sweetheart, if not a bit demanding at times.



Unfortunately, the household change brought out the opposite feelings in her little sister. Mia had never liked me much, and now she outright hated me.



After the family filed downstairs and took their places at the dining room table, I didn‚Äôt have to be told not to sit down with them. I filled everyone‚Äôs plates and took up a position in the corner.



Cody noticed. ‚ÄúYou need to stand up straight, Mirabella, and fold your hands nicely in front of your lap.‚Äù 



‚ÄúYes, Master,‚Äù I said, making Mia scoff.



The breakfast conversation veered from one subject to the other. I perked up when Cody mentioned his aunt.



‚ÄúShe hates flying ‚Äî she‚Äôs taking the Amtrack, so she‚Äôll probably get here Wednesday,‚Äù he explained after Mia asked when Aunt Sheila was due to visit.



I felt a twinge of sadness because nobody had apparently thought I was important enough to be looped in on the matter.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even part of this fucking family anymore,‚Äù I muttered to myself before making a conscious effort to stop that line of thinking. Recalling my vow to ‚Äúchin up‚Äù and try to be a good maid, I maintained a stoic expression as I stood at attention near the table in the stance Cody had prescribed, listening to the conversation with my eyes lowered.



‚ÄúWhy does she hate flying?‚Äù Brooke asked. She took a drink of orange juice, glanced at me and pointed to her half-empty glass. I hopped into action, refilling Brooke‚Äôs OJ as her father answered her question.



‚ÄúShe‚Äôs kind of eccentric that way,‚Äù Cody explained. ‚ÄúAunt Sheila would literally walk into a den of lions and stare them down ‚Äî the woman has as much guts as any GI I ever served with ‚Äî but she doesn‚Äôt like flying; she says it gives her the willies. And spiders; she hates spiders.‚Äù



‚ÄúIs she bringing her trans maid?‚Äù Mia wanted to know.



‚ÄúJody?‚Äù Cody shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, Jody died years ago.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt she get another maid?‚Äù Mia asked.



‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Cody said. ‚ÄúShe very well may have gotten another maid; I didn‚Äôt ask her. But she didn‚Äôt mention bringing anyone with her.‚Äù



Cody then regaled the family with war stories, and I found myself admiring him as much as the ladies.



As Mia started to take a bite of oatmeal, she frowned at her spoon. ‚ÄúGet over here, maid,‚Äù she ordered in a nasty voice. 



I scurried over to Mia‚Äôs side of the table, and she showed me the spoonful of mush, which had a small, curly hair imbedded in it.



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this crap?‚Äù she demanded.



‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry, Miss, I didn‚Äôt see that,‚Äù I apologized. ‚ÄúCan I make you another bowl?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, stupid, you can‚Äôt make me another bowl ‚Äî I lost my appetite.‚Äù



Liz frowned at her youngest daughter. ‚ÄúWhat have I said about the way you talk to people? That‚Äôs rude; there‚Äôs no need to call him stupid.‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, he IS stupid, Ma!‚Äù Mia sighed. ‚ÄúI mean, how hard can it be to make oatmeal without getting a bunch of hair in it?‚Äù



Liz nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, I had a hair in my coffee the other day, too,‚Äù she said, clucking her tongue at me. ‚ÄúYou need to do better, Mirabella.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes, Mistress, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said with a curtsey while Mia looked at me with a smug expression, clearly pleased that her mother had taken her side over me for a change.



Cody wiped his mouth with a napkin. ‚ÄúI think we need to put a system in place ‚Äî a system of rewards and punishments for when the maid does something good, or when he screws things up like that.‚Äù



‚ÄúPunishment?‚Äù Brooke searched her father‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mean; why does he need to be punished?‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, honey, it‚Äôs not really mean because this is the way Mirabella wants it.‚Äù Cody looked at me. ‚ÄúAunt Sheila had a great system that kept the household running smoothly. And, believe me, sweetheart, trans maids need that kind of structure in their lives. It‚Äôs part of who they are. Tell her, Mirabella.‚Äù



With a curtsey, I lied like I knew Cody wanted: ‚ÄúUm, your father is right, Miss. I ‚Ä¶ I want to be the best maid I can be, so ‚Ä¶ um ‚Ä¶ sometimes, if I don‚Äôt do that, I think it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ um, it‚Äôs good that I be ‚Ä¶ er, p-punished.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Brooke‚Äôs expression showed her concern. ‚ÄúDad, what kind of punishment are you talking about?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, it could be anything,‚Äù Cody said breezily.



‚ÄúWhippings?‚Äù Mia‚Äôs eyes glowed.



‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Cody mused. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to see what kind of punishment/reward system we can come up with. Maybe Aunt Sheila can help. She‚Äôs an expert on this kind of stuff.‚Äù



‚ÄúOoh, can I whip him?‚Äù Mia asked with a scary glance my way.



‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre not whipping anybody.‚Äù Liz frowned. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs any punishment to be handed out, it‚Äôll be done by your father or me.‚Äù



Mia threw up her hands. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no fair! If he‚Äôs OUR maid, too, why can‚Äôt we punish him?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause you can‚Äôt,‚Äù Liz snapped. ‚ÄúNow, shut up about it and finish your oatmeal ‚Äî it‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not eating this, Ma ‚Äî it‚Äôs got a hair in it!‚Äù



‚ÄúWell, Mirabella offered to make you another bowl and you didn‚Äôt want one.‚Äù Liz glanced at her watch. ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs go ‚Äî you two are gonna be late for school.‚Äù



Everyone finished breakfast and Liz left the house for work, but not before giving her lover a long, passionate good-bye kiss, something she‚Äôd never once done with me. Then, Cody lumbered back to the bedroom while I went outside and warmed up the minivan. Before we took off, the girls ordered hot chocolates to go, which I put into a pair of Styrofoam cups. 



Brooke and Mia scrolled their cellphones during the ride to school and didn‚Äôt talk to me at all. After I pulled up in front of Central High, Mia waited until Brooke had exited the minivan before finally addressing me.



‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said, taking a final sip from her hot chocolate before turning the cup upside-down and dropping it in my lap. ‚ÄúTake care of that, maid.‚Äù 



‚ÄúYow!‚Äù I screamed when the hot liquid burned my legs.



Brooke peered through the minivan window with a scowl. ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you just do, Mia?‚Äù



‚ÄúNothing ‚Äî I handed him my hot chocolate, and some spilled.‚Äù



Brooke looked at me. ‚ÄúIs she lying?‚Äù



‚ÄúUm, no, Miss, it was just an accident,‚Äù I said under my breath so nobody else would hear me.



‚ÄúOkay, then.‚Äù Brooke smiled. ‚ÄúSee you after school.‚Äù



When her sister wasn‚Äôt looking, Mia shot me a smug sneer before turning and following Brooke into the school building. 



It took me a few minutes to collect myself. I was finally able to put the minivan in gear and pull away. 



As I drove back toward the house, it dawned on me that I‚Äôd be home alone with Cody all day. The prospect of what might happen made my hands tremble, and it was all I could do to keep the steering wheel straight.

She usually stays over at my place for anywhere from two to five days. 

When it comes to bedtime, she stays in my room, but I end up sleeping on the couch because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sleeping around her. She frequently farts, drools, and has a noticeable odor.  

I‚Äôve offered her the option to shower, suggesting that it might help her feel fresher and more comfortable, but she always insists that she has deep-rooted trauma related to cleanliness. While I understand and respect that, I don‚Äôt think it justifies letting things pile up...like leaving multiple coffee cups on the nightstand, or leaving her trash around my room. 

What really bothers me is her lack of basic hygiene habits, especially after the whole pandemic, you would think people learned from it. She often plays with her septum piercing to wipe away snot with her bare hands, then uses those same hands to grab snacks from a shared bag or plate. She also coughs without covering her mouth, despite me explicitly telling her that it makes me uncomfortable. She can go days without showering or brushing her teeth, which is a stark contrast to me, as I take hygiene very seriously. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised we‚Äôve remained friends despite our differences in this area.  

I want to confront her about this, but I don‚Äôt know how to do it without completely hurting her feelings. I‚Äôm really tired of cleaning up after her and constantly feeling like I would get sick just being around her. How can I bring this up in a way that‚Äôs honest but not too harsh?

I have a spending problem, my husband does not. I go to Tim Hortons in the morning (I bought a Keurig for work so I'm going to start making coffee/tea when I get in) I also eat out a lot (dealing with that with a nutritionist/therapy).

Anyway, I have around $10k in credit card debt and $18,399 left of a car loan at 2.99%. I have a GIC that is about to hit maturity in April and I'm not sure if I should use it to pay off most of the debt or if I should keep it for a house downpayment. We do want to buy a house in the future but do not have a set timeline. The GIC will have just shy of $20,700 when the term is finished.

Breakfast is often touted as the most important meal of the day, and when you‚Äôre on a mission to shed some pounds, this couldn‚Äôt be more true. For many of us with busy schedules, mornings can be a rush of alarms, coffee, and frantic attempts to get out the door. But what if you could transform your breakfast routine into a powerhouse of nutrition that not only fuels your day but also supports your [weight loss goals](https://igli.me/weightlformula)? In this article, we‚Äôre diving into a collection of quick, healthy, and delicious breakfast ideas that are perfect for weight loss‚Äîand they‚Äôre so simple you can prepare them in minutes!

Whether you‚Äôre a smoothie lover, an overnight oats enthusiast, or a fan of protein-packed egg dishes, there‚Äôs something here for everyone. We‚Äôll walk you through why breakfast matters for weight loss, share creative recipes that are as tasty as they are nutritious, and provide practical tips for meal prep and planning. Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîno one wants to feel deprived or rushed in the morning, so these ideas are designed to be light on calories yet heavy on flavor and satisfaction.

**Why Breakfast Matters for Weight Loss**

Starting your day with a well-balanced breakfast is key to regulating your metabolism and controlling hunger throughout the day. When you skip or rush through breakfast, you might end up reaching for high-sugar snacks later on, which can sabotage your weight loss efforts. A nutritious breakfast packed with protein, fiber, and healthy fats not only provides long-lasting energy but also keeps you full and focused until lunch.

Research suggests that people who eat a balanced breakfast are more likely to make healthier food choices later in the day. A slow and steady start helps stabilize blood sugar levels and prevents the dreaded mid-morning energy crash. Plus, taking the time to enjoy a nutritious meal sets a positive tone for the rest of the day and can even boost your mood. It‚Äôs not just about calories‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a sustainable eating pattern that supports your overall well-being.

**Quick Breakfast Ideas to Kickstart Your Weight Loss Journey**

When you‚Äôre aiming for weight loss, every meal counts. Below are some breakfast ideas that are both quick to make and light on calories, ensuring you stay on track without sacrificing taste.

**1. Energizing Smoothies**

Smoothies are a fantastic option for those on the go. They‚Äôre quick to blend, customizable, and can pack a nutritional punch. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* **Green Power Smoothie:** Blend together a handful of spinach, half a frozen banana, a scoop of protein powder, a tablespoon of chia seeds, and unsweetened almond milk. This smoothie is rich in vitamins, fiber, and protein.
* **Berry Blast Smoothie:** Combine mixed berries, a dollop of low-fat Greek yogurt, a splash of water or unsweetened almond milk, and a teaspoon of flaxseeds. The antioxidants in berries are great for fighting inflammation, while the protein helps keep you full.
* **Tropical Twist:** Blend pineapple, mango, a small piece of ginger, and coconut water. For an extra protein boost, add a scoop of pea protein powder.

Smoothies are an excellent way to get your fruits and veggies in without even thinking about it. They‚Äôre especially handy if you‚Äôre often on the move or prefer a meal you can take with you.

**2. Overnight Oats ‚Äì Ready When You Are**

If you‚Äôre a fan of make-ahead breakfasts, overnight oats are a game changer. They require minimal morning effort yet provide a warm, hearty start to your day. Here‚Äôs a basic recipe:

* **Classic Overnight Oats:** In a mason jar, mix ¬Ω cup of rolled oats with ¬Ω cup of unsweetened almond milk (or your milk of choice), a tablespoon of chia seeds, and a dash of cinnamon. Stir well, seal the jar, and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, top with fresh berries, a sprinkle of nuts, or a drizzle of honey for sweetness.
* **Peanut Butter Banana Oats:** Add slices of banana and a tablespoon of natural peanut butter to your base. This combination not only tastes like a treat but also gives you a good mix of protein and healthy fats to keep hunger at bay.
* **Cranberry Almond Oats:** Stir in a handful of dried cranberries and a few chopped almonds. Cranberries add a tart burst of flavor while almonds contribute a satisfying crunch.

Overnight oats are versatile, and you can adjust the ingredients to match your taste. Plus, they are a fantastic source of fiber, which is essential for a filling breakfast that keeps you energized throughout the day.

**3. Savory Egg Dishes**

Eggs are a breakfast staple for a reason‚Äîthey‚Äôre packed with high-quality protein and a host of essential nutrients. Here are a couple of quick egg-based recipes:

* **Veggie-Packed Egg Scramble:** Saut√© a mix of your favorite vegetables (spinach, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes work great) in a nonstick pan. Whisk together two eggs (or egg whites if you‚Äôre cutting back on calories) and pour over the veggies. Stir until cooked through, and finish with a sprinkle of fresh herbs like basil or parsley.
* **Egg White Omelette with Avocado:** For a lighter option, try an egg white omelette filled with diced tomatoes, spinach, and mushrooms. Serve with a side of sliced avocado for a dose of healthy fats that will help keep you full longer.
* **Breakfast Burrito:** Wrap a filling of scrambled eggs, black beans, a sprinkle of low-fat cheese, and salsa in a whole wheat tortilla. This option is portable and can be prepped in advance for busy mornings.

Egg dishes offer the perfect balance of protein and flavor. They‚Äôre versatile enough to suit any palate and can be adapted to include a variety of nutrient-rich ingredients.

**4. Greek Yogurt Parfaits**

Greek yogurt is an excellent source of protein and probiotics, making it a great choice for breakfast. Layering it with fruits and a touch of granola creates a satisfying parfait that‚Äôs both delicious and visually appealing.

* **Simple Berry Parfait:** In a bowl or jar, layer 1 cup of low-fat Greek yogurt with fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries) and a sprinkle of granola. The berries provide antioxidants and fiber, while the granola adds a satisfying crunch.
* **Tropical Parfait:** Mix in diced mango and pineapple for a tropical twist. A drizzle of honey can add a bit of sweetness if desired.
* **Nutty Banana Parfait:** Slice a banana and layer it with a dollop of peanut butter and a handful of chopped walnuts. This combination delivers a mix of protein, healthy fats, and natural sugars.

Parfaits are not only easy to make but also offer a balanced mix of macronutrients. They‚Äôre perfect if you need something that‚Äôs both refreshing and filling.

**5. Whole Grain Toasts with a Twist**

Toast doesn‚Äôt have to be boring! Whole grain bread provides complex carbohydrates that give you lasting energy, and the toppings can be customized for both flavor and nutrition.

* **Avocado Toast with a Poached Egg:** Mash half an avocado and spread it over a slice of whole grain toast. Top with a poached egg and a pinch of salt, pepper, and red chili flakes. Avocado offers healthy fats, while the egg adds protein to keep you satisfied.
* **Cottage Cheese and Fruit Toast:** Spread low-fat cottage cheese over toasted whole grain bread and top with sliced strawberries or peaches. This option is light yet packed with protein and calcium.
* **Nut Butter and Banana Toast:** For a quick and sweet option, spread natural almond or peanut butter on whole grain toast and top with banana slices and a sprinkle of chia seeds.

These toasts are perfect for those mornings when you want something simple yet nourishing. They can be assembled in just a few minutes and provide a balanced mix of nutrients.

**Meal Prep Tips for Busy Mornings**

If you find your mornings are too hectic to whip up a nutritious breakfast, meal prep can be a lifesaver. Here are some practical tips to streamline your breakfast routine:

* **Plan Ahead:** Spend a little time on the weekend planning your breakfasts for the week. Decide which recipes you want to try and create a shopping list accordingly.
* **Batch Cook:** Prepare items like overnight oats, egg muffins, or smoothie packs in bulk. Store them in individual containers or jars, so they‚Äôre ready to grab and go.
* **Organize Your Kitchen:** Keep all your breakfast essentials‚Äîoats, fruits, nuts, and spices‚Äîin one easily accessible area. This way, you won‚Äôt waste time searching for ingredients when you‚Äôre in a rush.
* **Prep Ingredients the Night Before:** Wash and chop fruits, measure out your oats, and portion out nuts and seeds. Simple tasks like these can save you precious minutes in the morning.
* **Invest in Good Containers:** Use mason jars for overnight oats and smoothie bottles for blends. This not only keeps your food fresh but also makes transport a breeze if you need to take your breakfast to work.

With a little planning and organization, you can transform your mornings from a scramble into a smooth, stress-free routine that supports your weight loss goals.

**Balancing Nutrition with Convenience**

One of the biggest challenges when trying to lose weight is finding a balance between nutritious eating and convenience. It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of grabbing a sugary cereal or a processed snack because it‚Äôs quick. However, the key to sustainable weight loss is making choices that nourish your body without leaving you feeling deprived.

Incorporating a mix of macronutrients‚Äîproteins, fats, and carbohydrates‚Äîinto your breakfast can help maintain energy levels and reduce cravings later in the day. For instance, pairing protein (like eggs or Greek yogurt) with fiber-rich fruits and whole grains creates a breakfast that not only tastes great but also keeps you full until your next meal.

It‚Äôs also important to be mindful of portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients you use. Opt for whole, minimally processed foods over highly refined options. This approach not only aids in weight loss but also supports long-term health by providing essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

For those following a structured eating approach, you might consider integrating a carefully designed **low fat diet plan** into your overall lifestyle. (1) This type of plan can provide a clear framework for choosing foods that are naturally lower in calories while still being nutrient-dense. And when combined with other healthy eating strategies, it can be an effective tool for achieving your weight loss goals without sacrificing flavor or satisfaction.

**Personal Tips and Tricks for a Successful Breakfast Routine**

Over the years, I‚Äôve learned a few tricks that make it easier to stick to a healthy breakfast routine‚Äîeven on the busiest mornings. Here are some personal favorites that you might find helpful:

* **Set a Morning Ritual:** Even if you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúmorning person,‚Äù try to create a small ritual that signals the start of your day. This could be as simple as enjoying a cup of green tea while reviewing your to-do list. A calming routine can help you approach breakfast with a clear mind and a positive attitude.
* **Experiment with Flavors:** Don‚Äôt be afraid to mix up your ingredients. If you normally have the same bowl of oatmeal every day, try adding different fruits, spices, or even a spoonful of cocoa powder for a chocolatey twist. Variety keeps your taste buds excited and prevents breakfast from feeling like a chore.
* **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how different foods make you feel. If you notice that a heavy, carb-laden breakfast leaves you sluggish, consider switching to a lighter option like a protein smoothie or a vegetable omelette. Your body‚Äôs response is the best guide to what works for you.
* **Prep the Night Before:** On busy days, set aside just 10 minutes in the evening to prep your breakfast. Whether it‚Äôs assembling a parfait, soaking oats, or chopping fruit, a little effort before bed can make your morning much smoother.
* **Keep It Simple:** There‚Äôs no need to overcomplicate your breakfast. Simple, whole-food options often taste the best and provide the most balanced nutrition. Focus on recipes that require minimal ingredients and steps, so you‚Äôre not overwhelmed when time is short.

**Embracing Flexibility Without Sacrificing Health**

Healthy eating doesn‚Äôt have to mean strict rules and endless calorie counting. It‚Äôs about finding a balance that allows you to enjoy your food while still supporting your weight loss goals. The key is flexibility‚Äîbeing able to adjust your meals based on your schedule, preferences, and how your body feels.

For instance, if you know that one morning you‚Äôre short on time, have a backup plan ready. This might be a pre-made smoothie pack or a jar of overnight oats that you can quickly grab from the fridge. On days when you have more time, you can experiment with more elaborate recipes like a vegetable-packed frittata or a gourmet avocado toast topped with a poached egg and microgreens.

Even if you deviate from your planned breakfast every now and then, don‚Äôt stress about it. Consistency over time is what matters most. A few off days won‚Äôt derail your progress, as long as you return to your routine and continue making mindful choices. In the long run, building a sustainable breakfast routine is more important than achieving perfection every single day.

**Final Thoughts**

Transforming your breakfast routine is one of the most effective ways to support your weight loss journey. By choosing meals that are both quick and packed with nutrients, you set the stage for a day of balanced energy, controlled hunger, and healthier choices overall.

In this article, we‚Äôve explored a variety of breakfast options‚Äîfrom energizing smoothies and hearty overnight oats to savory egg dishes and creative whole grain toasts. We‚Äôve also shared practical meal prep tips and personal strategies to help you maintain a flexible yet consistent routine. Remember, a healthy breakfast isn‚Äôt about rigid rules; it‚Äôs about fueling your body with the right mix of protein, fiber, and healthy fats so you can feel your best every day.

If you‚Äôre ready to take your weight loss journey to the next level, consider exploring a structured eating strategy that fits your lifestyle. For instance, a carefully designed **low fat diet plan** can complement your breakfast routine by guiding you toward nutrient-dense, lower-calorie foods throughout the day.

By making breakfast a priority, you‚Äôre not only nourishing your body but also setting a positive tone for the rest of your day. So whether you‚Äôre blending up a vibrant smoothie, prepping overnight oats, or enjoying a savory egg scramble, know that each bite is a step toward a healthier, more energized you.

Here‚Äôs to waking up to delicious, quick, and healthy breakfasts that empower you to achieve your weight loss goals‚Äîone morning at a time!

You continue to browse the store, casually distributing those eggs in nooks and crannies of every department section until you‚Äôre out, then covertly dump the carton in the nearest trash can when you‚Äôre out. The ones that aren‚Äôt found will fester and rot after a month or so, and it will cost them lots in cleanup and lowered business because no one wants to shop in a stinky store. Might even have to shut the whole place down to deep clean, further hurting those corpo pocketbooks. Just a fun, harmless act of resistance if you‚Äôre feeling spunky üòò

EDIT: I feel like a lot of the commenters might be missing the point of this exercise. Please allow me to elaborate:

1. Taking a shit in an aisle is certainly nasty and while it might shut down a section of a store for a couple hours, it‚Äôs immediately identifiable as something that needs to be cleaned up, likely by some underpaid store employee. Rotting eggs spread throughout a store creates a slow burn stink, initially one that can be mistaken as farts or sewer gasses for about a week before it is identified as a real problem. During this time, folks will start avoiding an unusually stinky store. When the reality of the situation sets in for store managers, it‚Äôs too late to simply clean up with a mop, and more drastic measures (professional cleaners who choose to work at a cleaning company and literally do this work daily) are needed to eliminate the odor and find all of its sources. This costs the big box store money in lost revenue for the store shutdown and in cleanup costs, not to mention the lower customer turnout from the smell prior to its discovery. 

2. A dozen eggs in an act of defiance is a drop in the ocean in terms of wasting food. This type of rhetoric is reserved for folks who drive to a Starbucks and pat themselves on the back for choosing a paper straw in their slave labor coffee. It‚Äôs a viewpoint that lacks understanding of the full scope of meaningful change in a system.

3. Don‚Äôt do this at your local grocer. Matter of fact, go out and buy eggs from them after you play a Walmart egg game. This is specifically to make corpo stores unwelcoming to their sources of income - the customers. It‚Äôs working to make stock prices decline when enough people (doesn‚Äôt take that many) participate in the egg game and drive customers away from the unpleasant odor. It helps local grocers by sending customers to them, allowing more profit for the local store, which allow them to pay their own employees more (if they are an ethical business owner, of course). It‚Äôs a statement that you don‚Äôt accept monopolies for the sake of shareholder profit on the human right to healthy affordable food and necessities.

I have spent too much of my life hiding behind masks of varying degrees. I had a new friend recently help me to see just how much I'm missing out on by doing so, and I'm not going to do that any longer. 

That being said, let's get the sticky point out of the way first. I am trans, amab, and do not currently pass but I am working towards that goal.
If that hasn't put you off, please continue reading. It's just safer to get that out of the way now.

So here i am, I all my glory. 

I'm 37. Wow. Where do the years go? Well, if you made the same mistakes I did, you got a little too much into drinking in college and wound up wasting about a decade just scraping by, doing the bare minimum. Lesson learned.

Now, though, I think I'm doing good. I've gone from feeling like I've wasted my life to instead trying to just enjoy it.

How? Well, I like to say my main hobby is collecting hobbies! Recently I got into fountain pens and inks (oh, so many pretty colors!) and I'm kinda teaching myself to sew. Last year I tried my hand at making chainmail jewelery. 

But if you want to talk things I keep coming back to, the main one is reading. I enjoy most genres, but classic sci-fi is my go-to. Aasimov, Vonnegut, Arthur C. Clarke are all in heavy rotation. Sci-fi TV shows and movies, too. 

I enjoy gardening, when I'm able to. Living in an apartment limits my ability, but hopefully I will one day have a place with a yard I can turn into a food forest. Or at the very least a decent garden to can from.

I'm very much a homebody. Sitting next to each other reading our books silently is as much quality time to me as doing some activity together. That being said, I also enjoy hiking through the woods and just spending time outdoors. Not so much in the winter, though. Winter is for hot coffee or cocoa and curling up under a pile of blankets. 

Whew. I think that's the longest post I've ever created. I'd like to think I have a lot more to add here, but I'm afraid if I try it'll just turn into some sort of rambling stream of consciousness post with no clear point.",0,1740060924.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,0.17,False
