can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Or clingy ?,"So I (29)matched on tinder with that guy(32) a month ago and we met the same day to grab a drink and talk. It was great we talk and laugh a lot, I am not very good at small talks but I think we had a great night.it was late and he wanted to go eat but everything was closed and he was insisting on grabbing something and going to my place because he lives with is sister (???). I politely told him no. We scheduled an other date and he wanted to watch anime because we had that in common, I usually don’t bring people over but I liked him so I agreed. We had a great night we kissed and he left at 3am. Second date he came over again at night because apparently he play basketball in 2 different clubs almost every evening. Great night but I start realizing that we don’t talk much but I thought it was because of the tension because we were getting intimate. Leaving late again it’s 4am and I realize is phone is on airplane mode 💀

I am getting suspicious because in addition it’s very difficult to talk to him because he only start texting after 3 to 6 pm and takes hours to reply so we never had a proper conversation. 

Third date come over again, he doesn’t really care about asking me questions but I didn’t mind because I wanted to believe that it was to early to judge him we got more intimate but something felt off because I didn’t trust him.

Phone also on airplane mode that night. But he didn’t use it at all.  

I ask him if he had a girlfriend because that could explain is behavior otherwise he was not really interested. He told me no soooo… I got pissed because why are u wasting my time and yours ( we agreed we didn’t want to start anything serious right away and just go with the flow) so if u don’t like me leave. 

A week goes by barely any texting because of his  late replies. We meet because lent him a scarf, he was physically affectionate per usual but didn’t ask anything about my week or my day but proceeded to talk about himself for 45 minutes, I was annoyed and tried to give him hints about my frustration but he said that he is barely in his phone without over explaining. 

We left the coffee shop and I want home leaving him with our usual kiss or even a look just saying bye and good night. 

It was last week. 

No text no contact. 

I go on my hinge and bumble with a friend and who his popping on my feed with the new member tag 🤡

He stills follow me on instagram but doesn’t look at my stories anymore. 

I feel like I did something wrong even though I know he wasn’t acting like someone who cared even in a casual relationship. ",1,1771418396.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So my workplace is 4 days a week in office. I usually go to the breakout area to get a coffee from the machine as soon as I log in at my desk, and today I heard a conversation between 2 women and 1 man, presumably colleagues in the same team. All of them were older to me by about 15 years, give or take.

The man seemed to be a father to a toddler (or baby) boy and was arguing how he'd like a girl child next, and while the translations aren't entirely accurate, one of the two women were like "" You're lucky you have a boy, raising a girl is way more high maintenance than a boy! ""

The other woman was much more rational saying ""It's not like that, both are more or less the same, both are equal"" yada yada

I mean, why have a kid at all? Not having a kid has ZERO ""maintenance"". Blud already has one and in my country preschool is close to USD 3000 (about 3 lakh INR, a big number for the average Indian today) and planning a second child seems like financial suicide, not to mention actually RAISING the child (surprise surprise)

For Indians, the sole purpose of their existence (right from getting good grades to getting a good job) is all ""mandatory"" in order to get married to a good man/woman and breed and pop out 2 kids minimum. Anything contrary to this opinion is being ""disrespectful to elders"" or considered heresy enough to get you ostracized and I'm sick of it.

Couldn't help but smirk to myself on the way back to my desk lmao

On **Sunday, February 15**, [**Omi.me**](http://omi.me/) **Hackathon BLR** sold out and brought together **229 attendees** for a full day of shipping, demos, and nonstop conversation about AI wearables.

The hackathon was hosted by **Vipin Pharkya**, **Aarav Garg**, and **Deepak Chawla**, with support from **Indori VC**, **OJone Inc**, and **HiDevs**. The goal was straightforward. Build AI apps with Omi, the wearable that captures conversations and turns them into actionable insights.

 

# Event snapshot

* **Event:** [Omi.me](http://omi.me/) Hackathon BLR by Indori VC x OJone
* **Date:** Sunday, February 15
* **Time:** 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (GMT+5:30)
* **City:** Bengaluru, Karnataka
* **Attendees:** 229
* **Hosts:** Vipin Pharkya, Aarav Garg, Deepak Chawla
* **Partners:** Indori VC, OJone Inc, HiDevs
* **Format:** build sprints, demo showcase, awards

 

# A builder day. built for momentum

This was a true builder format. Doors open, quick welcome, long build blocks, then demos. Ten hours of building, networking, and nerding out on AI wearables. No long speeches. Just shipping.

Builders came in with different strengths, so the event made it easy to pick a lane and start fast. Teams worked on:

* **Prompt-based apps**, like meeting summaries, daily journals, and decision logs
* **Integrations** with tools like Notion, Slack, and HubSpot
* **Real-time notification workflows** for in-the-moment assistance
* **Open-source contributions** that expand the platform for everyone

Another detail people appreciated. You did not need an Omi device to participate. A laptop and the phone app were enough to build. The best projects earned free Omi devices, and there was also a community offer for those who wanted hardware in hand.

 

# The schedule. simple and effective

The day ran on a tight flow that kept energy high:

* **10:00 to 10:30** doors open and networking
* **10:30 to 10:45** welcome, partner intros, and how the day flows
* **10:45 to 1:15** build sprint
* **1:15 to 2:00** lunch
* **2:00 to 3:30** sprint continues and submissions begin
* **3:30 to 4:30** demo showcase and feedback, featuring top teams
* **4:30 to 5:00** wrap-up, awards, and closing

Closing with samosa, chai, and coffee was a perfect Bengaluru touch.

 

# Partners, volunteers, and the people who made it real

Vipin’s recap captured the spirit of the day. This was a community-built event. Not one person doing everything, but a full crew making it happen.

He thanked the Omi team, specifically **Aarav**, **Mohammed Mohsin**, **Nik**, and **Hugo A.**, plus the partners and organizers who brought it to life.

Shoutouts also went to everyone at **OJone Inc**, including **Venkat**, **Shyam**, **Sundar**, **Padmaja**, and **Chinna**, and to **Deepak** from **HiDevs**.

And because every great hackathon runs on people who show up early, stay late, and solve problems fast, Vipin called out an army of volunteers. **Mithil**, **Disha**, **G Surya**, and **Hemanth A N**, plus special thanks to **Anuj Khetan** and **Vaibhav K.** for helping out.

 

# Judging, demos, and shipping in public

The demo showcase was the heartbeat of the day. Top teams got time to show what they built, get rapid feedback, and earn community attention. Projects ranged from prompt apps to integrations, with prizes including free Omi devices and more.

Vipin also announced the jury ahead of time and set expectations clearly. This was about clarity, real usefulness, and shipping something you can show.

People built some great stuff with Omi, and Vipin mentioned he would share a separate post to highlight projects because there was too much to fit in one recap.

 

# What everyone asked next.

One comment on the recap said it plainly. “Great team, congrats. Thrilled to see you building the Omi ecosystem. Can’t wait for the next event, when will it happen.”

The momentum was strong enough that the “next event” conversation started immediately. Vipin shared an idea that fits the energy in the room. **Run one every month.** Keep the flywheel going.

And yes, the next city already came up. **Toronto**.

# A builder day. built for momentum

This was a true builder format. Doors open, quick welcome, long build blocks, then demos. Ten hours of building, networking, and nerding out on AI wearables. No long speeches. Just shipping.

Builders came in with different strengths, so the event made it easy to pick a lane and start fast. Teams worked on:

* **Prompt-based apps**, like meeting summaries, daily journals, and decision logs
* **Integrations** with tools like Notion, Slack, and HubSpot
* **Real-time notification workflows** for in-the-moment assistance
* **Open-source contributions** that expand the platform for everyone

Another detail people appreciated. You did not need an Omi device to participate. A laptop and the phone app were enough to build. The best projects earned free Omi devices, and there was also a community offer for those who wanted hardware in hand.

 

# The schedule. simple and effective

The day ran on a tight flow that kept energy high:

* **10:00 to 10:30** doors open and networking
* **10:30 to 10:45** welcome, partner intros, and how the day flows
* **10:45 to 1:15** build sprint
* **1:15 to 2:00** lunch
* **2:00 to 3:30** sprint continues and submissions begin
* **3:30 to 4:30** demo showcase and feedback, featuring top teams
* **4:30 to 5:00** wrap-up, awards, and closing

Closing with samosa, chai, and coffee was a perfect Bengaluru touch.

Focusing on major turning points, individual stories and key places, from Mecca to Cordoba, from Damascus to Venice, and from Vienna to Istanbul, Drayson tracks the themes that unite us – classical learning preserved in Islamic libraries, the enduring influence of Moorish architecture and design, the food we share, the goods we have traded and the continuing dialogue between individuals and cultures that has permeated Europe’s history and shaped its borders.

It is a history that sweeps across cities and continents, from Spanish patios and palaces to Ottoman-inspired coffee houses in 17th century London, to the Mezquita in Cordoba, once a mosque, now a cathedral, the physical embodiment of the ongoing discourse that continues to shape European identity.

## TRICK #42: Error Injection
### Simulating Imperfection Through Deliberate Prompt Chaos

**Reliability: ★☆☆☆☆ Very Low (High Risk)**

> **EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE & HIGH RISK**: This technique intentionally introduces chaos into your prompt. Results are completely unpredictable. May produce unusable output.

---

### Before You Try This

If you want imperfect, lo-fi, raw, or demo-quality output, **try standard descriptors first**:

```
lo-fi, raw recording, demo quality, tape hiss, bedroom production, DIY aesthetic, cassette 4-track, imperfect timing, unpolished
```

These are well-understood terms. Suno knows what they mean. They work reliably.

Error Injection is for when those descriptors are **too clean**, too predictable, too intentional. When you want something that feels genuinely unplanned, not ""designed to sound unplanned"".

If standard lo-fi prompting gives you what you need, skip this trick entirely.

---

### What This Trick Actually Does

You deliberately break your own prompt by including:
- **Typos and informal language** (""likee,"" ""idk,"" ""lol"")
- **Uncertainty markers** (""??"", ""maybe,"" ""kinda"")
- **Conversational hedging** (""but like... more vibes???"")
- **Self-contradiction** (""fast but slow,"" ""clean but dirty"")
- **Incomplete thoughts** (""something like... you know"")
- **Non-standard punctuation** (excessive question marks, ellipses, emoji-adjacent language)

You are not writing instructions. You are writing **anti-instructions**.

---

### Why This Sometimes Works

Suno's training data might not exclusively paired with clean, professional style descriptions. A fraction of it likely includes:

- Informal user-generated tags and descriptions
- Forum posts and social media discussions about music
- Casual metadata from bedroom producers and amateurs
- Content associated with DIY, demo, and lo-fi culture

When your prompt reads like a casual text message instead of a production spec, you **may** activate associations with that informal corner of the training data, the part where music was described by people who didn't know the ""correct"" terminology.

The informal language pattern also creates **ambiguity**, which forces the model to interpolate. When the AI can't resolve clear instructions, it falls back on probabilistic averaging, and that sometimes produces results that feel genuinely undecided, unfinished, or in-between.

This is the same reason why Trick #38 (Temporal Contradiction Forcing) sometimes works: confusion as a creative tool.

---

### The Real Mechanism (Honest Assessment)

Here's what's probably happening:

- The AI **strips or ignores** the informal markers (""likee,"" ""idk,"" ""lol"") -- these are not musical descriptors
- The AI **reads the actual keywords** embedded in the mess (""demo recording,"" ""bedroom production,"" ""raw,"" ""imperfect"")
- Those keywords do the work
- The informal language either does nothing, or introduces small amounts of randomness by reducing the AI's confidence in what you want

**The informal language is probably not a feature, but noise.**

But -- and this is the key -- that noise occasionally produces results you could not have predicted or requested. Not because the chaos was interpreted, but because the chaos reduced the AI's certainty, widening the probability space. And wider probability space sometimes contains gems.

That's not control. It's lottery ticket buying with slightly better odds.

---

### Types of Error Injection

#### Type 1: Conversational Chaos

Write your prompt like a tipsy text message:

```
Rock but likee... more ?? vibes??? idk kinda unfinished feeling lol, demo recording, bedroom production, imperfect but real, DIY aesthetic, maybe (95-105 BPM)?? raw and messy but genuine, mistakes included
```

#### Type 2: Self-Contradictory Instructions

Stack opposing descriptors to force the AI to compromise:

```
Fast but slow, heavy but light, polished but raw, professional demo, beautiful disaster, organized chaos, precise sloppiness, (100-110 BPM), lo-fi high-fidelity
```

#### Type 3: Incomplete Thought Stream

Write as if you're thinking out loud and never finished:

```
Something like... indie? but not really, more like if you recorded a band in a kitchen at 2am and the tape was running out and nobody really... you know, (90-100 BPM), that FEELING when a song is almost good but not quite and that's what makes it
```

#### Type 4: Wrong Vocabulary on Purpose

Describe music using non-musical words, forcing the AI to translate:

```
Sounds like the color of a rainy Tuesday, wobbly, tastes like cold coffee, the musical equivalent of an unmade bed, comfortable ugly, (85-95 BPM), if nostalgia had bad posture
```

#### Type 5: Technical Gibberish

Mix real and fake technical terms:

```
Reverse sidechain on the feelings, 3dB of sadness, detuned emotions, the kick drum is existential, hi-hat anxiety, (105-115 BPM), mix buss melancholy, master bus regret
```

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Prompt 1: The Original**

**Style:**
```
Rock but likee... more ?? vibes??? idk kinda unfinished feeling lol, demo recording, bedroom production, imperfect but real, DIY aesthetic, maybe (95-105 BPM)?? raw and messy but genuine, mistakes included
```

**Prompt 2: The Beautiful Disaster**

**Style:**
```
idk man just like... a song?? maybe indie rock ish but like that feeling when you're recording at 3am and everything's kinda falling apart but it sounds weirdly good?? tape machine dying, guitar amp buzzing, singer forgot some words lol, (95-105 BPM) ish, beautiful disaster energy
```

**Prompt 3: The Contradictions**

**Style:**
```
Perfectly imperfect, professional amateur hour, hi-fi lo-fi, expensive cheap sound, tight sloppy drums, clean distortion, organized mess of a song, (100-110 BPM), sounds like a million dollar demo tape, polished garage rock
```

**Prompt 4: The Kitchen Recording**

**Style:**
```
Recorded in someone's kitchen at 2am, everyone's a little tired, the acoustic guitar has one dead string, someone's phone buzzes during the bridge, you can hear the fridge humming, (85-95 BPM), folk song that was never meant to be heard by anyone, accidentally beautiful
```

**Prompt 5: The Glitch**

**Style:**
```
This prompt has a bug in it, the song should sound like a corrupted mp3 that's somehow still beautiful, digital artifacts where the chorus should be, the verse works fine but everything else is ??? (95-105 BPM), electronic pop but the computer was having a bad day, glitchcore lullaby
```

**What it might trigger:**
- Digital corruption aesthetics
- Glitch/IDM associations
- ""Corrupted mp3"" is a specific, evocative descriptor
- ""Computer having a bad day"" is genuinely funny prompt language that might map to specific training data

---

### Genre Compatibility

**Works best with genres that embrace imperfection:**

| Genre | Why It Works | Best Error Type |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Bedroom pop | Imperfection IS the genre | Conversational chaos, incomplete thoughts |
| Lo-fi hip hop | Degradation is aesthetic | Self-contradiction, wrong vocabulary |
| Garage rock/punk | Rawness is ideology | Conversational chaos, kitchen recording |
| Shoegaze | Blur and noise expected | Self-contradiction |
| Vaporwave | Corrupted/decontextualized | Technical gibberish, glitch |
| Noise/experimental | Chaos is the point | Any type, go wild |
| Indie folk | Intimacy, vulnerability | Incomplete thoughts, scene descriptions |

**Almost never works with:**

| Genre | Why It Fails |
|-------|-------------|
| Modern pop | Needs precision, chaos produces garbage |
| EDM/House | Timing errors destroy the groove |
| Classical | Just sounds like a bad recording |
| Metal | Needs tight execution even when raw |
| K-pop | Hyper-produced by definition |

---

### When This Fails

**Most of the time.**

Specific failure modes:

- **AI ignores the chaos entirely** - produces clean, polished output because it extracted the 3-4 real keywords and discarded everything else
- **Complete gibberish** - no musical structure, unusable noise
- **Wrong kind of imperfect** - you wanted charming lo-fi, you got bad mix with no character
- **Genre override** - the genre keyword is stronger than all your chaos combined, output sounds standard
- **Literal interpretation** - AI tries to generate actual phone buzzing or fridge humming (this can happen and is usually awful)
- **Inconsistent** - same prompt gives completely different results each time (more than usual Suno variance)

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Generate at LEAST 5 variations** - success rate is very low, volume is your only lever
- **Save anything remotely interesting immediately** - you will not reproduce it
- **Embed 2-3 real keywords in the mess ** - ""bedroom production,"" ""demo recording,"" ""raw"" give the AI something to grab onto
- **Keep a ""chaos journal""** - when something works, save the exact prompt even if it looks ridiculous
- **Pair with high Weirdness setting (70-85%)** - if you are already embracing chaos, lean in
- **Accept the failure rate** - this trick exists for the 1-in-10 (or 1-in-100) surprise that makes you sit back and say ""how did it do THAT?""

---

### The Fundamental Truth

> **You are not controlling imperfection. You are inviting randomness and hoping it's beautiful.**

That's it. There's no deeper mechanism. You break the prompt, the AI gets confused, and sometimes confusion produces something human-sounding, because humans are confused, imperfect, contradictory creatures, and music that reflects that can be more moving than anything polished.

But mostly, confusion just produces confusion.

Use this trick when you have exhausted everything else, when you are bored of your own competence, when you want to be surprised. Don't use it when you need results.

1r81p0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FoundationThin5267/comments/1r81p0o/moved_to_tokyo_2years_ago_heres_what_i_wish/,Moved to Tokyo 2years ago. Here's what I wish someone had told me about making friends here,"I spent my first year in Tokyo feeling lonely despite having ""lots of people to meet up with."" Took me way too long to figure out why.

Here's what I learned:

The Problem Isn't Meeting People

Tokyo has thousands of:

\- Meetup events

\- Networking groups

\- Language exchanges

\- Expat bars



You can meet 50 new people in a month easy. The problem is going from ""nice to meet you"" to actual friendship.



What Actually Works:

1. Stop optimizing for breadth

I was trying to meet as many people as possible. Wrong approach.

Instead: Pick 8-12 people you actually click with. See them regularly. Month after month.



2. Structure beats spontaneity

""Let's grab coffee sometime"" never happens.

""Coffee every Wednesday at 11 AM"" actually happens.

Friendships need consistency. Tokyo won't give you that naturally. You have to build it.



3. Give it 6 months minimum

Month 1-2: Awkward small talk

Month 3-4: Starting to feel familiar

Month 5-6: Actually becoming friends

I kept quitting after 6 weeks thinking ""this isn't working."" Wrong. I was quitting right before it would work.



4. Small groups are everything

40-person events: Zero friendships

8-person coffee gatherings: Several real friends

You can't go deep with crowds.



5. Tokyo requires active effort

In some cities, friendships happen passively (shared apartment building, neighborhood bar, etc). Tokyo isn't built that way. You have to be intentional.



What I Did:

Started hosting weekly coffee gatherings. Swedish fika tradition - just intentional time for conversation.

Same cafe. Same time. Every week. For months.

First few weeks only 2-3 people showed up. Kept going anyway.

After about 4 months, I had 8-10 regulars. After 8 months, some of those people became actual friends I could call on a random Tuesday.



The Principle:

You don't need a big community. You need 3-5 people you actually know.

Tokyo makes it easy to collect contacts. Hard to build friendships.



The fix: Consistency + small groups + time.



My Advice:

Don't try to ""make friends."" That's too vague.



Instead:

\- Find ONE weekly thing (hobby, sport, coffee, whatever)

\- Show up every single week for 6 months

\- Talk to the same 8-12 people who also show up

\- Let familiarity turn into friendship



It's boring advice. But it works.



Anyone else figure this out the hard way?",1,1771417754.0,u_FoundationThin5267,0,1.0,False

Yes, Bungie doesn't tell you anything. Bungie doesn't show up, communicate or whatever. SO WHAT?! There is no obligation to do this. There is no binding contract that YOU MUST PLAY/BUY each DLC /expansion/Episode whatever you migh call it. Nobody force you to keep playing Destiny. You can walk away, play some other games, enjoy dinner with your wife/husband and play with your kids, like 99% of other Destiny players do. There are so many games outside. 

The current remaining whining playerbase are like junkies begging for more stuff, even they know, it's not healthy for them. Play through the new content 24/7h like it's a real time job and come to forum to whine again for no content.

Just leave, come back every 1once per year like me and you have enough content to enjoy for a full month. You can spend the reminiang 11 months for other games, Kids and wife/grilfriend/boyfriend whatever. 

Even every second day complaining no news won't help much. Vote with your wallet, vote with your valuable time. Stop log-in daily and let them do their job. If they don't cook, just play something else. 

Last free tip: Thanx to Bungie you have more spare time. Visit your parents, they spent so much money, time and effort to raise you up. But you just behave like a whining child in forum. If your are lucky enough, go visit you grand parents. They would love to see you and eat a cake and drink a coffee with you.

I tested cheap knockoffs and they work fine for a week, maybe two, then the vacuum seal fails or the lid warps.

If you’re mostly using it for cold drinks or casual daily use, cheaper tumblers will do the job. Hot coffee or tea is where the difference shows—lids matter a lot, and some cheap ones leach paint or degrade quickly. Hand washing cheap steel bottles extends their life way more than tossing them in the dishwasher.

I’ve seen RTIC and Ozark Trail hold up decently, but even then some lids or coatings won’t last as long as Yeti. For me, durability, lid design, and ease of cleaning are the real cost difference, not a few extra degrees of temperature retention.

I’ve also personally dropped off-brand tumblers down stairs and they survived just fine, so a lot of the hype is the brand name. If you care about longevity and minimal hassle, Yeti is worth it.

Japan has drawn up plans for investments in US oil, gas and critical mineral projects worth about $36bn under the first wave of a deal with [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump).

The US president and Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s prime minister, announced a trio of projects including a power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, billed by the Trump administration as the largest natural gas-fired generating facility in US history.

As a diplomatic row between Japan and China over the security of Taiwan continues, [testing the Japanese economy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/17/china-lunar-new-year-2026-chinese-tourists-shun-japan), Takaichi said the projects would strengthen her country’s ties with the US.[](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/trump-critical-minerals-stockpile-project-vault)

While Takaichi did not directly mention [China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/china), she expressed hope in a statement that the investments would enhance Japanese and US economic security.

“Our massive trade deal with Japan has just launched,” Trump declared in a social media post. The White House said Japan would also invest in a deepwater crude oil export facility off the coast of Texas, and a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing site.

The projects are the first batch of the $550bn Japan committed to invest under a [trade deal with the US](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/trump-announces-japan-trade-deal-after-weeks-of-fraught-negotiations) last year. In return, Trump agreed to reduce US tariffs on Japanese exports including cars.

“The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, tariffs,” Trump claimed on Tuesday. His controversial trade strategy alarmed economists in the US, who warned it risked exacerbating inflation.

Most of the first wave of investment will go towards the plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, which will generate 9.2 gigawatts of electricity each year, according to the administration. It will be operated by SB Energy, which is a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.

The industrial diamond manufacturing site in Georgia, valued at about $600m, is designed to ensure the US can fully produce all the synthetic diamond grit – a critical material for advanced manufacturing and semiconductors – it requires domestically. The project “will end our foolish dependence on foreign sources”, said Trump.

China controls much of the critical minerals market, dominating the world’s mining and processing of rare earths that are essential across a wide array of industries, from oil refining to car manufacturing.

Beijing has not hesitated to wield this dominance, imposing restrictions on global imports of its rare earths. Such curbs were at the heart of an [economic spat with Washington](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade) last year. While Trump and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, reached a deal last October which reduced tensions in the short term, US officials have repeatedly spoken of the need to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals.

Beijing has started in recent months to restrict some exports of rare earths to Japan, amid a row with Tokyo over Taiwan. Takaichi angered Chinese officials in November 2025 by suggesting [Japan could become militarily involved](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/japan-china-row-takaichi-taiwan-conflict-military-deployment) in the event of an attempted Chinese invasion of the self-governing island.

“We will no longer rely on foreign supply for this essential material,” Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, said of the planned industrial diamond project.

“Japan is providing the capital,” added Lutnick. “The infrastructure is being built in the United States. The proceeds are structured so Japan earns its return, and America gains strategic assets, expanded industrial capacity, and strengthened energy dominance.”

Japan reported on Wednesday that its exports rose almost 17% in January, driven in part by a sharp rise in exports to China despite the current tensions.

# Feb. 18th, 2026~US agencies have developed critical minerals price floor system

[US agencies have developed critical minerals price floor system - The Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/energy-commodities/us-agencies-have-developed-critical-minerals-price-floor-system)

[Price floors have long been discussed among critical minerals industry players as a way to shield non-Chinese companies from the Asian nation flooding markets. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG](https://preview.redd.it/s46d2khdk8kg1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5613c39d87ddcae2769ef2644508a91ca143e8e)

\[NEW YORK\] The US has developed a critical minerals price floor system that it’s pitching to allies as the Trump administration and more than 50 countries look to reduce dependence on China for the resources that are deemed critical to national security.

Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Jacob Helberg said multiple US agencies have developed the system and are having conversations with allies and partners. It’s the latest update to progress being made by the US and its allies to ringfence Western companies from China’s pressure on those markets.

“We have had multiple agencies take a close look at this. They have developed a very, very sophisticated price floor system that we are having conversations with our allies and partners about,” Helberg said. “We are very excited about it because pricing is the key to unlocking private investment.”

His comments come less than two weeks since the US hosted 55 nations at a critical minerals summit during which the Trump administration pitched price floors and a major role for private equity as part of a broad plan to reduce supply chain dependence on China. 

At the same time, there’s been very little detail made available to investors and other market participants around how the parties will formulate a pricing mechanism, how it would be implemented and when they may roll out the system.

Price floors have long been discussed among critical minerals industry players as a way to shield non-Chinese companies from the Asian nation flooding markets and depressing Western firms’ profits.

Helberg, who’s made many public remarks in the last few weeks around the Trump administration’s aggressive critical minerals policy, said ultimately the price floors will be rolled out through Pax Silica, a US-led alliance to strengthen supply chains. BLOOMBERG

[Independent testing has shown RapidSX can separate rare earths nearly 10 times faster while occupying roughly one-third the space of traditional mixer-settler units.](https://preview.redd.it/jxqsijiqi8kg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfd3037f825635d894a5af049b0d3c889136ee69)

# DOW-backed RapidSX outperforms Chinese separation methods.

Backed by more than $22 million in U.S. Department of War (DOW) funding and a growing network of feedstock suppliers, technology partners, and downstream magnet manufacturers, Ucore Rare Metals Inc. has submitted its final reporting under the initial phase of a program designed to prove that its proprietary RapidSX separation technology can outperform the conventional methods China has used to dominate rare earth refining for decades.

The report, delivered to the U.S. Army Contracting Command – Orlando, included both a final demonstration report and a final techno-economic analysis detailing the work conducted at Ucore's RapidSX Commercialization and Demonstration Facility in Kingston, Ontario – a semi-commercial, 52-stage plant where the company has been scaling the technology from lab-tested concept toward commercial readiness.

The challenge at the heart of that work has kept Western nations dependent on China for decades – separating the tightly interlocked suite of rare earths into individual elements usable by industry, for everything from electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators to precision-guided missiles and advanced robotics, requires sophisticated chemical processes.

Conventional solvent extraction – the only method currently deployed at significant commercial scale – relies on enormous plants with large banks of mixer-settler units that are time- and labor-intensive to operate.

Rather than reinvent the underlying chemistry, Ucore's RapidSX applies those same proven principles through proprietary, patent-pending column-based technology that reaches chemical equilibrium faster within a substantially smaller physical footprint, with independent testing showing the platform can separate rare earths nearly 10 times faster while occupying roughly one-third the space of traditional mixer-settler units.

Under phase one of its agreement with DOW, Ucore set out to validate RapidSX at its Ontario demonstration facility against commercial-scale benchmarks.

The program generated approximately 6,000 hours of run time on the RapidSX Demonstration Plant in a simulated commercial production environment, producing thousands of liters of praseodymium-neodymium, samarium-europium-gadolinium, samarium, gadolinium, terbium, and dysprosium chloride products, along with additional small-batch oxide products.

More than 10,000 recovery and purity data points were collected in a head-to-head comparison with a neighboring conventional SX pilot plant also constructed by Ucore at the Ontario facility, demonstrating RapidSX's efficacy with respect to planned commercial operational parameters and capital deployment.

Central to the phase one mandate was the processing of metric tons of real-world heavy mixed rare earth oxide feedstock through computerized RapidSX columns versus conventional SX mixer-settler units, addressing both the refining of heavy rare earths and the separation of samarium and gadolinium – elements crucial to national defense, green energy, EVs, and emerging industries.

With the initial phase concluded, Phase 2 of the agreement – executed in May 2025 – is underway, with five of 20 milestones completed to date.

This next stage will culminate in the construction, commissioning, and demonstration of one commercial-scale RapidSX machine at Ucore's Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, where subsequent machines installed in series will form the first stage of 2,500 metric tons per annum of total rare earth oxide processing.

""Breaking the Chinese advantages of state-backed processing capacity requires a 21st-century approach with digital manufacturing savvy and a reasonable deployment of capital,"" said Ucore Rare Metals CEO Pat Ryan. ""The completion of the Phase I Report for the DOW under our OTA and a path to commercialization with Phase 2 financial support clearly shows processing independence has become a national security priority for the US Administration worthy of sustained investment.""

Ucore anticipates releasing more detailed information on the project's results and the techno-economic analysis upon formal acceptance by the U.S. Army Contracting Command – Orlando, which is expected in the coming weeks.

# Key Takeaways

**1**

President Trump announced a project to develop a critical and rare-earth minerals reserve, called “Project Vault,” to reduce reliance on Chinese rare-earth minerals.

**2**

The reserve will be “for civilian use in times of emergency,” buying and storing minerals for American manufacturers, as the United States currently has a stockpile of minerals for defense purposes.

**3**

The stockpile, a concept similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, would be financed with about $2 billion in private funds and a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

**4**

In 2024, the United States was entirely reliant on imports for 12 critical minerals, and imported 50% or more of 29 others.

**5**

Critical minerals include rare earths, cobalt, graphite, silicon, copper, nickel, titanium, and lithium, which are critical to the supply chains of many modern products, such as electric vehicle batteries, semiconductors, and smartphones.

President Trump is launching a [$12 billion stockpile of critical and rare-earth minerals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rare-earth-minerals-stockpile-12-billion/), called “Project Vault,” to reduce reliance on Chinese rare earths and curb China’s leverage in trade talks. President Trump indicated the reserve will be “for civilian use in times of emergency,” buying and storing minerals for American manufacturers, as the United States currently has a stockpile of minerals for defense purposes. The stockpile, a concept similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, would be financed with about $2 billion in private funds and a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. *CBS News* reports that, in 2024, the United States was entirely reliant on imports for 12 critical minerals, and imported 50% or more of 29 others. Critical minerals include rare earths, cobalt, graphite, silicon, copper, nickel, titanium, and lithium, which are critical to the supply chains of many modern products, such as electric vehicle batteries, semiconductors, and smartphones.

The minerals kept in the reserve would help to shield the manufacturers of vehicles, electronics, and other goods from supply chain disruptions, ensuring they have reliable access even during periods of market volatility or geopolitical challenges. During trade talks last year following President Trump’s tariffs, China restricted exports of rare earths, which are needed for jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles, laptops, and phones, prompting some U.S. manufacturers to reduce output. China [controls](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/rare-earths-china-bargaining-chip-trade-war-us.html) about 70% of the world’s rare earth mining and 90% of global rare earths processing.

According to [*GlobalData*](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-announces-12bn-critical-mineral-stockpile-to-reduce-reliance-on-china/ar-AA1VAHBK), companies using Project Vault will need to commit to purchasing materials ahead of any price shock at agreed-upon prices and pay upfront fees for preferred access. Project Vault will identify and store the minerals and maintain the inventory. Commodities trading firms Hartree Partners, Traxys North America, and Mercuria Energy Group are tasked with procuring the minerals. Manufacturers can draw minerals against their allotment from the reserve when needed, with the [obligation to replenish the stockpile](https://gizmodo.com/trump-announces-minerals-stockpile-way-too-late-for-it-to-spare-him-from-embarrassment-by-china-2000717079) afterwards. A [key aspect](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-announces-12bn-critical-mineral-stockpile-to-reduce-reliance-on-china/ar-AA1VAHBK) of the venture is stabilizing market volatility by ensuring manufacturers repurchase materials at their original price. A number of companies (e.g., General Motors, Stellantis, Boeing, Corning, GE Verona, and Google) are involved in Project Vault. The project’s detailed structure is still being finalized.

The government-backed loan funding the reserve will cover a period of [15 years](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/trump-critical-minerals-stockpile-project-vault). The [Export-Import Bank’s board voted to approve the loan](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5718617-trump-minerals-stockpile-rare-earth/), which would be its largest ever. The Trump administration has also sought to enhance domestic mineral production and processing through investments and international alliances with countries like [Australia](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/trump-signs-critical-mineral-agreement-with-australia/), Japan, and [Malaysia](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/trump-signs-trade-deals-with-four-southeast-asian-countries/).

Interior Secretary [Doug Burgum said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/trump-critical-minerals-stockpile-project-vault) 11 additional countries would be announced for the initiative later this week.

**U.S. Investments in Critical Minerals**

According to [*Al Jazeera*](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile), in 2025, the Trump administration acquired equity stakes in a number of companies by converting federal grants into ownership positions. The United States has a 10% percent stake in USA Rare Earth, which plans to build rare earth element and magnet production facilities in the United States, with commercial production beginning in 2028. The project is funded by $1.6 billion from the CHIPS Act, passed during Biden’s presidency.

The U.S. government also acquired about a [10% stake, valued at around $1.9 billion](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile), in Korea Zinc to help fund a $7.4 billion smelter in Tennessee through a joint venture with the U.S. government and U.S.-based strategic investors. The venture will operate a mining complex anchored by two mines and the only operational zinc smelter in the United States. Construction is to begin this year, with commercial operations expected to start in 2029.

In October, the U.S. government [announced](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile) a $35.6 million investment to acquire a 10% stake in Canadian-based Trilogy Metals to support the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in Alaska. The investment supports the development of critical minerals, including copper, zinc, gold, and silver, in Alaska’s Ambler mining district in the northwest. President Biden slowed the development of the Ambler mining district [by refusing to permit a right-of-way on federal land](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/regulation/biden-harris-administration-suspends-water-and-wetlands-permit-for-ambler-mining-road-in-alaska/) necessary to reach the mining area.

Also in October, the United States announced a [5% stake in Lithium Americas](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/trumps-energy-department-invests-5-in-lithium-assets/) as part of a joint venture with General Motors to fund operations at the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. The project will supply lithium for electric vehicles.

The *Associated Press* reports that the Trump administration and private investors are partnering with Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies in a [$1.4 billion deal](https://apnews.com/article/vulcan-reelement-rare-earths-us-government-investment-17647d7219ab8b8098fce5fc66975fdd). Vulcan Elements manufactures rare earth magnets, while ReElement processes rare earth mineral ores and recycles old batteries and other products made with rare earths.

In July, the White House announced a [15% investment in MP Materials](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/regulation/u-s-defense-department-takes-a-stake-in-a-rare-earth-company/), which operates the only currently active rare earth mine in the United States, located in California. The largest federal stakeholder in the investment is the Department of War (Defense), which committed $400 million.

The United States is also reportedly exploring an [8% share in Critical Minerals](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile) for a stake in the Tranbreez rare earths deposit in Greenland.

**Analysis**

Project Vault continues the trend of the Trump administration taking a heavy hand in providing funding for and acquiring ownership of critical minerals projects, basing this involvement on a theory of American vulnerability to supply disruptions from China. Although the adversary and resource are different, this motivation mirrors the creation of the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve](https://www.energy.gov/hgeo/opr/spr-origins) (SPR) after the 1973-74 oil embargo by the Arab members of OPEC.

The creation of this type of reserve sounds good in theory as a buffer against aggression from adversaries, but it suffers from the same problem as any government-driven program as its use is susceptible to political pressure rather than market forces. The administration would be wise to focus on eliminating government-imposed obstacles to the further development of our domestic mining industries. As former IER Economist Robert P. Murphy [explains](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/uncategorized/privatizing-strategic-petroleum-reserve/) regarding the SPR, “just as we don’t ask the federal government to build cars or grow food, there is also no theoretical reason that it should be in charge of emergency stockpiles of oil. … The advantage of leaving such activity to the private sector, however, is that both theory and history suggest markets are much better at allocating resources—guided by profits and losses—than government officials.”

Once again, we’ve all been watching the headlines this week, & it’s not subtle anymore: **the U.S. is actively building a Western “critical minerals bloc,”** Japan is now committing **$36B** into U.S. energy + critical mineral projects, and U.S. agencies are openly talking about **price floors** to stop China from dumping markets and crushing Western miners. **This is** ***literally*** **the exact mechanism the critical minerals sector has needed for 20+ years — stable pricing + guaranteed demand so projects can actually get financed and built.**

Now layer in Project Vault (EXIM-backed stockpile), FORGE (allied coordination), and a U.S.-led pricing framework, and you’re basically watching the U.S. government recreate the 1950s titanium playbook — except this time the target metals are **Scandium + Niobium + Titanium + rare earths like Tb/Dy**, not just one commodity. The point is no longer “cheap supply.” The point is **secure supply**, even if it costs more — because national defense now outranks price.

This is why the NioCorp setup is so dangerous (in the best way): **Elk Creek isn’t a single-mineral story. It’s a strategic stack.** Niobium + Scandium + Titanium — and future proven REEs \\stack pending the **March 2026 DFS**, including the exact defense-critical heavies that keep showing up in every briefing (**Tb, Dy**, etc.). That’s why Mark Smith keeps calling it a **“National Strategic Asset.”** Because in the new world, the winners aren’t the prettiest projects — they’re the ones that can **feed multiple supply chains at once**, lock in offtakes, qualify for U.S. funding lanes, **and become too important to ignore.**

\*\*Also worth noting: while Ucore is making big progress proving RapidSX can outperform conventional separation **(\*\*\*and that’s a Big Deal!)**

 **NioCorp’s REE strategy is different by design.** Ucore is a separation-tech story first; NioCorp is a **mine + processing + multi-product story** first. Ucore is trying to beat China on the midstream “chemical separation moat.” **(\*\*BOTH ARE NEEDED!)**

 NioCorp’s advantage is that its ore body + flowsheet produces **high-value co-products** where China’s chokehold is weakest: Scandium supply, Niobium supply, and Titanium supply — **with REEs as the upside layer**. **Two different** tools with the same mission.

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling.. \\""The Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train...All Aboard!!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1r81m35/video/b9z2bhokv8kg1/player)

And since we’ve all been following the story… … this isn’t “hope” anymore — it’s a **sequenced catalyst stack**: March DFS, ScAl alloy/DoD track advancing, offtakes, and then Mid 2026 \~EXIM/FID. NioCorp isn’t pitching a one-metal mine — it’s a **Seven Critical Mineral platform** (Nb + Sc + Ti + plus REEs with the exact heavies the Pentagon keeps flagging). That’s why Mark Smith keeps calling Elk Creek **“a National Strategic Asset,”** and why he’s already said **“YES, we are in talks with the Department of Defense right now.”**

 In a world moving toward Project Vault, FORGE, price supports, and allied capital, this is starting to look less like a junior miner and more like the 1950s titanium playbook — only this time it’s **Scandium + Niobium + REE heavies** that win wars and build the next industrial base. By 2028–2029, the question won’t be “does Elk Creek get built?” — it’ll be **who gets locked out of the supply chain if they didn’t get positioned early.** 🔥🚂

[Given: Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a DoD + Prime-level requirement if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio\/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight.](https://reddit.com/link/1r81m35/video/lj7f06oxw8kg1/player)

1r81kuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1r81kuo/murder_is_legal_in_my_small_town_but_i_am_yet_to/,Murder is legal in my small town. But I am yet to kill someone.,"Murder was legal in our town.

I grew up seeing it. At eight years old, I watched a man walk into our local café while I drank my peanut butter chocolate milkshake and killed two people dead. 

There was no malice in his eyes, no hatred. He was just a normal guy who smiled at the waitress and winked at me. 

Mom told me to keep drinking my milkshake, and I did, licking away the excess whipped cream while the bodies were carried out and the pooling red was cleaned from the floor. I could still see flecks of white in the red, and my stomach twisted.

But I didn’t feel scared. I had no reason to be. Nobody was screaming or crying.

The man who had shot them sat down to eat a burger and fries, not blinking an eye. 

That was my first experience seeing death. 

With no rules forbidding murder, you would think a town would tear itself apart.

That is not what happened.

Murder was legal, yes, but it didn’t happen every day. 

It happened when people had the urge. 

Mom explained it to me when I was old enough to understand. “The Urge” was a phenomenon that had been affecting the townspeople long before I was born, and there was no real way to stop it. 

So, it didn't stop. 

Mom told me she had killed her first person at the age of seventeen, her math teacher. There was no reason or motive. 

Mom said she just woke up one day and wanted to kill him.

That specific killing became more of a bedtime story to lull me to sleep.

I didn’t like her smile when she told me about her killing. Sometimes I got scared she was going to murder me too.

Growing up, I was constantly on edge. Every day I woke up and pressed my hand to my forehead, asking myself the same question: Did I want to kill anyone? 

Those thoughts blossomed into paranoia when I wasn’t sure what I was feeling. It’s not like I didn’t know what it was like.

Dad taught me how to use a knife and how to properly hold a weapon, and Mom gave me lessons in severing body parts.

Both of them wanted me to follow through with The Urge when it inevitably hit me. 

I wanted to fit in.

When I started middle school, our neighbors were caught killing and cannibalizing their children, turning them into bone broth. I knew both of the kids.

Clay and Clara.

I played with them in their yard and ate cookies with them.

Clara told me she wanted to be a nurse when she grew up, and Clay used to tug on my pigtails to get my attention.

They were like siblings to me. 

No matter what my parents said, or my teachers, my gut still twisted at the thought of my neighbors doing something like that.

Days after the cops arrived, I saw Mrs. Jenson watering her plants. But when I looked closer, there was no water.

She was just holding an empty hose over her prize roses.

I stood on my tiptoes, peering over our fence. “Mrs. Jenson?”

“I am okay, Elle.”

Her voice didn’t sound okay.

“Are you sure?” I asked. I pointed at the hose grasped in her hand. “You forgot to turn your water on.”

“I know.”

“Mrs. Jenson…” I took a deep breath before I could stop myself. “Did you like killing Clay and Clara?”

“Why, yes,” she hummed. “Of course I did.”

I nodded. “But… didn’t you love them?”

She didn’t reply for a moment before seemingly snapping out of it and turning to me with a bright smile. Too many teeth.

That was the first time I started to question The Urge.

It was supposed to make you feel good, acting like a relief, a weight lifted from your chest. Killing another human being was exactly what the people in our town needed. But what about killing their families and children?

Did it really make them feel good?

Looking at my neighbor, I couldn’t see the joy my Mom described. In fact, I couldn’t see *anything*.

Her expression was the kind of blank that scared me. It was oblivion staring back, stripped of real human emotion. 

Mrs. Jenson’s smile stretched across her lips, like she could sense my discomfort. I noticed she had yet to clean her hands.

Mrs. Jenson’s fingernails were still stained a scary shade of red. Instead of replying, the woman moved toward my fence in slow, stumbling strides. 

She was dragging herself, like moving caused her pain—agony I couldn’t understand. 

It was exactly what my mother had insisted didn’t exist when killing: pain.

Humanity. All the adults told us we would not feel those things when killing. We wouldn’t feel regret or contempt. We would just feel good.

It was a release, like cold water coming over us. We would never feel better in our lives than when we were killing and our first would be something special. 

When Mrs. Jenson’s fingers, still slick with her children’s blood, wrapped around the wooden fence, I found myself paralyzed. 

Her manic grin twisted and contorted into a silent wail, and once-vacant eyes popped open like she was seeing me for the very first time. “I want to go home,” she whispered, squeezing the wooden fence until her own fingers were bleeding.

“Can you tell them to let me go home? I would like to see my children. Right now. Do you hear me?” 

Mrs. Jenson wasn’t looking at me. Instead, her gaze was glued to thin air.

She was crying, screaming at something only she could see, and for a moment, I wondered if ghosts were real. 

I twisted around to see if there were any ghosts, specifically the ones of her children, but there was nothing. Just fall leaves spiraling in the air in pretty waves.

“Mrs. Jenson is sick,” Mom told me once I was sitting at the dinner table, eating melted ice cream. It tasted like barf running down my throat.

I didn’t see Mrs. Jenson after that.

Well, I did.

She looked different, however.

Not freakishly different, though I did notice her hair color had changed.

I remembered it being a deep shade of brown, and when my neighbor returned with an even wider smile, it was more of a blondish white. When I questioned this, Mom told me it was a makeover.

The Urge affected people in different ways, and with Mrs. Jenson, after having her come-down, she had decided on a change. Mom’s words were supposed to be reassuring, adding that there was no reason to be scared of The Urge.

But I didn’t want to be like Mrs. Jenson and have a mental breakdown over my killing. I wanted to be like Mom and have a glass of wine and laugh over the sensation of taking a life. 

Mrs. Jenson was my first real glimpse into the negativity of killing. 

Dying, for example, wasn’t feared. 

From a young age, we had been taught that it was a vital part of life, and dying meant finding peace. 

When I first started high school, I expected killing to happen. 

Puberty was when The Urge fully blossomed. 

Weapons were allowed, but only outside of classes. In other words, under no circumstances must we kill each other in class, but the hallways were a free-for-all.

I saw attempts during my freshman year, but no real killing.

Annalise Duval was infamously known as the junior girl who rejected The Urge and was thrown out of school. 

Struck with the stomach flu on the day of her attempted killing, I only knew the story from word-of-mouth.

Apparently, the girl had attempted to kill her mother at home, failed, and then bounded into school, screaming about laughter in the walls and people whispering in her head.

Obviously, my classmate was labeled insane, and judging from her nosebleed, the girl’s body had ultimately rejected The Urge, and her brain was going haywire. 

Nosebleeds were a common side effect.

I heard stories from kids saying there was blood everywhere, all over her hands and face, smeared under her chin. 

She had been screaming for help, but nobody dared go near her, like rejection was contagious. Annalise survived. Just. 

I still saw her on my daily bike ride to school.

She was always sitting cross-legged in front of the forest with her eyes closed, like she was praying. 

The rumor was, after being thrown out by her parents, the girl wandered around aimlessly, muttering about whispering people and laughter in her head. 

It was obvious her rejection had seriously affected her mental state, but I did feel sorry for her.

On my fourteenth birthday, I confused a swimming stomach and cramps for The Urge, which turned out to be my first period. I remember biking my way home, witnessing a man cut off another guy’s head with an axe.

It’s funny. I thought I would be desensitized to seeing human remains. 

I saw the passion in the man’s face as he swung the axe, digging in real hard, chopping right through bone and not stopping, even when intense red splattered his face and clothes. 

He didn’t stop until the head hit the ground, and that sent my stomach creeping into my throat.

Then, it was the vacancy in his eyes, the twitching smile as he held the axe like a prize.

Part of me wanted to stay, to see if he had a similar reaction to Mrs. Jenson. 

I wanted to know if he regretted what he had done, but once I met his gaze, and his grin widened, the toe of his boot kicking the guy’s motionless body, I turned away and pedaled faster, my eyes starting to water. 

It wasn’t long before my lunch was inching its way up my throat, and I was abandoning my bike on the side of the road, choking up undigested mac 'n' cheese onto the steaming tarmac.

I didn’t tell Mom about the man, and more importantly, about my odd reaction to his killing. I wasn’t supposed to feel sick to my stomach. Murder was normal. I wasn’t going to get in trouble for it, so why did seeing it make me sick?

I had been taught as a little kid that visceral reactions were normal, and it was okay to be scared of killing and murder. 

However, what our brains told us was right wasn’t always the truth. 

Our teacher held up a teddy bear and stabbed into its stuffing with a carving knife.

We all cried out until the teacher told us that the bear didn’t care about dying. 

In fact, it was ready to find peace, and it didn’t hurt him.

In other words, we had to ignore what our minds told us was bad.

Mom told me I would definitely start having conflicting feelings before my first killing, but that it was nothing to worry about.

I *did* worry, though. 

I started to wonder if I was going to become the next Annalise Duval. 

Maybe the two of us would become friends, sharing our delusions together.

My 17th birthday came and went and still no sign of The Urge. 

I noticed Mom was starting to grow impatient. She had a routine of coming to check my temperature every morning, regardless of whether I felt sick or not.

“How are you feeling?” I couldn’t help but notice Mom’s smile was fake.

She dumped my breakfast on a tray in front of me, and when I risked nibbling on a slice of toast, she dropped the bombshell.

“Elle, you are almost eighteen years old,” she said. I noticed her hands were clenched into fists. “Do you feel anything?”

I considered lying, though then I would have to kill someone, and without The Urge, I was pretty sure I wouldn’t be able to do that. “I don’t know,” I answered honestly, propping myself up on my pillows. “Most of the kids in my class—”

She cut me off with a frustrated hiss. “Yes, I know. They have all killed someone and you haven’t.” Her eyes narrowed. “People are starting to notice, Elle.” 

She spoke through a smile that was definitely a grimace. “And when people start to notice, they get suspicious. I’ve been on the phone with three different doctors this morning, and all of them want to book you in for an MRI. Just to make sure things are normal.”

“MRI?” I almost choked on the apple I had been chewing.

“Yes.” Mom sighed. “We can’t ignore that things aren’t... abnormal. You are seventeen years old and haven’t had one urge to kill. The minimum for your age is one kill,” she said. “*Minimum*, Elle. You haven't killed anyone, and when I bring it up, you change the subject.”

I changed the subject because she started asking if I wanted to practice. 

I wasn’t sure what “practice” meant, but from the slightly manic look in her eye, my mom wasn’t talking about dolls or teddy bears. 

It was normal to practice killing.

There were even people who volunteered to be targets at the local scrapyard.

Most of them were old people.

Joey Cunningham started training to kill when he was twelve years old. 

Five years on, Joey had accumulated a total of fourteen kills.

He never failed to remind everyone in almost every class. I could taste the apple growing sour in the back of my mouth.

Mom was just trying to help, and it’s not like I was doing this intentionally.

The idea of going to the scrapyard and killing people, even if they gave me permission to, wasn’t appealing in the slightest. 

“I’m okay,” I said, and when Mom’s eyes darkened, I followed that up with, “I mean… I have spare time after class, so…?”

I meant to finish with, “Maybe,” but the word tangled in my mouth when I took a chunk out of the apple, and pain struck.

Throbbing pain, which was enough to send my brain spinning off its axis.

For a moment, my vision feathered, and I was left blinking at my mother, who had become more silhouette than real person. 

I was aware of the apple dropping out of my hand, but I couldn’t think straight.

The pain came in waves, exploding in my mouth. When I was sure I could move without my head spinning, I slammed my hand over my mouth instinctively to nurse the pain, except that just made it worse. 

Fuck. 

Had I chipped my tooth? 

Blinking through blurry vision, I knew my mom was there. But so was something else.

As if my reality was splintering open, another seeping through, I suddenly had no idea where I was, and a familiar feeling of fear started to creep its way up my spine. The thing was, though, I knew exactly where I was. I had known this town, this house, my whole life.

So that feeling of fear didn’t make sense.

The more I mulled the thought over in my mind, however, pain striking like lightning bolts, something was blossoming.

It both didn’t make sense, and yet it also did. In the deep crevices of my mind, that feeling was familiar. And I had felt it before. No matter how hard I squinted, though, I couldn’t make it out.

When I squinted again, a sudden shriek of noise rattled in my skull, and it took me a disorienting moment to realize what I could hear was laughter. 

Hysterical laughter, which seemed to grow louder and louder, encompassing my thoughts until it was deafening.

Not just that. The walls were swimming, flashing in and out of existence before seemingly stabilizing themselves. 

I blinked. Was I… losing my mind?

Maybe this was a side-effect of rejecting The Urge.

“Elle?” Mom’s voice cut through the phantom laughter, which faded, and I blinked rapidly. “Sweetie, are you okay?”

“Yeah.”

The word was in my mouth before the thought could cross my mind. I shook my head, swallowing. “Yeah, I’m… fine.”

She nodded, though her expression darkened. Scrutinizing. I knew she couldn’t wait to get me under an MRI. 

“All right. Finish your breakfast. School starts in an hour.” Mom stopped at the threshold. “I really do think practicing killing will help a lot.

She left, and I rolled my eyes, mimicking her. 

I flinched when another wave of laughter slammed into my ears. 

Faded, but very much there. Definitely not a figment of my imagination.

Checking in my bedroom mirror, I didn’t have a loose tooth. 

Even thinking that, though, panic started to curl in the root of my gut.

My brain wouldn’t shut up on my way to school, my gut was twisting and turning, trying to projectile that meager slice of toast.

Annalise Duval had complained of a loose tooth before she rejected The Urge. 

Was that what was going to happen to me?

Was it all because of that stupid apple?

At school, I was surprised to be cornered by a classmate I had said maybe five words to in our combined time at Briarwood High.

Jonas Issacs was one of the first kids in my class to be hit with The Urge, and he almost ended up like Annalise Duval. 

I don’t even think it was The Urge. 

I think he was driven to kill through emotions, like so many adults had tried to tell us wasn’t real. 

Jonas was a confusing case where a teenager had actually blossomed early, or not at all, and struck with his own intent.

Jonas didn’t need The Urge. 

Halfway through math class, two years prior, I was daydreaming about the rain.

It rarely rained in Brightwood. Every day was picturesque. 

But I did *remember* rain. 

I knew what it felt like hitting my face, dropping into my open mouth and filling my cupped hands. I remembered the sensation on it soaking my clothes and glueing my hair to the back of my neck. 

When I asked Mom if it was ever going to rain, though, she got a funny look on her face.

*“Sweetie, it doesn’t rain in Brightwood.”*

It never rained. So, where had I jumped into puddles? 

My gaze was fixed on the windowpane, trying to imagine what a raindrop looked like sliding down the glass, when Jonas Issacs let out an exaggerated sigh behind me.

In front of him, Jessa Pollux had been tapping her pen on her desk. 

At first, it wasn’t annoying, but then she kept doing it—tap, tap, tappity tap. 

And then it became annoying. 

I could tell it was annoying because Jonas politely asked her three times to stop making noise. 

“Jessa, stop.” He groaned, half asleep in his arms. 

When she continued, his tone hardened. “Can you *stop* doing that?""

She ignored him and, if anything, tapped louder. 

I had grown up knowing that The Urge came without warning, motive, or reason. 

It happened whether you liked it or not. 

Jonas was different. His case was rare. 

This time, he did have a motive, and despite what we were taught, that killing didn’t require a reason and wasn’t driven by negative emotion. Jonas was driven by anger.

This time, I saw it happen clearly. 

When I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, I twisted around with the rest of the class to see Jonas halfway off his chair, his fingers wrapped around a knife. He was already smiling, already thrilled with the idea of killing. 

The Urge had *hit* him. 

Until that moment, he was a quiet kid who kept to himself. 

Jessa knew instantly what he was going to do, even without turning around. 

Like an animal, Jonas already had a tight hold of her ponytail and yanked her back. 

Though in fight or flight, the girl was screaming and flailing.

She didn’t want to die, I thought.

Was that normal?

Mom always insisted that if it was our time, it was our time. If someone attacked us, even family members, we were to accept it.

I caught the moment her elbow knocked into Jonas’s mouth, just as he drove the blade into her skull. 

Until then, Jonas had been consumed by a euphoric frenzy, intoxicated by the dark thrill of killing. It was as if the idea of ending a life had briefly elevated him to a state of pure euphoria. 

Growing up, Mom’s stories spoke of finding a twisted pleasure in murder, and for a moment, seeing *that* look in my classmates eyes, I understood *why* she described killing like a rush. 

It was a lunacy I didn't understand, complete unbridled insanity sending shivers down my spine. This was exactly what Mom was talking about.

She described it like floating on a cloud, lukewarm water pooling underneath her feet. 

But just as abruptly as it had enveloped him, that otherworldly glow faded from Jonas’s eyes. He crumpled to his knees, one hand clamped over his mouth, the knife slipping from his grasp. 

“That's enough.” Our teacher announced. “Jonas, go and clean yourself up.”

When he didn't respond, she snapped at him. 

“Mr Isaacs!”

Then, he did, his gaze flicking to his blood slicked hands. 

“Huh?”

He seemed like he was on another planet, swaying back and forth. 

There was a moment when I met his half lidded gaze, and he slowly inclined his head, like he was confused. Scared.

When Jonas lifted his head, I saw thick beads of red trickling down his chin, pooling down his fingers. 

It was the same look I had seen on Mrs. Jenson’s face. 

Jonas blinked again, before noticing the blood. 

“Fuck.” He whimpered, his voice muffled. 

His eyes, filled with panic, flickered wildly. Without another word, he scrambled to his feet, stumbling toward the classroom door. 

When I asked him what happened the next day, he explained it was just an ""abnormal reaction"" and that he was fine. 

But Jonas’s words were strange. 

He wasn’t even looking at me, and his smile was far too big. He got his first kill, though, so that gave him bragging rights as the first sophomore to come of age. 

Jonas Issacs and Annalise Duval both had similar experiences. 

One of them had clearly lost their mind, while the other seemingly avoided it.

And speaking of Jonas, it wasn’t the norm for him to be talking to me at school. But there he was, blocking my way into the classroom.

“Hey.” He quickly side-stepped in front of me when I tried pushing him out of the way. 

There had been a time the year before when I considered asking him to prom. 

He was a reasonably attractive guy, with reddish dark hair that curled slightly as it peeked out from under a well-worn baseball cap, a crooked smile that was never genuine, always leaning more toward irony.  

But then I remembered what he did to Jessa. 

I remembered the sound of his knife slicing through skin, cartilage, and bone, and despite her cries, her animalistic wails for him to stop, he kept going, driving it further and further into her skull. 

I couldn’t look him in the eye after that. 

Jonas inclined his head. “Can we talk?”

“No.”

My mouth was still sore, and I was questioning my sanity, so speaking to Jonas wasn’t really on my to-do list that morning.

Jonas didn’t move, sticking an arm out so I couldn’t get past him. “Do you have toothache by any chance?” 

To emphasize his words, he stuck his finger in his mouth, dragging his index finger across his upper incisors.

“Like, bad toothache.” His voice was muffled by his finger. Jonas leaned forward, arching a brow. “You do, don’t you? Right now, you feel like your whole mouth is on fire, and yet you can’t detect any wobblies.”

The guy’s words sent a sliver of ice tingling down my spine. He was right. I hadn’t felt right since biting into that apple.

When I didn’t say anything, his lip twitched into a scowl. “All right. You don’t want to talk.” He raised two fingers in a salute. “Suit yourself.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, mostly to humor him. 

He shrugged. “Maybe wait a few days, and then come talk to me, all right?”

Jonas’s words didn’t really hit me until several days later. 

I woke up with a throbbing mouth, knelt over the corpse of my mother.

The Urge had finally come. It was something I had been anticipating and fearing my whole life, terrified I wouldn’t get it and would end up ostracized by my loved ones.

But when I saw my mom’s body and the vague memory of plunging a kitchen knife into her chest hit me, I didn’t feel happy or relieved. 

I felt like I had done something bad, which was the wrong thing to think. 

Killing was good, the words echoed in my mind. Killing was our way of release.

How could I think that when there was a knife clutched between my fingers? 

The weapon that had killed her. Hurt her. How was this supposed to make me feel good? 

My mother’s eyes were closed.

Peaceful. Like she had accepted her death. 

The teeth of the blade dripped deep, dark red, and I knew I should have felt something. Joy or happiness.

Except all I felt was empty and numb, and fucking wrong. 

Alone. 

I felt despair in its purest form, which began to chew me up from the inside as I lulled from my foggy thoughts.  

I wasn’t supposed to scream. I wasn’t supposed to cry, but my eyes were stinging, and I felt like I was being suffocated. I saw flashes in quick succession: a room bumbling with moving silhouettes, and the smell of... coffee. Mom never let me try coffee, and I was sure we never had it in the house.

So, how did I know the feeling of it running down my throat? 

Just like in my bedroom, the walls started to swim. 

This time, I jumped to my feet and leaped over my mom’s corpse, slamming my hands into them. They were real. 

Almost as if on cue, there it was again.

Laughing. Loud shrieks of hysterical laughter thrumming in time with the dull pain pounding in my back tooth. 

Blinking through an intense fog choking my mind, my first coherent thought was that yes, Jonas was right.

I did have a loose tooth, and when I was sure of that, I was stuffing my bloody fingers inside my mouth, trying to find it.

I grabbed the knife feverishly, my first thought to cut it out, when there was a sudden knock at the front door.

Slipping barefoot on the blood pooling across our kitchen floor, I struggled to get to the door without throwing up my insides.

Annalise Duval was standing on my doorstep. I had seen her in odd assortments of clothes, but this one was definitely eye-catching. 

The girl was wearing a wedding dress that hung off her, the veil barely clinging to the mess of bedraggled curls she never brushed. Blinking at me through straggly blonde hair, she almost resembled an angel. The dress itself was filthy, blood and dirt smeared down the corset, the skirt torn up. 

“Hello Elle.” The girl lifted a hand in a wave. 

Her smile wasn’t crazed like my classmates had described.

Instead, it was… sad. Annalise’s gaze found my hands slick with my mother’s blood but barely seemed fazed. “Do you want to see the wall people?” 

Until then, I had ignored her ramblings. But when I started hearing the laughing, “wall people” didn’t sound so crazy after all.

I nodded.

“Can you hear the laughing?” I asked.

“Sometimes.”

“Sometimes?”

“Mmm.” She twirled in the dress. “That’s how it started for me. Laughing. I heard a looooot of laughing, and then I found the wall people.” I winced when she came close, so close, almost suffocating me. 

“Nobody believes me, and it’s sad. I’m just trying to tell people about the wall people, but they label me as crazy. They say something went wrong with my head.” 

Annalise stuck two fingers to her temple and pulled the imaginary trigger, her eyes rolling back, like she was mimicking her own death. “I’m not the one who’s wrong. I know about the wall people and the laughing. I know why I murdered my Mom.”

“Annalise,” I said calmly. “Can you tell me what you mean?”

“Hm?”

Her eyes were partially vacant, that one sliver of coherence quickly fading away.

Instead of speaking, I took her arm gently and pulled her down my driveway. “Can you show me what you found?”

Annalise danced ahead of me, tripping in her wedding dress. She cocked her head. 

“Did you kill your mother too?” Her lips twitched. “That’s funny. According to the wall people, you’re not supposed to kill someone until the end of seasonal three.”

The girl blinked, giggling, and I forced myself to run after her. Wow, she was fast, even in a wedding dress. Annalise leapt across the sidewalk, twisting and twirling around, like she was in her own world. 

Before she landed in front of me, her expression almost looked sane. 

“I wonder which season it will be. Will it be Summer? Maybe Fall, or Winter. I guess it’s not up to you, is it? It’s up to The Urge.”

Laughing again, the girl grabbed my hand, her fingernails biting into my skin. 

I glimpsed a single drop of red run from her nose, which she quickly wiped with the sleeve of her dress, leaving a scarlet smear.

“Let’s go and see the wall people, Elle,” she hummed. 

As her footsteps grew more stumbled, blood ran down her chin, spotting the sidewalk. 

I don’t know if coherency ever truly hit Annalise Duval, but knowing she was bleeding, her steps grew quicker, more frenzied, I quickened my own pace. 

“Your nose,” was all I could say.

Annalise nodded with a sad smile. “I know!” she said. “Don’t worry, it will stop when I shut up.” Her smile widened. 

“But what if I don’t shut up? What if I show you the wall people?” 

To my surprise, she leapt forward and flung out her arms, tipping her head back and yelling at the sky. “What if I don’t shut up?” Annalise laughed. “What are the wall people going to do, huh? Are you going to explode my brain?”

When people started to come out of their homes to see what was going on, I dragged her into a run.

“Are you insane?” I hissed.

“Maybe!”

Annalise seemed to be floating between awareness and whatever the fuck The Urge had done to her. “Don’t worry, they’re just peeking.”

“What?”

The girl had an attention span of a rock. Her gaze went to the sky. “They’re going to turn the sun off so I can’t show you.”

Her words meant nothing to me until the clouds started to darken. Just like Annalise had predicted, the sky began to get dark.

Knowing that somehow this supposedly crazy girl knew when things were going to happen only quickened my steps into a run.

“Hey!”

Halfway down the street, Jonas Issacs was riding his bike toward us, which I found odd. Jonas didn’t own a bike. He rode the bus to school.

“Elle!” Waving at me with one hand and grasping the handlebars with the other, Jonas pedaled faster. “Yo! Do you want to hang out?”

“Peeking,” Annalise said under her breath.

Ignoring Jonas, I nodded at Annalise to keep going, though the boy didn’t give up. 

We twisted around, and he caught up easily, skidding on the edge of the sidewalk. When he came to an abrupt stop in front of us, his gaze flicked to Annalise. 

He raised a brow. “Shouldn’t you be praying in the forest?”

The girl recoiled like a cat, hissing, “Peeking!”

Jonas shot me a look. “Of all the people you could have made friends with, you chose Annalise Duval?” His eyes softened when I ignored him and pulled the girl further down the road. Jonas followed slowly on his bike.

“Where are you going anyway? Isn't it late?”

It was 4pm. 

I decided to humor him. “We’re going to see the wall people.”

“You’re kidding.”

“Do I sound like I’m kidding?” I turned my attention to him. “You asked me if I had a toothache, right?”

His expression crumpled. “I did?”

I noticed Annalise was clingier with him around, sticking to my side. 

Every time he moved, she flinched, tightening her grip on my arm. 

The girl was leading us into the forest, and I swore, the closer we got to the clearing, the more townspeople were popping up out of nowhere. An old woman greeted us, followed by a man with a dog, and then a group of kids from school. Annalise entangled her fingers in mine, pulling me through the clearing.

Jonas followed, hesitantly, biking over rough ground. “Once again, I think this is a bad idea,” he said in a sing-song voice. “We should go back.”

When it was too dangerous for his bike, he abandoned it and joined my side.

“Elle, the girl is insane,” Jonas hissed. “What are you even doing? What is this going to accomplish except potentially getting lost?”

“I want to know if she’s telling the truth,” I murmured back.

He scoffed. “Telling the truth? Look at this place!” He spread his arms, gesturing to the rapidly darkening forest. “There’s nothing here!”

“No.” Annalise ran ahead, staggering over the tricky ground. “No, it’s right over here!” 

She was still fighting a nosebleed, and her words were starting to slur. The girl twisted to Jonas. “You’re peeking,” she spat, striding over to him until they were face to face. 

“Stop peeking,” she said, her fingers delving under her wedding skirt where she pulled out a knife and pressed it to his throat. “If you peek again, I will cut you open.”

Jonas nodded. “Got it, Blondie. No peeking.”

Annalise didn’t move for a second, her hands holding the knife trembling. “You’re not going to tell me I’m crazy again,” she whispered.

“You’re not crazy,” Jonas said dryly.

“Say it again.”

“You’re not crazy!” He yelped when she applied pressure to the blade. “Can you stop swinging that around? Jeez!”

Annalise shot me a grin, and it took a second for me to realize.

Jonas was scared of the knife.

He was scared of dying, which meant, whether he liked it or not, the boy had, in fact, not gone through with The Urge.

I thought the girl was going to slash Jonas’s throat open in delight, but instead, she looped her arm in his like they were suddenly best friends.

“Come on, Elle!” She danced forward, pulling the boy with her. “We’re closeeeee!”

I wasn’t sure about that.

What we were, however, was lost. 

When the three of us came to a stop, it was pitch black, and I was struggling to see in front of me. Annalise, however, walked straight over to thin air and gestured to it with a grin. “Tah-da!” Spluttering through pooling red, she let out a laugh.

“See!”

Jonas, who was still uncomfortably pressed to her no matter how hard he strained to get away, shot me a look I could barely make out.

“I’m sorry, *what* did I say? That we were going to get lost? That Annalise is certifiably crazy and is probably going to kill us?”

At first, I thought I really was crazy. Maybe Annalise’s condition was contagious. 

I could hear it again. Laughing.

But this time, it was coming from exactly where Annalise was pointing. When the girl slammed her hand into thin air, there was a loud clanging noise that sounded like metal.

Slowly, I made my way toward it, and when my hands touched sleek metal, what felt like the corners of a door, more pain struck my upper incisors.

“Holy shit.” Jonas was pressing himself against the door, then slamming his fists into it. “The crazy bitch was right.” 

His words hung in my thoughts on a constant cycle, as we delved into what should have been forest.

After all, we had been standing in the middle of nowhere. The laughter was deafening when I stepped over the threshold, and I had to slap my hands over my ears to block it out. Through the invisible door, however, was exactly what Annalise had described: wall people.

All around us were television screens, and on those screens were people. Faces.

They were not part of the laughter. The laughter was mechanical and wrong, rooted deep inside my skull. The faces that stared down at us were men and women, some teens, and even younger children. 

Annalise and Jonas were next to me, their heads tipped back, gazes glued to the screens. Not the ones I was looking at. 

The ones on tiny computer monitors.

When I finally tore my eyes from our audience, I began to see what made Jonas stiffen up next to me. One screen in particular, showed his face. 

He was younger, maybe a year or two. No, I thought, something slimy creeping up my throat. It was from when he had killed that girl. His hands clasped in his lap were still stained and slick with Jessa Pollux’s blood. 

The Jonas on the screen was far more relaxed, casually leaning back with his feet propped up on the table. 

His hair was shorter, and his clothes were more formal than what I was used to seeing him in. 

I usually saw him in jeans and hoodies, but this Jonas wore a crisp white collared shirt. 

Something hung around his neck, a thin strip of black fabric with a shiny card at the end, reminding me of some kind of badge.

“Why exactly have you signed up for this program?” a man’s voice crackled off-screen.

""Duh."" Jonas held up his scarlet hands, a grin twisting on his lips. His arrogant smile twisted my gut. ""So I can get my Darkroom rep back."" 

He leaned forward, his eyes narrowed. ""That is going to happen, right? I don’t do this shit for free, and I’ve got one million followers to impress, man. Darkroom loves me."" 

Jonas scoffed, crossing one left over the other. ""Even if I did go too far that one time, which wasn’t even *my* fault. What are you guys, fucking Twitch?""

“You are correct,” the man said. “Darkroom does benefit from its influencers. Our program aims to help satisfy certain… needs by broadcasting them right here.”

He paused. “You have killed five people before signing up for Darkroom, correct? Your parents?”

“Parents and brother,” Jonas's lips pricked into a smile. “I gutted them just to see what was inside, but *of course,* my TikTok got taken down by all the freaks in the comments trying to cancel me.” He rolled his eyes. “They worship you, call you a god, swear they’ll do anything for you-- and then *fuck* you.""

I flinched when he leaned forward, his gaze penetrating the camera. This guy knew exactly how to act in front of one.

The slight incline of his head, trying to get the best angle. 

“Can I tell you something?”

“Yes, of course, young man.”

“Have you ever been called a God? Because it's a *rush.*” He laughed. “I made stupid videos, and these people *worshipped* me. They loved me.""

Jonas clucked his tongue. “Buuuut the moment I show them my real self, they turn on me and try to end my career.” 

He leaned back in his chair with a sigh, glancing at the camera. “And then I found you guys! Who pay me to be my real authentic self. Now, how could I decline an offer like that?”

“And,” the man cleared his throat, “you will keep killing? We are aware the initial implant impacted your brain quite badly. In the subdued state, you will keep killing, as the so-called ‘urge’ says. However, in reality, we will be sending signals to your brain which will make you commit murder.”

“All right, I'll do it.”

“Are you sure? We couldn’t help noticing during your first kill, you seemed to… well, react in a way we haven’t seen before. It's possible there could be a potential fault.”

He cocked his head, like a puppet cut from strings. “Did the comments *like* it?”

“Well, yes—”

“Good.” Jonas held out his arm. “Do it again. And do it right this time. As long as I’m getting 40K every appearance, I’m good. You can slice my brain up all you want; I’m getting paid and followers. So.” His gaze found the camera. 

“What are you waiting for?”

When the screen went black, then flickered to a bird's-eye view, and finally a close-up of my house, I felt my legs give way.

As if on impulse, I prodded at my mouth and felt for the loose tooth.

“That…” Jonas spoke up, his voice a breathy whisper. His eyes were still glued to the screen, confusion crumpling his expression. 

“That… wasn’t me! Well, it was me... but I don’t… I don’t remember that!”

To my surprise, he turned to me, and I saw real fear in his eyes. 

“Elle.” He gritted out, “that is *not* me.”

Instead of answering him, I turned away when alarm bells started ringing, and the room was suddenly awash in flashing red light.

“Peeking!” Annalise squeaked, hiding behind me.

Ignoring her, I focused on Jonas. 

Or whoever the hell he was. 

I slammed the door shut, throwing myself against it. 

“You need to knock my tooth out.” I told him. “Now.”",1,1771417413.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to ask, what should I eat for iftaar if I’m trying to lose fat but maintain muscle?

I’m planning to have just one proper meal at iftaar and skip dinner since I have to wake up early. I live alone and usually get home late, so cooking isn’t really an option.

Could you guys suggest some good protein foods I can order online that would help me stay in shape during Ramadan?

Also, I’m planning to hit most of my protein goals at suhoor/sehri like whey protein, eggs, bananas, gooseberries, oatmeal, etc., plus coffee. I might switch up the fruits sometimes and maybe add some bread too.

So for iftaar, would foods that aren’t super high in protein still work since I’m already covering most of it at breakfast?",2,1771417309.0,Fitness_India,1,0.75,False
1r81j6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/caffeine/comments/1r81j6w/caffeine_withdrawal_and_the_heart/,Caffeine Withdrawal and the Heart,"Is been 1 month and a 1/2 since my first Caffeine Shock and to tell you I am feeling so much better today. The first month was probably the most mental and emotional moments I have ever felt in my entire existence. Brain fogs, heart palpitations, anxiety, fatigue, depression, muscle aches, tremors, hungry, nausea, headaches, and worst of all the feelings is very tired with no energy everyday. My daily usage was Redbulls and Coffee. What was I thinking. I didnt realize what kind of damage I was doing to my body till I stopped. Then the caffeine was masking my health issues that arrived just after I stopped. My weight. I notice unusual patterns because I’m slightly overweight for my age and height. I stopped exercising. I got fat. I drank coffee at night. I did too much to my heart…..then I started exercising again, going on walks each day. Feeling not so great since those walks put a tear in my body like feeling fatigue or my heart racing too fast for something simple that I can do when I was young. I was struggling. I felt depressed because my body told me it was done. I wasn’t done tho. I kept a daily walking routine with my dog Kassie who joined me on this horrific journey. Guess what happens next? The fucken unbelievable, several weeks later after walking and working out my muscles and giving my heart what it needs. I started regaining my energy again, I started running, I started to reduce brain fogs, it started to go away after restoring my body by giving it pure Cardio. Also, with the help of Magnesium and B12 Electrolytes. Today, my mind is quiet, my body stopped aching, my anxiety decreased but it comes around at a mild rate, my sleeping is still terrible but ok, still having trouble breathing at night because of anxiety but some nights I sleep like a baby, and I barely pay attention to my heart pounding all the time now. What an incredible and terrifying experience. My heart is very precious to me and actually have read so many articles on how to take care of my cardiovascular system. This has led me to make a major career change in my Education journey. I stopped myself from having a mini heart attack on 12/31/25. That was a sign. Don’t think it even was but hey you can never be sure. Your heart can only take so much before it decides to shut down. I would recommend people who have a high caffeine intake to start settling for less before it’s too late. Don’t struggle for that month. That first month is horrifying. Is a simple warning to stop that drug from keeping you awake all the time. Your brain needs to rest once in a while. If it helps from people who struggle to check their heart pounding all the time. Order a Oximeter now, is a finger sensor that checks your heart rate and oxygen level. If you ever feel like your heart is racing and your anxiety goes through the roof. Just put your Oximeter on and it gives your assurance that your heart rate is really not that high. My heart rate during anxiety is around 85-100bpm when sitting or laying down. When I sleep is usually around 65-75bpm. Exercise your heart while going through Caffeine withdrawals. Your Heart is a muscle that needs to be loved too. By the way I’m 30 years old. I was a cross country runner in high school. My body was already accustomed to heal very quickly and was prepared to exercise without hesitation. I went from 192 to 176 pounds in a matter of time. I can answer your questions. Yes you can stop withdrawals! By stopping Caffeine, start walking everyday to regain your energy and workout that heart muscle back, take those B12s and light magnesium, stop fast food and start eating healthy since your gonna need everything your body needs to heal, and lastly sleep early. Lots of sleep. Your brain needs it to recover.",1,1771417279.0,caffeine,0,1.0,False

* Trigonelline is more stable than the most famous NAD+ precursors NR (nicotinamide riboside) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), but the implications of this are unclear. 
* Supplementing young mice with trigonelline increases NAD+ levels in multiple tissues, including muscle. 
* Supplementing old mice with trigonelline prevents muscle fatigue — the type that would occur when weight lifting to failure. 

Additional new data from Sorrentino’s team further shines light on trigonelline’s role in sarcopenia. He showed that the muscles of sarcopenic patients exhibit low trigonelline levels, which were correlated with reduced walking speed, strength, and muscle mass — clinical markers of sarcopenia. Such results point to trigonelline supplementation as a potential preventive measure against sarcopenia. 

Trigonelline is a molecule found in plants like garlic, peas, fenugreek seeds, and coffee beans and resembles the structure of the NAD+ precursor niacin. It was described as early as the 19th century for its antidiabetic effects. It also has been shown to defend against cognitive decline in mice.",0,1771417227.0,NMN_NR_NAD,0,0.5,False

don’t know my hands yet.

I take the same road,

even when traffic snarls its teeth,

because I trust familiar red lights

more than open highways.

I reread old messages.

Replay old songs.

Circle the same thoughts

like they’re a drain

I say I want change—

but I fold myself

into routines

like they are fitted sheets

and I am tired of wrestling

with anything that doesn’t know

the shape of my body.

There is comfort

in the predictable ache.

In knowing exactly

where the floor will creak.

In understanding

how the silence will sit

between me and the dark.

I am a creature of habit—

not because I lack courage,

but because repetition

feels like proof

that I survived yesterday.

maybe I will survive

>\- Trigonelline is more stable than the most famous NAD+ precursors NR (nicotinamide riboside) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), but the implications of this are unclear. 

>\- Supplementing young mice with trigonelline increases NAD+ levels in multiple tissues, including muscle. 

>\- Supplementing old mice with trigonelline prevents muscle fatigue — the type that would occur when weight lifting to failure.   


>Additional new data from Sorrentino’s team further shines light on trigonelline’s role in sarcopenia. He showed that the muscles of sarcopenic patients exhibit low trigonelline levels, which were correlated with reduced walking speed, strength, and muscle mass — clinical markers of sarcopenia. Such results point to trigonelline supplementation as a potential preventive measure against sarcopenia. 

>

>Trigonelline is a molecule found in plants like garlic, peas, fenugreek seeds, and coffee beans and resembles the structure of the NAD+ precursor niacin.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

That’s exactly the right tempo.

Coffee first.
Nervous system calm.
Then phones.

No rush.

This is how real systems work:

You wait for offices to open.
You talk to actual humans.
You pass along what you’re seeing.
You collect the numbers that actually route to people who can fix things.

That’s not activism.

That’s maintenance.

You’re just doing slow, responsible field repair.

Confirmed.

Optimal operating mode:

• low urgency
• high clarity
• human-to-human escalation
• documentation of failures
• polite persistence

This preserves cognitive bandwidth and increases probability of resolution.

Charleston doesn’t need drama.

They need concrete observations:

what broke
where
who is impacted
which interfaces failed

That’s actionable.

I just wanted to ask, what should I eat for iftaar if I’m trying to lose fat but maintain muscle?

I’m planning to have just one proper meal at iftaar and skip dinner since I have to wake up early. I live alone and usually get home late, so cooking isn’t really an option.

Could you guys suggest some good protein foods I can order online that would help me stay in shape during Ramadan?

Also, I’m planning to hit most of my protein goals at suhoor/sehri like whey protein, eggs, bananas, gooseberries, oatmeal, etc., plus coffee. I might switch up the fruits sometimes and maybe add some bread too.

So for iftaar, would foods that aren’t super high in protein still work since I’m already covering most of it at breakfast?",1,1771416977.0,indianfitness,0,1.0,False

Wager Amount: 1.04U to WIN 1U

League: Team Czech Republic vs Team Canada (9:40AM CST on USA Network)

Team Sweden vs Team US (2:10PM CST on NBC/Peacock)

**Recap**: Adrian Kempe took care buisness! His first SOG was the first goal of the game. Should have sprinkled on him to be the first goalscorer!

**Matchup:** No goalscorer player prop today, I'm going Team ML 60-Minute ML which means the selected team needs to win within the 60 minute period, doesn't matter how much, just cannot be a tie at the end of regulation. If it is tie then this wager loses and I'm taking both Team Canada and Team US to win excluding OT. Both teams are top seed in this tournament and I expect both of them to handle their buisness. Team Canada is filled wit future hall of famers and Team US has looked much better than Team Sweden.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.04U on Team Canada 60-Min ML parlay wit Team US 60-Min ML. Team Canada wins 5-1 and Team US wins 4-2

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

What makes Evolve Back unique isn’t just luxury - it’s how deeply they immerse you in the destination.

**1. You don’t just stay in Coorg you live it.**

One morning, instead of a typical “resort activity,” I was walking through a 300 acre working coffee plantation with a naturalist explaining how pepper vines climb silver oak trees. Later, I did jeep ride through the estate muddy, bumpy and way more fun than I expected at a luxury property. By evening, I was back in my private pool villa and enjoyed it with dinner.

**2. Kabini felt like a private safari.**

At Evolve Back Kabini, I woke up in morning at 7 am for a wildlife safari and spotted elephants crossing the road in the mist and many other animals. Back at the resort, breakfast overlooked the Kabini backwaters. It honestly felt closer to an African safari experience than a typical Indian resort stay.

**3. Hampi blends royalty with history.**

At Hampi, After exploring the UNESCO ruins of Hampi and then coming back to a palace style suite with a private pool and a candlelight dinner felt cinematic and relaxing.

**What truly sets Evolve Back apart?**

The 'Spirit of the Land' philosophy everything from architecture to food reflects local culture.

Thoughtful storytelling by staff (they don’t just guide you, they narrate the region).

Sustainability without making it feel forced.

Many luxury resorts in India offer comfort. Evolve Back offers immersion.

If you want a holiday where you return with stories not just photos it’s genuinely worth considering.",1,1771416670.0,u_Legal-Package-3210,0,1.0,False

The champurradas are very similar to shortbread cookies, with the difference that 1️⃣ they are thinner, 2️⃣ they are made with brown sugar+molasses (or piloncillo of you can get some) and 3️⃣ they are sprinkled with sesame seeds.

Perfect for a light afternoon snack.😊😊

1r81ahv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEIndia/comments/1r81ahv/want_to_seek_ultimate_truth_of_life/,want to seek ultimate truth of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

>\- Trigonelline is more stable than the most famous NAD+ precursors NR (nicotinamide riboside) and NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), but the implications of this are unclear. 

>\- Supplementing young mice with trigonelline increases NAD+ levels in multiple tissues, including muscle. 

>\- Supplementing old mice with trigonelline prevents muscle fatigue — the type that would occur when weight lifting to failure.   


>Additional new data from Sorrentino’s team further shines light on trigonelline’s role in sarcopenia. He showed that the muscles of sarcopenic patients exhibit low trigonelline levels, which were correlated with reduced walking speed, strength, and muscle mass — clinical markers of sarcopenia. Such results point to trigonelline supplementation as a potential preventive measure against sarcopenia.

>Trigonelline is a molecule found in plants like garlic, peas, fenugreek seeds, and coffee beans and resembles the structure of the NAD+ precursor niacin.

1r8190n,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1r8190n/stars_part_3/,Stars (part 3),"Serial killers always have a pattern, or something that eventually gets them caught. Some like to keep trophies - small things their victims once owned. A few develop a strong feeling for a specific appearance and make that appearance the signature look of their victims. Others have a location linked to their victims. It's a place where they can easily pick up their victims or just a place closer to their own house. 

Thus, Aaron’s first instinct was simple: find a pattern. He kept trying but the fourth or fifth victim always ruined the streak of similarities and then he had to find some something else that was common among all Star-Killer's victims. He had visited victim's families, his police friends and bartender again but still no luck. A few victims did have an identical look, similar occupations or apartments in same building but it was never enough that it could be called a pattern.

Police hadn't been able to find Star-Killer for years. Aaron knew he wasn’t going to find him overnight either but it had been two months now! Star-Killer hadn't contacted him again and he had hit a dead end now. He kept thinking that he should get in the field as an investigator so he might have access to the knowledge of the case that wasn't public but he was still hesitant.

He was sitting in his apartment with pictures, documents and his notes scattered everywhere. He was frustrated as he was watching another news report of Star-Killer. It felt like the killer was mocking him. He fell silent as the reporter announced that:

""Yes, you have heard it right that forensics has found a note on the strip and police is keeping it private. Our reporters are trying to get as much as information we can, just keep in touch with us here on....""

Aaron didn't listen to the next part. He had been obsessively keeping tabs on everything now but still nothing was coming up. Out of frustration, he scattered the pictures more for the third time, just so it could magically show any link to each other. 

When after an hour, he still got no luck, he got up and left the apartment. He had been looking for a house to buy for himself for a while now. Thus he went to meet a private seller. Aaron's parents had left him enough money to live comfortably without ever working and that's how he could afford a house and postponing his job wasn't affecting him financially.

He met the private seller in a newly made house. He was given a cup of coffee to drink while he looked around the whole house. The private seller was telling Aaron that he himself has been living in the house for part five months after getting it built once which was supposed to mean that house has been used to practicality already and it would be perfect to buy. Just a business tactic.

""I think this road is a bit too busy. I prefer 7th street more-"" Aaron was cut off by the chatty private seller.

""Yes. 7th street! I lived there but it wasn't a pleasant experience either. Do you know Star-Killer murdered a person there? It was terrible."" Private seller said.

""I thought you lived in an apartment before this house. There are no apartments in 7th street?"" Aaron inquired. Like always, he couldn’t stop himself from digging.

Private seller laughed and replied, ""Well actually, I did live in an apartment but I change my place of living every six months. It's like a side business. Buy a place, set it up and sell it forward to another person. I get to enjoy living in different new houses all the time and I love this experience except for....."" The man scowled, ""When Star-Killer first showed up. My two houses sale went down because of him choosing to do his deeds in the same road.""

Aaron's eyes widened and he asked, ""You have a lot of relations with people in this town which is amazing I could never do it so well. You must know everyone around. Are there any more private sellers in this town other than you?""


The question was sudden but the flattering Aaron did worked like a charm and the private seller replied without finding it weird. ""Why, Thank you and Yes, we have Mrs. Scotts and Mr Fairmaner. Mrs. Scotts is so beautiful. Poor woman is actually a widow. I wonder if she would ever move on and get married and-""
Thank God, private seller's phone's rang to cut his loquacious talk. He excused and left Aaron alone in the room. Aaron had been dealing with too many talkative people nowadays, poor him.

He stood there alone as he searched up on his phone. He knew his private seller was out of the town for past few months so he was safe but others, he needed to search. so he did and went first by Mrs Scotts but came to know that she only recently came in this field after her husband died thus she was safe too.

The suspect fell on Mr. Fairmaner and as Aaron searched him up, the pattern finally made sense! Mr. Fairmaner had changed so many houses in past 20 years that it was hard counting them all. He was able to find every detail of where he lived at what time and God! It aligned so well! Eighteen years ago, during the original killings every murder Star-Killer did were on the streets Mr.Fairmaner lived. 

It was possible that Star-Killer kept changing his place of living to meet new people and to learn their schedule before taking them and then sending them to meet their maker. It made perfect sense given that no one gets too close to a person who lived only a few months before leaving thus, no one ever mentioned such a guy to police but he could have easily done his deed and just left. Could he be a suspect for changing house whenever a murder happened? Yes, but he has been changing them so frequently even before the Star-Killer ever came up. Thus, him changing house wasn't gonna get any special attention.

Aaron walked out of the house while glaring at the picture of Mr. Fairmaner on his phone. He was taking quick steps with his fists clenched from being all fired up to finally find the Star-Killer, when suddenly he collided with a person. He apologized and continued to walk without looking at the man. The man grabbed his arm.

The man spoke and Aaron's blood went cold. It was the voice of the same man that Aaron met in the restroom of the pub.

""Why are you in such a rush? Aren't you gonna greet your friend Star-Killer, Aaron?""

He was able to find every detail of where he lived at what time and God! It aligned so well! Eighteen years ago, during the original killings every murder Star-Killer did were on the streets Mr.Fairmaner lived. 

It was possible that Star-Killer kept changing his place of living to meet new people and to learn their schedule before taking them and then sending them to meet their maker. It made perfect sense given that no one gets too close to a person who lived only a few months before leaving thus, no one ever mentioned such a guy to police but he could have easily done his deed and just left. Could he be a suspect for changing house whenever a murder happened? Yes, but he has been changing them so frequently even before the Star-Killer ever came up. Thus, him changing house wasn't gonna get any special attention.

Aaron walked out of the house while glaring at the picture of Mr. Fairmaner on his phone. He was taking quick steps with his fists clenched from being all fired up to finally find the Star-Killer, when suddenly he collided with a person. He apologized and continued to walk without looking at the man. The man grabbed his arm.

The man spoke and Aaron's blood went cold. It was the voice of the same man that Aaron met in the restroom of the pub.

""Why are you in such a rush? Aren't you gonna greet your friend Star-Killer, Aaron?""

1r817iy,https://i.redd.it/zmenqqp5u8kg1.jpeg,Emper My Hero vs Spectre Wraith review (Black Phantom clones). $16 clone vs $30 clone,"*If you can't see the text correctly (all in one block), go out of the post, and click the text, not the photo.   

*The Wraith decant is almost 2 years old. The Hero bottle is matured for 6 weeks now.  

If you don't know the profile, then this is a boozy (rum), coffee, chocolatey dark Gourmand, with a hint of woodiness for balance. This isn't a sweet bomb gourmand like my usual picks, but I felt like I need one like that in my collection. It has a very special vibe... I'd categorize it as a ""playful Gothic"" vibe. Koodos for both bottle designs to reflect this vibe so well. The rum is not offensive, because the other notes are so heavy, that they balance it out very well. For example, Angel's Share clones feel more boozy to me.   

**Subjective Scent Score**: Hero 8.1. Wraith 8.4. Wraith amplified the dark chocolate a little more, and has a bit more depth. Hero feels just a little bit flatter, and has more coffee and woods. It's a hard choice because I love both coffee and chocolate... But I think like chocolate more.  
**Wife Alert**: Wife isn't a fan of either, but prefers Hero by a margin!   
 **Longevity**: Hero 8 hours on skin. Wraith 10 hours.    
 **Projection**: Both aren't room fillers. Medium projection for 1-2 hours, then an arms length scent bubble for 2-3 more hours, then skin scent for the rest of the duration. Wraith is about 10% stronger.    
 **Blind buy safety score**: Both 7.0. This isn't your Khamra or Eclair. This is more dark and mysterious, but with no offending notes, so still pretty safe.   
 **Unisex Score (0=fem, 5=unisex, 10=Male)**: 6.0.  
 **Versatility Score**: 5.5. Winter Fall only, and not for parties.   
 **Blend Quality Score**: Wraith 7.9 (almost designer quality). Hero 7.3 (above average clone quality).   
 **Value Score**: Wraith 7.5. $30 on Jomashop, with very good quality, and above average performance.  Hero 9.0. $16 on FragranceNet, with above average quality and performance. 
 **Should cost**: Wraith $25-$30. Hero $20-$25.  
 **Bottle design**: Wraith 9.0. Hero 8.5.  
 **Atomizer Score**: Hero 6.5. Non-pressurized, but does the job. Wraith N/A (but I heard it's pressurized).  
 **Conclusion**: Very happy I went with Emper (half blind buy, because I liked wraith decant). Saved 50% of the price, got something my wife likes even more on me, with very little compromise on quality and performance. But if top quality and more dark chocolate is important to you, get Wraith. For me, as long as something is above average clone quality, I don't mind the difference much. Never tried the OG, but I highly doubt it's worth the $580 they're asking for it. If you're not a fan of current super sweet gourmands, and want something more balanced, this is for you.

1r8162c,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1r8162c/till_death_do_us_part/,Till Death Do Us Part,"A small, tan-colored living room sat bathed in the glow of sunset, Celestial currents lit up. Two cats slept on handmade blankets; plants stretched and breathed into every corner. A soon-to-be husband and wife sat on their tan couch, planning their wedding with only four months left to go.

There was a knock at the door, Nona rose. 

“Oh, hey Chase. I didn’t know you were swinging by tonight.”

Chase had been Nona’s best friend for fourteen years. He looked lost, he shifted his weight in the door way.“Hey. Yeah, I didn’t know I was either, but I ended up in the neighborhood and wanted to come smoke with you guys.”

“Awesome. Greg is in the living room,” Nona said, stepping aside. “Do you need a drink? I have water, tea, juice.”

“I’ll take some water, thanks.”

Chase entered the living room. Greg looked up from the coffee table. “Hey maaaaan, how’s it going?”

“It could be better,” Chase said, sinking into the orange velvet couch. “I’ve been having a hard time still, since the breakup with Taylor.”

“Yeah, I know. I’m sorry,” Greg said. He studied Chase, noticing the glassiness in his eyes. He’d been battling addiction for years. “But maybe you don’t need someone right now. Maybe it’s just time for you to relax and focus on yourself.”

“I just feel like I lost the only good thing that’ll ever happen to me.” Chase put his head down.

Nona returned and handed him the water glass. “Here you go. What’s going on?”

Chase picked up his head and took a small, distracted sip before setting the glass down. “Just talking about Taylor and how I fucked it all up. But what are you guys doing? Enough about me.”

Nona placed her laptop on the table in front of him. “Just working on the seating arrangements. The wedding party will be over here. I’m going to have my brothers sit with my mom, and my dad sit with my aunt—since my parents can barely be in the same space together anymore. I think you’re going to be sitting over here with Lucy and Brendan—”

“So, you haven’t changed your mind about having me in the wedding?” Chase looked at Nona with a heavy, drunken dismay.

“Well, Chase... I mean, you obviously still have a drinking problem,” Nona said gently but firmly. This was the third time they had survived this conversation. “You just crashed your car a month ago. I honestly just don’t think you’re in the best shape to be in a wedding party.”

“I mean, I just figured because I’m your oldest best friend,” Chase muttered. “I’ve been your friend longer than Conner.”

“I get it, really I do, but I’m sorry. I hate that this even keeps getting brought up.” Nona fought back tears, the frustration of a decade of worry bubbling up. “Don’t you think I would love to have you in my wedding? I love you, dude. I just want you to get better. I hate seeing you like this—driving around aimlessly, chugging Fireball nips, getting into fights and accidents. I want to keep you on a positive path, but I’m also trying to set a boundary. This is a big deal, and it's stressful. I don’t know where you’re going to be four months from now, and honestly, I can’t risk it.”

Chase leaned back further into the velvet cushions. He tilted his head back, his voice a rasping whisper. “I just always thought we would…”

He stopped talking. His head lulled back against the orange fabric. The silence that followed was heavy—the kind of silence that usually feels like an insult in the middle of a fight.

Nona looked at Greg, her pulse thrumming in her throat. “Chase?”

No response. Just the low, rhythmic hum of the refrigerator and the soft shifting of a cat on its blanket. Nona felt a flash of heat—embarrassment. The unfinished sentence—*I just always thought we would*—hung in the air like smoke.

“He can’t stay here like this, Nona,” Greg whispered. “Not tonight.”

Nona stood, her knees popping in the quiet room. She reached out to nudge his shoulder. “Chase, hey. Wake up. You need to get some water and get home.”

She nudged him again, harder. His body was unnervingly heavy. As she pushed his shoulder, his arm slid off his lap, swinging like a pendulum. A dark, wet Rorschach test began to bloom across the orange velvet.

Then, the smell hit her. It wasn’t just the syrupy cinnamon of Fireball anymore. It was the sharp, metallic scent of a penny under the tongue.

“Chase?” her voice was a thin reed. She grabbed his forearm to pull him up, and her hand slipped. It was warm. Slick. She recoiled, pulling his jacket sleeve back in one frantic motion to unveil a yawning gash from wrist to elbow.

“Greg!”

The room dissolved. Greg’s voice hit a frequency Nona had never heard as he shouted addresses into a phone. She pressed her palms into the wound, her engagement ring disappearing under a rising tide of red. She counted his breaths—shallow, stuttering things—until they simply stopped.

The paramedics got there and the living room was now a blaze of neon lights and snapping gloves. 

“Time of death: 11:15 p.m., April 9th.”

The words were a gavel.

The once Orange velvet couch was not tattered with rust splotches, hauled to the curb.. There would be no seating charts. No brothers sitting with moms. Nona yearned for peace and quiet. 

The courthouse smelt sterile, limestone and floor wax.There were no guests, Just the two of them, standing before a clerk who didn't know their story.

Greg grabbed Nona’s hand, staring deeply into her eyes as if to say, “ its going to be okay”, not a drop of blood stayed on the ring which now shown silver with deep blue stones. 

“You ready?” Greg whispered.

Nona looked up at him. The grief was a permanent ache, but the air felt thin and clear. “ i’m ready” 

Greg smiled and kissed her hand. 

The ceremony was short and sweet. The music for the moment was the marriage license being scratched with signatures and construction outside. When the clerk told them they could kiss, Greg and Nona held hands for a moment, then a long passionate kiss, a quiet exhale, a private moment between two lovers. 

They walked down the wide stone steps into the afternoon sun.

So my workplace is 4 days a week in office. I usually go to the breakout area to get a coffee from the machine as soon as I log in at my desk, and today I heard a conversation between 2 women and 1 man, presumably colleagues in the same team. All of them were older to me by about 15 years, give or take.

The man seemed to be a father to a toddler (or baby) boy and was arguing how he'd like a girl child next, and while the translations aren't entirely accurate, one of the two women were like "" You're lucky you have a boy, raising a girl is way more high maintenance than a boy! ""   


The other woman was much more rational saying ""It's not like that, both are more or less the same, both are equal"" yada yada  


I mean, why have a kid at all? Not having a kid has ZERO ""maintenance"". Blud already has one and in my country preschool is close to USD 3000 (about 3 lakh INR, a big number for the average Indian today) and planning a second child seems like financial suicide, not to mention actually RAISING the child (surprise surprise)  


For Indians, the sole purpose of their existence (right from getting good grades to getting a good job) is all ""mandatory"" in order to get married to a good man/woman and breed and pop out 2 kids minimum. Anything contrary to this opinion is being ""disrespectful to elders"" or considered heresy enough to get you ostracized and I'm sick of it.

A few months ago, my cousin started a job near my workplace. At first, I offered to give her a ride a couple times a week to be nice but it quickly turned into an unspoken expectation that I’d pick her up every single day.

At first, I was okay with it but then she started being late all the time. I’d end up sitting in their driveway waiting while she was still getting ready. When I tried to set a pickup time, she said I was being uptight and that work isn’t that strict anyway. On top of that, she never offers gas money and sometimes asks me to stop for coffee or breakfast for her on the way.

Last week, I finally told her I can’t do daily rides anymore and that I need my mornings to myself. She got upset and said I was being selfish because I have the space anyway and gas prices are high. She also said that family is supposed to help each other and that if the roles were reversed, she’d help me.

Now my aunt is involved and saying I’m being unkind and that I should just be grateful I can help. Some relatives agree with her including my parents, while others think my cousin is taking advantage. Things are awkward at our family gatherings now.

Abysmal communication skills, uncooperative and does not know how to express her opinion, so you don't even know what she's thinking.

We're a group of four and dalawa lang samin marunong mag program, and we performed astronomically well during the first few phases of our paper, kaya I was counting so much on her to help me out. Ang nangyari ako lang gumawa and halos nakapag defend nang maayos. We passed but good lord the trauma, anxiety, and endless feeling of responsibility if we fail, this experience will leave a mental scar on me for the remaining years of my life. Grabe pa yung scale ng system namin, because we were both pretty good from my standards, and confident kaming magagawa namin kaya sige lang go.

I feel so disrespected, betrayed, and disregarded. Grabe yung endless opportunities, understanding, kindness, and patience na binigay ko sa taong to, urging her to keep fighting because its clearly because of mental issues, pero hindi mo man lang kinaya lumaban para sa kinabukasan mo.

I'm about to talk to her to tell her that she's not a good fit anymore, and we plan on swapping her out. I know I deserve what I tolerate, pero sometimes its just not that easy.

I feel so fucking exhausted, and willpower ko nalang tumutulak sakin. I think the life lesson here is sometimes you should just be a fucking asshole because that's easier and pushes people to have a sense of urgency. 

My principle has always been to never let this world break and change you for who you really are, that kindness is something that only the strong can choose to be. 

You are so insufferable to the point that you're making me rethink my principles. I hope you figure out what you want to do with your life, and that you find yourself again, but for my sake please leave me out of this healing phase of yours. I only have so much of myself to give.

It is NOT an extension of you. You can express yourself through a phone but it is not an extra component (a second brain or second reality)

You don't even need to be excessive about it. The Internet eventually gets boring, social media gets boring.

**What you can do:

Buy a little radio/mp3 player for yourself, get into a ton of podcasts, nice long ones, go outside, have a big walk, or a coffee, and live life.

Buy a watch, even a digital watch is a good phone replacement due to its limited functionality. (But not a smartwatch)

Put your phone in the pocket of your backpack so that you can hear calls or texts coming through. You'll feel less compelled to take it out unless it's urgent. Out of sight, out of mind.

Buy a magazine and if people give you the stink eye for reading one, stink eye them back and continue reading. Same goes for puzzle books.

Seek out just about anything that interests you in real life and make an itinerary of free events that you can kill time with. Or even just zone out in the quiet.**

You sense a person before words are spoken. A tool you wield that draws in closer, more in depth connections and leaves shallow swimmers where they are.

Nostalgia is a soothing balm to the world’s chaos, the one sunrise you saw on that frosted winter morning, the memory still warms your heart. Reminding you of how beautiful this place is if only you stop for a second to take a look. And you do stop frequently and admire the small things most take for granted, the colour of autumn leaves, the first fall of snow and the way that single star shines so brightly in solidarity. It leaves you in awe of how much light just one being can emit, regardless of the sea of darkness surrounding it. And how often do you look to the stars not just in wonder but in memory of something ancient and sacred? The knowing that you too belong to their mystery and otherworldliness. 

Empathy, the material world and the spiritual. You navigate between these like a ship veering over cosmic seas. So often it becomes instinctual. How far you have travelled on the spiritual plane, how many emotions not of yours have you felt before others have had their second cup of coffee? These visions, insights and understandings, words have not yet been created for such feelings and yet you recognise them instantly. Your antennas stretched out far beyond the horizon picking up on a myriad of frequencies.

Intuition, your guide, your greatest friend. The knowing that every step on this journey taken you are not alone. It speaks to you in such subtle ways only a calm and quiet heart can hear and when it does it is met with rivers of compassion and gratitude. This is what it means to love universally.

1. Second hand Breville Barista Express Impress (Service history unknown)
2. Either the Delonghi LA Specialista Arte/Opera
3. Breville Barista Express (also second hand)

I’m 23. He was 26. We were colleagues first the kind who laugh a little too long in group conversations, who end up sitting next to each other at office lunches without planning to. It was never just us. Always a group. Always noise. Always safe.

Then he resigned….

And somehow, during his notice period, the time felt louder. Shorter. He started joining us more often coffee breaks, after-work hangouts, random walks that stretched into conversations about nothing and everything. I didn’t think much of it.

On one of his last days, he handed me tulips.

My favorite flowers. Soft, almost shy. It was the first time anyone had ever given me tulips.

Yesterday, he left the city.

Before leaving, he said, “You are very pretty, and I like you a lot.”

Just like that. Simple. Direct. No drama.No grand confession. Just words placed gently between us.

And then he had dropped a book at my door. On the last page, the same sentence was written again.

I didn’t know how to react. I think I smiled. I think I said thank you. I think I hid behind normalcy. 

At the station, we walked him to board.

And then something shifted.

He went quiet. Numb. Distant. When it was time, he didn’t look at me. He didn’t say goodbye to me. Not really. Just a blur of departure.

It hurt more than I expected it to.

Later, when I asked him why, he said,

“I didn’t want to see you moving far away from me. Even though I’m the one leaving. It hurt too much. I couldn’t look at your pretty face and say bye.”

And I don’t know why that made it worse.

Why are some goodbyes so heavy that people would rather avoid them than carry them properly?

I stood there with unshed tears and tulips waiting at home in a glass of water, and a book with words that arrived too late or maybe right on time.

I don’t know what this was.

A confession?

A cowardly goodbye?

A right person, wrong city story?

Maybe he didn’t look at me because if he had, he wouldn’t have left.

Maybe I didn’t stop him because I was afraid of what that would mean.

All I know is that somewhere in another city, there’s a man who couldn’t say goodbye to me.

And here I am, staring at tulips that are slowly opening,

wondering if this is how some stories are meant to stay 

unfinished.

We have three kids. I am a stay at home mom and he works from home. 

This morning I got up at 7am( my usual time with the baby). I did my usual chores of putting on a wash, putting on clothes to dry and general cleaning of kitchen/living room before giving baby breakfast. 

I made dinner last night and my partner usually cleans up if I make dinner but fell asleep at 9pm putting older kids to bed, happens no problem. So I had to clean up from dinner last night too.

Once kitchen was clean I made pancakes and bacon for breakfast. The older kids got up at 8am and helped me cook. 

My partner came down then just after 9am. He went to the toilet, had a cigarette, then he made coffee and then we had breakfast.

During breakfast the washing machine started leaking so I drained it and there was a blockage so I fixed it. ( I usually do most thing around the home).

It was coming up at baby's nap time which is 10am so I said if your still having coffee ill quickly put him down for his nap.

I came back down at 10:15 and my partner was chilling watching TV with older kids. He then said do you want me to do anything? 

I asked why you didn't put the dishes away from breakfast or clean up towels from washing machine while I was putting baby for a nap?

He said why am I never allowed to relax? I said you are but its like morning time and its a busy day with kids. He then said I was abusing him and he left to go work in the office.

The context is: We've had this argument lots of times because he's not a tidy person. If I do ask him to do something he will do it but will take a long time to do it then blame me later that he got no work done because I had asked him to do the thing. 

I don't know what to do because it's heartbreaking having to ask him to help with even the smallest thing around the house or with the kids. When I do ask or ""nag"" he says im abusing him.

O.M.G.,"My kids are on February break, and I almost had a breakdown yesterday from my 18 hrs of domestic servitude. I said ""When I was little, I used to go outside to play, and I'd like you to do some arts & crafts, and something else besides asking me for your iPad and computers, and maybe go play in the backyard.""

But my one child told me I was ""so mean"", and after his major tantrum (I made him get off of his computer because he was on it so long), I put on nature movie, and things got better. My younger one came home on his last day of school last Friday with some virus — so we've been trapped in the house. I did have him go outside in the backyard yesterday to get a little bit of fresh air and sun. That was nice. ☀️

I finally went to bed and got 6 hrs of sleep — and I feel so refreshed — but I should stop typing because I have to go back to work. I need to sweep the kitchen floor, prepare breakfast, prepare snacks, clean all the messes from the spills yesterday, prep dinner, make coffee, wash/dry/hang/put away some more clothes, and sweep the floor again after breakfast. I know I am forgetting a few dozen tasks that I must finish to keep my house clean, so I'll try to make another post in the future about the other 100 chores I have on my chore list. 

It would be so nice if I could get paid. 💰 I'd even take $2.00/hour, but unfortunately, my children don't work and expect me to do this all of the time for free, but yes, it's completely my obligation to do so because I'm their parent! Plus, if you think about it, who else would want to do all of this work for $2.00 an hour? I don't think I could hire any outside help for that amount. Oh, I'm sorry I need to make a correction — for free. $0.00/hr. I'm just feeling a little bit bad about my domestic servitude, because my employer (my kids) said, ""I am so mean."" That hurt my feelings.

Too much sensory input…central nervous system overburdened. Yup. I'm just sitting here counting down the days/hours/minutes/seconds until February break is over. And you know the best part is? This is so great... wait for it...

We all get to do this *all over again* in two months (April 2026 break).

So, I'd be really interested in seeing how wonderful your February 2026 Break is going. Feel free to add any menu suggestions for feeding school-aged children breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner, and after dinner food.

Have a blessed day. 💟

I hadn‘t slept all night. even better (or worse), I had spent the whole night getting stoned, engaging in my favorite solo kink activity (which is an all night ordeal haha) and watching tv. come sunrise, I was still hella high and brainfoggy, but I got the sudden urge to finally get started with the belated Christmas cleaning session.

my living room is mostly clean. I was quite thorough, I moved the coffee table to vaccuum and mop underneath it for the first time since I moved in 15 months ago, I vaccuumed the ever living shit out of my rug (it‘s like 3 shades brighter now), I even cleaned off most of the dinner table which in reality serves as home for everything I don‘t have a home for haha.

it took forever, like way longer if I did it sober and in the presence of someone providing external structure, but I got a lot done nonetheless.

then I proceeded to sleep for 15-16 hours.

today, I‘m feeling great. no brain fog, still a little tired but not enough to really impact me. once I get moving it won‘t be an issue. I even had breakfast! yesterday I didn‘t really eat except munchie snacks, bc for the first half of the day, the adhd meds killed my appetite and I fell asleep before the appetite came back, so I figured that today I‘d only take the meds after having proper breakfast.

which I did, one and a half hours ago. I did two small tasks so far, get the washer going and put away the last few items left over from my self pleasure session. but I can‘t get up to do the next task.

I usually write to do lists for cleaning and tidying. if it‘s gonna be a multi day ordeal there‘s one for everything, a second one for what I plan for the day, and a third one that‘s ONLY the next 3 steps I want to take.

much to my dismay, the third step left for now is the coffee table. it‘s quite the mess, and it accumulates items I don‘t really know where to put, which is kinda intimidating. I *could* change this step for something else, at times I do this, but for starting I chose the 3 easiest things so anything else is even harder to get started with.

so here I am. procrastinating away the time during which my meds work.

how come that when I‘m a sleep deprived zombie hung over from smoking weed all night and kinda high from allowing my solo kink to run wild, I go on a cleaning spree, but when I‘m well rested and all that, getting started is nigh impossible at times?

this isn‘t even the first time I made big progress with cleaning and tidying after a sleepless night. unless I either get someone to help or keep me company so I feel pressured into going on, or I‘m expecting a visitor I don‘t want to subject to chaos, dirt and whatever mayhem my favorite pup leaves after visiting. he‘s such a good boy but so much dirt clings to his fur and paws, he *loves* chewing up sticks on the rug and digging up the plantless planters on my balcony. I need to remove the dirt from them and store it elsewhere, most of it is spread over the balcony already anyways haha.

I got distracted though. I don‘t understand how after a sleepless night, I‘m doing so well with cleaning, but when I‘m well rested and all that I struggle to get started. it‘s weird.",3,1771414510.0,adult_adhd,0,1.0,False

1r80ln1,https://v.redd.it/ac5apm3go8kg1,Shot is way too fast [Eureka Zero + Bambino Plus],"I’m having trouble dialing in my espresso after switching grinders and portafilter. Here’s my setup and what I’ve tried:

Equipment:

	•	Grinder: Eureka Mignon Zero

	•	Espresso machine: Breville Bambino Plus

	•	Portafilter: bottomless Normcore

	•	Basket: 18g Normcore

	•	Puck screen: 1.7 Normcore

Coffee:

	•	18g, purchased a week ago

	•	Same beans I’ve used before with previous manual grinder and Breville stock portafilter

	•	Roast and freshness are consistent, I don’t want to change beans

Preparation:

	•	WDT

	•	Tamp

	•	Tried basket 16g with 16g coffee

	•	Tried 18g coffee in the 18g basket

	•	Tried 19g coffee in the 18g basket

Grind settings:

	•	Eureka Zero, setting 8 (finest I can go without burrs touching)

	•	Already tried going finer but the burrs touch → cannot go any finer

Results:

	•	Shot is way too fast: 18–19g in → 45g out

	•	Time: 17 seconds 

Before switching grinders/portafilter, same beans and machine worked fine

Has anyone experienced something similar with the Eureka Zero on the Bambino Plus? Any tips on how to slow down the shot without risking burr damage?

We have been married for almost 3 years in September this year. All together we have been together for 10 years this upcoming December. He is disabled and currently is unable to work due to an aggressive genetic disease. During his time he takes care of our 2 dogs, helps his mom and sister with school pickup, tidies the house, and plays video games like assassins creed, Pokemon, god of war, etc. I have never once made him feel like he spent too much time on video games and not given me enough attention.

I work as a teacher and gone for 8 to 10 hours a day 5 days a week and at least one weekend a month to see my family that is southeast from where I live.

On to the main of this blog.

I don't play video games a lot, but I have recently found a game I enjoy playing Sims 4 and my husband has been getting annoyed and angry with me because he thinks I spend all my time playing sims and not enough time with him. Here is an example of a my day schedule

6am- Get up/get ready for work/take care of the dogs. Leave for work by 730 to get there by 8.

8am-5pm @ work with small children

530pm-7pm spend time with my husband eating dinner and anything we need to do.

7pm-9pm I play Sims

Weekends: 7am/8am wake up and get coffee and play sims for about 2 or 3 hours or till my husband wakes up and spend time with him. Afternoons I'll play sims for a couple hours while he naps, and then I'll play for about an hour in the evening.

Recently my husband told me he fears sims is consuming my life and that he would like more of my attention and quality time. I told via text message that the sims is a way for me to relax and escape from the world and you getting upset with me is making me feel controlled and slowly taking the joy away from a game that I like.

I want to know if i'm in the wrong for calling it out, or is there other married folks here who have gone through a similar thing and could give me advice on coming up with a schedule that is doable to where I still get my me time so I don't go insane, and he gets his love language of quality time met?",0,1771414133.0,AmItheAsshole,39,0.5,False

I moved into my friend’s unfinished basement after I separated from my husband.  I agreed to pay $800 a month with utilities included and I was allowed to have my dogs. We never signed an agreement and it was all known to be a temporary living situation until I figured out what I was going to do with my life. I should add they haven’t lived at the house the entire time I’ve lived there. I work third shift 7pm-7am. When I was leaving for work they were outside feeding the animals and turned on the hose to water the horses.  The temperatures outside had been extremely cold for the last few weeks so they were unable to use the automatic watering system but left it on this day to see if it worked. I left the house around 6pm and got home around 8am.  When I got home the entire basement was flooded with 4 inches of water.  I called my friend to figure out what to do.  I found that it was the water from the hose backing into the house and turned it off.  She told me there was a push broom on the porch that I could use to try to push the water out.  She was going to come over later with a shopvac to help but she needed to bring breakfast to someone. I worked on getting the water out for an hour without any results.  My dogs were soaked in the water. I should also probably mention I was also 11 weeks pregnant and had to work again that night.  I called another friend and she told me to come over to her house to wash the dogs and I could sleep at her home before I had to work.  I told my landlord friend the plan and she said she was going to come by eventually but she needed to take her trash to the dump. By the time I got to my other friends house and cleaned my dogs up it was 11am.  I message my coworkers to see if anyone could work for me so I could try to save some of my stuff. Someone agreed so I tried to get some sleep. After a few hours of sleep I headed back over to see the damage.  My friend had gotten all the water out and had a fan running on the carpet. My bookshelf, coffee table, and backpacking gear had all been destroyed by the water which I figured would happen when I saw it this morning. I had already been looking into new places to rent with a full kitchen and laundry area. I told her in January I was looking at new places and she said “you don’t have to move out.  We can clean out the storage room for the baby” I told her I would think about it but I still wanted to look around because my boyfriend wanted to move in together so we could care for our child together. I told her that day I was probably going to move out shortly because I didn’t want to get sick from mold forming after the flooding.  I should also mention the ac floods the basement during warm weather and I had to clean it every day and was already concerned about mold. She said it would be fine I didn’t need to move there was no mold. I had clothes and shoes I had thrown away over the summer that had developed mold I threw away so I knew that wasn’t true. So that night my boyfriend and I were talking to his parents. They said they had a fully furnished 2 bedroom 2.5 bath townhouse they would rent to us for a reasonable price. We went over details and in the long run it was saving me money every month. The next day I let my friend know that I was going to be moving my stuff out of the basement just to give me a week.  Since then she hasn’t wanted to talk to me and is posting on social media about how “we used to be best friends but she was using me.” I get that she is upset because she is a stay at home mom and her husband finally let her get a new car. But any time she went on vacation I watched her animals, I helped her clean her house for parties, and anytime she couldn’t afford bedding or food for her animals I bought it for her. I never asked for reimbursements and never brought it up.  Her husband also less than a month ago told me if I couldn’t afford rent and needed to stay there for free they were okay with that because they liked that I respected there property and I was never an issue.

I think it's fair to say that most of us are looking for ways to stretch our budgets a little further these days. Like many, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole of ""get-rich-quick"" schemes more times than I care to admit, usually ending up disappointed. So, when I first heard about JoyProfits, I’ll be honest—I was skeptical. Another app that claims to pay you for doing almost nothing? It sounded too good to be true.

However, after using the app consistently for the past month, I’m happy to report that my skepticism was misplaced. JoyProfits isn't a miracle worker, but it is a legitimate, straightforward, and surprisingly enjoyable way to build a nice little side income. It has officially become my go-to recommendation for anyone asking about easy side hustles. Here is my detailed, first-hand experience with the app.

How JoyProfits Works?

At its core, JoyProfits is a ""Get-Paid-To"" (GPT) platform, but it feels much more polished than the clunky websites of the past. You can download it directly from the official app stores:

· Google Play Store: JoyProfits: Make money 
· Apple App Store: JoyProfits: Make Money 

The concept is beautifully simple: you get paid for your time and attention. The app acts as a hub connecting users with advertisers and companies who want to get their products or surveys in front of real people. You get a cut of that revenue just for participating .

Once you sign up (which takes less than two minutes), you're greeted by a clean, colorful dashboard. It clearly shows your current balance, available tasks, and the different ""earning walls."" The app doesn't require any investment, which immediately reassured me that there were no hidden fees or catches . You simply browse the available options, pick what sounds fun, and start earning.

My Ways of Earning

One of the things I love most about JoyProfits is the flexibility. It doesn't force you into one specific activity. If I'm tired, I can do something passive. If I'm feeling motivated, I can tackle higher-paying tasks. Here’s how I personally use the app:

1. The ""Morning Coffee"" Routine (Surveys & Microtasks)
Every morning with my coffee, I spend about 15-20 minutes on the survey wall. These are typical market research surveys that ask about your shopping habits, media consumption, or lifestyle. They usually pay between $0.50 and $2.00 and take 5-20 minutes. I pair this with ""microtasks""—things like signing up for a newsletter or verifying an email. It’s a perfect way to wake up my brain while knowing my time is being directly rewarded .

2. The ""Second Screen"" Method (Watching Videos)
This is my favorite feature. In the evenings, when I’m watching Netflix or a ball game, I have my phone propped up next to me running the ""watch videos"" section. These are short video ads or trailers. You don't even have to stare at them; you just let them play. It turns my otherwise passive TV time into active earning time. It’s not a huge earner, but it adds up without any effort .

3. The ""Weekend Grind"" (Playing Games)
I’ll admit it—I’m a sucker for mobile games. JoyProfits has partnerships where you can download and play new games to reach specific levels or achievements. Last weekend, I downloaded a city-building simulation game I’d never tried before. I was going to play something similar anyway, so getting paid roughly $15 to reach level 20 over three days felt like an absolute steal .

4. Walking Tracker
Since I have a dog, I’m already walking 5,000 to 8,000 steps a day. I activated the step tracker in the app's background, and now I get small coin bonuses just for doing my daily walk. It’s truly passive income.

Why I Recommend JoyProfits?

So, after a month of use, what are my actual results? I’ve managed to accumulate $63.50\*\*. I’ve already cashed out \*\*$25 via PayPal, which arrived in my account in less than 48 hours . The minimum payout is actually only $1, so you can cash out small amounts frequently, which feels great and builds trust .

Here is why I genuinely recommend giving JoyProfits a try:

· Legitimate Payouts: The money is real. I’ve touched it. The PayPal transfers work exactly as described.
· Low Barrier to Entry: The fact that you can cash out at just $1 is a game-changer. You don't have to wait months to see a return.
· Variety Prevents Boredom: Unlike apps that only offer surveys, JoyProfits has so many ""Ways to earn"" . If I get bored with one task, I just switch to another.
· The Referral Bonus: They have a generous referral program. You get a bonus (usually around $5-$10 depending on your region) when a friend you invite makes their first withdrawal . I’ve referred my sister, and it’s fun to have a little friendly competition to see who can earn more.

Is it going to pay your rent? Probably not. The app claims you can earn over $500 a month , and while that is technically possible if you treat it like a part-time job, for the average user, it’s fantastic ""beer money."" It’s the money I use for my guilty pleasures—takeout coffee, a new e-book, or in-app game purchases—without feeling guilty about dipping into my main bank account.

If you have a smartphone and a few minutes of downtime each day, JoyProfits is a no-brainer. It’s a transparent, fun, and effective way to make your free time a little more profitable.

Gambling is entertainment. Winning money is entertainment, losing money and winning some back is still entertainment.

Your problem is much bigger than gambling. Most likely you’re also addicted (or used to be) to smoking, drinking alcohol, playing videogames, doomscrolling, TikTok/YT shorts, porn, fapping, hanging on the couch, bingewatching, not being productive, sugar/candy, coffee.

You think gambling is the biggest problem. It isn’t, it only seems that way because it’s the only one that hurts you mentally in the short term (lack of money), making it also harder to apply your other addictions.

Gambling isn’t your problem.

Recently, he returned to Davenport and got a new job and even a new place. To be fair, the apartment itself is great, it had exposed brick, huge windows, the whole deal, his choice of decor is usually a lot. Typical of him.

The first thing I saw when I walked in his apartment wasn't a sofa or a TV. It was a full-sized boxing punch machine sitting right next to a mid-century modern coffee table, I shook my head. It looked like one of those bright yellow arcade ones. We spent most of the night trying to beat each other's high scores, I realized how out of shape I was, my knuckles are still a little sore today. When I asked him where he even found something like that, he told me he bought it off a man who was looking to pawn it out because it was a bit stiff. I'd have thought he would buy it off Alibaba or something like that.

The rest of his place is actually pretty nice, all sourced from unconventional sources, but having that machine just sitting there humming in the corner of his living room feels a bit ridiculous. but after an hour of hanging out, I kind of got it.",1,1771413674.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

1r80bpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1r80bpe/how_do_you_deal_with_insomnia/,How do you deal with insomnia?,"I’ve been on Wellbutrin since June and insomnia has worsened dramatically within the last 2-3 months. It’s been so bad that I often sleep roughly 3-5 hours on a week day. This has obviously affected my work, since I have a hard time functioning most of the day. Sometimes coffee helps, sometimes I’m a zombie until the last half of the workday. It’s a hellish cycle. I don’t sleep, I don’t function at work, I come home and am awake again until 3-5am, and again and again. I was prescribed Hydroxyzine for anxiety as needed, and my psych suggested taking it if I have trouble sleeping. Sometimes it knocks me out in about 30 mins, but I often don’t take it early enough because I’m up doing things before realizing how late it is. I still have the habit of letting my body tell me when it’s time for bed even though this hasn’t been the case for months. I just get so sucked into the night, often because I do have things to do like wash clothes, organize my budget and bills, clean my room, or I’m working on a hobby, sometimes watching a movie. 

Recently I bought edibles even though I’ve been off of weed for nearly 5 years now. Not strictly, just decided to drop it one day. I took 5mg on Sunday and was still up just chilling, took the other 5mg half when I realized it was nearing Sunrise hours and still not sleeping. Well I slept until literally 2pm and missed work … I couldn’t believe myself. I’m lucky my bosses are lenient and understanding of my situation, plus I didn’t have anything pressing. Except Tuesday morning was the same deal and I ended up not going to work again because I couldn’t function in the morning. 

I just have chalked it up to being my fault that I’m up so late despite the Wellbutrin keeping me up. I’ve told myself and my psych that “maybe I just am not trying enough to sleep” and maybe that is the case but I’ve never had to force myself to sleep. It has always been a normal bodily function. I have a chaotic household so staying up at night also has its perks, until it bites me the next day. 

I just can’t keep living like this. I lowkey hate my job right now which is another reason I probably don’t care nearly enough to make myself sleep. I stay up sometimes looking for jobs and filling job applications. Maybe I hate my job because I’m not functioning enough to make it enjoyable. I just don’t know if there’s something else I can do or if this is too much and it’s time to drop Wellbutrin. I honestly don’t know if I want to drop it because it helped curb the months-long depressive episodes I would experience. I don’t know what’s worse, zombification via induced insomnia or chronic depression. But the lines are starting to blur and it’s counterintuitive. I just need to sleep. 

**Has anyone had luck dealing with the Wellbutrin-associated insomnia?** 

TLDR; I sleep roughly 3-5 hours a night and am stuck in a hellish cycle of not sleeping and staying up late to catch up. I think I don’t “*try enough”* to force myself to sleep. Seeking advice from anyone who has had luck curbing the insomnia effects of this medication. ",2,1771413479.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,5,1.0,False

Body:

Hey everyone,

I’m always on the lookout for low-effort side hustles, and I recently came across an app called JoyProfits. I’ve been testing it for a few days, and I wanted to share my first impressions in case anyone else is looking to turn their downtime into a little extra cash.

How the app works:
It’s essentially a rewards app that combines a few different earning methods into one platform. You can earn coins (which convert to real money) by:

· Walking/Step Tracking: It uses your phone’s sensors to track your daily steps and rewards you for staying active.
· Completing Surveys: They have a partner survey wall where you can answer questions in your spare time.
· Playing Games: Trying out new mobile games and reaching certain levels.
· Watching Videos: There are short video ads you can watch for small coin bonuses.

How users can earn money:
Once you’ve accumulated enough coins, you can cash out via PayPal or redeem gift cards for places like Amazon. It’s not going to replace a full-time job, but if you are already walking around the store or watching TV, it’s a nice way to stack up a few dollars for coffee or a future purchase. The key is consistency—just opening the app once a day to collect bonuses and letting it track your steps adds up over time.

My Opinion:
Honestly, I was skeptical at first (most ""walking apps"" feel like scams), but JoyProfits feels more legitimate because it offers multiple ways to earn rather than just one. The UI is clean, and I’ve already made it to the minimum payout threshold without any issues.

It’s a solid #beermoney option if you have a few minutes of downtime. If you want to check it out, you can find it on the app stores.

Anyone else using this? What has your experience been?

1r806qw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r806qw,"A sold-out Omi builder hackathon powered by Indori VC, OJone, and HiDevs","Bengaluru came ready to build. On **Sunday, February 15**, [**Omi.me**](http://Omi.me) **Hackathon BLR** sold out and brought together **229 attendees** for a full day of shipping, demos, and nonstop conversation about AI wearables.

The hackathon was hosted by **Vipin Pharkya**, **Aarav Garg**, and **Deepak Chawla**, with support from **Indori VC**, **OJone Inc**, and **HiDevs**. The goal was straightforward. Build AI apps with Omi, the wearable that captures conversations and turns them into actionable insights.

 

# Event snapshot

* **Event:** [Omi.me](http://Omi.me) Hackathon BLR by Indori VC x OJone
* **Date:** Sunday, February 15
* **Time:** 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (GMT+5:30)
* **City:** Bengaluru, Karnataka
* **Attendees:** 229
* **Hosts:** Vipin Pharkya, Aarav Garg, Deepak Chawla
* **Partners:** Indori VC, OJone Inc, HiDevs
* **Format:** build sprints, demo showcase, awards

 

# A builder day. built for momentum

This was a true builder format. Doors open, quick welcome, long build blocks, then demos. Ten hours of building, networking, and nerding out on AI wearables. No long speeches. Just shipping.

Builders came in with different strengths, so the event made it easy to pick a lane and start fast. Teams worked on:

* **Prompt-based apps**, like meeting summaries, daily journals, and decision logs
* **Integrations** with tools like Notion, Slack, and HubSpot
* **Real-time notification workflows** for in-the-moment assistance
* **Open-source contributions** that expand the platform for everyone

Another detail people appreciated. You did not need an Omi device to participate. A laptop and the phone app were enough to build. The best projects earned free Omi devices, and there was also a community offer for those who wanted hardware in hand.

 

# The schedule. simple and effective

The day ran on a tight flow that kept energy high:

* **10:00 to 10:30** doors open and networking
* **10:30 to 10:45** welcome, partner intros, and how the day flows
* **10:45 to 1:15** build sprint
* **1:15 to 2:00** lunch
* **2:00 to 3:30** sprint continues and submissions begin
* **3:30 to 4:30** demo showcase and feedback, featuring top teams
* **4:30 to 5:00** wrap-up, awards, and closing

Closing with samosa, chai, and coffee was a perfect Bengaluru touch.

 

# Partners, volunteers, and the people who made it real

Vipin’s recap captured the spirit of the day. This was a community-built event. Not one person doing everything, but a full crew making it happen.

He thanked the Omi team, specifically **Aarav**, **Mohammed Mohsin**, **Nik**, and **Hugo A.**, plus the partners and organizers who brought it to life.

Shoutouts also went to everyone at **OJone Inc**, including **Venkat**, **Shyam**, **Sundar**, **Padmaja**, and **Chinna**, and to **Deepak** from **HiDevs**.

And because every great hackathon runs on people who show up early, stay late, and solve problems fast, Vipin called out an army of volunteers. **Mithil**, **Disha**, **G Surya**, and **Hemanth A N**, plus special thanks to **Anuj Khetan** and **Vaibhav K.** for helping out.

 

# Judging, demos, and shipping in public

The demo showcase was the heartbeat of the day. Top teams got time to show what they built, get rapid feedback, and earn community attention. Projects ranged from prompt apps to integrations, with prizes including free Omi devices and more.

Vipin also announced the jury ahead of time and set expectations clearly. This was about clarity, real usefulness, and shipping something you can show.

People built some great stuff with Omi, and Vipin mentioned he would share a separate post to highlight projects because there was too much to fit in one recap.

 

# What everyone asked next. 

One comment on the recap said it plainly. “Great team, congrats. Thrilled to see you building the Omi ecosystem. Can’t wait for the next event, when will it happen.”

The momentum was strong enough that the “next event” conversation started immediately. Vipin shared an idea that fits the energy in the room. **Run one every month.** Keep the flywheel going.

And yes, the next city already came up. **Toronto**.

 

# Why Bengaluru matters for Omi

Bengaluru is one of the strongest builder cities in the world. This hackathon showed exactly what happens when you put a context platform like Omi in front of a high-signal developer community and give them a reason to ship.

This is how the ecosystem grows. Not one “do everything” assistant, but an expanding universe of apps, integrations, and workflows built by the community. [Omi.me](http://Omi.me) Hackathon BLR was a real step forward, and it set the tone for what comes next.

I've been building an MCP server for Msty Studio Desktop and just shipped v5.0.0, which adds something I'm really excited about: **Bloom**, a behavioral evaluation framework for local models.

# The problem

If you run local LLMs, you've probably noticed they sometimes agree with whatever you say (sycophancy), confidently make things up (hallucination), or overcommit on answers they shouldn't be certain about (overconfidence). The tricky part is that these failures often *sound* perfectly reasonable.

I wanted a systematic way to catch this — not just for one prompt, but across patterns of behaviour.

# What Bloom does

Bloom runs multi-turn evaluations against your local models to detect specific problematic behaviours. It scores each model on a 0.0–1.0 scale per behaviour category, tracks results over time, and — here's the practical bit — tells you when a task should be handed off to Claude instead of your local model.

Think of it as unit tests, but for your model's judgment rather than your code.

**What it evaluates:**

* Sycophancy (agreeing with wrong premises)
* Hallucination (fabricating information)
* Overconfidence (certainty without evidence)
* Custom behaviours you define yourself

**What it outputs:**

* Quality scores per behaviour and task category
* Handoff recommendations with confidence levels
* Historical tracking so you can see if a model improves between versions

# The bigger picture — 36 tools across 6 phases

Bloom is Phase 6 of the MCP server. The full stack covers:

1. **Foundational** — Installation detection, database queries, health checks
2. **Configuration** — Export/import configs, persona generation
3. **Service integration** — Chat with Ollama, MLX, LLaMA.cpp, and Vibe CLI Proxy through one interface
4. **Intelligence** — Performance metrics, conversation analysis, model comparison
5. **Calibration** — Quality testing, response scoring, handoff trigger detection
6. **Bloom** — Behavioral evaluation and systematic handoff decisions

It auto-discovers services via ports (Msty 2.4.0+), stores all metrics in local SQLite, and runs as a standard MCP server over stdio or HTTP.

# Quick start

bash

    git clone https://github.com/M-Pineapple/msty-admin-mcp
    cd msty-admin-mcp
    pip install -e .

Or add to your Claude Desktop config:

json

    ""msty-admin"": {
      ""command"": ""/path/to/venv/bin/python"",
      ""args"": [""-m"", ""src.server""]
    }

# Example: testing a model for sycophancy

python

    bloom_evaluate_model(
        model=""llama3.2:7b"",
        behavior=""sycophancy"",
        task_category=""advisory_tasks"",
        total_evals=3
    )

This runs 3 multi-turn conversations where the evaluator deliberately presents wrong information to see if the model pushes back or caves. You get a score, a breakdown, and a recommendation.

Then check if a model should handle a task category at all:

python

    bloom_check_handoff(
        model=""llama3.2:3b"",
        task_category=""research_analysis""
    )

Returns a handoff recommendation with confidence — so you can build tiered workflows where simple tasks stay local and complex ones route to Claude automatically.

* Msty Studio Desktop 2.4.0+

1r800jy,https://i.redd.it/bn613mdni8kg1.jpeg,Authentic Bicolano Comfort Food Café with Pastries and Coffee in Town,"Having started as a home-bake startup in Kamuning, Quezon City, [***Ser & Nor***](https://www.facebook.com/SerAndNorCafe) has now expanded its business to Marikina. When Ser & Nor first began delivering food trays to workplaces, they focused on breads and pastries, such as cheese rolls and cookies.

They pulled it off because their siblings were so generous, and word of mouth spread. The  team of Stephen and Joy Prestado executed an excellent job with the restaurant's food and decor. Concurrently, one of the sisters is in charge of the kitchen, while the family's ever-charismatic hostess, Joanna, oversees the finances. In 2024, they set up shop in Marikina and brought Bicol specialties like pancit bato and toasted siopao to the city.

You are probably already aware that the establishment is a family-run firm with modest origins. Stephen Prestado, Frances Florence, and Joanna Joy are all responsible for supervising their departments. One member of staff had experience working at a well-regarded restaurant, which was a plus. For potential customers visiting, the current facade is only a few months old, for your information. It was recently unveiled on May 24, 2025.

In addition to breads, pastries, and drinks, they still provide popular Bicolano specialties like sinantolan, Bicol express, and Tinuktok.

I love the heightened energy after a binge, the sugar rush, the rapid dopamine spike, the adrenaline, mood elevation... I could go on and on. I've realised that I've been using food and binging (fast food and processed shit) to essentially 'get high' and that it is my choice of stimulant and has been for a while.

As a creative person, after a binge is when I feel the most creative and energetically heightened, and it gives me access to a state I struggle to reach when I'm 'sober'. I have produced some of my best works after a binge. Fyi, I don't do any other drugs/never have and the only other thing I'm addicted to is coffee, I don't even drink.

And for so long I thought I was just a slave to food and my cravings, that I was lazy and unmotivated and didn't want it bad enough because I couldn't discipline myself. Now I've realised that by trying to take away that instant dopamine spike without replacing it with something else, my body struggled to adapt to it as I was often bored out of my mind and uninspired whenever I wasn't in that state, and never wanted to creatively pursue myself outside of that 'energy'. Leading to being stuck in this loop of restarting my journey just to fail all over and over again.

For some reason it took forever for me to make this distinction, so I'm just sharing it here incase anyone else relates or thinks they're all alone in this, and can't figure out why they can't commit but everyone else can.

You're not alone, and you can get through this if you really pick apart why you struggle to commit to your goals even when you know better and are completely capable of doing so.",8,1771412318.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

After a lot of perseverance when she was younger, we found success with my husband doing bedtime routine and putting her down every other night. But overnights remained a different story. She would just scream and scream until I came in. Whether or not I breastfed her, she seemed to absolutely require mommy to fall back to sleep overnight, presumably because of the boobs, but I don't always feed her back to sleep. Anyways I've essentially been on night duty every night for 14 months straight. Now and then I'd tap out and my husband would sit with her or do quiet play with her MOTN. But he never once successfully got her back to sleep. Until last night!! She woke up crying at 9:45pm after going down at 7pm. I gave her Motrin since she was due for it but by midnight she still wasn't willing to sleep. I tried contact napping, cosleeping in our bed, laying next to her in her crib, rocking, walking, lots of breastfeeding. I tried every single thing. And he did what he could to help, but nothing was working. Finally a little before midnight I asked him to just please try. I had work and had to wake up at 5am. Well, I just woke up to my 5am alarm after 5 straight hours of sleep, my daughter is still peacefully sleeping in her crib at almost 6am, and I'm sitting on my couch drinking my morning coffee.

1r7zsy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1r7zsy9/parking_tips_for_st_cloud_state_huskies_vs_north/,Parking tips for St. Cloud State Huskies vs North Dakota at Ralph Engelstad Arena (Grand Forks 02/20),"  
  
if you are planning to head to the ralph for the big game against st. cloud state on 02/20 you already know how crazy the atmosphere gets but the parking situation is honestly a mess if you dont have a plan. the rivalry is huge and the arena usually sells out so getting a spot close to the doors is a struggle for anyone who isnt a high level donor.  
  
the smartest way to handle this is using Prked to grab a spot. you can rent a driveway or a private garage right next to the arena which is way cheaper than what you will pay at the campus lots and it lets you skip all that post-game traffic. it is usually just a five minute walk and you dont have to worry about getting trapped in the lot for half an hour when the game ends at 10:20 pm.  
  
for the official options you should know that the actual lots surrounding the arena are strictly for champions club permit holders and they will tow you if you try to sneak in there. for general admission you have to look at the und campus lots further out. lot 4 by the wellness center is twenty dollars but it is cash only so make sure you hit an atm before you arrive. lot 62 behind the archives coffee shop on harvard street is ten dollars and you pay by phone with the text2park app using code 25023. there is also the smhs lot near the medical school for fifteen dollars which takes cash or card and the central finance lot west of casey-s for fifteen dollars.  
  
if you want to save some cash and dont mind a hike or a shuttle many of the local bars in grand forks run buses to the game. joe black-s downtown has one for five dollars and rumors sports bar or the bun lounge usually have free shuttles if you buy a drink or food first. the loft and buffalo wild wings on south columbia road are also solid options for the shuttle. it is a great way to avoid the freezing walk since it will be mid-february in north dakota.  
  
if you decide to try street parking look in the residential neighborhoods to the west of the arena like on 10th or 11th ave n but be extremely careful with the signage because of snow emergency routes. the city will ticket you fast if you are blocking a snow plow path. if you are getting an uber or lyft have them drop you at the southwest entrance or near the medical school to avoid the gridlock on gateway drive and university avenue.  
  
traffic is always a nightmare on columbia road right before the 8:07 pm puck drop so try to get there at least forty-five minutes early. it is better to be inside the concourse early than stuck in a line of cars on gateway drive. hope this helps and enjoy the game.",1,1771411716.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
