1qj8ygh,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexlessmarriage/comments/1qj8ygh/whats_the_deal/,what's the deal?,"I am a 33F HL who is a SAHM with a 41M LL husband who works long hours, 6 days a week at a fairly demanding job. we have been DB for about 4 years, with a few exceptions as we have 2 kids, 3 & 1. we have historically had intimacy issues in our 13 year relationship which had lead to us breaking up for about a year but ultimately reconciling & we have been married for the last 5 years. when my husbands job puts stress on him, our intimacy is the first thing sacrificed. we peck goodbye in the morning, barely hug. when I try to touch him he wriggles away. I am pretty much always down for the deed & he has said he only feels like being intimate in the morning before the stress of the day is on his mind. I have voiced that is not an option since I am up first with the kids before him, making him coffee & lunch for the day ahead. I recently asked to prioritize sex once a month, not a big ask in my opinion, & it would likely have to be in the evening. that was in october & no change since. I more recently suggested we schedule sex, something that seems to work for many couples. this is something I have suggested before & was told he would consider but didn't happen. this time asking to schedule I was met with an explanation of not wanting to make something so wonderful a job (to which I shot back that making it a job is better than nothing at all...) but was later met with a flat out angry no when I revisited the request. I don't want to blow our life up because I love our family unit & I do want it to work out. I also don't want to come off as ungrateful for the sacrifices he makes for our family because I tell him daily how much I appreciate that he works outside of our home & makes it all possible. I can see when he has (non-sexual) needs & I do what I can to meet those needs, even if they aren't needs that I have myself. We are a low debt household, I try to be respectful of our budget, I do work on the house myself (recently resided & repainted it) to save us money & improve on this shared goal while not adding to his stress. I have said many times we can reevaluate the labor distribution in our household if his job is making him sacrifice our relationship, this is always met with reminders or f pensions & retirement goals which are valid but dismissive of my concerns in our relationship. all of that makes it all feel sad & to be honest humiliating that I have been turned down several hundred times over the last few years when I present that my need is consistent intimacy. he shows me he is entirely uninterested physically but says he still wants to be intimate & acknowledges he 'isn't meeting his husbandly duties' (his words) but will not make a move. I should add he drinks, to which I have been vulnerable with him about & asked him to take breaks because the drinking takes priority over our intimate relationship. all requests were unsuccessful. after having kids I have gained a bit of weight but he has also gained weight over the last decade so I can't attribute it to no linger being attracted physically although I can't speak fully on it. I have no idea how to break down the wall. it seems like the same amount of work to stay & solve this issue as it is to leave. feeling torn as to what I should do. any men want to weigh in on what his deal is? any woman who are in similar situations have any breakthroughs?",1,1769026679.0,sexlessmarriage,0,0.99,False

1qj8y7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1qj8y7y/i_deleted_social_media_for_60_days_and_it_rebuilt/,I deleted social media for 60 days and it rebuilt my entire brain,"I was scrolling for 6 hours a day and didn’t even realize it.

Instagram while eating breakfast. TikTok while getting ready. Twitter during my commute. Reddit at work between tasks. YouTube during lunch. Back to Instagram in the afternoon. TikTok again at night. Repeat every single day.

My screen time report showed 6 hours and 20 minutes average daily usage on social media alone. That’s over 40 hours a week. A full time job’s worth of hours spent scrolling through other people’s curated lives, manufactured outrage, and meaningless content I’d forget 10 seconds after seeing it.

I was 28 years old and I’d spent probably 15,000 hours of my life scrolling social media. If I’d spent that time learning literally anything else I’d be a master at it by now. Instead I was a master at mindless scrolling and I had nothing to show for it.

My attention span was completely destroyed. I couldn’t focus on anything real for more than 2 minutes without feeling the urge to check my phone. Reading a book was impossible. Watching a movie without scrolling felt boring. Even conversations felt too slow, I’d be nodding along while mentally itching to check Instagram.

I felt anxious and inadequate constantly. Seeing everyone else’s highlight reels made my actual life feel boring and unsuccessful. I’d compare my behind the scenes to everyone else’s filtered perfect moments and feel like shit about myself.

I wasn’t even enjoying the scrolling. It was just a compulsion. I’d open Instagram, scroll for 20 minutes, close it, then immediately open it again without thinking. My brain was on autopilot seeking dopamine hits and I was completely powerless to stop it.

Every time I had a free moment, instead of being present or thinking or resting, I was scrolling. Waiting in line, sitting on the toilet, lying in bed, cooking dinner, any spare second was filled with social media. I couldn’t just exist anymore without input.

Then I saw my year in review screen time stats. 2,190 hours on social media in one year. That’s 91 full days. Three entire months of my year spent scrolling apps. When I saw that number I felt sick.

I was wasting my life one scroll at a time and I couldn’t stop myself.

So I made a decision: 60 days with zero social media. Delete every app, block every site, go completely dark. No Instagram, no TikTok, no Twitter, no Reddit, nothing. Cold turkey for two months.

It was brutal but it completely rewired my brain.

\## What I actually did

\*\*Deleted every social media app\*\*

Day one I deleted Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube app, Snapchat, everything. Didn’t just log out, fully deleted them from my phone so I couldn’t impulsively reinstall.

Also downloaded this app called Reload that someone mentioned on Reddit before I deleted it. It creates 60 day structured plans and more importantly, it blocks sites and apps during scheduled hours. Set it to block all social media sites 24/7 on my phone and laptop.

That way even if I got weak and tried to access social media through a browser, it wouldn’t load. External enforcement for when my willpower failed.

\*\*Removed the browser from my home screen\*\*

I moved Safari into a folder on my last screen page so I couldn’t easily access it to try browsing social media sites. Made relapse require multiple intentional steps instead of being automatic.

\*\*Told people I’d be unreachable on social\*\*

Sent messages to close friends saying I’m deleting social media for 60 days, if you need me text or call. Most people were supportive, some thought I was being dramatic. I didn’t care, I needed to do this.

\*\*Filled the void with the structured plan\*\*

The Reload app built me a complete 60 day plan based on my situation. It structured my entire day with progressive goals that increased week by week. Sleep schedule, workouts, reading time, skill development, everything planned out.

That structure was critical because without it I would’ve just sat around with 6 empty hours per day not knowing what to do with myself.

\-----

\## DAY 1-3: Withdrawal was real

The first three days I felt like I was going through actual withdrawal. My hand would reach for my phone constantly out of pure habit. I’d unlock it, see my empty home screen, remember I deleted everything, feel this wave of anxiety and restlessness.

I’d be eating breakfast and my brain would scream at me to open Instagram. I’d be sitting on the couch and feel this overwhelming urge to scroll TikTok. Every spare second my brain wanted that dopamine hit it was used to getting.

Day 2 I almost gave up. I was lying in bed and the urge to reinstall Instagram was so strong I had the app store open and my finger hovering over the download button. I stopped myself by thinking about that 2,190 hours I’d wasted last year.

Day 3 I felt genuinely anxious and irritable. My brain was in withdrawal from the constant dopamine flood. I couldn’t focus on anything, felt restless and uncomfortable, kept picking up my phone and putting it down over and over.

\-----

\## DAY 4-7: Boredom became unbearable

The rest of the first week was just brutal boredom. Without social media filling every gap, I had so much empty time and I didn’t know what to do with myself.

Eating meals without scrolling felt weird. Sitting on the toilet without Reddit felt uncomfortable. Lying in bed without TikTok meant I was just alone with my thoughts, which I’d been avoiding for years.

I started following the plan Reload built for me just to have something to do. Week one goals were simple. Wake at 9am, work out 20 minutes 3 times, read for 15 minutes before bed, learn a skill for 30 minutes daily.

The reading was painful at first. My brain couldn’t focus on a book for more than 5 minutes without wanting to check my phone. But I forced myself to sit there and push through.

\-----

\## DAY 8-14: Something started shifting

Week two my brain started adapting. The constant urge to check social media decreased from every 5 minutes to every hour or so.

I started actually reading before bed and kind of enjoying it. Finished a book for the first time in probably 2 years. My brain was slowly remembering how to engage with long form content.

The plan increased to waking at 8:30am, working out 25 minutes 4 times per week, reading 20 minutes daily, learning skills 45 minutes daily. I was filling the time I used to spend scrolling with things that actually improved my life.

Day 12 I realized I hadn’t thought about Instagram in like 4 hours. That was the first time since deleting it that it hadn’t been constantly on my mind.

Day 14 I had a full conversation with a friend without once thinking about checking my phone. I was actually present and listening instead of being half there.

\-----

\## DAY 15-21: My attention span started returning

Week three I could focus on tasks for 30-40 minutes without getting restless. My brain was starting to function like it used to before social media destroyed it.

I was reading for 30 minutes every night and actually retaining what I read. I was learning Python during the hour I used to spend scrolling and making real progress.

Work became way more productive. I could focus on projects for extended periods instead of constantly breaking focus to scroll. What used to take me 6 hours of distracted work took 3 hours of actual focus.

The plan had me waking at 8am now, working out 35 minutes 5 times weekly, reading 30 minutes, skill development 60 minutes. My entire routine had restructured around productivity instead of scrolling.

\-----

\## DAY 22-30: I stopped missing it

By the end of week four I genuinely didn’t miss social media anymore. I’d think about it occasionally but it was just a passing thought, not a craving.

I was sleeping better because I wasn’t scrolling before bed. I’d read for 40 minutes, put the book down, and actually fall asleep instead of scrolling until 2am.

My anxiety decreased noticeably. Not seeing everyone’s curated perfect lives meant I wasn’t constantly comparing myself and feeling inadequate. My baseline mood improved.

I had real hobbies now. I was learning to code, reading books, working out consistently, cooking actual meals. Things that required effort but left me feeling satisfied instead of empty like scrolling always did.

Day 30 I hit a milestone. Full month without social media. Longest I’d gone since creating my first account at 16. I felt proud of myself for the first time in years.

\-----

\## DAY 31-45: Everything accelerated

Weeks 5 and 6 my transformation really accelerated. I was waking at 7am naturally, working out an hour daily, reading 45 minutes every night, learning and building projects 90 minutes per day.

I’d finished 4 books. Built two small projects with the coding skills I learned. Lost 12 pounds from consistent workouts and better eating. My entire life looked different.

Work performance improved so much my boss asked what changed. Told him I deleted social media and he laughed but then saw my output had doubled and stopped laughing.

I reconnected with friends in person instead of just liking their posts. Actually grabbed coffee and had real conversations. Those connections felt way more meaningful than commenting on Instagram stories ever did.

Day 38 I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I felt FOMO. The fear of missing out that had driven my social media addiction was completely gone. Turns out I wasn’t missing anything important.

\-----

\## DAY 46-60: Complete transformation

The last two weeks solidified everything. My brain had completely rewired. Social media wasn’t part of my life anymore and I didn’t want it back.

I was waking at 6:30am, working out 6 days a week, reading every night, building real skills, being productive, living an actual life instead of watching other people’s lives through screens.

My attention span was fully recovered. I could read for over an hour without getting distracted. I could work on complex tasks for 2-3 hours straight. My brain worked the way it used to before social media fried it.

I’d finished 9 books total. Learned enough Python to build functional projects. Lost 18 pounds and was in the best shape I’d been in since college. Made real progress in every area of life.

Day 60 I hit the finish line. Two full months without social media. I felt like a completely different person than I was on day one.

\-----

\## What actually changed in 60 days

\*\*My attention span came back completely\*\*

I could focus on difficult tasks for hours. I could read books and retain everything. I could have deep conversations without my mind wandering. My brain functioned properly again.

\*\*I got 6 hours of my life back every day\*\*

Six hours that I used to waste scrolling got redirected into learning skills, reading, working out, building things, living. That’s 360 hours over 60 days. Fifteen full days of productive time instead of mindless scrolling.

\*\*My mental health improved dramatically\*\*

No more constant comparison and inadequacy. No more anxiety from consuming everyone else’s problems and outrage. No more feeling behind in life. My baseline mood was better than it had been in years.

\*\*I built actual skills\*\*

Learned to code well enough to build projects. Read enough books to actually expand my knowledge. Got in real physical shape. Developed hobbies. All things I “didn’t have time for” when I was scrolling 6 hours a day.

\*\*My relationships became real\*\*

Instead of surface level social media interactions, I had deep in person conversations. I was present with people. I built actual connections instead of just following hundreds of acquaintances online.

\*\*I knew myself again\*\*

Social media had been filling my brain with everyone else’s thoughts and opinions and content. Without that noise, I could hear my own thoughts again. I remembered who I actually was.

\*\*Work performance skyrocketed\*\*

My productivity tripled because I could actually focus. Got promoted because my output and quality improved so dramatically. All from just being able to concentrate without the constant pull of social media.

\-----

\## The reality, it was fucking hard

This was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. The first two weeks especially were brutal. My brain fought me constantly wanting that dopamine hit from scrolling.

There were multiple times I almost gave up and reinstalled everything. The urge was overwhelming. What saved me was the blocking through Reload making it difficult to access even if I wanted to, and the structured plan giving me things to do instead of just sitting with emptiness.

But pushing through that discomfort revealed that I’d been avoiding my actual life by numbing myself with social media. Once I stopped avoiding, I could actually build something real.

\-----

\## If you’re addicted to social media

Track your actual usage for one week. Don’t try to change it, just see the real number. That awareness of how much time you’re wasting might shock you into action like it did for me.

Delete the apps completely, don’t just log out. Make reinstalling require effort and intention instead of being automatic.

Use blockers to enforce the commitment. I used Reload which blocked all social media sites even through browsers and also gave me a complete structured plan to follow. External enforcement works when willpower fails.

Fill the void before you delete. Have a plan for what you’ll do with all that free time or you’ll just sit there miserable and relapse. Reading, learning skills, working out, anything productive.

Give it 60 days minimum. The first two weeks suck. Week three gets manageable. By week six you won’t even miss it. Your brain needs time to rewire.

Tell people you’re unreachable on social so they text or call instead. Real communication is better anyway.

Accept that you’ll feel FOMO at first. You will feel like you’re missing things. You’re not. Nothing important happens on social media. Everything that matters reaches you through actual communication.

\-----

\## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was scrolling 6 hours a day, wasting my life watching other people’s curated moments, destroying my attention span, feeling anxious and inadequate constantly.

Now I’ve read 9 books, learned to code, lost 18 pounds, tripled my work productivity, rebuilt my attention span, reconnected with real friends, and remembered who I actually am.

Two months without social media completely transformed my brain and my life.

You’re not going to miss anything important by deleting social media. You’re going to gain back hours of your life every single day. You’re going to rebuild your attention span. You’re going to stop comparing yourself to everyone. You’re going to actually live instead of watching.

Delete the apps today. Block the sites. Build a plan for what you’ll do instead. Give it 60 days.

The version of you without social media is smarter, calmer, more focused, and more present than the version endlessly scrolling.

I was seeing someone and then traveled so by the time I came back, it had been 2 months! He didn't unmatch me. He was cute and communicative. We talked for 3 days before he had to go away on a trip and that we'd meet upon his return. The week has been up a week ago. 

Guy 2 - left him a note on dating app. He matches to respond but does not engage otherwise. 2 days later I bump into him in person. I tell him I recognize him from the app and remark about him not being interested (in a funny way). He was realistic about something objective being the problem, although didn't recall who I was. It was a really nice bump in! He wanted to continue over coffee. I went back home all elated! But haven't hear from him since.

From my perspective, if I'm not reaching out to someone, I'm just not that interested in them. Or I have my eye on someone else. I'm going to assume that's what's happening with those two. Should I just unmatch? I'm 37F. 

Another part of me is like, well, 2 months passed for Guy 1, and when I saw his profile again, I changed my mind.

But I can't help but feel kind of cheap since there was a potential meet up but got ignored. Any thoughts?

The girl I liked and I were at a coffee shop and I was there while she was buying food. I decided to get something too. A $12 order, nothing too bad. Later that day I would go out with her to an event and my electric shaver unfortunately broke. I didn't even recklessly use it, it was just in a bag with other bathing and conditioning supplies and must've been dismantled by everything else, even though it already had its own back inside that very bag. As a result, I had to Doordash a new one. $31 spent. Now, the event we were originally going to go to was free, but turns out it was not hosting that day, so we decided to go do something else. There was a college party going on and only girls had free entry. Just to be safe, I took out $20 from my bank account. Turns out when we arrived, the party was free and my girl and I really didn't fuck with it.



Today. I'm walking out of my college cafeteria and in front of me are those ""donation organizations"" that usually haunt college campuses. Not wanting to be rude, I did the cheapest purchase they had. $20 spent. I'm also on my school's track team and later today I got a text telling me I needed to pay my dues for the season.

I bought one for me and one for my mom. Both had an issue with the lid not closing all the way, so the coffee wouldn't drain properly to give you the proper amount. Because it was retaining water, it would keep dripping for a while, which makes a mess if you have a larger coffee cup.



The settings Classic and Over Ice would dispense the wrong amounts.  The Rich setting worked properly. I contacted them, and through their process, they ended up sending me 3 replacement units at different times, but they all had the same issue.



After the 3rd replacement, they are sending me an upgrade, so I’m waiting to see if that has an issue also. I’ve never had a product that consistently failed like this, so it’s a new experience for me.

From conversations. With stories. From the phrase:

""We want to have peace at home,"" or ""It's important for us to want to come back here.""

Over the years, I've realized one thing.:

People don't come to me for tiles or a sofa.

They come for the feeling of ""finally, everything is in its place.""

There was a project where the customer said:

— This is my first time drinking morning coffee and I don't want to redo anything.

And for me, this is the highest reward. ☕️

Why is it important to contact a designer (and yes, me)?

Because repairs are always about emotions, money, and nerves.

And my task is to take the chaos on yourself, so that you will only have the joy of the result.

I'm thinking about the little things that you don't have

to consider: how the light falls in the morning

▪️ where it will be convenient to leave the bag

▪️ so that there are no sides in the shower

to make the house ""work"" for you, and not the other way around

I love my job because every project is about trust.

And trust is a responsibility that I take seriously.

If you feel that you want not just a renovation, but a well—thought-out house for your life

Cinderblock painted off-white. A table bolted down. Two chairs that never matched. One ceiling camera with a red light that blinked on a steady cycle. The recorder sat between Jonah and Marek with its single indicator light, indifferent.

Jonah set his notebook square to the table edge. Pen cap off. Coffee kept outside the room on purpose.

Ferraro stood near the wall, arms folded, not looming, just present.

Marek Lasker sat across from Jonah with his hands clasped, then unclasped, then flattened on his thighs as if he could force stillness into his body.

Jonah began the way he always did when he wanted the record to survive.

“This interview is being audio recorded,” Jonah said. “You understand that.”

Marek’s eyes flicked to the recorder. “Yeah.”

“You’ve been advised of your rights,” Jonah continued. “You understand them. You are speaking with us voluntarily right now without an attorney present. Correct.”

Marek hesitated, then nodded. “Correct.”

Jonah wrote the word down. Habit. Insurance.

He slid a printed sheet forward.

“Handwriting exemplars,” Jonah said. “I’m going to ask you to write two dictated sentences three times each. Then you will copy one paragraph exactly as printed. Then you will type a short statement on a department laptop. Supervised and time-stamped. Standard procedure.”

Marek stared at the paper like it was bait.

“I’m not doing that,” he said.

Jonah didn’t argue with the refusal yet. He went to time first.

“Tell me when you entered Building C the night of the third,” Jonah said.

Marek’s shoulders rose and dropped. “After midnight. I got the key. I went down. I checked the boiler. I left.”

“Time,” Jonah said.

“I don’t look at a clock when I’m walking down a corridor,” Marek replied.

Jonah leaned forward slightly. Not to intimidate, to narrow.

“Key fob log shows 01:55 at the service entrance,” Jonah said. “CCTV shows a person entering with a toolbox at 02:19. DVR runs seven minutes fast. That puts entry at 02:12.”

Marek’s fingers twitched at the word toolbox.

“I had a toolbox,” he said quickly. “So what.”

“So where is it now,” Jonah asked.

“In a locker,” Marek said. “Service corridor.”

“Which locker,” Jonah said.

Marek narrowed his eyes. “The one I use.”

Jonah waited.

Marek exhaled, irritation forced into compliance.

“Third one from the end,” he said. “Door sticks. You have to lift it.”

Ferraro’s attention sharpened. Details like that could be checked. They complicated easy certainty.

Jonah nodded once.

“Good,” Jonah said. “We retrieve it properly. Documented. Chain of custody protects you.”

“It protects you,” Marek said.

“It protects both,” Jonah replied. “It reduces guessing.”

Jonah placed a second sheet face down on the table.

“I’m going to show you an artifact recovered in the course of this investigation,” Jonah said. “Not to provoke you. To give you a chance to explain.”

Marek lifted his chin. “From whose phone.”

Jonah did not answer that. He turned the sheet over and slid it across.

LEFT BEHIND  
Abandoned Property Notice

Bottom right in smaller type: BLDG C FAC. USE ONLY.

Two spaces between FAC. and USE. A small error that would persist for years because nobody cared enough to fix it.

Marek stared at the two spaces longer than the title.

“That’s building paper,” he said. “That’s not mine.”

“How do you know it’s building paper,” Jonah asked.

“Because the printer does that,” Marek snapped. “Basement printer. It always double spaces. Everyone hates it. It never gets fixed.”

Ferraro glanced at Jonah. That was verifiable.

Jonah kept his face neutral.

“So you recognize it,” Jonah said.

“I recognize the building,” Marek said. “It’s my job.”

Jonah nodded once, then used the opening.

“Help yourself,” Jonah said. “If you know where it comes from, tell us which printer, which cabinet, which office controls the forms. That’s cooperation.”

Marek’s jaw worked.

“You want me to build your case,” he said.

“I want you to explain why a document tied to our incidents looks like it came from your building,” Jonah replied.

Marek leaned forward, anger starting to show in his throat and shoulders.

“Because the building is sloppy,” he said. “People post notes like they’re landlords. The superintendent thinks he’s a cop.”

Jonah wrote it down.

He slid the exemplars forward again.

“Let’s remove guessing,” Jonah said. “Write the dictated sentences. Copy the paragraph. Type the statement. If it doesn’t match, it helps you.”

Marek stared at the paper.

“No,” he said.

Jonah made the refusal usable.

“Why not,” Jonah asked.

Marek’s voice sharpened, but it wasn’t a speech.

“Because you compare it to something I never wrote,” he said. “Because you can say anything matches if you want it. I want counsel before I hand you a tool.”

That sounded legally sensible. Not proof of innocence. Proof he wasn’t careless.

Jonah shifted to work details.

“Tell me about the boiler,” Jonah said. “Model. What you did.”

Marek blinked once.

“It’s a Viessmann,” he said. “Old. Pressure gauge sticks. I bled the line and reset the control. It’s on the wall left of the expansion tank. You can see the rust ring.”

More verifiable texture.

“How long were you in the basement,” Jonah asked.

“Twenty minutes,” Marek said. Then, “Maybe fifteen.”

“Then you left,” Jonah said.

“Yes,” Marek replied.

“Did you go anywhere else in the building,” Jonah asked.

Marek’s eyes narrowed. “No.”

“Did you see anyone on the floors,” Jonah asked.

Marek’s mouth tightened.

“People don’t tell me their names,” he said. “They don’t even say mine. They call me ‘maintenance’ like I’m a mop.”

It was small, specific, and it stung. Ferraro watched the way it changed his breathing.

Jonah kept his voice steady.

“Do you want to continue speaking with us without an attorney,” Jonah asked.

Marek stared at the recorder, then away.

“No,” he said. “I want a lawyer.”

Jonah nodded once.

“For the record,” Jonah said, “you are requesting counsel.”

“Yes,” Marek said.

Jonah pressed stop on the recorder. The indicator light went dark. He wrote the end time, then wrote it again beneath it. Habit.

Ferraro opened the door. Jonah followed.

His phone vibrated in his pocket as he stepped into the corridor. He glanced down only long enough to see the preview.

Rossi: Hospital sent restriction memo. Elena.

Jonah’s grip tightened on his notebook.

He kept walking.

By the time he reached the bullpen, the hospital had already started writing its version.",1,1769025992.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1qj8ndb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qj8ndb/what_are_tokens_the_rise_of_the_smart_economy/,What are Tokens? The Rise of the Smart Economy,"Welcome back to r/CryptoCurrency Academy. In our last [Lesson](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qia3c3/the_world_computer_ethereum_and_other/), we discussed the ""World Computer"", Ethereum, and other Smart Contract Protocols. We learned that while Bitcoin acts like a pure currency, Ethereum is also a World Computer that runs any software in a decentralized way.

Today, we explore the most famous result of that innovation: **Tokens.**

Tokens are a type of CryptoAssets. 

# The Shopping Mall Analogy

To understand tokens, imagine a giant **Shopping Mall**.

1. **The Mall (The Blockchain):** This is the infrastructure. It provides security, electricity, and the rules of operation. Like Ethereum, or other Protocols.
2. **Cash (The Native Coin):** To enter the mall or pay for general maintenance, you use the mall’s official currency (like Ether).
3. **Gift Cards (The Tokens):** Inside the mall, specific shops can issue their own cards.

A ""Coffee Shop Card"" is redeemable only at the coffee shop. You cannot use it to pay the mall’s electricity bill, but within that shop, it is money.

You can also trade and sell Gift Cards on the open market, making them usable as currency sometimes.

This is how Tokens work. They do not have their own blockchain. 

They are ""guest assets"" that live inside an existing blockchain (like Ethereum). They piggyback on the World Computer's security so they don't have to build their own.

# Why Create a Token?

Before smart contracts, if you wanted to create a CryptoAsset, you had to build a ""Mall"" (Blockchain) from scratch. You needed servers, miners, and code. It was expensive and difficult.

With the World Computer, you can simply write a few lines of code to create a ""Gift Card"" (Token).

To make this efficient, developers agreed on a standard ""Card Shape"" (technically called ERC-20, while others also exist). Because all these tokens have the exact same technical ""shape"", they all fit into the same wallets and can be traded on the same exchanges automatically. This standardization caused an explosion of new digital assets.

# Types of Tokens

Not all tokens are trying to be money (simple Gift Cards), though almost all tokens can be freely traded on the open market.

In the smart economy, tokens usually fall into three categories:

**1. Utility Tokens (The Arcade Ticket)**: These act like tickets to access a specific service or product.

* *Example:* Imagine a cloud storage service built on the blockchain. To save a file, you must pay with their specific token. If you don't own the token, you can't use the software.

**2. Governance Tokens (The Ballot):** These act like voting slips.

* *Example:* A new kind of Company emerged called Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where Token holders have the power to vote.

**3. Asset-Backed Tokens (The I.O.U.):** Real World Assets (RWA) Tokenization is the process of representing something valuable in the real world with a Token on the Blockchain.

* *Example:*  A company buys a house for $1 Million US Dollars and ""tokenizes"" it, by creating 1 million tokens and selling them for 1.1 USD each. Each token represents a part-ownership in that house. The company can make a profit, and people can now own houses (or any other assets) in a decentralized way.

# Summary

* A lot of CryptoAssets have their own blockchain (Layer 1). 
* **Tokens:** Live on top of another blockchain. They might be the currency of a specific application, or any other type of Token.

Tokens transformed crypto from a simple payment system into a complex economy of apps, voting systems, and digital assets. 

**But as thousands of tokens filled the mall, the hallways became crowded**.

In the next lesson, we will explain **Scaling**: what happens when the World Computer gets too crowded, and how ""Layer 2"" solutions are trying to fix it.

See you in **Lesson 7**.

I’m a rural mail carrier. I’ve been doing this for 3 years. Never really had any major issues (minus greedy management always pushing for speed) and have been able to keep myself healthy enough to push through. The sitting part of the job makes it possible for me (driving route). 

Unfortunately, we got a new boss a few months ago and he started confronting me about speed and accuracy. Today I was on the phone with him and was honest that I’m doing the very best I can under the circumstances. I didn’t elaborate on my health but I was honest and said I’ve been struggling to keep up but that I’m doing my very best despite it. 

I had to go on a beta blocker, and even then I’ve been sluggish but still doing my best. It takes me a little bit longer than everyone else in the morning. The sleep inertia I feel in the AM sucks but I just drink coffee and try to ignore it. After I get out of the office I’m fine because I can sit down. 

He just brought up pretty much every mistake I’ve ever made that he can remember and told me I’m not doing this correctly.. I started to cry because I feel so deflated and destroyed. I can’t do anything today because my body is physically pummeled from yesterday which didn’t help. I feel like when I end up crying for whatever reason people don’t really take me seriously, or they assume I’m insane and mentally unstable (crying at the post office is seen as a normal occurrence because it’s so stressful). I wish I didn’t cry, but I can’t help it when my livelihood is on the line and I can’t make ends meet + I don’t have anywhere else to go.

The way USPS pays a carrier like me (a relief sub) is by an evaluated time that’s based on the regular carrier on the route. I don’t have nearly the experience compared to some of these people that have been doing this for 25-30 years. On top of that, I’m using my personal vehicle which is a regular car that’s haphazardly converted to RHD with my own money, and sometimes I won’t see a route for months and then  get thrown back on it on a heavy and miserable day like yesterday (holiday weekend and winter weather disaster). So I’m not really making a huge profit until I’m a “regular” carrier.. which I’ve been waiting for these past few years. 

The brain fog, high heart rate, and exhaustion is hard for me to grapple with some days. I’ve had it where I’ll have to take a 5-10 min break so I don’t throw up but I have ways to fight that. I genuinely like the job too so I’m doing my best to continue on despite these circumstances.. after yesterday (13.5 hour nightmare in a snowstorm) I’m not sure if I want to stick around but I have nowhere to go. 

I had to quit doing hair a few years ago. I went to school and spent a ton of money trying to “chase my dreams”. But it just wasn’t in the cards. I’ve never had a job that I’ve really liked until this one. I like driving around. I like interacting with the customers. I like to do something truly important like this. I go above and beyond for people out there. I try to take care of the customers the best I can. I’m just not a robot and I make mistakes and I have bad days every now and then. Envelopes stick together, packages slide around and get out of order. Stuff just happens and it takes time to fix it.

Idk I just had to vent a little bit. I don’t know what the future holds. I never do. But now I really don’t and I’m really sad about it.

1qj8hsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1qj8hsk/a_notip_restaurant_concept_viability/,A NO-TIP restaurant concept viability,"Full disclosure:

I used to run a successful food business, beloved by the community, before moving to the US. It was a great experience that taught me a lot of life lessons.

After ten years in the US and two non-food related businesses that by now pretty much run themselves, I am seriously longing for a restaurant here, in my new homeland. I love feeding people more than anything, I miss it, and I do have a thing or ten to offer food wise that seem to be otherwise missing locally.

***

Problem? I am vehemently anti-tipping. Check my other posts to see just how much tipping nauseates me on so many levels. Being cast on the American shores and having bent over backwards to adapt to the new culture, a full decade in still hasn't resulted in a change of mind on the tipping thing. I find it utterly degrading to both servers and customers. My entire being despises the practice, the business model, and the disgustingly entitled attitudes that stem from it. 

Yes, in my eyes the farmer who grew my food, the driver who trucked it to my vicinity, the chef who cooked it for me, the dishie who cleaned up after me, and even the entrepreneur who provided the lovely space for my food to be cooked and consumed in deserve admiration and extras a lot more than a person who carried it ten feet from the kitchen to my table. I'll die on this hill.

Naturally, I want my restaurant to be entirely tip free. I want people to walk in, see my menu, and pay exactly what they see. No extortion screens, no puppy eyes, no guilt tripping.

I've been running numbers for a while, and am pretty sure this is completely doable. Wide adoption of kiosk ordering, one person at the register, at the most one runner to and from the kitchen, all paid a decent living wage, no servers. Fast casual model as a conscious choice, to avoid servers. At this point I'm not looking to discuss the financial realities of starting a food business and hiring reliable staff in 2026.

***

➡️ Are the prevailing local attitudes and culture going to get in the way of my plans?

***

The reason I'm doubting my model will be well received is because I've personally observed it failing before. 

About 2 years ago a new cute coffee shop opened up in the area. No tipping as a choice, their stance advertised both on their website and on an unobtrusive sign at the register. For reasons of great coffee and their alignment with my beliefs, this shop quickly became a part of my daily routine. 

I cannot begin to tell you how many times I've witnessed customers there actively asking to tip and acting offended when told it's a no-tip establishment. It's shocking to see every time. The huffing, the eye rolls, the snarky comments! This is not a full service restaurant. This is a coffee shop. And still they catch hell for not taking tips.

It is usually the 40-45+++ folks, the ones I'm planning to target with my restaurant as well, the ones I lovingly call ""Karens and their lawyer husbands"", who are the worst offenders here. My main field is biology/medicine, so yep, yawn, the diminishing neuroplasticity and declining ability to adapt to novelty with age. Yep, yawn, I understand it's been ingrained into my dear Karens and their husbands that tipping makes them LOOK AND FEEL VIRTUOUS, and that's why they're stuck in that headspace. I'm still not willing to compromise. I won't let them tip at my joint. Doing otherwise would be betraying my core beliefs.

Long story just a tiny smidgen shorter. Sad to report that the coffee shop in question caved in to social pressure. As of last month, a tip screen has appeared at their register. They call it ""soft tipping"", standard options starting at 3%. Their website now says they accept ""soft tips"". They're trying to placate the local Karens. I talked to the owner, and they told me it was getting out of hand with Karens spreading lies at their little Bible study groups and gardening clubs, telling everyone who would listen that XYZ coffee shop is not to be supported because it severely underpays and obviously undervalues their staff. Which is completely NOT true, same baristas who were there at opening are still there 2 years later, and that says a lot.

***

I'm mildly terried to suffer a similar fate. Yet, no amount of tipping, soft, hard, semi-flaccid, is acceptable to me in my new venture.

Finally coming to the big questions, bear with me.

❓Is the damn tipping culture way too ingrained, friends? 

❓Is it impossible to break out of it? 

❓Is it too late in the cultural perception game to start swimming against the stream?

❓Am I better off putting my hard earned savings into a different venture rather than risking it with a NO-TIP restaurant in the American southeast?

So far I have accomplished:

\- Phone off at 9PM every night

\- Limit alcohol to a max of 2 beers/week

\- Drink water and have a pouch of applesauce right after waking up, before coffee

\- Take my most important prescriptions/vitamins at a consistent time

\- Limit phone use to checking texts once/hour from 6-9AM

  
Now adding on:

\- Drink some water and eat at least one bite of vegetables between 12 and 1PM

Calculating the per-bag cost while factoring in shrinkage, shipping, and multiple components is already a headache. But what’s really making it impossible lately is the market volatility.

I’m honestly tempted to just code a simple, free web calculator for myself—something with sliders where I can adjust the recipe and maybe even pull in some live market data to see the profit change in real-time.

I’ve struggled with borderline personality disorder and ptsd for the last 20 years or so (PTSD occurring later - never formally addressed as was already going through DBT therapy shortly after the event that sort of caused it). I have had therapy and dipped in and out of medications, but honestly between therapy and working on myself, I felt and do still feel it is mostly manageable without meds or further support but I have some long term habits that I just can’t seem to break, except I need to. 

My teeth are literally falling out of my face, and I’ve ignored it for ages but now one of my front teeth is on its way, I’ve opted to get them sorted, replaced with implants, with money I really do not have. Except they won’t do it unless I can pretty much give up smoking, and I really don’t know if I can. 

On top of this, I have a pretty wild diet that honestly I don’t know how I’m even alive sometimes. I have multiple days with no fruit or veg, so much less water than I should, sometimes 5-6 coffees, and OFTEN I eat more calories in absolute trash like chocolate, than I do on quality food. I’m also losing weight, so my calorie intake is massively reduced and yeah, I probably have entire days without any real nourishment. But I can’t seem to stop this either?

I gave her the silent treatment, then served her with divorce papers. Her ""break"" partner's wife was my secret ally.","She took off her wedding ring before she said a word. I heard that soft *clink* on the marble. The sound was… surgical. She wanted me to hear it. This wasn't a gesture of despair. It was an ultimatum.

I didn't turn around. I watched the pasta water swirl down the drain. The kitchen smelled of burnt cheese—it was our anniversary, and she’d forgotten. ""Colby,"" she said. ""I think I need a break."" Just like that. No fight. No tears. Just a ring on the counter and a sentence with no soul.

That night, at 2:34 AM, I heard the front door click shut. She didn't take a bag. You don't take off your ring to clear your head. You do it to make room for someone else's hands.

And that's when I started my countdown. Operation Radio Silence. If she wanted space, I was about to show her what the void felt like.

The next morning, I didn't ask where she'd been. I drank my coffee, black and cold, and said nothing. The silence between us screamed. Later, I checked her closet. The black heels she wore only on dates were gone. Her expensive perfume, the one I gave her, was missing. I wasn't paranoid. I was being erased.

But here’s where most people break. They beg. They plead. They demand answers. I did the one thing she never expected: I went silent. Completely. I became a ghost in my own home.

While she slept, I Googled how to file for divorce. My hands were steady. This wasn't anger anymore. It was a cold, clean calculation. I was done fighting for someone who had already left.

The next day, I called a lawyer. That evening, she came home humming, lips curled in a smile meant for someone else. ""Did you enjoy your break?"" I asked. Her smile flickered. ""Don't make this harder than it needs to be,"" she said. What she didn't know was that the papers were already signed. She wanted space. She was about to get all of it.

I moved out while she was at yoga. Left a note: *You asked for space. I'm giving it to you. Papers are with the attorney. Don't call.* I didn't leave angry. I left finished.

For days, nothing. Then, I saw them. At a café. Him in a peacoat, sipping a latte like a villain. And her… laughing, touching his wrist, wearing the perfume I bought her. My wife. On her ""break.""

I didn't confront them. I didn't cry. I walked away and sent one email to my lawyer: ""Serve her.""

The moment the papers hit, her panic was instant. Calls, texts, banging on my door at midnight. ""You blindsided me!"" she sobbed. But blinding someone requires darkness. I was just turning on the lights.

Then, the twist. Her sister called. ""She's been seeing him for months,"" she said. ""She called it 'needing something new.'"" And then… I found it. A letter *she* wrote to me a year ago, never sent. It said she felt lost. That she loved me but wasn't *in* love. The last line read: *""If I don't say this soon, I'm scared I'll do something I can't take back.""* She never gave it to me. She just did the thing she couldn't take back.

But the masterstroke came from an ally I never expected: *his* wife. Natalie. She emailed me with receipts. Hotel charges, texts, the whole timeline. Her husband was a serial liar. My wife wasn't his soulmate; she was his next target. Natalie's final line burned: ""She was never confused. She was calculating.""

I printed that email and left it in my wife's mailbox. No note. Just the truth. Two hours later, my phone exploded. She was outside my apartment, sobbing. I watched from the window, feeling nothing. Just closure.

She signed the papers the next day.

But this story has a final, dark turn. An envelope slid under my door. A positive pregnancy test. A note: *""It's yours.""*

When she called, her voice was a shaky performance. ""I'm pregnant. It could be yours."" I asked for the date. She gave one. A lie. I hadn't touched her since before that. ""It's not mine,"" I said. The line erupted. Crying, blame, manipulation. ""It would be simpler if it was,"" she begged. Simpler. That word said it all.

I forwarded the test to Natalie with two words: *Thought you should know.* Her reply was instant: ""Already suspected. Thank you.""

The final call was from my wife's mother. ""She knew,"" she said. ""She knew the baby wasn't yours and sent that note anyway."" That wasn't pain in her voice. It was shame.

The paternity test came back weeks later. 0% probability. The last thread was cut.

**This is a condensed version of a much longer narrative. The full story—with all the documents, the exact timeline of her double life, and a deeper analysis of the ""quiet revenge"" strategy—is available as a full-length documentary video on my YouTube channel.

So, what's the takeaway from this case study? This wasn't a story about winning. It was about strategic withdrawal. The most powerful response to betrayal isn't a louder noise. It's a deeper silence. She wanted to play a game where she controlled the rules and the clock. So I did the one thing that breaks all players: I left the casino. I didn't give her a villain to fight. I gave her a mirror. And in the end, she had to face the person she'd become.

The silence wasn't my punishment for her. It was my emancipation from her. And that… is the quietest form of power there is.",1,1769025244.0,u_Ok-Signature-3075,0,0.99,False

Yes, really.","I was watching TikTok accounts posting these ridiculous AI animal videos - Bigfoot drinking coffee, a gorilla doing a podcast, that kind of thing. One creator was getting millions of views.

Then I noticed something: his comments were flooded. Everyone wanted to know how he made them. What prompts, what tools, how he got the voice right. Same questions over and over.

Built a tool that lets anyone make these videos. Pick your animal, describe what it's doing, get a video in 30 seconds. Launched it in partnership with the creator.

Hit $3k in revenue within the first few months.

**The actual numbers:**

* \~$500 MRR at peak
* All subscriptions
* $17-80 price point

**What worked:**

Creator-led distribution. The TikTok creator promoted it to his audience. Zero ad spend. His followers already wanted what he was making, so conversion was easy.

Building fast. The whole thing was built and launched in basically a day. If I'd spent months polishing it, the trend might have passed.

**What didn't work:**

It was a trend, so as views on these AI Bigfoot videos died, so did the growth of the product.

**Biggest lesson:**

I sat on the idea of building tools for creators for months because I thought I needed to build something ""serious."" Turns out an AI Bigfoot video generator can make real money if you partner with the right person who already has the audience.

Distribution > product. The creator had 100k+ followers who already wanted this exact thing. I just built the tool.

**Next goal:** Find 10 more creators like this and replicate the model. The tool itself almost doesn't matter - it's the audience that makes it work. I've now also got a system using Vost that allows me to spin up these apps in less than a day.

Here’s why and what’s happening in the first week.,"I’m a founder, so yes there’s some self-promo here, but I think the experiment is interesting enough to share. 

As a SaaS founder, I’ve always hated SaaS pricing. You get to the end of the month, and my email marketing bill explodes because 10,000 people signed up to our newsletter and I forgot to upgrade my plan. 

Or I invite the wrong person into a workspace, and now I’m on the hook for an annual subscription.

This is what SaaS pricing is today, it’s pretty crappy, and we’re guilty of doing that the past few years too. 

What this means is that the big companies get all the features, have all the seats, and skip all the feature gates, where the smaller and mid-size teams are stuck hacking their way around. 

We decided to play it differently and thought what if we just let users pay what they want and in return, they get a genuinely capable tool:

project management  
documentation  
planning  
and notes

and let’s be transparent about this:

From $3 per user per month, thanks for buying us a coffee

Help us break-even at $14, thanks for lunch!

Or we suggest a fair price of $18, giving us a 30% margin to reinvest back into new features

No feature gates.

No artificial limits.

No “Gantt chart view costs extra” nonsense.

And yes, users can change their price later.

If Superthread starts creating real value for your team and things are going well, we hope our customers will increase what they pay voluntarily.

So what’s happened so far? 

We haven’t even properly begun promoting this, and we’ve already had new paying customers: a construction company from Croatia, a French interior design startup, and on the flip side, a SaaS power user who loved the tool so much, they dropped $100.

On average we’re tracking at about $19… so a small margin. 

Our Bet: PWYW will let startups and emerging markets access the same powerful tools as the big players. Long-term play.  

But this starts with trust. 

Curious what you’d pay or if you think this is just stupid… roasts welcome, but so is a $3 cup of coffee 😉",0,1769024815.0,SaaS,2,0.5,False

I'm 19 (m), from the EU, and I'm studying biology at uni. I don’t really have hobbies; all I do is eat, study, sleep, and occasionally wash the dishes. And for those wondering, I barely play video games - maybe a couple of indie games a year and an occasional 2-week Minecraft phase.

I'm quite (maybe a lot) shy. I rarely reach out to people first. I often suffer from anxiety & panic attacks, I have paranoia, I tend to overthink a lot, and I have anger issues - I can get annoyed by basically anything. Why? I don't know\~

I'm introverted and have had a pretty small social circle for several years.

I'm looking for people to talk to about random stuff - from +18 to \~20ish\~ years old, ideally uni students in the same or similar fields. I tend connect best with people who are similar to me personality-wise; I struggle communicating with people who are very different and those convos tend to die instantly & I'd rather avoid that.

I enjoy dark & edgy humor, memes and I love irony. I love arguing with people just to annoy them for no reason whatsoever.

I'm also obsessed with privacy; I don't like talking about my personal life too much so I never give out personal information & I have an unreasonable fear of getting d0xxed, so please don't ask <>

!I use arch btw

I’m mostly busy and don't have much free time - I don’t reply immediately, but I will once I'm available. I'm not on my phone 24/7

Not sure if I’m the ahole or not.,"Long story but I’ll try to make it short.  Fake names will be used but the story is about my best friend Edwin, his wife Sara and myself,  Dylan starting back in 2011.  (Slight history of Edwin and I)  we became best friends in fifth grade in Michigan and remained that way all through highschool.  We became roommates for two years and were so close it was weird for people to see us apart from each other.  Edwin’s parents moved to north Carolina shortly after we graduated and after our two year bromance of living together, he moved to be closer to his family.  This is when sara came into the picture.  We kept in touch weekly and I had heard all about Edwin’s new gf and had even talked on the phone with Sara multiple times before we had planned a trip for myself and a few other friends to vacation to North Carolina to visit. (It had been a year and a half since Edwin and I had seen each other at this point).  So the time comes and we make our way to North Carolina and it’s like no time has passed when we see each other.  Drinks were drank, reminiscing began and it was an all around great trip.  During the trip tho, Edwin and Sara had got into a few arguments and he would start belittling her and just treating her like shit.  Edwin is like my brother and if anyone was going to call him out, it was me.  I do believe I went about it wrong now that I think about it but I called Edwin out directly in front of Sara.  Along the lines of..”since when do you think it’s ok to treat a woman like that” “ are you trying to embarrass her in front of us or make it look like you are in control?”   It pissed me off to say the least seeing him yell at Sara and even making her buy him a new Xbox because she accidentally broke it.  I remember hugging her when she was crying because I could tell she was embarrassed and I told her that she can’t let him talk to her like that and to stand up for herself. (I have multiple sisters and am the type that feels I have to stand up for people who are scared to themselves).  After that whole ordeal, the rest of the trip was fantastic with no issues. (at least not in front of me). So a few more trips happen where I go back to North Carolina and Edwin and Sara come back to Michigan.  I am not sure if it was because I stood up for her but we kinda gravitated toward each other anytime we seen each other (more of a brother/sister feel). Playing guitar and singing together and just being goofy.  Edwin was there the whole time and it was all innocent and more than I could ask for.  I got to keep my best friend and he had a kick ass girlfriend.  Over the next few years, Sara would call me and ask for advice when her and Edwin would get into arguments or asking about what to get him for bday, Xmas ect.. and it normally wouldn’t stray to far from that.  Fast forward about 5 years down the road and they are getting married!  I’m the best man of course and it’s an amazing wedding with all our friends from Michigan together again and living it up in North Carolina.  And here is when it would all kinda unravel… I’m still in Michigan but I would just randomly drive to NC to surprise Edwin and sleep on the couch for a week.  Edwin worked a late second shift job (5pm-2am) so we would all hang out in the day time and when he would go to work, it would be just Sara and I for 7-8 hours.  We filled the time with video games, playing music, walking around and drinking.  One of the nights we had drank quite a bit and she became emotional and opened up to me.  Telling  me all of the problems that they are having and what not and then would throw in a “why can’t he be as sweet as you” or “would you ever treat me this way”. Which in my drunken mind I just thought of it as “she’s comparing me because I’m the one taking to her” not because she thinks I’m the greatest guy.  So this vaca time comes to an end and I head back home.  The year leading back up to my next visit had some red flags but I have always been naïve to women flirting with me or giving me signs they are interested in me.  Sara would keep in touch with me way more frequently than Edwin would.  She would send me memes and vine videos and stuff saying “this reminds me of us!!”  This wasn’t just like an occasional occurrence.  So my next trip to NC (we are all around 28 at this point) was something else and has never been told before now.  I drive in and get to their home at like 7am probably and plan on just sitting outside until they wake up to let the dogs out and see me.(surprise!!!!). Sara comes outside and about fainted from being so startled lol. We sit outside and have some coffee and just catch up before I sneak up into their room and cuddle up to Edwin to make him think I’m Sara.  He rolls over to my face like 8” away and the party begins! The excitement Edwin and I shared on those visits when we finally got to hang out in person again is a memory I will forever cherish. But this one would be the last.   Just like before, we would all hang out and have a great time and then Edwin would be off to work that late second shift.  Sara and I would do random things to pass the time and drinking seemed to always be apart of it.  First night we are drinking and doing some dancing/singing (not dancing on each other) and she takes off her hoodie.  Under her hoodie she was wearing just a old, worn tshirt and it went up and almost off with the hoodie…I’m not sure if it was intentional but she had full on flashed me and she did not act fast to pull that shirt back down.   She just said “my tits didn’t pop out did they?” While laughing and just kinda smiled and laughed it off as if it wasn’t a big deal.  A few minutes later she tells me she’s going to go and shower and she’d be back down after.  Im playing video games and trying not to think about how nice of an image I had just seen and keeping my shit together.  She comes back down after and sits by me and is wearing these lounge/sleep shorts that seem to turn into underwear when she sits down leaving little to the imagination.  I am in half panic mode because of the tension between us that I hadn’t felt until this moment.  I decide I am going to take a shower now and head upstairs.  I do purposefully leave the bathroom door cracked as this had all got into almost a fantasy type of situation and the thought that she might come sneak into the bathroom has entered my mind. Keep in mind we had been drinking but I jump straight in the shower without grabbing any other clothes or even bothering to ask for a towel.   The bathroom was set up where it was connected to the master bathroom and hallway that goes into the room I was in. She doesn’t come into the bathroom and that intense moment had passed.  Or so I thought.  So I get out after realizing I didn’t have a towel and I go into the hallway closet still naked to get a towel.  No towels and at that time she had heard me walking around and had made her way upstairs.  She sees me (I’m covering myself) and says “oh my god, I’m sorry! I thought you were done and dressed “. I go into my room and I ask if she can go get me a towel.  She does and when going to hand it to me thru the door, she says I am curious to see what you got..in a joking manor but still doesn’t let go of the towel.  She pushes her way into the room and I am very hesitant/nervous/know this is my best friends wife/a million other feelings.  Sara starts to slowly talk about how she truly feels about me and that she loves me and knows it’s wrong cuz I’m her husbands bf and all this and that and we end up having one of the most passionate, aggressive situations I have ever been apart of.  I hate myself for doing my best friend like that and I ended up pushing them both out of my life out of guilt and shame. To think  I could ever be that weak to do that to my best friend just kills me and I can’t face him anymore.  Sara has tried to contact me a handful of times, still confessing her love for me and saying she wants to be with me.  And I think the part the sucks the most is that I believe I have the same feelings for her.   All the moments that we had together before that night were something I long for in my current marriage.  The ease of laughter and conversation, the passion we only got a glimpse of that one night.  It’s been about 9 years since this all happened and I still think about it all the time.  Am I the ass hole?  Should I tell my best friend what happened and that’s why I lost contact with him? What do y’all think? ",1,1769024468.0,Medium,0,1.0,False

I’m curious about people blocking out memories and people and events ect...

I’ve encountered several situations where people seem to have actively or passively blocked out memories of emotionally significant people or events:

- A friend gave me a coffee table during a breakup years ago. Later, when I referenced it, he insisted he never owned a coffee table and didn’t seem to remember much of the relationship.

- A female friend told me that about two months after a breakup, she intentionally erased all reminders of her ex, deleted photos, got rid of gifts, and said she didn’t want to remember anything about the relationship. She even said ""may I never be reminded of that person again, I don't want remember anything"" even though they had a healthy relationship on the surface.

- Someone I spoke with regarding grief said they avoid thinking about their mother’s death entirely and gave away all of her belongings, despite having had a healthy, loving relationship.

I’m wondering:

Is this type of “blocking out” memories considered a form of avoidance, suppression, repression, or something else?

Is it ever a healthy coping mechanism, or does it usually signal unresolved grief or trauma?

What does the literature say?

I am just trying to understand the psychology behind this pattern.

The republic has succesfully integrated many of the peoples of africa and given them representation, prosperity and dignity, although it's an arab state and not a pan-african one it still accepts all cultures and faiths as equals under the law. Strongly anti-clerical and with a militaristic education and pension systems, the state strongly promotes patriotism and military service and expects all citizens to serve if called for conscription. But it also provides free elections, public healthcare, strong workers' protections and makes sure all of its people get access to these institutions and protections

Elsewhere in the world after a brutal war in the early 1930s the indian people managed to achieve independence on their own, but while their incipent republic is currently little more than a facade for the new rulers of the subcontinent - a coalition of petty bourgoise and officers - this new country is sure to shape the future of the region and the wider world

Further east still the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace managed to overthrow the old Qing empire and resist the advance of the russians, but it wasn't to last, a long periond of instability only ended with a civil war that brought socialism to China. A coalition of the lower classes imposed an idiosincratic model of socialism that saw a need for strict socialism in urban industry but a market approach in the coutryside, introducing corporations that rapidly expanded plantations all over the country

At their side stands the Republic of Japan, an ally and ideological neighbor with a similar history of instability ending in a republic led by workers and peasants. Although not a formally socialist state, they do share ideological similarities and the same economic base of corporate plantations, but where the chinese economy still hasn't developed much in the way of heavy industry their japanese friends have succesfully become a mayor producer of products like cars and engines as well as other consumer products like clothes

This are the only interesting mayor countries, the UK has universal suffrage, France is a boring parliamentary republic with census suffrage, the austrians and russians are still an aristocratic autocracy, the Ottomans and Persia have universal suffrage, Brazil is a dictatorship under Vargas

  
It was a low-ish infamy run (never reached 50) and at the end I gave the british investment rights and a bunch of other things in exchange for the trucial states so they bought 10% of my economy within the last year (went from a little over 90% owned by my people to the 80% you see now), I could've fought them for it but I didn't want to, they mostly bought and built plantations anyway. Now that I think about it I could've just turned off privatization but I usually just auto privatize everything all the time and then forget about it

  
India went independent all on their own, I didn't do anything, same with what happened with china and japan. I thought the british would be able to put it down and was pleasently surprised when they couldn't

  
It was mosly a legit run, but I did savescum three things

1. multiculturalism, when I abolished the monarchy it switched me immediately to ethnostate and most IG's had like 50% chance to roll ethno-nationalists and I didn't want to go that way. Minority movements (especially the ethiopian ones) gave me a 2% chance and so I went for it, thinking it'd fail immediately, but a lucky roll gave me +15% chance first thing so I decided to savescum it

  
2. The deal with GB, the game was about to end and the best I got was 50%

  
3. An early war against the ottomans I lost because it lasted too long and an ally insisted in adding impossible goals against GB

  
I wasn't really looking to get 1B GDP but I got pretty close. I had the best SoL, close to the best GDP/cap and the highest GDP, the thing that really hampstrung me was that I never developed much of a capitalist class and went pretty early for graduated taxation so investment was pretty low for the entire run. I also kept agrarianism for a long time and the second company I created was a plantation one, so a lot of early investments went into coffee (I was still 2nd producer by the end so it was all good). The economy was very reliant on imports of iron, coal and engines for most of the game until the last decades where I built a shit ton of mines. The other restraint by the end were the welfare payments, that made me go up to high taxes and even then kept me deep in the red, but I knew I could just downsize the institution whenever and the game was about to end anyway

  
The main thing were the major asian countries, this wacky communist Heavenly Kingdom with an economy based on petty bourgois agrarian corporations, an independent india and this republican japan with a pretty big economy which I found really interesting and wanted to share",5,1769024048.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

There are days where nothing “interesting” happens. I wake up, make coffee, sit in silence, do my thing, and go to bed. No noise, no explanations, no one needing anything from me. And somehow… that feels full, not empty.



I think we’re taught that being alone automatically means being lonely, but for me it’s been the opposite. Living alone gave me space to breathe, to think clearly, and to actually notice what I enjoy instead of constantly reacting to other people.



Sometimes it’s peaceful. Sometimes it’s boring. Sometimes it’s a little lonely. But it’s honest — and I’d take that over constant chaos any day.



Curious if anyone else had to unlearn the idea that quiet = something missing.

Started from a place of pure desperation after bombing several job interviews and watching my crush literally walk away mid-conversation. Turns out, most of us are getting this completely wrong.



The wild part? Your brain decides if it likes someone in 7 seconds. SEVEN. And get this, according to research from Princeton, people form judgments about your competence, trustworthiness, and likability faster than you can finish saying ""nice to meet you."" We're all out here thinking our résumé or personality will save us, but our primitive brain is making snap decisions based on tiny signals we don't even realize we're sending.



Good news though. These aren't mysterious genetic gifts some people are born with. They're learnable skills, and I'm breaking down what actually works.



The Power Pose Thing Is Real (But Not How You Think)



Before walking into any high-stakes situation, your body language matters MORE than your actual words. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy's research shows that holding expansive postures for 2 minutes literally changes your hormone levels, testosterone up, cortisol down. But here's the catch, don't do the pose IN the room like some weird superhero. Do it in the bathroom beforehand. Then walk in with that residual confidence. I tested this before my last interview and the difference was INSANE. You feel taller, steadier, less like you're gonna puke.



Steal Their Speech Patterns



This technique from Chris Voss's ""[Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.in/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805)"" is criminally underrated. Mirror someone's tempo, volume, and even specific words they use. If your crush says ""that's wild,"" say ""wild"" back naturally in conversation. If your boss speaks slowly and deliberately, match that. Your brain interprets similarity as safety. It's why we like people from our hometown or who went to our school. You're basically hacking their nervous system into thinking you're ""one of them."" Creepy? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely.



The Eye Contact Formula



Maintaining eye contact 60-70% of the time is the sweet spot according to research published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior. Less than that, you seem shifty or disinterested. More, you're a psychopath. But here's the pro move, break eye contact by looking to the SIDE, not down. Looking down signals submission. Looking to the side signals you're thinking. Huge difference in how you're perceived.



""The Benjamin Franklin Effect"" For Instant Connection



Sounds backwards but asking someone for a small favor makes THEM like YOU more. It's cognitive dissonance, their brain goes ""why would I help this person unless I liked them?"" I started asking new people for tiny things. ""Hey, can you recommend a coffee place around here?"" or ""Mind if I grab your opinion on something quick?"" Works with crushes, coworkers, everyone. The book ""[Influence](https://ia800203.us.archive.org/33/items/ThePsychologyOfPersuasion/The%20Psychology%20of%20Persuasion.pdf)"" by Robert Cialdini breaks this down brilliantly, it's sold over 5 million copies and for good reason. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human behavior. Cialdini is a psychology professor at Arizona State who spent 3 years going undercover in sales organizations, and the manipulation tactics he uncovered are WILD. Can't recommend it enough.



Strategic Vulnerability Beats Perfectionism



Everyone's walking around trying to seem flawless and it makes you forgettable. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that strategic imperfection makes you MORE likable, not less. Share a small struggle or mistake early. Not your deepest trauma, but something real. ""I'm terrible with names, sorry if I ask yours again"" or ""This networking thing always makes me nervous."" People relax around you because you gave them permission to be human too. Her TED talk has like 60 million views, clearly this resonates.



The ""Spotlight Effect"" Is Lying To You



Research from Cornell shows we overestimate how much people notice our flaws by like 200%. You think everyone's judging your nervous laugh or that you stumbled over a word. They're not. They're worried about THEIR OWN nervous laugh. This was genuinely life changing for me to internalize.



Remembering Names Is Your Superpower



Dale Carnegie wasn't lying in ""[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://dn720004.ca.archive.org/0/items/english-collections-1/How%20To%20Win%20Friends%20And%20Influence%20People%20-%20Carnegie%2C%20Dale.pdf)"", a person's name is the sweetest sound to them. The trick? Repeat it immediately (""Nice to meet you, Sarah""), use it once during conversation (""So Sarah, what brought you here?""), and say it again when leaving (""Great talking to you, Sarah""). This triple repetition locks it in YOUR memory and makes THEM feel seen. People will literally describe you as ""so warm and genuine"" just because you remembered their name. Easiest high-ROI move you can make.



For anyone wanting to go deeper into the psychology behind all these techniques without reading a dozen books, there's an app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)that pulls from relationship psychology research, communication experts, and books like the ones mentioned here. You basically tell it your specific goal, like ""become more magnetic in social settings as an introvert,"" and it generates personalized audio learning plans with adjustable depth. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, I usually go with the sarcastic narrator during my commute. It's built by Columbia grads and former Google AI folks, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. Makes connecting all these concepts way more structured than just random YouTube binges.



The ""Pygmalion Effect"" For Group Settings



Expect good things from people and they'll rise to meet those expectations. It's called the Pygmalion Effect, well documented in educational psychology. In group settings, assume the best of others out loud. ""I'd love to hear your take on this, you always have interesting perspectives"" or ""You seem like someone who'd know about this."" You're essentially casting them in a positive role and humans HATE disappointing the character they've been assigned. Works in meetings, parties, anywhere.



The thing about first impressions is they're not really about tricking people. They're about removing the static so your actual personality can come through. Most of us are too in our heads, too anxious, too performative. These techniques just clear the noise. And yeah, maybe it feels manipulative at first, but honestly? Social skills are just patterns. Nobody judges you for learning to cook or drive. This is the same thing.



Your homework is to pick ONE technique and test it this week. Just one. See what happens.

Instead, it has been surprisingly annoying and painful.

My first choice was the Niche, but after ordering I discovered there is now an added 25% tariff in the US. To be fair, they were thoughtful enough to email me directly about it, but I still had to painfully cancel the order.

So I logically moved on to the DF64 and placed an order, which I am now waiting to arrive. I have no idea how long that will take.

That said, this is not really where my frustration starts. When searching for grinders, each one seems to use its own arbitrary grind size scale. Why are we not standardizing on microns, like the Zerno Z1 does?

Anyway, I stumbled across a really interesting site that converts these barbaric numbers from most grinders into an actual micron measurement, and I figured it was worth sharing.

*What personality would my boyfriend have this time?*

When we first met, he was the boy I fell in love with, all wide smiles that reached his eyes and drank me in completely, as if staring straight into my soul. 

The original Kaz had the spirit of a golden retriever stitched into a human body. 

He jumped out at me in the library while I was searching for a book, towering over me, thick red hair poking out from beneath a baseball cap. Peeking behind a book, he offered me a grin. “Why did the fish cross the road?”

I already knew the answer to the joke. But I found myself smiling. 

Kaz was like this tiny flicker of sunshine illuminating my otherwise mundane day. 

“To get to the other *tide*,” I said, unable to resist a smirk. “Everyone knows that joke.” 

He grinned, raising a brow. “But I got your *attention*, didn't I? Guess I win.”

I stepped back, my chest fluttering. Butterflies. Fuck. An entire swarm of them bleeding through me, twisting my gut. 

I hadn't had this feeling since middle school. I thought I was asexual. I thought I didn't *want* a relationship. 

But this boy— this wide eyed, grinning boy was testing my boundaries. 

My cheeks felt like they were on fire, my hands clammy, my thoughts dancing. 

I found my voice, but I didn't trust it not to shake.  Love was war, and he'd fired the first shot. “I didn't know it was a *competition*,” I said, coolly. 

*Dodged*.

His grin widened. This boy knew what he was doing, perfectly hooding his arrow, the trajectory aimed directly at my heart. Charming, funny, with just a hint of teasing. “Do you wanna go grab a coffee?” 

Score. 

The arrow sliced straight through my right ventricle. No stopping it. 

I was too flustered to pull it out. “There's a coffee shop around the corner,” he continued his assault. This time moving closer, his breath in my ear. Another arrow, this time destroying my pulmonary valve. 

I was in big trouble. 

“How ‘bout it?” 

“Fine,” I said, shooting *him* back.” 

His smile was warm. “I'm Charlie,” he said. “But call me Kaz.” 

Bullseye.

One date, and I fell hard. 

He made me laugh so hard I snorted soda up my nose, and we were kicked out for being too loud. I realized far too early that I loved him. I was serious about him. 

I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. Then, after six months of dating, he… changed.

It was subtle at first. 

Sometimes, he forgot to brush his teeth.

He'd forget my name, insisting on calling me, “Girl.” 

One day, he turned up half dressed, his cheeks pale. 

I asked if he was okay, and he froze. 

His head snapped up, eyes narrowing. 

He’d been restless all evening, tapping his foot, drumming his fingers. 

“Why *wouldn’t* I be okay?” 

His voice was cold, sending ice trickling down my spine. I told him to forget it.

He punched the table, sudden and violent, lunging forward. That was the first time he scared me.

“Why wouldn’t I be okay, huh?” he demanded through clenched teeth. “Fucking tell me. Go on.”

He leaned in, lips curled. Then, just as quickly, he straightened.

“I’m fine.”

He drained his champagne in one gulp, spat it out, and politely excused himself.

The next day, he surprised me, running into me from behind.

“Attack hug!” Kaz laughed, wrapping his arms around me. 

I was still numb from the day before, but I figured it was stress.

A week later, he threw his backpack in my face.

“Don't fucking *talk* to me,” he hissed when I tried to cool him down. We were in class, and his sudden outburst caught eyes. 

I hugged him, and he jolted away from me like he’d been shocked. 

Eyes wide, lips parted. 

“Get *off* me,” he whispered, wrapping his arms around himself.

“Kaz.” I started forward, but he backed away, tears glittering in his eyes. 

“Get the fuck away from me!” He sobbed, falling onto his knees, eyes frenzied, like he was lost. Like he didn't know who I was. 

“Get away! Don't you dare touch me!” We were attracting attention. I heard the whispers. Felt dozens of eyes glued to me. “Abuse”, they whispered, judgmental glares sending prickles through me. 

Even my best friend was in someone else's ear, and I felt like I was hurting him. Just being close to him was sending him into hysterics. I backed away, but the whispers didn't stop. They were louder.  *“He's terrified of her.”*

So, with a numb heart, I left the classroom, breathless.

Later that night, he turned up at my door.

I waited for him; my heart pounding. 

*“What personality would my boyfriend have this time?”*

“Hey, babe,” he smiled warmly, kissing me on the cheek. “You okay?” 

I was done.

“You need a doctor,” I told him gently, my voice trembling. 

I couldn't bring myself to *touch* him.

Kaz inclined his head, lips curling into a smile. “Wait, why?” 

“Because you're not *you*,” I whispered. “The way… the way you're acting,” I held in a breath that was so sharp, splintering my lungs. “You need help, Charlie.” 

He rolled his eyes, but nodded, hugging me.

“I love you,” he whispered in my ear.

An hour later, he threw hot coffee in my face, screaming. 

Kaz’s brain scans were fine. 

He was completely mentally and physically healthy.

Which didn't make sense.

We slept together, as usual, his arms wrapped around me.

But in the middle of the night, he woke me up *screaming*. 

He kicked me, his kicking legs squirming, arms flailing.

“Kaz!” I shrieked. “Kaz, wake up!” 

His eyes flew open, wide and terrified.

His lips parted, stretching wider and wider. 

*“Please,”* Kaz whimpered, the whites of his eyes rolling back.

Sometimes when I didn’t give a shit I’d drink 7 cups a day, when I tried to limit my consume I was proud when I managed to only drink around 4 a day. So now my focus was just on quitting porn, doing sports and meditating and spending lots of time on hobbies like guitar and writing again. I didn’t really consciously drink less coffee, it just suddenly happened.

She spent months learning Portuguese before moving here with me. Duolingo, podcasts, the whole thing. She was actually pretty good.

First week in Lisbon she orders a coffee and the guy responds and she just... stares at him. Understood literally nothing. She thought maybe he was speaking Spanish or something. Nope, just Portuguese. European Portuguese.

Turns out almost every app teaches Brazilian Portuguese. And honestly? They sound completely different. Brazilian is slower, clearer, they pronounce all the vowels. We swallow half the word. ""Obrigado"" becomes ""obrigad'"" — the o just disappears. At normal speed it sounds like mumbling to anyone who learned the Brazilian way.

She basically had to relearn how to listen from zero. Was pretty frustrating for both of us.

It bugged me enough that I ended up building something to help with European Portuguese specifically. But even just being aware of the difference before you arrive helps a lot.

Then there's AIMA (the immigration office, used to be called SEF). That's a whole other story. We've helped a few friends through the process and honestly the main advice is: have everything ready before you arrive, expect it to take way longer than they say, and don't try to call them because nobody answers.

1qj7mcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1qj7mcj/aitj_for_waiting_to_tell_my_mother_about_our/,AITJ for waiting to tell my mother about our pregnancy?,"Hi all.

In August 2025, my (29nb) fiancée (27f) learned that she's expecting. We're having a son in April and we're both very excited. 

When we first found out, we had a lot of concerns about the viability of raising a baby in our current situation with regards to our combined income, living situation, etc. We both knew that going forward with the pregnancy would mean making significant changes to at least one of our jobs (probably both) and looking into new, more suitable housing. She also has pre-existing health conditions which we worried would affect the viability of the pregnancy itself (luckily, this hasn't been an issue; partner and baby are both perfectly healthy at 29 weeks). My partner strongly considered terminating the pregnancy, which was a decision I supported; when she asked for my honest feelings, I said I would love to raise a baby with her, that we have the support we need even in a worst-case scenario (my mother (57f) lives in a 3-bedroom house by herself, and would be more than willing to put us up temporarily if needed), but that I totally understood and shared her concerns, and would not be upset if she chose to get an abortion.

My mother isn't pro-life as far as I know, despite being a Christian, but has always been incredibly excited about the idea of being a grandparent. Our son will be her first grandchild, and I knew she would be heartbroken if we put the possibility of grandparenthood on the table only to terminate the pregnancy shortly after. Regardless of her feelings on abortion generally, I know she would be upset if we aborted her ""grandchild"" (even if we didn't consider it a child ourselves). For this reason, I suggested not telling her unless we knew with absolute certainty that we were going ahead with it, and my partner agreed.

We told several close friends about the pregnancy, in order to seek advice and input regarding whether we should go through with it. They all said it was ultimately up to us, and my partner specifically, but still offered some great insight that helped us both with the decision. It was a decision that we put a great deal of thought and consideration into, and we only decided firmly to go ahead with it in December.

Speaking to my mother recently, over coffee with the three of us, I thoughtlessly mentioned a conversation I'd had with one of our friends in November, before we'd told her. She became visibly upset and withdrawn, and asked how many people knew before her; I was honest and said she was one of the last people to find out. She asked why, and again, I was honest; I explained that we'd briefly considered abortion, that we didn't want to tell her until we'd committed to going through with it in order to avoid upsetting her, and that we told all the \*important\* people (including my father) \*last\*. She seemed to understand, but also said ""good answer"" sarcastically, implying that I was lying to spare her feelings.

Later in the evening, once my partner and I were home, my mother messaged me privately saying that while she did understand our choice to delay telling her and that she appreciated the reasons we provided, she was still hurt by the fact that most people knew before her. She reiterated that she was extremely happy for us and excited to be a grandmother, and that we will receive unconditional support from her (including temporarily housing us if we need it, which came up as a possibility over coffee), but that her feelings had still been hurt.

My husband is a forgetful person who breaks and loses things a lot.  And I mean a lot.  Whatever you initially thought?  Double it.  It’s probably still more.  

Some things I do: 
- I run a constant mental checklist of where his shit is at all times, so that when we’re trying to head out the door and he can’t find his wallet, I can say, “It’s under the couch cushion nearest the wall on our blue couch.”  This one isn’t super annoying when I do it to other people, but it is exhausting for me and mostly unnecessary.  And it does occasionally get me weird looks.  Last week one of my coworkers was looking for her hair clip and I told her I’d seen her put it on top of the fridge at lunch.  I think people find it a bit creepy to realize I’m observing them so closely.  
- I am the world’s most annoying backseat driver.  Twice in the last six months he’s gotten out of the car without putting it in park.  Sometimes he gets distracted and doesn’t see vehicles coming when he’s about to make a turn.  It’s somewhat legitimate for me to say, “There’s a car coming,” but I ALSO tell him things like when our turn is coming up.  I recognize this is obnoxious.  So far I am a normal passenger with everyone else in my life, but I worry this behaviour is going to spread to friends and other people.  
- I check whether he has everything he needs before we leave the house.  If I don’t do this, we have to turn around and go home multiple times, and are inevitably super late.  I’ve started doing this to my friends as well, and they understandably find it quite annoying.  Most people do not need to be asked “do you have your passport?” Before I take them to the airport.  Most people find that pretty infantilizing.  
- I try to protect his and our belongings from getting broken.  Today as we were getting ready to leave the house I noticed his laptop was balanced on the arm of the chair the cat likes to sit on.  I suggested he move it, and he found that a little irritating, as it was already on his mental list.  I have suggested to friends that their coffee cups are too close to the edge of the table, and asked if they’re sure they remembered to turn the oven off.  Nobody likes this.  It’s embarrassing that I keep doing it.  

So basically…how do I balance keeping my husband and I mostly alive and safe (and our important possessions not smashed or burned), with not being an unmitigated nag?  Some of this is helpful and necessary, but I don’t seem to be able to stop taking it too far.  And I really, really, really do not want it to spread to my other friendships.  I am already an anxious person, so it’s not like I’m the life of the party.  I am afraid I will soon be no fun at all to be around.  

Edit to add: yes, he has ADHD.  Side effects have made medications so far intolerable, so we’re resigned to managing it with strategies etc.  He is the kindest, most patient guy I’ve ever met, and I genuinely love and appreciate him.  This is not his entire personality.  But I worry that it’s becoming MY entire personality.  I’m happy to take on some extra organizing, but I don’t know what boundaries to set and how to set them in order to not become a monster.",1,1769023725.0,relationship_advice,13,0.67,False
1qj7ly6,https://i.redd.it/7y6wqhkk7reg1.jpeg,"I Need a Fix, Man!","Seriously. Haven’t we had enough?

Have you ever turned off your Wi-Fi and your cell phone for an entire hour? Maybe more.

It’s blissful.

It’s freeing. Like walking out of jail after several years. You look around. The walls. The outside through the window. Books on the shelf. And suddenly it all feels like a brand-new experience of life.

It’s glorious.

They call it a digital detox. Clearly an appropriate term, because we’re all *strung out* on our digital gadgets. It’s an actual addiction. *Like iPhone heroin.*

Have you ever experienced the trauma of leaving the house without your phone? It’s terrifying. You feel vulnerable and, literally, in danger. How in the world could I possibly exist without checking social media for an hour? S*urely it’s life-threatening.* I must be. It feels like it is.

Even as I sit here formulating this essay, I want to write it by hand. Desperately want to. On paper. With a pencil. But I just can’t bring myself to do it. I need a fix.

I sit staring at my phone – powered-down on the coffee table. I’m drinking a morning cup of coffee. Needing to write. Wanting to write by hand.

*But the craving is too strong.*

You see, I have these thoughts, thoughts running through my head. Thoughts I feel must be gotten down right away.

I try to put pencil to paper. But, I can’t.

I power up my iPhone 16 *rig* so that I can dictate this essay into my digital veins. I need technology.

The methadone of pencil and paper just isn’t the same. It’s not the same high. It’s not the same satisfaction. It all feels too slow somehow. Like my thoughts are so fast now that I can only capture them with technology. If I have to sit and write them out – longhand – I might forget something important before it ever comes to life on paper.

In this fast world of immediate gratification, even my thoughts demand immediacy. I have to post. I have to comment. I have to like. Nothing is slow anymore. I can no longer just sit with my thoughts and let them marinate into a well-constructed idea. And once they are, write them out by hand.

You know. The way Hemingway did it. Sitting in a café or a stark apartment. Writing stories in a notebook or tapping them out on a manual typewriter. Am I even able to think that way anymore? I used to. Before I had the digital monkey on my back.

I want to get *clean*. I need to get clean. I so desperately want to do the detox. I want to live an entire non-digital day.

Dare I? Can I find the strength of will? The courage?

I know I’m going to do it one day.

Maybe you’ll join me.

We never had much in common but really didn’t have anyone else so to hang around with so would spend lunches together and occasionally meet outside of school. However, towards the end of school I noticed that I didn’t feel I was as close as she felt she was with me. She was quite immature and would constantly talk about silly things and laugh at the same old stories. We have only met a handful of times since leaving school and I haven’t enjoyed it. 90% of the time is spent talking about silly things the teacher said years ago in English, or random other school memories that aren’t important now, and the rest spent talking about who she’s kissed on a night out which doesn’t really interest me.

Over the last year I think I have made it clear that I am not really interested in being her friend anymore. But I also feel bad as I know she doesn’t have many other people, and she is genuinely a lovely person.

Despite that, I also need to remember I am the only one who stuck by her the last 3 years of school and would spend every lunch with her and was always there for her when something was wrong.

She recently messaged me to ask if I could help her with a college project which I reluctantly agreed, however has now asked if we can meet up for a coffee.

I know it’s just a small thing but if I just suck it up and go then we’ll still be in the same position in years. 5 mins with her feels like 5 hours and I can’t be bothered anymore, I think we can still like each other without being friends.

Last August I started reselling a product on eBay I was buying from a UK store. I sold about £2,000 worth, which basically made a small loss of about £50 which was because I bought some things like a label printer for it. I still have about £100 worth of the product but it wasn’t for sale, so once those sell it might be a profit.

However, in march of last year I spent about £1700 buying and designing some art prints with the intent to resell them. I did this mostly in March 2025 so within the tax year.

I listed them all for sale slowly, but they don’t sell very well and I sold a grand total of 3 so far. However, after a couple of months my father passed away quite suddenly so I had to pull them from the stores whilst I recovered and sorted everything out. I have recently re listed them but I don’t think they sell very well online

They’re my brothers’ designs and he sold over 250 before so I don’t think they’re obsolete exactly, just very slow. He sold them in coffee shops and Etsy.

I am basically really unsure how to account for these in a self assessment.

I firstly am employed full time and according to my HMRC app I made about £28k (after pensions deductions) in the year, so I need to record the £2k trading revenue.

I just don’t know if I am supposed to use the cash or accrual basis? Do I declare a loss of £50 just on the reselling, or a loss of £1750?

I’d really appreciate any advice as I’m a little unsure on how to proceed with this. Thank you very much

Also to note I wish to do everything 100% ethically. I’m not looking for any tax refunds or anything like that, I just wish to declare the sales/what I did. I don’t think I’ll even have £1k worth of sales this tax year.

I make coffee for myself every day, and often up to 5 more coffees in the morning and early afternoon. The espresso shots are perfectly tasty and have a lovely layer of crema on top. However, after dinner time (6/7pm) I make myself my second and final coffee of the day, and it’s completely flat. No crema, it just looks like filter coffee. I usually have an americano with milk, and it looks like a cup of breakfast tea. It also tastes disgusting

1qj754j,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qj754j/the_psychology_of_introversion_6_sciencebacked/,The Psychology of Introversion: 6 Science-Backed Struggles and How to Actually Work With Your Brain,"I'm tired of reading posts that treat introversion like some tragic flaw we need to ""fix."" After
diving deep into research, books, and hours of podcasts by psychologists and neuroscientists,
I've realized most advice aimed at introverts is straight up garbage. Society tells us to ""just put
ourselves out there"" or ""fake it till you make it,"" but that's like telling a fish to climb a tree.
Here's what I've learned from studying introvert psychology, backed by actual science and not
just feel good bullshit. These struggles are real, they're backed by how our brains are literally
wired differently, and most importantly, there are practical ways to work with your nature instead
of against it.


**1. Social exhaustion hits different**
Introverts aren't just ""shy people who need to socialize more."" Our brains process dopamine
differently than extroverts. Research shows introverts are more sensitive to dopamine, so we
get overstimulated faster. Dr. Marti Olsen Laney explains this perfectly in The Introvert
Advantage (this book is a Pulitzer Prize finalist and she's a psychologist with 25+ years of
experience). The book breaks down the actual neurological differences between introverts and
extroverts. It's not about being antisocial, it's about how our nervous system processes
stimulation. This is the best brain science book I've read that actually validates what we've been
feeling our whole lives.
The fix isn't forcing yourself to ""build stamina"" for socializing. Instead, schedule recovery time
after social events like you'd schedule the events themselves. Block out alone time on your
calendar. It's not optional, it's maintenance.


**2. Small talk feels like actual torture**
There's a reason surface level conversations drain us more than deep discussions. Introverts
have more gray matter in their prefrontal cortex, the area responsible for deep thinking and
planning. We're literally built for meaningful connection, not chitchat about weather.
Susan Cain's Quiet: The Power of Introverts changed how I see this. She's a former corporate
lawyer who spent 7 years researching introversion, and the book spent like 7 years on the NYT
bestseller list. She argues that society is built for extroverts and introverts get punished for traits
that are actually strengths. Reading this made me stop apologizing for skipping shallow
networking events. Insanely validating read.
Instead of forcing small talk, steer conversations toward questions you're genuinely curious
about. People appreciate authentic interest way more than scripted pleasantries anyway.


**3. The ""why are you so quiet"" comments never stop**
This one hits hard because it usually comes from people who mean well but don't realize they're
basically asking ""why aren't you more like me?"" The question itself assumes something is wrong
with you.
I started using the Finch app (it's a self care pet app that helps build habits through daily check
ins) and one of the exercises helped me craft responses to this. Now when someone asks, I just
say ""I'm listening"" or ""I'm processing"" or even ""I'm comfortable with silence."" Most people don't
know what to do with a direct, unapologetic answer and just move on.
Also worth noting, research from the University of Michigan found that introverts make better
listeners and more thoughtful decision makers. So yeah, being quiet isn't a bug, it's a feature.


**4. Group projects and open offices are designed to torture us**
The rise of ""collaborative workspaces"" has been hell for introverts. Studies show that open floor
plans decrease productivity and increase stress, especially for introverts who need quiet to think
deeply.
If you're stuck in this situation, invest in good noise canceling headphones. I use them even
when I'm not listening to anything, just to signal I'm in focus mode. Also, try to negotiate work
from home days if possible, or find quiet corners and meeting rooms you can claim for deep
work time.
The book Deep Work by Cal Newport (he's a computer science professor at Georgetown)
completely changed how I structure my day. It's not specifically about introversion but it
validates the need for uninterrupted focus time. The productivity strategies he outlines work
insanely well for introverted brains. This book will make you question everything about how
modern workplaces operate.


**5. Canceling plans feels both guilty and relieving**
The guilt relief paradox is so real. You make plans when you're feeling social, then when the day
comes, the thought of leaving your house feels impossible.
Here's what helped me, being honest upfront. I started telling friends ""I want to see you but I
might need to bail last minute if I'm overstimulated, nothing personal."" Real friends get it. I also
started suggesting lower key hangouts, coffee instead of parties, walks instead of bars, one on
one instead of groups.
The Insight Timer app has some great meditations specifically for social anxiety and overwhelm.
It's free and has like 100,000 guided meditations. Way better than forcing yourself to show up
somewhere when you're already depleted.


**6. Your energy battery works backwards from everyone else's**
Extroverts recharge through social interaction. Introverts recharge through solitude. This isn't
preference, it's physiology. Dr. Laurie Helgoe's research shows that introverts literally need
alone time to restore their cognitive resources.
Stop feeling guilty about needing time alone. It's not selfish, it's self preservation. I started
treating alone time like going to the gym, non negotiable maintenance that makes me better at
everything else.
Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia grads
that pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned
above. You can set a goal like ""thrive as an introvert in social situations"" and it generates a
personalized learning plan with podcasts tailored to your specific challenges. The content depth
is adjustable, so you can do quick 10 minute episodes or go deep with 40 minute sessions. It's
been useful for connecting dots between different psychology concepts without having to read
ten separate books.
The Bottom Line podcast by the School of Greatness has an incredible episode with Susan
Cain where she talks about how introverts can thrive without pretending to be extroverts. Really
good listen if you're commuting or doing chores.
Look, you don't need to become an extrovert to succeed or be happy. The world needs people
who think before they speak, who listen more than they talk, who create depth instead of just
noise. Your introversion isn't something to overcome, it's something to understand and leverage.",2,1769022690.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False
1qj74qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOSloseit/comments/1qj74qm/lets_chat_about_pcos/,Let’s chat about PCOS,"Hey ladies I’m a certified gut health nutritionist and functional practitioner. I’m also a mama of five. I specialize in hormones, weight loss, environmental toxins, and metabolic disease. I also have PCOS myself along with a couple autoimmune diseases.

So I want to start with a simple question that doesn’t get asked enough: do you know what type of PCOS you have?

Because PCOS is not one thing. And that’s why so many women feel like they’re doing “everything right” and still can’t lose weight or feel normal.

Our bodies are not designed to lose weight easily. They’re designed to protect us. With PCOS especially, the body will sometimes release weight at first… 20, 40, even 60 pounds… then hit a wall. Then the weight creeps back on and brings friends. That’s not a lack of discipline. That’s physiology.

PCOS is not something you can fix with outdated diets, random supplements, TikTok trends, or spending hours in the gym. It’s way too personal for that. Two people can both have PCOS and need completely different approaches.

One of the biggest myths I hear is that everyone with PCOS needs to cut carbs, cut coffee, cut sugar, cut everything fun. That’s just not true. You can be eating “healthy” and still eating the wrong things for your hormones. Same goes for workouts. Exercise is stress on the body. With elevated androgens, insulin resistance, cortisol issues, or prolactin involvement, more stress and more movement is not always better.

At its core, most PCOS involves insulin resistance. But there are different drivers. There’s PCOS that develops after birth control. There’s inflammatory PCOS. Adrenal-driven PCOS. Insulin-dominant PCOS. Many women have more than one type layered together. That’s why guessing and copying someone else’s routine usually backfires.

Healing PCOS takes patience and compassion. It’s not about forcing your body to comply. It’s about listening to what it’s telling you and working with it instead of against it.

Some of the foundational things I educate my clients on look simple, but they matter more than most supplements ever will.

Eating breakfast matters. Coffee is not breakfast. A protein (30-40g) and fiber-rich (3-7g) breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar early, reduces cravings later, and supports hormone balance throughout the day.

Until you truly understand your hunger cues, the plate method helps a lot. Half your plate vegetables, a quarter protein, a quarter carbs. And the order matters too. Veggies first, then protein, then carbs. That alone can dramatically improve blood sugar response.

Snacking isn’t the enemy. Smart snacks actually help prevent blood sugar crashes. Yogurt with berries, apples with nut butter, hummus and carrots, jerky, smoothies, chia pudding, trail mix, roasted chickpeas. The goal is pairing carbs with protein or fat so your body doesn’t panic.

Eating out all the time makes PCOS harder, not because of willpower, but because of ingredients, oils, and portion balance. That doesn’t mean meal prepping the same thing for five days either. Gut diversity matters. It’s never a good idea to eat the same food multiple days in a row especially because bacteria can grow but also your gut doesn’t get the diversity it actually needs. I usually encourage produce prep and planning meals for the week, with one intentional day to eat out if you want.

You need to know if you’re deficient. Supplements can help fill gaps food can’t anymore, but quality and bioavailability matter. Taking random supplements without labs is just expensive guessing. Taking supplements that aren’t bioavailable is a waste of money. The timing matters, absorption matters, food pairing etc. if you’re body isn’t absorbing what you’re taking it does you no good. 

And this part gets ignored way too often: PCOS is hormonal, which means environmental toxins matter. A lot. Cleaning products, candles, fragrances, plastics, skincare. I see this constantly in practice. Women doing everything “right” nutritionally, but their toxin load is so high their body can’t calm down or heal. Using products just because you have used them all your life is not how you heal. You have to decide do you want to heal or do you want to manage. Toxins matter! Reducing that burden can make everything else work better. One of my masters is in toxicology. 

Most women with PCOS also have overlapping issues that never get addressed. Chronic inflammation. Gut dysfunction. EBV. Thyroid stress. These don’t always show up clearly unless someone knows how to look and how to interpret labs. Just because your doctor says your labs are normal doesn’t mean they are optimal. They are just normal compared to every other ill person that has been tested. 

If you’re struggling with PCOS and feel like nothing works, you’re not broken. You’re not lazy. And you’re not failing. You’re probably just being given advice that isn’t specific to your body.

PCOS isn’t something you overpower. It’s something you understand.

If this resonates, you’re not alone. And if you’ve been feeling confused or frustrated, that makes sense. PCOS requires nuance, not punishment. ",0,1769022667.0,PCOSloseit,2,0.47,False
1qj74p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/zootopia/comments/1qj74p2/hot_take_i_dont_think_the_train_scene_in_z1_was/,Hot Take: I Don’t Think the Train Scene in Z1 Was That Reckless,"So, having watched Zootopia 2 twice now, I can say that I personally thought it was…okay. Definitely not as good as the first, but perfectly fine. The reason? Along with pacing and certain jokes, I thought that Nick was treated like a real punching bag, and Judy had some really unlikable and insanely reckless moments.

One of the biggest counter arguments I hear for Judy is how her reckless moments are a progression from the last film, and how she acted. There are plenty of moments people mention, but the absolute number one moment cited is the train scene. She highjacked the train, told Nick to speed it up when another train was coming, and ended up crashing it.

In my opinion: I don’t think it was that reckless, nor did it justify her recklessness in Zootopia 2.

Now before you get the pitchforks out, let me explain. If we were to think that she highjacked the train just to take the evidence, then I would have no problem chalking this up as a needlessly reckless moment. But there’s one little detail people seem to gloss over with this scene.

Before Judy got the train rolling (hurhur), Doug talks about how he’s heading out to snipe another predator, loading up the gun and nighthowler, before Jesse and Woolter arrive with the coffee.

From that point, here are the options I can see available:

1. Take the case and sneak out to give it to the ZPD.

Outcome: Evidence gained, however taking what Doug was loading up could spook them. They could then torch the rest of the evidence and go into hiding before the ZPD arrives. Bellwhether remains in power.

2) Sneak out and tell the ZPD where the hideout is.

Outcome: Evidence gained, and with an ambush at the ready, perpetrators caught. However, you allowed a predator at that point to be sniped, turning them savage and possibly injuring and/or killing other animals. Also, the news would have alerted Bellwhether before the evidence could be traced back to her.

3) Try to fight and restrain the rams before taking the evidence.

Outcome: Possible if it was just Doug, but with the other two in close quarters, it would have resulted in two new lucky rabbit’s paws and a fox rug for the hideout.

With those the only available options, what was the alternative? And that’s not to say highjacking it was a bad idea, but all of them had horrible outcomes, and she only had a few seconds to decide.

I also noticed people said her decision to speed up the train was reckless, to which I ask: what was the alternative? Allow them and the next train to collide, killing them and  who knows how many on the other train? Trains don’t stop on a dime, where they were at distance wise, it would have been too late.

Endless articles, clickbait headlines, conflicting stories, and zero time to actually read everything. I’d either spend way too long scrolling or just avoid the news altogether.

1. There’s too much news and too long (like Game of Thrones never ending Winter haha)
2. It’s harder than ever to know what’s actually true and how to verify

Last month I started experimenting with a different approach, very short, quick summaries that tell you what actually happened in under 9 seconds, plus a way to quickly check if a story is likely legit or misleading.

Between global events, local stuff that still matters day-to-day, and headlines constantly contradicting each other, I either end up doom-scrolling or just tuning out completely.

Having local and global news in one place also makes a big difference. I don’t want five apps just to understand what’s going on. I believe my solution is Quick News Global (AI). Have you guys heard of this app in the USA?

Do you trust headlines anymore?

I’m in my late 20s, born in Canada but grew up in the UK. Both my parents are Zambian so I’m part of the diaspora. Thankfully I have a job that allows me to work remotely for periods so I’m planning to spend a couple of months living in Lusaka. Of course, a big part of time will be spent reconnecting with family and helping out with some family business. However, I’m curious if anyone can advise on the dating scene? My family has questionable relationship judgement to say the least so I’m not looking to be set up by them lol.

This is not to sound arrogant but I’ve travelled all over Europe, Latin America and Asia with a good amount of dating success since I would say I’m above average in looks, personality and income. I’m very aware of the dating pitfalls in developing countries and what to watch out for. I’ve been told that Lusaka won’t be a great place to date by friends/family and that I would be better off in a more international city like Johannesburg, Nairobi or even Accra but I would honestly prefer to visit Lusaka with an open mind. Few questions:

1.  Is Lusaka a place that I can approach women in malls, gym or coffee shops etc? Dating apps are fine but I prefer real life.

2.  While Zambians are friendly, I feel we are quite reserved compared to other Africans in the diaspora. Is this the same thing back home and will it be difficult to meet people or even make friends?

3.  I prefer to date well-educated and well-travelled women so are there any specific places I could meet these women in Lusaka? Things like co-working spaces or certain bars/restaurants?

4.  How do Zambian women view those of us from the diaspora? I’ve been to some places where there’s a little hostility towards those from the diaspora or people just try to take advantage since you’re not a local.

Double Cocoa, Cranberry Raisin, Peanut Cocoa, and Coffee Cocoa.

As someone who’s been off processed sugar for a while, these felt like a decent replacement when i am craving something sweet. They’re not overly sweet, which I liked, and the flavours are generally okay.

However, the texture could be improved because most of them are quite dense and chewy, which might not be everyone’s thing.

I especially didn’t hated the Coffee Cocoa flavour. The taste and texture genuinely felt like i was eating ground coffee straight up with cocoa.

Overall, I’d rate them 2/5. Not bad if you’re avoiding sugary snacks or cutting down on sugar.",1,1769022069.0,PeopleWhoEatProtein,0,1.0,False

Have you ever wished you could boost your memory? Whether you’re a student prepping for exams, a professional absorbing new information, or simply eager to retain cherished memories, memory enhancement audio could be your secret weapon!

Memory enhancement audio utilizes sound frequencies and rhythms to stimulate brain function. It’s a natural, non-invasive way to improve your cognitive capabilities while you go about your day—sounds intriguing, right?

## What is Memory Enhancement Audio?

Memory enhancement audio consists of soundtracks designed specifically to aid memory retention and cognitive function. These auditory tools can be:
- Binaural beats
- Isochronic tones
- Ambient music

Studies have suggested that these soundscapes can help create a conducive environment for your mind to absorb and recall information efficiently. But how does it actually work?

### The Science Behind Memory Enhancement Audio

Memory enhancement audio taps into brainwave patterns. Different states of awareness—like relaxation, focus, or deep sleep—are associated with specific frequencies. By listening to these tailored audio tools, you can gently nudge your brain into an optimal state for learning or recall.

The benefits of using memory enhancement audio include:
- Reduced stress and anxiety
- Improved concentration
- Enhanced longer-term memory retention

Why not explore this more deeply? **[Click for Details](https://l.sytixo.com/eutzzi)** 

## How to Use Memory Enhancement Audio Effectively

To truly benefit from memory enhancement audio, here are some practical tips:

### 1. Pick Your Setup

Choose a comfortable and quiet space. Create an atmosphere conducive to concentration. This could be:
- A cozy corner at home
- A tranquil park bench
- A coffee shop with soft background music

### 2. Choose the Right Audio

Not all memory enhancement audio is created equal. Some people respond better to certain styles over others. Experiment with:
- Nature sounds combined with binaural beats
- Instrumental music designed for deep focus
- Guided meditations tailored for memory improvement

### 3. Time Your Sessions

Consistency is key! Aim for short but frequent listening sessions. Ideally, practice for:
- 20-30 minutes while studying
- 10-15 minutes before sleep

#### Benefits of Regular Use
Over time, regular sessions can lead to:
- Sharper retention of information
- The ability to recall facts and figures quicker
- A more relaxed and open mindset for learning

Why wait to enhance your cognitive skills? **[Click for Details](https://l.sytixo.com/eutzzi)** 

## Incorporating Memory Enhancement Audio into Your Routine

Memory enhancement audio fits seamlessly into your daily life. Here’s how you can incorporate it:

### Morning Focus Routine

Start your day with audio crafted for concentration. As you sip your morning coffee, let those tunes ease you into a productive mindset!

### During Study Sessions

Listening to memory enhancement audio can drastically improve your focus. While hitting the books, put on your favorite auditory tracks. This is an ideal way to lock in information while you study.

### Wind Down for Sleep

End your day with soothing memory enhancement audio. Not only will it help your brain sort through the day’s learning, but it’ll also promote deeper, more restorative sleep.

## Conservative Use and Considerations

### Potential Drawbacks

While memory enhancement audio provides numerous benefits, it's essential to be mindful:
- Everyone’s response to sound varies; find what works best for you.
- If you find specific tracks distracting, try adjusting the volume or switching the style.

### Tips for Mindful Listening

Listen actively! Pay attention to how your mind and body respond during each session. Documenting your experiences could also help refine your listening practice over time.

## Real-Life Experiences with Memory Enhancement Audio

Many individuals report remarkable transformations over time. Here’s what some users are saying:

### College Student Testimonials:
- ""I never believed in sound therapy, but once I tried memory enhancement audio during my finals, my focus soared!""
  
### Professional Feedback:
- ""Incorporating these audio sessions into my workflow turned my once scatterbrained afternoons into highly productive blocks.""

These stories showcase just a fraction of the power of memory enhancement audio. It’s never too late to take control of your cognitive abilities!

## Final Thoughts on Memory Enhancement Audio

Memory enhancement audio is a promising tool for enhancing cognitive functions. Whether you’re keen on retaining information for studies, improving your professional skills, or safeguarding precious memories, audio can support your journey!

He has a demanding job and works a lot, I understand that, but he doesn’t do household work at all.

Examples:

1. Its always me who puts all the clothes in washing machine, I always ask him to hang it in the balcony to dry, he forgets this too sometimes.
2. Bedsheets won’t be changed until I do it and I wash it.
3. If something is lying on a place, it will be there until I clean it.
4. He will keep his nails dirty until I shout to clean it. ( he has improved a lot on this)
5. One day I asked him to change the dustbin bag and he didn’t even know how to open the bag and put it in the bin.

But I am kind of reached my threshold now. I understand he works a lot but atleast be thankful to me. Atleast acknowledge it.

On the other side, he does cook for me, makes coffee for me. I don’t cook much. Sometimes I think I am overreacting.

I love him a lot, and he is a very loving, caring and someone who has always been there for me. But I have started getting irritated over this ans fight a lot.

1qj6p1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1qj6p1r/hope/,Hope,"Hello. I (F,31) confessed here a month ago regarding my hubby (M,29) separating.

Here's my first post:

[First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/s/XGjoGalVi9)

Its been a hell of a year for us both (2025). Like any of us here, we had issues, childhood trauma, lots of fights, and then we eventually made the split (official) on Jan 2. He left to live with his family, while I took our house with our kids. The first week is pure agony. With of course so much anger and resentment to him. Second week I can say that I'm at peace, mostly happy, because I'm not stressed anymore with our constant issues. But last night, I don't know why. I felt lonely. I've been busy with my job, my business these past few days, but I felt something is missing.

Yeah guys, I messaged him. I said ""Wanna have coffee?"" which he eventually said yes. This was a surprise because ALL our text exchanges only include updates about our kids 7 and 8.

We went to a coffee shop, sat and talked. Asked each other what's up, how's life without a spouse. He was honest that he was lonely. I got honest too. I told him what I thought the past few days of separation. He also told me what he did.

We headed to our house, and sat in the living room, talking stories of what we did without fighting. Just like 2 friends catching up. We also talked about the hard stuff, like how he never intended to walk away from me. He said sorry for his bad choices. How lonely he was. I asked him if he wants to work on our marriage and he said YES.

Right now we agreed that we will go lowkey. No more bullshit posting about how happy we were (which isnt true and pressured us so much last year). And we take it slow. Meaning he doesn't need to move in (he wants to, but I told him not for now), and we can go on dates, go on rides, go enjoy ourselves. I told him we can create a NEW MARRIAGE. Ditch the unhappy old one, and rediscover ourselves and our love for each other. These all, we talked sincerely.

Right now its day 1. I am hoping we can recover. I know we are not perfect, but we are working towards fixing what we destroyed. We also booked therapy next next week, which he agreed to. I just want to post it here so everyone can know that sometimes separation can FIX it. But it needs effort from both sides. And to just be sincere about what you need from each other.

So I 23f have never had a boyfriend, no sex, etc (not religious, just didn’t prioritize in high school or college). I’ve tried the apps on two separate occasions (a year a part) and dated guys that I thought would make great longterm partners, but things ended around the 2 month mark for reasons outside of my control.

After having deleted the apps, I’ve decided I don’t really see myself using them ever again due to bad experiences. Things like being over-sexualized, being ghosted, bad communication, withholding information that impacts compatibility (ex. one guy had family that would disown him if we dated (due to race), but didn’t tell me until like 6 dates in lol), etc.

Now that college is over, the window of having consistent access to guys my age is over. Now, I just go to work, hang out with my friends 1-2x per week, and go to the gym. My current hobbies include self studying  Portuguese and Spanish, horseback riding, Pilates, and going to different coffee shops (I’m not a regular anywhere lol). I’m trying to make an effort to have more coed hobbies going forward, so for example, I’ve enrolled in coed soccer. I should also probably mention that I don’t drink, smoke, or go  clubbing. I just don’t have friends that are really into that, so I’ve never gone).

I just feel like outside of the apps, my chances are almost 0%. So, is there anything I’m missing or that I can change about my approach to meeting and dating men? Any other coed activities that I can partake in? I’m not really super pressed to date right now, but if I meet a guy in the wild and thing click, I’m not opposed to pursuing it. I know there’s no pressure, but I would like to make myself more available for it to happen. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",1,1769021743.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I am about to turn 23 and I have been meditating and interested in the mental health and the active participation of building a life that is intentional and enjoyable. I suffered a lot growing up and I knew that this wasn't the way I wanted to live my life, so I decided to do something about it. Meditation and mindfulness became my practice at 14 and I had no idea if anything was going to change, but over time my life got better and better. I think the biggest realization is that I caused my suffering and when I feel an uncomfortable emotion it is a learning opportunity for myself. Now, I love to say there is no such thing as bad, we create it. 

Anyways, what I've been doing for the past months was building a structure my business could fit in. I created a group with a friend of other coaches and we started to build individually, but together. The support has been the biggest help of everything. We met each week and helped the other coaches and taught each other what we learned and continue to do so. I built a website, client portal, LLC and everything else that felt like the right move.   
  
Now, I have been creating a social media presence which has been fun, but I don't think it is as important as getting myself in front of other people. I have been networking everywhere I go and when it feels right. I love talking about coaching because I am absolutely passionate about it. I create my own theories as I experience life and they help me guide other people to their own inner knowing. I am leading meditation groups from time to time and offering first session certificates to people who are my dream client. I like the idea that someone knows what their signing up for before they pay, so I always give an hour of my time to get to know the other person and explore lightly.

I've been doing more, but networking and putting myself in front of others has been what feels like the most important move to me. I am interested to hear more about what others are doing or what they did when they first started. I am also looking to network, so if anyone wants to meet I would love to get some virtual coffee and learn more about your practice and what got you into coaching. :)",3,1769021627.0,lifecoaching,0,1.0,False

Long post, been awhile since I've ran a modded playthrough. I'm attempting to find an America Rising 2 load order that adds in some of the additional things I'm looking for (mainly faction overhauls and settlement enhancements, other mods I've liked but not sure how compatible with the AE update) for a more in depth experience of the game alongside AR2. 

  
Previous version of this list was definitely in the wrong order, got around fine for about 3 hours before freezing started happening building at Sanctuary. I've tried my best to reorder, but I haven't tried to use this many mods in any list before and looking for any advice on the load order and possible replacement mods if the ones I'm using should be swapped. Only additional mod I was currently thinking of adding was SimpleGreen or something similar, but again looking for some advice from the experts.

  
[LO Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cK3Mnh8ALt-3Ncnii9itZ8xcSToqqJUMHzaZuV9co0M/edit?usp=sharing)

  
Additional mod recommendations are welcome as well, after getting some feedback on the order I plan on continuing to test some version of this. Have 46.19 MB of free space for any recommended adds.

  
Two things for sure wrong from the intro and vault, Codsworth color pre-vault and the vault elevator missing but functions normally - photos attached.

And here’s the thing nobody likes to hear, people don’t reply because of your offer.

They reply because you accidentally poked the right part of their brain.

Most cold emails fail not because the product sucks, but because they feel like airport announcements. Safe, predictable, instantly ignorable.

What actually gets replies looks more like this:

1/ Stop assuming people read cold emails logically 

They don’t, they skim them half-asleep between meetings, Slack pings, and coffee refills. You’ve got maybe three seconds before your message gets mentally filed under ‘not my problem’.

That’s why pattern-breaking matters more than polishing your pitch. Everyone opens with the same ‘hope you’re well’ opener. So when something doesn’t look like a cold email, the brain goes ‘wait, what?’ and pauses. A weird first line, a question they weren’t expecting, a reference that only makes sense for them, anything that doesn’t scream template.

2/ Giving before asking beats asking every time 

Most emails open with ‘can I have 15 minutes?’ which is wild when you think about it. You’re asking a stranger for time without giving them a reason to care.

Flip it - ‘Noticed this about your setup, here’s something useful’ That works for a boring psychological reason, people hate feeling like freeloaders. When you give first, even something small, it creates a subtle pull to respond.

3/ Social proof works, but only when it’s not cringe

Dropping ‘we worked with Nike when you’re emailing a 20-person B2B SaaS is like wearing a tuxedo to a gym. Impressive, completely wrong context.

The brain doesn’t think big brand equals good. It thinks people like me didn’t die doing this, so maybe I won’t either.

4/ Authority matters, but only if you show it instead of announcing it 

Saying ‘we’re experts’ means nothing, casually mentioning you’ve looked at 300 campaigns and most fail for the same boring reason? That signals competence without trying too hard. The brain respects receipts.

5/ Personalization isn’t about first names, it’s about relevance 

Mentioning a hire, a post, or a move they made tells the reader this email escaped the mass-blast factory. Their brain upgrades it from noise to maybe worth reading.

None of this is revolutionary, it’s just psychology applied instead of ignored.

The teams that win at cold email aren’t better writers, they’re better at understanding how humans actually decide to reply.",3,1769021503.0,coldemail,1,1.0,False

So I 23f have never had a boyfriend, no sex, etc (not religious, just didn’t prioritize in high school or college). I’ve tried the apps on two separate occasions (a year a part) and dated guys that I thought would make great longterm partners, but things ended around the 2 month mark for reasons outside of my control.

After having deleted the apps, I’ve decided I don’t really see myself using them ever again due to bad experiences. Things like being over-sexualized, being ghosted, bad communication, withholding information that impacts compatibility (ex. one guy had family that would disown him if we dated (due to race), but didn’t tell me until like 6 dates in lol), etc.

Now that college is over, the window of having consistent access to guys my age is over. Now, I just go to work, hang out with my friends 1-2x per week, and go to the gym. My current hobbies include self studying  Portuguese and Spanish, horseback riding, Pilates, and going to different coffee shops (I’m not a regular anywhere lol). I’m trying to make an effort to have more coed hobbies going forward, so for example, I’ve enrolled in coed soccer. I should also probably mention that I don’t drink, smoke, or go  clubbing. I just don’t have friends that are really into that, so I’ve never gone).

I just feel like outside of the apps, my chances are almost 0%. So, is there anything I’m missing or that I can change about my approach to meeting and dating men? Any other coed activities that I can partake in? I’m not really super pressed to date right now, but if I meet a guy in the wild and thing click, I’m not opposed to pursuing it. I know there’s no pressure, but I would like to make myself more available for it to happen. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",4,1769021496.0,AskWomenNoCensor,11,0.75,False

i know how that sounds. everyone thinks they lost “the one.” that everyone can frame themselves as a victim or a villain depending on the day. and i know that i am the villain in this story. i just need to say my side somewhere it won’t be dissected later or seen by anyone that knows me.

i grew up with rules, but not the kind people expect. there was no yelling, no curfews, no obvious cruelty. everything just came with expectations. dating had to be “serious or nothing.” my feelings were okay, but only if they led somewhere respectable and on the path they laid out for me. i learned early that love was something you earned. by good grades, by following the rules and doing what they wanted.

then i met her by accident. a genuinely stupid accident. i wasn’t looking for anything. we just talked in a group chat about a concert. it was only supposed to be once, we would meet each other and hook up and stay friends. i told myself it was casual because that felt safer. it wasn’t casual. obviously.

she made me feel like i could exist without performing. like i didn’t have to be impressive or planned or good at being an adult. she loved me when i was 17 and dumb and still figuring out who i was, and she never once made me feel like i wasn’t enough. but she was clear that she didn’t want my family’s expectations ruling her life. i didn’t want to lose her. i also didn’t know how to say no.

the closer we got, the louder everything else became. my family. my future. the life that’s been mapped out for me since i was a kid. i kept telling her i would handle it. that i would protect us. that i wouldn’t let them push us into something she didn’t want. i meant it at the time. i really did. but meaning something and doing it aren’t the same, and i failed her in ways i don’t think i’ll ever fully forgive myself for. i couldn’t stand up to them. i couldn’t say no. my family holds my future in their hands, and eventually it felt like i was being forced to choose between her and everything i had been taught to want. and then i did something unforgivable.

i cheated on her. twice. i hate writing that. i hate knowing that if she ever reads this, she’ll see that word and feel it all over again. it was stupid in every possible way. i never should have done it, and i don’t even know why i did. i could have gotten away with it, we were long distance, no one would have known. but i loved her, so i told her. she cried and hung up on me when i told her. and then she still stayed with me anyway when i didn’t deserve her.

that should have been my wake-up call. instead, i doubled down on trying to make everything work, like somehow that would fix anything. i proposed the way my parents wanted me to. we were way too young. i did it way too publicly, in the most cliché way possible. she used to joke that if someone proposed to her a certain place it would be an instant yes, so that’s what i did. it wasn’t romantic. it was pressure and my delusional hope, and i see that now. she said no. she cried. i cried. that should have been the end.

it wasn’t. we did the worst thing possible and stayed in each other’s lives, half together, half apart, constantly hurting each other. i moved states and told myself it was for college, when really i think i just couldn’t stand being somewhere she wasn’t. i convinced myself there would be a take two. that maybe this time we’d get it right.

then she started moving on. going on dates. and then she told me she met someone she really liked. logically, i know she had every right to. emotionally, it felt like being gutted. like the last person who truly knew me and loved me without finally chose something else. someone easier. we got in a huge argument that i started. because i was jealous and still wanted us to work out and i thought maybe she did too. she told me not to contact her ever again and left. i didn’t think she was serious until she didn’t respond to any of my texts.

it’s been almost two years since then. i ran into her once a couple months ago. we talked briefly. it was clipped and i could tell she wanted me to go away. i asked if we could get coffee sometime and talk and she told me that wasn’t a good idea. it hurt but i agree with her. i realized i’m still angry about it all. at her even if i have no right. mostly at myself for turning something i loved so much into something we hated, for hurting her, for believing that love i had to deserve. she’s gone because i fucked up, living with her new girlfriend and posting like they’re the couple of the year. 

i still miss her in a way that feels humiliating. i miss staying up too late just to talk, playing minecraft, watching movies. the nightly phone calls. playing guitar and singing our favorite taylor swift songs together. the way she would pout when she wanted a kiss and i wasn’t paying attention. the way she never asked me for anything except my time and my love.

i’m not writing this for advice. i don’t need to be told i’m young or that there will be other people. i know all of that. i just don’t know how to live with the knowledge that the one person who truly loved me is gone because i didn’t know how to handle it. i’m not asking for sympathy. i know i messed up. i just needed somewhere to say this.

and if you ever read this, i just want you to know: i’m sorry, rosie. i think you were the love of my life. i don’t know if i’ll ever get over you. and i know nothing i say can change the fact that i hurt you.",3,1769021209.0,LesbianActually,5,1.0,False

I'm 19, from the EU, and I'm studying biology at uni. I don’t really have hobbies; all I do is eat, study, sleep, and occasionally wash the dishes. And for those wondering, I barely play video games - maybe a couple of indie games a year and an occasional 2-week Minecraft phase.

I'm quite (maybe a lot) shy. I rarely reach out to people first. I often suffer from anxiety & panic attacks, I have paranoia, I tend to overthink a lot, and I have anger issues - I can get annoyed by basically anything. Why? I don't know\~

I'm introverted and have had a pretty small social circle for several years.

Last time I posted this, I did not include my gender: for those who care I'm male so y'all creeps (you know who you are) stop sending me your ""pics"" in my DMs

I'm looking for people to talk to about random stuff - from +18 to \~20ish\~ years old, ideally uni students in the same or  similar fields. I tend connect best with people who are similar to me personality-wise; I struggle communicating with people who are very different and those convos tend to die instantly & I'd rather avoid that.

I enjoy dark & edgy humor, memes and I love irony. I love arguing with people just to annoy them for no reason whatsoever.

I'm also obsessed with privacy; I don't like talking about my personal life too much so I never give out personal information & I have an unreasonable fear of getting doxxed, so please don't ask <>

!I use arch btw

I’m mostly busy and don't have much free time - I don’t reply immediately, but I will once I'm available. I'm not on my phone 24/7

I'm quite different --I don't enjoy things that most people do so sorry about that. I find it hard to make a list of things that I like/enjoy, so here’s a list of some\* of the things I dislike in no particular order;

Some of them are dealbreakers; I noted those with a \* at the start.

If you have many of them, please save yourself some time and don't bother messaging me.

Our sex life has been fantastic—for one, we both enjoy giving oral more than we like PIV, so most of the time we just take turns going down on each other. Not only do we both prefer it this way, but there’s also no risk of pregnancy and I haven’t been able to get my tubes tied (despite wanting to), so it’s an extra bonus.

Recently my depression med that I’ve been on for 9 years stopped working, so I weaned off and got onto a new one. I tried a couple, and one I was allergic to and the other I had \*awful\* side effects. The one I’m on now is my third try and it is a fucking \*miracle\*. I feel so much better, I have very few negative side effects, I have more energy, I don’t struggle to get things done anymore. It works better than my old one ever did.

Now, among the side effects is dry mouth, and change in taste. There are foods I loved that are I now can’t stand, I’ve changed how I take my coffee, and when I cook I am using significantly less salt and spices. It’s a very noticeable difference.

I also hate how his dick tastes now. The taste of skin makes me gag, and my mouth is so dry that it’s hard to get everything lubricated enough to make giving a blowjob comfortable.

We haven’t really had sex since I started the meds, not because we’re not horny but because neither of us is wild about PIV and I’m not up to giving a bj. We thought maybe the side effects would go away, since apparently some side effects of this med do fade after a few weeks, but we’re well past that window now and no luck. 

He suggested trying a new med so we can have a normal sex life, but fuck. I feel so much better, and finding a good med for mental health is so hard. I feel so good during my daily life and I don’t want to let that go for the small chance that I’ll find something else that works this well.

 

Paul, to his credit, is not pressuring me to blow him. He has however taken offense at me not being willing to explore other meds, since I’m not prioritizing our relationship and sexual compatibility. I get what he’s saying, but I just feel like I should stay on this medication since it’s working. I said we should just do PIV, but he said he doesn’t think it’s fair to ask him to go without blowjobs for an indefinite and potentially decades long time frame.

Download my app here: https://elinestable.com/app 

It was my husband who spotted this trend on social media and let’s just say he’s never the last one to volunteer when it comes to eating brownie 😅😍

In the world of hybrid desserts, it seems brownie and tiramisu are officially having their moment.

This is basically a brownie topped with a layer of tiramisu cream… and it’s ridiculously good. Soft, rich, perfectly chocolatey, ultra fudgy, I was instantly obsessed.

Because the brownie needs to be refrigerated once the tiramisu cream is added, it’s important to slightly underbake it. Otherwise, it can become too dense once chilled. I used my sweet potato brownie base, which has been my go-to for years: reliable, naturally fudgy, and deeply chocolatey ✨

For the tiramisu cream, I went with a quicker version so it can be enjoyed the same day (instead of my usual overnight cream). Both work great, this one is just more impatient-friendly 😄

🌱 Brownimisu 

Brownie

\- 650 g sweet potato

\- 120 g dark chocolate

\- 60 g plant-based margarine

\- 75 g all-purpose flour

\- 1 tbsp cornstarch

\- 4 tbsp light brown sugar

\- 1 pinch flaky salt

Tiramisu cream

\- 100 g cashew nuts

\- 85 ml espresso

\- 1 tsp agar-agar

\- 50 g deodorized coconut oil

\- 65 ml plant-based milk

\- 250 ml plant-based yogurt

\- 3 tbsp sugar

To finish

\- 2 tbsp cocoa powder

Instructions

Soak the cashews in water for 2 hours (or boil them for 8 minutes).

Bake the sweet potato (whole, skin on) at 180°C / 355°F for about 1 hour, until very soft.

Melt the dark chocolate. Scoop out the sweet potato flesh and add it to a blender with the melted chocolate and all remaining brownie ingredients. Blend until smooth.

Line a baking pan with parchment paper, pour in the batter, and bake for 22 minutes at 180°C / 355°F (slightly underbaked is key).

For the cream: set aside 2 tbsp of espresso. Heat the remaining coffee with the agar-agar, whisking constantly. Once it boils, pour it into a blender with the cashews, plant milk, and coconut oil. Blend until very smooth.

In a bowl, whisk the plant-based yogurt with the sugar, then add the cashew mixture and whisk again.

Lightly brush the brownie with the reserved espresso. Pour the tiramisu cream on top and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (up to 24 hours).

My career has been built on **service**. I’ve occupied almost every service-related role possible, giving me a unique ""360-degree"" view of how technology and people intersect.

**My background includes:**

* **Infrastructure & Cloud:** Specialized in Microsoft 365, Azure AD (Entra ID), and Intune/Endpoint management.
* **Data Centers & Hardware:** Experience as a Data Center Technician, handling site security, compliance, and asset management.
* **Support Mastery:** Everything from high-volume call centers (Team Lead roles) to in-house technical support for government contractors and big retail players.
* **Leadership & Grit:** I’ve been a Shift Supervisor/Assistant Manager for a world-renowned coffee chain I know how to handle a ""rush,"" manage a team, and keep customers happy under extreme pressure.

**Roles I’ve crushed in the past:**

* In-house Technical Support Specialist
* Procedure Analyst & Change Management Specialist
* Customer Success / Experience Lead
* Team Lead (Call Center environments)
* Data Center Technician (Compliance & Security)
* Shift Supervisor (Food & Retail)

**RENO, NEVADA /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ January 21, 2026 /** The Board of Directors of Brookmount Gold is pleased to update shareholders on the progress being made at the Company's subsidiary North American Gold's (""NAG"") MooseHorn Gold Project.

The MooseHorn Gold Project located in Yukon; Canada consists of approximately 10,643 acres and includes 234 quartz mineral claims. The property's geological settings are very similar to the extremely productive locations nearby; Coffee Creek, Pogo and Fort Knox. The most recent NI 43-101 prepared by Stantec Group, confirmed inferred resources of 39,040 ounces of gold, which at current market prices, equates to approximately $190 million. NAG has ordered an update to the existing NI 43-101 and expects its completion in the coming days.

NAG is completing the positioning of heavy equipment on site including excavators, dozers and dump trucks during the winter months while march access roads are frozen solid. The Moose Horn Gold Project is equipped with established camp facilities, light vehicles including pickup trucks and ATVs and a current fuel inventory of over 37,000 gallons. Most importantly, the property has a reliable water source, and all needed water licenses are in place.

MooseHorn's historical gold production is impressive with approximately 65,640 ounces of placer gold produced since 1978. It's No.1 vein sampling in 1993 averaging 2.2oz per ton. A 24-ton bulk sample from V1 returned 1.8oz per ton. These results and more confirm the presence of ""high grade"" gold bearing quartz veins.

Errin Kimball, Chief Geologist of North American Gold, commented: ""With the pre-positioning of the of all the heavy equipment and needed materials on site and planning the first runs in the early spring, I am very excited to see the first bucket of ore hit the hooper. We are positioning this Company to be a powerhouse in the Gold Mining community, with the Moose Horn Gold Project to start production in the spring with our 2 Alaskan properties to follow.""",1,1769020052.0,Pennystock,1,1.0,False

I analyzed 50 videos I posted that should have done better but died between 700 and 1.4k views. Every single one had at least three of these six problems. Once I learned what to look for, my hit rate went from one in ten videos working to about seven out of ten.

Here's what's killing videos that should perform:

**Your hook promises something but you don't deliver it until way too late**

This ruined 40 out of 50 videos. Hook would say something like ""biggest lesson I learned"" but I wouldn't say what the lesson was until second 29. 75% of people left before I mentioned the actual lesson. If your hook promises something and you don't give it by second 9 to 12, people think you're stalling. I moved the reveal in one video from second 27 to second 10. Went from 700 views to 28k.

**You pause too long and people assume it ended**

Found this in 30 videos. I'd stop talking for 1.9 seconds to breathe and people thought the video was over. One video had a 2.1 second gap at second 13 and lost 68% of viewers at that exact moment. Pauses longer than 1.5 seconds make people think something broke.

**The same visual sits there too long**

This killed 26 videos. I'd show the same shot for 9+ seconds while narrating and people's focus died. One video kept the same angle from second 10 to second 19 and lost 59% during that stretch. If nothing changes on screen for over 6 seconds people get bored.

**You say something mid video that sounds like a conclusion**

Caught this in 18 videos. I'd use phrases like ""so that's what matters"" when I had more to say after. People interpreted that as me wrapping up and left. If you're not done, don't use ending words.

**Your best point is buried too far in**

This happened in 34 videos. I'd save my strongest insight for the end but by the time I got there at second 28, everyone except my most patient viewers was gone. Better approach is leading with your strongest point around second 11 to 15, then next strongest, then weakest. Rearranged one video this way. Went from 1.3k to 26k views.

**Second 6 to 13 doesn't match what the hook showed**

Showed up in 22 videos. Hook would be about one specific thing but then I'd pivot to background instead of just showing the thing. Like hook says ""this changed everything"" but second 7 to 14 talks about why change is hard instead of showing what changed. People came for what you promised in the first 5 seconds.

It really helped to use an app that shows what's wrong with your videos and exactly how to fix them to get more views. I use one called Tik'Alyzer and it shows the exact second people leave and why they left. Like it'll point out second 17 has dead air and 65% dropped there, or you don't deliver your hook until second 24 when most people left at second 12. Standard analytics show numbers without showing you what to fix.

Once I started catching these six things before posting, my dead video rate dropped from like 90% to around 30%. Still post videos that don't hit but now I understand why instead of blaming the algorithm.

If you've got videos stuck under 2k that you thought were decent, look for these six things. At least three are probably there.",5,1769020000.0,learnTikTok,1,0.86,False

Date - October 11th , 2019

Place - Revere PD crime lab

After getting a call that the DNA results from the pussy blood found at both scenes has come back, Murphy and Corso are meeting with Revere police department forensics expert Jenna Bosco. Bosco is 24 years old, has blonde hair and blue eyes, cute with an athletic figure. Since joining the department, she has quickly become Murphy’s go to analyst due to her expertise and undeniable skills.

With coffee in hand both detectives step into the elevator to the basement, which had recently been upgraded into a full scale crime lab. The elevator door opens, Murphy instinctively places his arm over the threshold to hold the door for Corso as he steps out.  Murphy watches the tall young detective stride forward. He thinks about the first time he met him back when Corso was just a rookie filled with piss and vinegar. Murphy often tells the kid how he reminds him of himself when he was that old. Corso made the jump to detective as fast as anybody in the department. Murphy even vouched for him and helped push his promotion through, in hopes he would be able to mentor him before he retired in the next few years. The detectives walk briskly down the hall and hit the buzzer to enter, the glass doors slide open and they walk into the lab. Murphy bellows, ""Hey Bosco, give me some good news, we could use a win here...whaddya got?""

Bosco looks up from her monitor as Murphy and Corso walk between the desks inside the lab and gets up to meet them halfway. With a sarcastic tone, she quips while greeting the detectives, “Before we get to that...Murphy you look like absolute shit. When was the last time you got some sleep? She then turns her attention to Corso who is barely older than she is, ""And for fucks sake Corso, they haven't fired you yet?""

Corso laughs out loud sarcastically, then loudly sips his coffee and replies, ""My gainful employment is a mystery to us all... still good to see you too Jenna.”

Murphy gestures to the blood samples on the table in front of him while laughing as well but is here to get down to business. ""OK enough fucking around..I bet Corso 12 bucks it was pussy blood we found at both scenes...one of us is going to be right and one is going to eat some crow. Now it's time to pay up for one of us. Was I right or wrong? You know I can smell a drop of poon-aid in a raging river from 250 yards away.""

Bosco rolls her eyes at Murphy long enough to stop laughing and puts on her professional face before answering, ""I don't know how you knew but you're right Murphy. The darkfield microscope the captain got for us is amazing. Not only is it able to tell us everything about the blood that we want to know, like blood type, presence of drugs or alcohol, but in this case I could see there were skin cells from when the uterine wall sheds. This is 100% the blood from a pussy…from the looks of it she is a gusher too.""

Corso smile fades into a look of defeat, he shakes his head slowly in disbelief, ""No fucking way.""

Murphy triumphantly raises his arms above his head, imitating a touchdown, and laughs. He puts out his hand, palm up, gesturing towards the center. “C'mon Corso...12 bucks? Pay up.. a bet is a  bet.""

Corso hangs his head before he pulls his wallet out and hands over 12 singles. ""You know I was saving that money for this years Twerkathon at Tidday's."" 

Murphy sips his coffee. ""Ok Bosco..so we got a match? Who is she?""

Bosco replies quickly. ""Got no clue, she doesn't match anybody in our database. But there's more, the blood came from two different visits from aunt flow…""

Murphy is now the one with the look of amazement. ""Two different batches, how can you tell?"" 

Bosco walks over to her laptop and opens a small file. “See here. The skin cells that are present are aged differently, they break down over time like anything else. We can see the difference and get a time frame. The source of this blood came from the same woman but nearly a year apart as best we can tell.""

Murphy responds like a man who has been married for more than 20 years.”Are you telling me our killer is a woman and once she is on the rag she becomes a killer?""

Bosco laughs at how simple Murphy is. “No, no way it is a woman unless she can bench press Corso. The stab wounds on Finn didn't just hit soft tissue. The autopsy showed the knife got stuck in bone on at least three separate thrusts. Whoever killed Finn was pretty damn strong, a retard possibly. In any case you are probably looking for a guy who goes to the gym a lot.""

Corso utters. ""A football player?""

Bosco thinks about it for a second. “Possibly and he is around eight or nine nine-inch dicks tall, based on the angle of the wounds. These came in a downward motion."" Bosco picks up a pen and  demonstrates the swinging motion she believes was used. ""Then on Clausen, the blunt force trauma to the head was strong enough to shatter his cranium."" 

Murphy giggles at the unit of measurement Bosco chose. “Wait, did you just use a nine-inch dick as a unit of measurement? “

Bosco pulls up six separate images of skulls on a wall screen and without a pause says, “A girls gotta have her standards.”

Murphy looks down at his own crotch, shrugs his shoulders and says, “Fair play.”

Bosco continues to display the forensic photos from her files. “This one here is Clausen, you can see how the skull was crushed, leading to massive hemorrhaging.”

Murphy walks closer to the wall screen and points, ""What about this one?""

Bosco replies  ""That guy fell off his roof and landed on his head from about 21 nine-inch dicks up, he died on impact.""

Corso blushes, he is unwilling to even question how she arrived at this new system. He chooses instead to move on and then inquires about the next images, ""And these two? Holy shit it looks like someone hit them with a sledgehammer.”

Bosco nods her head. “Funny you should mention that. This is the skull of coach Gillbride.""

Murphy's voice has a touch of wonder in it, ""Kevin Gilbride? Didn't he get punched in the face by Buddy Ryan during a game once?""

Bosco laughs ""I'm not old enough to remember Murph. He died a few years ago in a pregame football stunt gone wrong.""

Corso excitedly responds, ""Fuck me, I remember that. He was coaching up in Buffalo and they paid Cannon Balls to come throw out the ceremonial first pass. Gilbride was wearing a helmet cam…craziest shit I ever saw. The ball hit him dead in the face, but he held on to it..was a helluva catch."" 

Bosco replies, ""Yeah, that was it. Even though he caught it, the ball still hit his face. Went right through the face mask and stuck in his skull. Catastrophic trauma killed him instantly.""

Murphy expresses clear admiration for the retired quarterback ""Man, Balls could really spin it..can't believe he managed to hold on to it. I watched that replay about 60 times.""

Corso shows deference to the deceased. ""Damn right he did...dude was a soldier. Anyway, what were you saying Bosco?""

Bosco jokingly replies, ""Now that you two are done with your hero worship. I was  saying whoever did this used pussy blood from the same woman with a bled on date more than 2 years apart.""

Murphy is unable to hide his shock. ""Mother fucker.. this is worse than I thought..we got a real sick son of a bitch on our hands here.""",1,1769019954.0,story,0,1.0,False
1qj5u8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1qj5u8p/aitj_for_telling_my_friend_to_stop_using_my_name/,AITJ for telling my friend to stop using my name in his pitches and “reviews” when I only gave casual advice?,"I’m 33F. A friend from college (32M) has been trying to launch a small B2B software thing for about a year. I’m a product designer and I’ve helped a few friends sanity-check ideas, so when he asked if we could grab coffee and talk through his onboarding flow, I said sure. It was one normal conversation, maybe 90 minutes. I gave feedback like “this screen is confusing” and “your pricing page reads scammy”, and that was it. I didn’t join anything, didn’t take equity, didn’t agree to be an advisor, nothing. A couple weeks later he texts me a PDF like “look at the deck!!” and on one slide it says “Advisors” and my full name is there. Not “Sarah from college”, my actual name. Under it, a little line that implies I’m helping guide the product. I told him to remove it. He replied “it’s just social proof, relax, everyone does it. It’s not like I’m using your face.” I got annoyed but stayed calm and said it’s still not true, and it makes me look like I’m endorsing something I barely know. He said okay and sent a new version without that slide.

Fast forward to last weekend. I’m at a local tech meetup (small city, people overlap). A guy comes up to me and goes, “Oh you’re working with (friend’s name) right? I saw you listed as an advisor on his one pager.” I felt my stomach drop. Later I asked my friend to show me what he’s handing out. On his website there’s a section “What people say” with 3 quotes, and one of them is basically my wording from coffee, but rewritten as a glowing testimonial, with my name under it. Another place had “Backed by industry experts” and again, my name. I called him and said remove my name everywhere today. He got defensive and said I’m being dramatic and “making it personal”, and that he needs to look legit because investors keep ghosting him. He also said since I did give him advice, it’s not a lie, it’s “based on real feedback.” I said advice is not endorsement, and I don’t consent to being used as marketing. He then accused me of trying to sabotage his launch out of jealousy (??) and said if I make him delete it now he’ll “look shady” because people already saw it. I told him if it stays up I’m going to correct anyone who asks and be honest that I’m not involved, and I’ll tell him who I told. He thinks that’s a threat and that I’m a jerk for not letting him “borrow” credibility when it costs me nothing. I don’t want to ruin him, I just don’t want my name attached to something I didn’t agree to.

TL;DR: Friend used my name as an “advisor” and as a testimonial without permission after one casual coffee. I demanded he remove it everywhere and said I’ll correct people if he doesn’t. AITJ?

Hi Reddit,

I’m a Montreal-based IT professional with 8+ years of experience, and I’m currently looking for my next challenge. I’m not just looking for a paycheck I’m looking for an employer who operates by their guiding principles and a role where I can make a real impact.

My career has been built on **service**. I’ve occupied almost every service-related role possible, giving me a unique ""360-degree"" view of how technology and people intersect.

**My background includes:**

* **Infrastructure & Cloud:** Specialized in Microsoft 365, Azure AD (Entra ID), and Intune/Endpoint management.
* **Data Centers & Hardware:** Experience as a Data Center Technician, handling site security, compliance, and asset management.
* **Support Mastery:** Everything from high-volume call centers (Team Lead roles) to in-house technical support for government contractors and big retail players.
* **Leadership & Grit:** I’ve been a Shift Supervisor/Assistant Manager for a world-renowned coffee chain I know how to handle a ""rush,"" manage a team, and keep customers happy under extreme pressure.

**Roles I’ve crushed in the past:**

* In-house Technical Support Specialist
* Procedure Analyst & Change Management Specialist
* Customer Success / Experience Lead
* Team Lead (Call Center environments)
* Data Center Technician (Compliance & Security)
* Shift Supervisor (Food & Retail)

**Why me?** I don’t just ""fix"" things; I take ownership. I love thinking outside the box to find creative ways to gain efficiency, improve workflows, and automate the boring stuff (PowerShell/Python). I bring the discipline of a business owner/freelance with the hands-on empathy of a front-line service worker.

I am fully bilingual (FR/EN), technically certified (AZ-900, Cisco CyberOps), and ready to start immediately.

If your company values integrity, proactive problem-solving, and efficiency, **DM me.** Let’s see where this takes us!",1,1769019904.0,montrealjobs,2,1.0,False

I have been married one year and I had my first child in the first year. She is now 4 months. After I was able to have sex we have been having sex at least 2-3 times a week every week which I think is reasonable since I work from home plus some days I work from home with my daughter sometimes if she’s not with her grandma. Also I cook about 3-4 times a week sometimes more and I am a part time college student. When I say this is the busiest season of my life it so busy like I’m up running from the time I wake up around 4 am sometimes mostly 6 am until about 11 pm or later. My husband thinks we don’t have enough sex but with my hectic schedule I think 2-3 times a week is reasonably also he says we always do it when I feel like it which I agree but it’s only because I am so busy and he approaches me at the most inconvenient times also I do most of the domestic work and I am trying my best to be a great wife but he is making me feel so bad about it. Also we try to keep it spicy by doing car sex beach etc but it still doesn’t seem to be working. I started a new semester of school just two weeks ago and I told him how school adds to my stress and sex may not be so frequent or as spicy he said okay. I had a bad week and so sexually I was not present and we only had sex once last week which is a rare occasion unless I am sick or he is sick. He got mad and ended up watching porn mind you he told me he would not watch porn anymore. Also I have not let myself go I still have my hourglass figure and i work out at home since I have not officially returned to the gym and I have a decent diet. Also we are a Christian couple and we agree porn is a no in our marriage. I don’t watch porn at all and it really upsets me that one bad week made him go to porn bc I am stressed with everything I have on my plate. Also I have his coffee ready in the morning he rarely has to fix his on plate I give massage etc and I want to serve him and I love serving him but I am so heartbroken that he cannot give me grace when I have a bad week or days like I do for him. Am I being unreasonable? I think sex 2-3x a week with everything I have on my plate right now is reasonable especially with a 4 month old baby. I feel like I’m doing my best but my husband is making me feel like I am not. Idk what to do….also I don’t expect us to have sex 2-3x a week forever. Of course the goal is to always have more sex but for this current stage in our lives I feel that is reasonable. Basically I am so tired some days that 2-3x a week is the best I can do for real. I wish I had the energy to have more sex right now but some days I am so exhausted 😭",9,1769019840.0,Marriage,65,0.66,False

""Now that's just rude. Most folk in your position would say thanks."" He snarked. 

""Thanks."" The dirty blonde replied as she jammed the gun in the side of his skull. ""Now drive on down the road till I tell you."" she demanded. 

""Hold on now, think a wire got crossed here. You know where the rest of these fools are hold up?"" Travis demanded.

""I remember the way back, yes."" She admitted through gritted teeth. Travis slapped the wheel and horse laughed.

""Well then why the hell are wasting time with this pissing contest here, let's go get em-put that lil pop gun down."" He laid the charm on thick. She hesitated but lowered the pistol slightly.

Every instinct Travis had told him to grab it from her and bash her head in for even looking at it in his presence. He ignored those thoughts, at least until he got a grasp on whatever the hell was happening around here.

He started up the engine which purred like a newborn kitten. The jeep bolted forward, Travis could feel every bump on the jaded edge on the road. They sat in silence for a bit, each sizing up the other.

The dirty blonde looked to be in her early 20s-Travis had noticed a northern accent to her tone, Maine maybe. He had never met someone from Maine he didn't want to throttle. It seemed that tradition would hold fast. She has some light bruising on her arms and neck, but other than that she seemed in better shape than her fellow escapee. 

""Did you see anyone else out there?"" she inquired, startling Travis. 

""Talking bout that long haired pot belly fella, right? The New blood? Yeah, I found him-don't know what they did to him, but he died from his wounds. Buried him. Followed his trail."" He lied. 

""Fucking savages."" The dirty blonde muttered to herself. The car was greeted with silence once more, save for the occasional thump in the road. Travis could sense the fury boiling over from the passenger seat.

""Did you know him?"" He asked, trying to be pleasant. 

""Not really. They thought I was newly turned, that I had no control over the change. I got the drop on them, took out a few of the guards, he broke loose in the chaos. We went our separate ways. Never even got his name."" she said solemnly. 

""How long since you've been afflicted?"" Travis cracked. The dirty blonde shrugged. 

""Never was. I was born a freak."" she replied casually. Travis dropped his jester's smile at that. 

""No shit. My mas-the one who turned me- he said there were no pure bloods left in the states. Says they were all hunted down during the great purge."" He said bewildered. The dirty blonde looked at him cross-eyed. 

""Yeah-I guess not."" She shifted uncomfortably.  A newfound tension joined the cunning silence as they came to a fork in the road. The dirty blonde pointed left down a rocky road that had no trespassing sign out front. Travis cleared his throat as he made the turn.

""Look, we got off on the wrong foot here. My name's Travis."" He introduced himself. 

""Tammy."" she replied coolly. ""I don't know a whole lot about this group. They're held up in a bunker; there's a big cabin that serves as a front-I assume anyway. I don't know how many there are, but counting the two you got they're down about seven or eight people."" She informed. Travis gave her a nod

""Any advantage is a good one. How long they have you down there?""

""About a week. My own fault. Someone jabbed me from behind and I blacked out. When I came to, I saw- I'm not sure exactly. It looked like one of us, smelled like us. But it was older, and bigger than this jeep. I could feel his pain; it was radiating in waves off him from all the gunk and wires they pumped into him."" she said. Travis gripped the wheel in response.

 ""They injected me with some of his blood. Funky feeling but it didn't really have any effect on me. So, they locked me away with the others. None of them seemed to have been turned for more than a month, maybe two tops. They took five or six away to the back before I broke out. I don't know what happens back there but-It smells like death and ashes."" She shuddered at the memory of the dank bunker, and the stench of decay that surrounded it. Tammy eyed Travis with renewed suspicion. ""What are you doing out here anyway? I kind of find it hard to believe I'd run into someone else like me."" 

""Heh, I was up here on what you might call a spiritual retreat."" Travis beamed. He rolled the word ""Spiritual"" on his tongue-like it was his favorite word in the world. ""Tonight's the blood moon after all."" he said with reverence.

""Oh yeah, something to do with dust in the Earth's atmosphere reflecting light or something like that. My Bio professor mentioned something about it last week."" she remarked.  Now it was Travis who met her with a peculiar look.

""My word, woman, don't you know your own history?"" He scoffed. ""Why you're a god among these heathens?"" He sneered at her. They came to another left turn filled with foliage and muddled with tracks. He took it sharply, the whole jeep rumbling as he narrowed his eyes at her. 

""I mean I know what my mother told me about us-"" She started but Travis waved his hand dismissively.

""Nah, you don't know- I can tell by your voice. It was centuries ago, when our people didn't hide away in the dark. The lunar father loved all who dwelt under the moonlight but favored the cunning wolf. The wolf was strong and fierce but still suffered under the yolk of man's eternal hunt.""

""This angered the celestial above so much that he turned sanguine from rage-the great plains became marked with crimson as all of creation trembled in awe. Under this blood moon a den mother bore a litter under the merciful gaze of the lunar lord. One of these pups stood tall among his brothers, blessed with all the strengths of a wolf- yet walked like a man, thought like a man, could hunt like one.""

"" He was the first of his kind; his bite spread among the heathens, blessing the unenlightened with the mark of the lunar god's love."" Travis beamed as he spun his tale. Tammy shifted closer to the window, feigning a pleasant smile as she nodded her head along to the bizarre folklore he spoke of. 

""-All wolves are descended from the line of Varcolac, though he is known by many names. He was the first prophet, the first son of the moon. It doesn't surprise me your history is lost to you. My mentor knew all too well of the false god's suppression of our heritage."" Travis sneered. 

""Right. Well, my mother always told me something different, less-biblical I suppose."" She said with caution. The jeep was silent as it rolled down the road. Tammy looked out the window, recognizing the claw stripped bark and bullet holes decorating the trees. They were getting close.

""Out of curiosity, what fairy tales did your mother teach you?"" Travis pondered aloud, almost daring her to contradict him.

""A man was jealous of his brother, he had a bigger house, beautiful wife and the most plentiful herd in the village. One day his temper and jealousy got the better of him, and he slaughtered his brother and his family in cold blood. They say the gods were so horrified by the man's crimes they cursed him to forever walk the earth as a beast, never to know peace as he was forever plagued by hunter's arrows. He spread his curse across the land because-misery loves company I suppose. A few hundred years later here I am."" she finished. Travis scoffed at this.

 ""Is that how you see it; a blight over a divine blessing?"" He sneered, hands clenching the wheel.

 ""I wouldn't say blight-more like a livable curse."" She eased. 

""Agree to disagree."" Travis replied through gritted fangs. He would massacre the heretic later, when the humans had been dealt with. Perhaps the pure blood would make an ideal offering to the night orb above.

\------------

The jeep rolled to a crawl as a cabin came into view. There were three other jeeps parked out front sans drivers. The sun cast a low shadow on the sleepy cabin, yet no lights could be seen inside. A worn stone chimney rested on the side, wafts of smoke drifting into the sky.

The cabin roof was covered with shingles-rusty and burdened by the harsh weather. It was quiet and unassuming, not even a cricket dared chirp near it. Tucked away in the porch was a faint but obvious red dot. It flashed occasionally, the old-fashioned security camera pointing directly out into the clearing.

Lucky for the wolves they had pulled aside-they had not yet been seen by the cameras. The jeep idled on the side of the dissolute dirt road as they pondered their options. The sun was low now, draping a haunting silhouette on the cabin-like it was beckoning them inside.  Travis cleared his throat and turned to Tammy. 

""We move in the cover of darkness, under the gaze of the Bloodmoon."" he proclaimed. Tammy couldn't argue, they were probably on high alert with the escape. The last thing they would expect would be an assault on their stronghold. ""Would you care to join me in prayer as we prepare for battle and for the righteous change under the holy light?"" he spoke with reverence, eager to convert her. 

""I'm- not right now, I prefer to be alone for-that."" She stammered. Travis sneered for a second, his face twisting in fury. But he calmed himself, and quoted scripture at her as he left the driver's side. 

""The prophets say *""We bring the call of the wild to the sign of the sacristy/ Rest in the eye of our sanctity""*\- It is our duty as children of the moon to bring our light to those who have none. Consider that, my sister, as the night approaches."" With that he slinked off into the brush to grovel in worship of the sanguine moon, leaving Tammy there to wonder why the hell this nut job just quoted a metal band like they were the words of God.

\-----------

Tammy eyed Travis like a hawk as he kneeled before the coming moon. His arms were outstretched to the sky in praise as he mumbled prayers for forgiveness and servitude. She bounced her knees nervously. Whatever whacked out cult he belonged to skeeved the hell out of her.

She recalled her mother's own beliefs. She always thought it funny a werewolf would be such a devout catholic, but she supposed God had a sense of humor about that sort of thing. Every Sunday she would get dragged to mass, always getting an itching feeling when it fell on the day of a full moon.

Tammy enjoyed it however, everyone there was always so welcoming and kind. It was a nice reprieve from the schoolyard bullies. It had been sometime since she had said a prayer, and the thought flew across her mind like a bow in the wind. She brushed it off, almost embarrassed at the thought though she wasn't sure why.

She began to feel the weight of the rising star herself. She had resisted the call of the full moon most of her life-her mother had taught her to suppress her beastly urges well. She had never liked the change-the tearing of her skin to reveal a ghastly monster underneath.

But she had come to terms with it long ago- had never lost control of the wolf and rampaged into the night. Last night was the first time she had ever killed anyone. She could recall the taste of fear in their blood and could still hear the snapping of bones under her maw. It frightened her how easy it had been. Just like it frightened her how easy the crazed stranger had slaughtered those two guards to free her.

She furrowed her brow at the thought- no that scum needed to die, she was at peace with that part. She hated them for forcing her hand, and she was still furious at herself for getting caught. She was never much for the wilderness, preferring the chaotic comfort of the city.

 This morning, she was dazed and half naked, a winning combo for being lost in the woods.

She had heard the hunters coming this time and managed to hide from them at first. Or so she thought, as she was caught off guard by the zip of a tranq gun from nowhere. She had drifted off into the abyss, and woken up in the back of a jeep to the sound of two bickering hunters.  She was a poor wolf it seemed, least in the eyes of the mad man Travis. When they had freed the people below, she suspected she would have to be quick in her getaway.

As the night circled them, the moon above grew bold and bright-a ghastly shade of ember red coming down to greet them. Tammy held her breath and embraced the change-her world spinning as the wolf clawed at her mind. Travis basked in the celestial body's glow; he was nude and kneeling in muck, but he felt the loving embrace of God greeting him.

He opened his eyes cautiously, like he was afraid he would be deemed unworthy to gaze upon the blood-moon that night. The stars danced before him, the burning crimson wolf above looking straight back at him. He could feel the god speaking In his mind, it told him he was proud of Travis- he was a good son and soon enough his purpose would become clear.

With tears in his ocher eyes, he thanked the lord above and began the change. It felt different than usual, purer and more carnal. He tore the mortal skin from his body, arms morphing and growing as he became more bestial. Leathery skin with thick black fur took its place as he tore away at what remained of his humanity.

A few feet away from him the jeep rumbled and rattled as Tammy cried out, gums gushing blood as fangs tore through them. She bucked and kicked the dashboard, denting it as her cries became guttural and ravenous. The pain fried her senses; she could feel her mind breaking apart as the hunger of the wolf consumed her.

Travis never broke away from the moon's gaze as he grew and changed, foaming at the maw as he barked at the moon with joy. His lips curled in a smile as his snout enlarged, and he howled at the moon with vigor as he felt the nub of a tail form near his lower back.

Tammy bust out of the jeep, her frame leaner than his, more agile than his hulking physique. Her fur was a golden tint-eyes burning like fire in the night sky. She huffed and puffed as she clawed at the ground, fingernails still bleeding from the fresh change. She tasted iron in her mouth, and she salivated at the sensation.

Travis stood tall, a hulking eight feet at least, yet still hunched over as he lumbered over to the struggling Tammy. She stood up, about seven feet and snarled at the approaching black wolf. Travis made a deep clicking sound, like a dog trying to laugh. He spoke then-his voice graveled and deep, like he was speaking with rocks in his throat.

 ""Calm your senses sister. You neglect your real self-that much is obvious."" He said with a hint of disdain. Tammy ignored his remark and eyed the cabin. She pointed a gnarled claw at it.

""Want-their flesh-free-o-thers."" She choked out her command. Travis faced the cabin, the words of his god flooding his mind.

""You are chosen Travis-never forget that you're better than the roaches. Go and teach them the folly of their sin."" His master cooed in his ear. 

""Thy will be done."" Travis muttered to himself. He surged forward on all fours, lunging at the front door. The door was flimsy wood and rusted hinges; he tore through it and lumbered into the dark cabin. Tammy followed behind, her mind muddled and falling to instinct. She was not used to changing at the height of the cycle.

\------------

The inside of the cabin was small, claustrophobic even for the wolves. The walls were barre- rooms filled with boxes and dusty hunting trophies littered the place. It reeked of musk and mold, dust dancing in the moonlight as the patrolled. Deep from below, Travis heard a ringing- an alarm blaring and the thunderous sounds of panicked steps.

Tammy sniffed some boxes, a stuffed deer head pointing out of them. It stared at them with the lifeless eyes of a doll. In the corner was a bookcase, scuff marks in front of it. Travis sneered as he approached, grabbing hold of the case and ripping it out of the wall. Machinery ached and sparked as he tore it away and threw it against the bony cabin wall.

Hidden behind was a short hallway illuminated with fluorescent lights. An elevator stood tall at the end. The wolves rushed forward, the tortured cries of their brethren crying out for them. They sounded confused and afraid, surrounded by deadly silver and men with weapons. Tammy reached out towards the elevator, and with a grunt cracked open the sliding doors.

They cried out in pain, a horrid screech like metal pushing against metal. They looked down to see a shallow shaft. Far below the elevator roared to life, ascending to meet them. Travis jumped forward, clinging to the shaft with a clang. Tammy followed suit and the wolves skated down, using their claws to hug the walls, tearing into paneling and sparking wires as they descended.

They were gaining speed, the elevator fast approaching. With a huff he leapt from the hoist way and landed on the roof, shaking the roof of the elevator with fury. It halted to a dead stop, groans of a dying machine echoing out. From inside the cart Travis heard panicked murmurs and shouts. He could smell them through the oil and rust of the elevator. The stench of body spray and silver clung to them like ticks.

Travis grimaced and swiped at the ceiling hatch to the shocked gasps of the men trapped inside. From inside they could see the hulking outline of the beast with beady yellow eyes and a mouth full of glistening teeth that seemed to stretch for miles. They met him with gunfire, Travis roared and ducked back behind the motor as they fired. Bullets zipped through the air-viscous little silver streaks.

He lurched back towards the hatch as they reloaded and reared his head inside. The elevator was crowded, five men security gear-vests and tactical gas masks like they were handling chemicals all day. The bald one in the corner reached for his side arm-but Travis' reach was quicker and longer. He snagged the man-who howled as claws dug into his chest. Travis greedily tore into the man's face and tossed him aside, the still squirming body shaking the ground on impact.

Travis slithered into the elevator, mouthwatering as the dead men inside screamed and fired. Tammy watched the cart quiver with violence as Travis butchered them, the sounds of meat tearing apart and scattered gunfire. Bullets flew through the shaft, dinging the walls as they came to a sparking stop.

The light inside had an orange hue to it-it lights up the shaft like a blood-soaked jack-o-lantern. As the screaming died down and was replaced with gluttonous feeding, a bloodied man scurried up the top of the hatch. His face was caked in gore, his dull blue eyes dancing around the dank shaft.

His name was David-a middle-aged man who had misgivings about what they did there-yet didn't lift a finger to stop it. He gasped for bloodless air; Travis was gnawing on a femur, oblivious to the escapee. If he could climb the wiring-maybe he would live to see dawn.

On the wall beside him he heard hot, wheezing breath.

He trembled; he turned to see ember eyes staring back at him- a slender figure glued to the wall on all fours. The beast's mouth stank of dry tuna and wet dog-it panted at him, eyeing him like a slab of steak. David was frozen with fright; he could feel warmth pooling down his leg.

The beast with flamed eyes seemed to unhinge its jaw, slowly grasping his scalp around it. He could feel rows of teeth begging to clamp down on his skull, nipping at the edge of his skin. Fresh blood dripped down his head-his vision became blurry with crimson ichor. There was a pounding pressure on his skull, like his head was splitting open.

As the wolf's jaws clamped down-sinking into the bone and brain matter-he had a final spasm as his eyes rolled back, and David browned out as the maw tightened. His ear drums popped and crackled from pressure-fluid filling them as the beast crunched down. Its powerful jaws were like a bear trap, slowly crushing his skull as David was in excruciating pain every millisecond.

A pinkish-gray goo spilled out of his nose-he tried to speak but found himself sputtering and babbling. His vision became further obscured by crimson and the abyss-a crunch rang out- and he was gone. 

A headless corpse fell to the floor-interrupting Travis' banquet. He tossed aside a gnawed forearm still gripping a broken pistol as he listened to the frenzied chewing above. Splintered bone flew down-the marrow licked clean as Tammy hacked and clawed at her prize. She crawled down, savoring her kill like a dog proud of her chew toy.

\-------------

Travis stood hunched in the car, lights dull and orange like a dying flame. He was surprised at the animalistic behavior of one who claimed to be a wolf her whole life. Then again, she clearly despised this side of herself, perhaps she was out of practice. He kneeled down to commune with her, hoping to convey some sort of plan or at least keep her from swallowing the hunk of bone whole. Tammy pulled away from him-snarling like he was going to try and take what remained of the skull.

""Bah."" He spat. ""Choke on it then."" He eyed the control panel and batted it with his gnarled hand. The elevator lurched downward, the only sounds were the chokes of Tammy spitting out bone. She stood among the gore, gathering her thoughts.

\------------

The lights so vivid-smells so clear. She wanted to hunt, needed to hunt-needed to feed.

No, no she had a mission she needed to focus. The tall wolf stood near; he reeked of death. He seemed annoyed by her-this was no good, he was strong, a fighter-she needed to do better to please hi-

no NO- what was she saying, she was Tamara-Tamara Talbot, she wasn't an animal, she wasn't a wolf. She was something in between, she wasn't a slave to her instincts. Lights dimmed, the cart grinded to a halt. She took deep breaths.

The room smelled of food-she was hungry she-

she had killed someone, someone who was trying to hurt her; maybe? She struggled to remember, struggled to think-to be rational. She stood tall, back legs shaking like a newborn deer as she pushed the animal back.

She snarled at the tall wolf as the elevator doors opened. She pushed past him, the white halls blinding. A dull light kept going on and off, and she winced and whined as a shrill sound blared overhead. The tall wolf grimaced next to her, swiping at something above their heads. It collapsed to the ground in a heap as the shrill sound faded. She eyed him, grunting in gratitude. She cleared her throat, struggling to find the words.

""Th-is way-big-like us."" She struggled. Travis got the gist of it.

\------------

He stepped over the shattered intercom-the alarm still blaring throughout the facility.  The walls were labeled with colored lines: green, blue and red. The green line led to a double door labeled ""kennels."" While the blue led to a sealed metal door to their left. The red line followed the green like a somber companion. Travis stomped towards the blue line door as an intercom rattled to life in the distance. A commanding voice sounded off in the distance.

 ""This is Abbott-lock down the kennel and prepare purge protocol! This is not a drill!"" His voice echoed throughout the bunker. Travis put aside the word ""purge"" for a moment as he stood before the metal door. There was a port hole in the front, it was more like a pressurized bulkhead. Through the porthole he could see a massive thing in there, heaving its body through labored breaths.

He opened the door, it swung heavy, grinding like it wanted to hide away the shame. He crept forward, the muffled wheeze of the great wolf before him filled the void of silence. Tammy wasn't lying-the great beast was at least the size of a hummer. Yet it was lanky and emaciated-its skin dry and cracked. Its grey fur was frayed and weathered-like he was in the final stages of mange. His chest was pock marked and covered in cysts and sickly liver spots.

The great wolf was muzzled- ears clipped and forced to wear blinders like a racehorse. Countless wires and tubes were stuck in him, coiled around the great one like hungry vipers. Machines pumped and whirred sucking the life force from it and recycling back into him.

Around him was an assortment of tools and medical equipment used to poke, prod and bleed the wolf. Travis stood before the elder trembling with rage. He reached out towards the wheezing thing as the equipment beeped and breathed-attempting to remove the blinders.

They came off easy, the elder didn't even register. His eyes a pure milky cloud, gunk crusting up around them in a sickly manner. Travis put his hands on the elder's head. It flinched at his touch, rambling against its shackles. He soothed the beast, taking his head in his hands carefully. He felt so frail, Travis smelt longing and aged cruelty on the great beast-who knows how long he had wasted away in the dark?

The great beast moaned in agony-and Travis knew what must be done.

Tamara entered the room just in time to see Travis grab a silver laden tool off a table and ram it swiftly into the elder's skull. Steam poured from his hand as he twisted the tool, the great beast struggling for only a moment. The equipment keeping the ancient wolf alive cried out in mourning as Travis embraced him, feeling the life drain away as the elder went limp in his arms.

When the beast had passed-he threw the murder weapon aside, his hand still steaming and burnt. He laid the creature to rest on the floor, cradling the head like a child with his toy. Tammy cried out at the murder, a sharp bark that barely pierced Travis' ears.

""You-killer-why did you-"" She growled, ready to tear the bastard's throat out. Travis stood tall, looming over her as he raved at her.

 ""You see this-this travesty-and you have the audacity to ask why I give release?!?"" He snarled at her.  He brushed past her, hurrying to the kennels. ""Come child. If they treat an elder this way I shudder at what they are doing to the new bloods.""

\------------

Tamara followed suit, the fog of her mind clearing as she took more control. They ran through the halls with no resistance. The Bunker was smaller than you would think. As they followed the green and red lines, they passed several rooms that were set up as locker rooms, break-rooms, even office spaces one would use for accounting. They smelled like stale coffee and donuts, a hint of red velvet from someone's birthday. The grounds of those offices were littered with shredded paper and documents and panicked interns destroying evidence.

They passed an armory, fully stocked and loaded with riffles and stun guns. Held up in the corner was a sniveling intern with a purple tie, praying as he held a gun to his chest. The wolves ignored the peons-up ahead; they heard the faint sound of gunfire. Overheard Abbot repeated his ominous message as they raced through the halls. They came before a blue double door and burst through it.

They were met with rows upon rows of large kennels.  Each one held a snarling wolfman clawing and yipping at their chains. Blue overhead lights filled the halls, the floors concrete and sticky from mess. The green line ended and the red broke off into different sections, all leading into eight walls of kennels on each side. The place reeked of wet dog and dirty fur, the barks and howls bounced off the walls against each other, complimented by the canon fire of guns cutting off pained wolves.

Guards were going from kennel to kennel, cleaning the cages of their occupants. There was no time to argue, the pair broke off and sprinted down the halls. They surprised the guards who turned to fire upon them, but were met with teeth and claws. The scent of fresh blood riled up the caged wolves like chum in shark infested waters. They rattled their chains, wolves of all shapes and sizes. The guards fired upon the pair but were no match for them as they sliced and gnawed through them.

Limbs flew and bodies were slashed; it was a ballet of death. Travis roared in pain as a bloodied guard snuck up on him and jabbed him in the back with a cattle prod. It buzzed and zapped, the electricity frying him. He whipped around and grabbed his assailant's arm and twisted. It snapped and tore like an old G.I. Joe. Travis grabbed the prod and rammed it into the guard's mouth, shattering teeth as he plunged it down his throat and pulled the trigger. The guard spasmed and collapsed to the ground, eyes lighting up like a Christmas tree.

Tamara bobbed and weaved against the men, trying to disarm rather than kill. A bullet grazed her shoulder, stinging like an angry wasp. She saw red as she pounced at the begging man, tearing into him as she mauled him to death with gleeful rage.

Travis was like a hulking brute; he battered men to death with their buddy's torso and howled with sick pleasure as he butchered the guards. The remaining caged wolves cheered them on, howling and braying like madmen gone wild. He dragged half a dismembered body, a trail of intestine following suit. He saw a control panel, and slashed away at it until sparks flew and alarm bells rang out.

The cages opened in unison, and the remaining humans didn't even try to fight the wave of vengeance that fell on them. The caged wolves were like mindless beasts, free for the first time in months, free to embrace their new forms. They ran through the bunker like a plague of locusts, devouring anyone they came across. Travis revealed in the carnage, basking in it as the freed wolves gave praise to their liberator.

Tamara stood back, meat spilling from her bloodied maw as she stood appalled. It was pure chaos, pure killing for the sake of it. Was this the revenge she had sought? She backed herself against a wall as she watched in horrified awe as the brutality played out before her.

\----------

Travis followed the red lines, even among the chaos. It was like a blood trail leading him to a final atrocity. He got a whiff of it, even though all the gore. The decayed smell of dead wolves and burning bodies. The final lines led to a brass door tucked away from the back. There was a sign atop it that simply read: ""Processing.""

He entered the room, a massive meat locker. Dozens of bloodied meat hooks hung from the rafters, some with the hung bodies of skinned wolves. Their throats cut, blood drains littering the crimson stained floor. His feet clicked on the tiles as he made his way through the atrocity. The room was filled with crates and push bins filled to the brim with furs and coats. Wolf pelts were mounted on drying racks, staring at him with lifeless sockets. 

To his right another room, he could feel the heat from where he stood. He didn't want to go in there, see the burnt remains and ash piles. He stood among the slaughtered, and felt nothing but unbridled anger. He was so engrossed he didn't hear the high stepping man behind him with a loaded revolver.

He felt the punch of the silver slugs as they tore through his back. He roared and collapsed, his back smoking with tainted mist. His head spun and doubled as he clung to the cool tiled floor. A sticky, moist warmth formed under him, and he gasped with choked breaths as he watched his own blood begin to pool. The man stepped over him, the sounds of fighting and carnage from outside a distant whisper now.

In his dying moments, he heard his father's voice. There was fire in his words, yet they dripped with remorse.

""It's not too late for you, my boy. Repent-repent and call out to the light. You don't deserve to get put down like a dog."" His father mourned. Travis blinked, his vision a tunnel of light. In it he saw shapes call out to him, begging him to turn away. He wanted to join them-the light felt so warm and inviting.

""You know better, Travis. You have the blood of the beast flowing through you like a raging river. Now start acting like it."" The commanding voice of his master boomed to him, pulling him back into the fold.

The voices began to fade, as the command of the moon ordered him to rise. He readied himself, grieving the loss of the warmth. It had felt so real so- No. He struck that thought down. It was deception from the false idol, trying to draw him back into the flock. He felt himself healing as he pledged himself to the wolf once more. Reality snatched him back as he steeled his heart.

\----------

Alonzo Abbott looked at the dying creature at his feet and sighed, admiring the shine of his pelt. Damn shame, easy 10K he thought to himself as he holstered his revolver. He wore a bloodstained apron and wore blue latex gloves, his hair long and greased back. His face was sunken and rugged, rough to the touch like the tread of a tire. He listened to the sum of his life's work outside tearing itself to shreds. 

It didn't matter now he supposed-he had made a fortune off selling the blood and tears of these creatures, he could escape through the loading bay tunnels-a long walk for sure but at least he'd be alive. Once he escaped, he'd retire comfortably-hell with how much he had stashed away he could figure he could buy a whole island or two.

Still, the sting of losing this money maker was an ego burn for sure. He looked down on the dying thing, it looked back, like the dumb animal was sneering at him. He scoffed and kicked it across the jaw. He felt the creature's heavy head under his boot, relishing the clicking thud it made. He turned his back on it and took out his tape recorder-an old habit from his vet days. 

""Personal memo-once I get out of this place send a clean-up crew, incinerate everything, you don't need the wolves at your door down in Cabo do you Alonzo?"" He joked to himself. He turned to see the wolf stumbling to his feet. He raised an eyebrow, but didn't reach for his gun. He taunted the wobbling beast instead. 

""Look at the wild animal, he doesn't know he's dead yet. Fall down and stay down pup."" He waived a dismissive hand at the thing. The wolf stood tall, clasping a hand around his wounds. Abbot felt the hatred on his hot breath and stepped back.

""Get back-I'll skin you like the rest of the mongrels"" he growled. He reached to draw on the monster and finish him once and for all. He was quick.

But Travis was faster.

He grabbed Abott by the neck and lifted him in the air. His grasp was firm yet deadly. Travis growled from the pit of his stomach, shooting daggers into Abbot's face. He struggled, gasping for air as his airways were slowly crushed. His skin became a light shade of violet as Travis tightened the noose. 

""You-miserable little piss ant. My body flows with god's golden ichor-you think-silver will stop me?!?"" He got out-hiding the searing pain as he focused his mind.

 ""Y-you can talk?"" was all Abbott could choke out. Outside the wolves roared for more food, demanding another morsel. Travis stormed towards the brass door and kicked it open. He showed the horde the squirming Abbott in his hands as they foamed at the mouth. He brought Abott close to his snout to give him a final farewell. 

""This isn't personal human-this is simply divine retribution. This is the night of the werewolves. Now run for your life."" With that he tossed him to the crowd. Abbott stumbled to his feet as the wolves encircled him. To his credit he didn't beg, he didn't cry. He went for his gun and got a round off before the wolves pounced and began tearing him to bits. By the time they were finished all that remained of Abbott was a bloodstain on the floor and some chewed bones.

The leaderless pack roared and cheered like loons in the night-then turned their attention to each other. The wolves barked and jeered at each other like wild dogs, which Travis supposed they were. He watched them begin to turn on each other, these lost godless souls. Travis stepped forward and roared. The marauding wolves stepped back cowering. 

""Brothers and sisters-cease your petty bickering. You've been down here too long-your minds are wasted away-let me guide you to the promised land. You've never even seen him up close, have you?"" He pondered that last bit to himself as he plowed through the crowd, leading his found flock out of the dark.

\-----------

Tamara was not a part of that-she had slipped away in the chaos and climbed backup stairs. She had her fill. The mindless feeding sickened her now. What these hunters had done was abhorrent, but as she looked upon the scattered remains-she felt hollow. There had been no justice in this. Under the watchful crimson eye, she changed back, a painful force but the danger had passed. 

She found the jeep, still rumbling away in the night and stole it. As she drove away from the bunker of horrors-she noticed something sticking out of the sun visor.

She opened it and an old rosary fell to her hands. As the Jeep tumbled and rolled on the rocky road, she felt the wooden cross under her bloodstained nails. Her mother had always told her to say her prayers at night, lest the devil come under the moonlight and whisk her away. She thought of the lives she had taken, and the cross felt heavy in her hands. She placed it on her lap and stared straight ahead, silently reciting a prayer for the dead, and for mercy to be had on those who remained. 

\-------------------

The wolf pack poured out of the shaft and into the shadows of the night. Free for the first time in months they danced and howled, marveling at the majesty of the moon above. Travis climbed the roof of the cabin, basking in the glory of triumph. The wolf pack cheered him on-howling and braying like good little followers. He pointed up at the crimson lord and called out to his flock. 

""This is your god my friends-and I am its prophet."" He roared to thunderous howls. ""You are all blessed under the shadow of the blood moon. Hear my words, and worship at my altar."" The wolves cried out in praise, praise for the moon and praise for him. He basked in their adoration. There would be much work to be done in the morning-once the haze of blood and gore had passed.

This place would make a good den for the pack. He would sort them out, teach them the proper ways like his master before him. There were about forty total wolves, a good start indeed-soon enough he would teach them to seek out others he would deem worthy of the blessing, others worthy of their creed.

But that was tomorrow. For now, he joined the chorus of bellowing monsters, celebrating the god above. As he indulged in the carnal galla with the rest of the pack. The sanguine night belonged to them, and the forest would forever tremble against their never-ending lust for blood.",3,1769019815.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qj5rub,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1qj5rub/a_conversation_with_an_indian_roaster_that_made/,A conversation with an Indian roaster that made me rethink brew temperature.,"I am in Bhopal atm and met Navneet, who runs a cafe + roastery here. 

I met him in his cafe and he was super friendly and easy to talk to. He has also been judging the Indore/bhopal edition of world aeropress championship since past few years.

We ended up chatting about Indian coffee and brewing, and he shared a couple of perspectives that stuck with me.

He mentioned that most Indian coffees are grown around 1000–1300 masl, so the beans are generally less dense than high-altitude African or Latin American coffees. 

Because of that, they tend to extract more easily, and you don’t necessarily need near-boiling water for  light roast. 

Case in point: His barista made me Orchardale Estate med-light coffee  brewed on a Chemex at \~75 degree Celsius, which surprised me. 

it was genuinely good. I could clearly feel the acidity, felt that it was low bodied, and there was zero bitterness. It didn’t feel under extracted, just soft and very enjoyable. 

I ended up buying a pack to brew at home. I am now going to compare the 75 with 80-85 degree brew to see if there is an even better sweet spot. it definitely was a little unbelievable to see a med-light roast extracted so well at 75. 

He also felt that degassing times for Indian coffees don’t need to be super long, a few days post-roast is often enough, and the usual “wait two weeks for light roast” advice may be more applicable to very dense coffees or espresso.

A lot of what he mentioned did sound interesting but I am gonna test it out to see if I am able to reproduce the same results with lower temperatures and shorter degassing periods.

Did you guys see better extractions at lower temperatures? especially for light and medium roasts? 

or peak coffee taste with a shorter resting period? I'm definitely putting these theories to a test in the next couple of weeks.

PS:

also, try handcrafted coffee if you can order online from their site, definitely worth a try.

Navneet mentioned that they don't market the roastery so much because the customer acquisition cost is a little high. A customer has to buy a few kg of coffee for them to recover the cost of acquiring them. ",22,1769019800.0,IndiaCoffee,8,0.96,False
