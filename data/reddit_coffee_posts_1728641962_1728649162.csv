1g18di5,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1g18di5/the_silent_one_part_1/,The Silent One (part 1),"Another work week had come to an end. Antony Collins closed his folder with documents of his very recent case and put it back on the shelf with all the rest. With a single press on the off button, he quickly turned his work computer off. And finally, lights off, and locking of his office meant a beginning of the weekend. Antony loved the Fridays.

He rode his car through the streets enlightened with bright street lights under the already dark night sky. The people were out to have a great time at some bar or to have a nice dinner at some restaurant, or to just walk around.

Even the best lawyers in town deserve some great time out, he said to himself while entering the parking lot of the Ragussa Pub.

Inside, the atmosphere was electric with anticipation and the release of a long week’s tension. It was warm and lively, with a sense of camaraderie and shared relief that ripples through the room. It was dimly lit with dark wood beams, exposed brick walls, and a long, polished bar lined with stools. Tables were scattered across the scuffed floor, and a cozy, timeworn atmosphere filled the snug, intimate space.

Now he was looking for his table, and there it was. At the corner, by the big window that was opening towards a wonderful sight to the harbor. His group’s favorite place.

“Hey, lil’ hustler!” Jim greeted him, raising his pint.

“Joke’s on you, I’m getting paid overtime,” Anthony grinned, taking a sip of his beer.

“Overtime? For what? Filing complaints about our coffee machine?” Sarah teased.

“Nah, for making sure you guys don’t get sued after nights like this.” Anthony winked.

“Cheers to our future defense attorney!” Jim laughed, clinking glasses.

The night went the best it could. The three lawyers needed that beer and relief after their exhausting working week.

Anthony was now driving slowly and carefully looking for police patrolling somewhere. Even being among the best lawyers in the town with the experience and skills that he had, he couldn’t defend himself from getting his driving lisence taken for drunk driving. Still he felt sober enough to drive back home.

The neighborhood was quiet. Only the soft rustling of leaves could be heard under the gentle breeze, and his footsteps crunching through the fallen leaves seemed the loudest sound in the stillness. But then, everything stopped. The wind died down abruptly, leaving an eerie silence hanging in the air. Anthony paused, his senses on edge. The only sound now was his own racing heartbeat. Something felt off.

“Maybe four pints was one too many,” he muttered to himself, trying to shake off the unease. With a nervous chuckle, he headed inside for some much-needed sleep.

Sunday was a fishing day, and a day to drive the Chevy truck. Anthony drove past Jim’s house, the truck bed loaded with gear, and together they headed to the small pond just outside town. The air was crisp, with the scent of pine and damp soil, and the trees surrounding the water were ablaze with autumn colors: fiery reds, vibrant oranges, and golden yellows reflected in the still surface of the pond. The sulence was only broken by the occasional rustle of leaves and the soft plop of a fish jumping.

Anthony cast his line, watching the bobber float peacefully. “You know, Jim,” he said, “sometimes I think about quitting the law and just doing this for a living.”
Jim snorted. “Fishing?”

“Yeah,” Anthony grinned. “Think about it. No deadlines, no paperwork. Just us, the fish, and that one beaver over there that probably hates us.”

Jim laughed, casting his own line. “Sure, but you’d miss the thrill of defending people who can’t tell a lie from a laminated document.”

“True,” Anthony admitted. “But at least out here, the only thing trying to bite me is the fish.”

“Don’t forget the mosquitoes,” Jim added, swatting at his arm. “I’m pretty sure they’re on retainer.”

Anthony chuckled. “Guess they don’t know I’m billing them for overtime, too.”

But Jim didn’t respond. He kept silent instead. The occassional buzz of the mosquitoes vanished. The jumping of the fish stopped. No sound could be heard for a moment. Anthony looked around. The silence seemed so unnatural and so oppressive, as if it was pressing down on his chest, making his breathing heavy and his heartbeat stong enough so he would feel it in his ears.

But it went away, all of a sudden. Anthony could swear that he saw a silhouette between the trees on the oposite side of the pond, but Jim seemed that he didn’t notice anything. And as Anthony turned his head back to the water, something pulled his bait down in the pond. He pulled it back firmly, and there it was, a catfish almost a meter long, pulling against the fishing reel.

Jim jumped out of excitement.

“Well done, lil’ hustler!”, Jim yelled, while grabbing the big hook on a long, wooden handle to help Anthony pull the fish out of the water.

They were happy to catch a great dinner. In the evening that followed, Jim was in Anthony’s kitchen helping him with the cooking.

As they sat down to dinner, Anthony served the golden-brown catfish alongside crispy hushpuppies and a fresh salad.

“Here’s to a successful catch and a great dinner!” Anthony raised his glass, and Jim joined in, clinking his drink against Anthony’s.

“Cheers to our fishing skills! May our next catch be even bigger,” Jim added with a grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

They dug into the meal, the tender catfish was flaky and flavorful. Between bites, they talked about the day’s adventures, recounting how Jim had almost lost his balance while trying to help pull the fish with the hook.

“I swear I saw you about to take a dip!” Anthony laughed, wiping his mouth. “Next time, I’ll tie you to a tree.”

“Only if you promise to jump in after me if I go overboard!” Jim shot back, chuckling. 
“Deal!” Anthony replied, raising his glass again.

As they continued to eat, the conversation flowed effortlessly, filled with inside jokes and teasing. The warmth of friendship enveloped them, making the simple meal feel like a feast.

“Man, if every Sunday was like this, I’d never want to go back to work,” Jim said, leaning back contentedly in his chair.

“Agreed,” Anthony said, smiling. “Just us, the fish, and no emails.” 

The laughter and joy lingered long into the evening, leaving behind memories of a perfect day spent together. But one thing was was unclear to Anthony. Was he losing his mind?

Monday arrived, and Anthony was back in his office like every other workday. The low hum of the fluorescent lights provided a familiar, almost comforting presence, buzzing softly in every corner of the building. He was buried in a complex case, papers strewn across his desk as he tried to make sense of the overwhelming evidence. The mental strain finally caught up with him, and a sudden, pounding headache hit him hard. Standing up too quickly, he felt dizzy and nauseous.

The walk to the bathroom felt endless as his steps wobbled unsteadily. Just as he reached the door of his office, everything went silent, abruptly, unnaturally. That same uneasy feeling crept up his spine, like he was being watched. His heart skipped as he saw it again, a silhouette, standing motionless in front of the bathroom door at the end of the hall. 

He blinked, rubbing his eyes, and it vanished. The strange feeling lifted with it, the nausea fading. The hum of the lights returned, and the world felt normal again. But Anthony couldn’t shake the lingering chill that remained.

“Hey, buddy,” Jim called out from his office, peeking from behind the door. “You all right?”

Anthony leaned against the wall, still trying to catch his breath. “Yeah, man. I’m good,” he replied, his voice sounding exhausted and distant.

Jim stepped closer, his eyes widening as he got a better look at Anthony. “You’re pale like a dead man,” he said, quickly closing the distance between them. “Seriously, what’s up?”

Anthony forced a weak smile and put a hand on Jim’s shoulder. “I’m totally alright,” he said, trying to sound convincing. “Just… overworked. Too many late nights.”

Before Jim could respond, Sarah appeared at the end of the hall. Her eyes flicked nervously between the two of them, taking in Anthony’s pale face and uneasy stance.

“Hey, Anthony,” she said, her voice a little higher than usual. “You okay? You don’t look so good.”

“I’m fine,” Anthony insisted, straightening up and trying to sound more normal. “Just a headache. It’s nothing.”

Sarah hesitated, glancing around the hallway nervously. “Are you sure? You really don’t look well.”

“Yeah, I promise,” Anthony said, forcing another smile. “I just need to get some air, maybe grab a coffee.”

Jim still looked skeptical, but he nodded slowly. “Okay, but don’t push yourself, man. You really look like you need a break.”

Sarah nodded in agreement, her gaze darting around the hall again before she looked back at Anthony. “Yeah, take it easy. It’s just… you seem really out of it today.”

Anthony sighed, feeling the weight of their concern. “I’ll be fine,” he reassured them, though the words felt hollow. He could see the doubt in their eyes, especially Sarah’s, who kept glancing around as if she was searching for something.

“Okay,” she said softly, still watching him carefully. “But if you need anything, just let us know.”

“Thanks, guys,” Anthony said, his voice a little more steady now. “I appreciate it.”

As the days passed, Anthony couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling of being watched. As if the sudden silences weren’t unnerving enough, it was the shadowy silhouette that kept appearing, lingering at the edge of his vision, that truly disturbed him. None of it made any sense, yet the occurrences grew more frequent, each one tightening the grip of anxiety and paranoia around him. Was he losing his mind?

One rainy night, the three of them gathered at their usual pub. The storm outside was relentless, raindrops tapping steadily against the windows as if trying to join the conversation. The warm light inside contrasted sharply with the gloomy weather, casting a cozy glow over the group as they took their drinks.

Anthony took a long sip of his beer and then, after weeks of holding it in, finally spoke up. “I’ve been seeing something,” he began, his voice low but serious. Jim and Sarah looked up from their glasses, curious.

“Seeing what?” Jim asked, raising an eyebrow.

Anthony hesitated, then took a deep breath. “A shadowy figure. It’s been appearing around me, at home, at work. And every time, everything goes completely silent. No sound, nothing. It’s… it’s like the world just stops.”

Jim snorted, shaking his head with a smile. “You’ve been watching too many horror movies, man,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “Come on, you’re telling us you’ve got your own personal ghost now?”

But Sarah’s expression didn’t change. She stayed silent, her eyes locked on Anthony as if trying to gauge how serious he was. “When did this start?” she asked quietly.

“A few weeks ago,” Anthony replied, glancing around nervously. “It’s been happening more often lately. I didn’t want to say anything because it sounds crazy, but I swear it’s real.”

Jim rolled his eyes. “Okay, so let me get this straight. You see a shadow, everything goes quiet, and what? This thing just stands there staring at you?”

“Pretty much,” Anthony said, looking down at his hands. “It’s like it’s watching me, waiting for something.”

“Sounds like a bad dream,” Jim said, dismissing it with a wave. “I bet it’s just stress messing with your head.”

Before Anthony could respond, a heavy silence fell over the pub, so abrupt that it was almost tangible. The usual chatter, the clinking of glasses, even the rain outside, all of it ceased. The three of them froze, eyes widening in unison. Also, all the other patrons stared outside, utterly silent.

Then, through the pub’s large front window, they saw it: a tall, dark figure standing motionless across the street, barely illuminated by the streetlights. Its faceless silhouette seemed to blend into the shadows, an unsettling presence that sent a shiver down Anthony’s spine.

Jim’s face went pale as he stared at the figure. “What the hell is that?” he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Anthony swallowed hard, his throat dry. “That’s what I’ve been talking about,” he said shakily. “That’s it.”

Sarah, who had been watching the figure intently, suddenly looked at Anthony with something like fear in her eyes. “We need to talk,” she said, her voice urgent and trembling. “In private.”

And all of a sudden, all the sounds came back.

“Why? What’s going on?” Jim asked, as much confused as he was scared.

“Now,” she insisted, grabbing Anthony’s arm and pulling him away from the table. They hurried towards a quieter corner of the pub, leaving Jim staring after them, his expression a mixture of confusion and dread.

“What do you know about this?” Anthony demanded as soon as they were alone, his heart pounding.

Sarah glanced over her shoulder, then back at him, her eyes were wide, filled with fear. “It’s called The Silent One,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the ambient noise of the pub. “It’s not just a ghost or a figment of your imagination. It’s a summoned entity, a kind of dark spirit that obeys the will of whoever calls it.”

“A summoned entity?” Anthony repeated, struggling to comprehend. “How do you summon something like that?”

Sarah looked around again, as if she feared the walls themselves were listening. “There’s a ritual,” she said quietly. “It involves candles, blood, and a specific incantation. The person performing the ritual has to offer their own blood as fail-safe and stay absolutely silent until the job is done. The moment they make a sound, even the faintest whisper, The Silent One turns on them instead.”

“The job?” Anthony was confused. “What do you mean?”

Sarah continued. “A job is given to the entity to kill someone you ask it to. The blood of the victim is offered to it. But if the summoner breaks any rule, mostly the silence rule, The Silent One turns against them.”

Anthony felt his skin crawl. “How do you know all this?”

She hesitated, her eyes distant as if remembering something painful. “Because it happened to me once,” she said, her voice breaking slightly.

Anthony stared at her, stunned. “What? When?”

“A few years ago,” she said, glancing down at her trembling hands. “I defended this guy in court. A real psychopath. He killed eleven people in a mall shooting. I tried to get his sentence reduced, but I failed. He got life in prison.”

She took a deep breath, steadying herself before continuing. “After the trial, I started seeing things, just like you’re describing. The shadow, the silence. I thought I was losing my mind. Then, I got a call from the prison. They told me the man had performed some sort of ritual in his cell, calling it to kill me.”

Anthony’s heart sank. “But you’re still here.”

Sarah nodded, swallowing hard. “He broke the silence rule,” she said, her voice trembling. “He couldn’t keep quiet, even with his life on the line. He couldn’t resist to brag about it to the guards, and that was enough. The Silent One turned on him and… slit his throat with its silver knife. The guards saw it happen. They couldn’t explain it, but they saw it.”

Anthony’s mind was racing. “Is there any way to stop it?”

Sarah shook her head slowly, her eyes filled with despair. “No, Anthony. Once it’s summoned, it won’t stop until it’s done. But there’s one thing you can do to delay it: stay silent. It hunts by sound. If you stay quiet, you can keep it from coming closer. It’ll stay at the distance it’s already at, but it won’t go away. It’s just… delayed.”

Anthony felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead. “So, I just… don’t speak?”

Sarah nodded. “Exactly. But it’s only a temporary solution. It’s still out there, waiting. The silence just holds it off. It can’t make it leave.”

He took a deep breath, feeling trapped. “And the person who summoned it? They have to stay silent too?”

“Yes,” Sarah said. “One sound, and it turns on them. That’s how it works. The question is…” she looked at him, her expression dark with fear, “who would go through all of that to summon it for you, Anthony? Who wants you dead so badly that they’d risk their own life?”",1,1728648970.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

It was almost time for my medication for bacterial infection so I had to take the antibiotic and so I did pop a med, and put it in my mouth and then when I think about it now, I feel nothing make sense and has holes in my memories.


I felt like I haven't take the meds yet but I feel like I already did as if I completely forgotten about it. I should be remembered the sensation of drinking a drug and the taste of the pill but nothing comes out in my mind and when it does come out, it felt like a fake memory. It felt like I just black outed, but I remember after taking the meds, I made a coffee. However, before that, I can't remember.

Made me anxious that I forgot to put the pill in my mouth that I may have misplaced the pill somewhere without thinking. There is an evidence that I pop the pill out of the package, it just that I felt I don't believe I did take it.",1,1728648618.0,OSDD,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think of a beach house, the first images that come to mind are probably stunning views, breezy interiors, and a seamless blend with nature. To truly capture the essence of your beachfront retreat, innovative beach house designs are essential. The right floor plans can maximize both space and views, making your home a perfect sanctuary.

Understanding how to create spaces that both serve a function and retain aesthetic quality is crucial. Here are some innovative strategies that can help you design a beach house that feels both spacious and connected to the scenic surroundings:

### Open Concept Living

One of the best ways to maximize space in a beach house is through an open concept design. An open floor plan eliminates unnecessary walls, allowing natural light to flow freely throughout the space. This design not only makes the area feel larger but also enhances the beautiful views of sandy beaches and the ocean. Consider the following elements:

- **Living and Dining Areas:** Combining these two spaces allows for better social interaction and a more spacious feel.
- **Seamless Transitions:** Using the same flooring throughout these areas can create a cohesive look.
- **Large Windows:** expansive glass doors or windows can offer unobstructed views of the beach, bringing the outside in.

### Strategically Placed Outdoor Areas

Outdoor areas are just as important as indoor spaces in any beach house design. Creating decks, patios, or porches directly accessible from common rooms can foster a strong indoor–outdoor connection. Here are some features to consider:

- **Wrap-Around Decks:** These provide ample space for lounging and dining while enjoying beachfront views.
- **Covered Patios:** Adding covered outdoor spaces protects from the sun’s harsh rays and allows for relaxation during any weather.
- **Outdoor Showers:** A practical addition for beach lovers, these keep sand out of the house while adding a fun beachy vibe.

### Multiple Levels for Optimal Views

Designing a multi-level beach house can significantly increase the amount of living space while providing each room with views of the ocean. Here are a few thoughts on this approach:

- **Elevated Living Spaces:** Having the main living area on the second or third floor can capture better views and breezes.
- **Loft Areas:** Consider a loft for additional sleeping or lounging space without expanding the footprint of the home.
- **Balconies:** Adding balconies to upper floors creates personal outdoor escapes, perfect for morning coffee or sunset views.

### Flexible Spaces

Flexibility is key in beach house designs where you might want to accommodate guests or engage in various activities. Think about incorporating features that allow spaces to adapt:

- **Murphy Beds:** These can convert a home office or game room into an extra bedroom when guests arrive.
- **Sliding Doors:** Use sliding walls that can open up to transform a small area into an expansive space for gatherings.
- **Multi-Purpose Furniture:** Invest in furniture that serves more than one purpose to maximize the usability of your space.

### Emphasizing Sustainable Materials

Sustainable materials into your beach house design is a beneficial choice for both the environment and your health. Natural materials like bamboo flooring and recycled glass countertops not only look beautiful but also blend seamlessly with your natural surroundings. Consider these tips:

- **Local Materials:** Source materials from local suppliers to reduce your footprint.
- **Weather-Resistant Finishes:** Use finishes that withstand the salty air and moisture typical in beach environments.
- **Energy Efficient Windows:** These can help maintain indoor temperatures, making your beach house more comfortable.

Ultimately, innovative beach house designs allow you to create a sanctuary that maximizes both space and views. By focusing on open layouts, outdoor areas, multi-level designs, flexible spaces, and sustainable materials, you can craft a home that reflects your lifestyle and appreciates the breathtaking beauty of beach living.

Sustainable Features to Consider in Your Beach House Floor Plan
---------------------------------------------------------------

Designing your beach house floor plan is an exciting endeavor, but incorporating sustainable features can enhance your home while benefiting the environment. Sustainable features not only reduce your ecological footprint but also create a healthier living space. Here are some essential elements to consider when planning your beach house.

### Maximize Natural Light

Utilizing natural light reduces your dependence on artificial lighting and can create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Large windows and skylights are excellent options:

- Use oversized windows to flood spaces with light.
- Incorporate clerestory windows for privacy and sunlight.
- Consider sliding glass doors that open to outdoor spaces.

By carefully designing your floor plan around natural light, you can create a bright and airy environment that lifts the spirits.

### Energy-Efficient Appliances

When selecting appliances for your beach house, choose energy-efficient models. These appliances can significantly reduce your energy consumption and save on utility bills:

- Opt for Energy Star certified refrigerators, dishwashers, and washing machines.
- Consider induction cooktops, which use less energy than traditional gas or electric stoves.
- Install high-efficiency HVAC systems for heating and cooling.

By incorporating energy-efficient appliances into your floor plan, you can enjoy modern conveniences while being environmentally conscious.

### Water Conservation Systems

Water is a precious resource, especially in coastal areas. Implementing water conservation systems in your beach house can significantly reduce waste:

- Install low-flow faucets and showerheads to minimize water use.
- Consider a rainwater harvesting system to collect rainfall for irrigation and non-potable uses.
- Include drought-resistant landscaping in your exterior design.

These features help create a sustainable lifestyle while maintaining the beauty of your beach property.

### Eco-Friendly Materials

Choosing sustainable materials is crucial in any construction project. For your beach house, consider using:

- Recycled materials, such as reclaimed wood and metal.
- Bamboo flooring, which is a rapidly renewable resource.
- Low-VOC paints and finishes to improve indoor air quality.

These choices can enhance the aesthetic appeal of your home while reducing environmental impact.

### Smart Home Technology

Integrating smart home technology not only adds convenience but can also help in managing energy and water use:

- Install smart thermostats to optimize heating and cooling based on your lifestyle.
- Use smart lighting systems that adjust according to the time of day or occupancy.
- Incorporate home automation that controls water usage in irrigation systems.

By embracing technology, you can efficiently manage your resources, saving money and reducing waste.

### Renewable Energy Sources

One of the most significant ways to enhance sustainability in your beach house is to incorporate renewable energy sources. Think about:

- Installing solar panels on the roof to harness sunlight for energy.
- Using wind turbines if local regulations and conditions allow.
- Utilizing geothermal energy systems for heating and cooling.

These energy sources can provide significant savings on electricity bills while contributing to a greener planet.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Creating outdoor living spaces not only enhances your beach experience but also minimizes the need for additional indoor living areas, which can promote sustainability:

- Design open decks or patios that blend seamlessly with nature.
- Use permeable materials for outdoor walkways to facilitate rainwater absorption.
- Incorporate native plants in your landscaping to reduce irrigation needs.

Outdoor spaces can help you enjoy the coastal environment while minimizing environmental impact.

By considering these sustainable features in your beach house floor plan, you create a home that respects nature while providing comfort and convenience. Embracing these elements not only benefits you but also contributes positively to the environment.

### Conclusion

When you embark on designing your beach house, keeping functionality and aesthetics in mind is key. Innovative beach house designs not only enhance your living space but also make the most of the breathtaking views. Open floor plans, large windows, and multi-functional areas allow for a seamless flow between indoor and outdoor living, ensuring that you and your family can enjoy the beauty of your surroundings.

Additionally, incorporating sustainable features into your beach house floor plan can lead to a more eco-friendly lifestyle. Choosing energy-efficient appliances, using renewable materials, and designing for natural ventilation are just a few ways to minimize your environmental impact while also creating a healthy living space. The integration of solar panels and rainwater collection systems can further enhance sustainability, making your beach house not just a vacation destination but a responsible choice.

Ultimately, the floor plan of your beach house should reflect your lifestyle and values. Whether you envision a cozy retreat or a spacious family hub, focusing on innovative designs and sustainable features will transform your vision into a reality. Investing the time to carefully consider these aspects will ensure that your beach house becomes a cherished haven for years to come. With thoughtful planning, you can create a space that embodies comfort, beauty, and harmony with nature, allowing you to make lasting memories at the shore. Choose designs that inspire you, and embrace the serenity of beach life.",1,1728648198.0,House1000Designs,0,1.0,False

","So for context, me and my coworker were given a task to do and it’s an egregious task that my boss expects to be done within a week but that’s physically not possible. We’ve told him and he’s been adamant on the fact that if we power through we could do it. We’ve been trying to accommodate as much as we can, my boss has stated before that after getting this job three months ago, that the new hire was doing better and I’m not performing as I should even though I’m putting my all into it and I just got pulled into a meeting where he stated that he knows I want to learn and grow more here but that we’re going to start having weekly meetings about my progress and the communication I have with my other coworker even though we talk everyday. I physically don’t know what more I can do when I have been putting my all into what I do, and this job was supposed to be temporary I was gonna leave in December because I only took this job because it was right after my internship and needed the money. It’s not what I want to do at all and seeing that he’s clearly stated that I’m not doing good (even though I am according to everyone) and the fact that HR got into the call, should I start finding other jobs?

Everything about this was suboptimal to say the least. He was on his first major investigation, he lacked a partner, and this investigation would take place in one of the most rural parts of the state. Not only that, but due to “policy” he had to take a civilian car to take him here, which meant that he arrived in his own rusty old brown el camino from the 80s. Back in his precinct he usually took the police cars for personal travels as well. He was too good to be reprimanded by his chief for a miniscule off-the-books infringement like that. Nonetheless he was here and had a job to do. His cold hand took his glasses, which had fogged up by now, and stashed them deep in the inside pockets of his dark grey wool coat. 

The parking lot he stepped out into was the same as in any other slowly dying former boom town. A rundown motel, broken neon signs, trash, the usual really. After adjusting himself to the light rain and cold temperatures he made his way over towards the motel’s entrance. He stepped inside, slicking back his slightly wet dark brown medium long hair, finding himself in a small reception room with lighting that was already starting to give him a headache. Suddenly a sharp ringing cut through the air after Henry had hit the “ring here” bell to notify some staff to come to the reception desk. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen, that was until the door through which he had entered opened behind him.

“You’re the detective, aren’t you?”

The woman behind him seemed to be a local police officer. She wore the typical sheriff’s uniform, with a dusty brown leather jacket, paired with black uniform pants and the usual bravado of someone with authority. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am. Special Agent Henry Neal.” 

He supressed the urge to show his badge. For some reason he still was usually assuming that no one would believe him to be a police officer.

“Good. I’m deputy Riley Harper. Come on, Jennifer won’t be here for another hour, she’s out for a drink or two, well, maybe five…”

Henry followed the deputy across the road, past some old shops and to a small diner. It looked like every stereotypical American diner you could imagine. Inside she sat down with him at one of the tables and took off her jacket, just as a waitress approached her.

“Hello there Riley!” 

The woman who was probably in her 40s greeted the deputy with a warm smile on her face.

“What can I bring you today?”

She looked at Henry and her smile turned more into a smirk.

“And the handsome fellow you brought with yourself?”

“Stop…”

Clearly the deputy felt embarrassed by this interaction, though she was “saved” by a strong raspy voice coming from the counter.

“Oy, Sally.” An older man with little to no hair aside from his thick grey beard stood behind the counter with his arms crossed.
“We don’t serve that kinda folk round ‘ere.” His comment clearly was targeted towards Henry.

“Listen, I just need a coffee with milk for myself and one to go for the chief.” The deputy said and smiled.

“Coming right up!” The waitress answered and left for the counter.

“So…” the deputy faced Henry, “You’re probably here for the hanged man aren’t you?”

He looked at her, actually having heard that the murder victim had been hanged for the first time just now.

“Yes, exactly.”

So I’ve been on leave from work lately (for 5 weeks) and I have been wondering what people do during the day. I did all the holiday jobs I wanted but have still had heaps of time for resting and exercising. Without spending money I just don’t know what people do with their lives. Mainly single people who live alone but not in a big city. I never feel like I’ve accomplished anything because of my ADHD and inability to really feel like I’ve achieved stuff, especially when it’s like day to day. Like some days I’ll swim 3km, walk my two dogs and get coffee, come home and vacuum and mop and tidy and do 3 loads of washing and then it’s like 11am and I sit on the couch for the rest of the day attempting to read my book and not. Then maybe another walk and play with the dogs, or other form of exercise, tea and tv. Like what do people do once the jobs are done and you do t have energy for bigger jobs? I still feel like I’ve done nothing. Like I could bake, but then I’ll just eat the entire batch of whatever in like a day. If I leave the house I’ll just spend money. Sometimes friends are busy or I’m just exhausted and not ready for people or they’re at work. Is this all that normal people do during the day? I used to think I’d love to not have a job and I’d be so fit, but I just sit around in the sun like a snoozy cat all day and then have manic bursts of doing house jobs or really random house things. Am I normal? Even today for example, I swam 2km with a friend and had coffee and breakfast, got my nails done and a pedicure, my dad came round and remove the oven element, and a broken window, I went to Bunnings for new window supplies, fixed the window, went and got the element tested, went for drinks and dinner with friends. I’m exhausted and I know that’s a lot, but I also don’t feel like I’ve done enough and haven’t achieved the right things. And also like if I wasn’t doing these things because I don’t want to be exhausted, what do I actually do with my time? And then other days I will literally do nothing but sit on the couch to recover from these days. It’s like you’re either dead on the couch or I do the jobs but still feel like it’s not enough.

It is I, Boyan, greatest Flutter developer in all Kazakhstan! I come to you with important question. I want to show my big brain power to USA companies—yes, land of Apple, giant coffees, and peoples with many, many monies! But how can I make them say, “Wawaweewa! This Boyan, we must hire him! He make app so nice, even iPhone blush!”

What project can I make as Flutter dev that is big, glorious, and make US and A recruiterka swipe right on me faster than goat runs from gypsy?

Here is what I do very nice:

	•	Make UI so smooth, even Pamela Anderson would say, “Wow, so sexy!”
	•	I handle widget tree like I wrestle bears—strong, fast, and nobody gets hurt.
	•	I make animations so silky, you feel like sliding down butter mountain on finest yak milk sled.
	•	Third-party SDKs? Yes, I do! I integrate like mama makes stew—perfect every time!
	•	I can make performance optimization so tight, app runs faster than gypsy steal chicken at village fair!
	•	I also make code DRY like desert—no extra nonsense, just glorious lines that do all things!

So what can I build? Maybe I make:

	•	Big high-performance Flutter app that even Android phone from 1990s say, “Please, I can’t handle this much speed!”
	•	Or I build cross-platform app so powerful, developers forget what native even is?
	•	Or maybe I make modular architecture so flexible, it can bend like strong Kazakh gymnast!

What will make hot recruiter lady say, “This Boyan, we need him for remote contracts ASAP, or we cry forever!”? Please help, friends! I want to bring my glorious Flutter powers to America and make apps that crush like bear hug!

My sister is #4 ~~prostitute~~ developer in all of Kazakhstan!

**Resident advises he contacted council member Liz Sheehan for the 5th district regarding missed limbs at the curb. Resident advises he ran the truck down last week and the drivers advise the limbs were not in regulation due to not being tied. Resident**
states council member Sheehan spoke with a supervisor on 10/9 and was advised the items will be serviced on 10/10. No record of the call and no request have been entered, per dispatch if in regulation and at the curb the items will be serviced on the regular service day tomorrow, 10/11. Resident was upset and stated someone was  lying to him about getting the limbs picked up.

I tried other pre workouts but most have Niacin and beta alanine… those make my skin tingle and I can’t stand it. I use to not mind it years ago but it’s too much now. The image is the ingredients from megawatt.

I recently started buying my own green coffee beans and a mini-roaster and started experimenting with different temperatures and coffee beans strains and I was curious what are some of the best coffee roasting combinations you experienced so far? (What machine did you use, what temperature did you roast at and how much time did you roast it for?)

My personal favorite was Colombia Supremo EP roasted medium dark ( for 15 minutes at about 205\*C) and I use an SR800 Automatic Coffee Bean Roaster. I'm curious to hear what some other redditors are doing when it comes to roasting their own coffee beans - Let's connect!

Hii everyone, I’m a 20 yo guy from Serbia. Considering I’m closeted I don’t exactly wanna reveal my face on this sub but we can do that in private chat.         

Also, tell me something about yourself in your first message if you decide to send me a message, instead of just saying “hey”, otherwise I won’t reply.


My body pics are on my profile if that matters, I take care of myself in that sense.

before:

- kerja kantoran, pasangan freelance ngajar private

- both of us is sandwhich gen

- makan ngandelin subscription grab untuk promo

now:

- gua kerja remote, pasangan tetap freelance tapi di persedikit dan mulai coba jualan online

- still a sandwich gen lol

- masak sendiri, (this one somehow works wonder for efficiency)

  
begini kira"" expenses kita berdua per bulan, (notes kita tinggal di jakarta)

https://preview.redd.it/vczhem6wx3ud1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=728051949e3ea55d1e87633d3b0e44bfdcf442b5

dari perubahan ini banyak hal yg jadi insight menarik buat gua:

- masak sendiri jauh lebih enak, sayur"" macem kyk cah buncis dan sawi pun bisa jadi enak klo masak sendiri dan lebih terasa sehat? tapi gua masih pake MSG wkwkwkkw

- dengan masak sendiri makin kesini makin males makan diluar krna rasanya ga se wow masakan sendiri dan ga se sastifying saat bisa makan sebanyak apapun dirumah, cost buat ngedate bulanan sama pasangan jadi turun mayan jauh dari yg keluar ngedate 4-6 kali, jadi cuma perlu 2-3 kali sebulan

- gua sama pasangan demen ngopi, tapi krna skrang punya waktu yg lebih banyak dirumah krna gua ga prlu ke kantor jadinya gua belajar bikin kopi sendiri pake v60 dan modal beli grinder, akhirnya 2 bulan uda ROI grindernya dibanding gua ngopi diluar wkkwkw beli biji toraja ato aceh gayo 80 rebu per kantong bisa buat ngopi 12-15x and much better daripada americano di coffee shop pada umumnya, tapi yg rasanya ga kalah masih ada sih kyk first crack coffee tapi dia mahal kopinya di range 40-60k

- kita masih belum punya mobil jadi masih pake gocar or grabcar untuk pergi yg mau gamau harus pake mobil, but maybe tahun depan mau gamau beli krna uda di tuntut untuk keluar jakarta kalo ada acara keluarga or jualan istri uda perlu mobil untuk ngangkut barang lebih banyak

- subscription kita coba seminim mungkin yg primary aja  buat nonton, musik, game, VPN (obviously). dan xbox gamepass sangat worth it buat para gamer krna makin banya jrpg yg full on denuvo dan gua ga harus beli full price di steam 800k++ buat game itu

- pengeluaran lain-lain gua paling tiap kuartal gua top-up monthly pass star rail yg 79k or gua beli 1 game yg mau gamau gua beli krna masih ada denuvo dan ga ada di gamepass tapi gua ngebet main wkkwkw

- listrik gua agak boros krna dulu sblum gua remote pun istri ngajar privat, jadi beberapa murid ada yg dateng ke tempat untuk belajar jadi AC kudu nyala terus, dan gua pake kompor induksi buat masak.

- internet agak harga mati krna gua prlu buat kerja, istri perlu buat sometimes livestream, dan game skrang yg sizenya gede bangett

  
cuma dari sini beberapa hal yg gua bisa bilang nge cheat krna hoki + privilege yg gua dapet sih :

1. gua ada banyak krtu kredit krna kerja dibidang sales sblumnya dan perlu entertain customer jadi dibantu dibikinin beberapa CC buat reimbursement dan ini kepake buat beberapa expense kyk internet bisa gua hajar biznet 150mbps yg 375/bulan jadi 320/bulan pake promo yg setahun cuma bayar 9 bulan, VPN yg gua langsung subs 2 tahun jadinya cuma 38k, spotify and netflix yg patungan sama temen n sodara

2. hoki aja dapet kerja remote yg gua ga sangka jadi punya banyak waktu buat ngerjain hal manual kyk masak dan bikin kopi sendiri

  
dari kalian ada insight atau opini lain soal budgeting bulanan kah? 



notes: buat yg punya istri dan dia masak buat lu, please give them more respect, mreka yg buat lu bisa punya expenses yg lebih efisien dan jadi bisa nabung lebih banyak.

TL;DR dari pengeluaran ini gua yg tadinya total expenses sekitar 50% dari pendapatan, jadi 43% pendapatan so far menurut gua ini sangat oke mengingat benefitnya dari cuma ngeganti makan diluar jadi masak sendiri.",5,1728646037.0,finansial,14,0.86,False
1g17if2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1g17if2/opening_a_coffee_in_morocco/,Opening a coffee in Morocco,"As the title said, I’ve been thinking a looot about opening a coffee place in Morocco, and i really need advice to understand if my idea would make sense! 

For context, I’m a young girl from Italy, with years of experience of working in coffees, bars and restaurants. I’ve been dreaming a lot about managing my own place, and I love the idea of starting my project it in Morocco (I’ve already been there for 3 months in total). I definitely loved the time I spent there, and as soon as I saw the amount of time and money that people spend just chilling in coffees (both tourists and locals), the idea of starting a business there came to my mind. 
I know how fast tourism is growing there, and I guess that investing time and effort in a country like Morocco would probably be a smart idea. (correct me if you think I’m wrong haha)

Also, my goal is not to get a crazy amount of money from this, i would just like to create a cozy and stimulant place, while in the same time earning enough money to live a decent life and save something. So let’s say I’m not really driven by economic reasons, it’s more about improving the quality of my working life. 

Some things to point out are that: 

- I’m thinking about renting a place on the west coast
- I own a car
- I would include fresh homemade food all day long, something easy and low effort
- My place would be addressed mostly to a tourist clientele
- I would like a tiny place, a single room inside + a rooftop/outdoor place 
- I would try to save money of renovation costs by doing the most hand made works that I can (painting, crafting, etc..) 
- I studied graphic design so I would do all the graphic side of the project by myself (advertising, sign, menus..)
- I have reliable people living there that could help me 

Soo my questions are: 

• How many thousands of euros do you think would be a good start? (rent, furniture, machines, taxes, renovation basics, bills) I honestly have no idea 🥲

• Being a foreigner girl under 30, would there be any economic help from local institutions? I read about tax reductions, but there’s not much more information online. 

• Do you think there would be affordable rent prices on the west coast? 

• Would it be hard to promote my place and make it a safe and stable business? I’m scared locals would probably try to make my life hard..

I think that’s everything, thank you for reading, any help would be really appreciated!<3🙏🏼 ",4,1728645985.0,Morocco,12,0.83,False

1g17ej1,https://i.redd.it/nwt4td8s24ud1.jpeg,The Quiet Lunch,"One afternoon, I found myself at a cozy little café by the river, seeking a quiet break from a busy week. The weather was perfect—not too warm, not too cool—just right for sitting outside and enjoying a meal in the fresh air.

I had ordered a plate of fried salmon with Rösti and spinach, something I hadn’t had in a while. When the plate arrived, I smiled to myself. It looked as good as I had hoped—crispy salmon, golden Rösti patties, and a healthy portion of spinach on the side.

I took my time eating, savoring each bite, watching people stroll by. It was one of those meals where everything just tasted right, and for a moment, everything around me seemed to slow down. I wasn’t in a rush, I wasn’t thinking about work or anything else—I was just there, enjoying my lunch.

The café wasn’t too crowded, but a few tables were occupied by others who seemed to be doing the same—enjoying the quiet moment. A couple nearby was sharing a meal, quietly chatting, and a man on the other side of the terrace was reading a book, occasionally sipping his coffee.

As I finished the last bite of my Rösti, I noticed an older gentleman at the next table glance over and smile. “Looks like you enjoyed that,” he said with a friendly nod.

I smiled back. “I did. It was exactly what I needed.”

He nodded knowingly. “This place has a way of doing that. I come here often myself—there’s something about the simplicity of it, right?”

I agreed, and we exchanged a few words about the café, the food, and the weather before falling back into the quiet comfort of our own spaces.

After paying the bill and thanking the waiter, I left the café feeling content. It wasn’t an extraordinary afternoon—there was no wild adventure, no unexpected event. But sometimes, the best moments are the simple ones, the ones where life feels easy and peaceful.

I wake up at 5:30 am in a bus stop. It’s still super cold even though it’s already daylight. I quickly pack up my things and head down into the valley. At the first bakery, I have a hot coffee and lots of sweets. The baker has already noticed that a race is passing by, as many riders have chosen this route. It’s a popular alternative to the Grossglockner High Alpine Road, with a more manageable elevation gain.

My knees are really painful in the morning when my legs are still cold. On top of that, I’ve got the start of a cold. Am I getting sick? After last night, I wouldn’t be surprised. I grab some Ricola Kräuterzuckerli and a cup of tea at a petrol station and head for the Katschberg, a brutally steep pass with sections of over 20%. Even with all the pain, I’m looking forward to the day. The weather’s perfect, and if all goes well, I’ll make it through parcours 1 to checkpoint 1 today.

I’m in a good mood as I ride along great cycle paths through Italy towards the Mangart Pass. The climb is nice and steady and mostly shady. That’s great because it’s really hot now. At the top, I am rewarded with a breathtaking view over the Slovenian Alps. After 1000 meters of climbing in one go, I can’t manage to say a straight sentence into the Lost Dot Microphone for the TCR podcast.

I quickly eat a few Mentos, drink a Coke and put on my rain jacket. Then it’s time to leave the summit. @valentinrappfilm films during the high-speed descent with just one hand on the handlebars for the ZDF documentary and overtook me anyway. I still don’t know how he did it. I think he’s related to Tom Pidcock. The descent seems to take forever, but it’s great fun. After I ride through the stunning Soča Valley, a place that feels familiar to me from past vacations. I stock up at a local shop and prepare for the third pass of the day. Today I’m really gaining altitude.

I cycle steadily up the Vrsic Pass at sunset and I notice that my knee hurts less on the climbs than on flat sections, which gives me hope for the coming days. At the top of the pass, I collect my first stamp at a mountain hut. Unfortunately, it was already fully booked, otherwise I would have liked to spend the night there. So, I begin the descent into the valley again. It looks like another night without a hotel.

I don't let this get me down and ride into the night on perfect cycle paths through eastern Slovenia. I know from my route planning that it's super beautiful all around me. Unfortunately, I can't see any of it. I try using Google Maps to find cosy bus stops to sleep in, but it’s not easy and takes up time. By 1:00 am, I finally find a church with a covered area. As I close my eyes, I dream of a proper hotel bed.

1g17dg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g17dg2/10_creative_ways_to_style_poufs_and_cushions_in/,10 Creative Ways to Style Poufs and Cushions in Small Spaces,"Styling small spaces can be a challenge, but with a little creativity, you can transform even the tiniest areas into cozy and functional havens. Poufs and [cushion](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/cushions) are versatile decor pieces that can add comfort, texture, and style without taking up much room. Here are 10 creative ways to incorporate poufs and cushions into your small space decor.

**1. Use Poufs as Extra Seating**

One of the best ways to maximize a small space is by using a [pouf](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) as extra seating. Poufs are lightweight, portable, and can be easily moved around the room when needed. Whether you're hosting guests or relaxing in your living room, a pouf offers a comfortable place to sit without taking up too much floor space.

**2. Create a Cozy Reading Nook**

Transform an unused corner into a cozy reading nook by adding a pouf and a few cushions. Stack a couple of large cushions against the wall for back support, and place a soft pouf on the floor to use as a seat. Add a throw blanket and some ambient lighting, and you’ve got the perfect spot to unwind with a good book.

**3. Layer Cushions on Your Sofa**

Enhance the comfort of your sofa by layering cushions in different sizes, colors, and textures. Choose a mix of small and medium-sized cushions to add depth and visual interest. For a more cohesive look, match the cushions to the existing color scheme of your room, or use them to introduce pops of color in neutral spaces.

**4. Outdoor Cushion Seating for Balcony**

If you have a small balcony or patio, don’t let the limited space stop you from creating a comfortable outdoor oasis. Opt for floor seating with [outdoor cushion](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/textiles/outdoor-cushions) in vibrant patterns. Arrange a few outdoor cushions directly on the floor or on a rug to create a laid-back seating area perfect for lounging outside.

**5. Pouf as a Coffee Table Alternative**

In small living rooms, where space is tight, you can use a sturdy pouf as a coffee table. Place a decorative tray on top to hold drinks, books, or candles. When you need more floor space or additional seating, simply remove the tray, and the pouf can serve multiple purposes.

**6. Use Cushions as Floor Seats**

For casual gatherings or movie nights, floor seating can be a great space-saving option. Place large cushions on the floor to create comfortable seating without the bulk of traditional chairs. This works especially well in small living rooms or bedrooms where you want to add seating without cluttering the space.

**7. Pouf as a Footrest**

A pouf can double as a stylish footrest, especially in spaces where a traditional ottoman might be too large. Pair it with an armchair or a compact sofa, and enjoy the comfort of kicking up your feet after a long day. Plus, the pouf adds texture and a pop of personality to the room.

**8. Mix and Match Patterns**

Don’t be afraid to mix and match different patterns and textures when styling your cushions and poufs. Choose a mix of bold geometric prints, soft neutrals, or even ethnic-inspired designs to add visual interest to your small space. Just remember to keep a balance by coordinating colors or keeping the patterns within the same color family.

**9. Poufs for Under-the-Table Storage**

Another space-saving idea is to tuck poufs under a table when they’re not in use. This keeps the room uncluttered while still having extra seating or footrests on hand when needed. Opt for smaller poufs that can easily slide under a coffee table or console table, making the most of every inch in a compact room.

**10. Outdoor Pouf for Versatility**

An outdoor pouf can be a great addition to small patios or gardens. Choose weather-resistant materials that can withstand the elements, and use them as seating, footrests, or even as small side tables when paired with a tray. Their versatility makes them ideal for spaces where you need furniture that serves multiple purposes.

**Final Thoughts**

Incorporating poufs and cushions into your small space is an easy and stylish way to enhance comfort and functionality. Whether indoors or outdoors, these pieces add versatility and personality to any room. With these 10 creative styling ideas, you can make the most of your small space while adding warmth and coziness.

Don't let a lack of square footage limit your creativity. Instead, embrace the flexibility of poufs, cushions, and outdoor cushions to make your small space truly your own.",1,1728645446.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

I'm waiting for my shift in the parking lot and it's all I can think about haha. I know how the joke goes. Give a man a single compliment and he'll think about it every day for years. Maybe not so much of a joke after all lol

The entire time I've been going there in the mornings, weve never exchanged anything more than the standard pleasantries. Always thought she was really cute but I try to just keep my head down and not bother people. 

A few days ago I shaved off my beard that i had for over a year. I grew it out of self-consciousness, to try to hide the weight id been gaining. Plus I can grow a hell of a beard, thing was full and down to my chest.

Well, I've been on a weight loss regiment and it's been paying off shockingly fast so I felt comfortable enough to shave the beard. I didn't expect the barista to notice and *definitely* didn't expect her to comment on it. But she did. She went to  hand me my coffee and paused when she saw my face haha but she recovered quickly, handing me the coffee and smiling, commenting ""you shaved your face :O"". But the way she said it, she said it softly, like a pleasant surprise or something. I didn't really know what to say, just kinda grinned and said like ""yep, it was time"" or something dumb

Then she beamed at me and said ""you look really good!"" Im not even sure if I was able to stutter a ""thank you"" at her before she left the window. Huh?? No way. Did that really just happen? The rest of the drive into work I had a stupid grin plastered onto my face. Still do actually. This'll sustain me for the next 15 years probably. 

But yeah that's all. Super exciting I know. Thanks for reading. I know it's dumb, just had nowhere else to share really

I never understood why people insist on drinking coffee from a mug instead of a glass. People drink tea from a glass because they want to see the color (to see how strong it is). Why can't I drink coffee from a glass for the same reasons?

I get clowned on constantly by my girlfriend, her family and my family for drinking coffee in a glass. I only have coffee mugs at home because they refuse to drink coffee in anything else than a mug.

As a 26 year old man, I talk to almost everyone and continue talking to polite and respectful people. 

Men in 20s are easy to talk to but many of them are assholes and impolite. While men above 30 (especially mid 30s and above) are the easiest to talk and are polite, friendly, give a lot of  friendly, constructive advise. Women above 30 are also equally friendly.

Women in 20s are the hardest to talk to and many of them are walking red flags. While many of them are not outright rude, they tend not to give open-ended answers, tend to avoid eye contact with others outside their girls group, don't smile back. I respect their choice of being closed, reserved, cold but I maintain my stand saying that they lack manners.

There are some types of women who I found are to be avoided always:

1. Gossip type: this one is straight from high school who always gossips about people but never talks directly to the same people they gossip about

2. Opportunist: while most people are opportunists, women in 20s are observed to be the biggest opportunists since they have a lot of simps orbiting them and will run errands for them even though the girl is dating someone else (I say this because those losers actively stick with their female ""friend"" alone while she often ditches him for some guy who asks her out without simping. This shit is funny since I asked out many decent women out for coffee, lunch, hangouts and even hooked up with one of them. She also revealed that her ""simp"" friend always goes out of his way to do stuff for her but didn't have the guts to ask her out)

3. Unfriendly: although it's impractical to expect women to as friendly as men, 99% of the time they lack manners, don't reciprocate politeness, cold. Again this happens because they usually have a gang of simps ready to obey her orders.

4. Zero personality: NO! I don't expect women to be charming/career bees. It's fine not not to be ambitious, it's okay to prefer becoming a homemaker. I even empathize with these types since I was also bad at expressing myself and initiating conversations during my teens. But how is it even possible to sit through and make an entire conversation one-way without asking any questions in return? Even during my teens I often ran out of stuff to say but it never went to the point of not asking questions in return. But the bright side is these women tend to be polite, smile a little and are not cold.

5. Judgmental: This is the worst of these 5 types. Almost similar to the gossip type. They don't stop at gossiping. They actually judge people 24\*7, judge based on appearances, judge people who walk past them, judge based on status etc. The worst part is they don't keep their judgements with them and turn it into a gossip.

Now before you pounce on what I said, this is not a generalization. But it's weird how women in their 20s are the hardest to be friends with or to initiate a conversation. 

Every other age group and gender is friendly enough. But the above mentioned personality types are a pain to talk with. Especially women above their 30s are kind and friendly 99% of the time.

What are some other types of women to avoid, according to you?

1g176gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1g176gd/i_posted_here_a_month_ago_about_being_refused_for/,I posted here a month ago about being refused for the first time. The funeral was yesterday.,"I posted here a few weeks ago about getting refused at the 24H shop near my house at 3AM after a family friend who I have known since I was born suddenly passed away with no warning. The funeral was yesterday, which still seems strange to type out as I'm still struggling with the idea that she's really gone. I decided I was going to do Sober October to give myself a hard limit on drinking, as so often I'm able to find excuses and exceptions to the rules I've made for myself and ""it's Sober October, no exceptions"" seems to be a good way of stopping myself from trying to reason it away. On a related note, I've got so much done over the last 11 days I can hardly believe it. I won't lie and say it's been easy- it hasn't- but I've been kind to myself and open about my feelings/urges instead of hiding them away, and powered through regardless.

I knew the funeral was going to be difficult, I don't think there's such a thing as an easy funeral. I knew the church was going to be packed with people that knew me by family association, or because my family friend had talked to them about me, or because they were friends with my parents when they were younger. All of that was true. There was a lot of crying, a lot of sadness, but there was also laughter and photos and a lot of tea and coffee and cake and sandwiches and talking after, and then we all went home. And despite the gnawing sensation of wanting to crawl into the dull, numbing black hole that alcohol provides, I drove right past that 24H shop on the way home and got through the whole day without drinking. My husband is proud of me, my mum is proud of me, and I am awake and working on jobs that I almost certainly would have had to reject if I'd started drinking last night. Most importantly, I am proud of myself.

Some of you will be disappointed to learn I didn't go back and thank the cashier- I am far too anxious and awkward of a person to do that without alcohol as a crutch. But I do think about him and use his actions as fuel for my journey, and if I happen to run into him next time I'm getting milk or a sandwich or something at a reasonable time, I'll look him in the eyes and say thank you.

1g1762i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1g1762i/rocd_after_the_breakup/,ROCD after the breakup,"My ex gf (F26) and I (F24) broke up less than a week ago. I froze up in conflicts, was hypervigilant to her emotions, needs and boundaries, while being unable to cope with my own feelings of doubting my love for her and the relationship (I think it might be ROCD) and feeling and expressing my own emotions, needs and boundaries. Towards the end I put myself under so much pressure, ruminating about whether to break up or stay. We talked about our patterns and she was the one to break it off. It was a „good“ break up, no blaming or shaming the other, we both acknowledged our parts in it, expressed our love but that it was impossible to have a healthy relationship at this point. I need therapy, I need time and a neutral relationship to explore these patterns without pressure and she needs to feel safe in expressing herself without her partner freezing up and spiraling. 

At first it just felt relieving, sad yes but not half as much as when I was in the relationship and terrified of it ending, me hurting my partner or getting hurt. I’ve been single for most of my life, I’m self sufficient, surrounded by loving friends and family, I have my moments of slacking off and being down but I don’t fall into a hole. The fear of the breakup was way bigger than the breakup pain itself, the world didn’t end like I felt it would. 

But a few days later and I’m questioning the decision. I think we did the right thing to have some time and space apart (decided to go no contact for a few weeks and then to meet up for coffee and exchanging clothes, books, keys…). But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not the end. Maybe bc we didn’t breakup out of a lack of love or similar values, but out of communication and mental health issues. We had this incredible chemistry, our friends and family were so supportive of us, we both grew a lot and felt safer and more understood by each other than any partner before. At the same time we had some avoidant/fearful avoidant dynamics, our love languages clashed sometimes which made me feel even more insecure and wrong, I seek more comfort in a relationship and she likes challenges. Those aren’t impossible issues to work through, I know there’s no partner that I’ll never feel triggered by, no one that will match up with me 100 %… 

I’m torn between feeling like I’m losing a person I have a chance for growing and experiencing love and partnership with. I’m also afraid of reentering a relationship that will entail more hard work than might be “necessary”, that I could meet someone who makes me feel even more safe, who’s love languages match better with mine, someone who things will feel a bit more steady with (my ex had some moments of pushing me away when her avoidance came out). 

For now and thanks to the break up I’m able to let it go a bit, let the thoughts flow and see where they land instead of holding on too tight on the relationship and the need for it. But if you have some input from your own experience with this I would highly appreciate it. Maybe this also helped someone to see the other side of the panic, I hope y’all know you are very strong and that life will be confusing but beautiful with or without your relationship!

We had this Polish neighbor, her name was Monika. 
She was a friend of my mom's.
Her grandmother, who lived in Poland, had recently passed away. 
Shortly after all sorts of weird things started to happen in her house.

They had this trashcan with a swinging lid that could turn around 360 degrees. 
At night, when they were in bed, she could hear the top of the trashcan just swaying back and forth going tick, tick, tick, tick.
She would get up, go to the kitchen but when she got there it had stopped.
Went back to bed and it would start again, this went on all night long days in a row.
They had three bedrooms in their house, and they all had sliding windows. One of these windows would always be open when she got home, even though she knew for sure that she had closed and locked it.

Stuff started moving around the house, things disappearing and reappearing in other places, or sometimes reappearing in the same spot where she knew she had already looked, but it wasn't there before.
She always felt watched and uneasy whilst in the house.

Then one day, we were over at her house, me, my mom, Monika, and her stepdaughter, who was the same age as me. We were sitting on the couch, watching TV and chatting a bit. There was a coffee mug right in front of Monika on the table. As she reached for the mug, it slid across the table from the right corner all the way over to the left. We all watched and gasped in horror. We all saw it happen. Nobody touched the mug, yet it still slid from one end of the table to the other side as she reached for it.

Not a moment later, we heard the bedroom sliding window open. 
Then we saw the glass display cabinet next to the TV open, and a glass figurine and a cup fell out. The door closed again afterward. 
The trashcan in the kitchen started to sway again, making that ticking sound. Another bedroom door opened, that room they mostly used for storage. There was an ironing board in there, and it suddenly fell over, out of nowhere. That was it. We were scared. We all got out and went to our house.

My mom happened to have a friend who called herself a medium, her name was Donny.
I was always skeptical about her. 
My mom called Donny and asked if she could please come over the next day to inspect Monika's house and see what was going on.

The next day, Donny came over, and we all went with her. 
Donny sat Monika down in a chair in the middle of the living room and asked her to close her eyes. 
Then, in a real medium-like fashion, Donny started moving her hands a little distance above Monika, from the top of her head, over her shoulders, down to her heart, and all the way to her toes, as if she was feeling her energy. She told Monika that she was going into a sort of subconscious trance.

This took about 30 seconds, and then Monika started to turn pale. She began crying and convulsing, sliding off the chair onto the floor. 
Donny touched her shoulder, and Monika suddenly stopped and woke up. She sat back in her chair, looking dazed as she started to wake up. Donny asked her, ""What did you see?"" and Monika said, ""It's my grandmother.""

She wanted Monika to know that she was really sorry about the way she treated her in life, that she had always given her the feeling that her older sister was the golden child. Monika had felt like her grandmother loved her sister more than she loved her, but that wasn’t the case. Her grandmother loved them both equally and really wanted to apologize. She wanted Monika to know that she truly did love her just as much.
Donny asked Monika if she loved her grandmother, and if she forgave her, and if so to speak the words out loud.
She sad yes and did so out loud.

After that day, no more weird things happened. Nothing moved. The energy in the house was lifted, and Monika never felt watched again.

This was the day I started to believe in the supernatural.

1g16veq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g16veq/home_harmony_how_to_blend_home_decor_and/,Home Harmony: How to Blend Home Decor and Furniture for a Cohesive Look,"Achieving a beautifully styled home is all about balance. When home decor items and furniture come together harmoniously, your space feels cohesive, inviting, and visually appealing. Blending the two requires an eye for detail, a touch of creativity, and a clear understanding of your style. In this guide, we’ll explore how to seamlessly integrate [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) with decor items—creating harmony in every corner of your home.

**1. Establish a Color Palette**

The first step in blending home decor and furniture is to establish a cohesive color palette. Whether you prefer neutral tones or bold shades, maintaining consistency in your color scheme helps unify the space. 

Tip: Choose furniture pieces like sofas, bar stools, or coffee tables in neutral or natural hues and complement them with home decor items like cushions, vases, and throws that feature pops of color. For instance, if your bar stools are wooden or metal, adding decorative cushions or artwork with similar tones can tie the look together.

**2. Balance Proportions with Furniture and Decor**

Proportion is key when blending home furniture and decor. Large furniture pieces should be paired with appropriately sized decor to maintain balance in the room. For instance, if you have a large sectional sofa, balance it with equally sizable decor like a large rug or oversized wall art.

Tip: Incorporate [pendant lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) or [hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) above your dining table or living room to create vertical balance. These lighting elements not only add ambiance but also help define spaces without overwhelming the room.

**3. Mix Materials for Visual Interest**

Mixing different materials—such as wood, metal, glass, and fabric—adds depth and texture to a room. When blending home decor and furniture, be mindful of the finishes and materials to ensure they complement each other.

Example: If you have a wooden dining table with sleek [bar stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools), soften the look with fabric elements like upholstered chairs or textured cushions. Add a [ceramic vase](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) or a metallic tray as a centerpiece to introduce contrasting materials for added dimension.

**4. Use Statement Pieces to Anchor the Room**

A well-placed statement piece can serve as the focal point of your room and anchor the overall design. Whether it's a bold piece of furniture like a brightly colored armchair or eye-catching decor like pendant lights, statement pieces can elevate your room’s style.

Tip: Try using a statement pendant light or a striking piece of art to draw attention to specific areas. Hanging lights above a kitchen island with stylish bar stools can create a sophisticated look while ensuring the lighting adds both function and style to the space.

**5. Layer Lighting for a Cozy Atmosphere**

Lighting plays a crucial role in creating a cohesive look. Layering different types of lighting, such as pendant lights, table lamps, and floor lamps, creates depth and warmth in any room.

Example: Install hanging lights or pendant lights over dining areas to create a focused yet welcoming environment. Pair these with floor lamps in living areas to softly illuminate dark corners and enhance the overall mood. By layering light sources, you create a balanced and cohesive atmosphere that highlights both your home decor items and furniture.

**6. Update Seasonally with Smaller Decor Items**

You don’t have to completely overhaul your space to keep it fresh. Instead, update your home seasonally by switching out smaller decor items. This allows you to maintain a cohesive foundation with your main furniture pieces while adding new elements to refresh your space.

Tip: Swap out items like throw pillows, table decor, or artwork to reflect different seasons. For example, light linen cushions in summer and rich velvet ones in winter can complement your existing furniture without disrupting the room’s harmony.

Creating harmony between [home decor items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) and home furniture is all about balance. By coordinating colors, mixing materials, and layering lighting elements like pendant lights and hanging lights, you can create a beautifully cohesive space. Don’t forget to introduce statement pieces like bar stools or unique lighting to make certain areas pop while maintaining an overall sense of unity. With these tips, your home will not only look well-designed but also feel like the perfect reflection of your style.

Once she even suggested to go for a walk outside the office.

On Tuesday this week I randomly sent her a meme that made me think of her and after that she started randomly sending me messages too. (That is all in the company Slack, we don't have each others phone numbers yet.)

Yesterday I wasn't at the office but she sent me a message that she is there and brought chocolate and if I wanted some, I could come - which I did. At the office we were chatting a bit and I mentioned that a night of open museums is happening soon and she said she wants to go and we could have a look what museums we'd be interested in.

Now my issue is that I honestly don't know how to continue this. I really like her a lot and would be interested in dating her but I'm not that experienced. I don't know how to progress from colleagues that I assume like each other, to dating.

I'm not good at flirting and I definitely don't want to be inappropriate in the workplace. And to be honest I'm not even sure if she is romantically interested in me. I kind of want to think she doesn't just see me as a friend because for the past few days every morning she's been sending me messages and pictures and if I had a colleague I saw just as a friend, I probably wouldn't strike up a conversation with them every day.

Still I can't be sure but I also don't want to do nothing. For you it might be obvious what I should do next but I'm really not that experienced so I'd love to hear your ideas and thoughts.",1,1728643199.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

It’s a place where you can enjoy your cigars in comfort and style, without worrying about disturbing others. However, creating the perfect cigar lounge at home requires some thought and attention to detail. From proper ventilation to maintaining your cigars in peak condition, this guide will walk you through how to set up an ideal space and practice good cigar etiquette at home.

# 1. Choose the Right Space: Indoors vs. Outdoors

* **Indoors:** If you plan on smoking indoors, make sure the space is well-ventilated and separated from other living areas. Popular choices for indoor smoking lounges include basements, dens, or a converted garage. It's essential to install a high-quality ventilation system or an air purifier to control smoke and odor.
* **Outdoors:** If indoor smoking isn’t an option, an outdoor patio, porch, or garden area can work perfectly. Just ensure you have comfortable seating, adequate lighting for nighttime smoking, and some shelter from the elements like a pergola or retractable awning.

**Pro Tip:** No matter where you set up, consider the airflow and the experience of others who may not appreciate the lingering scent of cigars.

# 2. Ventilation: Key to a Comfortable Space

* **Why It’s Important:** Poor ventilation can leave your home smelling like stale smoke for days. Even if you’re the only one enjoying cigars, you don’t want the lingering odor to ruin the atmosphere for future smoking sessions.
* **Ventilation Options:**
   * **Exhaust Fans:** Install exhaust fans or smoke-eater units specifically designed for cigar rooms to keep the air fresh.
   * **Air Purifiers:** Invest in a high-quality air purifier with HEPA filters and carbon filters to trap both smoke and odors.
   * **Open Windows:** If your budget doesn’t allow for more advanced solutions, cracking open windows and using fans can provide a basic level of ventilation.

**Pro Tip:** Some cigar aficionados use scented candles or incense designed for cigar lounges to help mask the smoke, but good ventilation should always be the first step.

# 3. Comfortable Seating: Relax in Style

* **Why It’s Important:** A great cigar experience requires comfort. When setting up your home smoking space, invest in high-quality, comfortable seating that can accommodate long smoking sessions.
* **Seating Ideas:**
   * **Leather Armchairs or Sofas:** Leather is a popular choice because it’s durable, stylish, and easy to clean. Smoke doesn’t cling to leather as it does to fabric, making it a more practical option.
   * **Outdoor Lounge Chairs:** For outdoor spaces, weather-resistant lounge chairs are a must. Look for something cushioned for maximum comfort.

**Pro Tip:** Consider adding a small table next to your chair for placing your drink, ashtray, and cigar accessories within easy reach.

# 4. The Right Humidor: Keeping Your Cigars Fresh

* **Why It’s Important:** Once you’ve created a perfect space for smoking, it’s essential to maintain your cigars in top condition. A well-maintained humidor is a must for ensuring your cigars stay fresh, flavorful, and ready to smoke.
* **Humidor Essentials:**
   * **Size:** Choose a humidor that suits your collection. If you’re just starting out, a small desktop humidor that holds 25-50 cigars may be enough. For larger collections, consider a humidor cabinet.
   * **Humidity Control:** Ensure your humidor is equipped with a hygrometer and humidification system to maintain 65-70% humidity. You can use humidity packs, beads, or electronic humidifiers for ease of maintenance.

**Pro Tip:** If you plan on aging cigars, invest in a larger humidor or a climate-controlled cabinet to ensure consistency over the long term.

# 5. Cigar Accessories: Keeping Things Tidy

* **Why It’s Important:** The right accessories not only enhance your smoking experience but also help keep your space organized and neat. From ashtrays to cutters, having everything within reach makes for a more enjoyable smoke.
* **Must-Have Accessories:**
   * **Ashtray:** A large, deep ashtray designed for cigars is essential. Look for ones with multiple stirrups for holding cigars between puffs.
   * **Cutter & Lighter:** Keep a good-quality cutter and butane lighter on hand. A single torch lighter works for most, but you might want to invest in a triple or quad torch for larger ring gauge cigars.
   * **Cigar Rest:** A cigar rest or holder is perfect for setting down your cigar without risking it rolling off the table or getting dirty.

**Pro Tip:** Keep a small storage box or tray near your smoking area to organize your accessories and keep them easily accessible.

# 6. Music and Ambiance: Set the Mood

* **Why It’s Important:** The perfect cigar experience isn’t just about the smoke—it’s about the ambiance. Music can elevate the mood, creating a relaxing or celebratory atmosphere depending on your preferences.
* **Ambiance Tips:**
   * **Music:** Set up a sound system or portable speaker to play your favorite jazz, blues, or classical music. Many aficionados prefer slow, relaxing tunes to match the leisurely pace of cigar smoking.
   * **Lighting:** Soft, dim lighting is ideal for indoor spaces. Use table lamps or low-hanging lights to create a cozy vibe. If you’re outdoors, string lights or lanterns can add warmth and elegance to your space.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid overly bright lighting or loud music that distracts from the relaxing nature of smoking a cigar.

# 7. Cigar Etiquette: Smoking at Home with Others

* **Why It’s Important:** Even in your own home, practicing good cigar etiquette is important—especially if you live with others or invite guests over to join you for a smoke.
* **Etiquette Tips:**
   * **Communicate:** Let others in the house know when you’re going to smoke so they can avoid the area if they don’t want to be around the smoke.
   * **Be Considerate with Ventilation:** Always run your ventilation system or air purifier, even when smoking alone. This keeps the air fresh and reduces lingering odors.
   * **Offer Guests a Choice:** If you invite friends over for a cigar, offer them a selection of cigars and make sure you have enough accessories (cutters, lighters) to go around. It’s also good form to offer drinks that pair well with cigars, like whiskey or rum.

**Pro Tip:** Keep a separate set of cutters and lighters for guests to use—many aficionados prefer to use their own tools for their cigars.

# 8. Drink Pairings: Enhance the Experience

* **Why It’s Important:** Pairing cigars with the right drink can enhance both the flavors of the cigar and the beverage. Create a mini-bar in your smoking area for easy access to drinks.
* **Popular Pairings:**
   * **Whiskey & Bourbon:** Bold, full-bodied cigars often pair beautifully with aged whiskey or bourbon. Keep a bottle or two on hand for guests or your own enjoyment.
   * **Coffee:** For morning or midday smoking sessions, coffee is a classic pairing. Set up a small coffee station to enjoy fresh brews with your cigars.
   * **Rum & Cognac:** Sweet rums and cognacs can complement the earthy, spicy flavors of a cigar, especially those with Maduro wrappers.

**Pro Tip:** Experiment with different drink pairings based on the strength and flavor profile of your cigars to find the perfect match.

# Final Thoughts:

Creating the perfect smoking space at home is all about comfort, ambiance, and respect for others around you. Whether you’re setting up indoors or outdoors, investing in proper ventilation, comfortable seating, and quality cigar storage will ensure that your smoking sessions are enjoyable and hassle-free. With the right accessories, ambiance, and etiquette, you can turn your home cigar lounge into a haven for relaxation and indulgence.

1g16luz,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalscribe/comments/1g16luz/the_chief_scribe_is_highly_unprofessional/,The chief scribe is highly unprofessional ,"My chief has been working with SA company for over 6 years. All this time, she has had a bad crush on a particular physician who knows about the chief’s feelings but does not reciprocate. In fact, the entire hospital knows as the chief managed to earn several inappropriate and ridiculous nicknames by other veteran/seasoned physicians. The chief usually brings food and coffee for her favorite doctor and  deliberately messes with everyone’s schedule to schedule herself with the doc she has feelings for. Essentially, she is mentally checked out at work. Her entire attention is the physician she loves who knows about her feelings but doesn’t give a damn.  Instead, that physician takes advantage of her kindness and takes everything he can from her (food, coffee, good schedule, etc). In other words,  the chief seeks validation from the doctor, and he feeds off of her attention. 
You may ask why do I care? 
Well, that chief has been unprofessional with other fellow scribes. She badly messes up with everyone’s schedule and refuses to help fix it although she is very often at fault. She also refuses to listen to other attending physicians and take into account their preferences when it comes to having scribes.
To top it off, if she finds out any scribe has complained to higher-ups about something that she initially was made aware of but decided to dismiss or ignore, she becomes revengeful and retaliatory. She waits some time, then sets the scribes up with serious accusations and brings that issue up to the higher-ups. Then, the fellow scribes get pestered by the higher-ups about their “unprofessional behavior” while not even being aware of the whole situation. There are unfortunately way too many examples, but I will keep it short: Two of the well-seasoned scribes were badly set up for something they never did. They were set up in a very similar pattern but at different timelines to be less suspicious of course. The chief made up a story that “a lot of docs and nurses complain about these scribes for cussing and using vulgar jokes” and told the higher-ups about it. She would never mention any physicians’ names to keep them “anonymous”. But that seemed to be a tactic to prevent the scribes face their accuser. Long story short, both scribes got written warnings from the higher ups who didn’t even want to listen to them to get their side of the story. The first scribe got in trouble like this half a year ago, the second scribe a month ago. 
Both quit their jobs. All they did back in their days was addressing the issues they were having with the chief’s incompetence at making the schedule. Both these scribes, especially the second one were and still are very much loved and missed by many docs and the medical personnel. 
But the chief is acting like she owns everyone and everything just because she is a bit delulu and thinks she is “besties” with the doc she is desperately in love with. Even some residents cannot stand her as she tries to boss them around anytime they are staffing with her favorite doctor. 
There are other unprofessional things she does, like sending rude direct messages when getting paranoid about random things or accusing the scribes of complaining on her. 
Meanwhile, many old docs do not like her and tend to use nicknames behind her back. 
Sorry, this is me ranting because it is not fair to others. For the last several months, most of the OG scribes quit because of her. 
Not sure if any of you have encountered such a messy situation.
