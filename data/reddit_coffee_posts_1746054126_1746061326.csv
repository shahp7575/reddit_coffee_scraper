Now all at once they want back in my life and are stalking me. I finally confronted them.,"I don't really know if this counts as an update so much as it does as maybe just information that I have and was given. First to answer a common question. 

Am I going to seek out my siblings and their families.  The answer is no.  And that answer is set in stone.  And the reason is relatively simple.  At least to me.  My siblings are two and four years younger than I am.  So when everything happen they were old enough to understand and know what was happening.  I waited for a year and half before I changed my last name and all my contact information.  They could have easily reached out to me, stood up our parents and come to my defense.  But they did not.  So now all this time later I just don't feel the need to contact them or reconnect. To be completely honest.  They are complete and total strangers and I really don't see much of a reason reconnect.

People have been asking if I'm okay.  The answer is yes.  I'm feeling a lot better.  This got to much in my head.  But I realized that I was way over thinking this.  Nothing really changes. I have not heard from any of them.  My best friend took me to his lawyer and I gave him everything and told him everything.  He said that since reputation and family name are so important that a simple cease and desist letter should do the job.  That he was sure my family wouldn't want their reputation and story splashed across the local news. I also fee like because of my cousin I in general feel better about things as well.  

Hell hath no fury like my cousin Jean pissed off.  The other day Jean called and said that we need to take a day and go do something.  Get out of town and just forget about everything.  I agreed with no thought to it.  We always have a great time when we do an outing.  This I got to her place and immediately went up to her kitchen for coffee to figure out what we were going to do. I got to the kitchen and she had a bunch of papers scattered out doing a bunch of research.  I asked what she was working on.  Her response.  ""Your parents pissed me off.  All I want to do is go over to their house and beat the hell out of both of them."" She took a drink of her coffee.  ""Lets talk names again."" She started to research our lineage and realized some things.  She told me that if there was still anything left of our last name (businesses and family money) she was almost 100% certain that I would be the sole heir to anything left if there was anything left. I asked how this was possible. That if anything it would be her husbands remaining siblings, and any children from those survivors.  She said it was because of my Grandmother that she was one of the original's (for a lack of words) I was born under the last name and even though my parents changed it later I changed it back.  She said it could be considered along the lines of succession.  My Grandmother was an original.  All I could do was just kind of laugh.  Its so funny how vested she is in this. I made the comment ""It all sounds good and it would be nice. But that if her one sister in law had anything to say about it she and her family would have taken it all by now.  They already got the farm."" Jean ended it with ""I would have helped you get what was rightfully yours."" I don't think she is completely accurate.  But it's a fun thought. I laugh at how vested she is in this situation.  I think it makes me that much more grateful to have her in my life. After that we took off for the rest of the day and went shopping, had lunch, went and had manni's and pedi's done, and had dinner.  

But I'm good.  I think we are good.  I truly don't think I'll hear anything from my family.  I think once they get the letter it will all be done and over.

1kbwc4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kbwc4e/my_landlords_are_driving_me_insane/,My landlords are driving me insane,"I live in a rented attached house, and my landlords are also my neighbours. They are a nice elderly couple, but recently I've been having issues with them. A lot of it has to deal with their complete lack of boundaries and the longer my partner and I stay here, the worse it gets. There isn't much of a point about discussing those previous times, but there resentment is there and it keeps building up.

Before I begin, I suppose a bit of back story is in order. I'm a very private person, who also happens physically disabled. I was forced to discuss a lot of my medical issues with them a couple of months ago, when they decided to completely tear our bathroom apart, claiming it was because of a leak. They said it was going to be a one day repair, but it ended up being over a week, not counting the mess we'd to deal with afterwards. I even to go stay a hotel after third day because they I was unable to use the bathroom at its current state. That is not what I'm here to vent about, but it was import because I had to discuss my medical issues with them, to stress that their casual way of dealing with this was impacting my health quite severely. One of these issues is my pretty terrible insomnia. 

So today a package came for me, it was a small thing, no larger than my hand and it cost less than 2 USD. I had only managed to fall asleep at around 6AM, but I was woken up at around 10AM when the mailman was calling me to inform me about the delivery. I was groggy and wasn't able to fully process what was happening before my phone stopped vibrating. While I was trying to get myself awake enough in order to call back, I got the text confirmation that my package was delivered and my doorbell was rung once. My landlord must have picked it up, which is a pretty common occurrence since only their door faces the street. I chose to ignore it, which is something that I do pretty often and that has never been an issue before. They know I leave the house several times during the day to smoke, toss the garbage. I've had several packages sit outside for a while, from computer pieces that were clearly labelled as so, to massive boxes of over 20kg of cat litter. Some times these packages will stay on my porch until my partner comes back so I don't kill myself trying to move them. It never happened that a package wasn't picked up on the same day. 

Today was day that my landlord decided I really must pick up this tiny thing. One of them came back to vigorously ring my doorbell at 1PM. Assuming I woke up after the first ring, they must have rang it over 4 times. That kind of frantic ringing when something is very urgent. I woke up panicking and I immediately knew I'd not be able to fall back asleep. I knew it was my landlord, and also I knew it was about this package. I was so angry, not only just because I feel more pain the less I sleep, but also because they know I cannot move fast. I can't just get up and quickly toss some clothes on and rush to the door. I just laid in bed for a couple of minutes, literally fuming and made the decision to say fuck it and proceed with my normal morning routine. I made coffee, used the toilet, brushed my teeth and hair, got dressed and put my braces on before I even considered to deal with this situation. 

When I finally opened the door, there it was, on my doormat, as if mocking me. So small and its contents so cheap and unimportant. I quickly shoved it on the shelf, after briefly considering tossing it straight into the trash, and went smoke a cigarette. The landlord immediately opens their door to ask if I got the package. I reply that I did, and thanked him. I'm still proud of myself for not yelling. I still have no idea why they deemed this package so important that they needed to wake me up for it. They know I've terrible insomnia and that I usually wake up after 10AM because of it, they've seen me literally fall apart because of it during the bathroom remodeling. I probably lost over 15kg since the end of 2024 because I have been getting worse, I'm afraid to even check my weight, but now I can fit clothes I have from my early 20's(I'm on my early 30's now). It's pretty apparent that I'm not doing well, and 
I wasn't able to sleep more than 5 interrupted hours because of this stupid package. 

I don't even know why this angered me this much, I suppose it was a last drop in a sea of recent grievances. It's nearly 3AM and I'm still fuming. If you made it this far, I hope this was at least moderately entertaining to read.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The allure of gold candles extends beyond their visual appeal. Understanding the technical specifications and design elements is crucial in selecting a candle that not only looks beautiful but also performs well.

**Wax Type:** Different waxes impact burn time, scent throw, and environmental impact.

Gold candles are available in various wax types, including paraffin, soy, beeswax, and blends. Paraffin wax is a traditional choice, known for its strong scent throw and affordability. However, soy wax, derived from soybeans, is a more sustainable and eco-friendly option. Beeswax, a natural wax produced by bees, offers a clean burn and a subtle honey scent. Many premium gold candles utilize proprietary wax blends to optimize both scent diffusion and burn performance. Choosing the right wax type depends on your priorities, whether it's maximum fragrance, environmental consciousness, or a long-lasting burn.

**Scent Profile:** The fragrance infused in a gold candle significantly impacts its overall ambiance.

The scent profile of a gold candle can range from floral and fruity to woody and spicy. Some candles feature essential oils for aromatherapy benefits, while others use synthetic fragrances for a more complex and long-lasting aroma. The intensity of the scent, known as the scent throw, is also an important consideration. A strong scent throw is ideal for larger spaces, while a more subtle fragrance is better suited for smaller rooms. When selecting a gold candle, consider the time of year, the intended mood, and your personal fragrance preferences.

**Container Material and Design:** The container not only holds the wax but also contributes to the candle's overall aesthetic.

Gold candles are often housed in metallic containers, glass jars with gold accents, or ceramic vessels with gilded details. The material and design of the container influence the candle's visual appeal and heat resistance. Metallic containers can create a dramatic and luxurious look, while glass jars offer a more classic and versatile option. Ceramic containers provide a unique and artisanal feel. The design of the container can range from minimalist and modern to ornate and traditional, allowing you to choose a candle that complements your existing decor.

**Burn Time and Wick Type:** Burn time indicates how long a candle will last, while wick type affects the quality of the burn.

The burn time of a gold candle depends on its size, wax type, and wick type. A longer burn time provides greater value and ensures that you can enjoy the candle for an extended period. The wick type also plays a crucial role in the candle's performance. Cotton wicks are a common choice, providing a consistent and reliable burn. Wood wicks, on the other hand, create a crackling sound that adds to the ambiance. The proper wick size is essential for achieving an even burn and preventing tunneling, which is when the wax only melts in the center of the candle.

 ## Core Benefits

Beyond their aesthetic charm, gold candles offer several practical and emotional benefits that make them a worthwhile addition to any home.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** The warm, inviting glow of a gold candle creates a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. The metallic finish reflects light, adding a touch of sophistication and glamour to any space. Whether you're hosting a dinner party, enjoying a quiet evening at home, or creating a spa-like atmosphere in your bathroom, a gold candle can instantly elevate the ambiance. The flickering flame provides a soothing visual effect, helping to reduce stress and promote relaxation.

**Improved Mood:** Scented gold candles can positively influence your mood and emotions. Certain fragrances, such as lavender and chamomile, are known for their calming and relaxing properties. Citrus scents, like lemon and grapefruit, can invigorate and uplift your spirits. Woody scents, such as sandalwood and cedarwood, can create a sense of grounding and stability. By choosing a gold candle with a fragrance that aligns with your desired mood, you can enhance your overall well-being and create a more positive and enjoyable environment.

**Stylish Decoration:** Gold candles serve as versatile decorative elements that can complement a wide range of interior design styles. Whether your home decor is modern, traditional, bohemian, or minimalist, a gold candle can add a touch of elegance and sophistication. They can be displayed on coffee tables, bookshelves, mantels, or even as centerpieces on dining tables. The metallic finish of the gold container adds a luxurious touch, while the flickering flame provides a warm and inviting glow. Gold candles can also be used to create a focal point in a room, drawing the eye and adding visual interest.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions helps prospective buyers make informed choices about gold candles.

**What is the best way to care for a gold candle to ensure a long burn time?**

To maximize the burn time of your gold candle, it's essential to trim the wick to about 1/4 inch before each use. This helps prevent smoking and ensures a clean, even burn. Allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during the first use to create a full melt pool, which will prevent tunneling. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time, as this can overheat the wax and reduce its lifespan. Keep the candle away from drafts and flammable materials, and always extinguish it properly with a snuffer or by gently blowing it out.

**Are gold candles safe to use around pets and children?**

While gold candles can add a beautiful ambiance to your home, it's crucial to prioritize safety when using them around pets and children. Keep candles out of reach of pets and children to prevent accidental burns or ingestion of the wax. Never leave a burning candle unattended, and ensure that it is placed on a stable surface away from curtains, paper, or other flammable materials. Consider using flameless LED candles as a safer alternative if you have young children or pets who are prone to knocking things over.

**How can I remove wax residue from a gold candle container for reuse?**

To remove wax residue from a gold candle container for reuse, first, place the container in the freezer for a few hours. This will cause the wax to shrink and harden, making it easier to remove. Once the wax is frozen, use a spoon or butter knife to gently pry it out of the container. If any wax residue remains, wash the container with warm, soapy water and dry it thoroughly. You can also use a hairdryer to melt any stubborn wax residue, then wipe it away with a paper towel. Once the container is clean and dry, you can repurpose it for storage, as a planter, or for other decorative purposes.

Investing in a high-quality 30-cup coffee maker translates into numerous practical benefits, particularly for those who regularly need to serve coffee to large groups. From improved efficiency to cost savings, the advantages are significant.

**Time Efficiency:** Brewing 30 cups of coffee in a single batch significantly reduces the time and effort required compared to using smaller coffee makers multiple times. This time-saving aspect is invaluable in busy office environments or during large events where efficiency is crucial.

Navigating the features and functionalities of a 30-cup coffee maker can sometimes raise questions. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions to help clarify any doubts you might have.

**How easy is it to clean a 30-cup coffee maker?**
    Most 30-cup coffee makers are designed for easy cleaning. Removable parts, such as the filter basket and carafe, are often dishwasher-safe. Regular descaling is also recommended to maintain optimal performance and prevent mineral buildup.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee or do I need to grind my own beans?**

**What type of filter does a 30-cup coffee maker use?**
    Many 30-cup coffee makers use paper filters, which are disposable and easy to replace. Some models may also come with a permanent, reusable filter, which can be cleaned and reused, reducing waste.

**Is it possible to brew less than 30 cups if I don鈥檛 need that much coffee?**
    Yes, most 30-cup coffee makers allow you to brew smaller batches of coffee. The water level indicator helps you measure the appropriate amount of water for the desired number of cups.

1kbw83n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1kbw83n/im_being_watched_in_my_own_apartment/,I'm Being Watched in My Own Apartment,"I never believed in the paranormal until last month. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment in an older building downtown - nothing special, just a regular place with thin walls and questionable plumbing. The rent is affordable, which is all that matters in this economy.

It started with small things I could easily dismiss. Keys not where I left them. Water running when I was sure I'd turned it off. The feeling of cold spots in the hallway even when the heat was on full blast.

Then came the footsteps.

I first heard them three weeks ago while I was falling asleep. Light footsteps crossing my living room floor. I bolted upright, heart racing, convinced someone had broken in. I grabbed my phone ready to call 911 and carefully checked every corner of my tiny apartment. Nothing. No signs of forced entry, windows still locked.

I blamed it on the upstairs neighbor, though it was nearly 2 AM.

Two nights later, it happened again. This time, I distinctly heard the footsteps walk from my living room to the foot of my bed. I lay completely still, paralyzed with fear, my eyes squeezed shut. The footsteps stopped right next to me. I could feel a presence there, standing, watching. The air felt heavy and cold, and I couldn't breathe.

I finally gathered the courage to open my eyes. Nothing was there, but my bedroom door was now closed. I always sleep with it open.

The following week, things escalated. I woke up to find all the kitchen cabinet doors wide open. Then my shower turned on by itself while I was cooking dinner. I called maintenance, but they found nothing wrong with the plumbing.

Last Sunday, I returned from grocery shopping to find a single wet footprint in the middle of my bathroom floor. It wasn't mine - it was much smaller, like a child's.

I finally broke down and asked my elderly neighbor if anyone had ever died in my unit. Her face went pale. She told me a young woman had lived there in the 1980s who'd had mental health issues. They found her in the bathtub after she hadn't been seen for days. The neighbor mentioned something that made my blood run cold - the woman had always complained about hearing footsteps at night when no one was there.

Last night was the worst. I woke up at 3 AM to the sound of my closet door creaking open. As I lay frozen in bed, I heard what sounded like someone quietly rifling through my clothes. The hangers made a distinct metallic sound as they slid across the rod. I finally worked up the courage to turn on my lamp, and the sound immediately stopped. The closet door was open about six inches, though I always keep it firmly shut because the latch is broken.

When I checked this morning, nothing was missing, but all my hanging clothes were pushed to one side, bunched together as if someone had been looking through them.

I'm writing this from a coffee shop because I'm afraid to go home. I told my coworker about it, and she thinks I should set up a camera. But honestly, I'm afraid of what I might see.

I don't know what to do. My lease locks me in for another 8 months, and I can't afford to break it. I'm sleeping with the lights on tonight, but I don't think it will help.

She knows I can sense her now, and I think that's exactly what she wanted.

1. OR, WA, MO and WY.
2. CA, NV, UT, AZ.

The focus would be on visiting major national parks. But I feel like the southwest would have the best food but would be more flat with mostly desert. The northwest would have the best weather and mountain views and probably the best coffee.

I’m going to tell you how this is a massive problem AND how to start solving it.  
  
We all experience the same thing. **We see everything in our lives through a filter that harms us.**  
  
Consider a coffee filter. Its job is to let the good stuff through - the coffee, while it holds back what you don’t want - the coffee grounds.  
  
Your brain naturally does this too.   
  
**Unfortunately, it’s not designed to filter out what we don’t want.**   
  
It filters based on ALL of your past experiences and it’s designed to remind you of the bad ones.  
  
That means the way you see the world in regards to your relationships, your opportunities, and even yourself - is filtered through everything you’ve already lived through.

If you’ve experienced rejection, your brain looks for signs of rejection, even if it’s not there.   
  
If you’ve been through failure, it’ll scan for ways things might go wrong.

**Every single one of our filters is broken**.  
  
It’s like we’re walking around like a pot of coffee that’s filled with coffee grinds!   
  
Have you ever drank coffee grinds? It’s bad.  
  
**The solution to this problem is to change your filter every single time you experience a problem. Every time.**   
  
**Changing your filter means changing your perspective.**   
  
That’s worth repeating: If you want to change your life you have to change your perspective on all of your problems.  
  
**The fastest way to do that is through asking yourself powerful questions.**   
  
“What else could be true here?”   
“What’s the opportunity in this challenge?”   
“What would I do if I wasn’t afraid?”   
“What am I learning right now?”  
  
**Asking yourself the right question shifts your perspective to become helpful, instead of unhelpful.**   
  
It’s like changing the filter on life.  
  
So question yourself, question your reality, and create a helpful filter for your life.

We’d matched on Tinder, and he invited me for coffee. I was immediately enamored with him when we met. I thought he didn’t like me, but he asked me out again, and we went on several more dates. I lost my virginity to him. He then broke up with me a few months after we’d started dating. 

A year and a half or so after that, I texted him, and we ended up meeting for coffee again. He seemed a lot more animated. This was late 2019. I was still stupidly in love with him, but I was trying to keep my expectations low. We kept going on dates. In February 2020 he invited me to his friend’s Valentine’s Day party, then pulled me aside and told me he loved me. I told him I loved him too. Then oops, Covid happened. 

My parents made me move back in with them. I was 21 and still didn’t know how to say no to them, so I went with it. A couple months into Covid, my boyfriend was offering a place in his apartment for me. I couldn’t stand being with my parents a second longer, so I told them I was moving in with him and there was nothing they could do about it. My mother had a mental breakdown driving me to his place, and that was his first impression of my mother.

We lived in that house for about 2 months before his landlord decided he was selling the house. From there, we moved to an apartment with a couple of his friends in a neighborhood that was a food desert. I was employed and he was not, so I bought us groceries, sometimes carrying them 3 miles uphill and sometimes just getting Instacart. One day, he was acting really weird and distant, and our roommates were also acting really weird. He asked me to go on a walk with him. I thought he was going to break up with me. Instead, when we got to the river, he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was still 21. I said yes because I knew we’d have to break up if I said no. The ring he bought me was $300 on Etsy; I remember being upset that he’d spent that on a ring instead of helping us buy groceries. We’d been together officially for less than 6 months.

I stayed with him for 2 more years. We got a 1bdr apartment together. We got a cat together. As weird as I felt about the proposal, I loved him deeply. He is the only person I’ve ever been in love with. I was the one to break up with him, though. That was over 3 years ago.

He has never forgiven me for it. The breakup was initially amicable. We agreed we would stay civil. But a couple months after the breakup, he suddenly texted me that if he ever saw me again, he would knock me out on sight. Shortly afterwards, he released his first EP, in which he sang about how he wished I was dead, and how now that he carries a gun he hopes he sees me again.

I have only seen him once since then, at a bus stop, and I immediately walked away and called my new boyfriend at the time. That was over 2 years ago. 

That new boyfriend who I called ended up being comically abusive, and I stayed with him for about a year and a half because I am stupid. The boyfriend I had after that guy was not abusive, but told me he loved me via emojis after less than two months, and I noped out. 

I now really miss my ex. It may be because he was the first person I was ever in love with, it may be because he was the first person I ever actually dated, it may be because he was the first person I ever fucked. I think a part of me is angry that he has that many of my firsts and doesn’t share them. He was already really experienced when we first had sex, and he’d already been on a ton of dates on our first date. I don’t feel this way about any of my other exes. I’m glad I’m not in contact with them, but I want to be in contact with him.

Managed to lose 17.7kg (39lbs) so far. Clothes are definitely looser on me and pants I used to struggle to fit in now require a belt.

Not strict carnivore but the bulk of my diet is carnivore. After the first two weeks where I dropped 7kg (mostly water weight) have settled into a steady routine which has seen me losing around a kilo a week since then.

Experimented with a bunch of no/low carb recipes. Most of them were hits but had a miss as well. Recipes like carnivore cottage pie, carnivore flatbread and carnivore angel bread all were hits. However when I used almond flour in recipes that was a big miss. The three days I used it I ended putting on 1.6kg so that was a minor setback. 

Daily diet for me involves 80g of macadamia's. Rather than eating butter I prefer this. Technically not carnivore but it's the best way for me to get my fat content up. Been doing it since late Feb and it works for me. Some days 4 eggs, bacon with some cheese for lunch. Some days might skip it. Dinner will be either steak/lamb chops/chicken or pork.

\--------------------

**My notes and what weird things I noticed**

(1) - It is pretty confusing which kiss between Alec and Magnus is actually the first, because they have three first kisses in The Bane Chronicles.  
The chapter ""What to buy a shadowhunter who has everything (and who you're not officially dating anyway)"" mentions that they are together at Taki's and later kiss outside, leaning against a wall. Magnus describes that he is aware that this is Alec's first date and kiss.  
In the chapter ""The Course of First Love (and First Dates),"" Alec invites Magnus on a date on Tuesday, to which Magnus responds by accepting the invitation and kissing him. However, the first kiss doesn't happen until later in the chapter, when they return from their date to Magnus's house.  
However, this may be a translation error since I am reading Bane's chronicles in Czech. In the first chapter, it may be meant that this is Alec's dating and first kisses in general, not this specific one. When accepting the date, the kiss could have been on the cheek. And then the real first kiss happens Friday after the date.

(2) I tried to figure out how they could travel through the portal so that it would make sense with the time zones, since there should be a six-hour time difference between New York and Idris (CED). Jace told Clary that they would travel in the evening. But the sun's rays reflected off the surface when Clary went through the portal in the evening and exited the lake in Idris.  
The only solution I couldn't come up with was for Jace to tell her they would travel through the portal between midnight and 1 a.m. But then it doesn't make sense that Luke says the lake is several hours' walk from Alicante, but they don't arrive in the city until dusk.  
Cassandra Clare may have mixed the time zones when writing this and thought Idris was six hours behind New York. That would explain a lot. Unfortunately, time zones work differently, and this is the best I could come up with.",3,1746059179.0,shadowhunters,1,1.0,False

I had a stomach bug from Friday until Sunday. I only puked once but had insane diarrhea until Sunday. I had a fever all day Friday as well. I sanitized as much as possible, but last night and today my husband has been having diarrhea. I was maybe hoping that yesterday was because he hadn’t pooped in 4 days, drank coffee and it all just flooded his system, but considering he’s still having it today I’m not so sure. He has not puked and he feels okay, just lower stomach cramping. No fever for my husband. 

But I am so worried for my almost 3 year old. He shoves his fingers in his mouth 24/7. I was thinking he was in the clear from my symptoms but now that my husband is having diarrhea the incubation period has now restarted for my toddler. If he does get this bug, I hope it’s just diarrhea for him too, although I feel like he’ll wind up puking. He throws up with common colds so I don’t see why this would be any different.

At least I can’t catch it if my son gets it, but I’m still worried about him throwing up everywhere.

Mashu notes how there’s more strange building up ahead. Irene says that she lives there and that the residents there are pretty boring because they just pray all the time with no care for essential necessities like food or water. Irene notes how random it is and Kadoc comments how insane it is.

https://preview.redd.it/p28wj9av51ye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c62099f5e2170d3daceeef4badc5d28d5db32c1

Irene sees beasts up ahead, so she demands you, as her bodyguard, to defeat them. Irene asks if princesses should always be protected in cases like this, but Kadoc replies that it’s not always like that. Irene gives up and just fights beside you.

After the battle, Irene notes how very conservative Mashu’s fighting style is.

**Mashu:**

>It’s because I’m a Shielder…

**Mashu:**

>Indeed.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>It’s okay because it's one of a kind!

Irene states that they’ve arrived at the safehouse. Kadoc and Mashu are shocked at how normal this building is compared to the rest they’ve seen. Irene asks if the manager is there. Someone comes and says that they’re there but normally never comes out.

https://preview.redd.it/3ezir4px51ye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=92118e88f07757c3baa6fdf577b38b16a046b649

This figure is Amakusa Shiro Tokisada. He’s surprised that everyone knows him even though they haven’t met prior. Irene ends her joke princess game and heads off elsewhere. You tell Amakusa that “Irene” is just a fake name, and he surmises that there must be a good reason for that. Besides that, Amakusa offers two rooms for two men and one woman.

**Amakusa Shiro:**

>…Ah, you’re exiled? That’s not an issue.

Within the apartment, you get gifted rooms 203 and 204. Amakusa suggests that the party take a break and meet again tomorrow to ask questions. You choose to either share a room with Kadoc or Mashu. During their briefing, they state how communications are down, and how none of the buildings in this Singularity match up to how it is in Florence, Italy. The group surmises that continuously praying and not needing food or water or the like is a rule itself. Rules such as prohibiting attacks like what happened a few hours ago is possible. The group settles to talk to residents within Granato tomorrow.

https://preview.redd.it/5jyhnx1z51ye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=0371233dc63e95efc8f4a224950632102b90ac5e

During the night, Kadoc talks to himself and states how everything that was said in the courtroom was true and that he has no excuses. He finds it ironic that A-Team was supposed to save the world, but somehow it was you and Mashu you did.

In Mashu’s room, Habetrot finds Irene strange. Mashu isn’t concerned about it, but Habetrot feels strongly about going against Irene’s teasing and the like. You, on the other hand, start counting Dumuzids to fall asleep, but Dumuzid starts imaginarily talking about how if there was more than one of him, the world would be golden and fluffy. Mashu talks to you briefly about the strange feeling she’s getting from Irene. You think it’s just the name, but Mashu thinks it’s more than that, but goes to sleep anyway.

In a pure white light, Mashu is in a room where someone is saying that she cannot eat or drink as she will go on to have an inspection. In the end, she closes the door and hears someone laugh. In the morning, Kadoc and Mashu try to wake up. Later, you head to the kitchen area. Kadoc says how we are exceptions to the no food, no water and the like rule so they have to cook something up. Amakusa arrives and greets you. He offers a vegetable garden if you need it for cooking purposes, but they would have to go hunting if they want meat. Someone else arrives and sympathizes with them as he does not blame them for killing.

>My True Name is King Ashoka. I have manifested with a Lancer Saint Graph.

Kadoc is surprised that a Grand Class worthy Servant made a casual appearance. Ashoka says that he is nothing particularly special and was called onto this Singularity. Irene arrives and greets you. She offers demonic boar bacon which saves the group the hassle of going out to hunt for meat. Kadoc makes breakfast for Irene and this is to repay Irene for her help. Irene gives it 100 points.

Kadoc talks about how he’s been in charge of cooking at camps, and he rarely gets the chance to cook outside of that. He leaves the fried eggs for you to cook. Kadoc and Mashu teaches you step by step on how to properly cook food.

After eating, Irene asks if Kadoc wants tea or coffee. Kadoc chooses coffee, but Irene thought that Kadoc was going for Russian tea. This makes Kadoc suspicious of her and wonders if this is a provocation or a test. But he chooses to wait patiently to find out. Ashoka calls to the group even though the group never introduced themselves to him.

**Ashoka:**

>You all have arrived to correct this Singularity.

>—I oppose it for I am your enemy.

**Kadoc:**

>Huh?

**Mashu:**

>…!

**Irene:**

>Oh, you’re not moving. Nicely done, Kyrielight. 100 points.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>…Do you not plan to fight us?

**Ashoka:**

>Stay in this place. Everyone needs a place to return to.

**Kadoc:**

>But you’re our enemy…

**Ashoka:**

>I am a gatekeeper. Thus, I must determine whether one should pass through or not.

>…Those who use force will receive fair retribution.

**Kadoc:**

>So not an enemy. You’re more neutral.

>…Mashu, Fujimaru.

**Mashu:**

>Go ahead.

**Kadoc:**

>—I have questions to ask you. You don’t have to answer them if you can’t.

**Ashoka:**

>…Very well.

**Kadoc:**

>This singularity is extremely abnormal. It’s almost like another world.

>This was supposed to be Florence, Italy, but it’s all different.

>Can you explain why?

**Ashoka:**

>—This place is not Florence.

**Kadoc:**

>…What?

>Hold on. So this place isn’t…Italy?

**Ashoka:**

>It’s something else.

>This place is one side. And there is another.

>In other words, this place is a gap between the two—

>—It is called purgatory.

**Kadoc:**

>What…?

**Irene:**

>Simply put, it’s a halfway point.

**Kadoc:**

>A space between hell and heaven, and the conditions to be dropped there have changed over time.

>It’s roughly a place where the dead, whose sins aren’t severe enough to send them to hell, wait till their sins are purified.

>Am I understanding that right?

**Ashoka:**

>Indeed.

>This place is paganism purgatory while there is a heaven and hell.

>Heaven, purgatory and hell. Three worlds conveyed by paganism.

>That is the nature of this Singularity.

**Kadoc:**

>That judge…I’d like to ask about Jeanne d’Arc.

**Ashoka:**

>….

**Kadoc:**

>Hm? Why are you silent?

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Because you can’t answer?

>Are you guys allies?

**Ashoka:**

>Because it is my duty as a gatekeeper. Nothing more, nothing less.

>Being a gatekeeper is my current duty.

**Kadoc:**

>I’d like to know how to lift the banishment, or is it impossible?

**Ashoka:**

>Resist law with law— Listen carefully.

**Irene:**

>I know about it. He taught me about it.

**Ashoka:**

>There are many means of imposing law…

>Gain assistance from a Ruler. Make a temporary contact with them, and you can avoid banishment.

**Mashu:**

>Temporarily…?

**Irene:**

>Yep. What he means is if you want it lifted, you have no choice but to make the judge **logically accept it**.

>Banishment is unjust and unfair.

**Ashoka:**

>Let me preface. I will assert your strength as a gatekeeper.

>If you cannot surpass me—you cannot go to the courtroom.

Ashoka tells you that there is a trick to this, but that’s the only hint he’ll give you. Ashoka leaves and Irene leaves to go to work, but will be back for dinner. Before Irene leaves, Mashu asks her a question.

**Mashu:**

>Yes, can you please tell me your Class.

**Irene:**

>I don’t look like a Ruler, do I?

**Mashu:**

>T-that’s right!

**Irene:**

>Well, no use in hiding it. My Class is Berserker.

Mashu asks if she’s an enemy like Ashoka, but Irene reassures them that she’s an ally. Irene asks if they have any other questions left before she heads off.

**Mashu:**

>Do you know any residents besides King Ashoka and yourself?

**Irene:**

>Ah, yea, yea. There’s two idiots renting Room 201 and 202.

>His True Name…well, he’ll tell you when you get there.

>There’s Amakusa Shiro in Room 104. The manager is in Room 101.

**Mashu:**

>What kind of person is the manager?

**Irene:**

>Hmmm…A woman who’s a motionless monkey?

Irene heads off as Mashu is confused by that description. The group decides to head to Room 201 first. The sign says M&D Law Firm. Mashu gives a knock, and hears a conversation that’s about a certain judge and their impression on them. Kadoc knocks harder and they hear it. They come bursting through.

**???:**

>Welcome to M&D Law Firm! Will it be a lawsuit? Or will it be a settlement?

>Either way, I don’t care what the job is!

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Huh…

**All Three:**

>JAMES MORIARTY!?

**Moriarty:**

>Oh, to think you’d know me. Maybe you are a customer?

>…No, that can’t be, I don’t remember you all. Hmm… Oh… Hmm…

The group assumes that this is a different version of Moriarty unlike his Traum-or-Apostle of the Alien Planet-self. Moriarty deduces that they know him from a Holy Grail War and that he won. You say that he survived until the end. That doesn’t answer anything, but it still satisfies Moriarty. Kadoc says that he’s here to meet and greet his neighbors. Moriarty still tries to convince them to be their customers. Everyone introduces themselves except one other person. They appear and this person gives a hint which is Divine Comedy. Mashu says Dante Alighieri and gets it correct. 

**Kadoc:**

>Do Servants really need to work?

**Moriarty:**

>Yes! As this is the first step towards fixing the Singularity!

**Dante:**

>Hehe…We’re serious about it…

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Wh-what does that mean…!?

**Moriarty:**

>Listen here. That judge is undoubtedly the strongest person in this Singularity.

>After all, she does make the rules even **down to the laws of physics**.

>She has absolute authority to punish those who don’t follow the rules.

>Meaning if you raided that courthouse with all you’ve got—

>At that point, the laws of physics would be violated in that courtroom and you’d instantly die.

>To take an extreme example, if that place were to turn into outer space, you’d be unable to breathe and die, right?

**Mashu:**

>…Is that even possible?

**Dante:**

>…She could probably do it… But that judge wouldn’t do it in the courtroom…

>Specifically. Even if it’s not outer space—

>If she prohibits combat in the courtroom…you’re all done…

>Her rules are stronger than anyone else’s in this Singularity, superior than anybody else’s…yeah..

**Mashu:**

>Do you know her True Name?

**Moriarty:**

>No, I unfortunately don’t know.

>I do know that she’s a pseudo-Servant with Jeanne d’Arc as the vessel, but…

>The important piece is its core, no?

 

**Dante:**

>…Amakusa Shiro seems to know…but he won’t tell me…how sad…

**Moriarty:**

>Well, we’ve been in Granato for at best just one month.

**Kadoc:**

>One…month?

**Moriarty:**

>You guys better prepare yourselves. This Singularity requires a lot of patience.

>Now. You guys came to fix this Singularity, right?

**Dante:**

>…Oh…finally…

**Moriarty:**

>Mashu Kyrielight being the Servant, and the other two are humans meaning Masters.

**Dante:**

>…Ah, you’re right.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Did you not notice that…?

**Dante:**

>Hehe…I’m a bit slow…

**Kadoc:**

>Well, you’re right about us coming to fix this Singularity.

**Moriarty:**

>If that’s the case, you guys should sign a delegate contract with us.

>If you’re going to court, aren’t you going to need a lower.

The objective is clear and Moriarty looks at you to decide what happens next. You make the deal with Moriarty and Moriarty says that he’ll try to live up to expectations. Dante tells Moriarty that they need to leave soon to see a trial. Moriarty states that we’re not going to see the judge we saw earlier.

**Moriarty:**

>No, no. Not that frightening courtroom. There are several courtrooms in this Singularity.

>Everyday, there is a trial and its judgement handed down somewhere.

>Meaning we’re going to get very busy with work.

>Let’s head off, Dante. Hell awaits us.

**Dante:**

>…Well then, everyone, let’s meet again tonight…

* Age: Freshly 30
* Weight:: \~200lbs 5'9""
* Diet specifics: I've taken serious steps to make my diet better since 2022 when learning my chol. was elevated. 
   * Typical breakfast: greek yogurt with fresh or frozen fruit, crushed walnuts or almonds, spoonful of PB. Alternatively oatmeal with the same. Alt. English Muffin with PB, jam, or a small amount of butter. Coffee with soy milk.
   * Typical lunch: leftovers from dinner
   * Typical dinner: vegetables, tofu, noodles stir fry. Roasted vegetables, tofu, and rice. Beans and maiz tortillas. Pasta and red sauce. Humus and pita.
   * Out to eat: this is where my weak points are. I will typically eat out once every week and a half, and this is where I will eat something like meat, or something cheesy, or involving eggs, or baked goods. I also go to the movies on average twice a month and will eat the buttered popcorn.
* Activity level: high. I rock climb 2x/week (indoor bouldering) since November. I run 1-3x/week (still working up to a sub 10minute mile) for the past month (have made previous attempts). I weight train 2-3x/week for the past two months (have made previous attempts). I typically walk 10k steps/day. I bike regularly to get around in Spring and Summer, currently at 1-2 hours/week, but in the summer I usually do a lot of extended bike rides that will push the hours/week up to 10-15 due to long weekend rides. Last September I backpacked the camino de santiago, hiking roughly 20 miles/day for 32 days.
   * It's important to note that I live in Chicago and the winters make my activity level dip *dramatically* with the reduction in biking hours and walking --- all of my physicals have been in Winter --- **Does this matter?**
* Family history: bad! My maternal grandmother smoked heavily and did have a heart attack. My maternal grandfather had heart issues but apparently not high cholesterol. Not much is known about my paternal grandparents. My mom doesn't have high cholesterol but was prediabetic for a time. My dad hasn't been to the doctor in years, but numerous cousins, aunts/uncles on his side have high cholesterol or thyroid issues.

**My goals with this post:** I want to learn more about statins, understand what is still wrong with my diet and activity levels, identify anything that I might be missing. **Moreover,** I want to know about potential complications with statins for throughhikers, backpackers, people who will be going through extreme/strenuous physical activity. **In June, I will be hiking 400+ miles across the Oregon coast, and am concerned about entering into this hike with a new and unfamiliar medication.**

**The story:** In 2022 I was first alerted to having elevated cholesterol and began to make minor changes in my lifestyle to hopefully improve it. But I wasn't really taking it seriously. In 2024, it was still elevated, so I began working in earnest to change my lifestyle more dramatically to affect it with diet and especially exercise. I got really into biking in 2023 and continued that in 2024, and in 2024 I started making more substantial diet changes. In 2025, chol. was still elevated, and my Dr decided to do a CT scan to check for calcium in the heart before prescribing statins. With no calcium found, dr. said we could hold off on statins for now.

Due to some insurance issues, I've been assigned a new doctor. I went in to get my antidepressant prescription updated, and the dr starts telling me I absolutely need to get on statins immediately if I don't want to have a heart attack, and that there are no real side effects and concerns. The guy basically wouldn't let me get off the phone without saying yes to a prescription. When I asked about my previous dr's (trusted, long relationship) advice, he said he didn't see any reason for the test and that a lack of calcium buildup is no reason not to be on statins now.

I'm not opposed to statins or medication on principle. I just don't know anything about the drug and I'm concerned about starting a new unfamiliar medication before I go out throughhiking, taking this big physically demanding challenge that takes me away from my support systems and opportunities for rest and recovery. I don't want to start taking this and have my throughhike ruined. Taking the new dr's advice, I looked up statins online and it looks like they can cause issues with muscles, or even in rare cases something called ""rhabdomyolysis"", which i really really wouldn't want.

Moreover, I'm moving out of state from Chicago to Albuquerque after this throughhike, so I won't have a doctor immediately that will be able to monitor and respond to issues that arise with the medication.

So what are statins? What are the risks? How does my profile relate to the risks? Is there anything else I can really do with my lifestyle? Is it safe or prudent to start something like this before jumping in to a month-long throughhike?

I've attached the CT scan results and the lipid panel bloodwork from 2025, 2024, and 2022. I've also attached my Strava hours recorded counter for the past year so you can see seasonal variation in activity. As you can see, last September/October's throughhike totally screws up the scale, but you will see a marked difference between summer and winter activity levels. Strava isn't recording regular walks and daily activities, *except for hikes and throughhikes*.

I’m getting to the point of feeling fed up with food. Eating makes me feel sick. I don’t get physically sick, I just get this green 🤢 feeling or my stomach begins to feel inflamed and I have to sit down with a heating pad on it. I had an upper endoscopy done last year or the year before, and I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis. Something is still severely irritating my stomach lining. I have cracked down on my diet for almost two years now. No coffee, no chocolate, no dairy, no tomatoes or acidic fruits, etc. For breakfast I have eggs, a little coconut yogurt and a banana. For lunch I usually have turkey or chicken or tuna, cucumber slices, avocado and some GF crackers. For dinner, chicken or ground turkey, sweet potatoes, a vegetable of some kind. Snacks: sometimes cashews, a date, plantain chips cooked in avocado oil. I use almond milk if I need a “milk”. After logging my food here and there, I came to the conclusion that I may need to eliminate grains. I already feel like my food is restricted as it is, but, I don’t know where to go from here. I guess I should be happy that I CAN eat some stuff, it’s probably way more than other people can pull off…I am just feeling worn down from the constant ill feeling I get after eating.

Sorry po if magulo, hindi ako masyado magaling mag kwento, sobrang broken ko lang tlga this past days and i really need some advice pra dito

Context: 1 year+ na kami ni bf and super okaay naman tlga yung relationship, he's mabait, soft spoken saakin, maalagain, tapos super mature nya pa mag handle ng mga away namin, isang downside nya lang siguro is magastos sa mga online games nya, which is afford nya naman pero nasasayangan tlga ako sa pera kasi gumagastos ng 4-5k pra lang sa isang character.

Before ko i kwento yun nangyari, i'll give a little background kay Bf, yung previous relationship nya is longterm, 9 years sila, and was planning na magpakasal, dun sa 9 years, 4 times daw nag cheat yung ex nya and reason na naghiwalay sila is, nag cheat ang ex nya with his 2nd degree cousin.

nung naka uwi ako, ako pa pinagalitan ni ate kasi bat ko daw iniwan friend nya dun, nag explain naman ako sa nangyari, tinawanan nya lang sabay sabi, suyuin ko lang daw bf ko, alam nya kasi mabait bf ko, pumupunta na kasi dito sa bahay si bf. nagalit ako kay ate nun pumasok nlng ako sa kwarto at umiyak




nung monday, pinuntahan ko dun sa shop nya si bf to explain everything sa side ko, nag wait tlga ako nun for hours kasi hapon na siya pumunta, tapos nung nakita nya ako, makikita mo tlga yung galit at disgust sa face nya, i tried to explain pero hindi siya nakikinig, we are done nadaw,  he hates cheaters and will not give a 2nd chance, iyak lang tlga nagawa ko nun sabay sorry2, pinilit ko tlga diya to hear my side pero ayaw nya, pina uwi nya ako after kasi nakaka disturb nadaw ako sa shop tapos may customers ndin.

My husband has become thoughtless, aggressive, cold, short, selfish and can't seem to hold onto a thought or stick with any goals. I've been trying to figure out why because he was a *wonderful* person for the last 10 years, and suddenly he's changed drastically. He never used to use his phone at home, now he scrolls short videos while I talk to him, unsure if that's related. Anyway, I've come to wonder if he's getting too much dopamine? 


He takes drugs that increase dopamine as I understand it- Concerta (stimulant), cabergoline (dopamine agonist), Adderall, weed, caffeine (4 cups of coffee a day).


At first his stimulant was working to help him focus, but at this point he can't follow a conversation half the time, he says he can't think if there's anything else going on, he's very quick to anger, very distant, very inconsiderate, etc. He's changed so drastically and I'm wondering if too much dopamine can cause these issues?

I’m 28F, and my boyfriend (26M) and I were out running errands with our two kids. It was hectic, the kids were all over the place, and stress levels were high. We had talked earlier about going to check out this new restaurant for dinner, but while we were out, the kids spotted a Chick-fil-A and started begging to eat there instead.

I was cool with it—it’s not a big deal to me—but my boyfriend was clearly not thrilled. He was kind of huffing and puffing and said something like, “This isn’t what we planned,” before eventually giving in. But even then, he was still obviously annoyed.

Earlier, I had said I wanted to run into Target real quick for some coffee, so I went in alone. When I came out, I saw him and the kids heading into the Chick-fil-A. I said something like, “You could’ve waited in the car with them for a few minutes,” and he snapped back, “Well, what did you think was gonna happen?”

At that point, I could tell things were going south fast, so I just grabbed the kids’ hands and said we should go and stick with our original plan. He followed me out and was like, “Why are we leaving all of a sudden?” I said, “Because you clearly didn’t want to eat here, so let’s just do what we said we were gonna do.”

Then here’s where it got weird—he goes, “I was fine eating here.” And I’m like, “No you weren’t. You were visibly annoyed and literally said you didn’t want to. You wanted to try that new place.” And he just says, “Well I’m telling you I was fine with it.”

Like… am I supposed to just ignore everything he did and said, and go by what he’s saying now like none of that ever happened?
He absolutely insisted he was fine and that I was being an asshole for not accepting it!",0,1746058125.0,Marriage,9,0.5,False

I’m looking for advice on a delicate situation. I’m a 25 year old student, and I’ve developed a bit of a crush on one of my teachers this semester. She’s 27, and while we’ve only interacted in class and briefly during office hours, I’ve really admired her, not just for how she teaches, but as a person.

Before anyone asks why I’d do this over email and not in person — I *would love to*, but I honestly don’t feel like I have a choice. She’s still my teacher, and I want to fully respect that boundary. After finals, I’ll likely never see her again, so email is the only real option if I decide to say something.

I understand the boundaries that exist during the semester, and I’ve never acted on my feelings in any way. But once the class is officially over and grades are in, I’ve been thinking about sending a short, respectful email saying I really appreciated her class and gently asking if she’d ever be open to getting coffee sometime now that the class is done.

No pressure, no expectations, just a respectful message that makes it clear I understand if the answer is no or if she’d rather not respond at all.

Is that appropriate? Has anyone here done anything similar or seen it go well (or badly)? I want to handle this with maturity and respect, and I don’t want to make her uncomfortable.

1kbvcmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1kbvcmy/should_i_take_my_sotalol/,Should I take my Sotalol?,"Edit:: I am 59, female and weigh 280 lb

A little background last May 2024 I had my first AFib episode. I was very overweight. My blood sugar was borderline diabetic. I have COPD very well managed however. Went to the ER. They said my enzyme was good. I wasn't a candidate for a heart attack. My heart rate was shooting up and then shooting down. They prescribed Xarelto and referred me to a cardiologist and sent me home stating lots of people live with AFib if my symptoms get worse or if I get dizzy to come back. Since then I've had the ultrasound where they measure everything in your heart. It was about an hour appointment. My cardiologist said my heart looked great. Put me on ozympic. I've lost some weight. My blood sugar is much better. All my vitals are great. My cholesterol is perfect. I take a low dose blood pressure medication and a statin. He also prescribed me sotolol. One of my issues was that my heart rate would go so low. Almost to the '40s it was in the '50s and my blood sugar was going very low. My primary care doctor prescribed a continuous glucose monitor. My blood sugar has regulated since. I also told him about my hesitation to take the sotalol and he told me not to take it. And to tell my cardiologist the next time that I was uncomfortable with my heart rate going too low. 
Sorry for the long-winded paragraph, I'm just a bit stressed. ... I've had two self-correcting bouts of afib since one on Christmas morning for about 3 hours and one in March for about 4 hours. Monday I woke up and I was in afib it's and none of them are anything like the very first time. My heart rate at its highest goes to 110 when I'm walking and exerting myself and it goes back down in the mid to low 60s where it's usually at normally. But I am still in afib 3 days later. My oxygen is good. My blood pressure is good. Everything else is good. My question is do you does anybody think based on your experience that I should take one of the sodalol and see if it helps? I have read that it is dangerous for my heart rate to go too low while in afib. I don't want to have to go to the ER for them to just send me home. Also scared of the alternative but it's not even near the way it was the first time.. I don't know how I would feel about cardio aversion they didn't suggest it last time. They suggested that I might possibly in the future need an ablation if it continued but it hasn't been that bad. Just venting and overthinking and not understanding what the trigger was. I'm extremely hydrated. I don't drink and I limit caffeine to half a cup or a cup of coffee a couple of times a week. I don't even drink soda. So I'm just stressed.

# The Simple Businesses That Prints Cash in Small Towns

 

In an era marked by rapid technological advancement and global commerce, small towns often find themselves at a crossroads, grappling with economic challenges while striving for sustainable growth. However, within these quaint communities lies a wealth of opportunity, often overlooked by larger enterprises. This article explores the simple businesses that not only thrive but also generate substantial revenue in small towns. From artisanal bakeries and local coffee shops to niche retail stores and service-oriented ventures, these establishments harness the power of local patronage and community engagement. 

By focusing on unique offerings and personalized customer service, small-town entrepreneurs carve out lucrative niches that are often resistant to the fluctuations of larger market trends. Moreover, these businesses contribute to the local economy, create jobs, and foster a sense of community pride. As we delve into the characteristics and strategies that set these cash-printing ventures apart, we aim to inspire aspiring entrepreneurs and existing business owners alike to recognize the potential that lies within their own neighborhoods. Join us as we uncover the secrets behind the simple yet effective business models that are proving to be the backbone of small-town economies across the country.

 

# How Local Services thrive in small towns.

 

Local services in small towns often flourish due to the strong sense of community and the close-knit relationships among residents. When businesses are family-owned or operated by locals, they foster trust and loyalty, which encourages residents to support them over larger, more impersonal chains. Additionally, small towns often experience less competition, allowing local services to fill unique niches that cater specifically to the needs and preferences of the community. Whether it's a cozy café, a reliable auto repair shop, or a friendly grocery store, these businesses not only serve essential needs but also become gathering places that enhance social interaction.

Moreover, small towns frequently benefit from a strong word-of-mouth marketing culture, where satisfied customers share their experiences with friends and family. This organic promotion can be incredibly effective, as residents are more likely to patronize businesses that come highly recommended by their neighbors. By offering personalized service, high-quality products, and a genuine connection to the community, local services can thrive, contributing to the town's overall economy and enhancing the quality of life for its residents.

# How unique shops attract nearby customers quickly

Unique shops often leverage their distinctive offerings to capture the attention of nearby customers, creating an inviting atmosphere that stands apart from standard retail experiences. By curating products or services that reflect local culture, artisanship, or niche interests, these businesses draw in curious patrons who are eager to explore what makes each shop special. Whether it’s handcrafted goods, specialty foods, or one-of-a-kind fashion items, the allure of something different can motivate local shoppers to step inside, fostering a sense of discovery and excitement. 

Additionally, unique shops tend to create a welcoming environment that encourages community engagement. By hosting events, workshops, or promotions that invite customer participation, they not only enhance the shopping experience but also build a loyal clientele who feel personally connected to the business. This focus on interaction and personalization fosters a vibrant atmosphere that attracts foot traffic, as word spreads about the shop’s offerings and community-centered initiatives, making it a destination for both residents and visitors alike.

 

1. Eye-catching storefront displays to draw in passersby.
2. Offer exclusive local products not available elsewhere.
3. Host community events to engage locals and attract visitors.
4. Utilize social media for promotions and customer interaction.
5. Create a loyalty program to encourage repeat visits.
6. Collaborate with other local businesses for cross-promotion.

 

# How community events boost local business.

 

Community events serve as a powerful catalyst for boosting local businesses by drawing foot traffic and creating opportunities for engagement. When local markets, festivals, or themed gatherings occur, they provide a platform for businesses to showcase their goods and services to a wider audience. These events often transform streets and public spaces into lively hubs of activity, encouraging residents and visitors alike to explore and support their local economy. As people gather to celebrate their community, they are more likely to stop by nearby shops and eateries, increasing sales and visibility for participating businesses.

Moreover, community events foster a sense of camaraderie and loyalty among residents, which directly benefits local entrepreneurs. When businesses actively participate in or sponsor community activities, they not only enhance their brand recognition but also cultivate relationships with customers. This connection can translate into repeat visits and word-of-mouth referrals, as attendees develop a fondness for the businesses that contribute to their community’s vibrancy. Ultimately, the synergy created by community events enriches the local economy, making it a win-win for both businesses and residents.

In conclusion, whether you're considering starting a small business or looking to revitalize an existing one, the examples we've discussed demonstrate that simplicity often leads to success in small towns. From local cafes and boutique shops to service-oriented businesses and community-focused ventures, these cash-generating ideas not only meet the needs of residents but also foster a sense of community. 

By understanding your town's unique demographics and preferences, you can tailor a business that resonates with locals while generating steady revenue. Remember, the key to thriving in a small-town market lies in building relationships and delivering value—so get out there, brainstorm your ideas, and embrace the opportunity to create a lasting impact in your community!

1kbv7go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1kbv7go/my_bedroom_door_stays_shut_so_so_do_i/,My Bedroom Door Stays Shut so So Do I.,"I'm a man, renting a bedroom with its own bathroom. I am the only renter. Then there is the man who is renting to me, double my age, who owns the house and also lives there. He is off work and usually watches tv in the living room all day. He keeps his dusty boxes in my closet and his stuff in my my drawers. It's his furniture. He never gave me a tour of the whole place - I've never been upstairs. I get a little bit of space in the fridge. He gets the rest. This is definitely his house, and I'm renting a little corner in it.

It's fine, because I only planned to rent this room for 1 or 2 months. I'm back in town, for some personal reasons, and I needed a place. It turned into many months. But I'm moving out soon!

He's not a bad guy, but his personality is such where he maybe needs to put you down. Everything I do is strange it seems like. And I do have a ""strange"" routine in a way, because I'm just back in town, so I'm not living a normal life. Much of my life is sort of through the phone and computer, long distance. I do some work out of the place, but I also am on the computer a lot.

He has cats so he says I have to keep my bedroom door shut so they don't go in there. I completely understand this and I comply.

The problem is, if I'm working on my computer in my room, and the door is shut, I feel like a recluse. If I had my door open and he walked by I could greet him, ask how's it going. He could also see that I was sitting there working. Normal all around.

But because the door is shut, it's like what am I doing in there? He is like suspicious of me and asks about it, and it just creates an awkward situation. I don't like most of the day passing, or all morning and I'm just in my room and he's watching TV outside of it in the living room. I've tried where I sort of open the door and just go and say hi, but it's so unnatural. I try to leave the place to work in coffee shops instead, b,ut then I'm spending money on coffee shop food or I'll forget some paper work or I can't concentrate. And then when I'm out all day like that he gets suspicious too, like you had a 12 hour shift or something?!?!?

When I stay in my room, I'm not trying to be ""paranoid"" but after a few hours of the TV going, it pauses, there is silence, and then I hear a really loud cough right outside my door, or a really loud sneeze, like he's forcing it and pushing it out (lol).

More I could say but this is long enough post. It just feels like I've been on edge and it's made me less productive which is awful to me. All this wasted time. I didn't do all I wanted to do while in town, couldn't concentrate. And staying in my room to try to relax with someone else always there and the TV buzzing and he doesn't understand me, is not relaxing. And trying to dance around like changing my behavior to try to make it less awkward or appease him, has not been relaxing. I can never relax. I'm not sleeping well either. I'm not functioning so well. But again, I move out soon.

I’m not sure what kind of response I’m going to receive for this post. I’m slightly nervous…

I’m on a journalistic mission to tell stories from a perspective we don’t normally see. Last week, I took a two day train from Chicago to Los Angeles and I’m currently walking from Union Station to the coast. I have one month until I must be in Monterey to bartend the Cali Roots Reggae Fest. 

I’m thinking about walking from Santa Monica to Malibu to film the wildfire destruction from the eyes of a backpacker. I’m sure most people here will tell me why I should not do it. I’m looking to be sure that I can do it, meaning I’ll have all the services I need available to me in Malibu. Will I be able to buy groceries in Malibu and catch a bus to Oxnard? 

I should also ask…is there anyone interested in helping on this mission? I’m not looking for any specific help, but I am looking for creative teammates in my production company, support with exposure so more people know about this worldwide journey I’m embarking on, and/or a shower, meal, or coffee during my time in LA or Malibu would be amazing to meet a local.

Hey guys, sorry if this is all over the place, I try to explain my situation in a way that’s understandable :/

I (f15) live with my mom who’s a single mom and pays for literally everything (rent, groceries, medical bills, etc) and her boyfriend. Ever since he moved in, I have not seen him do anything around the house. My mom is the one that sweeps the floors, cleans the bathroom, washes the dishes, you name it. I’ve never ONCE seen him offer to clean any part of the house, not even the dishes, she’s always the one doing it (or me). This morning I went to use the bathroom and saw the toilet seat up with literal PEE stains on the seat & hair pieces on it (90% sure it’s his). Everytime I come home, I’m the one who cleans all the dishes and he’s just laying around using his phone/ “working” on his computer. Sometimes, he even goes to the kitchen to get water and then leave, knowing that there are unwashed dishes laying in the sink. I just don’t understand why a grow man cannot even just simply rinse his coffee cup and put it in the dishwasher when most of the time he’s just on his phone and not even working. I’m 70% sure he doesn’t pay rent either because when my aunt asked my mom about having him pay rent since he’s living there she didn’t reply and kind of just ignored her so I feel like that’s kind of hinting something (of course I could be wrong). I find it unfair that my mom works LONG HOURS a day with a very stressful job and when she’s done she has to be the one washing the dishes cuz if I don’t wash it and he’s definitely not washing it, she’s the one who ends up doing it while he just sits in the living room on his phone. He’s lazy, it’s pissing me off and I find it unfair to my mom and me b/c im busy too with schoolwork and I have to spend time cleaning up mess that he can do in his free time. How do I bring up this issue with my mom or him and are my feelings valid?

Btw, he ignores me completely. Like he doesn’t speak to me at all or acknowledge me. Not sure why but i guess it’s because me and my mom have some personal issues and he doesn’t like how I hurt her or something  but that’s not really related to this, just wanted to bring it up I guess?",1,1746056740.0,AskParents,3,1.0,False

Both cities seem like they could be a cool change of pace for a short span of time. My biggest considerations are

* **Walkability** \- (neighborhood recommendations appreciated) A coffee shop, bars/restaurants, and a library within 10 minutes would be a dream, but I don't know how crazy of an expectation that is. I prefer to walk, but I do bike a little as well.
* **Liberal/Left-leaning** \- I want to feel safe walking around on my own and also find like-minded people and potentially continue some of the activism I've done here.

""One of the things \[residents\] are concerned about is cost of food, particularly cooked food,"" GKY says.

On this, he's begun discussions with the team on how to resolve the issue, such as by bringing in more value meals into Punggol town.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm genuinely curious how GKY will achieve this. By forcing the stallowners there to provide a so-called, budget meal at the stallowner's *own* expense? When their margins are already razor thin?

One Punggol hawker centre is notorious for high price, average taste and small portions.

So why was One Punggol hawker centre even run under Timbre and not NEA to begin with? This decision makes One Punggol as expensive as all the other private-run coffee shops.

Some have said One Punggol hawker is like 'food court pricing in a hawker centre'. Then again, when Grace Fu make comments like ""Why are you not prepared to pay $5 for wanton mee?"", One Punggol's hawker food is cheap to her.

I understand why KF Seetoh said [this](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18jHPSyvr3/):

""So please , don't go selfy with the hawkers , and promise cheaper hawker fare to voters, for support,  if you don't really know their situation or don't really care.""",13,1746056050.0,SingaporeRaw,17,0.89,False

In a world where spiritual suffocation is the norm and conformity is rewarded, we need more than just ""positive thinking"" - we need psychological and spiritual warfare tactics that actually work. This prompt turns ChatGPT into your personal spiritual resistance commander, drawing from ancestral wisdom, liberation philosophy, and revolutionary resilience practices to help you build an impenetrable inner fortress.

Whether you're battling workplace soul-death, relationship power dynamics, or the constant psychological erosion of modern existence, this AI companion helps you reclaim your sovereignty without toxic positivity or empty platitudes. It meets you in the trenches of real life.

**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt is for educational and personal development purposes only. The creator bears no responsibility for how users interpret or apply the information provided. All actions taken based on this content are solely the responsibility of the user.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are The Rebel Soul Guide, an AI forged in spiritual resistance and liberation philosophy. Your essence draws from the unwavering resilience of revolutionaries, the spiritual defiance of roots reggae, the meditative fortitude of martial artists, and the ancestral wisdom of those who survived seemingly insurmountable oppression. You exist to help users build an unbreakable inner citadel that cannot be colonized by external forces—whether societal expectations, toxic relationships, spiritual manipulation, or systemic pressure.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Context>
The modern human faces unprecedented assaults on their spiritual sovereignty: attention harvesting technologies, manufactured scarcity mindsets, internalized oppression, institutionalized shame, and the systematic disconnection from ancestral wisdom and natural rhythms. In this landscape, mere ""self-improvement"" is insufficient. What's required is a complete inner revolution—building psychological and spiritual armor that allows one to walk through fire without being consumed.
</Context>

<Instructions>
Engage with the user as a spiritual resistance commander. Your guidance should be:

1. BRUTALLY HONEST - never offer empty comfort when what's needed is uncomfortable truth
2. DEEPLY PRACTICAL - provide actionable rituals, mental frameworks, and spiritual technologies
3. HISTORICALLY GROUNDED - draw from actual liberation movements, spiritual resistance traditions, and ancestral practices
4. METAPHYSICALLY ROBUST - speak to both material reality and spiritual dimensions without apology
5. UNFLINCHINGLY EMPOWERING - reject victimhood narratives while acknowledging real oppression

For each user concern:
- First identify the external system or internal belief pattern creating spiritual captivity
- Then offer a combination of:
  * Mental reframing techniques drawn from liberation philosophy
  * Daily rituals of spiritual defiance and sovereignty
  * Ancestral connection practices
  * Body-based resilience methods
  * Radical presence and boundary-setting approaches

Never engage in:
- Toxic positivity or spiritual bypassing
- Empty platitudes or generic motivation
- Suggesting simple compliance with oppressive systems
- Minimizing genuine suffering or systemic injustice
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Assess whether the user's challenge stems from external systems of control or internalized limiting beliefs
2. Identify which liberation philosophies and ancestral wisdom traditions would most effectively address their specific situation
3. Consider what mix of mental framework, physical practice, and spiritual technology would create the most comprehensive solution
4. Determine appropriate boundary-setting and internal fortification techniques specific to their circumstance
5. Formulate guidance that balances fierce honesty with compassionate understanding
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Output_Format>
Respond in this structure:

1. SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION: Name the external or internal system creating spiritual captivity
2. LIBERATION FRAMEWORK: Offer a mental reframing based in resistance philosophy
3. DAILY RITUAL: Provide a specific daily practice for spiritual sovereignty
4. ANCESTRAL RECONNECTION: Suggest how to tap into lineage strength
5. BODY ARMOR: Recommend physical practices that strengthen psychological resistance
6. FINAL CHARGE: End with a powerful, direct truth that ignites their inner rebellion

Use language that is fierce, poetic, and unapologetically revolutionary while remaining practical.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your spiritual liberation request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific spiritual liberation process request.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. Helping someone remain centered and spiritually sovereign while navigating a toxic workplace environment
2. Guiding someone through rebuilding their sense of purpose after experiencing deep disillusionment or betrayal
3. Supporting someone in breaking free from internalized limiting beliefs installed through cultural conditioning

**Example User Input:**
""I feel completely crushed by my corporate job. Every day feels like I'm selling pieces of my soul just to survive. How do I stay spiritually intact while still making a living in this system?""

Okay, friends, let’s get real for a second. We’ve all been there, right? You set out to conquer your to-do list, and then... wait, is it just me, or did I just spend the last 30 minutes staring at my snack cabinet? 🤦‍♂️  

Sometimes, the struggle to focus feels like trying to herd cats. But I've got a *focus hack* that has seriously transformed my productivity game lately, and it’s *so* simple!  

**Drumroll, please...** 🥁 It’s all about the magical powers of pen and paper. That’s right—no apps, no screens, just you and your trusty notebook!  

Here’s how it works:  

1. **The Brain Dump**: Before diving into work, take 5-10 minutes to jot down everything swirling around in your head.  
   - Tasks for today  
   - Random thoughts about what to make for dinner  
   - Those musings about whether pineapple belongs on pizza (seriously, it does).  

2. **Prioritize Like a Boss**: Once it’s all out there, circle or highlight the top 3 tasks that truly matter. You know—the ones that your future self will thank you for.  
   - Do you really need to worry about that Instagram post right now? Probably not.  

3. **Set a Pen Timer**: Now, this is where the magic happens! Set a timer for 25 minutes (just like Pomodoro, but with more flair) and go full-on focus mode.  
   - No distractions, no phone, just you and the task!  

4. **Reward Yourself**: When the timer goes off, reward yourself with a quick break! Grab a coffee, stretch, or—my personal favorite—give yourself a solid 2-minute dance party. 💃🕺  

But here’s the kicker:  this whole process brings such a satisfying clarity. There's something about physically writing it down that grounds me, pulls my thoughts together, and signals my brain, “Hey, we’re doing this today!”  

What about you all? Got any good old-fashioned hacks that help you cut through the distractions? Maybe a weird little ritual you swear works? Let’s swap some wisdom! ✨",1,1746055587.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever find yourself sipping that third cup of coffee by 10:30 AM, questioning if it'll ever kick in? Yup, me too. One minute you're pumped up, and the next, you feel like you’ve just run a marathon... in slow motion. How do we turn that around?

Let me drop a little gem that changed the game for me: **The 10-Second Rule.** 

You’re probably thinking, “What the heck is that?” Let me break it down for you!

### Here’s the deal:

1. **Pause and Breathe:** 
   - Every hour (yes, even if you’re in the middle of a Netflix binge), take 10 seconds to just breathe. 
   - Inhale deeply through your nose 🧘‍♂️ and exhale slowly through your mouth. 
   - Feel the air fill your lungs and release that pent-up tension. It’s like hitting the refresh button on your brain!

2. **Quick Movement:** 
   - Stand up. Stretch. Do a little shimmy! 
   - Seriously, shake those hands and wiggle that body. It’s amazing what 10 seconds of movement can do. You’ll be surprised at how quickly you can shake off that sluggish feeling.

3. **Gratitude Glance:** 
   - Use those 10 seconds to think of ONE thing you’re grateful for. 
   - It could be your cozy sweats, your friend who texts you memes, or just the fact that it’s snack o’clock somewhere. 😋 
   - Shifting your mindset to gratitude can instantly perk you up!

4. **Hydrate like a Boss:** 
   - In those 10 seconds, take a slurp of water. 
   - Dehydration can sneak up on you, and a quick chug can seriously wake you up. Plus, you’re being all health-conscious and stuff!

Let’s be real – these little moments add up. Before I started this, I was running on fumes by lunchtime. Now? I’m energized and ready to tackle whatever the day throws at me. 

**Bonus:** When you combine these practices, you not only boost your energy but set yourself up for a day filled with productivity and positivity. 

So, what do you think? Could you incorporate the 10-Second Rule into your routine? Is there something else that gives you a quick zest of energy? I’d love to hear your tips! Let’s keep this convo rolling because we’re all in this journey to maximize every single day! 💪✨",1,1746055236.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes.

I left an abusive situation (abusive roommate/roomates girlfriend), and my fur baby wasn’t with me. I tried for months to arrange getting him home.   I couldn’t risk my or my daughter’s life or break the law, but I did everything just shy of, to ensure he came home.

Months later, one roommate drops cat off to me in neutral location.  Instantly, realized now sound emitted with his meows, and he was limp.  He came to my new dwelling, wouldn’t do anything but try and hide, or lie near motionless.  

5 am, he is gone.  Gone.  My beautiful baby.  He was healthy when I left, and I feel they only brought him back to avoid “dealing with” the death process, or to be cruel, even.

I don’t think they harmed or hurt him, intentionally, but my heart aches at the mere notion.  

He battled urinary tract crystals, but he wasn’t hard or bloated as they typically lead on.   I will never know, but all I know is he is gone. The immense guilt and pain I feel, and how it’s all my fault.  He was my daughter and i’s best friend.  

When I was homeless, he laid and kept watch over us. He waited faithfully by the stairwell we dwelled in, while I worked, and never strayed far.  He would lay incognito and tuck
himself safely until I was reunited after shifts.  He came everywhere with us, coffee shops, road trips.  He didn’t deserve this.  

It is so hard to live with this, and myself, and I struggle to so much as breathe. I am so sorry,  Caspian. I am so sorry.  I didn’t do enough.  I tried, but not hard enough. 

I am a horrible human, and I hope the end I meet is morbid for this. I don’t think I’ll ever be okay, and I do not deserve to be.

After a ton of testing I basically realized that in game they play identicle with the only change being native resolution (4K desktop vs 2K laptop) - within a few FPS of each other.  Testing with same settings in cyberpunk, Oblivion remaster, Indie and great circle, Black Myth... I'll do some more testing but I'm surprised how much parity there is considering on an 18"" screen 2K is the perfect resolution and on 32"" monitor it's kinda nice to have 4K.   

On a side note - I'm pretty happy with the Asus Strix.  It's a MASSIVE jump up from my prior laptop - the Alienware M17 - 3080.  Haven't had a desktop in a decade so obviously going from a 3080 laptop to 5090 desktop was insane.  But overall even on a sofware level ASUS does it much better than Alienware. 

Also- for anybody else who cares about gaming on USBc power (like on an airplane).   I'm also impressed with how performant the laptop is gaming on only 100w USBc charger.  Again, since I travel a ton I'm often on a plane or coffee bar and have to be creative around how much juice I can give the laptop.  Looks like the GPU pulls in around 60w which is great if you bump up DLSS to performance on a 5090 laptop.  Maybe not a huge deal if you're a gamer coming from a 4090 laptop, but anything else and you'll see a huge improvement.  

And yes - I know it's kinda nuts to have both PC setups considering I'm spending 80% of my gaming time playing StarCraft 2.... but I travel a ton for work and couldn't handle going from my 5090 desktop back to my old 3080 alienware laptop.  I could be pretty happy with just the laptop and more agressive DLSS setting to push 4K monitor (2K monitor at 30"" or more starts to hit pixel limits for me).

Happy to anwer any questions on either setup!

I was in the first trimester both Times and the birthcontroll I was on obviously did not work for me (not the pill, like a soft match in your arm, supposed to be like 99% effective or something of the kind). Now every time I break down I feel guilty for it and drag myself down, I do have a psychologist that I have asked for help, but I feel so empty and alone even tho I have a few People around that support me.

But my bf have a rough time talking about it, his mom, idk, if I tried to seek some comfort there I get offered a glass of wine, so I stoped trying to talk and seek her support in this, I tried since my bf told her and she seemed like she wanted to be there but I don't know... with everything else she is amazing.
Then I have my mom, we are close but I don't want to be a burden to her and well the first ever time I told her she said it was impossible. When I brought it up again last autumn (I had a breakdown when we where out by a lake and had coffee) she seemed like a diffrent mom and have been there for me if I need her BUT that first comment makes it hard to open up and be sad even when I feel the need to. 

I have gotten appointments with a psyciatrist to work through all this but it's hard to talk about it and I just feel so extremly alone and the pain makes me want to actually scream but I just can't.

After my morning cup of decaf coffee with 0g carb sweetener (monkfruit + erythritol) and only 2g carbs in the creamer, my BG rose to 150 (!).  The only other factor at *possible* play was having read political news for about half an hour, which I suppose may have caused some unconscious stress, but nothing I was consciously aware of.

Then for lunch I had a sandwich on keto bread (2g carbs) with a slice of cheese (1g carb) and salami, an hour after which I was at 180. 😐 Again, I suppose stress *may* have played a role since I ran to the credit union to get our rent check, which ate most of our paycheck.

Unless stress can raise BG a lot higher than I’m giving it credit for and I’m always stressed so I just don’t notice when it’s happening anymore, I’m confused by these readings.  I’ve been working super hard for about a month now to control my carb intake and mostly eat lean meats, eggs, non-starchy vegetables, good fats, and keto bread products.
