One of my favorite places is Telway - it was there when I needed the cheapest food, and it's still there with strong sweet double double coffee and a bag of sliders that tastes just as good the next day. I can go back and get that hit of nostalgia any day.

**CHAPTER 3: Past Mistakes**



The morning of the 29th of October Mymy Schoppenboer woke up feeling amazing, she had taken careful steps the previous week planning her escapade with Kiki. She picked up her phone and was about to text Kiki to get ready to make history (in both senses). But then seeing their last conversation from last night made her smile fade… Right, she told her the plans are cancelled, and Kiki was mad at her for this. Mymy recalled the events of yesterday, the shock of her sisters physically assaulting each other, Coco cursing and yelling at her, and the discussion her family had last night. She really wanted this plan to come to fruition, but somehow all her energy got zapped away, she couldn’t explain how or why she felt like this.



She got up, stretched and yawned. She decided it was better to get breakfast, maybe she could indulge in some stroopwafels behind her mom’s back. She opened her door and peeked outside Maya and Coco didn’t appear to have left their rooms although with Maya that was almost always a given, but Coco would already be greeting and hugging her.



“Good morning sweetie.” Mymy was startled by the sudden appearance of her mother at the top of the stairs, who followed with a quick kiss on her forehead.



“Good morning mom.” Mymy replied. “Hey uhm… are Coco and Maya downstairs?” and she tried to follow up.



“Why? Is something wrong?” Soei felt the need to ask, making a worried face made Mymy a little uncomfortable.



“No no, I just… you know… hoped everything was alright” Mymy said while looking to her side.



“Everything’s… fine for now, your sisters are grounded and won’t go to school today.” Soei replied while turning her head towards the doors of the girls. Mymy frowned at this. “You better get ready for school sweetie, I made you pancakes, and please don’t eat any stroopwafel, I already know you took some last night.” 



The news that her sisters were grounded after their fight didn't come as a shock for Mymy, Coco did hit Maya pretty hard, she could only get glimpses of Maya’s face but she saw her right eye was darker than usual and swollen as well as having a small bandage on her nose. The image of Maya bleeding coming back to her head made her shudder, she quickly went downstairs instead of remembering as she still wanted to eat breakfast.



Mymy saw her plate waiting for her, her father was on the opposite side of the plate drinking a cup of coffee. They said good morning to each other, Soei came down shortly after she sat in front of Mymy watching her eat thinking of what else she was missing from her daughters. She then turned to Ravi and gave a small nod. Mymy saw her mother and looked at her with mild worry.



“Mom… what’s wrong?” Mymy questioned.



“Mymy… I need you to tell me something.” Soei replied looking downward with Ravi joining her on the chair next to her. “Has Coco also hit you or threatened you?”



Mymy swallowed her pancakes, caught off guard by the question. 



“Uhm…” She looked at her mother and father, and then to her plate again.



“Has she?” Soei asked out of worry.



“No, no! I mean…” Mymy looked around for the right words in her mind. “She has thrown papers at me or warned me whenever I do something weird or I get us in trouble, but outside of that… no?” 



“And… Do you *feel* threatened by her?” Ravi followed up.



Mymy looked down, thinking, does she? She’s always been cordial and friendly with her, showing her love every time she can, playing games together, spending time together, she can’t say she doesn’t have good memories with Coco. But… there was…



“Mymy?” Soei said.



“Uhm… There *was* this one time that…” Mymy tried to get her words out. “I may have talked about her parents too…”



Soei and Ravi frowned at this.



“Let me explain, ok!” Mymy defended herself. “It was when we were like… 7 I think…”



“We were making snowmen in the winter, everything was great, while you two were helping Maya with something Coco and I were alone, so to make conversation I asked if it snowed in South Africa.” Mymy recalled.  “Coco said it wasn’t common, she never got to experience it with her parents. She had a very sad expression when she said it, but… I didn't pick up on it and asked why…” Mymy cringed at the next part.  “Coco then told me that her family didn't get the opportunity for that. And I *still* didn’t pick up on it. **so**, I said…”



*“Huh, well… You're lucky you're living with us now, you can enjoy all this snow now.”* Mymy slowed her speech down with each word as her parents' expressions changed. “And well… Coco got mad and she pushed me and destroyed our snowman and went back to you and Maya…” Mymy looked down at her feet. “Yeeeeeep…”



“I mean… I don’t blame Coco. This was before you told me about her parents.” Mymy continued. “She apologized for that incident and gave me a hug and stroopwafels.”



Soei and Ravi looked at each other, shocked that this pattern of sensitivity that Coco has with her biological family had existed for so long, they barely talked about it with her, feeling it unnecessary and seeing as Coco was happy made them not worry.



“And what about Maya?” Ravi asked. 



“Well, you know… she’s Maya.” Mymy replied while fidgeting with her hands. “We are fine with each other…” Mymy saw her parents weren’t fully convinced by this statement. “Ask her if you don’t believe me.”



“So uhm… I think I’ll go get ready for school now…” Mymy said as she got out of her seat and went to the bathroom, looking back at her parents until she closed the door.



“Ravi…” Soei said. “Why didn’t we know any of this? Why didn’t we notice this?”



Ravi had a defeated look. “I don’t know… Maybe we just weren’t paying enough attention…”



Ravi then looked at his watch, he sighed because he was running late… but he didn’t want to leave his wife at that moment, but knew he had to. “I’m sorry my love, but I need to go, call me when you get to the huisarts, or if anything else happens alright?” 



Soei nodded, after a goodbye kiss Ravi went out the door, he had to take a train this time as Soei needed the car for today. She sighed, ran her hands through her face and took a deep breath, she then picked up Mymy’s plate and went to the kitchen.



Unknown to all three of them, Coco was sitting with her back against the handrails of the stairs. She had heard the entire conversation, she felt guilt and was about to cry again. If not for Maya suddenly opening her door the sisters then locked eyes and frowned at each other, Maya closed her door. Coco got up, shook her head and headed downstairs.



“Good morning, mom” Coco said while not looking at her mother’s direction. Soei turned and gave her daughter a warm smile.



“Good morning, sweetheart,” Soei replied. “I made pancakes.”



“Thank you…” Coco still looked dejected.



“Has Maya gotten up yet?” Soei dared to ask, looking at Coco.



“I don’t know…” Coco made a small frown when hearing Maya’s name.



“Then I’ll go wake her up.” Soei sighed, picked up some pancakes on a plate and went upstairs.



Coco started eating her breakfast, but stopped once she saw Mymy get out of the bathroom, already dressed and ready for school. The sisters looked at each other and didn’t say anything, Mymy broke the ice by waving half heartedly and smiling at her sister, Coco reciprocated.



Mymy went upstairs to get her backpack and say goodbye to her mother.



Coco then recalled Mymy’s conversation with their parents, does Mymy actually feel threatened by her? But she’s done everything right, the snowman incident was just a one-time thing, and she apologized for that too! And her parents' questioning made her feel worse, do they think she’s some kind of bully?

Coco was too preoccupied with her thoughts that she never noticed Mymy leaving the house.



Upstairs, Soei knocked on Maya’s door and after not getting a response she opened the door, Maya hid her phone as soon as she heard her mother.



“Maya.” Soei said softly. “Good morning.”



“Hi…” Maya let out a weak response.



“I made you breakfast… it’s pancakes” Soei tried to make her daughter comfortable.



Soei put the plate and fork next to Maya and sat beside her daughter. Maya didn’t move for a minute, she looked at her mother, Soei noticed her eye was still swollen.



“Have you put on the ice pack?” Soei asked.



“No…” Maya asked while looking away.



The mother and daughter stayed silent for a while. “Maya…” Soei spoke up. “I need you to tell me something, and be honest with me.” Maya waited for her next words.



“Mymy told me and your dad about… an incident she also had with Coco.” Maya turned to her mother in surprise. “When you were 7 Mymy accidentally insulted her family and made her upset.”



Maya didn’t know how to feel about this information, she again felt validation for her parents finally seeing that Coco had flaws, but she also felt bad because at least Mymy did it without meaning any insult, where does that leave her?



“Have you seen them be aggressive towards each other?” Soei asked her daughter. Maya looked to the side trying to think of another incident. And outside of that incident and Coco trying to stop Mymy’s exploits, they actually seem to love each other. This made Maya angry at them for actually giving a damn when it doesn’t involve her, she then shook her head responding to her mother.



“Alright, that’s good to know.” Soei replied. “And what about you and Mymy? Is there anything I should know about?”



Maya thought for a second, remembering the times Mymy would laugh at her or mock her shortcomings or try to “help” and just make things worse for her. She wondered if she even likes Mymy, she’s loud, childish,  egocentric and… just sad… She never understood her need to dye her hair and wear those silly contact lenses, does she really hate herself that much?



“Maya?” Soei looked worried at her daughter's silence.



“She’s Mymy… at this point you know how it is with her…” Maya’s words didn't put her at ease.



“Alright… eat your breakfast and get ready to go out, we're leaving in 40 minutes.” Soei said after a minute of silence, she then got up and left Maya's room, closing the door behind her.



Maya only ate one pancake before feeling guilt again, and left the rest on her desk. Soei was about to go downstairs but then turned and saw the picture frames of her daughters. She focused on Maya’s seeing her gradually lose her sweet smile. Soei thought to herself that maybe indeed she has not been paying enough attention.

That’s right! You may not realize it but back in 1993 Tim Horton’s coffee was an urban drink and Napanee showed that rural communities could have it too! Belleville got store #13 and Kingston got store #15 but those are big urban centres. It was only when we went to the city that we got our double-double just like on “Royal Canadian Air Farce.” But Napanee showed small communities everywhere that they deserved fancy coffee too.

 Napanee got store #741 which means Tim Hortons built 103 stores before getting to number #844 in Picton. Communities like Bath and Yarker are still waiting on their Tim’s and Wellington, despite being full of fancy city people, only gets a Tim’s attached to a gas station. You’re welcome, Picton! High five!

My first time going to the Napanee Tim Hortons was in 1994 with my boyfriend Dwayne. We were going to go fishing in his boat and wanted to get breakfast. We thought: why not try Tim’s? We got large double-doubles and I got a Boston cream donut and he got an apple fritter. It was delicious and not just because it was Tim’s but because it was our Tim’s. Dwayne had never been through a drive-thru before and he almost got the boat stuck on the speaker. It was a good thing it was light because we could just get out and lift it.

I remember sitting in the front of the boat skimming across the water as the sun came out, drinking that coffee, and feeling so luxurious. I have aged like fine wine but let me tell you that I was beautiful that day. I remember watching Dwayne as he piloted the boat out of the river, his long hair blowing in the wind and his moustache looking very handsome. In those days men wore jean jackets with the arms cut off and it made him look so strong and masculine. He was almost as handsome as Bryan Adams. I just wanted him to cuddle me but I knew he was looking at me too and it was the Tim’s that kept me from wrapping myself in a blanket. I know Dwayne was very happy for that!

It was one of the most romantic dates I have ever been on. We caught three pickerel and Dwayne even caught a giant catfish. It was so scary and I know it was one of God’s creatures but Dwayne protected me anyway with one of his empty beer bottles. Even today his chivalry makes me quiver. Let me tell you that fish is not all Duane caught that day! But I can’t tell you any more or things would get pretty steamy!

I love Tim Hortons. It is so nice that premium coffee chains want to support small towns too. A few years ago another fancy city coffee chain came to town, I think it was called fragrance or something. They’re closed now. I was sad that they closed but that’s what they get for competing with Tim’s. It’s too good and let’s not forget that it’s Canada’s coffee shop! I am so glad that we could lead the way for small places like Madoc and even international locations like Watertown to have great coffee too.

This is probably the most fascinating thing to me of all things Mormonism. No matter how wicked and evil sex and sexuality are made out to be, Mormons are still ilicitly sexing. The amount of youth and young adults we were hearing about going through a repentance process, having to wait to go on a mission, having to get married, or the amount of affairs that happened; is sort of staggering. The same rate, if not more, among the ""Gentiles.""  Even in my wife's own family.  (My wife is 1 of 6 siblings and 4 of the 6 have cheated or been cheated on by their new and ever lasting covenant spouse. We won't even go into extended family - aunts, uncles, counsins, and etc.)  I wonder if that's why things like the Word of Wisdom and Tithing are so heavily fixated on by Mormons. They feel like shitty human beings for having natural sexual urges but hey.........""I've never had coffee and I pay a full tithe. Jesus loves me!!!!"" I recall getting the side eye from a guy at church for drinking Dr. Pepper at a ward Father and Son campout. Turns out, that guy was having an affair with a co-worker....and it wasn't his first. Reminds me of the author of ""Letter For My Wife."" This guy poured his entire heart and soul into this letter so that the love of his life would understand his loss of faith, and she never read it. Because, as it turns out, she was having an affair.

My ex-Mormon BIL told me the story of a Mormon FWB he had and that on one particular day they had wild sex. Then later, she freaked the fuck out on him when he suggested they watch a rated R movie. 🤦

I'm left to wonder if the feelings of being broken and miserable is its own drug. Is Mormonism just one big Stockholm Syndrome? Do Mormons not wanting  to hear the truth about their religion have less to do with attacking their faith and more to do with the trepidation of not knowing how to feel about not having daily/hourly/minutely feelings of guilt and self-loathing? ""I don't need to have a less-rigid life to improve my mental health. It's why I have abstinence from tea, coffee and rated R movies. That makes me feel so good about myself.""

1l4qy1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l4qy1b/i_love_being_confused/,I love being confused,"I love being confused 




I love being confused and its just such a wonderful feeling when you don’t know something properly. Confusion stretches and massages the brain and squeezes all of the depression and anxiety from out of the brain. When I get confused it is an amazing moment and I get a rush of euphoria and joy that no other person could compete with. 

Oh I love confusing people even more and I hate those who lead a life that makes sense or try to make sense out of confusing things. These people are the destroyers of joy and they should be crushed and destroyed with not one atom left of them. I remember a couple of months back I saw my ceiling moving up and down inside the house and I was astounded once more at how this was happening and why I wasn’t crushed. It was incredible and how my ceiling was moving up and down and not changing the whole house was brain teasing. I could feel a good stretch in my brain and a good needed stretch was needed. I then saw a train coming out of my cupboard and the people inside the train were puking on each other. They were puking different colours on each other.
I had no idea what to make of all of this and I was so happy with what I was experiencing and how I couldn’t explain it. I loved this so much and I loved confusion more than my children who starved to death because I over fed them. I don’t know how they could have starved with the amount of food I had given them but then again, I was becoming high at the senselessness of it all. I love confusion more than my wife who I married on the moon without any space suit and I remember the wedding and how impossible it was, all of it. Although there we both were getting married on the actual moon and even my time table for work is confusing where it says my day off is at the same time as my working day, and that’s why I love my job.

My life is perfect because nothing makes sense and I don’t want anything to make sense in my life and I want things to happen without cause or effect. I once shot my gun at my friends head and all of a sudden he didn’t smell of body odour anymore. My friend had always struggled with the way he smelled and people in public would always move seats in public transports, but ever since I shot him in the head he smells amazing now. I love this and my brain is having a party and a wild ride and I don’t want it to stop like ever. I remember getting a taxi and the taxi never moved from its place and when I got out of the taxi, I was now at my destination. I then started to argue with the taxi that because he never actually moved his car I didn’t really owe him money. The taxi driver then started arguing with me at how logical I was being and he was right. I paid him extra and I started to burn my tongue with lava as punishment for making sense and instead of pain, I instead became a great singer for a while.

Then there is Arnold who is always doing things that make sense and I hate Arnold. The worst thing about Arnold is that he brings his logical straight forward world into other peoples lives and it also straightens out their lives for a bit. Everything starts to make sense and logical and the terror of everything making sense is just too torturous for me. I have warned Arnold of ever coming close to me and infecting my life with his life. Arnold tries to speak to me about things that make sense and I try to ignore but as my ears and mind absorb what Arnold is trying to say, everything in my life starts to straighten out. Heating things makes things hotter and cooling things makes things colder. I then punch Arnold and instead of falling he gets transported to a library. Then everything in my life becomes confusing again and I have a sigh of relief about it. Everyday I count the blessings that is confusion and I count them and I praise the confusion that gives me so much joy and laughter. People like Arnold makes things hardened and rough with their logic and sense where everything must go in a certain way and I don’t like that at all. I prefer it when I try to turn left on a road that it becomes right and when I crash into a car, I end up in Barbados. This is the way the world should always be.

As I see Arnold desperately trying to speak with he people inside the library about logic and sense I count the blessing of confusion. I cut down trees by placing a pillow on the tree and I drown by not going into the water. I breath in air by not breathing in air and I run by not running and by realising these things it gives my brain such a great massage. Honestly the brain needs a great massage and I could feel of the juicy tensions dripping away from my brain and it feels oh so marvellous. I burned my daughter with ice cream even though I never had a daughter but every day I hug my daughter even though I never got married, even though I got married on the moon. It’s the guy Arnold again trying to interrupt my counting of blessing that is confusion and as he comes closer to me, his aura starts to effect the world that I love and know. Everything starts to make sense and time seems to flow more correctly and what’s up is up and what’s down is down. Its just so horrible when things make sense and I don’t know who would want to live in a world like this.

I push Arnold and I run away from him by not running away and to fight against Arnolds is by doing something confusing that doesn’t make sense. I count more blessings of all of the confusion that I experience in my day to day life. I shopped around and paid money with it even though I never have money and I am penniless, the world got destroyed today but I am still here and I got a birthday present for someone who will never be born. Yes I felt more better now and especially when that Arnold guy ruins my life for a moment. Who does that Arnold think he is going up to people and straightening out their lives and making their brains feel more stiffer and rigid. Today I also met my worst enemy and I also didn’t meet him and realising that caused an opening in my brain and flooded with so much good feelings and I was in heaven. I said hello to people who weren’t there and I flooded a country with no water. My remote wasn’t working because the batteries had ran out of charge and so I got it working by not replacing it with batteries that do work. I walked on ground that were made of air and I pulled teeth out of people who had no teeth.


I love counting my blessing of confusion and I gave bald people haircuts and freed dogs by getting them more leeches. I knocked on a house by never knocking and I solved a problem even though there was no problem to start off with and I couldn’t stop counting all of the confusing blessings in my life. I was hopping with joy and licking other peoples ice creams and holding hands with people with no hands. Then Arnold was close by and his gathering was growing bigger and I couldn’t believe that his following was increasing. I couldn’t believe that people were listening to Arnold about logic and things making sense and I knew that he will infect those people by making their lives move in a straight line. Arnold you are a destroyer of good things and an asshole to begin with and the things that I want do to you Arnold for ruining peoples lives with idea of logic and things making sense is an abomination. Its not just an abomination but an travesty and you should be hanged Arnold for giving such idea of sense and logic. Nothing should make sense and nothing should ever go with the flow and life should be confusing because a confusing life is just amazing.

I cook food without cooking and eat without eating and I cannot imagine what your life is like Arnold and I couldn’t even be in the same room as you. Saying that I don’t want to be in the same room as you, I made that possible Arnold by being in the same room as you and I knew this confused you when kept on asking me why I was in your house, and when I kept on answering back with “the reason I am in your house is because I don’t want to be in the same place as you or in the same room as you” and this confusion caused you so much mental agony and I was enjoying it. Then I gave you more mental agony by saying how much I hate by loving you and this caused you more confusion but then you started attacking back at me by trying to make sense of things. Arnold when you tried to attack me back by trying to make sense of things I could feel everything going the way it should do in order and in physical sense. I hated it and my brain started to hurt from the depression and sadness and I tried attacking you back with more confusion. 

I started to count my confusions.
I made a cake for myself but a stranger had eaten instead and I shower by not showering, I watch tv with my eyes close, I listen to music by being deaf and I run by not using my legs. I could tell now Arnold was hurt by these things and he begged me to stop but I kept on going and going. I go on the computer by picking up a rock and I saved someone by not saving them and I gave a correct answer to a question by giving the wrong answer. I was winning against my fight against Arnold and I knew the confusion that surrounded me was now affecting Arnold life and then Arnold started to fight back. He started saying out correct math equations and things that made sense in a sentence and this started to hurt me. How dare you Arnold try to fight me back and I had never experience someone ever fighting back by having someone fight me back. I ran out of Arnolds by standing still and I could feel my life making sense. Things moved that had the correct engine and motion and the air was properly breathed in and when I held someone down in water, they had surely drowned. 

Luckily though I was away from Arnold long enough for the confusion to come back into my life. The police arrested me for drowning someone by not arresting me and I got given a life sentence by simply living life as a free man. Arnold was now growing in number and these lived lives that had made sense and were properly aligned. It was disgusting and I couldn’t believe that people would do such a thing and how dare they turn away from confusion. So I didn’t punish them by punishing them and we still had growing numbers of people like me who were still relishing in the wonderful enlightenment of confusion. I love being confused and I loved confusion more than I love my enemy and myself, and I am the enemy. I love saying things that don’t make sense and when my brain tingles when it is confused, what other substance can do such a thing for the brain without any real consequences. I had to count more confused blessings and I drink coffee by drinking orang juice, and I divorced again even though I was never married to begin with and I always move forwards by going backwards.

I don’t understand why people want their lives to make sense and such a logical life will become boring and depressing. I remember when my life made sense and everything felt so empty and I wanted to disappear. The existential crisis you will get from a logical life is unanimous and the constant same motions will go backwards and forwards till you go crazy and faithless. What sort of life is a logical one where the heart hardens and you feel nothing and the brain loses its imagination and wonder. 

Arnold should be decapitated, Arnold should be burned, Arnold should be made an example out of for those who stary against confusion. Arnold thinks he is doing good but he doing the opposite and fights are breaking between people of confusion and people of logic. Those who are of confusion like me keep doing confusing things by not doing confusing things to be confusing and to hurt the people of logic. The people of logic do logical things by picking up litter and putting it into a bin or setting the alarm clock to set off at a certain time so that you could get to a certain place in time. What a horrendous way to live and I will never yield and I will never bend down to the people of logic.

I will always be confused and I will always be doing what ever like by not doing it and sometimes when the confusion gets to a certain amount, the good feeling endorphins start pushing out some of the brain from out of the nose. I got a piece of my brain that came out of my nose but it wasn’t my brain but someone else’s. So someone else’s brain came out of my nose and I then decided to go to America by simply not going on a plane or a boat. Then I remember being surrounded by some of Arnolds and their auras and the things they were saying, it was making sense and my brain was hurting like a lot. I tried to count my confusions and I loved how I went home by not going home, I loved how I cooked hot food inside the fridge and I enjoyed fishing with my best friends that are also fishes. 

My best friends that are fishes would become offended when I catch a fish and don’t let it go and I love it how I got to sleep by not sleeping and waking up by not waking up and I enjoy how I pick my nose but always think its my finger but its actually someone else’s finger, and so I chop it off and give it to them and apologise to them for having their finger on my hand. Arnolds friends were surrounding me and the things they were shouting at me sounded like “something fell to earth and cocked up everything. Everything has gone haywire and you have to got to try and stay logical to beat the confusion. There is something in the air” and it was making sense and so I started killing them by not killing them and burying them in the skies. They were destroying everything that I love and I couldn’t believe that they would do such a thing and destroy a person’s wellbeing. I love being confused and its like when a person grinds their sharp nails against your eyes that’s how great confusion feels. Oh the freedom that confusion gives compared to logic because logic imprisons things to be a certain way. Like that thing should be like that and this thing should go like this, but now confusion has made it where anything is possible.

Arnold was crying at some of his followers that weren’t alive anymore and he looked at me with anger and I looked at him with anger by showing him kindness. I took him to restaurants and shopping and that’s how much I hated him. The confusion sometimes nearly took over him and now and then I though that I had Arnold in my grips and that he will be part of the confusion soon and just learn to love it. Its so good and I love counting my confusions like turning on the lights without turning anything on and nor having any electricity. I like how I show my kindness by angrily shouting verbal abuse at people and I love visiting doctors because I have nothing wrong with me and I demand they cure because I have nothing. Arnold gone now and he is kneeling down and its like he can’t take it anymore.

That’s it Arnold be my brother and be among the confused, be among the naked by wearing clothes, be among the senseless and illogical, be among the confusion. I go up to Arnold by not going up to him and he looks at me with the look that he is enjoying the confusion now and even some of his followers try to help him but it useless now, the confusion has set in and he will enjoy it, he will relish it and his mind will bend by not bending and all of the negative juices of the brain will leak out and he will be better. Are you confused yet by what I have told you. Don’t worry it will come to you and you will be in love.  ",1,1749212270.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

I love being confused and its just such a wonderful feeling when you don’t know something properly. Confusion stretches and massages the brain and squeezes all of the depression and anxiety from out of the brain. When I get confused it is an amazing moment and I get a rush of euphoria and joy that no other person could compete with. 

Oh I love confusing people even more and I hate those who lead a life that makes sense or try to make sense out of confusing things. These people are the destroyers of joy and they should be crushed and destroyed with not one atom left of them. I remember a couple of months back I saw my ceiling moving up and down inside the house and I was astounded once more at how this was happening and why I wasn’t crushed. It was incredible and how my ceiling was moving up and down and not changing the whole house was brain teasing. I could feel a good stretch in my brain and a good needed stretch was needed. I then saw a train coming out of my cupboard and the people inside the train were puking on each other. They were puking different colours on each other.
I had no idea what to make of all of this and I was so happy with what I was experiencing and how I couldn’t explain it. I loved this so much and I loved confusion more than my children who starved to death because I over fed them. I don’t know how they could have starved with the amount of food I had given them but then again, I was becoming high at the senselessness of it all. I love confusion more than my wife who I married on the moon without any space suit and I remember the wedding and how impossible it was, all of it. Although there we both were getting married on the actual moon and even my time table for work is confusing where it says my day off is at the same time as my working day, and that’s why I love my job.

My life is perfect because nothing makes sense and I don’t want anything to make sense in my life and I want things to happen without cause or effect. I once shot my gun at my friends head and all of a sudden he didn’t smell of body odour anymore. My friend had always struggled with the way he smelled and people in public would always move seats in public transports, but ever since I shot him in the head he smells amazing now. I love this and my brain is having a party and a wild ride and I don’t want it to stop like ever. I remember getting a taxi and the taxi never moved from its place and when I got out of the taxi, I was now at my destination. I then started to argue with the taxi that because he never actually moved his car I didn’t really owe him money. The taxi driver then started arguing with me at how logical I was being and he was right. I paid him extra and I started to burn my tongue with lava as punishment for making sense and instead of pain, I instead became a great singer for a while.

Then there is Arnold who is always doing things that make sense and I hate Arnold. The worst thing about Arnold is that he brings his logical straight forward world into other peoples lives and it also straightens out their lives for a bit. Everything starts to make sense and logical and the terror of everything making sense is just too torturous for me. I have warned Arnold of ever coming close to me and infecting my life with his life. Arnold tries to speak to me about things that make sense and I try to ignore but as my ears and mind absorb what Arnold is trying to say, everything in my life starts to straighten out. Heating things makes things hotter and cooling things makes things colder. I then punch Arnold and instead of falling he gets transported to a library. Then everything in my life becomes confusing again and I have a sigh of relief about it. Everyday I count the blessings that is confusion and I count them and I praise the confusion that gives me so much joy and laughter. People like Arnold makes things hardened and rough with their logic and sense where everything must go in a certain way and I don’t like that at all. I prefer it when I try to turn left on a road that it becomes right and when I crash into a car, I end up in Barbados. This is the way the world should always be.

As I see Arnold desperately trying to speak with he people inside the library about logic and sense I count the blessing of confusion. I cut down trees by placing a pillow on the tree and I drown by not going into the water. I breath in air by not breathing in air and I run by not running and by realising these things it gives my brain such a great massage. Honestly the brain needs a great massage and I could feel of the juicy tensions dripping away from my brain and it feels oh so marvellous. I burned my daughter with ice cream even though I never had a daughter but every day I hug my daughter even though I never got married, even though I got married on the moon. It’s the guy Arnold again trying to interrupt my counting of blessing that is confusion and as he comes closer to me, his aura starts to effect the world that I love and know. Everything starts to make sense and time seems to flow more correctly and what’s up is up and what’s down is down. Its just so horrible when things make sense and I don’t know who would want to live in a world like this.

I push Arnold and I run away from him by not running away and to fight against Arnolds is by doing something confusing that doesn’t make sense. I count more blessings of all of the confusion that I experience in my day to day life. I shopped around and paid money with it even though I never have money and I am penniless, the world got destroyed today but I am still here and I got a birthday present for someone who will never be born. Yes I felt more better now and especially when that Arnold guy ruins my life for a moment. Who does that Arnold think he is going up to people and straightening out their lives and making their brains feel more stiffer and rigid. Today I also met my worst enemy and I also didn’t meet him and realising that caused an opening in my brain and flooded with so much good feelings and I was in heaven. I said hello to people who weren’t there and I flooded a country with no water. My remote wasn’t working because the batteries had ran out of charge and so I got it working by not replacing it with batteries that do work. I walked on ground that were made of air and I pulled teeth out of people who had no teeth.


I love counting my blessing of confusion and I gave bald people haircuts and freed dogs by getting them more leeches. I knocked on a house by never knocking and I solved a problem even though there was no problem to start off with and I couldn’t stop counting all of the confusing blessings in my life. I was hopping with joy and licking other peoples ice creams and holding hands with people with no hands. Then Arnold was close by and his gathering was growing bigger and I couldn’t believe that his following was increasing. I couldn’t believe that people were listening to Arnold about logic and things making sense and I knew that he will infect those people by making their lives move in a straight line. Arnold you are a destroyer of good things and an asshole to begin with and the things that I want do to you Arnold for ruining peoples lives with idea of logic and things making sense is an abomination. Its not just an abomination but an travesty and you should be hanged Arnold for giving such idea of sense and logic. Nothing should make sense and nothing should ever go with the flow and life should be confusing because a confusing life is just amazing.

I cook food without cooking and eat without eating and I cannot imagine what your life is like Arnold and I couldn’t even be in the same room as you.

1l4qw2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/thrillerbooks/comments/1l4qw2v/crossfire_in_the_canyons_an_elvis_cole_x_alex/,Crossfire in the Canyons: An Elvis Cole x Alex Delaware mashup,"2 of my favourite series of thrillers are Robert Crais' Elvis Cole books, and Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware books. A couple days ago, I had this idea, so I asked ChatGPT to outline a short story of about 10.000 words, combining the 2 universes. Why 10.000? I had previously asked for an average word count of Stephen King's short stories, which I enjoy a lot. In spite of outliers on both ends, the average was between 9.000 and 10.000 words.

Since both Elvis Cole and Alex Delaware live and work in contemporary Los Angeles, I asked ChatGPT to come up with a story where Elvis Cole (and his friend/colleague Joe Pike) meet Alex Delaware (and his cop-partner, Milo Sturgis) while investigating a crime, which they then solve together by making use of their respective strengths and methods.

Anyway. I thought this was an interesting experiment, and you can read the result underneath! I'm curious to hear your opinion about the story, especially if you're familiar with The Elvis Cole and Alex Delaware thrillers.

Last but not least, considering both the linguistic and narrative quality of the result, neither Robert Crais nor Jonathan Kellerman need to be worried about being replaced by AI anytime soon ;-D

>***Crossfire in the Canyons***

>I.  
The girl lay in the dirt, eyes closed, a bottle of sleeping pills nearby. Morning fog curled through the Hollywood Hills like the breath of something ancient. Detective Milo Sturgis stood above the scene, arms folded, jaw set. ""Seventeen years old. Father runs a billion-dollar defense-tech company. Suicide note on her phone. But something smells off.""

>""You called me because you smell it?"" Alex Delaware asked, crouching beside the girl. The psychologist's tone was even, but his eyes were wary.

>""I called you because this isn't just another teenage suicide.""

>Milo paced the perimeter, eyes scanning for more than the obvious. ""She was found by a jogger. No witnesses. No camera footage worth a damn.""

>Alex looked over the girl again. ""Lack of hesitation wounds. She didn’t want to die.""

>Milo nodded. ""And the parents?""

>""Father’s a control freak. Mother’s emotionally tuned out, except now she wants answers.""

>Alex stood and looked at the hills. ""Let’s find out who wanted her dead.""

>

>II.  
Three miles away in a sun-drenched office lined with vintage Spider-Man memorabilia, Elvis Cole read the same suicide note. The girl’s mother, distraught and disbelieving, sat across from him.

>""She was a good kid. Moody, sure. But this? This wasn't her.""

>Elvis nodded. ""I’ll need access to her room, her phone, and every friend she had.""

>Joe Pike didn’t say a word. He stood in the corner like a statue carved from quiet violence.

>The mother handed over a zip drive. ""Everything I pulled from her laptop. She was on it constantly.""

>Elvis flipped the drive in his hand. ""We’ll find out what she wasn’t saying.""

>Cole and Pike visited the girl’s room. Elvis took in the minimalism—not typical of a teen. No posters, few books. Her laptop, dust-free, was the only sign of daily use.

>Pike flipped through a sketchbook on the shelf. Mostly landscapes. Some darker ones: an empty canyon, a faceless man, a door without a handle.

>""Visual metaphors for entrapment,"" Elvis said. Pike raised a brow. ""I took one psych class.""

>Meanwhile, Alex Delaware performed a psychological autopsy. He noticed signs in the girl’s social media of isolation, erratic emotional shifts, and references to someone called ""Coach.""

>He interviewed two of her teachers and a guidance counselor.

>""She was bright,"" one said. ""But her moods tanked fast this semester.""

>""Any bullying?"" Alex asked.

>""Not that we saw. But she did withdraw from her friends.""

>Alex studied her journal, obtained from her locker. Entries shifted from poetic and vibrant to detached and minimal. One line stuck out: \*'Coach says I have to shed my skin to be free.'\*

>

>III.  
Elvis knocked on the office door of Dr. Felicia Hayes, the girl's former therapist. It opened to reveal Milo Sturgis, badge on hip and suspicion in his eyes.

>""You again,"" Milo grunted. ""You working this?""

>""Hired by the mother,"" Elvis said, raising his hands. ""Not stepping on your toes. Just sniffing the ground.""

>Alex appeared behind Milo. ""Maybe we don’t need to step on toes. Maybe we walk together.""

>Inside, Dr. Hayes fidgeted with her coffee mug. ""She stopped coming two months ago. Said she was handling things with her life coach.""

>""Name?"" Milo asked.

>Hayes hesitated. ""Confidentiality is—""

>""Not when the client is dead and it may be homicide,"" Elvis said quietly.

>Hayes relented. ""Ryan Karn. She mentioned him often. Very charismatic. Unorthodox.""

>Elvis and Milo exchanged a glance.

>""We'll look into him,"" Milo said.

>

>IV.  
Cole and Pike tracked down two of the girl’s closest friends. One was in rehab. The other had disappeared. The common thread? A secret group online, led by someone known only as ""Coach.""

>Elvis visited a social media influencer conference under the guise of writing a piece for a magazine. The crowd was a blur of ring lights, curated personalities, and empty charisma. He spotted Karn from afar, holding court.

>""He looks like the type who charges for breathing exercises,"" Elvis muttered.

>Pike watched silently, clocking security, exits, and the way Karn's staff flinched at his movements.

>They obtained a flyer for Karn's upcoming weekend retreat. ""Self-Transformation: Unlock Your Inner Genius."" Held at a compound in Benedict Canyon.

>Milo tapped into LAPD’s cybercrimes unit. ""Coach"" had cropped up in connection with two other deaths, both staged as suicides, both from privileged families.

>""He's not just some troll,"" Alex said. ""This is someone who understands behavioral manipulation. Deeply.""

>Joe Pike tailed Karn back to a gated compound in Benedict Canyon. He noted the guards, the cameras, and the nondescript SUVs coming and going at all hours.

>""Cultish vibes,"" Elvis said when Pike reported back.

>""He's weaponized influence,"" Alex added. ""This isn't coaching. It's control.""

>

>V.  
Pike's silent tail of Karn ended with a drive-by shooting in an Echo Park parking lot. Pike avoided it. Barely.

>""Somebody just fired a warning shot,"" Elvis said.

>""Or tried to close a case permanently,"" Milo added.

>Elvis had the bullet analyzed. Standard 9mm, no serial. Clean.

>Pressure mounted. The girl’s father issued statements. Lawyers started circling. Alex, digging through university archives, found that ""Coach"" had once published under a different name: Dr. Evan Raine, a disgraced behavioral scientist.

>Raine had once run experiments on teenage conformity and susceptibility. He vanished after ethics violations shuttered his lab.

>""So he pivoted to monetizing control,"" Alex said. ""Influencers. Teens. Vulnerable minds.""

>Milo went to Internal Affairs for help navigating the case around political pressure. ""We go around them, not through them.""

>Elvis hacked into one of Raine's cloud drives, courtesy of a contact. The drive contained detailed psychological profiles, data collection logs, and coded names. The victim was among them.

>

>VI.  
They set up a sting. LAPD used a young female informant, posed as a recruit to Coach’s influencer group. She arranged a meetup at a secluded wellness retreat in Topanga Canyon.

>The informant, Tasha, had been a runaway. Now, she was cleaned up and brave enough to bait a predator.

>They trained her with Alex’s help, using roleplay and scripts. She memorized responses, practiced feigned vulnerability, rehearsed questions to provoke Raine.

>Pike and Milo waited in a borrowed surveillance van. Elvis monitored from a bluff with binoculars, earpiece in place. Alex was stationed nearby with a trauma response kit, just in case.

>Coach arrived. He looked ordinary. Too ordinary. That made him more dangerous.

>He began his pitch to Tasha with practiced ease. ""You don’t need your parents, your school, or your old life. You just need focus. You need to break free.""

>""Like she did?"" Tasha asked, subtly naming the victim.

>Coach paused. Then smiled. ""She was special. But she couldn’t let go.""

>That was enough.

>Milo moved first. Pike flanked. Elvis revved the Jeep and blocked the driveway.

>Coach panicked. Drew a weapon.

>Pike didn’t.

>One clean shot to the shoulder. He collapsed, howling.

>Alex reached Tasha within seconds. She was shaking.

>""You did great,"" Alex said. ""He’s done.""

>

>VII.  
Back at the precinct, Raine cracked under questioning. The deaths were part of a broader plan to test influence—how far he could push until someone broke.

>""They were experiments to him,"" Milo said, disgusted.

>""He never stopped being a researcher,"" Alex added. ""Just stopped pretending he had ethics.""

>Raine’s files detailed stages of control: identification, isolation, indoctrination, destruction. He had run the same model across multiple victims.

>Meanwhile, the media devoured the story. Headlines blared: \*Suicide Cult Leader Exposed\*. Parents demanded accountability. The defense-tech CEO denied knowledge, but an internal audit revealed his company funded one of Raine's ""wellness retreats.""

>Cole stood on the bluff where the girl had been found.

>""She never had a chance,"" he said to Pike.

>""Now others might.""

>

>VIII.  
Coach, aka Evan Raine, was charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, coercion, and accessory to murder.

>The girl’s death was ruled a homicide.

>Her father’s company took a media beating when connections to Raine surfaced. His empire, and reputation, crumbled.

>The remaining members of the secret group Raine ran were deprogrammed with the help of licensed professionals. Survivors testified. The D.A. built a watertight case.

>A week later, Cole and Delaware sat on the patio of a Santa Monica café.

>""You think he believed his own garbage?"" Elvis asked.

>Alex sipped his espresso. ""He believed he could control anything. Even death.""

>""Good thing we didn’t believe him.""

>Joe Pike watched the horizon.

>Milo muttered, ""I still don’t like private eyes.""

>Alex smiled. ""But you like results.""

1l4qtky,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThredUp/comments/1l4qtky/prices_jumping_literally_overnight/,Prices jumping literally overnight,"Another complaining post, sorry in advance!

I've been spending way too much time on Thredup lately because I don't really have many cute 'hot weather' clothes in my wardrobe and wanted to add some this year instead of feeling like a sweaty, ugly gremlin all summer. I hang around a lot on the new arrivals tab and last night saw a super cute tank top that I immediately added to my cart.

However I started feeling undecided because while listed as 'excellent' the pictures clearly show that half the bottom hem has unraveled. It was also 27.99! I was going back and forth on whether it would be worth it to buy and try to repair myself (I have never so much as held a needle and thread in my life; 1 a.m. delusions lol). Well it expired out of my cart while I was deliberating and someone else added it to theirs so that was that. I went to bed.

This morning I go to the site to drink my coffee and check the new arrivals tab as is my ritual and saw that it's now $29.99 😪 I understand them trying to get as much money as possible if it's in high demand but it's not like 50+ people have hearted it, only 5 have including me. And like...it's used! And damaged! And a tank top! 

I dunno, I just thought it was wild to see it jump in price literally overnight. And just such a high price to begin with honestly. I've been really wanting to add some jeans to my wardrobe but can't ever find any on TU because the only halfway decent pairs are almost retail price. It seems silly to pay $35+ dollars for jeans on TU (and half the time they're not even as described) when I can get them brand new and have the option to exchange at a retail store.

I can still find some good steals on there if I really put the time and effort in and have a decent promo code but yeah, just disappointing to see how high the prices are anymore. I know they need to make money and everything's really expensive right now but I don't have any money either, man, that's why I'm here🥲

Totally unrelated P.S.: has anyone noticed the new AI images they're using to model the clothes? I just noticed them for the first time this morning. I had to laugh when one of the images showed a solid tan tank top when the actual item is tan with big stripes. Personally I'd rather just have more accurate/additional pictures of the actual item but that's just me.",5,1749211883.0,ThredUp,2,1.0,False
1l4qt4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1l4qt4g/i_finally_messaged_an_old_friend_and_it_turned/,I finally messaged an old friend and it turned out amazingly well but I'm not sure what to do next with it,"So I'll try to summarize. might be a bit of a ramble.

Basically I was friends with this girl way back in school...16 years ago or so...ouch! She was one of the cool popular girls and I was a short weird autistic kid but for some reason we ended up being really great friends online and would chat on MSN for hours.

I always felt like she didn't really fit in with the popular girl life so I felt a strong connection to her but at the same time I definitely didn't fit in with her life at the time so it was difficult for me, I convinced myself that she probably didn't really like me at all and she had a lot of mean girl friends who would tell me to stop talking to her, so I basically told her I'd stop talking to her and was sorry for being weird and messaging her all the time.


And I've always regretted it. We live near each other and I've seen her from time to time and thought about saying hello, the other day I saw her in a store but I had barely slept and she looks a lot different so I didn't recognize her and didn't want to say hi to some random lady. Ended up summing up the courage to apologise online the next day and we had a small chat.


------


For years I'd been meaning to apologise to her for how I ended our friendship etc and my anxiety had been getting to me all week about this but...I finally messaged her again last night to explain and...it went better than I ever could have imagined, she thought way more highly of me than I realized and it turns out I was right about her not fitting in, she's not friends with anyone she used to know when we were young because they all turned out to be horrible people that used her. So these days she only has a small circle of good friends she met elsewhere later in life. In a way it sounds like I was probably the best friend she had in school in terms of actually being a *friend*.


She really appreciated me messaging her and we had a good long talk about how things have been, it was great. I made sure to tell her that I'm not just trying to fish for an invitation in to her life because I would never be pushy like that.

But at the same time...I would really like to be her friend for real if she'd have me. We both said we can message each other any time and all that stuff but it's kind of hard to convince myself I'm worthy of her attention you know? Back then our friendship was like 99.99% online and these days I kind of suck at maintaining online friendships so if possible I would like to hang out with her in person some time...but I know not to ask that and again wouldn't want to be pushy.


I told that if she ever wanted to chat or go grab a coffee or see a movie or something I'd be happy to see her and that I don't expect anything either way, ball totally in her court.


I'm not entirely sure what to do now though? That kind of dark negative part of me says ""Good now don't ever annoy her again"" but honestly I'm kinda lonely and it'd be super nice to go from the one proper friend I have to two. 
Just not really sure how well I fit in with her life these days, she's a decently outgoing person who does normal people stuff like going out to drink and with me being autistic and hating alcohol that side of life very isn't for me. I'd prefer to sit and watch a movie or cook us a meal. She'd probably be a bit bored or maybe uncomfortable by it just being the two of us and given how cool and good looking she is I'd be surprised if she doesn't have a boyfriend who undoubtedly would not be cool with us hanging that way.

For now I'm thinking...just wait? It seems unlikely but *maybe* she'll message me and if not in a week or two I'll just ask her how she's doing? I'm so bad at overthinking it and the days go by so slow just thinking and thinking.",1,1749211842.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best gold MacBook keyboard covers of 2025 are defined by a combination of durability, aesthetics, and functionality.

**Material Quality:** The material used is critical for both protection and aesthetics. The leading covers frequently enough employ premium thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) or silicone-based materials. These materials offer excellent resistance to abrasion, tears, and discoloration. A superior cover will maintain its gold finish over extended use, resisting fading and scratches. In addition, the material should be non-toxic and safe for prolonged contact with skin.

**Thickness and Transparency:** The ideal thickness strikes a balance between protection and usability. Too thick,and the cover can hinder typing speed and tactile feedback. Too thin, and it provides minimal protection. High-quality covers typically range between 0.1mm and 0.3mm in thickness. Transparency is also critically important, especially for MacBooks with backlit keyboards. A clear or partially translucent cover allows the backlighting to shine through, enhancing visibility in low-light environments.

**Fit and Precision:** A well-designed keyboard cover should fit snugly and precisely over the keys, conforming to the contours of each keycap. This precision fit prevents the cover from slipping or shifting during use,ensuring a pleasant and accurate typing experience. Precision molding techniques and laser cutting are frequently enough used to achieve this level of accuracy. The best covers also feature raised edges around the keys to prevent dust and debris from accumulating underneath.

**Touch Sensitivity and Typing Comfort:** The tactile feel of a keyboard cover greatly influences the typing experience. High-quality covers are engineered to minimize interference with the natural feel of the keys. They frequently enough feature a smooth, matte finish that reduces slipperiness and enhances grip. Advanced manufacturing processes ensure that the keys maintain their responsiveness,allowing for comfortable and efficient typing.

**Adhesion and Removal:** Gold MacBook keyboard covers should adhere securely to the keyboard without the need for adhesives that can damage the keycaps. many covers use a form-fitting design and non-slip properties to stay in place. A high-quality cover will also be easy to remove and reapply without leaving any residue or causing wear and tear to the keyboard.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality gold MacBook keyboard cover offers several tangible benefits for users.

**Enhanced Protection:** A primary benefit is the protection it provides against accidental spills, crumbs, dust, and other contaminants. This safeguard prevents damage to the internal components of the MacBook, possibly saving costly repairs. The cover acts as a barrier, deflecting liquids and particles away from the sensitive electronics beneath the keys. It is useful for individuals who frequently eat or drink near their MacBooks.

**Extended Keyboard Lifespan:** By shielding the keys from wear and tear, a keyboard cover extends the life of the keyboard itself. Over time, the natural oils from your fingers can degrade the keycaps, causing them to become shiny and worn. A cover prevents this degradation, preserving the original appearance and functionality of the keys. Those who use their MacBooks heavily for extended periods will find this especially beneficial.

**Improved Hygiene:** Keyboard covers are easy to clean and sanitize, promoting better hygiene. Unlike the keyboard itself, which can be challenging and time-consuming to clean thoroughly, a cover can be quickly wiped down with a damp cloth or disinfectant. This helps eliminate germs and bacteria, making it a more sanitary option for shared workspaces or personal use. It is indeed ideal for individuals concerned about maintaining a clean and healthy workspace.

**Personalized Aesthetics:** A gold keyboard cover adds a touch of personalization and style to your MacBook. It allows you to express your individual taste and preferences, transforming your device into a reflection of your personality. The gold finish complements the sleek design of the MacBook, enhancing its overall aesthetic appeal.Users who appreciate visual customization will love this.

**Resale Value Preservation:** Maintaining the original condition of your MacBook, including the keyboard, can significantly increase its resale value. A keyboard cover helps preserve the integrity of the keys, ensuring they remain clean and undamaged. This contributes to the overall appearance of the MacBook, making it more attractive to potential buyers when you decide to upgrade or sell it. Users planning to resell their MacBooks in the future will benefit.

1l4qso3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1l4qso3/situationship_advice/,Situationship advice,"Hello,

I honestly have no where else to speak about this and decided to write a post here.

It is a long post, so thank you in advance for reading it. 

I am a man, in my 30s and met another man 2 months ago. We moved from the dating app to WhatsApp fairly quickly.

He was new to my country and we connected on his day 2 here. We met up after speaking for 2 days and it extremely well. We then continue to WhatsApp each other daily for the past two months, with consistent meet ups, etc.

I helped him narrow down his apartment searching (by recommending him the good areas) and also brought him to furniture shopping. I even brought him to different part of my country just to show him around.

We talked about past relationships, love languages, etc. However, this is something he said in the beginning - he is not actively looking for love or relationship, but if one comes his way, he wouldn't shy away from it. 

When we WhatsApp each other, we actively update each other on how our day is going.

In our four weeks mark, I brought up the ""what are we"" question. He said he sees us as good friends and would very much love to see where this could go. 
He still very much would love intimacy with me and hanging out with me.

Something then shifted after. It felt like he was more intentional and he got closer. He would even say things like ""enjoyed the intimacy at the couch"", ""I'm drunk, wanna cuddle"", ""when can we have our morning coffee?"", etc. He often also asks my opinion before purchasing the household appliance and said the husband needs to ask the wife before purchasing anything. 
Of course, there are many more to our connections and many moments where it felt real and genuine and we both acknowledged that moment was special. 

But some things I've noticed were - he reacts strongly to the word ""love"". I shared a story about my colleague doing something stupid for her ex boyfriend and said ""because she loves him"". His response was ""Ahhh fuck off"". And I know the idea of being in a relationship always turns him off. 

Things were great until we went to a party together. We had dinner together and we had so much fun, before the party. But I felt a major shift after the night. 

During the week after immediately the party, I could sense a shift in our communications drastically. I asked if things were okay, but he said he is exhausted mentally.

We went from updating each other actively, to becoming a summary report at the end of the day or start of the day, or message left unanswered and the next morning our conversations would continue without answering the previous text.

So I spoke to him about it last week.

He said that during the party, I tried to hold his hands multiple times and he felt that boundaries were crossed. He also said that I tried to put my head on his shoulders and similarly, boundaries were crossed. But he is aware that we did drink a lot, to the point where I've forgotten I've actually done that.
And when I asked if I could stay over at his after, he declined as well as similarly, boundaries.

I apologised for all of that, and said I genuinely forgotten all of that. But all of these also raised another question. Why are you reacting so strongly and what are we actually? 

He said he does not want to have any labels, or any sort of timeline because any form of these would be pressure. If he label us as ""dating"", then that would mean something. If he says ""relook in 3/6/12 months"", then he will be pressured as well when the time is near. And who knows what will change in the middle? If he meets someone else and suddenly fall quickly and deeply, then his ""promise"" to me would be broken as well.
So he sees this as ""good friends with benefits"".

I told him in that case, I'd keep my options opened as well, since I don't date multiple people at once.

He respected it. But we both agreed, if we have any sort of sexual activity with someone else, we will have to let each other know out of health and safety reasons. He told me he currently is not sexually active and hasn't met anyone else yet.

It has been a week after we had that conversation and our communication remain cold and surface. 

He is still active on dating app. So I guess it is just a matter of time before he meets someone and eventually have fun with someone else.

I'm not saying he is the worst person, because looking back at these past two months, I have been very intense with how I've been showing up. 

He joked about coffee in bed, I've showed up twice unannounced, just to have coffee with him before work. I've also always ask for his availability to ""book"" the next date. When he got sunburnt, I showed up with aloe vera gel unannounced as well. 

I also always bring gifts when I meet him because those were ""thought of you"" gifts - but looking back, there were a lot of gifts. 

I could also see how suffocating and pressurising it must have been, if he's someone who doesn't see this as ""anything"". I've made myself too readily available which put him on a pedestal.

Now here's the question - what should I do from here on? I am done spiralling and wonder about the ""what ifs"". I like him a lot and would definitely want this to work out. But I am also not going to be delusional and hold onto something that is dying.

My current thought process is - 
""Let's just be friends with no benefits. We clearly connected well and we enjoy each other presence. So we could just share life and have meals together. Skip the whole daily updates like we need to be accountable to each other. Let's just be friends and let things unfold itself naturally.""

Let me know if this is the right way to do it. 

Also, I've imported wines for him for his birthday next week. I've paid a lot of money on this, so what should I do with them? I'm not really a wine guy, so honestly, they have not much use for me.

1l4qqta,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1l4qqta/transitioning_to_ux_roleconsidering_mac_as_my/,Transitioning to UX Role/Considering Mac as my work and personal PC.,"Hi everyone!

I’m in the market for a new laptop mainly for UX work — think Figma, prototyping, light photo editing, research, and documentation (emails, reports, the usual). I’ve been eyeing Mac laptops because of all the good reviews on battery life and reliability — two things you can’t mess around with when you’re constantly moving between home, coffee shops, and out-of-town work setups.

Before I pull the trigger though, I’d love to hear your thoughts — Mac or non-Mac, baka may ma-recommend kayo na better or more sulit for a UX designer.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

Long battery life (non-negotiable — can’t be hunting for outlets mid-project)

Reliable performance (smooth multitasking — Figma tabs, Notion docs, Asana tasks, AI tools, all running at once)

Portability (I’m often out working in coffee shops or traveling outside Manila, so nothing too heavy)

Budget: Flexible, but preferably not over $1000 USD/ ₱60K PHP


If you’ve had a great experience with a Mac or a Windows laptop that can rival it in battery and performance, I’d really love to hear your recommendations!

Side note: I’m also thinking of getting an iPad since there’s an app called Mockup that’s only available on Mac/iOS. So a Mac might make more sense? 🤔

She moved in with me and in the beginning everything was great. I loved seeing her every morning and showering her with gifts. She even planned a cute date where we painted together (she's an artist, I am very much not). 
But after a while the routine settled in and tbh I was a little disappointed. I didn't expect her to help with the hard work (I'm a farmer) but I thought maybe she'd feed our cats every day. She does try, but it just doesn't feel like she's putting in any effort. 
For example she sometimes tells me she wanted to water the crops, but I have sprinklers. Or she makes me a coffee and is very proud of that but we have an automated coffee maker. She never goes to bed with me and is always up before I am. But thats all minor things and I do like to spoil her. 
What really bothers me is that while she's very cute at home, she basically treats me like a stranger when we're out in public. She greets me like before we were together when I run into her in town. She doesn't tell me where she's going and will even go to an island resort without telling me (or asking me to join her). She never invites me anywhere. 

A few days ago there was this big dance party in town (our town is a very tight knit community and there are town fairs and festivals very regularly). After finishing my work on the farm that day I went to the dance. My wife was already there, chatting with a friend. She greeted me with something along the lines of ""How nice to see you here"". WTF? You saw me this morning? I was really hurt and to hurt her back I asked my ex-boyfriend to dance with me, in front of her. 
I felt really bad about it. I just didn't feel seen by her lately and wanted her to acknowledge me. I regretted it nearly immediately but when I tried to talk to her the next day, she acted like nothing happend. That hurt me even more. I actually think she doesn't care, like this is no big deal. That makes this so much worse. 
I'll admit that I used to date several people in town and in a small community like this, word gets around. I liked spending time with several people and maybe I (accidentally) led some of them on. For me that was in the past when I got married. The whole town was there, they all supported us. 

But now I'm wondering if my wife doesn't take this marriage as seriously as I do. I was so happy and proud when everyone came to our wedding, but she will barely talk to me in public. 
So, AITA for trying (and failing) to make my wife jealous? Is there anything I can do to strengthen this relationship? ",3,1749211507.0,StardewValley,3,1.0,False

# Best Composting Worms 2025: Reviews & How to Choose

Composting worms, also known as red wigglers or Eisenia fetida, are nature's tiny recyclers, playing a crucial role in turning kitchen scraps and yard waste into nutrient-rich compost. This compost, often referred to as worm castings, is a fantastic soil amendment that enhances plant growth and improves soil structure. Choosing the right composting worms is essential for a successful vermicomposting system, and this guide will help you navigate the options and select the best worms for your needs in 2025. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just starting out, understanding the different types of composting worms and their specific characteristics will ensure a thriving compost bin and abundant, healthy plants.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of composting worms depend on several factors. These include the species of worm, their health upon arrival, their reproductive rate, and their tolerance to varying environmental conditions.

**Species of Worm:** The most common and highly recommended species for vermicomposting is Eisenia fetida, commonly known as red wigglers. These worms are surface dwellers that thrive in decomposing organic matter and are highly efficient at breaking down waste. Other species, such as Eisenia hortensis (European nightcrawlers), can also be used, but they are generally better suited for composting in the soil rather than in bins.

**Health and Vigor:** Healthy worms are essential for a successful vermicomposting system. Look for worms that are lively, active, and have a vibrant red color. Avoid worms that appear sluggish, pale, or have lesions. A reputable supplier will ensure that the worms are properly cared for and shipped in optimal conditions to minimize stress.

**Reproductive Rate:** A high reproductive rate is desirable because it allows the worm population to grow quickly, enabling them to process more waste. Red wigglers are prolific breeders, and under ideal conditions, their population can double every 60-90 days. This rapid reproduction ensures a continuous supply of worms to break down your organic waste.

**Environmental Tolerance:** Composting worms are sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature and moisture levels. Red wigglers thrive in temperatures between 55°F and 80°F (13°C and 27°C) and require a moist but not soggy environment. They are also sensitive to acidity, so it's important to maintain a neutral pH in the compost bin.

**Purity of Culture:** A good composting worm culture should consist primarily of the intended species (e.g., Eisenia fetida). Contamination with other worm species or pests can reduce the efficiency of the composting process and potentially harm the worm population. Reputable suppliers take measures to ensure the purity of their worm cultures.

**Shipping and Handling:** The way worms are shipped and handled can significantly impact their survival rate. Worms should be packaged in breathable containers with adequate bedding material to keep them moist and protected during transit. Prompt delivery and proper acclimation upon arrival are also crucial for ensuring their well-being.

 ## Core Benefits

Composting worms offer numerous benefits for both the environment and the gardener. From reducing waste to creating nutrient-rich fertilizer, these tiny creatures provide a sustainable and effective way to improve soil health and plant growth.

**Waste Reduction:** Composting worms can significantly reduce household waste by consuming kitchen scraps, yard waste, and other organic materials. By diverting this waste from landfills, vermicomposting helps conserve valuable resources and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. A well-maintained worm bin can process a considerable amount of organic waste, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional composting methods.

**Nutrient-Rich Fertilizer:** Worm castings, the end product of vermicomposting, are a highly valuable soil amendment. They are rich in essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as beneficial microorganisms that promote plant growth. Worm castings also improve soil structure, water retention, and aeration, creating an ideal environment for healthy root development.

**Improved Soil Health:** Adding worm castings to the soil enhances its overall health and fertility. The beneficial microorganisms in worm castings help break down organic matter, making nutrients more accessible to plants. Worm castings also improve the soil's ability to retain moisture, reducing the need for frequent watering. This leads to healthier, more resilient plants that are better able to withstand environmental stresses.

**Sustainable Gardening:** Vermicomposting is a sustainable gardening practice that reduces reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. By using worm castings as a natural fertilizer, gardeners can minimize their environmental impact and promote a healthier ecosystem in their gardens. Vermicomposting also helps close the loop by recycling organic waste and turning it into a valuable resource for plant growth.

**Easy and Convenient:** Vermicomposting can be done indoors or outdoors, making it accessible to gardeners of all types. Worm bins are relatively small and easy to maintain, requiring minimal space and effort. With proper care, a worm bin can provide a continuous supply of nutrient-rich compost for years to come.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about composting worms:

**How many worms do I need to start a compost bin?**
The number of worms you need depends on the size of your compost bin and the amount of waste you generate. A general rule of thumb is to start with about 1,000 red wigglers (approximately one pound) for a standard-sized compost bin (e.g., 2' x 2' x 1'). You can always add more worms later if needed.

**What do composting worms eat?**
Composting worms are voracious eaters and can consume a wide variety of organic materials, including kitchen scraps (fruits, vegetables, coffee grounds, tea bags), yard waste (leaves, grass clippings), shredded paper, and cardboard. Avoid feeding them meat, dairy products, oily foods, or citrus fruits in large quantities, as these can create unpleasant odors and disrupt the balance of the compost bin.

**How do I maintain a healthy worm bin?**
To maintain a healthy worm bin, it's important to provide the worms with a suitable environment. This includes maintaining a temperature between 55°F and 80°F (13°C and 27°C), keeping the bedding moist but not soggy, and providing adequate ventilation. Regularly check the pH of the compost bin and adjust as needed to maintain a neutral pH. Also, avoid overfeeding the worms, as this can lead to anaerobic conditions and foul odors.

**How do I harvest worm castings?**
There are several methods for harvesting worm castings, including the dump-and-sort method, the migration method, and the self-harvesting method. The dump-and-sort method involves dumping the contents of the worm bin onto a tarp and manually separating the worms from the castings. The migration method involves creating a new bedding area in one side of the bin and allowing the worms to migrate to the new area, leaving the castings behind. The self-harvesting method involves using a specialized worm bin with trays that allow the castings to be collected from the bottom.

I spent a few weeks on it, making sure that I didn't move on from each lesson until I felt fairly confident I had a basic grasp of what each exercise was asking me to do. I would say that I'm probably at 85-90% understanding of what the GDQuest stuff was asking. 

What I'm curious about is what should be my next steps. 

I've looked through similar threads as to what I'm asking, but there doesn't seem to be a general consensus for what newbies in GameDev/Programming should do. 

* CS50 Course
* Scratch Course
* freeCodeCamp Python course
* GDQuest Paid classes

  
For me, I'm leaning towards the last two. I've got a RetroPie that I love and I know that it uses Python as its language. I really don't plan on doing anything other than trying my hand at gamedev for personal stuff, so I don't \*think\* I need to look at other languages, but I really don't know. 

I don't mind spending the money on the paid class package from GDQuest, but I really don't know how good they are for people with no computer programming/game dev experience at all. 

As for what I want to do? I want to do the 20 Game Challenge and eventually make a driving game and a coffee themed game, sticking mainly to PSX-era graphics.

**Summary**:

Have you ever wondered why Saiki likes coffee jelly too much? Well, that's because of a little incident when he was little.

When he was just 2 years old, one day he ate a lot, too much, and from one moment to the next he fell asleep, almost as if he was hibernating. It took almost a month for him to wake up and it was because his father had brought a candy to see if it would wake him up, and it woke him up, that candy was coffee jelly. Since then, Saiki loves coffee jelly.

I have a 2020 CR-V 1.5T. This morning, EVERY single road to work was flooded. I never drive through high water, as I'm always afraid of damaging my car (had sedans for years so, even with the CR-V ground clearance, I just don't feel comfortable).

However, I did this morning and the engine shield plate at the bottom began scraping the road. I had to drive through additional high water (moving) after this happened. I got ""trapped"" in between multiple flooded roads. I am concerned that, without this shield, debris/water may have gotten into places it shouldn't. I was able to get underneath and get it to ""stay in place"" for now until I can take it back to my garage and get it back together. 

  
Any thoughts? Car runs fine. It's had a rough morning.... but she's running fine!

  
Also, Is this shield necessary to drive with on a daily basis?

I’d like to share an idea that blends both cultural significance and modern design: Istanbul-themed living spaces.

Just imagine… having an apartment in-game where your window opens to a view of the Galata Tower, or sipping coffee in a warm, minimalistic living room facing the Maiden’s Tower.
These aren’t just architectural structures — they are powerful emotional and cultural symbols for millions. And more importantly, they represent today’s urban youth, not just historical identity.

To reflect this concept, I’ve created two simple scene designs:
📸 [Image: Galata Tower View Bedroom]
📸 [Image: Maiden’s Tower View Living Room]

Each room features:
	•	Clean, modern interior design
	•	Warm lighting and daily-life details (laptop, LED lights, coffee mug)
	•	Istanbul’s skyline at sunset or nighttime

I believe these kinds of additions would not only build a stronger emotional bond with Turkish players, but also bring aesthetic variety to the game as a whole. Whether released as seasonal or premium content — they would truly fit beautifully into Avakin Life.

What do you think? Feel free to like and support if you’d love to see this added.

***In a move aimed at strengthening America’s critical minerals and defense capabilities, documents obtained exclusively by Reuters reveal that President Trump plans to utilize the emergency powers granted under the Defense Production Act. The intention is to bypass several legal requirements—including mandatory Congressional funding approvals—in order to accelerate domestic production of key minerals necessary for both the economy and national security.***

[Weekly Market Recap (June 6) – Trump Set to Invoke Defense Act for Critical Minerals - NAI 500](https://nai500.com/blog/2025/06/weekly-market-recap-june-6-trump-set-to-invoke-defense-act-for-critical-minerals/)

This initiative is viewed against the backdrop of China’s dominant position in the critical minerals arena. In response to the trade war launched by President Trump, Beijing recently employed export control measures on these strategic resources, prompting disruptions across the global supply chain.

In an [interview with METALS 100](https://nai500.com/blog/coverage/lfp-battery-industry-first-phosphate-corp-pdac-2024/), John Passalacqua, the CEO, and Director of [First Phosphate Corp. (CSE: PHOS) (OTC: FRSPF) (FSE: KD0)](https://nai500.com/companies/first-phosphate-corp/) talked about the LFP batteries market and the company’s project and the infrastructure in Quebec. First Phosphate is a mineral development company fully dedicated to extracting and purifying phosphate for the production of cathode active material for the LFP battery industry.

# According to the pre-released documents, the planned executive order will invoke emergency exemptions, including the following measures:

* ***Waiving the Congressional approval requirement for projects valued at more than US$50 million.***
* ***Overriding the rule that limits project delivery timeframes to one year.***

This is not the first time the measure has been used. In March, Trump tapped into the Defense Production Act for the first time to boost domestic production of critical minerals.

John Paul Helveston, a professor at George Washington University, cautions that while increased investment in the mining sector may provide a long-term solution, it is unlikely to free the United States from its short-term reliance on China’s trade policies. In other words, maintaining a consistent trade relationship with China will remain essential for securing mineral supplies over the next 5 to 10 years.

China currently leads the global rare earth market, responsible for extracting 70% of the world’s rare earth elements and processing 90% of these materials—not only domestically but also for Myanmar and nearly half of the used rare earths in the U.S. Although countries like Australia and Brazil are ramping up their production, significant short-term replacements for Chinese outputs remain unlikely. Experts further note that the U.S. is approximately 20 years behind China in heavy rare earth refining technologies, meaning that completely eliminating reliance on China could take at least a decade.

In parallel, China has been tightening its hold on rare earth exports. Recently, the country officially launched a tracking system for the rare earth magnet industry, requiring manufacturers to submit detailed transaction data—including trade volumes and client identities—online. This move suggests that the export controls on rare earths may be here to stay, serving as an important strategic bargaining chip for Beijing.

# JUNE 6th, 2025~U.S.–China Tech War Turns into Resource War China Tightens Rare Earth Export Controls, Targets the Real Economy

[U.S.–China Tech War Turns into Resource War: China Tightens Rare Earth Export Controls, Targets the Real Economy | The Economy](https://economy.ac/news/2025/06/20250653156)

https://preview.redd.it/f3dfp3te9a5f1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1f58fe6639b566388ee063fa41a1556100c696

What began as a battle over semiconductors and tariff policies between the United States and China is now entering a far more consequential and disruptive phase—a global resource war. As China escalates its export controls on rare earth elements, the ripples are being felt across the real economy, far beyond diplomatic circles and boardrooms. Manufacturing giants and small-scale producers alike are being hit by supply shocks, production delays, and growing uncertainty. What was once a largely intangible confrontation over technological supremacy is now a direct clash over the physical materials that power modern industry.

Nowhere is this shift more visible than in the tightening grip China holds over the rare earth market. These 17 critical elements are essential to the production of electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and advanced weapons systems. With China supplying over 90% of the world’s refined rare earths, its recent policy changes are more than administrative—they are reshaping global supply chains and triggering economic alarm bells.

# “Crackdown on Illegal Mining” Masks Strategic Intent

According to a June 4 report by China’s state-run *Securities Times*, local governments in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guizhou, and Hunan Province have intensified enforcement against what they describe as “illegal mining activities.” These actions are framed as responses to central government directives to tighten controls on the export of strategic minerals. A Guangxi provincial official declared, *“We will strengthen oversight of the mining and exploration sectors,”* vowing strict consequences for unauthorized operations and mining conducted outside designated zones.

But analysts suggest that this move goes far beyond law enforcement. Instead, it marks a pivotal moment in China’s strategic weaponization of its resource dominance. As geopolitical tensions with the United States deepen, Beijing is leveraging its control over rare earths to fortify its position. By requiring Chinese government approval before any export of these minerals, the new regulations effectively create a state-controlled choke point in the global supply chain.

This isn’t the first time China has pulled this lever. In previous disputes, it has threatened or implemented similar controls, particularly during trade stand-offs. What sets the current situation apart is the global scale of disruption and the rapid pace at which it’s unfolding.

Beijing insists that these actions are lawful and defensive. Chinese officials argue that it was Washington—not Beijing—that first broke trade agreements by restricting semiconductor equipment exports and blacklisting Chinese firms. From China’s perspective, the current measures are a proportional response. However, many observers view them as an unmistakable shift from traditional economic policy toward geoeconomic confrontation, signaling that China is willing to use its mineral dominance as leverage in a much broader battle for industrial and technological leadership.

# Rare Earths: The Indispensable Resource of Modern Industry

Rare earth elements are the unsung heroes behind nearly every modern technological innovation. Embedded in everything from smartphones and laptops to electric motors and missile guidance systems, they form the foundation of the 21st-century economy. Particularly vital are permanent magnets made from neodymium and dysprosium, which are essential for high-performance electric motors in electric vehicles, drones, and wind turbines.

Without these rare earths, electric motor production grinds to a halt, and with it, the industrial assembly lines of electric vehicles, home appliances, and defense technologies. This vulnerability is no longer hypothetical. In late May, Ford Motor Company announced a week-long shutdown of its Chicago assembly plant, citing a shortage of magnets—a direct result of supply disruptions originating from China.

The implications are massive. Leading manufacturing nations—including the United States, Japan, and Germany—have issued warnings that if China’s export restrictions persist, they could be forced to suspend some factory operations within weeks. The effects won’t be confined to one sector either. From aerospace to renewable energy to robotics, a wide swath of industries stands to be affected.

The construction and heavy machinery sectors are particularly exposed. Cranes, excavators, and electric tools rely on high-powered motors that use rare earth-based magnets. As industries transition from fossil fuel-powered engines to electric propulsion in line with global climate goals, the demand for rare earths is accelerating, even as supply security becomes increasingly precarious.

The consequences of these dynamics are already visible. As of last month, rare earth prices surged by over 40% year-over-year, and the trading volume for some key elements has dropped sharply due to hoarding and regulatory uncertainty. Many small and mid-sized manufacturers, particularly in Asia and Europe, are now struggling to maintain production, having failed to secure sufficient inventory before the supply crunch.

A recent report by the U.S. Department of Commerce explicitly acknowledged this vulnerability, warning that the EV and semiconductor industries are dangerously over-reliant on China. The report concluded that the U.S. currently lacks the flexibility and capacity to respond effectively to such a sudden and sustained external shock.

# Scenario of a Collapsing Tariff Truce Emerges

The intensifying rare earth squeeze is now casting a long shadow over the recent U.S.–China tariff truce, raising concerns that the fragile balance could unravel. On May 12, trade representatives from both nations met in Geneva and reached a tentative agreement to suspend or roll back most of the retaliatory tariffs for 90 days. It was viewed as a possible turning point in the tech and trade war.

But China’s subsequent decision to tighten rare earth export regulations has undermined that progress, casting doubt over the sincerity and durability of the détente. The shift from abstract trade policies to concrete restrictions on physical resources suggests that the confrontation is moving into uncharted, more disruptive territory.

Whereas earlier phases of the conflict revolved around tariffs, intellectual property, and semiconductor bans, the focus has now shifted to industrial raw materials—resources that are both finite and irreplaceable in the short term. This development risks triggering what some experts call a “resource nationalism era,” where access to critical commodities becomes the new battlefield of global competition.

China continues to defend its measures as legitimate trade policies. Yet the U.S. and its allies see them as a form of political blackmail, pointing to the broader economic fallout already underway. The fear is not just economic; it is structural. By undermining the efficacy of global trade frameworks—such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and bilateral trade agreements—these moves could usher in a fragmented world economy.

Washington and its partners argue that China’s actions could accelerate the formation of resource blocs, in which countries align themselves based on access to strategic materials. Such a shift would mark a profound transformation in global trade, eroding decades of interdependence in favor of rigid, rivalrous blocs competing for control over essential commodities.

* Fill water **up to the marked line in the cylinder**.
* The **puck and cylinder are tightly sealed**—I’ve checked multiple times to ensure there’s no air leak.
* But the **espresso comes out watery**, with **no crema**, and the **pressure gauge barely moves**.

1l4qc44,https://youtu.be/Dw2oXd5VAD4,3 Very Scary TRUE Amazon Rainforest Horror Stories,"# ""The Jungle Doesn’t Forgive"":

I stepped off the small plane in Manaus, the air heavy with the scent of damp earth and fuel. My heart thumped hard in my chest, a mix of nerves and purpose. I was here to investigate illegal logging in the Amazon, a story that could expose dangerous people and their crimes against the rainforest. My editor had warned me about the risks—journalists had gone missing before—but I couldn’t back out. The truth was too important. At the edge of the airstrip, a man stood waiting, his worn cap pulled low over his eyes. João, my guide, had a serious face, his skin weathered from years in the jungle.“You sure about this?” he asked, his voice low, barely audible over the hum of the departing plane. His eyes flicked to the crowd, scanning for trouble.I adjusted my backpack, the straps digging into my shoulders. “I have to do this,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt.He nodded, but his jaw tightened. “Let’s move, then.”We took a rickety bus to São Rafael, a tiny village on the edge of the rainforest. The road was more dirt than pavement, and the bus rattled so hard I thought it might fall apart. In the village, wooden houses leaned on stilts, their paint peeling from the constant moisture. The air buzzed with insects, and the distant calls of birds echoed from the trees. João led me to a small bar, its walls covered in faded photos of fishermen and riverboats. There, he introduced me to Maria, an elder with deep lines etched into her face. Her hands shook as she poured us coffee from a tin pot.“The forest protects its secrets,” she said, her voice a hoarse whisper. “Those men, the ones cutting trees, they don’t care about the land. They have guns. They’ve hurt people. Be careful, child.”Her words sent a chill through me, colder than the coffee in my hands. I thanked her, but her eyes followed me as we left, like she knew something I didn’t.The next morning, João and I set out. The jungle swallowed us whole, its trees towering so high they blocked out the sky. Vines hung like curtains, and the ground was a tangle of roots and mud that sucked at my boots. Every step was a fight, my legs burning from the effort. The sounds were relentless—birds shrieking, insects humming, leaves rustling like someone was watching. I caught glimpses of movement in the underbrush—a monkey swinging through branches, a flash of bright feathers—but it only made me feel smaller, like the jungle was alive and waiting.João pointed to a rubber tree, its trunk scarred with deep slashes where sap had been bled out. “This is nothing,” he said, his voice tight. “Deeper in, you’ll see the real damage.”We hiked for hours, my shirt soaked, my backpack heavier with every step. The jungle seemed to press closer, the air thick and hard to breathe. Then, a sound cut through the noise—a chainsaw, its high-pitched whine unnatural against the organic hum of the forest. João stopped dead, his hand grabbing my arm.“Get down,” he whispered, pulling me behind a massive fern. My heart pounded so loud I was sure it would give us away.Through the leaves, I saw them—three men, maybe more, in a clearing. One worked a chainsaw, slicing into a mahogany tree as tall as a building. Another stood watch, a rifle slung across his chest, his eyes scanning the trees. A third man stacked cut logs, his shirt stained with sweat. The tree groaned, then crashed to the ground, shaking the earth. The sound hit me like a punch.“They’re illegal loggers,” João said, his voice barely audible. “This area’s protected. They’re stealing.”I fumbled for my camera, my hands shaking as I zoomed in. I snapped photos of the men, the felled tree, the stacks of timber ready for smuggling. Each click felt too loud, like a gunshot in the silence. Then the man with the rifle turned, his head snapping toward us. His eyes locked on the fern, and my stomach dropped.“Hey!” he shouted, pointing. The others stopped, heads turning. The chainsaw went quiet.“Run!” João hissed, grabbing my hand.We bolted, crashing through vines and branches that clawed at my face and arms. My boots slipped in the mud, but João’s grip kept me upright. Behind us, the men’s shouts grew louder, their boots pounding the ground. A rifle cracked, and I ducked instinctively, my breath catching in my throat. The jungle was a maze, every tree and vine looking the same, but João seemed to know where he was going.“Over here!” he said, pulling me toward a shallow stream. The water was cold, tugging at my ankles as we splashed through. I glanced back, seeing shadows moving through the trees. My lungs burned, but I kept running, driven by the fear of what would happen if they caught us.Joao veered toward a rocky outcrop, a small cave barely visible in its shadow. “In there,” he said, pushing me inside. The cave was damp and narrow, the walls slick with moss. We pressed ourselves against the stone, our breaths loud in the dark. Outside, the men’s voices grew closer.“Where’d they go?” one growled, his voice rough with anger.“Check the stream,” another said. “They can’t be far.”I clamped a hand over my mouth, trying to silence my gasps. João’s hand found mine, squeezing hard, his eyes glinting in the faint light. The crunch of boots on leaves passed by, so close I could smell cigarette smoke. My heart felt like it would burst. Minutes dragged on, each one endless, until the voices faded.“We can’t stay,” João whispered. “They’ll come back.”We crept out, my legs trembling so badly I could barely stand. The jungle felt different now, every shadow a threat, every snap of a twig a footstep. João led us toward a river, its water dark and rippling. In the distance, I saw pink dolphins arching through the surface, their grace at odds with the terror in my chest.“We can’t go back the way we came,” João said, scanning the bank. “We’ll build a raft. It’s our only way out.”We gathered fallen logs, my hands scratched and bleeding as we tied them with vines. João worked fast, his movements sure, but his eyes kept darting to the trees. “The river’s dangerous,” he said. “Strong currents, caimans. But we have no choice.”We dragged the raft to the water, its weight making my arms ache. Climbing on, I gripped the edges as the current took hold, pulling us faster than I expected. The raft wobbled, water sloshing over my feet. I tried to focus on the river ahead, but the jungle’s sounds followed us—hoots, screeches, the rustle of unseen things.“Look out!” João shouted, pointing to a dark shape in the water. A caiman, its eyes like polished stones, glided toward us. My stomach lurched as it lunged, jaws snapping inches from the raft. João swung his paddle, splashing water, but the creature didn’t back off. The raft rocked violently, and I screamed, clutching a log to keep from falling in.“Hit it!” João yelled, striking again. The caiman thrashed, its tail slamming the water, and the raft spun. We hit a rock, the impact jarring my bones. Wood splintered, and the raft started to break apart, vines unraveling.“Swim!” João shouted as the current pulled us under. I clung to a piece of the raft, kicking toward the bank, my heart pounding. The water was murky, hiding what might be below. I imagined those jaws closing around my leg, and panic clawed at me. João was beside me, his strokes strong, urging me on.We reached the shore, collapsing in the mud, gasping for air. My clothes were soaked, my body shaking from cold and fear. João pulled me to my feet. “We’re not safe yet,” he said, his voice urgent. “They could still be looking.”We stumbled through the jungle, following the river’s edge. My shoes squelched with every step, and my skin itched from insect bites. Hours later, as the light began to fade, we reached a fishing village. Small houses on stilts lined the river, and a family took us in, their faces kind but worried. The mother, Ana, wrapped us in blankets and gave us hot tea.“You’re lucky to be alive,” she said, her voice soft. “The jungle doesn’t forgive.”They had an old radio, and we contacted the authorities. I used their ancient computer to send my photos to my editor, my hands still shaking as I typed. João sat beside me, silent, his eyes on the river outside.Days later, in Manaus, I learned my story had made waves. The photos led to raids, and some of the loggers were arrested. The authorities were still searching for others. As I boarded my plane home, Maria’s words echoed in my head: “The forest protects its secrets.” I’d escaped with my life, but the jungle’s shadows clung to me. The hum of its sounds, the glint of caiman eyes, the crack of that rifle—they’d stay with me forever, a reminder of how close I’d come to being one of the Amazon’s lost.

  


# ""The Silent Stretch"":

I’m deep in the Amazon Rainforest, part of a small research team studying rare medicinal plants. There are four of us: me, a botanist with a knack for spotting patterns in leaves; Clara, my colleague who can identify a plant just by its smell; Diego, our local guide who grew up on the edge of the jungle and knows its paths like his own hands; and Emma, a quiet photographer with an eye for detail, capturing our work for a university grant. We’ve been hiking for six days, cutting through dense vines, wading across shallow streams, and dodging roots that twist out of the muddy ground like fingers. My boots are caked with dirt, my shirt sticks to my skin, and my backpack straps dig into my shoulders. The jungle hums with life—cicadas screeching, birds calling, something always rustling in the undergrowth.It started three days ago. We’d set up camp near a narrow river, its water dark and sluggish. Diego picked the spot, saying it was a good place to rest, with flat ground and a break in the canopy overhead. Clara was thrilled, kneeling in the mud to examine a cluster of small, red flowers with spiky petals. “These are new,” she said, her voice bright with excitement. “I’ve never seen anything like them. Could be a breakthrough for painkillers.” She pulled out her notebook, sketching the petals with quick, precise strokes. Emma crouched nearby, her camera clicking as she captured the flowers from every angle, the lens glinting in the dim light. Diego, though, was quieter than usual. He stood at the edge of camp, machete in hand, staring into the trees.“You okay?” I asked, brushing dirt off my hands as I walked over.He didn’t look at me. “This place… it’s called the silent stretch by the locals. People don’t come here.”I frowned, glancing at the dense wall of green around us. “Why not?”“People disappear,” he said, his voice low. “Loggers, hunters, even researchers like you. They go in, they don’t come out. My uncle used to tell stories about it.”Clara overheard and laughed, standing up with her notebook in hand. “Sounds like something you tell kids to keep them out of trouble. We’re fine, Diego. We’ve got you, right?”He forced a smile, but his eyes stayed on the trees. “Just stay close,” he said. “Don’t wander.”I felt a prickle of unease but brushed it off. Diego was cautious, that was all. He’d guided us through tougher spots than this. Still, as we cooked dinner over a small fire, the jungle seemed to press in closer. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves. Frogs croaked, and somewhere far off, a monkey screeched. Emma kept glancing over her shoulder, her fingers tight on her camera strap.“What’s wrong?” I asked her, spooning beans from a can.She hesitated, then whispered, “I heard something last night. Like… footsteps. Heavy ones. Circling the camp.”Clara rolled her eyes, tossing a stick into the fire. “It’s the jungle, Emma. Probably a deer or a tapir. You’re jumping at shadows.”“Not here,” Diego said, his voice sharp. He was sitting on a log, sharpening his machete with slow, deliberate strokes. “Animals don’t come to this part of the forest. It’s too quiet.”I listened. He was right. The usual chatter of birds and insects was muted, like the jungle was holding its breath. My skin prickled. “Maybe we should move camp tomorrow,” I said.Diego nodded. “Good idea.”We agreed to take watch shifts that night. I couldn’t sleep during mine. Every rustle made my heart jump. The fire had died to embers, and the darkness felt alive, heavy with unseen eyes. I gripped my flashlight, scanning the trees, but saw nothing. By morning, we were all on edge, our faces pale and drawn. Clara tried to lighten the mood, joking about naming the red flowers after herself, but even she sounded forced.Then we found the tracks.They were near the river, pressed deep into the mud where we’d filled our canteens. Human footprints, but too large, the toes splayed wide like whoever made them was barefoot. They trailed from the water into the trees, disappearing into the undergrowth. Diego crouched beside them, his face grim. “These are fresh,” he said. “Last night, maybe.”“Another team?” Clara asked, but her voice shook. She clutched her notebook like a shield.Diego shook his head. “No one comes here. Not researchers, not locals. No one.”Emma’s hands trembled as she aimed her camera at the prints. “I told you I heard footsteps,” she whispered.My stomach twisted. “What do we do?” I asked.“We pack up,” Diego said. “We leave. Now.”We broke camp in a rush, stuffing gear into our packs with shaking hands. The jungle was quieter than ever, the air thick and still. As we hiked, I kept looking back, expecting to see someone—or something—behind us. The trees were so dense, their leaves blocking out most of the light, turning the path into a tunnel of green. Every snapped twig, every rustle, made my pulse race.By midday, we reached a small clearing. Diego stopped so suddenly I nearly bumped into him. “What is it?” I whispered.He pointed to a tree ahead. Carved into the bark was a rough symbol—an X with a diagonal slash through it. The cuts were fresh, the wood beneath still pale. “That’s a marker,” Diego said, his voice barely audible. “Poachers. Or smugglers. They use this area to move things—drugs, animals, whatever. They mark their paths.”Clara’s face went pale. “You knew about this and didn’t tell us?”“I didn’t think they’d be this close,” Diego snapped, his eyes scanning the trees. “We’re too deep. We need to turn back.”Emma clutched her camera, her knuckles white. “What if they’re watching us?”Before anyone could answer, a sharp whistle cut through the air. It came from the trees to our left, high and piercing. A second whistle answered from the right. My heart slammed against my ribs. “What was that?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.Diego’s face was tight. “They’re signaling. They know we’re here.”“Run?” Emma asked, her voice breaking.“No,” Diego said. “Running makes you prey. Stay calm. Follow me, single file.”We moved slowly, sticking close. The whistles kept coming, closer now, echoing through the trees. I heard branches snap, heavy steps pacing us in the shadows. My mouth was dry, my legs shaky. Clara grabbed my arm, her nails digging in. “This is bad,” she whispered. “This is really bad.”“Keep moving,” Diego hissed. He led us toward a ravine, its steep walls covered in vines. “If we can get across, we might lose them.”But as we reached the ravine’s edge, a man stepped out from the trees. He was tall, his clothes dirty and patched, a machete hanging from his belt. His face was weathered, his eyes cold and unblinking. Two more men appeared behind him, one holding a rifle, the other a long knife. Their clothes were mismatched, their faces hard. They moved like they owned the jungle.“Stop,” the first man said, his English rough but clear. “You’re in the wrong place.”Diego raised his hands slowly, gesturing for us to do the same. “We’re researchers,” he said. “Studying plants. We don’t want trouble.”The man smirked, stepping closer. His machete swung lightly at his side. “Researchers,” he said, spitting the word like it tasted bad. “Always poking around. You saw the marker. You know too much.”My heart pounded so hard I thought it would burst. “Please,” I said, my voice shaking. “We’ll leave. We won’t tell anyone.”The man’s eyes locked on mine, and I felt a chill. “Too late,” he said. He nodded to the man with the rifle, who raised it, the barrel glinting. Emma whimpered, clutching her camera. Clara was frozen, her breathing fast and shallow.Diego spoke in Spanish, his voice calm but urgent. I caught a few words—please, mistake, leave. The leader laughed, a harsh, grating sound. “You think you can talk your way out?” he said. “This is our jungle. You don’t belong here.”The man with the knife stepped toward Emma, eyeing her camera. “What’s that?” he growled. Before anyone could stop her, Emma raised it and snapped a photo, the flash lighting up the clearing like a lightning strike. The leader’s face twisted with rage. “You stupid—” He lunged, yanking the camera from her hands and smashing it against a rock. The lens shattered, and Emma screamed, stumbling back.“Stop!” I shouted, stepping forward without thinking. The rifle swung toward me, and I froze, hands up, my whole body shaking. “We’ll go. We don’t want anything. Please.”The leader stared at me, his eyes narrowing. For a moment, I was sure he’d swing that machete. Then he stepped back, smirking. “Run,” he said. “But if we see you again, you’re dead. All of you.”Diego grabbed my arm. “Move. Now.”We stumbled back, half-running, half-tripping through the jungle. The whistles followed us, sharp and mocking, fading in and out. My lungs burned, my legs ached, but we didn’t stop. The trees seemed to close in, branches snagging my clothes like hands. Clara was crying, muttering, “We shouldn’t have come here.” Emma clutched the strap of her broken camera, her face pale. Diego kept us moving, his machete out, slashing through vines.We reached the river by nightfall and camped without a fire, too scared to draw attention. We took turns keeping watch, but I couldn’t sleep. Every sound—every leaf rustling, every twig snapping—made me jump. The jungle felt alive, watching, waiting. I kept seeing the leader’s cold eyes, the glint of his machete. Were they following us? Toying with us?At dawn, Diego checked the map. “The nearest village is a day away,” he said, his voice hoarse. “We move fast, we might make it.”“Might?” Clara snapped, her eyes red. “Those men could be anywhere!”“We don’t have a choice,” Diego said. “Stay here, we die.”We pushed on, exhaustion weighing us down. The jungle was relentless—mud sucking at our boots, insects biting our skin, vines tangling our feet. By afternoon, the whistles had stopped, but the silence was worse. It felt like the calm before a storm. Emma barely spoke, her hands shaking every time she touched her broken camera. Clara kept muttering about the flowers, how they weren’t worth this. I just wanted to get out.We reached the village at dusk, a cluster of wooden huts on the jungle’s edge. The locals took us in, gave us food and water, but their faces were grim when we told them what happened. An old woman shook her head. “The silent stretch,” she said. “You’re lucky to be alive. Many aren’t.”She told us stories—loggers who vanished, hunters found dead with no wounds, researchers like us who never returned. Smugglers, she said, ruled that part of the jungle, moving drugs or rare animals, killing anyone who crossed their path. The carved markers were their warnings, and we’d ignored them.We left the next morning, piling into a rickety boat that took us downriver. I kept looking back, half-expecting to see those men in the trees. I never went back to the Amazon. I still dream about it, though—the whistles, the footprints, the leader’s cold smirk. Sometimes I wake up thinking I hear those footsteps again, circling in the dark, and I wonder if they’re still out there, waiting for someone else to stumble into their jungle.

  


# ""Chased Through the Green Hell: My Near-Death Trek in the Amazon, 1981"":

I was 22, an Israeli backpacker chasing adventure in the Amazon Rainforest in 1981. My friends, Kevin and Marcus, were with me, drawn by stories of untouched jungles and hidden villages. We hired Karl, a local guide with a weathered face and sharp eyes, to lead us to a remote settlement deep in the Bolivian Amazon. His quiet confidence reassured us, but something about the way he scanned the trees made my stomach twist. I brushed it off as nerves.We set out at dawn, our backpacks loaded with food, water, and camping gear. The jungle swallowed us quickly, its canopy blocking out the sky, leaving only slivers of light to guide us. The air was thick with the hum of insects, the sharp cries of birds, and the rustle of leaves. Karl moved ahead, his machete slicing through vines with rhythmic chops. Kevin, always the optimist, tried to keep things light. “Bet we’ll spot a jaguar,” he said, nudging me with a grin.“Don’t jinx us,” I replied, forcing a smile. My eyes darted to the shadows, where every flicker felt like a warning.Marcus trailed behind, clutching his map like a lifeline. “Karl, how far’s this village?” he called, wiping sweat from his brow.“Three days, maybe four,” Karl answered without turning. “Stay close. Jungle’s tricky.”That first day was grueling. My boots sank into the muddy earth, and thorny branches scratched my arms, leaving red welts. By nightfall, we reached a small clearing by a stream, its water murky but cool. We set up our tents, and Kevin started a fire, the crackling flames a small comfort against the jungle’s endless noise. I lay in my sleeping bag, exhausted but restless, the distant howl of a monkey keeping me on edge. Around midnight, a rustling near my tent snapped me awake. My heart pounded. “Kevin? Marcus?” I whispered, gripping my flashlight.Silence. I unzipped the tent, the sound loud in the quiet. My flashlight beam caught Karl standing at the camp’s edge, staring into the dark, his machete glinting in his hand. “What’s wrong?” I asked, my voice barely steady.“Nothing,” he said, too fast, his eyes not meeting mine. “Go sleep.”I didn’t believe him. His knuckles were white around the machete’s handle. I crawled back into my tent, my mind racing, imagining predators or worse lurking just beyond the firelight.The next morning, Karl was different—tense, his movements sharp. He barely spoke as we packed up and pushed deeper into the jungle. The trees grew denser, the air heavier, like the forest was closing in. Around noon, he stopped abruptly, crouching to study the ground. I peered over his shoulder and saw footprints—not ours, too large, too deep. “Karl, what is it?” I asked, my voice low.He stood, scanning the trees. “We’re being followed,” he muttered. “Keep moving.”My stomach dropped. “Followed by who?” I pressed, but he just shook his head and started walking again.Marcus overheard, his face paling. “What’s he mean, followed?” he asked me, his voice tight.“I don’t know,” I said, glancing back. The jungle felt alive, watching us. Kevin tried to laugh it off. “Probably just some curious locals, right?” But his eyes betrayed his worry.That evening, Karl stopped us in a small clearing, barely big enough for our tents. “No fire tonight,” he said, his tone final.“No fire?” Marcus protested, dropping his pack. “Why not? It’s freezing!”“Too dangerous,” Karl said, his eyes flicking to the trees. “Trust me.”I didn’t trust him anymore. His secrecy was gnawing at me. After dinner—cold rations of bread and dried fruit—I noticed Karl slip into the jungle alone. My gut told me to follow. I grabbed my knife, a small folding blade I kept for emergencies, and trailed him, moving quietly through the undergrowth. My heart thudded so loud I was sure he’d hear it.He stopped by a massive tree, kneeling to examine more footprints, fresh and clear in the mud. They weren’t animal tracks—too human, too deliberate. My throat tightened. I stepped out, unable to stay quiet. “Karl, what’s going on?” I demanded, my voice shaking.He flinched, standing fast. “You shouldn’t be here,” he hissed. “Go back.”“Not until you tell me the truth,” I said, gripping my knife. “Who’s following us?”He hesitated, then leaned closer, his voice a whisper. “Bandits. They’ve been on our trail since yesterday. They want our gear, our money. Maybe worse.”The word “bandits” hit like a punch. I’d heard stories in La Paz—travelers robbed, beaten, or left for dead in the Amazon’s depths. “Why didn’t you tell us?” I asked, my voice rising.“Didn’t want panic,” he said, looking away. “I thought I could lose them. We keep moving, we’ll reach the village.”I wanted to scream, but fear kept me quiet. Back at camp, I told Kevin and Marcus everything. Kevin’s face hardened. “He should’ve told us,” he said, clenching his fists. Marcus just stared at the ground, his hands trembling.That night, I barely slept. Every snap of a twig, every rustle, felt like the bandits closing in. My knife stayed in my hand, its cold metal a small comfort. At dawn, Karl woke us, his face grim. “We move now. Fast.”We pushed through the jungle, faster than before. My legs burned, my backpack digging into my shoulders. The air was thick with tension, the jungle’s sounds now a threat. I kept looking back, expecting to see figures in the shadows. Then, around midday, I saw it—a flash of movement, a figure darting behind a tree. My breath caught. “Karl!” I whispered, grabbing his arm. “Someone’s there.”He froze, raising a hand for silence. We stood still, the jungle quiet except for our ragged breathing. Then, a shout—a man’s voice, harsh and unfamiliar, echoing through the trees. Karl’s face went pale. “Run,” he said.We bolted, crashing through vines and roots. My heart pounded, my lungs screaming as I stumbled over the uneven ground. Behind us, footsteps thudded, heavy and relentless. I glanced back and saw three men, their faces hard, machetes gleaming in their hands. One had a scar across his cheek, his eyes locked on us.“Keep going!” Karl shouted, pulling me forward. We reached a river, its current fast and muddy, rocks slick underfoot. “Cross it!” he ordered.The water was cold, pulling at my legs. I slipped, my knee slamming into a rock, pain shooting through me. Marcus grabbed my arm, his face pale. “Stay with me,” he said, his voice shaking. We scrambled across, the water up to our thighs, and climbed the muddy bank on the other side.The bandits were close now, their shouts louder, taunting. Karl turned, machete raised. “Stay back!” he yelled. “We don’t want trouble!”The scarred man stepped forward, his smile cold. “Drop your bags,” he said, his English broken but clear. “No one gets hurt.”Kevin clutched his pack, shaking his head. “We need this stuff,” he said, his voice cracking. “You can’t just—”“Your choice,” the scarred man cut in, raising his machete. The other two fanned out, blocking our path.My heart stopped. We were trapped, outnumbered. My knife felt useless in my hand. I looked at Karl, hoping for a plan, but his face was tight with fear. Then, a new sound—shouts from deeper in the jungle, sharp and commanding. The bandits froze, their heads snapping toward the noise.A group of men burst through the trees, locals from the village we’d been heading to. They carried bows and spears, their faces stern. Their leader, a short man with weathered skin and kind eyes, shouted in Spanish, pointing at the bandits. The scarred man hesitated, then spat on the ground and signaled his men to retreat. They melted into the jungle, gone as fast as they’d appeared.The leader approached, speaking rapidly to Karl. I caught fragments—words like “peligroso” and “bandidos.” Karl nodded, his shoulders sagging with relief. “They’ll take us to the village,” he told us, his voice hoarse.We followed the hunters, my legs shaking from adrenaline and exhaustion. The village was a cluster of wooden huts, smoke rising from cooking fires. They gave us food—rice, fish, and bananas—and a hut to rest in. I sat with Kevin and Marcus, my hands still trembling as I ate.“We could’ve died,” Marcus said, staring at his plate, his voice barely a whisper.“But we didn’t,” Kevin said, though his usual bravado was gone, his face pale.I looked at Karl, sitting alone by the fire, his eyes distant. I walked over, my anger bubbling up. “You knew about the bandits,” I said, keeping my voice low. “Why didn’t you warn us from the start?”He met my gaze, his expression heavy. “I thought I could handle it,” he said. “I’ve dealt with them before. Didn’t want you to turn back.”“You almost got us killed,” I said, my voice shaking. “We deserved to know.”He nodded slowly. “I was wrong,” he said, and for the first time, I saw guilt in his eyes.We stayed in the village for three days, recovering. The locals told us stories of bandits who roamed the jungle, preying on travelers, stealing everything from gear to lives. Some groups, they said, were never seen again, their fates swallowed by the forest. I realized how close we’d come to being one of those stories.When we finally left the Amazon, guided by the villagers to a riverboat, I felt like I’d aged a decade. The jungle was beautiful, its rivers and trees unlike anything I’d ever seen, but its shadows hid dangers I’d never forget. I looked back at the green wall of trees as we sailed away, my heart heavy with relief and fear. I never returned.",1,1749210315.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Recently I made a new friend who is an expat and me and him kicked it off. After meeting here and there, I introduced him to some of my friends and girlfriend as he's new in town and thought it would be nice to finally have another male friend (had only another male friend apart from him). 

However, based on the first interaction I could tell my girlfriend didn't like him for certain reasons. The first one was because he says things that come across wrong when he doesn't intend it. For example, when asking my girlfriend where she works, she works in the gym and he automatically assumed as an assistant than a personal trainer which she is. She got quite annoyed about this assumption which I understand why.

When we were also talking, my girlfriend dropped her phone and as a joke he tried to say ""iPhone gone"". Lastly another one was when my girlfriend was talking about how she loves drinking coffee and he tried to make another joke (can't remember) but my girlfriend didn't like it either.

I am unsure what to do because my other friends who I introduced have started to make effort to bring my new friend to join. I'm just worried of issues arising incase something he says and my girlfriend doesn't like it hence there being problems in the group.

Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid? Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining. I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap. The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn. Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future . That was before everything fell apart. My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect. But everything changed the night of the setup. I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it…""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia… before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing—again.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest—not out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them—Levi, Louis, and Lennox—looked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One… two…"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father—a stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.

Shobha and Chandni were never meant to meet like this.

One grieving. One abandoned. One holding onto whatever scraps of dignity she had left. The other trying to look whole while quietly falling apart.

They meet at a book reading. Some poet is going on about heartbreak and destiny. Shobha is there on behalf of her magazine, Chandni is there because her husband is speaking at the academic panel next door. They sit next to each other. Chandni's hair is too perfect. Shobha’s face looks like she hasn’t slept in days. They exchange tired smiles. Pretend to listen.

Chandni says she loves Shobha’s bag. Shobha says she loves Chandni’s courage for asking a question out loud. They get coffee. Then lunch. Then long walks in Lodhi Garden. Then long silences that don’t feel awkward anymore.

Amit thinks he’s clever. Thinks he can keep the both of them tied to him through guilt and memory and poetry. But Chandni has stopped reading his poems. She’s started writing her own. Shobha edits them.

There’s one night. It's raining. Chandni’s stuck at Shobha’s place. The city is flooded, phones are dead. Shobha lights candles. Chandni changes into one of her kurtas. They sit on the floor, eating Maggi from the same bowl, knees bumping.

Shobha says, “I think I’ve spent my whole life trying to be good.”

Chandni looks at her and says, “Maybe we deserve to be happy instead.”

That’s the moment. It’s not loud. It’s not cinematic. But it shifts everything.

They don’t tell anyone. Not for a while. Not because they’re ashamed, but because they want to protect it. Nurture it. Let it breathe.

Amit writes Chandni another letter. She doesn’t respond. He sends flowers. Shobha throws them out.

Eventually, they leave. Delhi becomes too small, too nosy. They move to Ranikhet. Start a homestay. Grow their own vegetables. Run writing workshops. Publish a feminist magazine. Watch old black-and-white movies on a projector they bought from Chandni’s cousin.

Sometimes guests ask how they met. Shobha laughs and says, “We were both in love with the same man.”

Chandni smiles and adds, “Then we fell in love with each other.”

Amit writes one last poem. It’s not about them. It’s about a bird that flew away and never came back.

He keeps the page folded in his wallet.

He never reads it out loud.",3,1749209706.0,AskIndianWomen,4,1.0,False

I know I shouldn't be this upset, but I don't know why this situation bothers me so much. Maybe because via silent treatment and plain indifference my parents finally made clear the worth we have to them. I know I should leverage this situation because I don't have to deal with craziness, but silence is also a bitch.

This is my situation: I've been NC with my nmom for a few years and LC with my edad. In the town I live they have a summer house that it is close from my home (10 min walk). Due to the proximity, it is inevitable to bump into them, so when it happens, we are civil and usually have trivial conversations. They say hello to their granddaughter and that's all. No arguments at all.

Well, they came in april to stay a few weeks, and when my edad called to wish me a happy birthday I told him that he could come by to have a coffee and see his granddaughter. He literally told me that he would, because he had some clothes a friend of the family gifted to my kid. 

Well, 2 months have passed and I haven't seen or heard from him. And today my sister tells me that they came back to their main home because they had to watch my nephew. And that's it. No visit or communication from my edad, no coffee, nothing.

I've thinking about the situation and I'm sure that this is some sort of manipulation from my nmom. I'm sure they are convinced that I must be the one visiting, calling and making the effort (my job, errands, kid and life are secondary). And of course, I must be the bigger person, forget all the cruel shit I had to endure for 5 years and rush to their house. 

I can imagine her words, because she has done this before: ""If she wants the clothes, she can come for them herself. If not, we will throw them to the bin. You (for my edad) won't set a foot in her house, she is the one who must visit us"".

So message received loud and clear: It is your way or the highway. They don't care about us and their love is completely conditional. We have the worth of a piece of trash.

**Next Issue >** Coming July 2025

&nbsp;

There were very few times in the Oblivion Bar’s history that they had turned customers away. Now with the souls of the Shadowlands committed to remaining, the bar was never without someone signed onto the Shadowpact to work the taps. After the team’s [extended vacation with Destruction](/r/DCNext/comments/1b99ax4/shadowpact_11_surprise_witness/), Kid Crusader had commented that they hadn’t even realised they were gone. The bar continued as normal.

But with Inza’s sudden appearance, coupled with her insistence on the sensitivity of her news, the bartenders thought it best to close up early.

“I don’t even wanna pretend to know how long it’s been since I last saw you, Inza,” Traci remarked, leaning backwards onto the bar. “You look good.”

Inza smiled slightly, but it was Wotan who spoke first. “The Shadowpact, in the flesh. Long-time fan.”

Five sets of eyes all fell on Wotan at the same time with varying amounts of confusion and wonderment. Her green skin shone almost yellow under the dim warm light of the ceiling light, the edges of her mouth curled up into more of a sneer than a smile. Her eyes fell on Rory, whose attire she recognised. “Ah, you must be Ragman’s kid. I heard about you showing my guys who’s boss. More power to you. It’s about time someone pissed them off.”

Rory was taken aback for a moment by Wotan’s forwardness, surprised that an apparent Lord of Chaos not only remembered his actions, but agreed with them. “I don’t believe we’ve met,” was all he could say, addressing all three new faces.

“Oh, pardon me. I’m Inza. This is my nephew, Khalid.” She gestured to Khalid who bowed his head slightly upon hearing his name. “And—”

“Wotan. Pleasure to meet you all.” She offered a hand to the crowd. A beat of silence passed. Then, sprouting from the group like a branch from a tree, Ruin’s hand grabbed Wotan’s and shook it enthusiastically.

Traci turned to her fellow colleagues, pointing and naming them one by one. “Jim. Rory. Sherry. Ruin.” And finally, she pointed to herself. “Traci.”

“Now that we’re all acquainted,” Khalid said, clasping his hands together. “I believe we should let them know why we asked them to close their place of business for the day.”

“Definitely,” Inza agreed with a nod. She looked up at each member of the Shadowpact, her eyes glossy. The incandescent bulb high above them buzzed and hummed softly. “As you know, Traci, we are connected—” She grimaced. “We *were* connected to Nabu, Lord of Order. You may also know that he can be…”

“A dick?” Wotan offered, looking down at her nails.

“Ruthless,” Inza sighed. “Stubborn. Petty. An asshole of the highest Order, honestly.”

“Yeah, sounds pretty standard.” Traci hopped up onto the bar and leaned forwards, her arms on her knees. Her face was stern, focused - concerned. “But, wait, hold on - you got cut off from Nabu? And you’re working with this…” Traci glared at Wotan, who waved her fingers at her in response. “... Chaos Lord?”

“These are dire times, which call for dire methods” said Khalid. “Yes, it’s clear the Lords of Order pride themselves on appearing powerful rather than benevolent. And the Lords of Chaos are no better. I’m sure you didn’t have the greatest experience of them when you visited them.”

Jim shook his head. “Not at all. They were… demanding, arrogant, selfish.”

“Point being,” Wotan said, arms raised. “Neither party is what you’d call the pinnacle of leadership. I’ll put it plainly: both sides suck at their jobs. Their whole schtick is keeping balance, making sure that one of them doesn’t win more than the other. But because they’re in stasis - because they’re both refusing to step out of their cozy little comfort zones to stop the other - all it’s doing is harm.” Wotan fell into a lounge chair with a huff. “Doesn’t even benefit themselves.”

“And to make matters worse,” continued Inza, her face flushed with rage. “It isn’t just ineptitude that is causing this, it’s knowing inaction. They each refuse to perform the very basics of their purpose: stopping the other - for the sake of self-preservation, or even simply self-image.”

“So, if I’m understanding y’all correctly, these two groups of Lords created precise guidelines to follow, then ignored all of their own guidelines just to make themselves look good, rather than do good?” Sherry summarised.

Wotan grinned. “Got it in one.”

“So, what do you need us to do?” Rory folded his arms. “I mean, I’m not exactly rubbing elbows with the Lords of Chaos right now, and from the sounds of it you’re not on great terms with your Lord of Order, either.”

“Far from it,” Khalid shook his head gravely. “We suspect he could sense our potential desire to—”

“Ah, ah, ah, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Wotan teased. “Well, my rag-wearing friend, what we need from you is much easier said than done - and believe me, it’s not that easy to say.”

“Which is?” Traci asked, betraying her impatience.

“Help us to tear down both systems entirely. Wipe the slate clean. Build something else.”

There was a pause. Jim and Ruin had scarcely a grasp on the concept of Lords of Order and Chaos, and so for them, the idea of destroying them entirely was only just as alien as anything else they had ever encountered. Sherry and Rory each wrestled with the idea in their heads; the words hung heavy in their minds as they weighed up whether they could justify performing such an earth-shattering feat. And Traci, who considered the idea for only a moment, suddenly nodded. “Deal.”

Immediately, Jim craned his neck to look at her. “Wh—? Traci!”

“What?” She asked incredulously. “Oh, come on, Jim, don’t be like that.”

“Do you understand the weight of what they're asking of us?” Rory asked with a hushed tone.

“Do *you?* We’ve fought angels, for God’s sake - and won! Tearing shit down and trying our best to make it better is kind of our whole deal.”

“Three angels. We fought three angels. Barely. I can’t even imagine how many Lords there are.”

“I counted more than three,” mumbled Ruin with a nod.

Sherry tilted her head at Rory. “I do get what she’s saying. I don’t think it’s too out of the realm of possibility for us.”

“But what about—?”

“We have to consider—”

“Traci, I don’t think—”

The quintet’s conversation slowly unravelling, Wotan took her opportunity to grab their attention once more. “Alright, alright, jeez!” she shouted. “Look, I know the odds look bad. Eight versus…” Wotan began to count, her fingers flexing and relaxing as she tried her best to calculate, but eventually she waved her hands dismissively. “...a lot. But it doesn’t have to be just eight. There are hundreds - thousands, maybe - of magicians and sorcerers and witches and whatever else you call yourselves out there. If we manage to round a bunch of them up…” Wotan scoffed. “It’d almost be too easy.”

“And what if they say no?” asked Jim. “I mean, not everyone is going to jump at the chance to risk their lives for the sake of a changing of the guard.”

“The way I see it, both parties are failing at their jobs,” Wotan huffed. “The world is too regimented and by-the-book, and at the same is anarchic. Anything would be better than where we currently are.”

Traci opened her mouth to respond but thought better of it. Instead, she turned to her colleagues, who each looked back at her. Sherry gave her a soft nod; Ruin, a grin forming on their face, shot her a thumbs up; Jim shot a glance at Rory; and Rory, furrowing his brow, finally said, “I’m willing to entertain it.”

“Admittedly,” Inza piped up. “There is a slight wrinkle in this plan. Being severed from Nabu could be an omen of things to come. He does not exactly treat his defectors lightly. All this to say, we may be in a time crunch.”

“Then we should split up,” Jim decided. “I mean, do you know any magical contacts you could get a hold of?”

“Some,” Wotan answered.

“As do we,” Traci nodded. “Ask anyone and everyone we can think of, then let’s report back here.”

It had been many years since Loretta York had dreamed of saving the world. Despite what her parents would describe as ‘turbulent teenage years’, she felt as though she had done relatively well for herself. Over a year out of prison, a semi-stable part-time job, a place with cheap rent far enough away from her parents - while it wasn’t the life she had dreamed of as a child, it was hers.

She pondered this as she stared down into her morning cup of coffee, the aroma wafting up from the swirling vortex of brown liquid inside the mug. She inhaled the scent deeply as she raised the cup to her mouth. She tilted the cup towards her to take a sip—

“Hey, Loretta.”

Loretta flinched hard. The cup luckily remained in her hands, but a few drops of the scalding liquid were not so lucky, plinking on the ground at her feet. She looked up at the source of the voice and as she did so, her heart dropped. It wasn’t every day that one bumped into a slender woman in her mid-20s with emerald skin, and so recognition flashed across her face. “It’s you.”

Wotan smirked and thrusted her hands out to the sides as if to say ‘here I am’.

“From the bus,” Loretta continued, her hands shaking as she placed the mug down on the counter. “I was— I was going to prison, and…”

“I remember it like it was yesterday,” sighed Wotan wistfully. She clasped her hands together and held them to her cheek.

“How did you…?”

Wotan shook her head. Her eyes fell on a bowl of fruit on the table beside her, and she leaned over to grab a small round fruit that she estimated to be a plum. “Believe me, it is so much easier the fewer questions you ask.”

“What… what do you want from me?”

Wotan’s teeth tore through the flesh of the fruit and revealed the sweet pulp inside. She hummed in response. “Now, that,” she mumbled, her mouth full. “That’s a question I actually can answer.” Wotan held up a single finger as she chewed, chewed, chewed, then swallowed the chunk of plum in her mouth. “I won’t beat around the bush. There is going to be a giant magical deposition, overthrowing two major players in the goings-on of magic, and we’re going to need some badass magic users to help lead the charge.”

Loretta stared at the verdant woman with fear. “And you picked me?”

“Not much more badass than trying to blow up a building with fireworks, huh?” She raised the fruit to her mouth once more before pulling it away again to add, “Oh, that and all your magic book stuff.”

“I can’t. I… I don’t even know where the book is. And even if I did, I don’t know if I’m the right fit to overthrow some big magical power.”

Wotan’s facade faltered. Her grin started to shrink into barely a smirk, her body relaxed. She took a step towards the young woman. “Look. I know you and I aren’t exactly besties. But I do remember what you said to me about why you did what you did. About your parents, their expectations of you. You always thought all the bad things that happened were because of you, you said it felt like all the magic was gone in the world, that you just wanted to do some good and prove that it wasn’t your generation’s fault.” She leaned in. “What if I told you that there are so many people who feel the way that you felt then? And what if I told you it could all stop if you join us?”

Loretta shook her head vigorously. “No. I told you, I don’t even have the book. I’m sorry, I… you’re right, I know this could do good. There’s just nothing I can do.”

Wotan stared at her. With a glance up and down and a final bite of her plum, the green-skinned woman sighed. “Well, it was worth a try.” She turned on her heel to leave, but before she did, she turned back to Loretta. “But if I find out that you kept that book…” She pointed an accusatory finger at her and widened her eyes.

As Wotan departed, Loretta felt the air in her lungs escaping. Her chest hurt and her stomach ached. Once she was certain her uninvited visitor had left, she allowed her eyes to wander over to the hatch above her head, a pull cord attached to it: her attic. As her eyes fixed on the dangling string, swaying back and forth like a hangman’s noose, she pursed her lips. She wasn’t ready to go back to that old life. At least, not yet.

“Your Highness, may I present to you, Miss Traci Thirteen of the Oblivion Bar.”

The towering ebony doors shrieked as they slowly edged open. The throne room before Traci was ornate yet understated; the lush burgundy wooden flooring under her feet was decorated by only a single rug at the foot of the throne. A strikingly realistic portrait hung directly above the throne depicting the Queen holding a sprig of small lilac flowers, a long purple robe hanging from her shoulders. Her Majesty herself was perched on the large throne and, as Traci entered the room, she rose gracefully from her seat and smiled.

“Traci,” she greeted. “We meet again.”

“Thanks for agreeing to meet with me, Your Highness.” Remembering the young woman’s words to her months ago, she shot a side glance at her various guards dotted around the room before correcting herself - “Eve.”

With a single nod, Eve chuckled softly. “What was it that you wanted to speak to me about?”

“Well,” Traci began, somewhat uncertain of how she would broach the question with her. There was a strange awkwardness that came over her as she stood in the centre of the room; the ceiling high above her and the motionless guards stationed at every exit left her feeling exposed, vulnerable. Watched. “After we helped you against that creature in the Shadowlands, you said that you were preparing for ‘what’s to come’.”

“That’s correct.”

“Has anything come of that?”

The monarch lowered herself back into her seat, inhaling deeply. “Not yet,” she admitted. “And the more time that passes with no signs, the more I despair about the unknown of it all. What’s going to happen to my kingdom, my people? Are we ready for what’s in store?”

Traci nodded solemnly. “I get it. I really do. The reason I ask - and I apologise in advance for adding to your already huge list of worries - is that if these premonitions are true, if these creatures appearing can really predict the future, then I may have an inkling as to what it’s predicted.”

“Is that so?” Eve sat forward with surprise. “Oh, Traci, it’s very kind of you to let me know.”

Traci winced. “I wouldn’t call me kind until you hear what I have to say.”

“Then please, continue.”

“I’m not sure how aware you are of the Lords of Chaos and Order.” The blank expression on the Queen’s face told Traci everything she needed to know. “To boil it down, these two very powerful warring factions are not pulling their weight at all, and it’s causing a hell of a lot of fallout on everyone, themselves included.” Traci spoke carefully, an intentional balance between not giving too much away and telling the Queen of the Shadowlands the absolute truth. “There are some magic users who are hoping to burn these factions down entirely and create something new from the ashes, and I tend to agree with them.”

“I see,” the Queen said, deep in thought.

“All this to say, if these superstitions are true, this might be the big event the bear creature was warning you of.”

The Queen pondered this for a moment. The lines in her brow were deep and defined, her lips pursed. In an attempt at last-minute comfort, Traci continued. “But maybe, if you were to prepare for this specific threat, even join those who are attempting to overthrow the Lords, I have faith that you can—”

“If this coup d'état is, as you say, the probable cause of future unrest in my kingdom, then I couldn’t possibly allow it to come to pass, let alone join the cause. I appreciate your suggestion, Traci, but it’s out of the question.”

Traci bit the inside of her cheek. “Maybe I misspoke. These Lords are not even doing their jobs, they only seem able to make other lives worse. If these systems get replaced, especially with your help and guidance to make sure your kingdom is factored into the equation, then I can’t see that as anything but a good thing.”

Queen Eve frowned. “If these Lords are as powerful as you make them out to be, and one day they are entirely dissolved, that could throw everything into chaos, regardless of how quickly you rebuild something to take its place. And that chaos could be the difference between my kingdom thriving and dying.” She leaned backwards in her chair. “I’m sorry, Traci, I can’t help you in that respect. But thank you for the warning.”

There was a fire inside of Traci, a voice that wanted to call Eve out. She had once given the Queen her word that if there was something on its way, the Shadowpact would be there to help; she had hoped, perhaps naively, that the sentiment was mutual. But ultimately, unfortunately, she had a point. Traci swallowed her embarrassment and her pride, instead bowing for the Queen. “That’s all, Your Majesty.”

For context, during the week my availability is strictly after 4pm due to me having another job. I have open availability on the weekends yet somehow, my manager seems to pass me up when trying to help people in my store grow. I never call out unless I’m like super sick (which was only once in the last two years) and I ask for days I need way in advance. 
Last year she was looking for people to become coffee masters and I sincerely expressed my interest in doing so and got a little excited. Time passed and hadn’t heard back from her (my manager ONLY works mornings and is unavailable once she leaves for the day). So a few weeks after I found out that she had hand picked people (some that wanted to and some that she wanted) to do the program and only two out of four completed the training for that and I recently heard she wants more people to do it and no one wants to. 
The next was similar but with the barista trainer and again I was passed up. 
now we have two shifts leaving and she asked our store that if we were interested to see her and she would help them. Well I show up the day she had set aside for this and she said I needed a pdp (which I hadn’t done in the two years I’ve been there) so she gave me a blank one and sent me on my way. I asked another shift supervisor for help and was able to complete and now she doesn’t want to schedule an assessment for me because of my availability.
My other job is pretty flexible in which I have been able to attend all my store meetings during the day or have left work early to help with coverage and yet that’s the excuse she gave me and now I feel like she just doesn’t want me to grow and is using availability to stop me from growing in the company.

The problem was she was in another country, she asked me to promise if I was to give her this chance she would fly back to make things work, I told her I’d agree only if she was serious because I can’t go through the emotional roller coaster again because at that point I accepted the break up and was moving forward in my life, but i loved this woman so agreed.

1l4q1zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1l4q1zb/20250605_fitness_forward_trends_shaping_your/,(2025-06-05) Fitness Forward Trends Shaping Your Summer Body,"## Fitness News Roundup: June 5, 2025

The world of fitness saw a flurry of activity on June 5, 2025, with a focus on weight loss transformations, effective workout routines, and the daily lives of fitness-conscious individuals. From personal journeys to expert advice, the day’s news highlighted the multifaceted nature of health and well-being.

One of the most compelling stories of the day centered on singer and music composer Adnan Sami and his remarkable 120 kg weight loss. Recounting his experience on ""Aap Ki Adalat,"" Sami revealed the pivotal moment that spurred his transformation. He described a stark warning from his doctor at Cromwell Hospital in London, who, after an examination, declared his health was at a critical point. The doctor’s prediction of a potential premature death within six months due to Sami's lifestyle served as a wake-up call, ultimately leading him to adopt healthier habits. This story highlights the importance of recognizing health risks and the power of a personal turning point in initiating significant lifestyle changes.

The efficacy of daily walking routines also took center stage. Building on previous discussions about the benefits of walking, experts examined whether walking 7,000 steps daily could achieve fitness goals. Dr. Rituja Ugalmugle, a consultant physician at Wockhardt Hospitals in Mumbai Central, emphasized the substantial health advantages associated with a consistent 7,000-step routine, coupled with proper nutrition and adequate rest. These benefits include improved cardiovascular fitness, weight management, enhanced mood, and increased energy levels. This piece provides practical guidance, underscoring the significance of consistency and a holistic approach to health, rather than just the absolute number of steps. The contrast between the recommended 10,000 steps and the 7,000 steps presents a more accessible target for individuals seeking to incorporate more physical activity into their lives.

Adding a glimpse into the daily routines of successful individuals, the news also featured a day in the life of Sara Tendulkar, a registered nutritionist and daughter of Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar. Tendulkar documented her day via social media, offering a relatable look at how she integrates fitness into her busy schedule. The narrative began with a cup of coffee, setting the tone for the day. Her second priority was a workout session, which involved a Pilates Reformer workout. The next activity on her list included a quick shower and applying a touch of makeup – specifically sunscreen, concealer, and lip and cheek tint, showing a practical approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and personal grooming. This insight into Tendulkar's life demonstrated how fitness can be seamlessly woven into a regular day.

Beyond personal transformations and daily routines, the news also delved into specific workout techniques. The focus was on the Navasana, or boat pose, as a highly effective core exercise. Contrary to the common perception of yoga as solely a calming practice, experts highlighted the intensity and precision that the right yoga poses can offer. Research from Auburn University in Montgomery ranked Navasana among the most effective core exercises across yoga and Pilates. Additionally, renowned yoga teacher Sharath Jois was quoted, stating that holding the pose for 25 breaths – broken into five-breath rounds with rests in between – could rival the effects of 100 traditional sit-ups. This information offered a fresh perspective on yoga, highlighting its potential as a challenging and effective workout, even for individuals accustomed to more rigorous fitness regimes. This section demonstrated the importance of incorporating variety and leveraging the power of bodyweight exercises in a fitness plan.

1l4q122,https://i.redd.it/80wfn1m7la5f1.jpeg,Phytoca 30:30:30 gummies,"I know, I know another Phytoca review. 

But as someone who only uses edibles, seeing contant flower/vape/gear reviews are kinda pointless to me and I am sure there is a few of us out prefer to eat their mc rather than inhale it might find this helpful.

I usually have the Stanley Nights 20:10 gummies and take 1/2 to one every night and they are fairly well priced. However when I saw the Phytoca and the price, for 60 compared to 30 I thought I would give them ago. The inclusion of CBN was also a bonus as I understand it can really help with sleep.

Ok, so First things first the smell and taste is pretty powerful. They are supposed to be blackcurrant flavour. Being rosin, I guess it's hard to make them taste anything apart from weed. I mean, I cannot taste the blackcurrant at all. They taste like the scrapings out of my coffee grinder from back in the day when I used to smoke. Not the worst but definitely not tasty like the Stanleys.

The gummies are nice and firm, easy to cut. I'm just taking half at the moment to compare with usage of the Stanleys.

For me, they seem to take a little longer to kick in, bit longer than an hour until I felt anything, then another 30 minutes until full effect. Very chill relaxing of my muscles allow backpain and pelvic pain to almost completely melt away. Slept so well through the nights and when I wake up, I have been feeling refreshed. Others have mentioned they still felt stoned in the morning which is not something I have experienced yet, but that could be due to taking only half. 

I had been finding with the Stanleys, they would get me to sleep fairly quickly but I would wake up part way through the night and feel kinda shady in the morning.

Weirdly, another nice thing about the Phytoca, is I have had less cotton mouth even with the mega weed taste lol.

All up, I have to say for the price and the results I am seeing so far, I will be keeping these as my regular night gummie.

He threw the picture on the table and I saw it! My husband was pecking this lady, like a full-blown peck!
My hands were trembling and I was too stunned to say anything. The only thing I could think of was
'What is happening?'
————————
Sarah Wells
Today was supposed to be my 20th anniversary of marriage with Thomas, but instead of going out to celebrate, I was at home waiting for my kids to come home from school. Thomas was away on a business trip. He sent out sweet messages throughout the day, saying that he will come home soon and we would celebrate then.
Was I sad that he's away on our wedding anniversary? Of course I was sad! But I learnt to deal with it since he travels a lot for his work. Besides, I have my kids with me. My three wonderful kids, Armin, Alden and Aya.
We were planning to go out for dinner, just the four of us. I was sipping through my cup of tea when the doorbell rang. I peeped through the peephole, and saw no one.
Forty minutes later, the kids arrived home and Aya greeted me with a hug, ""Hi mom! How was your day?""
I love my youngest for being super sweet. ""It was okay, I managed to finish some of my pending worksheets."" I work from home, as a tutor and a part-time writer. I made sure my Degree did not go to waste and I have at least some back-up financial plans for myself.
Armin came to me, ""Mom, there's a brown envelope for you. No address, no stamps, just your name. It was left on the doormat, weird.""
Weirdly enough, there was no address written on the envelope. Just my name, Sarah Wells.
""Thanks Armin. Can you stay with me?"" I did not know why I asked him to stay, but my 17 year old son sat right next to me.
I opened the envelope and there were pictures, tons of pictures, of my husband and another woman. A picture of him hugging the woman in a park. A picture of him in his car, with the woman next to him. The final straw, a picture that was on Armin's hand. He looked furious.
""Mom, enough! Don't look at these anymore. Let's go!""
He threw the picture on the table and I saw it! Thomas was pecking this lady, like a full-blown peck!
My hands were trembling and I was too stunned to say anything. The only thing I could think of was
'What is happening?'.
Then, I realized that Armin was next to me, holding my hand. I felt sorry for him, having to witnessed something awful like this in his life.
""Mom, I'm here! I won't go anywhere."" My son, my first-born, was there to comfort me and he needs it too.
""Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry I made you stay next to me. I'm sorry that you're seeing this.""
He hugged me, ""Mom, it is not your fault. I am glad you asked me to stay, and you're not alone.""
I was trying my best not to cry. I have to be strong for him, for Alden and Aya too.
""Let's go mom! You don't have to say anything to Alden and Aya. I will handle them. Let's go to Nan's house now.""
Their Nan, my mother, lives fifteen minutes from us. My stepfather bought the place five years ago stating that he wants to be closer to his grandkids and me.
Within twenty minutes, we were all packed up to stay at my parents' house. ""Let me drive mom.""
I looked at Armin, ""Thank you sweetheart.""
Alden and Aya were curious but I bet Armin asked them to keep quiet and just pack their bags to sleep at Nan's place.
The car ride to my parents' house was quiet. The tension in the air was obvious and my kids decided to give me some space.
When we arrived, my mom was outside, mending her flowers. It's a nice cottage that fits my parents and my family whenever we want to sleepover.
""Nan! Where's Papa?"" My youngest, Aya, is closed to my stepdad. She's Papa's princess all the way.
""Papa is the kitchen, making coffee. Why are you guys here? In the middle of school week?""
I was still sitting in the car. I looked at my mom, and I started crying. I could not held it any longer when I saw my mom. She panicked, but Armin and Alden stopped her. I saw them talking to my mother for five minutes before she came to me.
""Oh darling! I am so sorry that you are going through this. I will kill him if he comes here!"" She hugged me, and held my hand.
""Ma, let's sit at the gazebo. I need to calm myself down. I don't want the kids to see me crying.""
So, we sat at the gazebo that my dad built. Ten minutes passed, and she said nothing to me. She's giving me some space, and I appreciated it so much.
After what it seems like hours of silence, my mother broke her voice, ""Sarah, how do you feel right now?""
""I honestly don't know Ma. I'm sad, heartbroken. I feel betrayed. How can my own husband of twenty years go behind my back and cheat on me. I feel awful for the kids. There are so many things on my mind, I don't know where to start, what to do.""
Ma held my hand, ""I know this is hard for you. Though I have never been through this but your dad and I will help you and the kids. We will be here, this is your home too.""
I want to keep moving forward. I have to make decisions for myself and for my kids.
""I need to take actions as soon as possible Ma. There are a lot of things that are needed to be done before Thomas comes back. I don't want to stay in that house anymore. I have to discuss with the kids first about the living and school arrangements.""
Ma hugged me, ""You can stay here, as long as you want. We will help you, just tell us what to do.""
With the support system that I have right now, I know I can go through this as soon as possible. The longer I cry and grieve, the longer my kids would suffer. I won't let them down. I will do anything to keep them happy.
Then, I saw my kids coming towards the gazebo with a tray filled with cookies and a pot of tea. The sight of my three kids, trying to make me feel better was just heartwarming.
My mother whispered, ""Your kids are wonderful. They will always have your back. Don't worry, they are big enough to understand what's going on.""
Aya came to me and hugged me, ""We made your favourite tea Mom. We hope you feel a bit better by now. We are here for you!""
I gave my children a group hug, and my parents joined as well. This made me more determined to move on. I am sure I can go through this betrayal with the support that I have.
""Alright, let's go inside! I have plans that I want to share with all of you. But we have to get dinner first.""
Dad was quick enough to say that we will have pizza and Chinese for dinner. ""I will make calls for dinner, no worries. Kids, go freshen up. Sarah, take a rest in your room. I will call you once dinner is ready.""
An hour later, all of us were gathered in the dining room, ready for dinner. ""We will not discuss anything now, let's have a nice dinner without distractions"", said my dad.
We ate dinner as usual, not thinking about the current predicament that we're having. The children were telling my parents about school stuff and things that they want to do in summer.",1,1749208424.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


I am particularly keen to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

On the Currency Quick Filters, you can now hide runes up until Lesser, Normal or Greater. Greater runes exclude all special ones; those will never be hidden through this feature.

1l4pohk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1l4pohk/looking_for_advice_from_people_who_also_struggle/,Looking for advice from people who also struggle with self-worth and asking for or accepting help from others,"How do you navigate feelings of shame when accepting or asking for help - especially if it's being offered when you’re struggling and haven't been very nice or attentive to the person offering help?

For a bit of context,  I have realised recently that I struggle a lot with very deep feelings that I am undeserving of love/care or just deficient in some unknown way. 

I often feel that I need to prove myself by being hyper-independent and 'the best' at everything but this comes with a constant stream of negative self-talk when I don't meet my unrealistic expectations. This puts me into a situation where I have not looked after myself (e.g., sleeping or eating enough) to meet my high expectations, and then I complain about this. When I am offered help in these situations (e.g., my partner offers to go pick up a coffee for me when I've slept in an am panicking because I have so much to do) my brain does not automatically see this help as kind and loving, rather my brain just sees it as an indication that I am a failure, and worries my partner will leave me because of it. 

I seek a lot of reassurance in these situations, which is honestly probably just annoying the people around me even more. 

I have realised I complain a lot, and that is keeping me in a negative mind frame. I think the complaining may stem from a need to not be seen as weak (i.e., if people understand I'm in difficult circumstances, then it will excuse my deficiencies). The complaining of course ends in others feeling bad for me, and offering to help, which then makes me feel even worse about myself! 

I have also realised that when I am struggling, it can make me unintentionally mean to the people I love. I can't name the feelings I have in these moments very well, but they feel the same as the receiving help when I'm struggling feelings. 

When I am feeling really shit, I struggle to catch when my tone or patience levels have changed. It's pretty selfish, but not intentional.  In these moments I don't really know what's going on or why I can't seem to see the impact I am having on others when I am usually so hypervigilant (something I am working on). 

I think in both these situations I get very fearful and hypervigilant for small indications that people don't really love/care about me. 

This is obviously not fun, and is very rooted in my emotionally traumatic upbringing (I'm sure my late diagnosed adhd also plays a role too). I plan to talk about this in therapy, but was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if there is terminology for this kind of emotional spiral. I'd love to look into some resources because I really don't want to keep treating myself or the people around me poorly.

The way she panicked and pushed me away reminded me of a kitten I used to have that scratched me when it got scared. I’d already finished showering, and she was still in the room. That made her my prey now—and I had no intention of letting her leave my sight. Tonight, I was going to fuck her until the corners of her eyes turned red—until she cried for me. I glanced toward the nightstand to remind her: the hotel had condoms neatly arranged in various styles. The Continental Hotel, after all, was one of the Feron mafia family’s crown jewels. Every detail of the guest experience was taken care of. She looked a little surprised. Didn’t seem like the type to frequent a place like this. I-I’m gonna take a shower,” she stammered. I could hear the tremble in her voice. Her wide eyes looked like a startled fawn’s. I stared calmly at the tips of her ears as they turned pink and smirked. “You should’ve just showered with me. I could’ve taken you in the bathroom. Her ears flushed even redder. That was cute. She’d clearly thrown herself into my arms on purpose. Every move calculated. But now, when it came down to actual sex, she was acting like a blushing virgin. Strange. You’d think that now we were alone, she’d keep pushing the seduction. But instead, she was flustered—nervous, even afraid. When she came out of the shower, wrapped in a towel, I was already hard. I’d wanted to fuck her back at the Leisure Palace. She was beautiful. Her figure was insanely tempting. And most importantly, her scent didn’t put me off. Come here.” My voice came out rough, almost hoarse. My desire was boiling over… Dammit… You b\*tch. You really dared to seduce me, huh?” She whimpered beneath me, her pussy wet and warm. I pounded into her. I knew how to make a woman come. One hand gripped her throat while I drove deep into her. Oh—no, Silas! I’m gonna die!” Her legs locked around my waist. I got what I wanted—her crying beneath me, her eyes red and watery. For once, I left the lights on. I wanted to see her—wanted to watch her fall apart under me. Wanted to see the way her whole body flushed when she came. She was like a drug, addicting, pulling me into endless thrusts, slamming into her over and over again. Every now and then, I’d slow down, just to tease her. She’d look back at me like a lost deer, craving more. Beg for it.” I kept my rhythm slow, my hand tight around her throat.  
Please…” she murmured. But it wasn’t enough. A proper little slut should beg better than that. So I slowed even more. Not good enough,” I teased. Then I motioned for her to turn around—get on her hands and knees.  
  
Right then, I wanted to make her fall for me. I wanted her to come back, beg for more, become mine willingly.  
  
“Please, fuck me… fuck me hard! I’m just a filthy slut who needs your big cock…” I’d been holding back long enough. That was all I needed to hear. Before she even finished the sentence, I was pounding into her again, fast and rough.  
  
My hands moved to her tits. They bounced with every thrust. I squeezed and grabbed without mercy.  
  
She moaned like a dog, crying that she was going to die again.  
  
I didn’t even know how long we kept going. At some point, she passed out. Weak little thing. I kept fucking her—her pussy soaking wet, clinging to me like it never wanted to let go.  
  
Eventually, I realized if I kept going, she wouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow. I went to wash up, cooled myself off, then came back and wiped her down. I even dressed her in a fresh pair of panties that my assistant had sent over.  
  
When I finally lay down beside her, my dick was hard again. Damn it.  
  
I didn’t know how long I’d been asleep, but the second I felt her stir, I was fully alert. Still, I kept my breathing steady, pretending to sleep.  
  
In the underworld, the tiniest sound could wake me. I wanted to see what she’d do after a night like that.  
  
Would she ask me to punish Vincent? Or maybe go after the woman Vincent was screwing?  
  
Then I heard the door open. I opened my eyes.  
  
There was a stack of cash on the nightstand. I nearly laughed.  
  
In the financial empire the Feron mafia family controlled, that money wouldn’t even pay for a bottle of whiskey at my club.  
  
She’d also left a note. The line “Goodbye for good” read more like a slap in the face.  
  
She actually thought she could treat me like a one-night stand.  
  
I tossed the note in the trash and pocketed the cash.  
  
Just then, my assistant Carl called. “The plane tickets are ready.”  
  
I fastened my cufflinks and said coldly, “Have someone investigate that woman from last night. I want everything—phone records, social media, bank statements. Go back three months. I want to know everyone she’s come into contact with.”  
  
Before hanging up, I added, “Pay special attention to any links with rival families.”  
  
If she’s clean—not a plant from another mafia family—I might just keep her around as a mistress. Help her get revenge on Vincent.  
  
As for Vincent… the guy’s a horny fool with a temper.  
  
It’s about time he learned a hard lesson.



**Chapter 5 Just Get Divorced Already**



Luna Feron's POV:  
  
My heart was still pounding as I walked out of the hotel lobby.  
  
A blast of disinfectant-scented air hit me as the revolving doors of the Continental Hotel spun open. It stung my cheeks and sobered me up a little more.  
  
Verona’s streets bustled with traffic. Every man in a suit I brushed past reminded me of the cold darkness in Silas’s eyes—that ruthless glint only a mafia boss could carry.  
  
*I really slept with the head of the Feron mafia family…*  
  
This wasn’t a dream. It was real. My body still ached with the memory of last night’s sex.  
  
I couldn’t stop thinking about the way he’d wrapped his hand around my throat, fucking me to the edge of breathlessness and pulling me into an orgasm...  
  
The thought alone left my mouth dry, a wave of heat tingling through me.  
  
I smacked myself in the head and quickly flagged down a cab to head home.  
  
Vincent’s family wasn’t particularly impressive compared to the rest of the Feron mafia family. Most of the time, they were the ones doing the sucking up.  
  
Before stepping inside the house, I double-checked that no suspicious marks were showing on my skin. Only when I was sure did I walk in.  
  
At the foyer, my mother-in-law Claudia’s Hermès scarf lay draped over the carved wooden armchair—one of the “finer pieces” smuggled through the mafia family’s luxury goods ring.  
  
I adjusted my clothes and hair several times in the entryway mirror, making absolutely sure there were no traces left on me—no scent, no signs. Then I took a deep breath and stepped in.  
  
“Mom.” I greeted her, keeping my tone sweet.  
  
“You dare show your face here?!” Claudia slammed her coffee cup down. The sharp clatter of porcelain made me flinch.  
  
Funny. I remembered when I first moved in with Vincent—she’d told me all the dishes were expensive bone china and warned me to be extra careful during chores.  
  
She jabbed a red-lacquered finger at me. The three-carat diamond ring on it glinted with a harsh light—another trophy from the mafia family’s money-laundering casinos.  
  
“Divorce! You’re divorcing my son—now!” she screamed, her voice echoing through the entire living room. The house staff scattered immediately.  
  
That was how things worked in Vincent’s family. When the master of the house got angry, no servant was allowed to witness it.  
  
I clenched my hands so tightly my nails dug into my palms. My eyes drifted to the rhinestone-covered belt on her robe, remembering what she’d said three years ago when I married Vincent: “A girl from the slums who got herself into this family by spreading her legs.”  
  
I knew my background wasn’t impressive. Even as a side branch of the mafia family, Vincent’s family had real power.  
  
But I’d worked hard. Even if I didn’t have access to the mafia family’s underworld, I had carved out my place. A “girl from the slums” had risen to become the chief senior translator at the mafia family’s legitimate corporate front. I wasn’t talentless.  
  
I had endured it all—for love, for this home. I never fought back when Claudia insulted me. I never touched a dime of Vincent’s money. And yet Vincent had still cheated.  
  
I told myself to hold it together. I took a breath and said, “Mom, I didn’t skip the appointment with that doctor on purpose. Something came up at work…” I forced a smile and reached out to take her stiff arm, trying to calm her down before she exploded again.  
  
“Don’t call me Mom!” Claudia yanked her arm away. A strong whiff of Chanel No. 5 hit me, and I wrinkled my nose.  
  
“If you can’t give me a grandson, then divorce my son!”  
  
“Don’t worry. If I can’t get pregnant this time…” I paused, struggling to keep my voice steady, “I’ll divorce Vincent.”  
  
Outside the window, a crow landed on the iron railing and let out a harsh screech.  
  
Claudia’s expression immediately softened.  
  
Her thick palm smacked against my belly like she was checking the quality of a product on a shelf. In her eyes, I was nothing but a surrogate.  
  
I fought the urge to vomit. I thought of Silas’s burning touch on my waist last night—firm and inescapable in a completely different way.  
  
I didn’t bother with Claudia after that. I went upstairs, changed clothes, and drove straight to the office.  
  
Standing in front of the Feron mafia family corporate tower, I caught my reflection in the glass wall—pale and tired.  
  
Between the thirty-third floor where Planning was and the ninth floor where Translation sat, the distance wasn’t just physical.  
  
My eyes burned. I swallowed the lump in my throat and stepped into the elevator. As it rose, the mirrored wall reflected my empty hands.  
  
No wedding ring. Not even a mark.  
  
We’d been married a year, and Vincent had never once worn a ring. He’d told me the mafia family hated nepotism and that we had to keep our relationship secret.  
  
So no one at the company even knew we were married.  
  
Looking back now, *God, I was so stupid.*  
  
From the start, he was just worried our marriage would ruin his value on the family matchmaking circuit—afraid I’d ruin his fun chasing other women.  
  
I dropped my car keys into my purse and caught sight of something: a square cufflink. I recognized the brand—luxury. Just one of those cufflinks cost over 200 grand.  
  
I stared at it, holding it between my fingers.  
  
Vincent could never afford something like this.  
  
And in a flash, Silas’s face appeared in my mind.  
  
My heart skipped a beat.



**Chapter 6 That Woman’s Perfume**



Luna Feron's POV:  
  
Why was Silas’s cufflink in my bag?  
  
In the vast underground empire controlled by the Feron mafia family, a $200,000 cufflink was probably nothing more than a rounding error in their laundering accounts. But right now, it felt like a searing brand against my skin—proof of the madness that had unfolded the night before.  
  
Verona’s midday sun was almost blinding. The glass façade of the Feron mafia family Group’s skyscraper reflected the silhouettes of smuggling freighters docking at the port.  
  
I stepped through the revolving doors in my ten-centimeter heels—only to hear a familiar laugh at the corner. Mixed with the sharp scent of Black Opium.  
  
Vincent · the Feron mafia family. My husband, at least in name. His arm was wrapped around the waist of his boss, Erica.  
  
There was a hickey on the side of her neck, barely hidden beneath the collar of her custom Chanel blouse. I stared at her a moment longer than I should have.  
  
It was her. The same woman I’d seen him screwing last night.  
  
“Vincent.” I called his name, my voice colder than the ocean wind blowing in from the Verona port.  
  
He turned. His pupils contracted sharply—his wife, the one who was supposed to be in Minch, was now standing face-to-face with him and his mistress.  
  
Erica’s fingers, painted in dark polish, traced his collar lazily. She didn’t bother hiding the mark on her neck. Before walking off, she even arched a brow at me—mocking me, laughing in my face.  
  
Once the elevator doors closed behind us, Vincent dropped the act.  
  
“She’s my boss,” he said, loosening his tie. “She was just asking me about last week’s report.”  
  
As his Adam’s apple bobbed, I couldn’t help but recall the way he’d looked and sounded in bed with her last night…  
  
My whole body trembled from rage. *Stay calm. Don’t lose it here.*  
  
In the tight elevator, the scent of his cologne was suffocating. It was the same one Erica wore—strong, pungent, overwhelming.  
  
He noticed me sniffing the air and quickly explained, “My boss is obsessed with perfume. She sprays so much of it, I can’t even escape it!” He even threw in a pained expression for effect.  
  
“Weren’t you supposed to be on a business trip to Minch?” he added, clearly trying to change the subject.  
  
I clutched my clutch bag tighter, my gut twisting, emotions mixing with bitterness.  
  
After what happened to me in college, I developed a trauma around sex. Even after marrying Vincent, I just couldn’t do it. We’d never once consummated our marriage.  
  
Vincent was a normal man. Of course he had needs. He could’ve just been honest with me—told me he needed it. I would’ve tried even harder to face my issues.  
  
But he never said a word. He just ran straight into his boss’s bed.  
  
And now… the thrill of last night’s revenge on him was starting to fade.  
  
“Did you forget?” I said, voice sharp. “Yesterday was our one-year wedding anniversary.”  
  
Vincent’s face twitched. My eyes drifted to the bulge in his jacket pocket—square, box-shaped. A jewelry box.  
  
“I’m sorry. I completely forgot about it. But…” He pulled the box out and opened it. Inside was a diamond ring. “I did get you a gift.”  
  
I stared at the ring.  
  
It was identical to the pair of earrings Erica had on.  
  
Probably meant for her, too.  
  
Disgust rose in my throat. I instinctively took a step back.  
  
“What’s wrong? You don’t like the ring?”  
  
“I do. But we’re at the office. It wouldn’t look good if anyone saw.” I gave the perfect excuse and took the ring from his hand.  
  
He didn’t doubt me for a second. He placed a hand on my shoulder and said gently, “Let’s go out for dinner tonight. I’ll make it up to you.”  
  
That sickly perfume of hers clung to him—it was nauseating. I fought the urge to shove him away.  
  
Ding. The elevator doors slid open. A coworker stood outside.  
  
He was about to step in, but froze when he saw how close Vincent and I were. His eyes lit up with curiosity.  
  
Vincent reacted quickly. He moved his hand off my shoulder and said to the guy, “She’s wearing heels—almost lost her balance. Just lending a hand.”  
  
That explanation—trying to hide our marriage while his mistress could parade around in public—disgusted me more than Erica’s smug smirk.  
  
Back at my desk, my hands trembled as I opened my laptop. The clack of the keyboard mixed with the distant blare of cargo horns from the port outside. An email popped up—from my lawyer. The divorce papers.  
  
I had hard evidence of Vincent’s cheating. He wasn’t going to screw me over financially. I’d make sure I walked away with at least half.  
  
As the sun set, my phone lit up with an emergency assignment from the New York branch.  
  
I didn’t even have time to pack.  
  
I headed straight to the airport that night.

We’re at a pivotal moment in the $ATYR timeline. After weeks of mounting momentum, a string of clinical and investor-facing events have now reset the chessboard. The SSC-ILD interim readout has landed. The Jefferies conference presentation has come and gone. The share price is pressing toward multi-month highs on expanding volume. And beneath it all, the options market is quietly but decisively rewriting the story.

This post isn’t just a technical analysis or a recap of options data. It’s an attempt to understand what the structure of the $ATYR options chain — across time, strike, volatility, and gamma exposure — is telling us about how the market sees the future.

Because in setups like this — where the underlying is a low-float biotech coming off a clean clinical signal, with another binary catalyst on deck — options are not passive instruments. They are active components in a reflexive loop. They shape dealer hedging behaviour, influence spot price movement, and amplify crowd psychology on both the institutional and retail sides of the trade. What begins as a hedge often becomes a catalyst. What looks like positioning can become prophecy.

And right now, the options chain is dense with signal — both in what’s being bet on, and what isn’t.

This post lays out:
- **Why options mechanics matter more than ever in the current $ATYR setup**
- **How to interpret the full chain across expiries**
- **What the Gamma Exposure (GEX) regime shift means in practical terms**
- **Where the structure might break — and how it might bend first**

If you’ve been watching this stock but unsure how to read the derivatives flow — or if you’re trying to gauge where reflexive behaviour may be reinforcing price action — this post is designed to bring you clarity around what can be a complex topic; in a way that I hope you’ll find easy to understand. Beyond that, I hope you’ll find it useful!

## 2. Why Options Mechanics Matter in a Setup Like This

In setups like $ATYR, the options chain isn’t just a sideshow — it actually becomes part of the main act. When float is tight, catalysts are binary, and liquidity is concentrated in a few expiry dates, the mechanics of the chain shape price discovery itself. The structure of open interest, the skew of implied volatility, and the shifts in gamma exposure don’t just tell us what the market thinks might happen — they can influence *how* it happens.

---

### A. Reflexivity and Feedback Loops

**In my view**, the most important concept for retail investors to understand right now is *reflexivity*. This is the idea that market expectations can reinforce themselves. When options flows become lopsided — whether through a wave of call buying, put selling, or volatility positioning — it forces market makers and dealers to hedge. That hedging, in turn, can move the price, which then reinforces the original positioning.

The key feedback loops in play:

- **Call buying → Dealer delta hedging → Spot buying**  
- **Put selling → Dealer short volatility exposure → Spot price support**  
- **Implied volatility rising → Higher premiums → Gamma-rich zones emerge**  
- **Gamma flipping positive → Price pinning or forced acceleration through key levels**

These dynamics are amplified in low-float names where relatively small changes in open interest or volume can shift dealer positioning quickly. For a name like $ATYR — with under 90M shares outstanding, limited institutional float, and asymmetric interest from both retail and hedge funds — the options structure exerts a disproportionate influence on short-term price behaviour.

---

### B. Why This Week in Particular

This is a uniquely important moment to understand the mechanics because we’re moving from a post-catalyst reaction to a potential pre-breakout reconfiguration. The SSC-ILD interim readout and Jefferies commentary were enough to trigger a repricing. But what comes next — the Phase 3 sarcoidosis readout, follow-on institutional positioning, and capital raise speculation — is harder to model using fundamentals alone.

The options chain gives us:

- A window into *who is positioning* and *where the market expects resistance or support*  
- Insight into which strike zones are “loaded” (high gamma, high OI) and which are empty  
- Clues as to whether dealers are short or long gamma, which can flip the structure from suppressive to explosive

In short: the options market is a **sentiment barometer**, a **probability map**, and a **positioning tell** — all at once. But only if we look closely.

Next, we’ll do exactly that.

---

## 3. Detailed Breakdown of the Current Chain

Understanding the current $ATYR options setup requires more than glancing at a few high-OI strikes. The structure here is complex — layered with short-term speculative flows, medium-term event risk positioning, and longer-term asymmetric bets on commercialisation or a re-rating. And unlike many biotech names, this isn’t just a few contracts scattered across retail strikes. The distribution of open interest, volume, implied volatility, and delta across time and price levels suggests an increasingly sophisticated ecosystem of participants — some trading short-term catalysts, some absorbing Vega, and others possibly executing longer-duration strategies.

Let’s go expiry by expiry, starting with the nearest-term expiry — **June 20, 2025** — and then expanding into July, August, and LEAPS. Each tells a different part of the story.

---

### A. June 20, 2025: The Frontline of the Current Setup

This expiry is where the majority of the market is concentrated right now. It absorbs the momentum coming out of the SSC-ILD readout and the Jefferies conference, and captures any residual volatility tied to positioning around early July institutional accumulation or a potential capital raise window.

Here’s a table of the most active strikes for June 20, with interpretive commentary following:

| Strike | Call OI | Put OI | Call Vol | Put Vol | Call IV | Put IV | Call Δ | Put Δ |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 4.00   | 65      | 310    | 2        | 1       | 146.2%  | 137.2% | 0.87   | -0.12  |
| 5.00   | 601     | 282    | 138      | 27      | 99.3%   | 87.9%  | 0.66   | -0.33  |
| 6.00   | 2,951   | 54     | 390      | 0       | 106.9%  | 102.3% | 0.33   | -0.68  |
| 7.50   | 611     | 20     | 69       | 1       | 129.5%  | 84.7%  | 0.12   | -0.97  |

**Key Observations:**
- **$6.00C** is the dominant strike in both open interest and volume. With nearly 3,000 contracts open and 390 traded on a single day, this isn’t residual positioning — it’s active and growing. The delta of 0.33 means many of these contracts sit just OTM, and if spot price lifts above $6.00, dealer hedging obligations increase materially. That can reinforce upward price pressure.
- The **$5.00C** also carries significant weight, with over 600 OI and 138 daily volume. This strike is now deep ITM, with a delta of 0.66, and is likely already hedged to some degree. But the volume here suggests traders are either rolling up from $4.00, or layering further directional bets using higher gamma contracts.
- **Put OI** is concentrated at $4.00 and $5.00, with no meaningful protection below. This matters. It suggests that traders are not positioning for a near-term crash. In fact, the relatively sparse put activity — especially at deeper OTM levels — indicates that downside hedging demand is weak, or already unwound after the positive readout. That reinforces the idea that the market sees the next significant move as likely to be up, not down.
- **IV structure** remains elevated across the board. While IV has come down from pre-readout peaks, the fact that $6.00C is still trading over 100% IV — despite sitting just OTM — means that the market continues to price in meaningful volatility in the next two weeks. This isn’t a chain pricing in decay — it’s pricing in movement.

**In my view:**  
The June 20 chain is not just about speculation — it’s a reflection of reflexive structural positioning. You have elevated IV, OTM strikes absorbing fresh volume, and a clearly defined battleground around the $6.00 mark. That’s where dealers are most exposed, and where the next inflection will likely emerge. If price continues to rise, gamma will force dealers to buy more to stay hedged. If price stalls below $6.00, the risk of pinning increases — but even then, volatility remains high enough that unwinds could be sharp.

---

### B. July 19 & August 16, 2025: The Event Risk Horizon

As we look beyond June, we find that the next two monthly expiries — July 19 and August 16 — begin to reflect a different kind of positioning. These are not high-volume, short-delta strikes. These are staging grounds for event-linked gamma hedging and directional optionality.

**Observations:**
- **Call OI** is beginning to build at $7.50 and $10.00 strikes across both months. These are clearly not neutral hedges — they’re directional bets, often placed with lower deltas (~0.1–0.2) but high Vega exposure. This suggests traders are willing to pay for optionality on a breakout. The implied volatility at these strikes remains elevated (~130–160%), which indicates that even out-the-money options are retaining premium. That usually only happens when market makers are being forced to sell volatility into demand — another sign of bullish skew.
- **Put OI** remains thin, consistent with the pattern seen in June. There’s no structural downside protection showing up in these expiries. That doesn’t mean downside is impossible — but it does suggest that the options market is not expecting (or hedging for) a collapse through July or August.
- These expiries coincide with major potential developments:
  - Institutional follow-through after Phase 3 preview digestion
  - Potential NDA timing guidance
  - M&A speculation or early commercial signal visibility
  - Broader market sentiment shifts post-FOMC or mid-year macro resets

**In my opinion:**  
This section of the chain is where institutional players may be quietly reloading or laddering positions. The strikes are thin enough not to disrupt the price action now, but they show someone is planning for a second act.

---

### C. LEAPS: January 2026 and Beyond — Long-Term Asymmetry

The furthest-dated options — particularly those expiring in January 2026 and January 2027 — carry lighter volume, but highly instructive structure.

- The **$10.00C and $15.00C** strikes have meaningful open interest and still-elevated implied volatility. These are not casual bets — they’re asymmetric upside plays. With Vega exposure high and Theta relatively low (due to time value), these contracts function more like cheap call options on a long-term re-rating. This is where you typically see institutional call ladders, long-duration convexity trades, or early positioning for a commercialisation thesis.
- There’s little or no **put activity** in these timeframes — again suggesting no one is using these expiries to hedge portfolio downside. If anything, it reflects confidence that the binary risks will be resolved long before these dates.

---

### D. To Sum Up This Section

- The **June 20 expiry** is where the tension is tightest. $6.00 is the magnet and the lid. Any breach could trigger a gamma squeeze.
- **July and August** are becoming accumulation zones for directional call buyers — especially above $7.50.
- The **LEAPS** are whispering a longer-term re-rating thesis. They aren’t crowded, but they are being watched — and built.

**In my view:**  
The entire chain reflects a market that is not complacent, but also not afraid. Volatility is being bought, not sold. Protection is being ignored, not layered. And upside skew is steep enough to suggest that someone — possibly multiple players — sees more coming.

---

## 4. Interpretive Insights – What We’re Seeing in the Chain

Now that we’ve laid out the structure of the chain — expiry by expiry, strike by strike — the next step is to interpret what this setup actually means. The options market is not static. It evolves in response to price, sentiment, catalysts, and risk perception. The way that open interest clusters, the slope of the implied volatility curve, and the balance of call and put activity all tell us something about how participants are thinking — and how the structure itself could shape price in the weeks ahead.

Here are the most salient interpretive signals embedded in the current chain.

---

### A. The $6.00 Call Wall Is Doing Real Work

The open interest at $6.00C for June 20 is abnormally large — 2,951 contracts — and accompanied by consistently high volume. This is not stale positioning. It’s a dynamic, reflexive zone that is actively shaping how the stock trades.

**In my view**, this strike is behaving as a magnet, ceiling, and signal — all at once:
- **As a magnet**, it reflects the gravitational centre of positioning. When this much gamma concentrates at a single strike, dealers often hedge toward it, especially if they’re short gamma and need to buy into strength and sell into weakness.
- **As a ceiling**, it represents a point of resistance where delta hedging creates headwinds. Dealers who are short these calls have to sell shares as price approaches the strike, creating drag unless the stock breaks through with momentum.
- **As a signal**, it shows that the market isn’t afraid to lean bullishly — but it isn’t ready to chase blindly. There’s conviction, but also hesitation. That tension often precedes volatility.

If we begin to see spot price hold convincingly above $6.00 — particularly on volume — I’d expect a reflexive move higher as delta hedging flips direction. If price stalls beneath it, pinning becomes more likely into OPEX.

---

### B. Volatility Skew Is Telling Us Traders Are Chasing Upside, Not Hedging Downside

One of the most consistent signals across the chain is the shape of the implied volatility curve. IV increases as strike price increases — particularly for calls — and the curve remains steep even post-readout. This creates a classic right-tail skew, where the cost of upside optionality is being bid up more aggressively than downside protection.

| Expiry     | ATM Call IV | OTM $7.50C IV | Deep OTM $10C IV | OTM Put IV     |
|------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| June 20    | ~107%        | ~129%          | >140%             | 84–102%        |
| July 19    | ~112%        | ~135%          | ~148%             | 90–95%         |
| Jan 2026   | ~115%        | ~138%          | ~150%+            | 85–95%         |

This kind of skew typically emerges when traders are:
- Paying up for asymmetry — they see the chance of a big move, even if low probability, as worth capturing.
- Avoiding hedging costs — they aren’t looking for crash insurance, which is why OTM puts remain under-owned and under-bid.
- Expecting continuation — post-readout momentum appears more likely to lead to further upside than a full mean reversion.

The fact that this skew persists across short and long expiries suggests that this is not a short-covering reflex. It’s part of a broader re-pricing of future potential.

---

### C. The Chain Is Structurally Long Vega – But Only at Select Strikes

A subtle but important detail in the current setup is that **vega exposure** — sensitivity to changes in implied volatility — is not evenly distributed. Certain strikes (e.g. $6.00C, $7.50C, $10.00C) carry significantly higher vega per dollar than others. This means that these contracts are effectively volatility bets, not just price bets.

In practice, this means:
- If IV collapses without movement, long calls at high-IV strikes could decay rapidly, even if directionally correct.
- If volatility persists or expands, traders long those strikes benefit disproportionately.
- If realized volatility spikes, these contracts could outperform expectations even if spot price doesn’t move much.

This is important because it suggests that the smart money isn’t just betting on direction — it’s betting on magnitude. **In my opinion**, the fact that these contracts continue to be bought, even with rich IV, reflects confidence that something bigger is coming — whether it’s a full Phase 3 readout, institutional re-rating, or commercial pivot.

---

### D. Put Side Remains Thin — No Clear Demand for Downside Protection

Across nearly every expiry, the put side of the chain is structurally underdeveloped. While there is some OI at $4.00P and $5.00P for June, deeper OTM put strikes — which would normally light up if traders were nervous — remain dormant.

This tells us a few things:
- Traders are not actively hedging downside risk.
- Dealers are not being forced to adjust for put-heavy gamma, which helps explain why volatility remains elevated without collapsing.
- The base case expectation in the chain is for upside volatility, not downside risk.

In setups like this, complacency on the put side can sometimes be a contrarian signal — but in this case, it appears more consistent with post-catalyst structural realignment. Traders simply don’t see a sharp downside move as the most likely outcome.

---

### E. Overall Positioning Implies a Coiled, Directional Setup — But Not Yet Committed

Putting it all together, the current options structure reflects a **coiled spring**, not yet released:
- Calls are dominant in volume and OI
- Skew is steep to the upside
- IV remains elevated and bid across multiple expiries
- Gamma is tightly concentrated near spot price
- Vega is being carried long into July and beyond

But — and this is key — there’s still room to add. The chain is not fully crowded. The volume-to-OI ratios, especially beyond June 20, suggest that traders are positioning gradually, not chasing.

**In my view**, this is a setup that reflects high readiness, but low saturation. That’s often the precondition for reflexive moves — especially in thin-float, catalyst-driven names.

---

## 5. Market Behaviour & Dealer Positioning

Understanding options flow isn’t just about who’s buying calls and puts. It’s about what happens after those trades occur — particularly how dealers respond. When options activity reaches critical mass, the people who sold those options (usually market makers and dealers) are forced to hedge their risk in the underlying stock. That hedging — known as delta hedging — can create feedback loops that influence the stock’s price direction, momentum, and even volatility.

In this section, we’ll walk through what’s happening in $ATYR’s options market from the perspective of the dealers, and explain how the data suggests we’ve entered a new regime — one that could either reinforce a continued rally, or pin the stock tightly into expiry.

---

### A. What Is Gamma Exposure — and Why It Matters

Let’s start with a foundational concept: **gamma exposure**, or GEX. Gamma measures how much a dealer’s delta (their exposure to price movements in the underlying stock) changes as the stock price moves. The more gamma a dealer is exposed to, the more aggressively they have to adjust their hedge as the stock price moves.

- When GEX is **negative**, dealers are short gamma — they lose money on directional moves and have to chase price to stay hedged. This creates volatility amplification. Dealers are selling into weakness and buying into strength.
- When GEX is **positive**, dealers are long gamma — they profit from stability and hedge in a way that suppresses large price swings. This leads to volatility dampening. Dealers are selling into rallies and buying into dips.

For a stock like $ATYR — with a small float, thin liquidity, and a binary catalyst profile — these effects can be exaggerated. That’s why the recent flip in GEX from negative to positive is so important.

---

### B. The GEX Flip: From Volatility Amplifier to Price Buffer

Fintel’s latest gamma exposure analysis shows a major structural shift:

| Date    | Net GEX Estimate | GEX Bias         | Market Regime  |
|---------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| May 22  | –281,821         | Put-dominant     | Short Gamma    |
| May 24  | +14,082          | Transitioning    | Neutral        |
| June 3  | +61,154          | Call-dominant    | Long Gamma     |
| June 5  | +58,706          | Call-dominant    | Long Gamma     |

This is a decisive flip. Dealers are no longer being forced to chase price up or down. Instead, their hedging activity is now stabilising the price — especially around high-GEX strikes like $6.00. This is why we’ve seen price coiling just below or around $6.00, despite high volume. The GEX structure is now encouraging pinning, not breakout — at least for now.

But here’s the key nuance: GEX isn’t static. It changes as traders buy and sell new options, and as spot price moves closer to or away from loaded strikes. A breach of the $6.00 level could force a second GEX flip — from stable to explosive.

---

### C. Dealer Delta Positioning: The Hedging Behind the Curtain

Another lens through which to view dealer behaviour is **delta positioning**. Dealers who are short calls (e.g., sold to retail buyers) must hedge by buying stock in proportion to the call’s delta. As spot price approaches a high-delta strike like $6.00 or $7.50, their hedging intensity increases.

- At $6.00C, delta is ~0.33 → dealers must own 33 shares per contract to hedge.
- If spot price rises and delta increases (say to 0.45 or 0.55), dealers must buy more shares.
- This creates a reflexive loop: price goes up → delta goes up → dealers buy more → price goes up.

This is the dynamic that can cause **gamma squeezes**, especially in thin-float names. And while we haven’t seen a full squeeze yet, the conditions are forming.

Right now, the data suggests:
- Dealers are **long gamma** near $6.00, meaning they are stabilising price through hedging.
- If price jumps above $6.50 and holds, delta profiles across multiple strikes begin to shift — and hedging pressure could flip directional again.

---

### D. Strike-Level Gamma Density: Where Pinning and Breakout Risk Lives

Let’s look at where gamma is concentrated across the June 20 chain:

| Strike | GEX Estimate (Relative) | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| $5.00  | Medium                   | Already deep ITM — partially hedged    |
| $6.00  | Very High                | Primary gamma node — likely to pin     |
| $7.50  | Moderate                 | Risk zone if price lifts — can flip GEX fast |

This structure supports a **coiled price regime between $5.80 and $6.20**, with upward pressure building. If $6.00 breaks cleanly, gamma at $7.50 could activate and reintroduce short gamma dynamics.

**In my opinion**, this is a classic pre-breakout configuration. We are currently in a pinning regime — but the ingredients for an acceleration phase are present, and increasingly sensitive to new positioning or price strength.

---

### E. Dealer Behaviour Going Forward: What to Watch

The path from here depends on how the chain evolves.

**Key inflection points to watch:**
- Increase in call volume above $6.00 (esp. at $7.50 and $10.00): signals potential GEX flip
- Net GEX climbing above +75,000: stronger long gamma → tighter price containment
- Sharp decline in IV without movement: indicates dealer selling of volatility → short-term stability
- Sudden OI build at lower strikes: implies new hedging demand → possible downside risk entering the chain

The takeaway here is that **dealer positioning isn’t passive**. It shapes behaviour. It dictates whether price moves are dampened or amplified. And right now, that mechanism is sitting on a knife’s edge — it could hold the price in place, or unleash it.

---

## 6. What I’m Watching Next Week

The next few trading sessions are likely to be critical in determining how this options setup resolves. With the June 20 expiry now just two weeks away, price action, volume flows, and changes in GEX positioning will begin to accelerate — particularly if spot price moves above the $6.00 zone.

We’re now in the decision window between coiling and breakout, and the way the chain evolves over the next 3–5 sessions will offer strong clues about which way the structure might tip.

Here’s what I’ll be watching — broken into signal categories, why they matter, and what I think they could mean for the $ATYR setup:

### Key Signals & Interpretation

| **Signal**                        | **Why It Matters**                                             | **What I’ll Be Watching**                                 | **Possible Implication**                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| GEX Trend (Daily Net Gamma)      | Determines whether dealer behaviour is stabilising or amplifying price moves | If GEX climbs above +75,000 and holds                     | Continued pinning near $6.00; breakout deferred           |
| OI and Volume at $7.50C (June 20)| Indicates whether positioning is beginning to shift upward     | Sudden surge in volume or large OI jump                   | Upward migration of market expectations; squeeze risk     |
| New Call Buying in July and August | Shows directional sentiment beyond near-term expiry            | Growth in OI at $7.50C and $10.00C in later expiries       | Traders playing for a second wave post-capital raise      |
| Change in Vega Profile (by Strike) | Reflects where volatility bets are being placed                | Concentration of Vega in far OTM strikes ($10+, Jan ‘26)   | Market is betting on long-term re-rating, not just catalyst pop |
| IV Compression Without Price Move | Tells us if dealers are selling volatility into complacency    | Flattening of skew and drop in short-dated IV              | Near-term exhaustion; reduced movement likely             |
| Put Activity Below $5.00         | Would signal hedging for downside re-test                      | OI/Vol surge in deep OTM puts                              | Could indicate bearish repositioning or risk management   |

---

### What Would Flip the Setup

There are a few clear tripwires that would suggest we’re moving out of a pinned regime and into something more dynamic:

1. **A decisive break and hold above $6.20** — if sustained with volume and accompanied by increasing GEX, this would likely force dealers to chase upward.
2. **A sharp rise in July or August call OI** — especially if it’s not paired with IV crush. That tells us smart money is paying up for convexity, not just riding flow.
3. **Unusual volume at $7.50 or $10.00** — particularly in low-delta contracts. These are often used as gamma ladders by funds preparing for acceleration moves.
4. **IV re-expansion across the curve** — signals the return of risk appetite, or the expectation of new information.

---

### The Way I See It

**The way I see it**, the options market right now is in a state of informed tension. The readout was positive, the Jefferies tone was confident, and price has responded accordingly. But the structure of the options chain — especially the positioning around $6.00 and the recent GEX flip — suggests that we’re in a holding pattern, not a momentum chase. At least not yet.

Next week is where that could change. If volume shifts upward, if the gamma profile steepens again, and if dealers are forced to re-hedge higher, the structure has the potential to resolve reflexively — and quickly. But if nothing changes, and the stock holds near $6.00 with IV slowly bleeding, we could be in for two more weeks of compression before June 20 hits.

Either way, the setup is active, and the signals are live.

---

## 7. Options - A Crystal Ball?

**The way I see it**, the $ATYR options chain right now is quietly telling a story that isn’t just about this week or this expiry — it’s about how the market is thinking across multiple time horizons. And to me, that story breaks into three layers: short-term structure, medium-term transition, and long-term re-pricing.

---

### A. Short-Term: Structurally Pinned, But One-Sided

From a short-term perspective, the options chain is congested but directional. The $6.00C positioning for June 20 is doing real work here. It’s acting like a gravitational centre — one that both traders and dealers are orbiting.

- Implied volatility remains elevated  
- Volume is active, but not euphoric  
- Dealer gamma is net positive, implying stability — but it won’t take much to flip

This is a classic **coiled structure** — not yet released, but increasingly sensitive to flow. If price moves cleanly above $6.00 with confirmation (volume, GEX acceleration, new OI at higher strikes), **I think** we could shift rapidly into a breakout regime. But until that happens, the default positioning remains stabilising, not amplifying.

In other words, the **risk-reward is asymmetrical from here** — not because the chain is screaming “squeeze,” but because the foundation for one is quietly being built.

---

### B. Medium-Term: Positioning for a Second Act

Looking further out, **I think** the July and August expiries are beginning to reflect a transition phase — not yet event-driven, but not just speculative either.

We’re seeing:

- OI gradually accumulating at $7.50C and $10.00C in both months  
- Consistently high implied volatility even out the curve  
- A persistent skew toward upside optionality, rather than downside protection

To me, this suggests a market that’s positioning for something beyond the immediate readout — possibly a commercial execution thesis, or anticipation of institutional follow-through on the back of upcoming milestones. There’s no guarantee that the Phase 3 readout itself will come in this window, but the chain is treating it as a live risk — and possibly a multi-week narrative.

If more call volume flows into these expiries next week, **I’ll take that as confirmation** that smart money is laddering exposure, not chasing momentum.

---

### C. Long-Term: Quiet Conviction in Asymmetry

The longer-dated expiries — January 2026 and 2027 — carry light volume, but meaningful signal. These contracts are priced for low-probability, high-magnitude outcomes, and yet the fact that they’re holding elevated IV and drawing OI at all tells me that someone is willing to carry long volatility here.

This isn’t retail lottery-ticket flow. These are the kinds of strikes that funds use when they want long-duration exposure to an inflection point — whether it’s Phase 3 success, M&A potential, or commercial buildout. They’re structurally long Vega, structurally convex, and they’re being bought without offsetting downside hedges.

To me, that reflects **confidence in a re-rating — not just a trade**.

---

### Final Thought

All things considered, **I think** this setup reflects a stock that is still early in its options story. The structural footprint is growing, but not saturated. The reflexive mechanics are active, but not yet disorderly. And the positioning tells me that the market is leaning bullish, but waiting for confirmation before chasing harder.

**In my view**, this is the kind of setup where price, sentiment, and positioning can align quickly — and when they do, it’s usually not a grind higher. It’s a repricing.

---

## 8. To Sum Up

The options chain for $ATYR is not just reflecting sentiment — it’s shaping it. Across the board, we’re seeing:

- A structurally loaded $6.00 strike acting as a pivot point in the June 20 expiry  
- A pronounced upside skew, with traders paying up for long convexity while largely ignoring downside hedges  
- A recent flip in gamma exposure, shifting dealer behaviour from volatility amplification to price stabilisation  
- Medium-term call building in July and August that signals expectations of further movement beyond the short-term OPEX window  
- Long-dated asymmetric call interest that suggests quiet institutional conviction in a much bigger move down the track  

**In my opinion**, the setup remains coiled, directional, and under-owned. If new flow comes in above $6.00 — particularly with volume clustering around $7.50 and $10.00 — we could see a structural shift in dealer hedging behaviour that opens the door to reflexive price action. Until then, we watch and wait. The chain is live, the signals are layered, and the mechanics are active.

1l4pjli,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1l4pjli/how_i_finally_found_a_meaningful_gift_for_my/,How I finally found a meaningful gift for my impossible-to-shop-for brother,"My brother turned 40 last month, and I was completely panicking about what to get him. He's always been the person who has everything - buys what he wants when he wants it, and has such specific tastes that gift cards feel like giving up.

We've always had this unspoken gift competition since childhood. Last year, he got me concert tickets to my favorite band with backstage passes. 

The year before, he tracked down a first edition of my favorite book. Meanwhile, I've been giving him... socks and whiskey stones. Not exactly winning the sibling gift wars.

This year, I was determined to find something meaningful. 

I started by listing his interests: fishing (has all the gear already), craft beer (his wife already got him a brewery tour), vintage records (impossible to know what he needs for his collection), and his job (he's really proud of his recent promotion to department head).

After weeks of dead ends, I remembered how he always keeps photos of family and friends on his desk at work. His office walls are covered with memories - fishing trips, family vacations, his wedding. That's when I had the idea to somehow capture one of those memories in a unique way.

I decided to try a custom bobblehead figure based on a photo from our fishing trip last summer. Found a place called [Bbobbler](http://www.bbobbler.com) that could create a personalized figure. I was honestly just hoping it wouldn't look terrible.

When it arrived, it was just one part of a larger gift I put together - a ""promotion celebration box"" with:

A bottle of his favorite bourbon

A handwritten letter about how proud I am of his career success

A custom leather keychain with his new title

A funny ""World's Okayest Department Head"" coffee mug

And the personalized bobblehead of him in his fishing gear

The bobblehead was actually the conversation starter that made the whole gift work. He laughed so hard when he saw it, especially because I had them make his nose slightly bigger (an ongoing joke between us).

The whole gift was a hit, but what really made it special was how everything connected to different parts of his life. His wife told me later that he brought the entire box to work to show his team.

Destaques positivos:

Cafés etíopes, da hyuga e da astral, particularmente preferi os da hyuga.

Astral torrefação: de forma geral, cafés muito bons e com preço justo, destaque especial para o estrela do patrick que foi um dos meus cafés de guerra pro dia a dia e é ótimo, e o pack yin-yang que tambem é muito bom.

Five roasters: Gabriel lamounier foi de longe o meu preferido, é um gesha que lembra os etíopes por um otimo valor (se não me engano foi 60$ ou 65$)

Tocaya: No geral uma das minhas favoritas, cafés de perfis mais limpos, que sao minha preferencia, e uma das melhores torras, talvez a com mais consistencia entre os grãos.

Destaques negativos:

Pato rei: de forma geral, os cafés tem um ponto de torra mais desenvolvidos que eu gostaria, são todos medio+ chegando no escuro, consistencia pessima nos grão, peneiras diferente, muitos graos queimados e muitos quakers.

Academia do café: os cafés tão muito longe de serem ruins, mas pelo preço (85$ por 180g) esperava mais.

The sun shone brightly on a January morning unlike any other. A vast army of reporters surrounded the United Nations, trying to get a glimpse of the event. But the guards fiercely defended the blockades as they became unruly, shouting, stretching their recording devices over the security limits. However, their desperation wasn’t without reason. The reporters tried to capture recordings of what might have been humanity's most vital gathering. Above them, spaceships carrying dignitaries from the United Planets, some humanoid and others who couldn’t be more different, soon landed in a designated area.

It was Daisy who provided the infrastructure for the historic gathering. After she and Carter defeated the Nemesis invasion, she was invited to a meeting of the Earth’s military powers, discussing how to fortify defenses in the contingency they return. Daisy proposed seeking help from the United Planets and even facilitated the initial meeting between Orion and the human leaders. It went well, but Orion was a military commander, not a politician. The finalization of their alliance would have to be between the human and off-worlder dignitaries.

Later that night, inside the building, the meeting room was halved with a blade of tension. The humans occupied one side and their alien counterparts on the other, and Damara stood in the middle, mediating.

”Oh, boy.” Daisy wiped the sweat off her brow.

Being a farmer by birth and a seamstress by trade, she had only the barest knowledge of politics. Daisy had spent weeks being tutored by advisers, finding it even more difficult than Everton’s combat training, but still, she was the only one both sides trusted.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have reached a fair arrangement. The humans will accept Orion Maximus as the supreme commander of the new arm.” Daisy took a deep breath. “But in turn, Carter Buchanan Barnes will be given the rank of general and all its authority. Are there any more issues or grievances you would like to discuss?""

Daisy looked between both sides, sweating a storm, waiting for their responses. But they both nodded to her question. And the delegates swiftly signed a treaty on a table. As they finished, Daisy grew a big smile.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I realize this arrangement is to fend off a common doom. But as we fight against oppression on the battlefield, I hope the bonds we make will stand the test of time. And lead our galaxy to an age of lasting peace and happiness.""

As they heard Daisy, a deafening silence swept the room to such a point one could hear a pin drop. Such a degree of sincerity like hers was exceedingly rare in the realm of politics. But it broke as they slowly gave a big round of applause.

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, Daisy and Carter entered an empty room with Orion, Lucas, and Sarah.

""Orion, now that everything is official, we should start making battle plans immediately,"" Daisy said.

Orion grew a smile.""Fear not. The second we received the word, the other generals and I arranged a meeting on planet Hachiko. So please relax and enjoy this time with your loved ones.""

Daisy gasped for air, clutching her chest, freed from a mighty burden. *""Sir, yes, sir.""* 

As Carter went to help, she kissed him, and the couple hastily began making out. With a small chuckle from Orion, he and Sarah quickly turned their gaze away from the couple. But Lucas instead burst out laughing.

""Fortis, you have the worst sense of humor.""

""Sarah, they're adorable like-""

Lucas looked at Sarah in her black dress and high-heeled shoes, blushing.""You.""

*""What?""*

""I've never seen you in a dress and high-heels before. I think I like it.""

Sarah blushed bright red back, and Orion chuckled as he saw them. But he soon stopped as he looked toward Daisy as a dire thought entered his mind.

""Daisy, have you told anyone but Carter about your dual identity?""

""No, sir. But I do plan on telling my family when I see them again. Is that okay?""

""Of course it is, but please, no one else. The more people know about this secret, the harder it will become to conceal. I don't even think it's safe to divulge it to the other generals.""

""You're worried about protecting the divinus from the Nemesis?""

""Yes. And I figured you would like some alone time now and again.""

Daisy cried tears of joy.""Yes, sir. Thank you.""

\*\*\*

A day later, Daisy and Carter returned to their home in Liberty City. Their home was a lavish apartment housed within one of Earth’s finest hotels. Every part of its one thousand and two hundred square feet was pristine. It had two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room with a beautiful couch in addition to other furnishings. Its floor was cleaned and polished to the point of a clear reflective surface. The room lived up to and even surpassed the hotel’s good name.

The couple lay in bed, snuggling right after making love in their apartment. Daisy wore a pink, short-trim silk nighty as Carter ran his hand through her silky hair. But as she was experiencing bliss, her eyes caught the sight of Everton’s pillow on the nightstand, and she grew a frown as she reached for it.

""Thank god those meetings are over. I was terrified I would say the wrong thing,"" Daisy held Everton’s pillow close to her heart.

""I'm right there with you, red. Fighting is one thing, but politics is something else.” Carter noticed Daisy holding the pillow frowning. “By the way, what's the story with that pillow? These days, you don’t go anywhere without it. And you always look so sad holding it.""

""It's a gift from the first Nemesis who showed me kindness. His name was Everton Blak. He protected me and showed me how to defend myself. And he even died saving me.” Daisy let out a deep sigh. “Carter, the man, was like a father to me. After all these years of being robbed of Pa's love, I got another. But I was too foolish to treasure it.""

""Wow, that's something.” Carter took a deep breath. “Now for my second question. Where exactly does the horse go in you when you're not Damara? Because I can think of several places that wouldn't be fun.""

Daisy burst out laughing.""Carter Barnes, I don't know how you do it, but you always cheer me up.""

""Great, I love seeing that smile."" Carter gently brushed his hand against Daisy’s cheek.

Daisy prepared to kiss Carter, but she stopped as an idea appeared in her mind, and her frown returned.

""I'll need you more than ever when we return from Hachiko. Oh god, I should have called my family earlier.""

""Daisy, don't beat yourself up. You had a thousand and one things on your plate."" Carter kissed Daisy.

“There’s that talent again.” Daisy grew a small smile.

\*\*\*

A United Planets spaceship flew across the galaxy to planet Hachiko. On the ship, Daisy helped Carter get dressed in front of the mirror in his cabin. She put the final touches on his black uniform with its long white cape on his clothes. But Carter looked at himself in the mirror, tightly gripping his mouth.

""Well, red, how do I look?""

""Quite handsome. But more importantly, like a respectable general.""

""I was thinking more like a fraud. I wish I never got this job.""

""Carter, there’s no one more qualified than you. So where is this coming from?""

""So many lives in my hands.” Carter took a deep breath. ”More people to lose if I make a mistake. More little boys that will grow up without a dad.""

Daisy looked at Carter quickly hugging him.""I know you'll do a splendid job, my love. It’ll be an honor to fight beside you.""

Carter cracked a small smile. ""Red, you cook, clean, and fight. What did I do to deserve you?""

Carter went in for a kiss, but Daisy quickly stopped him.

""What?"" Carter asked.

""I-I probably should have said this earlier. But we need to keep my secret. So, we must practice keeping our relationship quiet on missions. Starting now, no flirting, touching, or romance in any way.""

""Daisy, that's two weeks. You're killing me, but fine.""

Carter let out a groan but he soon gazed deeply at Daisy's body. Everything from her lips with red lipstick to, breasts, and butt made his heart pound like a drum.

""After this,"" Carter said.

Like lightning, Carter kissed Daisy with spirit. She tried to push him away but instead began enjoying it, clinging to Carter with an iron grip. As the couple stumbled toward his bed, he swiftly shoved Daisy onto it. And as he restrained her on the bed, Carter hastily had his way with her.

\*\*\*

Later, the spaceship landed on planet Hachiko. As Daisy and the others exited the vessel, they swiftly took in the glory of the alien world. A place of vast, open green meadows as far as the eye can see. Thousands of Lucas's kind, the Hachiko, littered the majestic landscape. Dog people of every breed lay down or ran through the meadows, filling the atmosphere with the sounds of life, loud shouting, chatter, and laughter as their sun bathed the land in golden rays. But one colossal shadow cast by a titanic white tower pierced the golden veil. And around it stood the only metropolis, solitary in the sea of the planet's natural beauty.

The metropolis was Camelot Alpha, the headquarters of the United Planets army. Carter’s militaristic mind was already scanning it for its defensibility in case of invasion. And he quickly noted how well-built it was, using the natural terrain to its advantage. It was like the fortress agreed with Hachiko, partitioning a portion of its surface, allowing it space to house the military without disrupting the natural landscape.

""Gorgeous. It makes me even more homesick for Kansas.""

""Thanks. War forced us to adopt a lot of new technology. But for the most part, we're still an agrarian society. We take great pride in our beautiful land.""

""Not to mention, the only obvious point of entry is through the secured front gate. And I bet your canine senses don't make sneak attacks any easier. No wonder Orion chose this place to be HQ,"" Carter said.

""He's the boss for a reason,"" Sarah said.

Carter looked around the area and spotted the Hachiko drawing carriages.

""Question. I get that you're a bunch of farmers, but why don't you employ some of that new technology in your transportation?""

Lucas let out a bark.""Because running through our fields makes us happy.""

""So, biology?""

Daisy giggled as she heard the men.""Carter, let's hurry to the meeting place before we're late. Sarah, Lucas, goodbye for now.""

Daisy waved to Sarah and Lucas goodbye, and she and Carter quickly left for their meeting.

""Well, Sarah, let's get to my village.""

Lucas hastily grew a smile, running toward the meadows, but Sarah caught him and hoisted him in the air. 

Sarah looked Lucas in the eye with an apathetic expression.""We're taking hover transport""

As Lucas heard Sarah, his smile disappeared, replaced with a growling frown.",1,1749207130.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

The United Planets soldiers rammed into the Nemesis forces with a fierce clash. Bodies flew over the battlefield as the two factions fought to control the divinus. 

Sarah stomped across the Nemesis army, but they retaliated with heavy plasma cannon fire, forcing the giantess back as they hit her shoulder.

As she saw the carnage, Daisy fell into a daze from being in the heat of war. Never before had she seen such concentrated death and violence. However, lost in thought, a Nemesis soldier hurried to decapitate her, but Everton pushed her out of harm's way. As the soldier attempted to slash him instead, Everton caught his blade, punched him, and threw his body at his comrades.

""Daisy, have you lost your senses?” Everton vigorously shook her, trying to break her free of her daze. “Forgotten what I taught you about a warrior's focus?""

""I'm sorry, but here's different from the Colosseum.""

*""You have no idea.""*

""U-understood. I won't hold anyone back.""

Daisy struggled to get to her feet. As she stood, plasma fire blasted her shield from her hand. She dashed for her weapon, seeing Nemesis soldiers incoming. As Everton went to help, a Nemesis soldier tackled him, knocking him away from her. The soldiers shot her hand as Daisy neared her shield. She dropped to the ground in pain. The enemy trained their guns to kill her, but before they could pull their triggers, Sarah crushed them with her giant hand.

""I tried to warn you, human. The shield is the weapon of losers. How are you supposed to injure or kill someone with one of those?""

Daisy giggled at Sarah’s remark but stopped as she spotted cannons aiming at her. ""Look out.""

The cannons hit Sarah in the face as she turned around to see what was coming. She crashed to the ground, barely conscious, shrinking back down. An obstacle came to block her path as Daisy ran to her aid. A Nemesis soldier elbowed her in the face, knocking her down. The soldier further attempted to stab her with his tyloblade, but she kicked him in the face as he pounced on her. 

Daisy quickly grabbed her shield, and as the soldier lunged to stab her again, landed a throat shot with it. The Nemesis soldier fell to the ground, dropping his blade. However, he quickly found a gun lying by the corpse of one of his fallen comrades and unloaded it on Daisy. Still, the young woman took refuge from the shots behind her shield.

Daisy charged at the soldier from behind her shield, ramming into him and pinning him to the ground. He scrambled for his gun, but she twisted his wrist. The weapon dropped. However, he flung her off, and she lost her grip on her shield as she hit the ground. Daisy and the soldier then spotted the gun on the ground. Without any other means of attack or defense, the gun was the key to victory in their duel. They both dived for it, but the soldier grabbed it first. Still, as he aimed it at Daisy, she punched him, making him drop it. 

Hastily, she took the gun, and before the soldier could do anything, she fired it, killing him.

""I-I did it.” Daisy slowly realized the consequences of her actions as the words left her mouth. “My god, I just killed someone.""

Daisy gazed at the soldier as he lay dead, and the reality hit her like a brick. The purest pale white slowly covered her face, and her trembling hand dropped the gun. Daisy forced down vomit as the world around her became a fuzzy mess. She staggered through the battlefield until she bumped into another Nemesis soldier. The soldier readied to kill with his sword. However, as he was about to impale her, Everton beat him with Daisy's shield.

""Everton, I killed someone. What have I done?""

""You went somewhere the kind and loving should never go, a killing field. You poor confused child, please forgive me for not keeping you away from here.""

\*\*\*

Elsewhere, the Nemesis forces forged a tight defensive line, protecting the fortress with the divinus. The combination of their superior numbers and powerful tanks rained terror upon the United Planets. The planets were like a force, though strong-willed and determined, weren’t unstoppable as they met an immovable object. The Nemesis slowly pushed their advance back, shoving their enemies closer and closer to defeat.

Gancelot slashed through hordes of Nemesis soldiers. Giant glowing cards mowed through them telekinetically directed by his hands like spinning saw blades across the battlefield. But he soon scanned around and saw his army crumbling, releasing a sigh and a bitter groan. The United Planets soldiers dropped like flies, and their dead bodies started to clutter the ground.

Gancelot activated his communicator, pressing a button on his wrist. ""United Planets, I am playing our trump card.""

As Gancelot gave his order, intense fear washed across the remaining United Planets soldiers. The soldiers quickly abandoned their advance, retreating as fast as possible away from the vice-commander. The healthy ran like the wind. Others carried their injured comrades at a desperate pace. 

As his forces were far enough away, Gancelot raised his hand, and his cards swiftly flew toward him, circling his body. He struck the ground with them, cutting across the land in a circular motion, carving out a great circle, and a titanic shockwave washed across the battlefield. All the Nemesis soldiers caught in the card's destructive path got swatted away like bugs. As he finished the circle, the colossal shockwave grew bigger and bigger, swallowing the battlefield and sending most of the enemy force flying in a monstrous dust devil.

Daisy and Everton were about to get caught in the strike, but Sarah grasped them with her giant hand. She clutched onto the ground, fighting against the herculean strength of the winds. As she struggled, Daisy’s eyes widened as far as they could go as she looked upwards, seeing legions of mighty Nemesis soldiers in the sky, falling helplessly to certain death.

Gancelot collapsed from his Herculean efforts. *""Attack with all we have left.""*

The United Planets soldiers took Gancelot's orders to heart. And they charged the remaining enemies with savage determination. However, as they gained momentum, a fleet of Nemesis ships appeared overhead, reinforcing the enemy. 

""Oh, no,"" Gancelot said, filling with despair.

The Nemesis ships rained plasma bolts on the United Planets soldiers, and as their infantry landed on the battlefield, they retreated again. Daisy, Everton, and Sarah looked on in horror from the onslaught. Still, Daisy noticed one of the bolts heading toward them.

*""Sarah, dodge.""*

Sarah spotted the attack and ran away. It missed her, but the shockwaves from its impact sent them all flying. And Daisy, Everton, and Sarah landed on the ground, barely conscious.

As Daisy struggled back to her feet, the ground started to shake. Swiftly, a massive crack formed from the plasma blast revealed a sewer system leading to the Nemesis fortress. 

""Everton, I think there's still a chance for us to win this. But I need you and Sarah's help.""

""Are you sure you can handle more of this carnage?""

With a moment of thought, Daisy nodded with a face of determination. Again, she believed she was ready. However, Daisy may have been truthful with herself this time. She was already free of a bit of her naivety, spending a short time on the battlefield. Still, the young woman held her beliefs in the sacredness of life, but now Daisy was pragmatic. Now, she knew running away from the killings would only prolong the defilement. Now, she understood the sacrifices she had to make in the present for the bright future she wanted.",1,1749207123.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

This adaptability is crucial in smaller homes where multifunctional spaces are a necessity. this modularity includes options for built-in storage and charging functionalities, further enhancing practicality.

**Sustainable Materials:** The growing concern for environmental responsibility is driving demand for furniture made from sustainable materials.

Manufacturers are increasingly utilizing recycled woods, bamboo, organic cotton, and plant-based foams.

Certifications such as FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and Oeko-Tex provide assurances of responsible sourcing and production practices.

**Smart Home Integration:** Smart furniture is becoming more prevalent, offering features like integrated lighting, wireless charging, and even temperature control.

The integration of voice control through platforms like Alexa or google Assistant enhances convenience, allowing you to manage your home habitat effortlessly.

**Space-Saving Designs:** In urban environments, maximizing space is paramount. Furniture designs are increasingly focused on efficiency and multifunctionality.

Ottomans with hidden storage, wall-mounted desks that fold away when not in use, and extendable dining tables are gaining popularity. These innovations help create clutter-free, organized living spaces without compromising on style or comfort. The clever use of vertical space through shelving units and wall-mounted cabinets further contributes to efficient space utilization.

1l4pd5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineersindia/comments/1l4pd5s/need_help_restarting_my_data_engineering_career/,Need help restarting my data engineering career after life threw me off track,"Hey everyone,
I never thought I’d be writing something this personal here, but I really need your support, guidance, and maybe a bit of hope.

A few years ago, I started my career as a data engineer. I was working at Cognizant, learning the ropes—SQL, ETL pipelines, SSIS/SSRS, Power BI. It wasn’t glamorous, and I won’t lie, I didn’t make the most of that opportunity. I was young and still figuring things out.

Then life hit me hard.

My mother was diagnosed with cancer. Everything else faded into the background. I quit my job not because I wanted to, but because I had to. I became her primary caregiver, and the hospital became my office. In those moments, data pipelines and dashboards didn’t matter. All I wanted was to give her the best care I could.

But bills don’t stop. So I started a small coffee business from scratch to cover our expenses. I sourced, packaged, built a brand, marketed it all without prior experience. It wasn’t easy, but it helped me stay afloat while giving my mom the care she needed. She’s better now, thankfully.

Fast forward to today. After 2+ years of pouring myself into the business, I’ve decided to shut it down because of some other constraints. I miss tech, I want to come back to data engineering but I’ve forgotten almost everything. It’s like I’m starting from scratch again.

So here I am, asking this amazing community if you were in my shoes, how would you restart your data engineering journey in 2025?

What tools, languages, and skills should I focus on first?

Are there free or affordable courses you’d recommend to rebuild my foundation or share if you have any courses?

How do I present this gap on my resume so it doesn’t overshadow my comeback?

And most importantly, how do I not lose hope?

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I don’t expect hand-holding, but any advice, roadmap, or words of encouragement would mean the world to me right now. I want to get back on my feet and make my mom proud.

Appreciate you all.

I did 4 or 5 tests with only water, but the hot water came out very yellowish a few times at the start. See the 2nd picture, you can guess which one is the heated water. The two glasses are identical.

After the last test, the color of the water ***seems*** normal, it's not yellow anymore.

However, I noticed that the rubber silicone at the end of the glass water pipe turned yellow.

At first, I figured they’d just gotten greedy: raising prices to boost profits and maybe cutting costs by hiring less experienced roasters. I started thinking it might be time to find a new roaster.

But then I looked up arabica bean futures prices, and turns out they’ve gone up over 60% in the past year. So yeah… my roaster is fully exonerated now. Seems like they’ve been forced to switch to cheaper (and worse-tasting) beans just to avoid scaring off ignorant customers like me with a full 60% price hike.



What about your roaster? Have they raised prices to match the bean market, or are they cutting quality to keep prices “reasonable”?",0,1749206796.0,espresso,8,0.39,False

1l4p5lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Custody/comments/1l4p5lp/fl_reintroducing_parent_after_7_years/,[FL] Reintroducing parent after 7 years,"
Hello! 
My ex an I separated 9 years ago, legally divorced for 7. Our son was 2 at the time the divorce was final and that was the last time he saw our son in person, prior to that he was about a year old when he moved away to a different state and didn’t visit. 

For 7 years, he was in the military. Stationed in 2 different states. Did not take any leave time that resulted in visiting his child. So during this time it was a FaceTime call somewhat weekly. Ranging in 10minuted to maybe an hour (when it was long there wasn’t conversation the whole time, it was more “watch me play a game or watch a show” type thing).

As of January, he has now relocated back to the same town we are in. I sat down with him and explained that the process of timesharing and reintroducing him to my son’s life would be very slow and we needed to ensure he was confident and comfortable during the changes. 

We started off with just short visits at a coffee shop every other week. My son was visibly nervous and unsure. I kept checking in to see how he was feeling and kept the door open for questions. His birthday was during this time, never did my son ask to plan anything to include his dad, but during the weekend we did a visit when his father asked just a couple days prior to the birthday. 

Now we have moved to a park setting to allow a little more freedom and room for activity. We are going to also start doing this weekly for a couple hours

My son has stated that he isn’t comfortable with me not being there as of right now, but maybe could try a couple hours at a time in a little while as long as he knew ahead of time I wouldn’t be there (he’s a planner and wants to know what to expect to feel ok with change). I told him that is fine, but to ensure to also express this to his father the next time we visit so he hears it and will understand the pace we are at.
I dod ask him how he would possibly feel for longer times on the weekend, and that we could down the road consider a weekend with his dad and then a weekend with me, rotating. He said he was not comfortable with that idea and doesn’t want to be forced into a schedule or visits that he’s not ready for.


My question is….. how do you move forward at a pace that is right for your child after someone being absent for so long? I want to keep this out of court so there isn’t a forced schedule as I have all decision making and timeshare as agreed to by the parties. His dad has only asked to transition from the coffee shop to the park, not asking for additional calls other that the weeks we didn’t visit. And he’s not asked to increase the frequency of visits.

The father has never asked about our child randomly to check in, sent extra funds or gifts for things. Even when he knew he was sick, didn’t check in to see how he was. He has changed jobs twice since February and know has more of a consistent schedule. I did discover he reopened the case with a form that could potentially ask for modification of the parenting/timeshare agreement…. I’m nervous that he is going to try and force a schedule through the court before taking into consideration where our son is at emotionally with changes. I do know he’s one to go for child support modification and that is the only thing he’s mentioned before, he hasn’t mentioned seeking more timeshare. 

Help with anyone who has gone through this and what is the best approach to have a schedule that fits my son’s pace and keeping us out of a court order!!!

I also started a new job this week on Monday, which brought onboarding-related stress and social anxiety due to adapting to a new team environment.

Current Intervention:

For the past three weeks, I’ve been taking pure L-Glutamine powder to support gut health, particularly for managing gastritis and bloating.

Observed Improvements (since 2 weeks):

•	⁠improvement in lower-body blood flow (LBF) - i can feel there is blood flow
•	⁠Sleep quality has improved noticeably
•	⁠Heart rate variability (HRV) has increased, indicating reduced physiological stress (I always had an HVR around 40, now climbing to 55, still increasing)
•	⁠Perceived stress levels have gone down
•	⁠General sense of well-being and relaxation has improved - Enhanced mood and emotional stability
•	⁠Low back pain (mostly in the morning i woke up from this) is gone

Sexual and Urological Improvements (since 1 week):

•	⁠Consistent morning and nocturnal erections (still not very rigid but present)
•	⁠Penile temperature is normalized (no longer cold)
•	⁠No burning sensation during ejaculation
•	⁠Erection quality during masturbation has improved (faster engorgement, increased rigidity, longer erections when stopping touching)
•	⁠Flaccid penile appearance is slightly fuller and not so overly disgusting thin and long any more
•	⁠no more occasionally mild pressure/pain on the right side of the penis shaft
•	⁠Flaccid penis still appears veiny or constricted but far less often
•	⁠I go way less to the toilet to pee, and my bladder feels somewhat more empty
•	⁠no more waking up and directly have to go to the toilet to pee
•	⁠far less feeling of urge to urinate in the penis, now I can feel somewhat that I have to pee in my bladder and not only at the external sphincter
•	⁠way less post urination dribble
- base of penis appears a little less wobbly during erected 
- glans fills up completely for a short time while erected 

Remaining Issues (Not Yet? Improved):

•	⁠Persistently weak and slow urinary stream
•	⁠Ongoing torsion or twist at the base of the penis
•	⁠post orgasm coldness in the penis for some hours

I never had:

•	⁠issues with digestion (no constipation or diarrhea)
•	⁠scrotal pain

Relevant Lifestyle Factors / Biases:

- Finished PhD 4 days ago → extremely high stress prior to that
- Stopped workouts recently but now cycle consistently every weekday (9 km) on top of my free time rides
- Walking increased since monday: from ~6,000–8,000 to now 10,000–15,000 steps daily
- Drastically reduced vaping since Monday and caffeine (from 4-8 cups of coffee to 1-2 cups) and for two weeks no coffee at all (while gastritis).

Theory:

I suspect that I may have leaky gut, SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), SIFO (small intestinal fungal overgrowth), or a combination of these. This could be causing chronic low-grade inflammation in the gut.
That hidden inflammation might trigger a reflex tension in the pelvic floor muscles with incorporation of the prostate through the gut–brain connection and the autonomic nervous system. This muscle tension could explain the symptoms.

Short version of the possible chain:

→ Gut inflammation → prostate irritation and nervous system irritation → pelvic floor tension → blood flow + urinary + sexual symptoms

A little over a year ago, I met a man through a local hiking group. He was 58, kind, funny, had his own business, owned a home, no major baggage that I could see. We started dating slowly. Coffee turned into dinners, dinners turned into weekends at his place. He always texted good morning. Always walked me to my car. I hadn’t dated in a few years, and it felt nice to be seen again.

But from the beginning, there were little things I kept brushing off. I’d never met his kids. He’d never met mine. He didn’t like to plan more than a few days out. I asked once if he wanted to take a short trip with me. He said travel stressed him out. I said okay. We stayed local.

The turning point came last month when I spent a full weekend at his house. It was supposed to be relaxing. Instead, I felt like a guest he didn’t really want there. His routines were set in stone. He made his breakfast, watched the news, did yard work, and didn’t ask me to join or offer to include me. I sat at the kitchen table reading a book for most of Saturday. We barely spoke. He wasn’t unkind, just... detached. That night, we watched a movie in silence and went to bed early. Sunday morning, he said, ""You’re welcome to stay longer if you want,"" but didn’t look up from his phone.

Driving home, I realized something. That wasn’t just a quiet weekend. That was a preview. That’s what my life would look like if I stayed with him. Parallel lives. Separate routines. No real partnership. I’d spent the whole weekend feeling like furniture in someone else’s house.

So I ended it. No big fight. No drama. He said he was surprised but that he respected my decision. I cried afterward. Not because I missed him, but because it hit me how easy it is to fall into something that looks safe but leaves you feeling invisible.

At 55, I don’t need someone to fix my problems or complete me. But I want to feel like I’m sharing a life with someone, not just passing time next to them. I want someone who looks across the table and says, ""I’m glad you’re here,"" not someone who barely notices when I’m gone.

### **Introduction\: The Myth of the \""Digital Nomad\"" Age**

You\'ve seen the photos — young faces in Bali\, laptops open in a beachside café\, sipping coconuts like they\'re champagne\. You might think that the digital nomad life is reserved for the fresh\-out\-of\-college crowd\. But that’s not just outdated — it’s dangerous thinking\. Age has no bearing on your ability to build a location\-independent career\. In fact\, age can be one of your greatest assets\.

Let’s dismantle this myth once and for all\.

---

### **The Rise of the Modern Nomadic Lifestyle**

Remote work isn’t new\. What is new is how accessible it has become\. Thanks to cloud computing\, video conferencing\, and global payment systems\, anyone with a laptop and internet can work from anywhere\. This shift didn’t happen overnight — it was years in the making\. And it opened the floodgates for people of all ages to chase freedom over tradition\.

But if you’re not part of the 20\-something demographic\, don’t feel left out\. The world is changing faster than ever\, and so are the rules\.

---

### **Age Isn\'t a Limit — It\'s a Launchpad**

Think about it\: Why would youth have a monopoly on ambition\? If anything\, experience brings clarity\. You know what you want\, you’ve built skills\, and you understand the value of time\. That’s not something most 22\-year\-olds can say\.

Your age doesn’t define your potential\. It defines your perspective\. And right now\, the world needs more perspectives — not less\.

---

### **Why 25 to 35 is the Most Common Demographic**

Yes\, there’s a reason why most digital nomad communities skew younger\. People in their early careers are often more adaptable\, risk\-tolerant\, and unburdened by financial obligations\. That’s not to say they’re better suited for the lifestyle — just more available for it\.

But don’t mistake availability for capability\. You don’t need to be free of responsibilities to live a life of purpose\.

---

### **The Under\-25 Nomads\: Young\, Restless\, and Ready to Earn**

This group is growing fast\. High school graduates\, college dropouts\, and recent grads are embracing remote work before traditional employment even comes into play\. For them\, the digital nomad lifestyle is both a rebellion and a revolution\.

They’re building empires on TikTok\, launching SaaS startups at 19\, and turning passion projects into full\-time incomes\. But let’s not romanticize youth — it comes with its own set of challenges\.

---

### **The Over\-35 Nomads\: Experience as Your Passport**

If you\'re in your late 30s or beyond\, you may have heard the whispers\: “Too old\,” “Shouldn’t you be settling down\?” Ignore them\. You’ve got decades of knowledge\, a network of contacts\, and the wisdom to navigate uncertainty\.

This is when many professionals begin to question the 9\-to\-5 grind\. And that questioning is powerful\. It leads to action\. To change\. To freedom\.

---

### **Breaking Stereotypes\: Digital Nomads in Their 40s and Beyond**

Here’s the truth\: You’re never too old to start something new\. Whether you’re transitioning careers\, retiring early\, or simply tired of being stuck in one place\, the digital nomad lifestyle offers a way forward\.

And contrary to popular belief\, older nomads bring stability\, insight\, and a level of professionalism that younger ones often lack\. You’re not chasing trends — you’re setting them\.

---

### **The Hidden Trend\: Older Adults Embracing Remote Work**

While Gen Z and Millennials dominate the headlines\, an unexpected wave is rising among Baby Boomers and Gen Xers\. These individuals are leveraging their skills and expertise to create passive income streams\, launch consulting businesses\, or mentor others online\.

This trend is quiet but powerful\. It’s proof that age is not a barrier — it’s a bridge to opportunity\.

---

### **Education vs\. Experience in the Nomadic World**

One of the biggest misconceptions about digital nomads is that they must have degrees in tech\, marketing\, or design\. But real\-world experience counts just as much — if not more\.

Whether you’re a former teacher\, a military veteran\, or a small business owner\, your background gives you unique insights and strengths\. The digital nomad world values adaptability\, creativity\, and hustle far more than a piece of paper\.

---

### **Gender and Age\: How They Intersect in the Digital Nomad Sphere**

Women in their 40s and 50s are breaking barriers in the digital nomad community\. They’re starting blogs\, coaching programs\, and online courses — all while managing families and personal lives\.

Men\, on the other hand\, are increasingly choosing to slow down\, travel with their partners\, and redefine success on their own terms\.

This shift is reshaping the narrative around who gets to live a nomadic lifestyle\.

---

### **Location Independence and Career Stage**

Where you are in your career path matters — but not in the way you think\. Early\-career nomads are often experimenting\, trying different models\, and figuring out what works\. Mid\-career nomads are usually refining strategies and scaling up\.

No matter where you are\, the key is to align your goals with your current stage\. Be strategic\. Be bold\. Be selective\.

---

### **Financial Freedom vs\. Financial Responsibility**

Let’s talk money\. One of the biggest concerns for older digital nomads is financial security\. Will I have enough\? Can I afford healthcare\? How do I save\?

These are valid questions — and they require answers\. But they also mean you’re thinking long\-term\. That’s a good thing\. Financial responsibility is the backbone of sustainable freedom\.

---

### **The Role of Technology in Shaping Nomadic Ages**

From blockchain to AI\, technology is leveling the playing field\. It allows older workers to stay competitive\, younger ones to break into markets quickly\, and everyone in between to collaborate globally\.

You don’t need to be tech\-savvy to benefit from this shift — just open\-minded and willing to learn\.

---

### **The Impact of Globalization on Age Diversity Among Nomads**

As the world becomes more interconnected\, so does the digital nomad community\. People from every age group and cultural background are finding ways to work remotely\.

This diversity enriches the experience for everyone involved\. It fosters innovation\, empathy\, and understanding — all critical traits for a successful nomadic life\.

---

### **Parenting While Nomading\: A New Frontier**

Raising kids in a nomadic lifestyle used to be unthinkable\. Not anymore\. Families are traveling the globe together\, working from coffee shops\, and creating unconventional yet fulfilling lives for their children\.

This trend is redefining what it means to be a parent in the 21st century\. It’s messy\, it’s challenging\, but it’s also incredibly rewarding\.

---

### **Health and Wellness in a Wandering Life**

Nomading isn’t all beaches and Wi\-Fi\. It requires discipline — especially when it comes to health\. From sleep schedules to nutrition\, staying healthy while constantly on the move is no small feat\.

But it’s possible\. And it starts with intention\. With consistency\. With self\-awareness\.

---

### **Mental Resilience and Emotional Maturity**

Living without a fixed address takes more than just a suitcase and a passport\. It demands mental toughness\, emotional intelligence\, and the ability to roll with the punches\.

Older nomads often excel in these areas\. They’ve weathered storms\, made mistakes\, and learned from them\. That resilience is invaluable in a life full of uncertainty\.

---

### **Building a Legacy Without Roots**

Many people associate legacy with property\, possessions\, and permanence\. But a true legacy is built through impact — through the lives you touch\, the ideas you share\, and the freedom you inspire in others\.

And that kind of legacy knows no age limit\.

---

### **The Future of the Nomadic Workforce**

We’re only scratching the surface of what’s possible\. As more industries embrace remote work\, the definition of a digital nomad will continue to evolve\.

This future is inclusive\. Diverse\. Dynamic\. And it’s waiting for you — no matter your age\.

---

### **Conclusion\: Age Is Just a Number — So Is Location**

So\, how old is the average digital nomad\? The answer is simple\: There is no average\.

What matters is your mindset\, your drive\, and your willingness to step outside the box\. Whether you’re 22 or 62\, the world is yours to explore — and your potential is limitless\.

Now go out there and claim it\.

I’m in the market for a new laptop mainly for UX work — think Figma, prototyping, light photo editing, research, and documentation (emails, reports, the usual). I’ve been eyeing Mac laptops because of all the good reviews on battery life and reliability — two things you can’t mess around with when you’re constantly moving between home, coffee shops, and out-of-town work setups.

Before I pull the trigger though, I’d love to hear your thoughts — Mac or non-Mac, baka may ma-recommend kayo na better or more sulit for a UX designer.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

Long battery life (non-negotiable — can’t be hunting for outlets mid-project)

Reliable performance (smooth multitasking — Figma tabs, Notion docs, Asana tasks, AI tools, all running at once)

Portability (I’m often out working in coffee shops or traveling outside Manila, so nothing too heavy)

Budget: Flexible, but preferably not over 60K PHP


If you’ve had a great experience with a Mac or a Windows laptop that can rival it in battery and performance, I’d really love to hear your recommendations!

Side note: I’m also thinking of getting an iPad since there’s an app called Mockup that’s only available on Mac/iOS. So a Mac might make more sense? 🤔

i stopped drinking soda because with soda it was almost every time i drank it that it would hurt but with coffee it wasn't super often and the heart pain was mostly minor and more uncomfortable than like actually hurting me so i haven't done anything about it since it didn't affect me too much and my doctor wasn't concerned about it.

however lately it's gotten worse and instead of just the weird heart pain i feel like i can't breathe but it's a weird type of can't breathe. its not really like i'm having an allergic reaction but more like i'm having an anxiety or panic attack.

i don't really like going to the doctor cause most of the time when i bring up any concerns it ends up being nothing so i was just wondering if this is normal for being weak to caffeine or if it could be something serious. i'm kinda already set on cutting out coffee but any advice is appreciated!!",2,1749205439.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

The sounds hit you next – a melodic mix of Spanish conversations, honking cars, and distant music that seems to pulse through the very streets. That was my first moment in South America three years ago, and honestly? I haven't been the same since.

South America isn't just a destination – it's a feeling. It's the continent where ancient civilizations whisper their secrets through stone walls, where nature shows off in the most spectacular ways imaginable, and where every meal feels like a celebration. Whether you're drawn to the mystical energy of Machu Picchu, the infectious rhythm of Rio's beaches, or the raw beauty of Patagonian glaciers, this continent delivers experiences that stick with you long after you've returned home.

If you're planning your South American adventure for 2025, you've picked an incredible time to visit. The continent is experiencing a tourism renaissance, with improved infrastructure, exciting new accommodations, and a renewed focus on sustainable travel that benefits local communities. Let me share everything I've learned about making the most of your South American journey.

# The Must-Visit Destinations That Will Blow Your Mind

South America spans 12 countries, each offering completely different vibes and experiences. Here's where you absolutely need to go:

# Peru: Where Ancient Meets Adventure

**Peru** is hands-down the crown jewel for first-time South America visitors. Yes, everyone talks about Machu Picchu, and yes, it absolutely lives up to the hype. But Peru is so much more than one (admittedly incredible) archaeological site.

**Lima** has transformed into a world-class culinary destination – seriously, the food scene here rivals Paris or Tokyo. The historic center is gorgeous, and neighborhoods like Miraflores offer stunning clifftop views of the Pacific Ocean. **Cusco** feels like stepping into a living museum where Incan walls support colonial buildings, and the Sacred Valley surrounding it is dotted with market towns and ancient ruins that see far fewer crowds than Machu Picchu.

Don't sleep on **Arequipa** either – this white stone city sits in the shadow of three volcanoes and serves as your gateway to the Colca Canyon, where condors soar on thermals and the scenery will leave you speechless.

# Brazil: Rhythm, Beaches, and Raw Nature

**Brazil** is like five countries rolled into one massive, beautiful package. **Rio de Janeiro** embodies everything you imagine about Brazil – the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana, the Christ the Redeemer statue watching over the city, and a nightlife scene that doesn't quit. The energy here is absolutely infectious.

But venture beyond Rio and you'll discover the colonial gem of **Salvador**, where Afro-Brazilian culture creates an intoxicating mix of music, food, and art. For nature lovers, the **Amazon rainforest** accessible from Manaus offers wildlife encounters you'll never forget, while **Ilha Grande** provides that perfect tropical island escape without the crowds.

# Argentina: Tango, Steaks, and Endless Landscapes

**Buenos Aires** is often called the ""Paris of South America,"" and after spending a week there, I completely get why. The architecture is stunning, the tango shows are mesmerizing, and the steaks – oh my god, the steaks. This is a city where dinner doesn't start until 10 PM and the nights stretch until dawn.

**Patagonia** represents Argentina's wild side. Whether you're trekking in El Calafate near the Perito Moreno Glacier or exploring the wine country around Mendoza, Argentina offers landscapes that range from cosmopolitan sophistication to edge-of-the-world adventure.

# Colombia: The Rising Star of South America

**Colombia** has completely transformed over the past decade and is now one of South America's safest and most exciting destinations. **Cartagena** feels like a fairytale with its colorful colonial buildings and Caribbean vibe, while **Bogotá** has evolved into a cultural powerhouse with incredible museums, street art, and what many consider South America's best emerging food scene.

Reddit travelers consistently rank Colombia as their top recommendation for 2025, and I completely agree. The **coffee region** around Medellín offers stunning landscapes and some of the world's best coffee tours, while the **Pacific Coast** remains largely untouched by mass tourism.

# Ecuador: Small Country, Big Adventures

Don't let **Ecuador's** size fool you – this little country packs an incredible punch. **Quito** sits high in the Andes with a UNESCO World Heritage historic center that rivals any European capital. But the real star is the **Galápagos Islands**, where you can snorkel with sea lions, spot giant tortoises, and witness evolution in action.

The **Amazon basin** from Ecuador offers some of the most accessible wildlife viewing in South America, while the volcanic **Avenue of the Volcanoes** provides hiking opportunities with some of the continent's most dramatic backdrops.

# Chile: Land of Extremes

**Chile** stretches from the driest desert on Earth to some of the most dramatic fjords you'll ever see. The **Atacama Desert** offers otherworldly landscapes and some of the clearest skies for stargazing anywhere on the planet. **Patagonia** provides hiking that rivals anywhere in the world, while **Santiago** serves as a sophisticated base with world-class museums and easy access to both mountains and coastline.

# Bolivia: Otherworldly Landscapes on a Budget

**Bolivia** remains South America's best-kept secret for budget travelers. The **Salar de Uyuni** salt flats create mirror-like reflections during rainy season that photographers dream about, while **La Paz** offers one of the most unique capital city experiences in the world, sitting at over 11,000 feet above sea level.

# Where to Rest Your Head: Accommodation Options for Every Budget

# Budget Picks: Hostels and Guesthouses ($10-30/night)

South America's hostel scene is legendary among backpackers. In major cities like Lima, Buenos Aires, and Bogotá, you'll find hostels with everything from basic dorms to private rooms with ensuite bathrooms. Many include breakfast, have communal kitchens, and organize group activities that make meeting fellow travelers easy.

**Pro tip**: Book hostels through HostelWorld, but always check the hostel's direct website too – sometimes they offer better rates for direct bookings.

# Mid-Range Comfort: Boutique Hotels and B&Bs ($40-120/night)

This is the sweet spot for most travelers. Countries like Peru and Ecuador offer charming boutique hotels in converted colonial buildings, while Argentina and Chile provide excellent mid-range accommodations with modern amenities. Many include breakfast and offer tour booking services.

**Standout recommendation**: Ananay Hotels in Peru has opened new boutique properties in Cusco and Arequipa that perfectly blend luxury with local character.

# Luxury Escapes: World-Class Resorts and Unique Stays ($150+/night)

South America's luxury scene has exploded in recent years. From overwater bungalows in Brazil to luxury eco-lodges in the Amazon, you can find accommodations that rival anywhere in the world. Patagonia's luxury lodges offer incredible wildlife viewing with five-star comfort, while urban luxury hotels in Buenos Aires and São Paulo provide world-class service.

# Experiences That'll Give You Chills: Tours and Adventures

# Cultural Immersion Experiences

Skip the basic city tours and dive deeper. In Lima, take a cooking class that includes a market visit where you'll learn about ingredients you've never heard of. In Colombia, participate in coffee harvest experiences where you'll work alongside local farmers. The Shipibo people near Lima offer art workshops that provide insight into Amazonian culture while supporting indigenous communities.

# Adventure Activities

South America is an adrenaline junkie's paradise. **Hiking the Inca Trail** remains a bucket-list experience, but consider alternatives like the Salkantay Trek or Choquequirao for fewer crowds. **Patagonia** offers world-class trekking in both Chile and Argentina, while **white-water rafting** in Ecuador and **sandboarding** in Peru provide unique thrills.

# Wildlife Encounters

The **Galápagos Islands** offer the most famous wildlife viewing, but don't overlook the **Amazon** for incredible biodiversity. **Pantanal** in Brazil provides better wildlife spotting than the Amazon, while **Península Valdés** in Argentina offers whale watching that rivals anywhere in the world.

# A Foodie's Paradise: What to Eat and Where

# Must-Try Dishes by Country

**Peru**: Ceviche, lomo saltado, and pisco sours are just the beginning. Try anticuchos (grilled beef heart skewers) from street vendors and don't miss causa, a layered potato dish that showcases Peru's incredible potato diversity.

**Argentina**: Beyond the famous steaks, try empanadas, choripán, and dulce de leche everything. Each region has its own empanada style – sampling them becomes a delicious journey across the country.

**Brazil**: Feijoada (black bean stew), açaí bowls, and coxinha (chicken croquettes) represent Brazil's diverse culinary landscape. Don't miss regional specialties like moqueca in Salvador.

**Colombia**: Arepas, bandeja paisa, and ajiaco showcase Colombian comfort food at its finest. The emerging fine dining scene in Bogotá rivals any major city.

# Street Food Culture

South American street food is safe, delicious, and incredibly affordable. Look for busy stalls with high turnover – that's your sign of freshness. **Anticuchos** in Peru, **salteñas** in Bolivia, and **choripán** in Argentina represent some of the continent's best quick eats.

# Fine Dining and Emerging Food Scenes

Lima's fine dining scene has put South America on the global culinary map, with restaurants like Central and Maido consistently ranking among the world's best. Bogotá's food scene is experiencing incredible growth, while Buenos Aires offers world-class steakhouses alongside innovative contemporary cuisine.

# Getting Around: Transportation Made Simple

# Flying Between Countries

**LATAM** and **Avianca** offer the most comprehensive route networks within South America. Book flights well in advance for better prices, and consider multi-city tickets if you're visiting multiple countries.

# Overland Travel

Bus travel in South America is comfortable, affordable, and scenic. Companies like **Cruz del Sur** in Peru and **Andesmar** in Argentina offer luxury bus services with fully reclining seats and meal service. Border crossings are generally straightforward, but always carry physical copies of important documents.

# Local Transportation

**Uber** operates in major cities throughout South America and is often safer and more convenient than taxis. In cities like Medellín and Buenos Aires, metro systems are efficient and affordable. For rural areas, local buses provide authentic experiences and access to remote destinations.

# Money Matters: What You'll Actually Spend

# Daily Budget Breakdown

**Budget travelers**: $25-40/day including accommodation, food, and local transport **Mid-range travelers**: $50-80/day with comfortable hotels and occasional splurges **Luxury travelers**: $150+/day for high-end accommodations and experiences

# Money-Saving Tips

* Eat lunch at local markets for authentic food at fraction of restaurant prices
* Use overnight buses to save on accommodation costs
* Book accommodations with kitchen access to prepare some of your own meals
* Take advantage of free walking tours in major cities
* Visit museums on free admission days

# When to Splurge

Invest in quality for once-in-a-lifetime experiences like **Galápagos cruises**, **Amazon lodge stays**, and **Machu Picchu tours**. These experiences justify the higher cost through expert guides and unique access.

# Staying Safe and Respectful: Local Etiquette and Safety Tips

# Safety Essentials

South America is generally very safe for tourists who take common-sense precautions. Avoid displaying expensive electronics, don't walk alone late at night in major cities, and trust your instincts. Keep copies of important documents separate from originals, and register with your embassy in countries with higher risk levels.

# Cultural Do's and Don'ts

* **Do** learn basic Spanish phrases – locals appreciate the effort
* **Don't** wear expensive jewelry or watches
* **Do** tip 10% in restaurants where service charge isn't included
* **Don't** refuse offered food or drink – it's considered rude
* **Do** dress conservatively when visiting religious sites

# Solo Travel Considerations

South America is excellent for solo travelers, with extensive hostel networks and tour groups that make meeting people easy. Women should take extra precautions in certain areas, but millions of solo female travelers visit South America safely every year.

# Timing is Everything: When to Visit

# Climate and Seasons

South America's size means seasons vary dramatically by region. **High season** (December-March) is summer below the equator, perfect for Patagonia but rainier in the Amazon. **Shoulder seasons** (April-May, September-November) offer the best combination of good weather and fewer crowds.

# Festival Calendar

* **Carnival** (February/March): Rio's carnival is world-famous, but consider alternatives in Salvador or Oruro, Bolivia
* **Inti Raymi** (June): Cusco's sun festival brings Incan traditions to life
* **Day of the Dead** (November): Experience unique celebrations throughout the continent

# Crowd Levels and Peak Times

**June-August** sees the highest tourist numbers in Peru and Ecuador due to dry weather. **December-February** brings crowds to Argentina and Chile. Plan accordingly or visit during shoulder seasons for better prices and fewer tourists.

# Final Thoughts: Your South American Adventure Awaits

South America changed my perspective on travel completely. It's a continent that challenges you, inspires you, and welcomes you with open arms. Every country offers enough experiences for an entire trip, so don't try to see everything – instead, choose a few destinations and really immerse yourself in them.

The beauty of South America lies not just in its incredible landscapes or fascinating history, but in its people. You'll find warmth and hospitality that makes every interaction memorable, from the market vendor who insists you try her favorite fruit to the hostel owner who draws you a hand-drawn map of his favorite local spots.
