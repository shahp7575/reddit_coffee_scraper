Long story short, I take 20mg Vyvanse when I really need to focus, it kinda helps but nothing like day 1, and I do generic Ridalyn on other days, and coffee.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1il64ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1il64ul/the_little_things/,The little things,"How do I get my (25F) husband (24M) to care about the little gestures I want him to do.

I feel like my husband doesn‚Äôt reciprocate. I wish sometimes when he knew I was having a hard day or a tough week he tried to do some of the same things for me. He doesn‚Äôt even know my favourite meals or my coffee order. I want him to notice the things that he could help me with to take stress off my plate. 

He feels like I have been really critical of him lately. To be fair I have been so emotional after a recent miscarriage and I have had higher needs. But This is building up and bothering me but I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up without him thinking I am just really critical.

Cant afford lavish lifestyle. Wtf do i do.","I think im fat so i dont want to eat because it will just be something unhealthy and make me fatter

No foods sound good, its all boring ive had it all 500000000000002 times and nothing is ever fun or exciting or new or actually good, its just food. ‚ÄúChoice paralysis‚Äù was something my psychiatrist brought to my attention is a thing and i most definitely struggle with it daily. 

The only cravings i have gotten in years are for things like chips, or pancakes, or cheese. 

Eating healthy is constantly on my mind, getting enough protein as well. I usually binge on sugar and make myself feel sick at times from over doing it. 

I just feel like i need a personal chef who is well versed in cooking healthy, flavorful, beautiful, specific amounts of calories/carbs/protein/fats for daily living, and will take payments in just eating the food that they make. 

I dont like eat in public or with/around people unless they are people im very very very comfortable with and the food is also easy to bite/chew/isnt messy/embarrassing/ going to be a lot of work/etc. 

I have body dysmorphia and hate everything about myself a majority of the time. My face and my stomach and my arms and my back and pretty much just all of it is a constant hate/rage battle and i wish i had more energy/motivation to exercise and make my body as strong as it once used to be, but also more fit looking and over all just be in better health and look better, not even for anyone else, but me personally.
I want to feel like i know what im doing and i just dont.

I dont know what I like, not even just surrounding food. 
There are things i could say i do like but overall it gets lost in my 500 lists of ‚Äúsafe foods‚Äù ive tried to make for when im starving and have no idea what to feed myself. 
Even when i dont care and say fuck it i‚Äôll be fat forever and i‚Äôll just eat whatever, nothing. Ever. Sounds. Good. 

Its just fuel and to make my body stop hurting.
Ive been in the emergency room because of gastritis pains, from just having diet of: alcohol, only eating pretty spicy food, water with a shit ton of lemon, hUgE cups of black coffee, smoking like 24/7, just barely eating overall/was too much acid in my stomach i guess. Has happened multiple times in the past and that is a level of pain i dont wish on anyone. 

Im starting to slip back into my habits of not eating hardly at all, over doing the black coffee /on empty stomach, spicy food, but im not smoking nor am i really drinking alcohol at all so thats gotta be good right? 

I really dont want to be like this anymore but i cant see myself in my life having any difference without someone coming along and holding my hand in a grocery store and picking out every item my body needs to thrive and survive and just make me a schedule for eating times/cooking it for me, etc. 


I dont even know why im making this, im just tired and i want to get better but i dont know how to cook, and i am very poor, have terrible social anxiety around anything surrounding food & people. 

I could go on many different tangents revolving around food for days, all ehile avoiding making myself having to eat a meal. 

Im sorry is this is triggering for anyone in any way. I just needed to get these things out. 

Yes we have to eat to survive but there has got to be some kind of way to get around that‚Ä¶.. maybe???? Idk
Again im sorry.

1il5wkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1il5wkh/fall_out_with_my_gc_sister/,Fall out with my GC sister,"I had a big fight with my sister, with whom I'm supposed to be close. She was the ""golden child"" in our family, while I was the ""scapegoat."" As expected, she had a very different life than me. It wasn't until we were adults that she believed me that our mother treated us differently, but that didn't improve our relationship. She was always abusive to me, used to provoke me or take and damage all my things and never apologized, but my mother always backed her up and set her as the example of what I should be. I didn't realize how bad it was until I went to therapy in my mid-twenties and the theraphist told me I was being abused, at that time by my ex-narc, after getting out of that situation I continued with my therapy until I discovered that the root of my submissive behavior and normalizing abuse came from my family.

Then I moved to the same city as my sister (it's the capital and I wanted to start from scratch there, because there were many opportunities) and we lived together for a while. In which her abuses continued practically the same as when we were young, which I never thought was possible coming from another adult woman already in her 30s, we fought very badly all the time, I realized that this was another reflection of our family dynamics. When I began to value myself a she criticized me and said that I was arrogant and that I thought I was superior to others, it's not like that, but I was finally able to feel proud of the things I did and how much I advanced since I started my new life. Our relationship got better basically by being apart after she moved out.

Our fight began because I was felling like crap and wanted support/understanding from her (I was having frequent health issues, plus my insomnia, my dog that has her health issues + her newly found incontinence and my economy not being good overwhelmed me) she began to insist that I go to alternative therapies, and while I respect that she likes that and I talk a lot about it with her out of curiosity, I don't believe in that and I'm not in a moment where I‚Äôm whiling to pay something that‚Äôs not a necessity cause there are really important things that I can‚Äôt afford any more like my therapy and other pending medical issues.

I told her that more than that ""help"" I preferred to explain to her about my current situation and that she would try to understand me (I'm not someone who hides those things, but my sister always seems uncomfortable when I mention that I can't do something for not having enough money, then I better suggest doing other things that are nice but free, so basically i live in saving mode), she rolled her eyes annoyed and said ""I already understand enough and I know everything I need to know""

I insisted that she just listen to me. I told her about the situation and that my priorities for now were others, and she offered to pay it for me and I told her I was grateful but that she also had her own problems and I didn't wanted to burden her with my things, she kept insisting and I told her to try to understand that if I had money available I would rather use it in things that I really need, that if she really wanted to help me with something money related it was more than a relief for me if she invites me for a coffee outside the house (I work from home so it really helps), she got angry and said that I never ""let her help me"" and in her eyes I‚Äôm only a victim, I was outraged because, nobody CHOOSES to be a victim  it is something that happens and you cannot control it, besides why would you attack someone who is a victim of something??? (it actually had nothing to do with our talk anyways), it really triggered me cause I busted my ass to get back on my feet and build my life all over after alli went trhu, so I said to her:

OP: And what's wrong with being a victim?

Sis: You're not a victim now

OP: I know that already, and if I was before how is that even relating to this?

Sis: It doesn't matter what you say you're always going to look like a victim to me.

OP: I can't forgive you if you say something like that‚Ä¶

Sis: It doesn't matter, I'm not sorry for what I‚Äôve said and my thinking is not going to change, that's the only thing you are.

OP: I have nothing to be ashamed of if I was a victim, at least I didn't go around abusing others. Shame is for those who abused me. I'm not going to allow you to continue disrespecting me, much less in my own house.

Sis: I have nothing else to say and I don't want to stay here either.

OP: F off and leave then!

My father heard what was happening and intervened and took my side, saying something like it was not the best to mistreat someone who was vulnerable and was having a bad time, we ended up agreeing that we had to learn to manage conflicts better and not continue escalating things.

That day things calmed down, I even sent her a message at night and we talked a little more about it (how to better manage conflicts) and other unimportant things. Then I was convinced that she stopped talking to me when she actually send an unrelated message about a tree and I responded with an emoji (maybe I was too tired to understand anything i really dkn) Since then for months it was radio silence, but I was convinced she was mad at me and I got mad too. Today she sent me a message apologizing saying:

‚ÄúHello sister, I want to apologize to you because I had no right to tell you what I told you, I didn't want to hurt you and I apologize for doing so. I miss you around here and it makes me very sad that the family pattern of siblings fighting is repeated. I would like our bond to be built from another place, it is my wish. I love you. Hug for you and the puppy, I think of you always and the puppy too.‚Äù

By now i've realized that my sister is a person I love for no logical reason, and that every time I remember her I only remember over and over all the ugly things she did, I recognize that she did me an invaluable favor last year (I broke my leg when I traveled for work and couldn't return in 3 months and she was taking care of my dog, but her gesture was overshadowed because from the very day I got hurt she was complaining and telling me that it was not her problem, and that I need to see how to fix it, even now I have no friends or acquaintances I can trust in this new city so I had no way to solve it and I couldn't travel either because if I moved my break could end in a very expensive surgery and I was going to be in debt for years, I offered to pay for everything she needed while she was in my house and of course all the services and things of the house, she said no to everything but from time to time she would call me to mistreat me and pressure me to solve it, at that time she had offered to take care of my dog and that's why I traveled, also before we talked about if something bad happened to me that she would take care of my dog, I was thinking something like death but this other thing happened, I mention it because at some point she claimed that I always say that nobody helps me, but is more like I rather not ask for help because my sister is very busy and when I do she can never do it, even if I go around her schedule and from the beginning she treats me badly as if I‚Äôm a burden if i try to, so when i see hostility from her i just don't ask for help). Just in case I didn't suggest a home care service for my dog cause I didn't know anyone icould trust my dog and my house to, despite the fact that I looked for it, also I didn't want strangers in my house, here I have all my work equipment, Is not top notch at all but I just can‚Äôt buy it again rn, and it would most likely have ended up beign stoled by random ppl (yes, that's how it is where I live) in the end my sister found someone who could take care of my dog and that went well.

I'm starting to believe that the affection I have towards her is just a sequel to the abuse we went through and a lot of loneliness on my part that I covered up by maintaining a relationship with her. I realize that I don't trust her and that she continues to be abusive to me (it's milder but it still hurts). I don't know what to tell her and it makes me very anxious to have that unanswered message. I don't see anything positive for me in that relationship (only superficial things like having someone to go for coffee with and very similar work styles or being related by having survived the same abusers). And really the only thing that matters to me regarding her is that she sees my dog, I don't want my personal situations to take away joys from her life, because she loves her aunt and I don't want my selfishness to ruin the happiness of her last years, but I don't know how to proceed either.

Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular as people seek a brighter, more confident smile. However, one of the most common questions after completing a home teeth whitening treatment is how long to wait before enjoying that beloved morning coffee. Many dental patients worry about potentially undoing their whitening results or causing sensitivity by consuming staining beverages too soon. Understanding the critical post-whitening period is essential for maintaining your newly brightened smile and protecting your investment in dental aesthetics.

Why Timing Matters After Teeth Whitening

Immediately after a teeth whitening treatment, your tooth enamel becomes more porous and susceptible to staining. The whitening process opens up the pores in your teeth, making them more vulnerable to pigmented substances like coffee, tea, and red wine. During this critical window, your teeth are like a blank canvas ready to absorb any color they come into contact with.

Key Factors Affecting Coffee Consumption After Whitening

1. Immediate Post-Whitening Period
Dental experts recommend avoiding coffee for at least 48 hours after your teeth whitening treatment. This crucial period allows your tooth enamel to close its pores and settle into its newly whitened state.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

What Happens If You Drink Coffee Too Soon?

Consuming coffee too quickly after teeth whitening can lead to several undesirable consequences:
- Immediate staining of the fresh white surface
- Potential increased tooth sensitivity
- Reduced effectiveness of the whitening treatment
- Potential blotchy or uneven coloration of teeth

Recommended Waiting Times for Different Whitening Methods

Professional In-Office Whitening
- Minimum waiting time: 48 hours
- Optimal waiting time: 72 hours
- **Complete color stabilization**: Up to one week

At-Home Whitening Kits
- Minimum waiting time: 24-48 hours
- Optimal waiting time: 48-72 hours
- Variation depends on specific product instructions

Tips for Enjoying Coffee After Teeth Whitening

When you're finally ready to reintroduce coffee to your diet, consider these protective strategies:
1. Use a straw to minimize direct contact with teeth
2. Rinse mouth with water immediately after drinking
3. Practice good oral hygiene
4. Consider lighter roast coffees that are less likely to stain

Potential Alternatives During the Waiting Period

If you're struggling to avoid coffee, consider these alternatives:
- Herbal tea
- Water
- Light-colored beverages
- Caffeine supplements

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Long-Term Maintenance of Whitened Teeth

To preserve your bright smile after the initial waiting period:
- Use whitening toothpaste
- Regular dental cleanings
- Limit staining beverages
- Consider touch-up treatments

Scientific Insights

Research indicates that tooth enamel remains more vulnerable to staining for up to two weeks after whitening. A study published in the Journal of Dental Research found that pigmented substances can more easily penetrate freshly whitened teeth during this period.

Personal Experiences and Professional Recommendations

Dental professionals consistently advise patience during the post-whitening period. **The few days of abstaining from coffee are a small price to pay for maintaining a brilliant, long-lasting white smile.**

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Understanding Individual Variations

Each person's teeth respond differently to whitening treatments. Factors like:
- Initial tooth color
- Whitening method used
- Personal oral hygiene
- Enamel sensitivity

Can all impact the recommended waiting time and coffee consumption guidelines.

Conclusion

Protecting your newly whitened smile requires mindful behavior during the critical post-treatment period. While the temptation to drink coffee might be strong, waiting 48-72 hours ensures the best possible results from your teeth whitening treatment. By following professional guidelines and practicing good oral care, you can enjoy a bright, confident smile that lasts longer and looks more impressive. Your patience and careful approach will pay off with stunning, long-lasting white teeth that make you feel more confident in every smile",1,1739072717.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 105 lbs, on a plant based, gf, no sugar added diet for over five years now. No caffeine for 15 years, no history of coffee, tea, no carbonated beverages, no drinking or smoking of any kind or pain relievers. I exercise daily with yoga and tai chi, track my step count to make sure I‚Äôm not sedentary, I do deep breathing three times per day and meditate daily. 


At the beginning of last month, I ate a large chickpea pasta and broccoli meal with garlic powder before bed (I hadn‚Äôt been eating garlic cloves or onion for a year but the powder seemed okay). I overdid the garlic powder on the meal, took magnesium and went to sleep. Big mistake. The burning in my esophagus felt like someone had lodged a flame thrower from my stomach to my throat. I went to the ER and started on 20 mg of PPI. Can‚Äôt have H-2 blockers because of a sensitivity. 


I immediately went on the acid free diet and have been very disciplined with it, stopped the magnesium, don‚Äôt eat five hours before bed and sleep sitting straight up (adjustable bed and wedge pillow) but the burning keeps happening. I called my Dr and they said take 40 mg of PPI. I get a day or two of relief then the burning comes back. What can I do in the meantime that I‚Äôm not already doing? Will it just take time?


Forgot to add, I‚Äôve been housebound (anxiety) for over two years so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been exposed to HP but I guess it‚Äôs still a possibility. Funny thing is the trip to the ER helped with that and I‚Äôm able to go out again. Another thing I‚Äôve noticed, the burning stops when my stomach is full. It only starts up when I‚Äôm falling asleep sitting up. So, not eating five hours before bed is making it hurt more. Maybe taking the PPI and then having a snack an hour later right before bed would help? Instead of starving myself all night and taking it when I get up. Any ideas? ",1,1739072648.0,GERD,4,1.0,False

**Background**: My partner and I are moving to Chicago (for work). With that being said, we're pretty stoked about it because we both fell in love with it when we visited a few years ago. We have lived primarily in the NE, specifically NYC (both Manhattan and the Bronx). 

**Why the South Loop:** We've looked at a few areas, and we both seem pretty happy with Printer's Row/South Loop. We've read several threads, and we understand it can be a *sleepy* area, and that's fine with us. We have no issue traveling to other areas if we want to go out. We're pretty set with a few solid coffee shops and small businesses. Another reason we're set on it is the proximity to the park and the lake. Being close to green spaces is important to us, and we wanted to be within a quick walking distance.

Cool. Hopefully that answers anyone who might be asking *why* we're looking at this area. **We've found a couple of buildings that have interested us (Sentral, The Cooper, 1000 South Clark), so if you have any personal experiences, please share.**

Otherwise, my main question is this: **I've read that a lot of people love the South Loop, but it seems like even when people have nothing but good things to say... they all still mention Roosevelt station.** Now, we've ridden the NYC subway day and night, we've lived in some sketchy neighborhoods when we were broke college kids, and all of that was... fine. *Sus*, but, ultimately, fine. So, is everyone being dramatic? Have y'all never lived in another major city? Should we be looking elsewhere? Is it just the station‚Äìi.e. is it self-contained?‚Äìor is it the entire area? I don't even think we'll be taking the train often since we like walking when possible, but clue me in *please (am I going to get murdered? jk)*

I don't want to live somewhere where I'm constantly being harassed or where I'm scared to have my girlfriends/family visit. They're all already up in the air about Chicago being dangerous, and I hate being told ""I told you so."" My partner and I agree that any major city can be dangerous (uh, cue NYC), but are we walking ourselves into some kind of miserable (ahem, dangerous) trap? I seriously cannot get a clear read from everything I've read. 

PS. Yes, we're going to visit in person, but visiting is very different than living. So, if you have lived experience, that's what we're hoping to read/understand.

Basically, for context, a couple years ago I saw this episode on the television, from one of those paranormal stories shows. Like, one of the ones where they sit the family down and do an interview with them, they do the reenactments as the family tells their story, that kind of stuff. But there‚Äôs specifically this one episode I remember seeing that I can‚Äôt seem to find anywhere, I can‚Äôt recall the name of the episode or of the series it was apart of. 

All I remember is some of the story with the reenactments/visuals. I think it was about story about some sort of demon/entity or something like that that lived in the basement of this home and used to torment one of the sons of the family, in particular. I don‚Äôt remember a lot, but I specifically remember a scene where the son (I think) grew up and the family had since either moved out of the house or were staying somewhere else, so he went back to the home to conduct his own investigation of some sort. In doing so, it was morning and he felt like he couldn‚Äôt breathe, like he was sitting at the table with a coffee mug and all of sudden couldn‚Äôt breathe. So he ran out of the house and just never went back in. It was then followed up that the house was still abandoned and nobody went back into the house since that day (at least up to the date of the episode). 

This is probably super messy and scatter, but it‚Äôs been bothering me for a while now. Some of it may be misremembering because I watched so many of these as a kid. I think of it every couple months and I just can‚Äôt remember what the episode name was, it‚Äôs just eating away at me to find it.

I moved here to Seattle 4 months ago for various reasons, some personal, but to put it simply, I needed a change in my life. I‚Äôm a 21-year-old man, and I feel like I don‚Äôt click with most of the people I‚Äôve met since being here. To be completely honest, I just want to find some friends who are like me; ambitious, open-minded, independent thinkers who are just trying to make the best of our lives.

I‚Äôve done pretty much every social event imaginable to get out there and meet people. I‚Äôve been using Meetup now to minuscule success. Every group that claims to include people in their early 20s never in fact have anyone there under the age of 30 99% of the time. The standard is pretty much the same on similar sites like Eventbrite. At best, I get a wide spectrum of people, but mostly they‚Äôre older millennials who are already comfortable in some career and just don‚Äôt share the same mindset as me of wanting to try a bunch of new things, seeking adventure, art, learning, exploration, and overall newness.¬†

I am also much aware at this point that the young people here tend to hang out at bars and clubs and things of that nature, but that‚Äôs never been my style and I don‚Äôt hit it off with the type of people who frequent those places. There are also exponentially more things to do in the world for social stimulation than getting a beer and engaging in soul-killing small talk for 2 hours. I just want to meet some mature, open-minded people, but I also want to find some people who are around my age, preferably in their early 20s because I need some youthful ambition in my life right now.¬†

One specific moment that I recall is that Yuki tries to drink coffee in front of the main character because she wanted to seem mature after her older sister said something. There was another group of chapters where the characters were on a school camping trip, and the main character decides to secretly start a live stream as a bunny vtuber, but was caught by Yuki, who turned out to be a fan of his. Another scene in the camping part is that the main character wanted to watch the stars with Yuki, but then was interfered by his childhood friend who wanted to catch beetles, which in the end, everyone decided to do both activities together.

1il5ltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1il5ltd/family_drama_and_grief/,Family drama and grief,"Throwaway account because some of my family members know my main account.

Mom died two weeks ago after an extended decline from dementia and other health issues. Mom‚Äôs biggest wish before she was sick was that my siblings and I stay connected. She and Dad were not close to their families and I think she wanted us to break that cycle.

After death siblings usually fight over money, right? Not us. Nope. We fight about the damn celebration of life, which should be an easy thing to plan but has somehow created a massive rift in the family. 

My brother is at the center of the conflict. He‚Äôs 54 and has never been close with any of us. Our parents were not perfect, mistakes were made, and we all had childhood trauma. I went to therapy, I have no idea if the other two did. My sister has never seemed to hold anything against our mom, I worked through mine and let things go. Brother can‚Äôt. Ok, fine. 

He stayed away from mom and dad for the last few decades. He has a child (20 yrs) from a previous relationship and he feels like my parents didn‚Äôt accept her or really make an effort to know her. My parents, for their part, felt unwanted and unwelcome, so yes, they didn‚Äôt do as much as they should/could have. 

He got married two years ago to a woman with two kids (they‚Äôre now 21 and 17). We all went to their wedding, embraced them into the family, etc. 

He has had little to no involvement in Mom‚Äôs care over the past 7 months when everything quickly and horribly went downhill. He opted to stay away, saying he wanted to have good memories. Ok, we accepted and respected that. We kept him updated on her condition constantly.

Now she‚Äôs gone and my sister and I are trying to plan the celebration of life. Dad wants all the grandkids there, so we‚Äôre trying to coordinate with college schedules, high school graduations, and summer plans. We find a date we think works and brother says no, it‚Äôs his stepkid‚Äôs birthday. We offer up other dates (that include my family canceling a trip we had planned but we would cancel because to us, this is more important). He has a reason none of those work.

He finally says he‚Äôs not interested in attending a celebration of life and that his wife is insecure and worried we won‚Äôt accept her or one of her kids who is transgender. My dad is very conservative and has spoken badly about the LGBTQIA community. However, dad is also conflict averse and would rather die than do anything that might create conflict. He is also not a mean person, and if he knows that this family member is transgender, he will respect that and not be a bigot about it. But my brother and his wife have kept it from him while vilifying him and imagining this scenario in their heads that probably involves Dad throwing holy water or something at the teen and screaming that he‚Äôs going to hell. Folks, I promise you he will not do that. The man is going to be focused on his dead wife and that‚Äôs it. 

I also need to point out that I, too, have a transgender teen. We haven‚Äôt told my parents because with mom‚Äôs dementia, it would be hard for her to grasp. We wanted to wait until she passed to tell Dad, so now I will. I have no qualms about this and believe he will accept it (he may not like it and will certainly pray privately about it, but he will say nothing to me OR my child). 

I tried to find compromises with my brother and his wife. I personally don‚Äôt think a birthday is a good reason to not have a celebration of life but that‚Äôs me. I know some people love birthdays and I guess the teen does. His wife said she does not want her son‚Äôs birthday associated with death. Ok. 

My last plea was could my brother please attend the celebration of life in the morning and be back to his wife and kids in plenty of time for the birthday dinner. I said I think it would look weird if all of us siblings weren‚Äôt there and he said no, it would look weird if his family wasn‚Äôt there and that would reflect poorly on him.

He then said he feels like we don‚Äôt respect or accept his family and that they aren‚Äôt important enough to schedule around. And I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ done. 

What really frustrates me is that his wife has lost TWO husbands and her own mother. She understands death and grief, yet her insecurities have now become the focal point of everything. My brother wants her to feel comfortable and we have never done anything to hurt her. If anything I feel like we have bent over backwards to welcome her and her children; we are genuinely so happy that she makes our brother happy. He deserves that. And now I‚Äôm having all sorts of not so nice feelings and thoughts about her and my brother. 

My dad will not have a celebration of life if my brother isn‚Äôt there. I will talk to my dad and explain that his son doesn‚Äôt want to attend and my brother will lie and say it‚Äôs about the birthday when it‚Äôs really about his wife and teen and their assumption of how my dad will act. 

I am so angry at my brother and hurt that he‚Äôs doing this. And this makes me upset because we are letting mom down and fighting, which she would not want. I feel like absolute garbage now. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I know all of our feelings are big and blown up because we‚Äôre all grieving. I‚Äôm trying to not respond to anything when I am worked up. I want to stay levelheaded. But this is so painful. 

Sorry this is long. It‚Äôs late where I am and while I‚Äôm meeting my best friend for coffee in the morning, I needed to get this out. ",2,1739071814.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

# Step 1: Ads That Print Clicks (and $$$)

Your ad isn‚Äôt just about catching attention, it‚Äôs about prequalifying buyers before they even land on your page. That means making ads that filter out time-wasters while preparing buyers to say, ‚ÄúShut up and take my money.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what works:

**Call Out a Specific Problem**: Vague ads don‚Äôt convert. You need to hit them with precision.Example: Instead of ‚ÄúStruggling with Facebook Ads?‚Äù say:*‚ÄúYour FB ads are spending $100/day and bringing back $0. Sound familiar? Fix it today for $9.‚Äù*See the difference? One is relatable *and* actionable.

**Position the Offer as a Steal, Not Cheap**: You‚Äôre pricing low ticket, but you don‚Äôt want it to feel like a throwaway product.Example: Instead of saying, ‚ÄúOnly $9,‚Äù frame it like:*‚ÄúGet the blueprint we used to 3x our ROAS for less than the price of your morning coffee.‚Äù*

**Be VERY Clear in Your CTA**: You‚Äôre not writing poetry, make the next step obvious.Example: ‚ÄúClick below to grab the guide instantly.‚Äù

Tip: Creatives matter. For low ticket offers, *ugly creatives work*. Use raw, native content, selfies, etc. Make it feel personal.

# Step 2: A Funnel That Milks Every Dollar

Once they click, the funnel takes over. And the funnel‚Äôs job? To make it nearly impossible to say no while increasing the value of every sale.

Here‚Äôs what your funnel should look like:

1. **Landing Page**:

* **Headline**: Your headline needs to *scream* the value of the offer.Example: *‚ÄúStop Losing Money on Ads. Fix It Today for Just $9.‚Äù*

* **Why They Need It Now**: FOMO is your friend. Add urgency, like:*‚ÄúGet instant access before this offer expires.‚Äù*

* **Social Proof**: Even if it‚Äôs just 5 testimonials or screenshots of DMs, it‚Äôs gold.
* **Fast Checkout**: One field, one button. Don‚Äôt make them think.  

1. **The Upsell Game**:

* The first upsell is where the real money is made. Your goal is to bump the AOV (average order value) without scaring them off. Keep the price low, but high enough to justify the value.Example: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the guide, now let me save you even more time. Get my ad templates for just $27.‚Äù*
* Upsell logic: 10x the perceived value for the price. They‚Äôll spend $9 on your guide, but $27 for templates that ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù faster results is a no-brainer.

**3. Second Upsell: Premium Tier Offer**If they say yes to the first upsell, they‚Äôre already warmed up, this is your chance to pitch something high ticket, but still affordable. Think $47-$97.

Example: *‚ÄúWant me to personally walk you through scaling your ads? Join my 7-day workshop for just $67.‚Äù*

If they say no to the first upsell? Hit them with a downsell. Maybe a $17 checklist or swipe file. Remember, every extra dollar adds up.

1. **Thank You Page With Intent**Don‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄúThanks for your order.‚Äù Use this page to:

* Get them to join your email list or community.
* Offer a time-sensitive bonus: *‚ÄúShare this with a friend in the next 24 hours, and both of you get my exclusive case study for free.‚Äù*
* Preview your high ticket offers: *‚ÄúNext step: Learn how we scale to $10k months, check your inbox for details.‚Äù*

# Step 3: Building Lifetime Value (Where Most People Fail)

The $9 sale isn‚Äôt the goal, it‚Äôs the bait. The real money comes from upsells, repeat purchases, and nurturing them into high ticket buyers.

Here‚Äôs the play:

* **Automated Email Sequences**:Once someone buys, they‚Äôre more likely to buy again within the first 7 days. Use this window to pitch:
   1. A recap of their purchase (*‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how to get the most out of your $9 guide‚Äù*).
   2. A quick win: *‚ÄúHere‚Äôs one strategy from the guide that doubled my ROAS in 24 hours.‚Äù*
   3. Your next offer: *‚ÄúReady to scale? Join my private coaching group for $97/month.‚Äù*
* **Community = OP**:Build a space where buyers can interact. A private Facebook group, Telegram channel, or Discord makes them feel part of something bigger.
* **Subscription Upsells**:Add a membership option for recurring revenue. Example: *‚ÄúFor $29/month, get exclusive weekly ad breakdowns and real-time support.‚Äù*

# Step 4: Scaling Ads Without Wasting Budget

Once you‚Äôve validated your offer, it‚Äôs time to scale.

* **Start Small, Scale Slowly**: Test with $20/day per ad set, focusing on one audience. Once you see consistent ROAS, double the budget every 3-4 days.

* Use retargeting to hit warm leads who didn‚Äôt convert the first time.

* **Refresh Creatives Weekly**:Low ticket offers die quickly. Create copies of your top-performing ads to keep engagement high.Example: If a raw selfie video works, record 3-4 more with slight tweaks in your script and hook.

# Step 5: Constant Testing and Optimization

Winning funnels aren‚Äôt static. They evolve.

* **Test Your Offers**:If your $9 guide isn‚Äôt converting at 1% or higher, tweak the positioning. Maybe the price is too low for perceived value, try bumping it to $19.
* **Optimize Upsells**:If the first upsell isn‚Äôt converting, test a different product or price point. Sometimes reducing the upsell price by $10 can double your conversion rate.

**Analyze Your Data**:Look at drop-off points in your funnel. Are people clicking the ad but bouncing from the landing page? Test your headline. Are they abandoning checkout? Simplify the form.**How to Build a Profitable Low-Ticket Funnel**

I love getting to know people, and shopping, and rock climbing, and the gym. Well, the gym and I have a love hate relationship, but I still would like to go once in a while.
I love going to random coffee shops and exploring new places.
But the older I get, the less I care for dealing with the public. By the end of my day, I'm just so tired from actively trying to do all the things I enjoy, and by nature being forced to interact with the public and their stupid reactions to the blind thing that I'd literally find it more relaxing to just stay home and do absolutely nothing.
I understand this isn't a realistic approach, and I also like feeling like a badass so these people aren't going to stop me from doing my thing. But, god damn, it's annoying.

Today, for example, I got an uber. Our entire interaction sucked. He kept calling me honey, telling me I could take my time in this condescending tone (like take my time doing what.... getting into the car)?! Kept telling me that my dog was a gift from god (I agree he's pretty great, but he's not my care taker which is what the dude was insinuating).

Then I get to my nail place. It's supposed to be a relaxing time to get my nails done and space out until it's time to leave, right? Wrong. The nail lady thought it was wise to start a conversation with me by asking who cooks for me at home. Girl, you think I have money like that? You think my ass would be here getting my nails done if I had money like that? I'd just hire a nail rep to come to my house. lol
But in all seriousness, I'm 28 and live with my roommate. We barely see each other on a less busy day. She's not my maid, she just helps me pay the bills. But I guess the first thing most people jump to is that I live with mommy and daddy who cook for me and also wipe my butt.
I bet she would never ask anyone else that.
Then I go to leave and she tells me to be careful. Of what??? Getting out of my chair? Wow, that's so dangerous.

Anyway, this all in one day when it was supposed to be a relaxing day is entirely too much and I'm over it. The mental exhaustion is unreal. Anyone else?",1,1739071681.0,Blind,0,1.0,False

We don't have to do anything extravagant or significant, kahit tamang chill lang but make it a little special oks na.

This can sound obnoxious, but take it how you want it: My friends (of < 1 year and of 10+ years) say I'm a good catch, some even say rare catch. Gusto ko lang to ilagay dito to set a standard, but also to give space for me to try and show up *confidently* to a good quality man like you.

**I don't know how to sell myself, so I'll just list things that best describe me:**

* Detail-oriented & analytical, but I'm chill. There are just certain things/topics that get my gears grinding, that I enjoy doing.
* Messy organized-type
* Genuine & prefers genuine connection even with online randos
* Good at effective communication / listening / understanding
* Highly appreciate call outs if worded properly
* Passionate about personal growth & self-work / shadow work. I also have therapy once a month, every month to make sure I'm healing properly.
* Highly self-aware & empathic
* Emotionally intelligent & emotionally mature, but sometimes still immature (i.e., stubbornness, voluntary age regression)
* I have found my life's purpose and am interested in empowering others in their own journeys. This also helps me navigate my own journey. I like learning about new perspectives, not necessarily new things.
* I like engaging in thought-provoking convos. I have 3 card games like this, mga life questions type. 
* More comfortable speaking in Taglish. I also type with full words, correct spellings, and check my grammar regularly. Idk, I enjoy doing this.
* Picky eater, grew up with (and still get) princess treatment, but I'm a trauma survivor. You don't have to worry about me being mean and all cos I know what that feels like.
* Agnostic & apolitical. I‚Äôm ok talking about faith & spirituality, but not politics. 

**Hobbies**:

* Tarot reading (always)
* YouTube/Netflix (most times)
* Gaming (most times), would love to play controller-friendly co-op games with you on PC!
* Reading a book (rare)
* Gouache painting (rare)

**What I'm looking for?**

* Someone who's on about the same maturity level as I am. If you think this is too much, kindly pass me by.
* Aged between 24-29. I prefer younger men or those about my same age, but definitely not older than me. I prefer to have someone I can grow up & grow old with.
* Preferably for long term relationship leading to marriage, but you can chat even if it's just for Valentines' date.
* Someone with class but doesn‚Äôt have to wear/have fancy stuff. But preferably has car (for ease of transportation).
* Can hatid/sundo. I'm a new driver and a homebody + don't have own car, so while I do have the license, I don't have the car or the experience to do the same üòÖ
* Be taller than me, but not too tall. Maybe between 5'7 to 5'11.

* Someone who does not have an issue with making time for me
* NOT a people pleaser
* Someone who has a slim, almost dad bod body type, but hopefully not a dad bod without any fitness activity
* Someone who is knowledgeable about tech like PC building, game troubleshooting, hardware / software problems, etc.

* Text > Calls. But sometimes I like both.
* Can handle multiple topics in the same conversation, but can also hold different conversations across several platforms üòÇ

I have taken the drive once (to move out to SD 3 years ago) but didn‚Äôt stop much besides to sleep in hotels & some coffee shops. I took the middle route. 

But this time, I‚Äôm looking to move again (parents are just based in NY) and 1) I‚Äôd love to make more of a ‚Äútrip‚Äù out of it and see some things on the way back 2) I‚Äôm looking to move again and idk where sooo I‚Äôm not sure if I should take this time to explore off the path a bit before heading home 

Some places I have friends/would think about moving are:
Scottsdale AZ, Austin TX, would love to see Oklahoma, Denver, St Pete FL, St Augustine FL, Charolette NC and Wilmington NC 

I don‚Äôt want the trip to be longer than 1.5-2 weeks for money purposes 

I know I can‚Äôt possibly hit everything I want to hit hence why I‚Äôm here! 

Wondering if I should indeed drive to Florida first since that‚Äôs an area I‚Äôd consider moving, and hit Austin on the way (have a friend there/could save on a hotel) then could drive up the EC and hit a few spots ‚Äî but this could be costly and time consuming 

Or if it‚Äôs worth it to take an entire route entirely, and just straight home to NY, hit a few things already on that route or slightly off the path and consider flying to other areas/taking a separate trip

I recently got back into collecting, and also last year bought a 3D printer. 

We had an old K-Cup holder that was taking up valuable space on the counter so we got one that pulls out under the coffee maker itself.

Well, I looked at that and saw a way to display my 1oz coins.

Turns out the top row and the bottom row are slightly shorter, so I will probably make smaller ones for my fractional gold I plan to buy more of, since the diameter of the 1oz coin, (I used 42.9 mm in my recess and a depth of 8mm), doesn't pass through those openings. 

As long as you align the recess hole to the bottom of the holder you get a little slot to lift the coin back out, and it works great.  If you wanted to show the other side of the coin even.. 

Then I thought...

Maybe I will make it see-thru then you can push it out easier or just leave it in and show it that way. Smaller hole to the bottom and a little ridge stops it from going all the way thru.

1il5f1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/1il5f1h/an_opinion_on_ferry_travels/,An opinion on ferry travels,"I live in Bremerton and hate the Bremerton ferry schedule and length. I travel all over the area, up to two hours away. The quick passenger only ferry is great to be fair, but if you‚Äôre driving there‚Äôs better options. 

My favorite by far is the Kingston-Edmonds ferry. It‚Äôs fast and there‚Äôs no better ferry for anything north of Seattle. Also the Cup N‚ÄôMuffin right before the ferry has great food and coffee. It‚Äôs not just a shack that only has shitty breakfast and okay coffee

On the flip side, Edmonds-Kingston is rough. It‚Äôs an easy ferry to miss as it fills up so fast. There are good food options there as well though. 

Bainbridge ferry is typically terrible. The driver commute time is inconsistent and long in typical commute hours. There‚Äôs no quick food options other than McDonald‚Äôs on the way and it puts right in downtown Seattle like the Bremerton ferry. 

I‚Äôve come to really like the Southworth ferry. The stop at Vashon makes it a bit longer than I‚Äôd like, but it can be worth it based on timing. I usually use it to get home rather to get to the other side. Not great for quick food, other than McDonald‚Äôs again, unless you want to order ahead at Alan‚Äôs Country Cafe. 

Lastly, driving towards Olympia in general. The drive through Shelton take about 15ish min longer, but is such a nice drive it‚Äôs worth it. Much less traffic and much less variable because of that. It‚Äôs also just beautiful.

I (22F) met bf (23M) at Fallfest the third day at my new school and in a new city. We hit it off immediately, and were dating within a week. So essentially, I moved somewhere completely new with no friends, and immediately started dating BF. He was lovely and interesting and things were great, but began to break down. I said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù almost immediately bc when you know you know, and he said it back but later retracted it and said things were going too fast. 

I agreed that things were going too fast but we couldn‚Äôt seem to slow things down. We liked each other a lot, and were essentially each other‚Äòs only close friend in this new city. We both struggle with mental health and became big emotional supports to each other during mental health crisis.

 I invited him home for Christmas and he agreed, but later said no because we had begun to have big fights over the intensity of the relationship and other issues. It felt like every small thing became a big thing. But my mom insisted he come for Christmas because it was one week before the holiday and she already made plans. So he came to Christmas and then I made a huge mistake because there was a gap in my fall and spring housing and I had assumed I would stay with BF for that time. In the fall things had been going really well to the point that he had casually suggested me living in his apartment for the spring semester. This meant I was left without an alternate housing plan and ended up staying with him for the ten day gap, obviously the issues blew up and we broke up.

At this point, we had been dating for four months, but essentially living together on and off for two months (I know: bad choices). Originally during the break up we said it was just to reevaluate and we would discuss getting back together in a few weeks. But we stayed very close friends, seeing eachother every day for two weeks and sleeping together a few times without fully having sex. I was thrown into a depressive episode, probably as a result of the break up. I didn‚Äôt have any other close friends in the area so BF was this big emotional support even though we weren‚Äôt supposed to be dating. I think in that period he just lost all attraction for me. 

He told me a few times that it looked like the breakup was going to be permanent. I told him that, even though I thought that we could still be friends when we initially broke up, I don‚Äôt actually think I can ever be friends with him because I have romantic feelings. I wanted you no contact. He was really sad and said that he needed to ‚Äúmourn the loss of a dear friend.‚Äù I felt bad and I still desperately wanted to date him so I came back a day later and said that we should try being friends with strong boundaries because I don‚Äôt wanna throw away something that could be forever just because we met a few years too early. Which is true, I think that we‚Äôre extremely compatible and met at a bad time. 

However, being friends has been hell for me. I‚Äôve been in one of the most intense suicidal episodes of my life. I feel like I can‚Äôt stop going to him for emotional support even though I can feel his lack of attraction and it makes me disgusted with myself after we hang out. I feel like I am being broken up with over and over and over again. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to be an emotional burden and he reiterated a bunch of times that he‚Äôs supporting me because he genuinely likes me as a friend and wants me in his life, but he also told me the longer I use him for emotional support, the further  we get from every dating again.

I decided that I was going to stop talking to anyone for a few days to try to pull myself out of this depressive episode, but 24 hours into my hermit phase I broke and walked over to his house to ask for some potatoes because I want to make french fries. I knew he had some. He was really upset that I had come over without texting first even though earlier that day he said he was really sad that he wouldn‚Äôt see me. He told me that he might have a new girl over and how is he going to explain his ex randomly coming over. I started crying and gave him back his potatoes and was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I act like this around you, I‚Äôm really sorry, I‚Äôll never do it again.‚Äù and he told me he felt like I never gave him the space to have a crush on me or like me, which hurt me more. It just feels really weird and harmful having a friend that I can go to for emotional support, but the cost is that I‚Äôm losing the relationship I want with him. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. 

Here‚Äôs where I may be a bad person. I told him repeatedly while we were dating and while we were breaking up that he was my best friend and I would always want to be friends with him. He was really upset when I wanted to go no contact and I feel bad about flip-flopping on him multiple times because I‚Äôve kind of been flip-flopping on boundaries the entire relationship. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me that I can‚Äôt seem to just be friends with him or just date him casually. But also, I would never stop loving him or stop having a crush on him because he acted in a way that was cringe. Like I feel like he‚Äôs still in the ick stage of the relationship and I‚Äôm just way past that. I will always feel more strongly towards him then he does towards me. What do I do? Should I ask him to go no contact again? Would I be a bad person?

(p.s. We did try to make friends and made that a priority, especially during the end of our relationship. I am in a one year program and I am planning to leave this city because of how difficult it is to make friends here. Most people who live here grew up here and just don‚Äôt seem interested in making new connections. I am in clubs and have a plethora of people that I get coffee with, but can‚Äôt seem to become close with anyone. I have never been this lonely in my life and have also never found it this hard to make friends. I am 99% extroverted and don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard here.)

(TL:DR, I am trying to address my mental health problems as best I can. I have already tried any possible solutions/insurance work around you have for me, I promise.

Also the mental health stuff is complicated but I just started a medication for PMDD, since it‚Äôs a mood stabilizing medication, it will take three months to kick in and may not even help. In the meantime, I don‚Äôt have access to therapy. I just can‚Äôt afford the co-pay. I also don‚Äôt have the correct diagnosis and everyone knows it. I would need neuro-psychiatric testing to be diagnosed with ADHD or autism, which is likely causing the issues. But that testing is not covered by insurance so I have a preliminary diagnosis for clinical depression and anxiety and have gone to therapy but now I can‚Äôt afford that co-pay.)",1,1739070727.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,1,1.0,False

Greetings fellow tokers both medical and recreational! I hope everyone is having a great day. Today we're diving deep into an intensive strain analysis of Stay Puft and its genetics, made possible through our collaboration with the Crysp team. *Shout out to the Team for making this analysis happen.* This isn't your typical review - we're going to break down every aspect of this strain through a scientific lens, examining both the original genetics and Crysp's interpretation of this fascinating cultivar. If you were looking for just a quick review, I've added a TLDR at the very end, just for you.

> ‚öñÔ∏è **Farm Bill Compliance Disclaimer:**  
> This review examines hemp-derived products containing less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC by dry weight, in full compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill. All products discussed are legal under federal law. Consumers should consult their local regulations regarding hemp products.

## About Crysp

In the rapidly evolving hemp market, Crysp has established themselves as a cultivation-focused company specializing in premium hemp flower. Their business model centers on adapting established cannabis genetics for the hemp market, with particular attention to maintaining complex terpene profiles and physical characteristics of the original strains.

üè¢ **Company Focus:**
* Indoor cultivation of premium hemp flower
* Preservation of traditional cannabis genetics
* Three-tier quality classification system
* Direct-to-consumer sales model

Crysp utilizes a tiered system for their products, with Stay Puft designated as a Tier 1 offering ($100/quarter, shipping included). This classification reflects their assessment of the strain's genetic complexity, cultivation requirements, and overall quality metrics.

What distinguishes their approach is their emphasis on genetic preservation in hemp cultivation. Rather than developing new hemp-specific strains, they focus on adapting established cannabis genetics while maintaining compliance with federal guidelines. With this particular strain, the genetics were spot on.

### Crysp's Interpretation

What makes this version particularly fascinating is Crysp's successful adaptation of these elite genetics for the hemp market. They've managed to preserve the complex terpene profiles and distinctive characteristics while maintaining full Farm Bill compliance. The strain has already influenced the broader cannabis market, demonstrating that premium hemp flower can maintain the sophisticated characteristics of its ancestors while being accessible to a broader audience.

### The $100 Question: Is Crysp's Stay Puft Worth Tier 1 Status?

Before we dive into these elite genetics, let's address the premium price point. At $100 per quarter (shipping included), this Tier 1 offering positions itself at the top of the hemp market. The question isn't just about quality - it's about whether Crysp has successfully translated a potent 25% THC strain into a premium hemp experience.

### Genetic Background & Parent Analysis

Stay Puft represents modern cannabis breeding at its finest, combining two powerhouse strains that each bring distinct and complementary characteristics to create something extraordinary.

> **Parent 1: Marshmallow OG**
>
> Here's a fun bit of cannabis culture - the name perfectly describes its distinctive vanilla/marshmallow terpene profile. This phenotype emerged as a standout for its unique sweet expression and consistently high cannabinoid production.
> A highly sought-after cultivar contributing:
> * Signature vanilla-forward terpene profile
> * Dense, tight bud formation
> * Heavy resin production
> * Thick flower clusters
> * Traditional potency: 22-25% THC
> * Distinctive creamy sweetness

> üçá **Parent 2: Grape Gasoline**
>
> Part of the modern wave of gas-forward strains, this parent brought sophisticated grape-fuel profiles and enhanced resin production to the cross. The combination created something special that would give Stay Puft its distinctive berry-fuel characteristics.
> A modern heavyweight adding:
> * Complex grape-berry notes
> * Heavy gas/diesel backend
> * Purple-tinged expression
> * Exceptional trichome coverage
> * Traditional potency: 23-27% THC
> * Strong lateral branching

### Hybrid Expression & Characteristics

Where these genetics meet, Stay Puft demonstrates the best of both parents:

* Trichome Profile: Marshmallow OG's heavy resin meets Grape Gasoline's crystal production
* Aroma: Sweet vanilla forward profile with complex grape-gas backend
* Structure: Dense framework with improved calyx development
* Color: Rich green base with purple potential
* Traditional Potency: Consistently testing around 25% THC

## Aroma Analysis

I had hyped this up so much that when it arrived, I was afraid I was setting myself up for the inevitable letdown. As soon as I opened the mylar, that sentiment changed quick. I was hit with a POWERFUL sweet/vanilla forward profile with strong hints of berry with a diesel backend that meets the vanilla to come full circle. The genetics of the parents could not be more obvious. Diesel grape notes X marshmallow notes. This is a level of aroma you just don't usually get without spending the extra money.

I can confidently say from experience it rivals any strain I've had in the medical market in potency of smell and goes beyond it with its complexity. This puts a capstone in an argument I had earlier with someone on Reddit; There is absolutely no reason anybody should be questioning the genetics of what they order. If you are ordering from a company and you're not positive when you taste it, smell it, smoke it, if it's the legitimate strain it's either low quality or incorrectly expressed genetics. There is no guess work anymore, while terpene profiles can vary from iteration to iteration, ratios do not and quality genetics and bud is immediately recognizable by anyone who knows what to look for.

üëÉ **Initial Aroma Test (First Opening)**
* Dominant: Strong vanilla/marshmallow sweetness
* Secondary: Fresh grape-berry notes
* Backend: Complex fuel/diesel
* Overall Strength: Exceptional (fills room immediately)

### Deeper Olfactory Analysis

**Primary Notes:**
* Sweet vanilla cream
* Fresh berries
* Grape candy
* Diesel fuel
* Marshmallow

**Secondary Notes:**
* Light cookie dough
* Gas
* Sweet cream
* Subtle earth

**Tertiary Notes:**
* Faint spice
* Subtle floral undertones
* Mineral notes

### Terpene Expression
* Strength: Strong
* Preservation: Excellent
* Complexity: High
* Lasting Power: Extended (aroma lingers)

### Breaking Down The Bud
* Initial Break: Sharp increase in grape gas notes
* Ground Material: Sweet vanilla becomes more pronounced
* Post-Grind: Perfect balance of sweet and fuel notes

### Parent Strain Expression
* Marshmallow OG Influence: 60% (dominant sweet notes)
* Grape Gasoline Influence: 40% (complex grape-gas backend)

### Unique Characteristics
* Circular aroma profile (sweet ‚Üí berry ‚Üí gas ‚Üí sweet)
* Exceptional room presence
* Clean transitions between notes
* No hay or hemp notes detected

## Physical Analysis

When you first open the mylar bag containing Crysp's Stay Puft, you're immediately struck by the quality of what you're looking at. Seven grams of absolutely beautiful, chunky nugs present themselves, showcasing the best of both parent strains' physical characteristics.

### Structure & Cure
* Bud Structure: Chunky, dense formations
* Density: Perfect compression without being rock-hard
* Trim: Clean, professional hand-trim
* Formation: Tight, well-developed calyxes
* Trichome Preservation: Exceptional, intact heads

The cure on these buds is nothing short of perfect. They have that ideal squishy, sticky quality with excellent bounce-back when squeezed - telltale signs of proper curing and hydration. ""Fresh"" doesn't quite capture it; these buds feel like they were packaged yesterday.

### Visual Breakdown
The coloration is immediately striking - bright, vibrant greens intermingled with lighter sage variations, and occasional purple tones creating a dynamic palette that catches the light. Bright orange pistils weave throughout the structure, but what really demands attention is the trichome coverage. This isn't just a light dusting. The level of resin production is exactly what you'd expect from a Tier 1 offering.

### Market Comparison
Having extensive experience with Pennsylvania's medical program, I can confidently say this exceeds the appearance of about 95% of what's available there. The similarity to Strane or Holistic Industries' top-shelf offerings is striking - this is premium grade material by any market's standards.

## Effects Analysis & Patient Experience

*MEDICAL DISCLAIMER: While I possess extensive cannabis knowledge and real-world experience as a patient, I am not a medical professional. This analysis serves as an experiential reference point based on my personal medical conditions and responses. Always consult healthcare providers about your specific situation.*

### Patient Background & Context

As someone managing multiple conditions through cannabis therapy, my experience spans recreational, legacy and medical type 1, 2, and 3 flower markets.

üë§ **Patient Profile**

**Demographics:**
* Age: 39
* Gender: Male
* Weight: 190lbs
* Cannabis Experience: 25 years
* Tolerance Level: Medium
* Consumption Method: Flower smoker
* Recovery Status: 29 months

**Medical Conditions:**
* Primary:
  * Insomnia
  * Depressive Disorder
  * Childhood-based PTSD
  * Substance Use Disorder (SUD)
  * Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)
  * Generalized Anxiety
* Physical:
  * Sports-related knee trauma
  * Lower lumbar fracture
* Other:
  * Autism Spectrum

### Pre-Medication State

Today's testing conditions weren't ideal, but they provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate Stay Puft's effectiveness under stress. After my standard 5-hour reset period, I found myself in a particularly challenging state. Twelve hours of intensive review writing had my lumbar fracture screaming, and the combination of Wellbutrin and too much coffee in a crowded caf√© had my anxiety peaked.

**Pre-Medication Metrics:**

**Pain Level: 7/10**
* Context: Extended sitting (12 hours) during review writing
* Location: Primary lower back discomfort

**Anxiety Level: 9/10**
* Contributing Factors:
  * Excessive caffeine intake
  * Wellbutrin medication
  * Crowded, noisy environment
* Symptoms: Fidgety, environmental discomfort

**Mood Level: 5/10**
* Baseline (typically trends negative)
* Notable: Political content fatigue

**Energy Level: 5/10**
* State: Post-caffeine decline
* Note: Not experiencing lethargy

The environment actually worked in our favor for testing - when you're reviewing something for anxiety relief, being in an anxiety-inducing situation provides valuable data points. The pain levels, while uncomfortable for me personally, gave us a solid baseline for measuring relief potential.

### Consumption Experience & Sensory Journey

The ritual began with rolling 0.5g into a 1¬º ZigZag cone - my standard method for consistency in reviews. Even before lighting it was tasty; The dry pull was candy-like sweetness. 

The initial hits brought forward the vanilla and berry notes promised by the Marshmallow OG and Grape Gasoline genetics, but with a complexity that built throughout the session. By the halfway point, something interesting - the emergence of distinct tootsie roll notes, followed by unexpected but delightful cinnamon undertones. Strange but true. The resin production was so substantial that relighting became necessary - a quality issue I'm happy to have.

### Effects Timeline

**Immediate Onset:**
The effects announced themselves in classic fashion - that familiar sensation behind the eyes that veterans know well. What happened next was unexpected from my experience with THCa flower. A wave of relief literally washed down my back and into my feet, the kind of effect I usually associate with classic indicas. Powerful therapeutic effects.

**20-Minute Mark:**
* Pain relief holding strong
* Anxiety dropping to manageable levels
* Mood noticeably elevated - catching myself smiling for no particular reason
* Freedom of movement improved significantly

**Overall Character:**
While it's classified as a hybrid, this leans heavily into indica territory in terms of effects. Don't get me wrong - you're not getting couch-locked, but the pain-killing properties are front and center. What's impressive is getting this level of relief without the mental fog.

### Final Metrics & Impact

**Post-Medication Results:**

**Pain: 3/10** (-4)
The most impressive aspect. This level of pain relief from hemp flower is rare.

**Anxiety: 5/10** (-4)
Brought me back to baseline despite being in an anxiety-triggering environment.

**Mood: 9/10** (+4)
Significant elevation without feeling artificial or forced.

**Energy: 6/10** (+1)
Slight boost, mainly from increased comfort and mobility.

What stands out is how this hits like classic, quality cannabis should. The effects are clean, well-rounded, and surprisingly potent for ""hemp"" flower. For those managing pain and anxiety while maintaining recovery, this could be a game-changer. Classic chest gripping potency if you want it.

## Final Assessment

### Therapeutic Applications & Effectiveness

üè• **Medical Benefits Analysis**

After extensive testing, Stay Puft demonstrates exceptional versatility across multiple therapeutic applications. The strain's balanced profile makes it particularly valuable for patients managing multiple conditions simultaneously.

**Primary Applications:**

**Pain & Physical Relief:**
* Chronic musculoskeletal pain
* Inflammation management
* Lower back issues
* Sports-related injuries
* Muscle tension and spasms
* Joint discomfort
* Improved mobility
* Maintains mental clarity during pain relief

**Mental Health Support:**
* Anxiety reduction without sedation

### Overall Therapeutic Value

What sets Stay Puft apart is its exceptional balance. While many hemp or THCa strains excel in specific areas but fall short in others, this cultivar delivers comprehensive relief:
* Pain management without mental fog
* Anxiety reduction while maintaining functionality
* Natural mood elevation without artificial highs
* Physical relief without sedation
* Improved mobility without energy crashes

The combination of Marshmallow OG and Grape Gasoline genetics translates remarkably well to hemp flower, offering medical patients a viable alternative to traditional cannabis while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

### Value Assessment

At $100 a quarter (shipped), this sits in Crysp's Tier 1 category. Is it worth it? For patients managing multiple conditions who need to maintain clarity while finding relief, absolutely. For someone who is willing to pay a little extra for real quality? Absolutely. 

The quality matches or exceeds many options in my medical program, and the effects justify the premium pricing.

üë• **Best Suited For:**
* Pain management patients seeking clarity
* Anxiety sufferers needing reliable relief
* Those in recovery requiring strong effects without THC
* Medical patients looking for a daytime alternative
* Anyone needing serious relief while staying functional

‚ö†Ô∏è **Less Suited For:**
* Those seeking pure energy boost
* Users wanting heavy sedation
* Patients requiring deep sleep aid
* Budget-conscious buyers

## A Note to Medical Patients

As someone straddling both worlds - a long-term cannabis user and medical patient who now maintains recovery through carefully selected strains - I feel compelled to address something important. Traditional medical programs, while valuable, aren't the only source of legitimate, potent medicine. Stay Puft, testing at around 25% THC while remaining Farm Bill compliant, proves this point conclusively.

### Breaking Down Barriers

Throughout this review, you've seen numerous references to medical applications. This isn't to exclude recreational users - Stay Puft is excellent for general enjoyment - but rather to highlight something significant: Farm Bill compliant cannabis can absolutely match medical program quality.

üí° **Why This Matters:**
* High-quality, potent options exist outside medical programs
* Farm Bill compliance doesn't mean compromising on effects
* Price comparisons favor these alternative markets
* Quality control matches or exceeds many medical programs
* Accessibility for patients without medical cards

### Evidence in Experience

The effects documented in this review (-4 pain, -4 anxiety, +4 mood) came from a strain testing near 30% THC that's fully compliant with federal law. This matters because it demonstrates that patients have legitimate alternatives to traditional medical programs while maintaining the same level of potency and effect.

### Quality Markers

What makes Stay Puft stand out:
* High THC content (‚âà25%) while maintaining compliance
* Complete terpene preservation
* Professional cultivation standards
* True genetic authenticity
* Effects that don't just rival but often exceed medical program offerings

This isn't about replacing medical programs - it's about recognizing that Farm Bill compliant cannabis has evolved to provide legitimate, potent options that deserve consideration in any patient's toolkit.

*Note: Every patient's needs are unique. This review aims to provide data points for informed decision-making, not medical advice.*

### Final Verdict

Stay Puft represents what hemp flower can be when treated with the same respect and attention as traditional cannabis. Crysp has managed to capture the essence of a 25% THC strain in a compliant hemp flower, maintaining the sophisticated terpene profile and effects while eliminating concerns about THC content.

For patients like myself, managing multiple conditions while maintaining recovery, this kind of effective alternative is invaluable. It's a premium product at a premium price point, but it delivers premium results.

I however never learned how to swim or ride a bike, despite my parents ‚Äú trying‚Äù to teach me. Things take me alot longer to pick up than other people, and I am an emotional mess the entire time and absolutely beyond burnt afterwards. 

I was never able to pick up driving. Took driving lessons and passed and everything but the act of driving destroyssss me. If I drive to a coffee shop for example, by the time I am there I am so overstimulated and emotionally burnt I can‚Äôt actually sit down and do anything. This eventually lead to me basically blacking out behind the wheel multiple times from I assume over stimulation. 

While there are many things I can‚Äôt do, I still am objectively capable. I graduated highschool with a 4.0 & went to college ( 1st gen too) and graduated top of my major with a 3.9 whist also maintaining a job and paying my own bills such as tuition and rent. 

Even with all that though, I can‚Äôt manage to take the bus alone without it being such a mental hassle. I have worked a few jobs but they are always walking distance from where I live and I now can‚Äôt manage find a job like that. A high college GPA means nothing when ur unemployed. 

Anyway all to say, when I think about doing things like riding a bike, taking the bus, or working somewhere that isn‚Äôt exactly what I have done before it all feels impossible & it‚Äôs leading me to living a very unfulfilled life as well as not having any money bc I can‚Äôt find a job lol

Hey MaximizeMe fam! So, picture this: It's 8 PM, you're staring at your to-do list with a cup of lukewarm coffee in hand, and it still looks like a novella that somehow keeps adding chapters. Sound familiar? üòÖ

We‚Äôve all been there. Working late, feeling frazzled, and wondering if there's a magic trick. Spoiler alert: There isn't. But there *is* this magical little concept called a **growth mindset** that can shake things up almost overnight!

**What‚Äôs a growth mindset, you ask?** It‚Äôs this brilliant idea championed by psychologist Carol Dweck. It‚Äôs about believing you can develop your skills and talents through effort, teaching us to work smarter, not harder.

**Here‚Äôs how shifting your mindset can boost your productivity:**

1. **Failure Becomes Your BFF**  
   Uh-huh, that‚Äôs right. Once you start seeing failures as stepping stones instead of roadblocks, you're free to experiment and *really* learn. Remember when Thomas Edison said he didn‚Äôt fail 1,000 times with the light bulb, but just found 1,000 ways that didn‚Äôt work? Yeah, be like Edison‚Äîminus the electricity bill. üîå

2. **Every Day‚Äôs a School Day**  
   Instead of stressing about being perfect, focus on improving. Missed a deadline? Learn from it. Skill gap? Find a YouTube tutorial. Every ""mistake"" is just a learning opportunity in disguise.

3. **Flex That Brain Like a Muscle**  
   Ever think your brain‚Äôs like a muscle? The more you use it and challenge it, the stronger it gets. Try new things, read different genres, or even pick up a doodle habit. You‚Äôd be surprised at how it boosts your creativity at work!

4. **Celebrate Tiny Wins**  
   Seriously, treat your daily wins like confetti. Did you knock one thing off that colossal to-do list? Nice! Big things are built from tons of tiny achievements. üçæ

Now, I get it. Shifting your mindset isn‚Äôt like flipping a light switch. But remember, the inventor of the light bulb likely had one heck of a *growth* mindset to begin with. üòâ

Have you guys tried embracing a growth mindset before? What‚Äôs a small win you‚Äôre proud of today? Let's keep this convo going! üéâ",1,1739070311.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am almost ready to go the divorce mediation route. But what I want is a sweet and sexy marriage. I want a strong home base for my kids and more rest and joy for me (not able to think about H's joy right now).

 This weekend was to be our anniversary celebration weekend. H had organized kids to sleepover at friends, a movie, a dinner, family photoshoot, etc. 

But. He fell sick again on Wednesday. As you know, he had fallen sick 3 weeks ago and it meant a lot of screaming and bad words from him to me. Later he admitted to being unkind and apologized. I received and then gave the drama no oxygen. He regretted his verbal abuse and swore for the first time in 10 years that ""these bad words stop now"". But, being sick again this weekend and his expectations not being met, he jumped right back into anger, rage, swearing at me awfully in front of kids, passive aggression, throwing his coffee at the wall, etc. I had put a lot more effort to make him feel taken care of, this week though. But it's not valued, bu the goal posts keep moving for me, and angrily so.

He later apologized for ""making me cry"" and did ask if I still want to go to the movie with him. I again received (with resentment in my heart). The movie failed since I had a headache and said I want to leave half way, then changed my mind. So he left and waited outside the hall for me. We did not do dinner. He is still extremely mad at me for not caring for him in the way he expects. 

I have apologized for disrespect I showed when I took bait at one point. But we are sleeping in seperate rooms. I have done  EPD, vulnerability and DT and listening. But he says he us unable to let go of his anger, he's that mad at me. This is quite typical. Another  opportunity for closeness wasted because of his anger and righteousness.

I am so mad that he abuses me and then I am apologizing and he is angry at me. He holds on to the anger for days and thinks nothing of abusing me in front of the kids. Upsetting us all, throwing things in anger. It's too volatile for my comfort. 

We have has no PI now for 2 months. I'm DT about it since I know a SOTU doesn't work, from experience. 

I don't have a support system of family or many friends to walk me through this. Just a couple of friends. I believe in marriage and good family values. So does H. But my neighbours hear his shouting regularly. 

I don't want my kids to think this is a normal, good marriage or to repeat this. I want more joy and don't want my peace to be stolen at his whim. But I don't want my kids to grow up with lesser money, fewer opportunities and the big trauma of divorce. 

How do I get off the fence? I want to jump on the side of marriage. But I see no hope. It's like being married to a good paycheck and a lot of household help (I also earn equally, but i appreciate his income a lot). But my soul is starved, my sisters. Please help me find the hope, if there is any.

I have a lot of thoughts about this issue that i would like to share. 

First of all, being ‚Äùgirly‚Äù or ‚Äùfeminine‚Äù is not 1 thing. if you are a girl then you are automatically girly and feminine. it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, it doesn‚Äôt retract from your gender. ‚Äùfeminine‚Äù can also mean different things to different people. *we don‚Äôt know you and what you consider girly*. Nobody can tell you how you should act. 

Secondly, a lot of people who do answer these questions write things like ‚Äùlisten to pop music, drink starbucks, wear high heels, exfoliate in the shower‚Äù and it‚Äôs like??? okay??? good that it makes YOU feel girly but there is nothing inherently feminine about those things. Does that mean that girls who listen to metal, wear flip flops, don‚Äôt like coffee and don‚Äôt exfoliate aren‚Äôt feminine? why is pop music more feminine than soul or rap? *why is femininity categorized?* 

I‚Äôm infinitely tired of these posts. you ARE a girl. even if you never shave and hate lady gaga and hate coffee and have short hair and don‚Äôt wear skirts and love cars YOU. ARE. FEMININE. ENOUGH. and your actions don‚Äôt make you less feminine. and these things everyone comments about are not inherently feminine. stop trying to live your life according to arbitrary rules and just do whatever you feel like you want to do.

I am a feminine girl. i will never listen to chapell roan or collect lip balms. i will keep being feminine no matter what i do. and i will not ask other people how i should change, and i will not tell other girls that they need to do specific things to be more girly. that‚Äôs toxic.

I've had so many hyperfixations.  If I played a video game based on a movie, I had to watch the movie and know everything about it. I was immersed into the Titanic wreck in 1995, Garfield the cat, how commercial aircraft are built, the list goes on. 

Math was never my strong suit.  Once I got into Algebra, I would almost have a meltdown looking at the equations.  My mind would ""shut off"" and I couldn't absorb what was being taught. 

Now that I have a better understanding of what ADHD really is, I'm going to get the official diagnosis.  My concerns are the meds.  If I'm on a stimulant like Adderall, do I give up coffee?  My family has a history of heart disease.  Could my chances of a heart attack increase?  On that note, I don't drink or smoke but, I do eat a lot of sugar.  

What was your experience with stimulant and non-stimunlant meds?  Did the executive disfunction stop while on meds?

I have a Breville oracle touch that has had some issues as of recent. It all started one day by making a very loud noise (much louder than normal) while powered off. Only unplugging the machine from the wall would stop the noise. It would not brew at this point as the temperature would not go past 70 degrees but the steamer still worked and so did the hot water.

After trying to diagnose, the noise stopped but then so did the hot water and steamer. Brew temp stayed at 70-80 degrees and the steamer temp read ready but nothing.

Going into advanced settings and debug mode showed a Coffee boiler NTC not responding and communication errors.

Clicking hot water would turn on the pump but no water came out. Clicking the steam feature emitted a faint hum but no steam. I checked the all points on the solenoids with a volt meter while turning hot water and steam on and off and no changes on any pins. 

I took the main triac board off from the top and found this..(see pic). I believe this is the culprit and board is cooked which explains why it was making loud noises even though it was turned off and now why nothing else works. 

While apart I checked all the lines off the steam boiler and coffee boiler and everything is clean and water flows to and from as it should. 

Does the diagnosis sound correct? Does anyone know where I can get a replacement 120v triac board for this? I have seen a couple 240v from Aus and NZ on Ebay and the like but nothing for the 120v.

 I am also planning on contacting Breville this week for parts, do they sell the triac boards? Thank you.",2,1739068454.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

These were a clusterfrick of a process. Tried to cold process which quickly turned into hot process method...due to 15¬∞ weather I got instant volcanoes/foam and false trace.
Fought the batch for an hr or so...then let it sit for a couple days, and rebatched it.

Lye
Lard
Coffee
Kratom
Sunflower oil
Extra virgin olive oil
Psychotria Viridis leaf
2 useless small soy wax melts that likely burnt up
Oxidized/DeAd cocoa/Shea butter and eczema lotion


The candles are just lard and various discounted wax melts scented with different cedar/fir wood. Smells like a forest basically.

Move-in date is scheduled for 2/20. Rent including my discount is at $975/month per person.

Utilities are not included in the rent, but there is free WiFi. Water, sewer, garbage, gas, and electricity will be split in half. Street parking is available and there is reserved parking in a gated lot available for $150/month. My current apartment is fully furnished, besides the 2nd bedroom. However, I‚Äôd love to collaborate with my new roommate if they have their own furniture. 

I have 2 dogs and 2 cats, so the new roommate must be pet-friendly. Unfortunately, there is no room for more animals. 

Some things I‚Äôm looking for in a roommate:
* Mature & communicative
* Clean (picks up after themselves in shared spaces)
* 420-friendly
* Accepting & open-minded

Some more details about me:
* Liberal, accepting, clean 33 year old highly-functioning stoner (she/her)
* Full-time employee (works Tuesday-Saturday)
* Planning to move to WA in one year to live w/ boyfriend (boyfriend visits for the weekend about twice a month)

More details about the apartment & community:
* New building close to Fred Meyer, Trader Joe‚Äôs, Target, and a seasonal farmer‚Äôs market - not far from Nike, Intel, and local transit
* Near tons of great restaurants, bars, and local businesses - shares retail space with an awesome pizza place & coffee shop
* Secure building with keyless entry
* Apartment is 2B/2B with full-size appliances, including W/D, heating & cooling, hardwood vinyl flooring, and both rooms have walk-in closets
* You must submit an application and sign a 12-month lease to become a resident, which means you will be subject to a background check and rental screening

This is a very unique situation, and is definitely not a good fit for everyone, but it would be great for someone looking to save some money and live close to work. I will provide the name of the property and the address to serious inquiries. Please send me a DM if you‚Äôre interested.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Steve Earle once said, "" Townes Van Zandt is America's greatest songwriter. And I would stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table with my boots on and say that."" In a Rolling Stone magazine article.

To which Townes, who was still amongst the living funnily said, "" I've seen Bob's body guards. I don't think you'll make it to the coffee table.,"" ü§£

Not long after saying that, Steve ended up opening for Bob, and Bob didn't talk to him about it, I m not sure if he talked to him much at all, but Bob obviously has a day in who his opening act is. And Bob's only response was to play "" Pancho and Lefty"" on the opening night of the tour. 

As if to say, ""it's art, it's not a competition , I like Townes too."" 

Steve's remark was basically a somewhat back handed compliment, "" yeah, I know everyone else thinks Bob is, and I myself have even covered Bob, but I'm singing Townes' praises."" And I think that is the way Bob took it, to Bob's  credit.

But it must be hard, being declared the BEST, to the point where people trying not to appear to be syncophants, even if they think it themselves ( critics). Or people, like Steve, favorably compare another songwriter to you, even name checking you, just because YOU are the benchmark. 

It reminds me of Bob's MusicCares speech, paraphrasing "" what makes me so special? I don't annunciate? You ever listen to Muddy Waters? I sound like I gargle with drano? You ever listen to Tom Waits or Charley Patton? What makes me so special?"" 

I haven't met him, but, I think he is actually quite humble. "" Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft"" ( if you see her say hello),  but as a Dylan fan, even I'm defensive on his behalf when they put him on a pedestal and then proceeds to try to knock him off of it. I'm glad he lived long enough to just have critics stop taking pot shots at him.Just to defend themselves and their critiques , as not being syncophants or syncophantic of their own hero   And just sing his praises.

My mothers coughing sent me into an almost uncontrollable reaction. I feel weird. Was this normal to happen? (advice please!),"Without going into details too much. I'm 31 and still living with my retired parents. I'm saving for an apartment and have about 6-10 months left until I will realistically be in a strong position to begin looking for something of my own. Knowing this is the only thing keeping me from absolutely losing my mind. And I don't even know what that would look like.

I spend a decent amount of time at work. I also do stuff like go to the gym. Then there's the usual life stuff like running errands and shopping. Visiting friends etc.

I am still here at the house with my retired parents a lot though. It's just how it is. I try to keep myself out of the house, but it's not always realistically possible unless I have somewhere to be or an idea to pursue (buying lunch etc.)

My mother coughs and sighs about 1000 times a day. It's always sudden and sharp and loud. She never stops. She is also a heavy smoker and drinks every night, some nights getting drunk.

Today I fucking snapped. I've never had this happen. I spent the first 3 hours of the day watching crap on my laptop, had a few coffees, ate lunch and cleaned up, and prepared some things for my day tomorrow. Today is one of those days I genuinely don't need to leave the house for anything.

Well, she was coughing and sighing and closing doors harder than needed all through this morning period since I woke up. I was in my bedroom putting some things into a dresser and packing a bag when I heard her coughing loudly and persistently and I realized that this is all I had heard all morning. I then stopped what I was doing and sort of looked around my bedroom in somewhat of a panic. I actually said out loud 'stop'. Her coughing continued. I just started shaking and then punching the air and then bit my fucking finger and slapped myself in the side of the head a few times. This all lasted for like 10 seconds. I then was seeing stars and couldn't believe what had just happened to me. My response was overwhelming, and I've never done it before. Like, how did this come up so suddenly where I literally had no control. I was 'seeing red' in terms of how angry I felt. I could have punched through a door at the peak.

I'm now stressing that I'm have undiagnosed autism or ADHD or something idk. Idk wtf happened. I feel so fucking stupid. I can't believe her coughing is doing this to me. I wear noise cancelling headphones most of the time while at home in my bedroom. It's not always shielding me though.",10,1739067382.0,misophonia,3,0.82,False

**1. Texas**  
Texas is where it‚Äôs at, man. With cities like Austin and Dallas, you're lookin' at a population that just keeps growing, and they need places to crash. Dive into those zoning laws and keep tabs on infrastructure projects ‚Äì like that new highway or public transit line ‚Äì 'cause they can seriously spike property values. Chatting up local agents at meetups could land you that off-market gem.

**2. Arizona**  
Arizona's got a sweet spot with Phoenix and Tucson. There's a ton of new tech companies settling in, so you wanna keep an eye on areas with upcoming developments or transportation improvements. Grab a coffee with local investors or hit up regional real estate conferences to get the lowdown on what's poppin' in the market.

**3. Florida**  
From Miami to Orlando, Florida's more than just beaches and theme parks. The housing market is booming thanks to a growing population and low vacancy rates. Keep your ear to the ground for rental market trends and properties near commercial projects ‚Äì those could be your golden ticket.

**4. Georgia**  
Atlanta and its 'burbs are heating up! Focus on neighborhoods going thru urban revitalization or gentrification ‚Äì that's where the magic happens. Hang out with contractors and developers to get early access to properties before they hit the mainstream market.

**5. Tennessee**  
Nashville is buzzing with young professionals, which means housing demand is climbing. Look for areas with new schools or community developments; they're usually indicators of rising property values. And don‚Äôt forget those local real estate auctions ‚Äì you might snag a distressed property that‚Äôs ripe for flipping.

**6. North Carolina**  
Between Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina is all about tech growth and universities bringing in new residents. Target properties near these tech hubs for some high appreciation potential. Swing by local chamber of commerce meetings for insider info on future developments.

**7. Colorado**  
Colorado‚Äôs not just about mountains and skiing. Denver's job growth and eco-friendly vibe make it a hot investment spot. Check out properties in sustainable developments ‚Äì buyers love that stuff ‚Äì and stay in tune with local legislation that might affect real estate trends there.

1il45sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1il45sg/ritalin_is_this_working/,Ritalin - Is This Working?,"So, I just finished my my first day on ritalin, after taking my first dose last night, and I'm still trying to figure out if this is working.   My therapist gave me a quick release pill of 10 miligrams.

He told me to up the dose gradually, up to 20 miligrams ,depending on what dose I most found effective.

**First Dose-**

I broke it in half and took 5 miligrams last night, and felt ok. I was able to work on my thesis for probably about 4 hours straight. Instead of writing something new, though, I got caught up in making clear an insight I suddenly had about a previous section. I think it was a meaningful accomplishment to realize what I realized, but it was also me getting sucked down another rabbit-hole, instead of making real progress on creating a finished product.

**Second Dose-**

I took it this morning before I went to work. I'm a tour guide. I took 10 miligrams in the morning and felt ok. I did seem to be able to keep myself in a flow and rhythm with my speeches, in a way that I don't always achieve.

Apart from being a bit better with my tours, I was also able to be more intentional with my coworkers today, engaging them in conversation in a way that was also more sensitive to their feelings and reactions. I'm still having the same old trouble with maintaining eye-contact, but for whatever reason, possibly a placebo, I was more mindful of looking at them when they spoke.

But I also had a bit of a manic quality to my behavior today. There's a mild euphoria I'm having, a calmness in my body, that I'm worried is just me being high. There's a bit of a vibration in my limbs that you get sometimes during a good high, if anyone knows what I'm taking about.

My stimming has reduced, I didn't rub my hands, or rock my leg, or other things while I was sitting as much, but it hasn't gone away completely. I often have an issue with moving my hands and arms around when I'm giving a tour, to the extent that I sometimes hide them behind my back to let me beat out a rhythm. I didn't have to put my arms behind me today, but I was still moving my arms up and down to emphasize points and accentuate the rhythm in a way that I couldn't completely control.

I'm not sure how much of any of that is the drug, and how much its me wanting the drug to work and so just choosing not to stim.

**Third Dose-**

In the afternoon, I took 20 miligrams, and have had only a slight improvement from the previous dose, though I am a bit more ""stimulated.""

I'm sitting here, after having made myself a tunafish sandwich dinner. I didn't eat all day. I've actually done that many times before at work when we're busy. But today we were slow, and I thought about going to get something to eat, but instead I just sat on a bench and stared at my phone, continuing to tinker with what I did last night on my thesis.

I had a lot of joy doing that, honestly, it felt pretty great at times in a way that was unusual and made me smile. My thesis makes me happy, its the kind of thing I was meant to do, but I don't usually feel that in such a front and center way. I was also just mostly working on the same paragraph, trying to make it work, so it was a bit of a hyper focus.

But that's also the kind of thing that can happen when you're on a stimulant high. I don't have a lot of experience with stimulants. I never did coke, and for some fucking reason never took the adderal that was being passed around in college, so maybe this is something different from that, but I can't tell.

I have a real urge to finally clean my disgusting apartment, while I'm sitting here and writing this, but again, that's also me kind of just wanting this medication to be working.

**I'm So Excited-**

There is also the fact that I'm still very excited to have realized that I have this condition, and how thrilled I am to be taking medication to finally treat it. I'm happy just having the bottle.

I'm sure plenty of you can relate. Everything about my life suddenly makes so much more sense. What makes that so much more meaningful, is that there's something I can do about it.

That itself might be making it a bit hard to calm down. I got into a bit of a fight and had a real emotional reaction (emotional dysregulation) with my pharmacy when they were a couple days late in filling the prescription, they might think I'm a drug addict.

I've had such a reevaluation of so many things since my shrink explained the condition more to me. It only took two sessions for them to convince me I had it, and they really only had to suggest it, and explain that it wasn't always associated with hyperactivity. Since then, I've had so many eureka moments, tracing whfat I thought were just oddities about myself, or failings, and realizing it was ADHD all along. I'm sure plenty of other people in this subreddit know, its hard to even express how dramatically your perspective can change after realizing you have this.

Its only been a month.

I know why I say ""what"" when people talk to me now. I know why I destroyed so many chairs growing up. I know why I can only write and do work when I'm in a public place. I know why I struggled so much with waking up when I was younger. I know why I now set alarms an hour ahead of when I need to wake up.

I've tried to deny it, of course, but deep down, I always thought I was just lazy, or lacked will power. This changes everything.

**What I Haven't Had Yet-**

But, I don't have the sudden clarity yet that others have reported, and that I was REALLY HOPING FOR, of my mind calming down, and suddenly being able to be more present. At least, I don't think I do. I haven't had a chance yet to do something like sit down in a coffee shop to see if anything feels different. My work has a lot of chaos and things to keep me stimulated, in a way that works for my ADHD, so I also haven't necessarily had a chance yet to see if I can allow my mind to calm down.

I've been half-listening to a youtube video as I wrote all this, there's still the need to distract myself, or keep my brain extra-occupied, or whatever causes me to do things like that.

If you're one of the unfortunate people who read some or most of this, you can probably tell I'm still having a bit of manic reaction, though its calmed as I wrote this. I did just take my fourth dose, an hour ago, when I got home.

I am on another medication, a pretty heavy dose of pregabalin, 600 miligrams a day, for anxiety. So that also probably has something to do with why I'm maybe feeling a bit high. I've been on it for a month, but the effects of relaxation are probably coming through in a way they weren't before. That could explain the manic reaction. I've had that to an extent before. Pregabalin stops your brain from producing a certain fear chemical, so just having that suddenly removed can create a bit of a wild feeling if you're someone who has anxiety, your grip is suddenly loosened.

**TLDR-** I'm not really sure how to sort out what's a placebo effect, and what's just normal drug stimulation, and what's me actually getting help with my adhd. I'm just wondering if anyone can help me sort out some of these feelings and sensations.

I'm going to get up now, and see if I still want to clean my apartment. I may provide an update.",1,1739067181.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False
