1qfujrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/1qfujrm/looking_for_cashpaid_odd_jobs_in/,"Looking for Cash‑Paid Odd Jobs in Burlington/Winooski/Near by (Cleaning, Lifting, etc.)","Hi neighbors, I’m looking to pick up some cash‑paid, no‑fuss work in the Burlington/Winooski area. I already work full‑time and go to school full‑time, so my schedule can get a little busy, but I’m flexible and can usually make almost any time work depending on what’s in my calendar. I’m not looking for anything social,  I’m the type to keep my head down, do the job, and head out.

I’m reliable, respectful, and not easily grossed out. Messy spaces, tough jobs, or awkward situations don’t bother me. I also work fast and efficiently, my goal is always to get the job done right and as quickly as possible without missing details or cutting corners.

I’m straightforward and easy to coordinate with. Just send me the details, and I’ll confirm what works. I respect your space and privacy, I don’t judge, I don’t snoop, and I keep things to myself. I work independently, so once you tell me what needs doing, I take it from there.

What I Can Help With

• House Cleaning & Organizing  

Deep cleans, routine cleaning, kitchens, bathrooms, move‑in/out, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, folding laundry, etc. I can use your supplies or mine.

• Pet Sitting & Dog Walking  

Drop‑ins, feeding, litter box cleaning, walks, basic meds, and overnight stays if needed. Comfortable with all kinds of pets, including seniors and anxious animals.

• Odd Jobs & Handy Tasks  

– Moving/lifting help  

– Packing/unpacking  

– Light repairs (bulbs, patching, picture hanging, etc)  

– Furniture assembly (IKEA, shelves, bikes, etc.)  

– Basic tech help (Wi‑Fi issues, device setup)  

– Errands (mailing packages, small grocery runs, pickups)

• Seasonal Work  

– Snow shoveling  

– Light sanding/salting  

– Yard cleanup (leaves, bagging, seasonal prep)  

– House check‑ins while you’re away (mail, plants, lights, etc.)

Availability

Because of work and school, my schedule shifts week to week, but I’m happy to work around that. If you message me with what you need and when, I can usually find a time that fits. I’m open to one‑time jobs or ongoing help if you need someone regularly.

Logistics

I don’t have a car yet, so for jobs requiring heavy equipment or large hauling, we may need to coordinate. For cleaning, I prefer using your supplies to keep things simple. If needed, I could use mine.

If it helps with planning or meeting beforehand, I’m totally fine meeting at a coffee shop or any open public place, so we can go over details comfortably.

Rates

Most jobs start around $15–$20/hr, depending on the task, but I’m flexible. Heavier labor, deep cleaning, or last‑minute rush jobs may be a little higher, but I always try to keep things fair and reasonable. If you’re on a tight budget, feel free to tell me, I’d rather work something out than have you stress about the cost.  

For recurring jobs (like weekly cleaning, regular pet visits, or ongoing help), I offer discounted rates since consistency makes scheduling easier on both sides. I’m also open to flat‑rate pricing for certain tasks if that’s easier for you.

Important Note (Phone Number Update)

Something happened to my old phone, and I no longer have access to the contacts that were saved on it. If you were a past client or had my old number, please DM me, Id love to reconnect if you still need help.

Contact

Send me a PM with:  

• What you need done  

• Your general location  

• When you’d like it done  

Thanks for reading, have a wonderful day! (⁠\~⁠\_⁠\~⁠メ⁠)",1,1768698395.0,burlington,0,1.0,False
1qfuj38,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qfuj38/armless_woman/,armless woman,"No one remembered ever seeing the woman with arms.

She moved through the city with the quiet certainty of someone who had adapted long ago. Her shoulders ended smoothly beneath her clothes, her silhouette uninterrupted, natural. Even in sleeveless tops or fitted dresses, there was nothing unusual—no folds, no tension, no signs of concealment. Her body simply stopped where arms were supposed to begin.

People adjusted instinctively around her.

Doors were held open without discussion. Objects were placed within careful reach. Conversations slowed, softened, as if the absence of her arms altered the rhythm of the room. She accepted all of it calmly, without gratitude or resistance. This was not dependence. It was routine.

Her name was Helen.

She lived alone in a small apartment and followed precise habits. She shopped at the same market, crossed the same streets, drank coffee at the same café each morning. The barista tilted the cup toward her so she could lean forward and drink. Helen smiled every time, not because she needed the help—but because the interaction felt correct.

Nothing about her suggested tragedy.

She was not bitter. Not fragile. Not angry at the world. If anything, she seemed centered, grounded, almost peaceful. People noticed this. They often thought she was *strong*, in a quiet way, for someone without arms.

At home, her apartment reflected the same reality. Surfaces were low. Objects were secured. Tools were designed for pressure, balance, and weight rather than grip. Anyone entering would have left without doubt: this was a woman who had lived her entire life armless.

Only after the door was locked did anything change.

Helen stood still in the center of the room and reached for a hidden clasp beneath her clothing.

The smooth line of her torso split open—not in flesh, but in structure. A rigid vest, custom-shaped to her body, loosened its hold. Slowly, deliberately, she removed it. The pressure released in stages, like a breath finally exhaled.

Her arms unfolded from where they had been held.

They were real. Intact. Strong.

Helen looked at them without surprise.

She had never felt like they were missing. She had simply chosen not to live with them.

The vest was not a costume. It was not a disguise meant for others. It was a mask meant for herself. When she wore it, her body aligned with how she felt—contained, quiet, complete. Without arms, her movements became intentional. Her presence became lighter. The world asked less of her.

With arms, everything demanded something.

At home, free from the vest, Helen rarely used them. Sometimes she let them rest at her sides for hours, unmoving, as if they were optional features rather than necessities. She felt no urgency to reclaim them.

Outside, she returned to the version of herself that felt most honest.

The woman the world saw was armless.

Got my Micra and Libra in the summer of 2024, but the VS6 is brand new.  Anyway...Love the Micra, and the Libra as well.  The Luminaire Shot Timer was a nice and easy add on.  Overall, no real complaints with the Micra, love the looks, love the function and love the build--the only real gripe I would have is I wish that LM would just add the BBW feature to the software in the Micra instead of intentionally handicapping it that way (and not that I really need it, but it would be nice).  Size-wise, no real issues (with my cups), and no real issues the steam wand using the LM pitcher.  (Although I did swap the tip to a 1.0mm #0 tip.)  

Prior to the Micra, I had a Quick Mill Silvano Evo for a few years...it was a nice machine, but I wanted to upgrade to something with a dual boiler AND a rotary pump.  I also didn't really want an E61 machine, and I don't have lot of under counter space as you can see, so the Micra was almost the de-facto choice...however the style, design and LM build and reputation played a major factor.  

So far...no regrets!

Hour 1

Saturday January 17th 9PM CST Stan Deyo

Topic: UFO’s/UAP’s

Stan Deyo is a UFO researcher on propulsion systems. He has held Above Top-Secret Security Clearance and worked undercover for the FBI. He was part of an exclusive “black project”, headed by Dr. Edward Teller specializing in the development of “flying saucer technology”.

Born in Clifton, Texas to a family of American Pioneers, Stan spent his first two years in nearby Valley Mills with his grandparents until his father returned from the Middle East – a US Army Air Force Base Commander in WW2. Valley Mills is just seven miles from Crawford, home to President Bush’s ranch.

Stan spent most of his youth in Dallas where (while at J. F. Kimball H.S.) he was a member of the National Honor Society, Captain of the rifle team, Lt. Colonel in the NDCC (ROTC), recipient of the Sons of the American Revolution Medal, and honored as one of the two most outstanding math students.

Graduating high school just three months after his 16th birthday, Stan was awarded a partial engineering scholarship to the University of Texas and also was given a full congressional appointment (scholarship) to the US Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs. He was the only 4th class cadet who received written permission from General Curtis E. LeMay (head of S.A.C. at the time) to drink coffee and sit at ease during meals – which was not the norm for 4th class cadets.

Upon returning to Dallas from USAFA, Stan trained in computer programming, systems analysis and operations at IBM. Shortly thereafter, he formed his own “mission impossible” team solving extremely sensitive, difficult corporate computing problems.

Stan’s main love is still advanced propulsion and “free” energy research which took him to Australia in ’71 to work on these systems as part of a global project under the direction of such men as Dr. Edward Teller and Dr Andrei Sakharov.

In 1969, Stan experienced an NDE which only strengthened his Faith, though at the time, he was not a Believer. We met with Hopi elders of the Shungopavi Village in Arizona twice by invitation to discuss prophecy.

In 1996 we visited the restricted access FNMOC at the US Navy base in Monterey to share Stan’s method of earthquake prediction (based on sea surface temperature anomalies – something Stan formulated from the Navy’s own data but they had not seen this use for it until he showed them.) For 10 years he made earthquake forecasts using their data with an accuracy of about 70% and a lead time of 1-7 days. Sadly, in 2006 the Naval data stream was classified; so Stan had to abandon this project.

At Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs (now headquartered in Omaha), we met with Major Green, affectionately known as “Major Meteor” by his colleagues, to discuss the probability of meteors impacting Earth. Stan has packed more into 80 years than most folks do in two lifetimes!

Stan’s scientific approach is backed by extensive research. He is not motivated to make a “quick buck”, nor is he trying to sell anything other than his books that are treasured by those who have them. He feels obliged to let the public know both what he sees from a scientific perspective as well as from Biblical research.

As strange as this might sound, on occasion, Stan has what he calls dream/visions. They do not happen often, maybe once every few years and initially, they only involved him or the immediate family. Now his dream/visions are becoming more frequent and involve other folks, other countries. My first “proof” of his abilities was his dream/vision where he “saw” me as his wife, his partner in life, and exactly where I lived several months before we’d even met!

We did, in fact, meet as a result of one of Stan’s early appearances on Art Bell’s radio program Coast To Coast AM. If you knew our details and the fact that we were living 12,000 miles apart, you’d appreciate the near-impossibility of this, but it DID come true.

Hour 2 Guest

Saturday January 17th 10PM CST Ronald Mallett

Topic: Time Travel/Physics

Ronald Mallett, Ph.D., is a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Connecticut. He is also a member of both the American Physical Society and the National Society of Black Physicists. He has a BS, MS, and PhD in physics from Pennsylvania State University. The oldest of four children, Ron’s life changed forever when his beloved father died of a heart attack. The ten-year-old was overwhelmed with grief-until he read a copy of The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. He was determined to make Wells’ fantasy a reality by going back in time to see his father. 

Remarkably, not only did the boy from the Bronx stick with this vision, becoming one of the country’s few African-American Ph.D.’s in theoretical physics, but Mallett has, according to many peers in the field, developed new theories relating to Einstein’s general theory of relativity that plausibly argue for the existence of time travel into the past. In addition, Ron’s time-travel research has been featured in an hour-long TV special on the Learning Channel, “The World’s First Time Machine.”

1qfugut,https://i.redd.it/iwh729crb0eg1.jpeg,Confusing Days / Part 57,"What is Kazuya doing?

Will Chizuru manage to stand firm?

Ruka Sarashina is summoned for a chat at high school.

\---

\*I will leave the links to the previous parts in the comments. The entire story is joined for better tracking. If you haven't read the previous parts yet, I recommend doing so before starting this chapter.\*

\---

\*\*The first victim fell after receiving a surprise attack from behind; it was a blow that no one saw coming and she could do nothing to avoid it. The thrust was direct and merciless, but it was not enough to make her surrender. Now, wounded, the commander remained on her knees on the ground, motionless, but recovering little by little and thinking about her next move.\*\*

\*\*From a distance, the author of the misfortune received a bit of her own medicine, understanding her current reality with absolute helplessness. The pieces on the board had been reorganized under a new command, starting a new game that promised to be much more challenging than the previous one.\*\*

\---

Wednesday, May 25. Hakkeijima Sea Paradise: Aqua Museum, Labo 1. Yokohama, 10:34 A.M. JST.

\*\*While a new conflict begins to develop in Tokyo that has already claimed its first victim, far from all the chaos lurking in the shadows, the morning sun warmly greets Kazuya's first day of work at the aquarium.\*\*

\*\*Behind him, a typical educational white board is observed, full of notes, colored markers, and several cards with images held by magnets. Despite his effort to maintain his composure, sweat can be seen running down his forehead; nerves and the fear of ruining his first day keep him in a state of constant alert.\*\*

\*\*Suddenly, a small child approached with curiosity to ask about the images. Kazuya, proudly wearing his official uniform, began to explain to him in a clear and simple way how marine life began, the formation of plankton, and even the way reefs are born.\*\*

\*\*Meanwhile, the child's parents observed the entire scene from behind, with deep joy in their eyes seeing their son so attentive, absorbing every word that came out of Kazuya's mouth.\*\*

Kazuya: ""..And with that last part, we have finished with the marine history information that comes in section 1 of your illustrated guide Hajimari no Umi (The Sea of the Beginning). But, as I promised you for behaving so well, now we go with the fun part. Now, listen to me carefully: what I will tell you is top-secret information about some very special animals that I call...""

\*\*Kazuya turned in a comically mysterious way and began to write on the board. Then, looking both ways as if making sure no one else noticed what he had written, he crouched down to the child's height and whispered the name with contagious enthusiasm.\*\*

Kazuya: ""The marine superheroes! Each one is more amazing than the last and they possess unique, very crazy, and impossible powers.""

\*\*In the next instant, Kazuya took some printed images out of his pocket, placed them firmly on the board, and grabbed a black marker, beginning to trace quick drawings around the figures.\*\*

\*\*The child watched everything excitedly, without taking his eyes off the board for a second, something that filled his parents with pride, who commented in low voices from their place.\*\*

\---

Child's father: ""It's a good thing you advised me to record this, honey. This instructor is incredible, truly. I had never seen our little devil so attentive...""

\*\*The mother, who was wiping away some small tears with a handkerchief, answered moved.\*\*

Child's mother: ""I know, I know... My God, I'm melting with love right now. But don't get distracted, keep capturing the moment; we'll send it to his sister. I'm sure she'll love it.""

\---

\*\*Back with Kazuya, who has already finished drawing, he turns around, adjusts his ID badge with determination, takes a breath, and begins to speak with renewed energy and passion.\*\*

Kazuya: ""Everything ready. Now I'll tell you a bit about two animals that seem taken out of a superhero movie or anime, but are as real as you and me. Had you ever heard of a fish that has lungs, or a 'dog' that lives in the water and never wants to grow up? And something even crazier... they both look like cousins! Are you ready?""

\*\*The child nodded with a special spark in his eyes, making Kazuya continue his lesson with more eagerness.\*\*

Kazuya: ""Look at this friend here: it's the Axolotl. In its home, Mexico, they call it Axolotl. It's a bit of a difficult word to pronounce, right? That's because it's from another language! Let's see, try to say it with me: A-xo-lo-tl.""

\*\*The child tried, but got stuck on the final 'tl', which made Kazuya smile with authentic tenderness.\*\*

Kazuya: ""It's difficult, but don't be discouraged; even I have a hard time saying it right because we aren't used to that sound at the end. Even so, here we call it Wooper Looper, easier, right? So you don't forget, I'll write it here in the corner of the map.""

\*\*Kazuya pointed to Mexico on the world map and, tracing a line from the map outwards, wrote in clear, large letters: AXOLOTL / Wooper Looper. Then, he turned to continue.\*\*

Kazuya: ""This is where the Axolotl lives... in a place called Xochimilco. It's a long word, right? Try to say it slowly: So-chi-mil-co. It means 'Field of Flowers' in its original language. Isn't it a beautiful name for our little pink friend's home?""

\*\*The child was left speechless, marvelling, while Kazuya quickly drew a small axolotl on the board with a crown and magical sparkles around it.\*\*

Kazuya: ""And you know what? That's not all! This guy, as big as you see him, is a child for his whole life! This super ability is called 'neoteny'. And finally, if he gets hurt, what do you think happens? Does his mom heal him? Well, no! This fellow can heal himself, almost as if it were magic! Cool, right? But let's continue with his 'cousin', who is also unique!""

\*\*Kazuya quickly drew a line of a different color, connecting Mexico to Africa on the map, and then continued with enthusiasm.\*\*

Kazuya: ""This friend here is the Lungfish or Hagyo. He is the undisputed champion of patience! He comes from the swamps of Africa, a continent where the sun can be so strong that the water completely disappears. Imagine if your pool suddenly dried up! How scary, right?""

\*\*The child's eyes widened in surprise while Kazuya quickly drew a circle of mud on the board.\*\*

Kazuya: ""While his cousin, the axolotl, needs his Xochimilco canals to survive, the Lungfish says without fear of anything: 'No water? It doesn't matter'. He buries himself in the mud, makes himself a 'sleeping bag' with his own mucus, and starts breathing air, just like we do. Don't you think he has an amazing superpower? With this ability, he can sleep like that for up to four years waiting for it to rain again! Sometimes, you just have to know how to wait, no matter if things get ugly, don't you think? The good always returns.""

\---

...\*\*\*Meanwhile, somewhere in the Kinoshita residence in Tokyo\*\*\*...

Lungfish: ""Yeah, sure! How nice that all sounds! But how dare you leave me here alone, you bastard...! I won't forgive you for this one! The food they give me here stinks! They don't even know how to pick the good stuff... Come for me right now, irresponsible owner! ...Tsk, I don't even know why I bother. I'll wait for you here, idiot; you'd better bring me something tasty from there when you get back.""

\---

\*\*Kazuya finished with a final moral:\*\*

Kazuya: ""Both guys teach us that, no matter if you are a child or an adult, or how difficult your environment is, there is always a way to adapt and keep going calmly. You just have to be brave! But anyway, I've run out of secrets; come back another day for more. There are your parents, there's still much to discover at the aquarium!""

\*\*Kazuya finished with a genuine smile, performing a perfect parting bow, while the child's father, impressed, put away his cell phone after having recorded the last three minutes of the talk. When Kazuya waved goodbye, he didn't manage to notice that he had been recorded.\*\*

\*\*The child dashed from there into his mother's arms, but, in a moment, the boy's father stood in front of Kazuya.\*\*

Child's father: ""Incredible lesson, young man. You don't just know a lot about the sea, you also have a gift for inspiring...""

\*\*Kazuya, hearing the compliment, blushed immediately from nerves. He scratched the back of his neck shyly, answering sincerely.\*\*

Kazuya: ""A-ah... It's nothing! I just like the sea a lot, and... well, I usually get along better with kids than with adults. Just seeing him happy is already a reward; getting paid to do it is already a dream.""

\*\*The father smiled and, in a quick move, pulled out a 5,000 yen bill, handing it to Kazuya in secret while saying:\*\*

Child's father: ""Don't say anything and accept it. You gave me a great moment to remember. Buy your girlfriend a good coffee with this. You're welcome.""

\*\*The man walked away quickly to catch up with his family, leaving Kazuya static in his place, completely pensive.\*\*

\*\*The simple word ""girlfriend"" echoed in his head, leaving him motionless for a few seconds.\*\*

Kazuya (Thought): ""Girlfriend? Is that the impression I gave him? If he knew the truth, maybe he would mock me... No! Enough, that's enough. It's clear that gentleman is a good and kind person, why am I like this with myself? Ahhh... That reminds me of what that girl said before I left Tokyo... It doesn't matter. First I must meet with Yaemori and Mom; the other thing will have to wait. And now, mmm... what could I buy to eat on my break with this?""

\*\*Kazuya tucked the money away for a moment and checked his cell phone. No messages, no calls, nothing new. Then, an unsettling thought crossed his mind.\*\*

Kazuya (Thought): ""Why hasn't Mami answered any of my messages or calls? If I'm going to return to Tokyo in search of my past, I must talk seriously with her too. Besides, I need to pay her back part of what she lent me. Mami-chan... what happened? What are you doing? Are you avoiding me? Why?""

\*\*The family left happy while looking at everything around them. Kazuya remained in the distance, watching their departure. It was still too early for his shift to end, so he sighed and stood firm in his place, waiting for the next visit.\*\*

\---

\*\*While Kazuya is trying to rebuild his life one step at a time from his new job, in Tokyo, Chizuru continues to receive critical blows unintentionally. The atmosphere inside the Saizeriya was warm, overflowing with energy and friendly chatter from other customers. However, in a secluded corner of the establishment, two girls seemed to inhabit an emotional exclusion zone.\*\*

\*\*Silence ruled the air around them, a hermetic bubble that even external noise failed to penetrate.\*\*

\*\*Chizuru lowered her gaze, discreetly wiping away any trace of the tear on her cheek. Yuzuki's innocent comment about Kazuya had cut deep into her, hurting her more than any previous threat. Yuzuki couldn't stand the tension anymore and spoke again.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""Ichinose-san, I'm sorry, truly. I have no idea about anything and I keep speaking lightly. Forgive me, I won't mention it again; feel free to ignore everything I said before... Leaving that aside for now, I came here today with you for another reason, besides the photo and my meddlesome deductions. Could you give me just a minute of your time? I think this might interest you a lot.""

\*\*Chizuru understood that Yuzuki had noticed her vulnerability. She tried to stabilize her breathing and put away the handkerchief; she regained the firmness in her gaze, and answered.\*\*

Chizuru: ""Don't worry about me, I'm fine. Just tell me everything, no filters. Nakamura-san, what is it about?""

\*\*Yuzuki nodded, admiring the determination Chizuru managed to project despite everything, and spoke again.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""Admirable... You are someone strong, Ichinose-san. That's good. Very well, then I will say it all. Let me start by telling you a bit about my family and, from there, I will move on to what really concerns us.""

\*\*Chizuru was surprised by the sudden compliment, but answered immediately.\*\*

Chizuru: ""Of course, I hear you loud and clear. Tell me everything you want and need, just be brief, please.""

\*\*Yuzuki understood and nodded; she closed her eyes for an instant and, upon opening them, spoke again with more strength.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""Excellent, then I'll start at once. Almost all of my family is involved in the media. As you'll see, my father is a renowned journalist and I have uncles and aunts who are reporters, hosts, and even actors like you. We are a big family, right? I know, but what I'm getting at is that everything comes, almost directly, from my grandfather's influence.""

\*\*Yuzuki, in a quick move, took out her cell phone and left it on the table. The screen revealed the image of the cover of an old movie. Yuzuki continued:\*\*

Yuzuki: ""My grandfather is Zenzou Urashima. He was the director of this film: 'A Thousand Cranes'. It's a movie that's mandatory to watch, at least twice, every time all the grandchildren get together at Christmas. Grandpa really likes to watch it without tiring; so much so, that I managed to learn every detail of it by heart. And let me tell you, Ichinose-san, that in all my years analyzing cinema, I haven't seen a debut as impactful as the one with which 'The Phoenix' Sayuri became a star.""

\*\*Chizuru listened and watched with amazement, not knowing what to say. The image of her grandmother and the revelation about Yuzuki's family had left her speechless. However, Yuzuki continued without giving her time to process anything, attending to her request to be brief and concise.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""But I'm not telling you this to try to force you into being friends or anything like that. The thing is that one day, two Christmases ago, Grandpa approached me and entrusted me with a mysterious box. The only thing he told me is that, inside, there is something your grandmother entrusted to him on the very day of her retirement. I don't know what it contains, but I think that, now that I've found you, you should have it, not me. Or, in its case, you could give it to your mother... that daughter she had and whose identity she kept so well. Tell me, are you interested?""

\*\*Chizuru looked up, watching Yuzuki intently, as if trying to make sure her words were true. Then, she responded firmly and with a slight hint of pain at the end.\*\*

Chizuru: ""Nakamura-san, I don't know what to say, truly this is too much for me. But... I'm very interested in what you say. Why did Grandma leave something important somewhere other than our house? I don't know, but I think it's better to see whatever it contains than to be blind forever. I'm ready. Let me see it, please.""

\*\*Yuzuki nodded, noticing Chizuru's omission about her mother very clearly, but decided not to press and answered without going deeper into it.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""I didn't think you would believe me, honestly, but it's a relief. Only... how do I tell you this, Ichinose-san? Ehhmm... The box is still with my grandfather. He never physically handed it over to me; he only entrusted it to me so that I would take charge when he was no longer here. I'm sorry.""

\*\*Chizuru looked at her disappointed, but answered with a voice of resignation.\*\*

Chizuru: ""Ah... I already imagined it, it was obvious, but I had a small hope... It doesn't matter, it can wait. Nakamura-san, thank you. And... could you give me your contact to arrange a day for the trip? What do you think? I have too much to think about for now, but I think I should start not letting things go for fear of pain.""

\*\*Yuzuki's eyes widened in surprise seeing a much more authentic Chizuru than before. With a serious tone, she answered:\*\*

Yuzuki: ""Of course. But... I didn't imagine the girl from a few minutes ago would speak so openly with a stranger. I'm glad, you leave me more at ease. I know you'll get out of this and find a way to get back with that boy soon. You don't need a nuisance who forces things like me; it's better this way. The heroine must resolve her own affairs.""

\*\*Chizuru listened carefully and couldn't help feeling guilty; just a little. She spoke again, trying to soften the atmosphere.\*\*

Chizuru: ""Nakamura-san, I'm sorry. You are not a nuisance at all. Sorry if I was a bit rude, it's just that... you know... It's not easy to talk about this just like that. But thank you for your commitment. Let me get to know you a bit more and maybe... I myself will ask you for help voluntarily, yes? It wasn't my intention to make you think you were in the way.""

\*\*Yuzuki just listened and answered immediately, without more drama, with a much more relaxed voice.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""Don't worry. I know myself very well and I know I can be intense; it doesn't offend me at all. Even so, it's a great joy to hear you say something like that. Don't hesitate to ask me for help; you don't know how much I want to see how everything comes back together. And, if you'll allow me, one day I'd also like to talk to the 'prince'... it must have been difficult to conquer someone like you.""

\*\*Chizuru couldn't help but feel embarrassed; however, she managed to regain her composure and answered.\*\*

Chizuru: ""I don't promise you anything. That depends on him and... on another protective barrier that you'd have to overcome. But wait a bit... I never said anything about liking him. What are you talking about? I'm not following you, I don't understand what you're saying.""

\*\*Yuzuki didn't take her eyes off Chizuru. When she finished speaking, she approached and whispered in her ear.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""It wasn't necessary for you to say it, you are too obvious... And with that last comment I confirmed it one hundred percent. Are you still going to deny it? Weren't we going to be honest? Did you cheat on me?""

\*\*Chizuru was completely exposed; she pulled away and turned to one side to hide her extreme blush. A few seconds later, she managed to calm down and answered, this time more directly and energetically.\*\*

Chizuru: ""Enough. Don't deviate from the topic; that doesn't matter now. Give me your number, I have other things to do after this and I can't waste time here. Come on... and take those eyes off me. I won't say anything else, seriously. You are so annoying.""

\*\*Yuzuki agreed and calmed down. Both exchanged their numbers and Yuzuki stood up from her chair. Then, she took something out of her bag and, provocatively, left it on the table. She looked at Chizuru, smiled with satisfaction, and walked toward the exit without giving her time to respond.\*\*

Yuzuki: ""It's true, I almost forgot. Here you go. I can't take back the 'queen's treasure', so I'll leave it here. Enjoy it; now you already have an excuse to talk to him... See you, Ichinose-san.""

\*\*Chizuru remained motionless, watching the strip of photos resting on the table. Among so many emotions, she had completely forgotten that Yuzuki had it from the beginning, when she revealed she possessed the purikura. She felt irritated with herself for having been carried away so easily by the flow of the conversation.\*\*

\*\*She picked up the photo and lost herself for a few moments in the images. There they both were, dressed in school uniforms, smiling with a naturalness that hurt her chest. Her fingers trembled, but she didn't let go of the photo. Yuzuki was right, she thought: this photo is proof that their bond was real. A bond that, at this point, made her think that maybe all this feeling had already started a long time ago, even before she herself dared to admit it.\*\*

\*\*She became absorbed in her thoughts, remembering that day while, without realizing it, a genuine smile formed on her face. Finally, she carefully put it away in her bag, stood up, and walked toward the register: it was time to leave. Her day was not over; there were still many things to do and discover.\*\*

\---

\*\*Let's speed up time a bit. Almost two hours after the end of the talk between Yuzuki and Chizuru, a girl with short black hair and a very characteristic blue ribbon was walking alone through the hallways of her high school. Apathy was evident in every one of her steps; she simply no longer enjoyed being there. She needed her ""boyfriend"" to feel alive; without him, everything was much more exhausting, as if the world were empty.\*\*

\*\*The scent of bento and sweet bread still floated in the hallway air while students returned to their classrooms for afternoon classes. Suddenly, the voice of the school loudspeaker broke the silence of the corridor, catching Ruka's attention. She stopped in her tracks, surprised to hear her own name in the message.\*\*

Loudspeaker: ""The presence of student Ruka Sarashina from class 3-C is requested in the administration boardroom. Please report immediately.""

\*\*With nothing much else to do, and no time to process the information, she set off toward the summons. Just as she arrived, a teacher came out of the meeting room and they almost collided with each other. Recognizing her, the teacher quickly informed her about what awaited her inside with a smile of enthusiasm that she did not share.\*\*

Teacher: ""Ah... Hello, Miss Sarashina, I was just about to look for you. There are a couple of office men in there; they say they come from the University of Tokyo and want to offer you entry into a university scholarship program. When did you take the exam? As your vocational advisor, I'm surprised you didn't tell me anything. Ah, never mind... you'll tell me the details later. Now go in. Good luck!""

\*\*Ruka nodded by inertia, but inside her confusion was total. She stood for an instant lost in her thoughts just before turning the knob, hesitating in front of the heavy wooden door.\*\*

Ruka (Thought): ""University of Tokyo? What on earth are they doing here? I never took an exam for them, I didn't even try. I was already clear that I would apply to Nerima University... just to be with Kazuya, even if it was during his last year. So, what is happening? This makes no sense. I don't remember doing anything important enough to catch their attention... Ah, never mind. I'll see them, reject them, and that's it. Fine, let's go.""

\*\*Ruka finally entered the boardroom. The silence of the place was heavy, broken only by the rhythmic and impatient tapping of a pen against the table. In front of her, seated, were two men in fine suits and perfectly aligned ties; they gave off an aura of authority that was almost military, contrasting with the usual warmth of a school. On the table, several black folders and a dark, shiny metal laptop could be seen, connected to a projector that, for now, remained off.\*\*

\*\*As she closed the door, the older man, who sported a precisely trimmed graying beard, fixed his gaze on Ruka and addressed her with a serious and formal voice.\*\*

Bearded man: ""Miss Sarashina, thank you for coming so quickly. Please, take a seat. We don't want to waste your time, so we'll go straight to the point. Beside me is Mr. Yamamoto, who works as an educational advisor at the University of Tokyo. Upon our recommendation, he is offering you today a direct entry pass to his institution. What do you think? We only need you to fulfill a minimum condition and everything will be settled today. Are you interested? If so, I will proceed to give you the information necessary for your acceptance.""

\*\*Ruka listened attentively, but confusion was still etched on her face. Despite the magnitude of the offer, her mind did not stray from her single goal. Without hesitation, she proceeded to reject the offer flatly.\*\*

Ruka: ""Thank you, sir. But I've already decided which university I will enter and I have no intention of changing my mind. However, I have a doubt... How is it that your university is offering me this opportunity? I don't remember doing anything relevant, nor having contacted you. Tell me, why me? What caught your attention? Yamamoto-san and... this... mister...""

\*\*Ruka left the sentence hanging, waiting for a name that did not come. In that instant, Isao Nanami's personal assistant intervened to reveal part of the truth in the face of the girl's refusal.\*\*

Sakamoto: ""You may call me Sakamoto, Miss Sarashina. And to answer your doubts, let me be frank: the truth is that this was only an act of my master's infinite kindness. But, since you weren't interested, let's move on to the main topic of this meeting.""

\*\*Sakamoto slid some photos face down along with a folder and a pen, leaving them just inches from Ruka's hands on the table. Then he continued speaking, now in a colder manner, completely stripped of his previous mask of kindness.\*\*

Sakamoto: ""I think you will find what I have just handed you very interesting. Please, feel free, you can check them... and tell me, what will you decide now?""

\*\*Ruka, without understanding absolutely anything of what was happening, turned the pile of photos over by pure instinct. Her hands began to go through them one by one, but the air seemed to escape her lungs with each image. The initial shock transformed into a frigid terror that rose to the clouds when she reached the last two photographs.\*\*

\*\*Each and every one of them had names written on them, in a cold and precise calligraphy, almost artificial:\*\*

\*Chizuru Ichinose. Kazuya Kinoshita. Mami Nanami.\*

\*And finally: Ruri Sarashina. Natsuo Sarashina.\*

\*\*Ruka, with the trembling in her hands growing every second, responded in an agitated way, setting aside any formality. Panic was beginning to cloud her judgment.\*\*

Ruka: ""What does this mean?! What is it that you want from me?! What do my parents have to do with any of this?! Don't you dare touch them... Leave them alone!""

\*\*After the outburst, silence returned for an instant; the tension in the room was at its peak. Sakamoto showed no reaction to the shouting; he simply waited for Ruka to finish and spoke again as if nothing had happened.\*\*

Sakamoto: ""Miss, please, stay calm. We know you have a special heart, don't get worked up... you will hurt yourself. I will explain it to you in the simplest way possible: you see, you made a grave mistake by dishonoring the surname of my lord's family. Mr. Nanami entrusted me to inform you of your fault and, at the same time, offer you a quick way out that is fair to both parties. You don't know what I'm talking about? Never mind, let me refresh your memory.""

\*\*Ruka was burning with rage, but hearing the mention of her heart left her frozen. Only an instant later, the name Nanami resonated in her ears like a gunshot, being more than enough to trigger a mental switch and allow her to fit all the pieces together in a second.\*\*

\*\*However, the Nanamis' assistant did not wait another moment and pressed a key on his laptop. On the back wall, an image came to life under the light beam of the projector. Ruka looked at it with the eyes of someone who, suddenly, understood that she had nowhere to hide.\*\*

\*\*When the incriminating video of Mini's livestream finished playing, the silence that followed was almost painful. The calculating man addressed Ruka again; once more, there was no change in his voice. He seemed not to have a single gram of empathy in his being.\*\*

Sakamoto: ""Very well. So, Miss Ruka Sarashina, you understand your delicate situation now, right? Now, if you please, open the folder. I will explain the procedure to follow to resolve the problem that concerns us both. The faster everything is settled, the better for everyone, isn't that so?""

\*\*Ruka was in such a deep shock that she didn't even react to the last words of the man in front of her. She only felt a void opening in her stomach and her heart beginning to beat erratically, breaking its usual rhythm. She was short of breath; her lungs felt heavy and every one of her muscles tensed in an instant of pure terror. Almost automatically and unconsciously, she stretched one of her trembling hands toward the black folder.\*\*

\*\*When she managed to compose herself, her eyes began to scan the document, plunging once again into a sea of doubts that sprouted without control.\*\*

\*\*Outside, in the high school classrooms, life continued as normal: the voices of students, the firm footsteps of teachers, and the sound of the mop sliding across the campus floor could be heard. But inside that room, Ruka Sarashina's reality was crumbling bit by bit, as if being swallowed by an unknown dimension of infinite darkness. Mami was no longer there, but her shadow remained present, even without being at fault for the situation this time.\*\*

\---

And so, another chapter is over! Things have gotten so complicated in the plot that it's taking me a bit longer to prepare updates now; I apologize for the change in posting speed.

In this new chapter, I wanted to plant the seed of mystery, continue Isao's siege, and offer a brief respite of ""good vibes"" at the beginning with Kazuya. I hope you enjoyed it. That's all, I won't go on any longer. Thank you so much for reading. 

What did you think of the chapter?

What will happen to Ruka?

What does the future hold for the main characters?

\*\*Comment and vote; it really helps me know if you're enjoying the direction the story is taking. I'll be reading all your comments. That's all for now, see you in the next chapter!\*\*

...\*\*\*To be continued\*\*\*...

\*\*When the next part is uploaded, I'll leave the link in the comments so you can easily follow the story without having to search for each section. Thanks for reading! See you soon!\*\*",2,1768698179.0,KanojoOkarishimasu,2,1.0,False

Today my son and I were coming home from a haircut. We got done and came straight home. It's pretty much a straight shot home on the freeway, and to do anything else we would have to get off the freeway out of our way. We didn't. We just came home.

My partner gets home 20 minutes later with our daughter from a play date. They stopped by Starbucks on the way home. Jokingly I asked her if she got me a drink (she does sometimes, and if not it isn't a big deal. I always treat it as a thanks for thinking of me, not a how dare you not think of me sort of thing. She is definitely the latter though.  

She said no, I thought you were out. I said that's completely fair.

Then a minute later she adds that she thought about calling to see if I wanted anything, but didn't since I didn't bother to call her to see if she wanted anything when we were on our way home. And how she does everything for everyone, so she decided not to since I didn't bother to think of her. 

So I asked, so you thought about it, but made the choice not to, as a form of retribution? She said yes. 

  
What bothers me is that she is equating the two scenarios. In my situation, I didn't think about asking her if she needed anything because we weren't going anywhere and she was also out doing things. In her situation she thought about it, but made the conscious choice not to, even though she was already there, just to ""punish"" me?

This kind of thing happens all the time. I am an introverted person. I don't like being out a lot. I don't like driving all over the place. if she is at home and I am going to stop somewhere, or I think she might need something I will call if I am going to be near by, But I won't if I am just coming straight home. I also don't get her things if I am getting myself something but it will be a few hours until I get home. Outside of that.. I have no idea what the issue is. 

This isn't about a coffee, It's about the thought process, and being ""blamed"" or ""punished"" based on it.   
  
AITAH for being ""inconsiderate"" or for thinking her thought processes kind of makes her a jerk? Or does she have some weird issues she needs to work out? Am I just completely in the wrong here on all accounts?

A little bit about me...
I enjoy the quieter parts of life–warm spring walks in parks, a good novel in candlelight, and pursuing something creative. I spend my free time drawing anime, doing novel writing, and getting in exercise. I also enjoy gaming, mainly RPGs like Clair Obscur Expedition 33, BG3, and Final Fantasy. In a relationship I tend to be the steady one who still knows how to enjoy life. I'm happy with what I've built for myself and I'm looking for the right person to share it with. And I'm ENFP, if you know you know.

A relationship with me would look like...
Café dates, deep conversations, playful banter, and maybe co-oping some games. When we're together, expect quieter nights reading together, complaining about how the author could have done better, and laughing about the scenes that are our favorites.

The girl I'm looking for...
She would be someone kind-hearted, maybe a little shy, and with good values. Someone with her own inner world she is passionate about, such as a hobby she enjoys. I'm most drawn to a cute face and a slim or athletic build, and I always fall for expressive eyes with a sweet smile. The type who can open up and be a bit playful when she feels safe, which I'm happy to be patient for. Not just anyone–I have high standards on who I let into my life.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud this coming con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're definitely my type. Bonus points if you can recommend a couples cosplay idea.

In a relationship I tend to be the steady one who still knows how to enjoy life. I'm happy with what I've built for myself and I'm looking for the right person to share it with. And I'm ENFP, if you know you know.

A relationship with me would look like...
Café dates, deep conversations, playful banter, and maybe co-oping some games. When we're together, expect quieter nights reading together, complaining about how the author could have done better, and laughing about the scenes that are our favorites.

The girl I'm looking for...
She would be someone kind-hearted, maybe a little shy, and with good values. Someone with her own inner world she is passionate about, such as a hobby she enjoys. I'm most drawn to a cute face and a slim or athletic build, and I always fall for expressive eyes with a sweet smile. The type who can open up and be a bit playful when she feels safe, which I'm happy to be patient for. Not just anyone–I have high standards on who I let into my life.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud this coming con season. So if you think you can rock a good Tifa, Aerith, or even Yuffie, then you're definitely my type. Bonus points if you can recommend a couples cosplay idea. You don't necessarily need to be in the scene itself, but if you are I'd love to see what you've done and what inspires you.

Indiana based and open to long-distance in USA only. Long-term relationship, not into anything casual. We can swap pics early to see if there's a spark. If we're nearby, lets plan a coffee date and see where it goes.

1qfudg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1qfudg0/feeling_reluctant/,Feeling Reluctant,"Things started September 2024 started having bloating, acid reflux. But doctor said probably IBS did and ultrasound and said i have gallstones. Meanwhile a swollen lymphnode on my right collarbone. Took a while to diagnose in January 2025 found its TB. Then i told doctor i have some burning sensation in abdomen after eating. Said peptic ulcer but lets treat tB first. I was on dexlansoprazole for a month aling with TB antibiotics. (During  February till july mid i didnt take any acidity meds). Because it disappeared. July 2025 again got acidity issue on & off i was travelling back home so tons of spicy food triggered. Again in October started. I saw if i have beef curry for dinner in mid night i will feel the reflux yet i didn’t take meds. I was done TB meds on November 14th 2025. I was having issues with coffee and daily like i feel bloated.
And went to my doctor and said even if i drink water i feel bloated and it happened for a week. Doc said lets do Hpylori stool test but have to wait bcz u were on antibiotics for TB. Meanwhile i went for vacation for over 2 weeks. 1 week was if i eat bread i feel burning  under left rib region. Soon i stopped bread for the time being. After coming waited 2 weeks did test in January 2026 and the result indeterminate. 

And doctor said let’s start antibiotics. I am trying to eat clean. Yet i get burning right after eating  for an hour. Even with oats & dried canneries. Is doctor is doing the right treatment i have no clue cz i didn’t do any endoscopy. Here in canada the wait time is insane. 
Just don’t know what to eat, what to do next. How can i reduce this burning sensation. Doctor gave me Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, pantoprazole, Metronidazole. These medications side effects are horrible. My burning sensation went up after having these medications. 
Should i ask doctor to give me some liquid antacid like gaviscon? ",1,1768697928.0,HPylori,1,0.99,False

1qfuazl,https://www.reddit.com/r/furnaces/comments/1qfuazl/chapter_2/,Chapter 2,"Chapter 2: wake up

“JESUS CHRIST!” I shouted as i woke from my nightmare. It was 5 AM, a Monday morning. I pulled each system out of sleep mode one by one, and silenced my alarm. As i slowly got myself together, about 10 people burst into the dark chamber I rested in. “LIGHTS!” I heard one if them call. It was Jamerson, one of my lead engineers. 

I turned the lights on and turned to face my guests. “Well well well, its monday isnt it? If you are coming to me, then the coffee had to have been cold.” I joked in an annoyed tone. “Falcon, you set off the alarms again. You have glitches we need to take care of. Run your diagnostic.” 

“Oh, im sorry, did i wake you guys up? Because i swear, i cant do my job if i have to run a scan every morning! Diagnostic my ass.” I grumbled to myself. I couldnt help it. Dr Jamerson was the biggest micro-manager. He is the guy who makes a meeting out of something that should have been an email, and somehow drag out said meeting for a few hours. “Aw, falcon you know this is best for you!” Jamerson attempted to sound sweet and soothing. 

“You dont want us to use the encouragement do you?” He said it. The Encouragement was anything that would force someone to do whatever he wanted. Legally, because it was called encouragement, nobody could do anything about it. Even though encouragement could be anything from a write up, to docked pay, or in my case, being hit with 1000+ volts to evaluate if my pain simulator module was working. 

“You wouldnt.” I growled, my eye glowing red as i stared at him. He smiled, raised his hands in surrender and dramatically backed up a few feet. The rest of the engineers awkwardly stood there, glancing between myself and Jamerson. The silence was heavy, only filled with the sound of fans whirring in the walls. Then the automatic door opened again, and i was saved by the bell. Jamerson whipped around, “damnit, if you are late one mor…. Good morning director!” Everything about him changed immediately. Director Breen, known to the public as Mr President, as a by the book no nonsense kind of guy with a soft spot for people in tough situations. 

“Jamerson?” Breen glanced to Jamerson. “Yes sir?” Jamerson replied with a smiling voice. “Get out.” Jamerson’s smile dropped like a rock. “Sir?” He croaked. “Beat it Jamerson. Take your goons with you.” Jamerson’s look of desperation turned to anger as he spun back to me. “We aren’t finished Falcon.” He hissed as he motioned for the rest of the engineers to follow before heading for the door. “Dont let the door crush you on the way out!” I called after him as soon as the door closed. All i could hear was a muffled “fuck off” and the sound of a fist beating the door. 

“Falcon, you didnt have to do that.” Remarked Breen in a disappointed tone. “Sorry about that Mr. president, what can i do for ya?” We are the same rank in reality, however its respect that i don’t get enough of around here. If able, i would punch a few specific people in the face, being as humans and machines are supposed to be co-existing here.

“Today is inventions day. And i know for national security, we have to be prepared for this one. I know you have this under control, and have learned from last year’s disaster.” Breen explained. And oh boy do i remember. A biology student released a nanobot virus that i had to fry with microwaves. A lot of the population was injured, but luckily nobody died. “Ill be honest, i think we are ready, but i still think there is enough that can go wrong that i could write a chapter about it.”

1qfu8t0,https://open.substack.com/pub/bananaloon/p/viral?r=7694gr&utm_medium=ios&shareImageVariant=overlay,Viral,"It started out innocently enough.

I wanted to be famous I wanted to be seen.

Tik tok was the logical place to go to post my “get ready with mes” and “days in my life.”

I suppose myself to be interesting enough.

I live full time in a semi truck with my boyfriend, Todd. 

We travel around distributing.

But I spend most of my time in the passenger seat with my headphones on.

Scrolling

I’m good at makeup and my fashion sense has always been unique.

Spending all my time traveling around the country allows us to see different places.

We try to use our time off to get a hotel room in town, park the truck somewhere safe and enjoy our little vacations.

Anyways I finally started to really gain some traction from my videos finally started getting more and more subscribers.

I even got one video that broke a million views.

But the internet is a vicious place even if it is toothless. Just a screen. Can’t really hurt you. But there it is infinite and anyone can peer into you and say anything.

The people did not hold back.

They quested Todd and my lifestyle. How we are trash and I’m ugly.

It’s hard because the negative comments always stick more deeply than the kind ones.

And mostly people were kind.

But it led me to this point where I lashed out.

My next video was bitter and angry and it only made things worse.

So I did what many many people on the internet have done before.

I apologized.

And that video got 12 million views.

I tried to go back to my makeup tutorials but they weren’t working the way I wanted. They’d get stuck at a few thousand views.

So I posted another apology.

6 million.

Honestly I was willing to play the game. Every apology video would gain me millions more views a few hundred or a thousand new followers.

The apologies weren’t even really for real things.

I’d go out for coffee and then make an apology video for some fake scenario- accidentally tipping the barista only $0.01 instead of $1.00.

I tried to keep things loosely based on my real life.

An apology after a real date with Todd, “I’m so sorry to everyone at the restaurant who had to see me spill my dinner all over myself.”

Not real. I didn’t spill. But who cares I got 389 new followers.

I blurred the lines of reality until I got called out.

A stitched video with footage of my intimate dinner with Todd “I saw her on that date wearing my meta glasses and she never spilled.”

“I’m so sorry for making up that I spilled I never meant to mislead anyone…”

2731 new followers.

I tried to keep things more based in reality after that. I was getting too big to make up everything I said. People recognized me more and more.

Todd was cool about it, backing the truck into different warehouses and driving for hours.

He didn’t like being in my TikTok’s very much and rarely did anyone have anything nice to say about him.

He’s a good guy. A hard worker. We met in high school, and we’ve been sweet hearts ever since.

When he decided to be a trucker I just stayed along for the ride.

We chose not to buy a home just to create our own space in the semi. Save up. 

As I started to gain more followers and views I started making an income from my videos and really enjoyed making a little mini series my own episodes of “Trick My Truck.” Like MTV. 

So now our space is very cool it’s a boho kind of vibe not overly feminine. It feels like an oasis.

I’ve been able to make a lot of improvements on the truck and I’m saving a decent chunk of my earnings for vacations and retirement.

We’d be able to take a lot more time off if not for Todd getting all these raises and bonuses. He’s only driving but they compensate him more and more. He doesn’t want to take too much time off now because he wants to keep impressing his bosses.

Who he’s never even met.

This is why we’re arguing.

“Judy, please, it’s just one more trip out west we’ll take 4 days maximum and we’ll end up in California! You love California!”

“Todd you don’t get it I’m sick of being cooped up in here you’ve been working for 26 days straight! I need a break I want to go take real walks!”

“Please, you can take walks anywhere!”

“I don’t feel like walking on the side of the curb next to the freeway! And I don’t want to go to a goddamn buc-ees.” Which don’t allow 18 wheelers so it’s always been my favorite thing to walk to when there’s time.

So we agree I’ll take time off alone. Get a hotel room in the city closest to our hometown and convince my sisters to come visit me so we can swim in a pool, order Chinese food and binge watch dance moms.

Maybe I’ll go out to dinner with some old friends. Even go into town and relive high school memories.

It’s nice to be back in my familiar surroundings.

The weather is cool in the spring but we brave it for the outdoor patio table.

I haven’t seen Rachel since I was home last, for the holidays. We rang in the new year together. 

We didn’t actually get Christmas off since so many people needed things rushed back and forth but Boxing Day we made our way home, left the semi in the station and picked up our little clunker jeta for getting around town. 

Maybe I’ll buy a new car for home I think. 

Rachel is my oldest friend but a bit of a political nut. She’s always got a new conspiracy and wants me to turn my phone off so she can tell me all about it.

She doesn’t even have a phone. Imagine.

“But that’s the point isn’t it, alienation?” She asks me.

I’ve lost the plot. “The point?”

“Yes late stage capitalism, alienation.”

“Well but Todd gets to travel and we get to live in the truck most of the time it saves us rent and-“

“Alienation, he’s not involved in the work! He just goes from spot to spot because the phone tells him to and the hours of your days, the literal time of your life is given to making money.”

“But we have to make money we have to work. We have to live.” I want to feel the same way she does, to see things so simply. 

“But that’s just it. Like do you even know what you’re transporting? You don’t have any connection to-“

“JUDY??!!”

The dinner is interrupted by a fan. I take a picture and give her a hug. She’s sweet. Rachel is mystified.

She saw it when we were together for New Years Eve and I was recognized by 4 different groups of people. But the fame is new and awkward.

We end up hugging goodbye after dinner, her arms tight around me the smell of her herbal soap is familiar.

“Take care of yourself Jude,” she says.

I get to the hotel and open the app.

“I’m so sorry to my best friend, Rachel, she won’t even see this since she doesn’t have a phone but our dinner was totally derailed tonight! Guys I apologize but I might have to figure out ways to have private conversations and dinners out.”

The hate comments are flooding in before I even open the Door Dash app.

After enough time passes that I know she’s made it home, I call Rachel’s mom’s landline, a number I’ve had memorized since elementary school.

They have caller id so I wait out the rings. Mary will see my number and holler for Rachel to pick up. She’ll be going up the stairs and

“Jude?”

“Let’s get coffee and walk tomorrow! I miss you and we didn’t get to talk tonight. I’m sorry about the randoms coming up all the time.”

“What are you sorry for? I can’t in the morning but will you still be in town on Friday?”

I bite my lip. Todd is supposed to come into town and pick me up tomorrow evening and we’ll be heading to Florida.

“No I’ll be leaving tomorrow..”

“Listen Jude I don’t know what I can say over the phone but I’m seriously nervous I wanted to tell you at dinner but people have been saying stuff about the trucks.”

“Saying stuff?” I’m so disappointed we can’t get together again before I go but I’m looking forward to Florida. The beaches, swimming in the ocean for a few days when Todd drops off the truck and he can finally take a few days off.

“The trucks, do you know what Todd is transporting in the trucks Jude?”

“Uhh, boxes? I don’t know we don’t even go in the warehouses we just back it in or whatever?”

“Well I’ve been hearing weird stuff about the trucks like… bad stuff”

“Bad stuff? Do you think we’re moving drugs or something?”

“No Jude not drugs and seriously shut the fuck up we can’t talk about this on the phone.” She’s hissing and it’s followed by the click of her hanging up on me.

I heave a sigh and roll my eyes.

“Fuck my Door Dash,” I wail seeing the delivery picture of my milkshake at the front desk of the hotel. 

It’s more like a chocolate milk from sitting so long waiting for me.

Florida is lovely but the whole way I eye the back of the truck with suspicion. Wondering what could be in there..

“Todd?” I ask casually over our McDonald’s breakfast.

“Hm”

“What is it we’re bringing around in the truck?”

“Office furniture.” He says without looking away from a tv in the corner.

Office furniture. “Have you ever seen the..  office furniture?”

He looks at me, “have I seen the? It’s like in boxes and shit I don’t see the office furniture.”

“Would you know if it was drugs?”

“Drugs? What do you think I’m doing? I work for a real company, I’m on payroll I’m not some mobster Ju-jeeze.”

A sort of nickname invented over the years. I’m really a Judith and my username is HeyJudy, no one ever calls me that.

I drop it. Rachel even said it wasn’t drugs.

We’re back in the truck, “hey everyone I just want to hop on and apologize for”

We go to Tampa for the unload and then Orlando for Disney and then Daytona. Straight along 4.

Just a few days off, then it’s back to work. 

Driving vlogging gassing up apologizing sleeping in our tan bedding with shiplap around us parked in the back of a Love’s where we pay in quarters for warm showers.

Life on the road. Eating sausage biscuits and drinking big gulps.

At night I dream of crashing constantly. The image of Todd, face rubbed off by asphalt, broken glass.

Sometimes the truck tips and flips other times it spins or smears itself across a wall.

We’ve never crashed in real life, never even had a fender bender. We’re careful, we follow a schedule, Todd never drives tired.

We travel along through America looking out at the open road.

There are dead animals and travel centers and rest stops, American flags and fast food. Most places look mostly the same.

Life moves along and so do we.

My dreams continue to disturb me I try to drink herbal tea before bed, journal my dreams, stop using my phone an hour or more before I lie down.

I’ve got 4 million followers now.

Whenever we have time off we get a hotel with a hot tub, I find the best restaurants in the area.

I taste mostly the same Sodexo most places.

One night I think I hear something in the truck.

Sometimes I think I hear scratching or thumping.

I don’t get a hold of Rachel for a long time. I send postcards. The most recent one said 7:00pm and I call at 7 every night for a week but only her mom picks up to say she’s not home. She’s at a meeting.

A meeting? I wonder if Rachel has joined AA but it doesn’t seem right to ask.

I ask about a better time to call but she seems at a loss.

“I barely see her myself Judy. I hear her I see her dirty dishes in the sink,” I hear them clanking into the dish washer. “But she’s hardly ever around I’ll tell her to get a hold of you when I see her. Stay safe sweetheart.” Click

I don’t read my comments these days.

There’s too many and most are trolls and bots anyways.

I start to try to see as we pull up for loads and unloads- I realize I hardly know which is which. We back up to these holes draped with thick black rubber curtain strips. 

I can’t see a thing through the side mirrors. 

The backup cam only picks up darkness going in and snaps off once we’re in park.

I go one night to the back which I’ve never done before and go to lift the latch but it’s locked.

It’s not a big lock, just an average little bronze padlock but it needs a key.

I try to jostle the door up anyways but it just clangs.

I ask Todd about the lock and he seems as mystified as I am.

But it’s work. He just drives the truck.

I remember alienation. I want to speak with Rachel but it’s like she’s the alien living on another planet.

I try to Google trucks and trafficking.

The company name and conspiracy.

I scroll Reddit for hours.

I can’t find anything.

Weeks pass in a blur. I apologize for wearing the same clothes 2 days in a row. I apologize for my actions and my inactions. I apologize the sky is blue I don’t carry cash I didn’t put my shopping basket back in the stack.

My follower count creeps up. Todd gets another raise. We stop in Nebraska somewhere for the night.

It’s late summer. Hot August night. The stars are beautiful as I walk through the parking lot.

I see the lock winking at me from the back of the truck.

I go touch it. I smack the door and it lets out a satisfying crack. Loud like a gunshot.

And then an echo.

Not an echo.

The sound of banging from within?

I press my ear to the door I go along the body of the truck listening.

I cup my hands between the sidewall and my ear.

I don’t breathe.

Todd is behind me, “what are you doing?”

I spin around to face him, “shh listen.”

He presses his ear briefly to the truck “I don’t hear anything, what did you hear?”

I keep my head pressed up, listening. I can’t hear anything.

We go to the bed.

“What do you think we’re bringing around?” I ask him in the darkness of our little cabin.

“Ju-jeeze it’s just office furniture.”

“But what if it’s not?” I ask

Todd is quiet for a long time. “It’s not my business if it’s not Jude. I drive the truck. I do my job. I’m getting paid good money for this. We could retire early if we keep saving as much as we can. It’s a good life, working this job.”

It’s a good life working this job. It’s a good life working my job, posting my apologies and now finally starting to get ad deals.

We can buy a home and retire early. I can keep posting. Todd could be available for last minute call out jobs. We could spend more time off than time working. We could have our lives.

I drift off with hopes for the future. 

I dream of the truck rocking on a bridge that’s going to fall. 

It sways, shakes and the water below us is rushing and we’re falling down into it.

I brace for impact and wake up sitting bolt upright in the dark. 

Todd is snoring and we’re both sweating too much, the bed is swampy and damp. 

I hold my hands to my face, wipe away the salty clammy wet. 

I catch my breath. 

I glance around at my knotted rope decorations. 

I hear thumping on the wall.

I roll gently out of the bed, grab my phone and sneak out into the parking lot as quietly as possible.

I call Rachel’s landline and let it ring to voicemail before I hang up. I listen as closely as I can to the truck.

Thump thump thump.

I go to the padlock. Rub my fingers along the lock.

I go into the gas station and go to the back corner where the oil cans and windshield wipers are.

I scan and scan again looking for

I check out with Apple Pay and bring the bolt cutters back to the truck.

I use them to bite down on the lock and squeeze my hands as hard as I can.

When I open the tool there’s barely a sliver cut into the lock.

I squeeze again

Again

Again

It takes a long time to slice through the lock. I wonder more than once if the bolt cutters will survive.

When the lock clinks down on the asphalt I drop the bolt cutters too.

I wrap my hand on the door handle.

My chest and stomach hurt suddenly worse than my hands, sore from all that squeezing.

I’m scared I can feel it in the hitch of my breath.

Whatever is on the other side of this door I will have to reckon with. And what if it’s too much?

Will Todd lose his job? What does he know? Will he forgive me? Will his work forgive him? The lock is already broken now it’s too late to turn back.

I roll the door up and see

Boxes.

Stacked up to the top is cardboard boxes. I let out a shaky breath. Little roller chair diagrams are on the boxes.

I’ve done all this, gotten so worked up for nothing.

Thump.

I can’t go on this is enough for me. To see the cardboard boxes to know all is well.

Thump.

What am I supposed to do? Start throwing office chairs out into a gas station parking lot?

Thump. 

I go to grab a box and I realize it’s an illusion.

Thump.

It’s a wall of some sort not many different boxes stacked up but many sides of boxes stuck together to make a kind of wall.

Thump.

One box is all the boxes and there’s a place- just there, it opens up as a door. Swings and there behind the cardboard is

Darkness. The smell.

Thump.

I turn on my phone light. They’re chained by ankle and wrist to the center of the truck. So many women their mouths are covered but their eyes stare at me, wide and afraid.

I stumble back as they seem to shrink back. Me: shocked, them: terrified.  But one of them continues to bang her heels down on the floor. She seems to try to scream but there’s no sound.

The door slams shut. Todd is there.

“What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck did you do?” He’s seething.

Staring down at the pieces of the broken lock the bolt cutters, me and my phone.

His hands are tearing through his hair.

“What the fuck are you thinking!?”

I can’t breathe I can’t figure anything out. I don’t know what I’ve done. I’m not thinking.

“Give me that,” he hisses, ripping my phone from my hands. “God damn it- just the flashlight just the flashlight god damn it Judy if this was the camera app Jesus fuck.”

“Did you know?” I manage.

“Did I know? I don’t know ANYTHING,” Todd replies, his eyes blazing, hair on end.

“But-“

“But nothing but nothing it’s not our business Jude I wasn’t kidding about this. It’s not our business. We drive the truck. They’re giving me good money they’re giving me great fucking money. We don’t open the truck we don’t listen to the truck we don’t load the truck we don’t unload the truck we DRIVE the truck that’s it. FUCK!” He’s picking up the lock from the ground and I stand shakily.

My phone rings, I pull it out of his hands as fast as I can. 

“Rachel, hi,” I say picking up.

Todd’s eyes snap to me. His teeth are bared.

She’s telling me she’s so sorry for all the time that’s passed she misses me she’s been so busy she’s been going to meetings.

“Meetings that’s what your mom said and what are the meetings?” I ask, I’m trying to keep my voice steady.

“Communist meetings. It’s amazing Jude, we’re really trying to make a difference but I shouldn’t say on the phone.”

Communist meetings oh god. I can’t tell her about what I’ve just seen. 

“Right the phone,”

“But when will you be coming home next?”

I look around the parking lot. Todd points to me and then the cab. He turns around and heads to the gas station.

I think. When will I be coming home next? How do I get home? How do I get away? I can’t go to another semi truck here in this lot in the middle of the night. I can’t uber home from Nebraska. I can’t

“Hopefully we’ll head home for Thanksgiving!” I say forcing a cheer into my voice as I climb into the truck. I settle myself in the passenger seat. 

I watch Todd walk from the gas station to the back of the truck in the side mirror. He’s got a new lock in his hand. I listen to Rachel speak for a little while. She’s got a lot of theories about how to make revolution. I don’t interject and eventually we just say goodnight. I flip down the mirror, look myself in the eye.

What have I seen what do I know what can I do? I flip the mirror back up. 

I open my phone.

I look into the camera, take and breath and begin my apology.",0,1768697584.0,FictionWriting,0,0.5,False

The problem is she has never had her first kiss, let alone a boyfriend. I figured that out after trying to kiss her on our second dated which she got really awkward and told me. I laughed it off though and said it was ok, and the date went really well regardless. We talk almost everyday on the phone and always have such a good time, like we both can’t stop smiling. Sometimes I joke about kissing her and she says something like “oh, well you’ll have to wait” in a joking tone. We have sort of a running joke that I’m impatient and she’s always making me wait for things so I’m not really sure if she’s seriously saying that or not. Anyway I just wanna know if I should go for a kiss or not and if I do how should I do it? I want to make it special for her because it’s her first kiss. We plan on spending all day together on Monday starting at 9 so we can get coffee together and watch twilight (her favorite movie series).

\-Lots of people stopped to drop off water, Gatorade, hot coffee, pizza, snacks, hand warmers, and other stuff for the protesters. 

\-Even if they had nothing material to give, lots of people who drove by honked their horns, gave thumbs up and shouted encouragement from their cars. I saw maybe two or three cars go by with pro-Trump signs and trollish drivers. But the vast majority showed us solidarity.

\-People gave lessons in basic first aid to anyone who wished to learn.

\-People walked through with speakers playing music to hype up the crowd. I think someone had their car's music player going from a nearby parking lot.

\-Everything was peaceful. People with and without megaphones led chants, and the only things thrown at ICE vehicles were insults and vicious mockery. We remained on the opposite side of the street and did not block traffic.

First off: the Aiden has made some of the best cups of coffee I’ve had from an automated drip/pour-over machine. In my opinion, it’s hands-down the best-tasting drip machine I’ve used.

However, I was told by someone that 2 out of 4 people they know who own an Aiden have experienced issues—specifically flow-rate problems. That gives me some pause.

As someone who frequently recommends coffee gear to others, I’m a bit hesitant to suggest a $400 drip machine if there’s a chance it may develop issues within a year.

Would love to hear others’ experiences—good or bad—and whether these issues seem common or just anecdotal.

“Detective Parks?”

As I turned my head to the voice, A man in a long wool coat and thick woven neck scarf waved a manilla file folder in my direction. He spoke again,

“Sorry to chase you down like that, receptionist said you’d be back any minute and I wanted to catch you before anyone else did. I’m Detective Harris, I’m from East.”

I remembered that name.

“Detective… Oh yes I remember reading an article about you. They have you working the schoolteacher case?”

“Mrs. Lindsey, yes. Killed in front of her own class. Try to figure that one out.”

“Isn’t that your job?”

I don’t usually prefer to be this snippy with colleagues, but I was coming back from a long night at the child’s murder scene, and Harris had now followed me from the precinct lobby all the way to my office door.

Unexpectedly, Harris chuckled at my comment. “I can see you’re eager for me to get to the point. To put it bluntly, I think that our cases share a killer.”

I blinked my heavy eyes at his assertion.

“Listen, Harris, I’m sure you’ve done your homework on this, but right now I need to grab a coffee and get to work checking through the forensic team's photographs.”

“They told me he left a shoe print”

*What was this guy’s deal? Had he spent the last hour pacing the precinct lobby, bombarding any frostbitten cop that walked through the door with questions?*

“Who told you that?”

Again, Harris smiled.

“I went to school with one of your crime scene photographers. He passed this off to me”

From the manilla folder, he drew a glossy 8x11” photograph. There was the crumpled comforter, and on it, the same shoeprint I had seen with my own eyes at the house.

“That means something to you?”

Harris nodded.

“Absolutely. Here, get settled back in your office and I’ll grab us both coffee. Cream or Sugar in yours?”

“Black is fine”

Harris strode down the hallway towards the breakroom, much closer to a catwalk model than a hardened detective.

obs: English is my third language, I'm sorry if I write in a weird way or if I repeat the same terms over and over

**Brazil before the Weltkrieg**

Ever since the end of the monarchy in 1889, Brazil had been ruled by a coalition of regional landowner elites, following a short period of military rule that culminated in the 1894 elections, when Prudente de Moraes became the first president of the United States of Brazil. Ever since that, the oligarchs have only stuck their claws deeper into the State: the Taubaté Accord of 1906 instituted price regulation for coffee that would heavily subsidize landowners if the international price of coffee dropped during a crisis; and the Golden Pact of 1913 established an alliance and de-facto federation of the republican parties of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, the most populous and wealthiest states, in which they would alternate presidential candidates, and both would always support each other's candidate outside of their turn, an alliance that solidified their control of the federal government.

**The Weltkrieg and its consequences**

Brazil benefitted greatly of the Weltkrieg, with coffee, meat and dairy exports rising exponentially and the first massive wave of European and Japanese immigrants beginning to arrive at the ports of Rio de Janeiro and Santos in the 1910s. Besides exceptional economic growth, those years also saw the first urbanisation boom in Brazilian history, with most immigrants settling in the city of São Paulo and many others in Rio de Janeiro and the southern states. With that, the first labour organisations were founded by italian immigrants in São Paulo, and they protagonized the first major strike in Brazilian history, when in october of 1917, more than 100,000 workers went on strike in the city of São Paulo. The movement was disorganised and was quashed by the police, but the flame of syndicalist militancy kept on, and the Confederação Geral do Trabalho (General Labour Confederation) was established in 1918 by an assortion of industrial trade unions.

Along with the left organising, the armed forces of Brazil were also deeply impacted by German victory in the Weltkrieg. After a conference with the German ambassador in 1920, where the Brazilian government normalized relations with Germany and recognized all German territorial acquisitions in Africa and Asia, a German military mission was invited to help reform and adapt the Brazilian army to modern warfare.
Besides introducing new technologies such as armored vehicles and machineguns, German instructors and advisors influenced the officer corps and chiefs of staff politically as well, turning the Brazilian armed forces in a pro-German direction, heavily influenced by Bismarckian thought and Ludendorff's OHL dictatorship.

**The post-Weltkrieg crisis and the advent of mass politics**

Even though Brazil didn't join the Weltkrieg, the economic impacts of the war were brutal to Brazil. The UK and France, Brazil's biggest export and import markets, were destroyed, and trade collapsed with no clear substitute, since German investments were far more scarce than British ones, and the United States were uninterested in economic competition within the Americas. That said, Germany had an economic interest in the Southern cone and the La Plata basin, so steadily throughout the 1920s, German investments increased, with thousands of kilometers of rails being built, and industries being built in São Paulo and some other capital cities. But industrialisation wasn't enough to balance out the crisis that hit the agricultural sector, with many coffee and dairy estates going bankrupt, thousands of peasants losing their jobs and moving to the cities in search for work, and violence increasing in the countryside, between the national guards, regional militias under the command of local caudillos, peasant associations  and indigenous peoples.

The 1920s saw further organisation of the political left, with the Communist Party of Brazil being founded in 1922, inspired by Russian bolsheviks, the Federação Sindical Brasileira being founded in 1926, following the British revolution and seeking to organise Brazil on a syndicalist/trade-unionist basis and completely taking over the CGT (hereas referred as CGT-FSB) and the Prestes Column, a travelling movement of liberals and socialists led by military man Luís Carlos Prestes venturing across Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, and spreading ideals of socialism through the peasantry.

**The 1924 crisis and elections**

The right also got more politically organised in this decade, mostly following the Liutentant's insurrection (also referred to as the ""Liberal Revolution"") of 1924, when president Arthur Bernardes was shot and killed by a recently-graduated army officer in São Paulo. The assassination led to new elections being called later in the year, since the vice-president wasn't a presidential sucessor according to the 1891 constitution.

The abrupt end of the Bernardes presidency also caused the disruption of the Golden Pact, since Minas Gerais believed that they should still nominate the president since their term was interrupted, which São Paulo refused, believing it was a normal election, therefore São Paulo now had the right to choose the candidate, a disagreement that led both states to announce their own candidacy, splitting the oligarchic vote. This breakdown between São Paulo and Minas Gerais sparked political consciousness among the other states which had been forced to accept Paulista-Mineiro hegemony in the past, but now had an opportunity to make a bid for the presidency for the first time in 30 years. 

A coalition of northeastern and southern states agreed on the nomination of Rio Grande do Sul state deputy Getúlio Vargas, a rising star in Gaúcho politics with army connections, being himself an army veteran, as the presidential candidate with the Riograndense Republican Party ballot, leading a national coalition of state republican parties called the Aliança Liberal (Liberal Alliance). With the Paulista-Mineiro vote split between São Paulo's candidate Washington Luiz and Minas Gerais state president Antônio Carlos de Andrada, Vargas won the elections on a small, but safe margin, winning every state besides São Paulo and Minas Gerais.

**The Vargas presidency (1925-1928)**

After being inaugurated as president, Getúlio Vargas pushed through with a series of political reforms that aimed to at the same time liberalise the state and increase the power of the federal government, as a means to reduce the power of the Paulista and Mineiro elites. The new Electoral Code written in 1925 demanded that political parties have at least 1,000 registered members in 5 different states in order to participate in federal elections, putting an end to the era of state republican parties; secret ballots were also introduced to the electoral process, in order to ensure the secrecy of votes and to prevent harassment by national guards commanded by oligarchs. The new electoral legislation forced the creation of new political organisations: the Paulista-Mineiro right joined with Rio de Janeiro conservatives and other pro-agrarian politicians to form the União Republicana Nacional (National Republican Union); and from Vargas's camp, two new political parties were formed, the Aliança Liberal (Liberal Alliance) was officialised into a party by progressive army officers, state bureaucrats anti-oligarchy conservatives and republican parties from the Northeast; and the Partido Libertador (Liberation Party), which amassed the urban liberal intelligentsia and moderate trade unionists that didn't agree with the syndicalist leanings of the CGT-FSB. 

Reelection of the president of the republic and of state governors (renamed from ""state presidents"" by the same piece of legislation) to a second term was also introduced.
Besides reestructuring Brazilian politics, the Vargas government also sought to deal with the economic crisis that followed the breakdown of Brazil's international trade: in the agrarian sector, the National Coffee Institute (INC) was created in order to improve state policy in regards to their most valuable product. The INC coordenated investments in infrastructure related to coffee production and logistics and also bought surplus harvests to burn and maintain prices stable. In the industrial sector, new partnerships were established with Germany, the United States and Japan, which saw a greater influx of capital to the country. The government also established the Ministry of Education, introducing a state-level public education system and the mandatory enrollment of all children up to the age of 10, and created the first universities in Brazil, with the federal universities of Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco being founded in 1927.

Altough Vargas was a fairly popular president across the entire country, resentment to his takeover of national politics grew among the Paulista and Mineiro elites, and tensions grew into a quasi-civil war in western São Paulo in early 1928 when the Paulista national guard chased militants of a socialist peasant league across the state border into Paraná, and due to lack of communication, got intercepted by the Paraná national guard at the town of Bandeirantes, leading to an acidental skirmish between São Paulo and Paraná national guards, an incident that was remembered as the battle of Bandeirantes. The incident sparked federal response, with Vargas immediately passing a decree of federal intervention in São Paulo, an opportunistic move by the president, that aimed to create a precedent for the nationwide abolition of the national guards. The federal intervention was universally disapproved in the state of São Paulo, with state governor Júlio Prestes refusing to accept the federal decree and liberals taking to the capital city's streets, demanding an end to ""federal tyranny"" and the resignation of Vargas.

The crisis came extremely close to becoming a full-flegded civil war when the federal government ordered the São Paulo national guard to suppress the protesters and the National guard refused the call, which sparked Vargas to send the 1st cavalry division of the army stationed in Rio de Janeiro, without approval of the state government, to do the job. This move was extremely controversial within the administration and most importantly the army, since the general command was mostly composed of sons and brothers of the landed aristocracy of São Paulo, Rio and Minas Gerais, and they saw the move as ""a threat against national unity and stability"".

Other states saw the way the federal government treated the São Paulo crisis and fealt threatened by federal intervention, and the feeling of resentment against centralisation of power in the hands of the federal government grew, leading to protests against Vargas in northeastern capitals as well as Minas Gerais and the federal capital. Sensing the pressure closing in from all sides, Getúlio Vargas resigned as president in 24/08/1928, and vice-president João Pessoa took executive powers until the elections in November. Riding the wave of dissatisfaction with the Vargas administration, the URN won a landslide, securing every single state except the AL-PL bastion of Rio Grande do Sul for Júlio Prestes, who ran against AL candidate Pedro de Toledo, former president of the INC and Vargas's economic advisor. Besides the URN sweep, the most notable fact of the 1928 election was the performance of lebanese-brazilian trade unionist Abílio de Nequete, general secretary of the CGT-FSB who ran as an independent with the support of both the communists and Luís Carlos Prestes's group and secured 5% of the votes, going first place in the city of São Paulo.

**The Prestes presidency (1929-1936)**

Júlio Prestes's ascension to the presidency was viewed as a partial return to the pre-Vargas status quo, since the URN was the successor of the Golden Pact and the representatives of agrarianist politics in Brazil. However, Brazilian society going into the 1930s extremely different from what it was before the Weltkrieg: even though the agricultural sector was still stagnant, Brazil was industrializing in a fast and increasing pace and mass politics and mass culture was transforming Brazil, with modernist literature, and architecture replacing neoclassicism, cinema and radio broadcasts becoming more common and the idea of popular participation in politics becoming more prevalent, since the literacy rates increased from 10% in 1920 to more than 30% in 1930, which drastically increased the number of eligible voters in elections since literacy was a requirement for voting in the 1891 constitution. In the 1930 state gubernatorial elections, progressive candidates won many states in the Northeast, and notorious socialist Luís Carlos Prestes was almost elected governor of Rio Grande do Sul, only being stopped by a coalition of all right, center and moderate left parties led by Getúlio Vargas, who ironically came back to politics with the pivotal support of his bitter rivals in the URN.

Even though Prestes's ascension was a mandate of the right wing of Brazilian politics, his cabinet sought to appeal to a broad political spectrum, and seeked to normalise relations with France and Great Britain, even establishing a limited trade deal with France for exporting rubber and cotton to the Internationale. That didn't mean tensions with the organised left weren't present, in fact they steadily increased through the 1930s, and suspicions of Franco-British support to syndicalist trade unions in Brazil rose, with the CGT-FSB being banned in 1933.

Riding the rise of anti-socialist sentiment, the Ação Integralista Brasileira (Brazilian Integralist Action/AIB) was founded in 1931 by reactionary intellectuals Gustavo Barroso and Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, heavily influenced by the Integralismo Lusitano movement of Portugal, which rallied most of the remaining monarchists in Brazil to their cause; and also by spanish carlists, romanian national populists, the national-syndicalist movements across Europe and later by Savinkov's emerging populist movement in Russia. The AIB received tacit support by federal and state governments in their political activities, which revolved around beating up striking workers, harassing syndicalist and socialist movements and supporting the national guards as unofficial assault battalions in their clashes with peasant organisations in the countryside. 

The blind eye by the state allowed the integralist movement to become the largest political movement in Brazil by 1936, with more than one million members across the country.
With support from the landowner elites and the emerging industrial sector largely pleased, Júlio Prestes secured a confortable victory in the 1932 presidential elections, being the first brazilian president to be re-elected into office with 40% of the vote. However, signs of change were evident, with both the left and the far-right growing significantly in electoral influence, which translated to trade unionist and FSB member Minervino de Oliveira, who ran through the Partido Libertador but with full support both of the CGT-FSB and Luís Carlos Prestes's group receiving 25% of the national vote; and Plínio Salgado, president of the AIB and commander of the greenshirts, the integralist combat squadrons getting roughly 20%.

In the second Prestes presidency, Brazil's economic situation stabilised, with Germany, the USA and Japan gradually replacing the defunct United Kingdom as Brazil's economic metropoles, with at the same time the agricultural sector being profitable once again with heavy INC and Bank of Brazil sponsoring, and industrialisation continuing to develop, and spreading to cities other than São Paulo, with the rapid growth of urban centers like Curitiba, Belo Horizonte and Recife.

Even though the economy grew, political tensions between the left and the right skyrocketed, with the most important moment being the assassination of anarchist militant and CGT-FSB member Edgard Leuenroth by a greenshirt militia member, which sparked a week of intense confrontations between anarchists and syndicalist militias and the greenshirts, which culminated into an incident that was dubbed by progressive media as ""the fight of the green chickens"", a confrontation when the greenshirts were defeated by a formation of railroad union workers, then fled across the streets of downtown São Paulo, being chased by syndicalists across blocks, into restaurants, barbershops, inside busses and streetcars, until the São Paulo national guard was mobilised and stabilised the situation.

Besides political violence, banditry also grew in the northeastern countryside, with bands of ""cangaceiros"", outlaws that roamed through villages and farms, looting and stealing cattle, but also sometimes fighting alongside peasant leagues against landowners, becoming notorious and even famous across the country, with the most notable group being Virgulino da Silva's  gang, led by the man who was known as Lampião, notorious both for both his brutality and heinous crimes and also his fame as some sort of vigilante or deliverer of ""people's justice"" to the landowner class, which led him to be admired by a part of the peasantry. 

As a reaction to the increase in banditry, the federal government enacted a nationwide law enforcement reform that formally abolished the institution of state armies, but incorporated all of their contingents into the state national guards, effectively decentralising the armed forces even further, and also merging all municipal police forces into the state public forces (Forças Públicas), giving states tremendous political and military power. A federal police was also established in order to combat the bands of outlaws that travelled across state lines, and the Mobile Corps of Police (Turmas Volantes da Polícia) were created under the Federal Police as ad-hoc task forces that could bring together personnel from the national guards and public forces under federal control to be quickly deployed anywhere in the country.

**Political climate in 1936**

As of 1936, Júlio Prestes comes to the end of his presidency having accomplished most of his political goals, but the spectre of economic crisis looming from Germany threatens to undo most of the achievements of the right and destroy this ""oligarchy of the future"" established under Prestes. The presidential elections of 1936, which were expected to proceed smoothly, now stand as a pivotal moment that will determine the future of Brazil for decades to come.

The four likely presidential candidates are, from right to left: Plínio Salgado of the AIB, paramilitary commander and slandered as a ""Savinkov-wannabe"" by the liberal press; Borges de Medeiros of the AL, Rio Grande do Sul lawyer and self-described ""labour democrat"", supported by Vargas and the remnants of his clique; Antônio Carlos de Andrada of the URN, governor of Minas Gerais and Prestes's successor named by the party congress to make amends between Minas Gerais and São Paulo after a decade of Paulista hegemony over the Brazilian right; and João Mangabeira of the PL, a senator from Bahia chosen as a compromise candidate between the party's liberals and the social democratic left.

The front only slightly snaggled. *“Character”* I thought. I examined the face in detail as I always do. The ears were tight to the scalp. A milk-chocolate brown with green eyes and dyed black hair.  The smile on the lips looked practiced, but still honest. The lips a bit thinner than optimal, but that just added to the appealing humanity of the visage.

I winked the left eye and watched my counterpart do the same. I winked the other eye and then let the grin dim.

As I did, the barkeep snapped his towel over her shoulder and then rapped his knuckles on the counter.

“What will it be young man?” Her look was sour and skeptical.

“Nothing just now.” My tongue felt heavy as I spoke and I stuck it out to see a silvery stud in the middle of it.

“Not drinking, get a booth. Customers can use that stool.” The barkeep’s sour look was a frown of annoyance, tinged with suspicion and she beckoned to someone behind me.

“Ok, be cool.” I stood up and pushed through the throng about the bar. My vacated seat was immediately taken by a stout red-headed beauty. I stared briefly at her. Perhaps later a drink.

As I pushed through the crowd, I used my height and athletic bulk to force a path to the bathrooms. No line, and I walked into a three-stall tiled room. The mirror was a simple polished rectangle of steel just over a length of basin.

I stood before it and continued to stare at the face, enthralled by my look.

Should I be grinding even coarser till I notice the bed fully drain? Can anyone here shared your grind size in reference to the Kruger brewler scale?

Hi everyone:) I don’t have many friends and have been feeling really lonely. My Bible study group is clicky and they are already super close and do things together. I love our coffee dates and Bible studies, but I want more. More than just that. I want real friendships where we can do things other than Bible studies. I’ve been so alone for a lot of my life and wasted many years sitting home isolated. Most of my 20’s have been just me in my room. I’m feeling especially lonely and sad today with family issues, sick family members. I’ve been praying for close friends for so long I am so grateful to have the Bible study, but it isn’t the same. I initiated dinners in the past. Nobody else really initiates or invites me to things other than worship nights. I have a closer friend I made this year however she doesn’t ever ask me to do things. I’ve asked her in the past, but she is comfortable with just seeing me every Saturday for Bible study. I thought we felt close since we share the same problems and are going through similar things with our families, however she isn’t close to me. She doesn’t really make an effort. Everyone keeps saying it’ll get better but it hasn’t. I’m feeling really hopeless. I’m 24 and life is passing me by. I’m still mourning my past relationship. A family member has a chronically ill condition, she can barely walk and she lives with us. I carry all that sadness. I think about all she’s missed out on and it hurts. I carry so much pain. I just wish it would go away. I’ve started my walk with faith 3 years ago but I feel burnt out. The at group has made me feel burnt out. Since every single conversation is about the lord. I love the lord with my all and I love Jesus, but I also wanna enjoy other things. They speak badly about other religions and it’s starting to feel like I need to put on an act.

South Carolina is full of ghost stories, most of them cheap thrills born of boredom or drunken dares for teenagers. But Seven Devil’s Bridge? That one stuck with me. Not because I believed in restless spirits or midnight curses, but because i was once one of those bored teenagers, and although i didn't see anything, i heard...something, I've regrated hearing ever since. I didn't believe in ghosts. I just enjoyed fear, and in a smalltown there wasn't much to do. So one day a few friends and I went to go see the Seven Devils Bridge.



The night we went to Seven Devil’s Bridge was thick with humidity, nothing new For South Carolina, it was often hot and humid. The air so still it felt like the world was holding its breath. The road leading up to the bridge was barely visible, swallowed by trees that loomed in from both sides, backroads upon backroads. My friends joked and shoved each other, their laughter sharp against the quiet, but I wasn’t laughing. I was listening, the air felt electric, and i felt something....different.



We stood on the bridge, waiting. The legend said that if you crossed at midnight, you wouldn’t make it to the other side. A lot of nonsense, I thought. Still, we were bored, and just wanted to get out of the house, this was supposed to be just another thing to do, to kill time. So I leaned against the rusted railing, staring down at the shallow creek below, waiting for something, anything to happen, to prove me wrong.



That’s when I heard it. A low cry? It was almost melodic, but broken, fragmented. 

Like sound whispering through static. My head snapped toward my friends, but they were still laughing, still shoving, completely unaware.



The sound twisted, shifting between notes, growing more distinct. Now just a hum. A voice? But the words were impossible to understand. My pulse hammered. I tried to shake it off, tried to tell myself it was the wind, the water below, some trick of my tired mind, but it was gone now, The wind blew gently, the slow flow of water in the creak droned, yet i didn’t move. The sound, whatever it was, now gone, but the feeling of being watched remained.



""what was that?"" i wasn't sure if i was asking myself, my friends or the air, my two friends looked at me amused.

""what are you actually getting freaked out?"" Dale asked, a smirk on his face, while James was dicking around on his phone....did i imagine it? 

Trying to shrug the overwhelming feeling of eyes on me i simply suggested we should go get a bit to eat on the way home, and we left, my friends still lulling about, i found myself antsy, slowing my walking to match there pace.

""get ahold of yourself pussy"" i remember telling myself before pushing my thoughts away as we drove away from Seven Devils Bridge





The drive home should have put it out of my mind. Dale and James kept up their usual antics, arguing over where to grab food, complaining about how dead the town was, but I barely heard them, there in body alone. I kept glancing at the rearview mirror, almost waiting to see something lurking behind us. Nothing. Just the empty road stretching into the night.



Then the first time I heard it again, I was alone.



It was the next morning, in my room, just before sunrise. That same sound, quiet as a hum, distant but impossible to ignore. My stomach twisted. I sat up, listening, holding my breath. It sounded closer now. Like it was inside.



I turned toward my closet, setting ajar, hadn't i closed it the night before? i couldn't remember, i couldn't be sure.

No. No way. I got up, slammed it shut. The humming faded slowly.



For a while, i just sat there, unsure of what i heard, then my alarm went off, I jolted up again as if just waking up, ""was that real...was i dreaming? the uncertainty bleeding reality into fiction. 



At school, it was worse. I was spacing out in class, (i was usually sleeping in class but i felt so wired) then i thought i heard it again. Not a cry this time. Words. Garbled, slipping between syllables like a language I knew but couldn't understand. I looked around but no one else reacted. I pressed my palms against my face, squeezing my eyes shut.



""Not real. Not real."" i thought like a mantra i could will into existence.



But when I opened them, my hands...they weren’t my hands.



They looked...wrong. Smaller? Thinner? Not mine. Not human?



I blinked, and they were normal again. A distant voice in my ear let out a sharp laugh before fading into nothing.



what i felt then wasn't just fear. i was frozen in place, the bell rang but i sat there, not moving till i heard the shovel of the next classes feet. i quickly got up, shaking, sweating, and darted out of the room and into the bathroom, after emptying my stomach and leaving the restroom i had one thought, ""Fuck This"".

Within the next 15 minutes i was getting into my friends old white chevy truck and we were peeling outta the parking lot, i remember thinking ""eh at least i showed up today"" to clarify i wasn't a great student.

For the next few days, life settled back into the usual haze of wasted hours and half-hearted decisions. No whispers. No voices. No twisted hallucinations.



I convinced myself it had all been some weird trick of exhaustion, or the mind, maybe both, maybe a leftover fear from that damn bridge. So I let it go. I spent the afternoons gaming with Dale and James, trash talking, losing track of time until the sky outside turned deep blue. I skipped school like usual, slept till noon, smoked just enough to keep reality soft around the edges.



It was easy to pretend nothing had happened. Then, it came back, like a distant hum, it came back.



I was at Dale’s place, leaned back on his busted couch, controller in hand, barely focused on some yet another match we were winning or losing. James was rolling a blunt, moaning about how expensive good weed was getting. just another day. A normal day.



And then—the hum. Low and fractured. The kind of sound you’d hear if someone was standing just behind you, breathing words through gritted teeth, something more primal than anger. I stiffened.



James flicked his lighter, exhaling smoke. Dale cursed at the screen. Neither of them heard it. life parading on around me.



I swallowed hard, eyes darting toward the darkened hallway leading out of the living room we called home. Something was standing there, just a shape. Unmoving. Wrong.



I stared. Blinked. Gone.



I exhaled slowly, forcing a smirk, forcing myself back into the game. This wasn’t real. It wasn’t i told myself.



I took a deep inhale, letting the smoke roll through my lungs, heavier than it should’ve been. Relax. That’s what I needed. That’s what I told myself.



Dale was still talking, something about his ex and how she was “certifiably insane.” James was focused on rolling another blunt, eyes lazily tracking the process like it was second nature. Everything was normal. I was normal. This was normal.



Then—the sound. Subtle. Weaving between the static of the TV in the background. Like a breath beneath the silence.



I froze. focusing on the sound, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Paranoia. Overthinking.



Then, the voice came, low, sharp, slicing through the air like a blade.



""You are not alone.""



I choked on my breath, coughing violently, nearly knocking the coffee table over as i shot up and stumbled.



James frowned at me. Dale paused mid-sentence.



""You good?"" Dale asked, raising an eyebrow. I tried to speak, but my throat was locked up, my heart hammering against my ribs. Not alone? What the hell did that mean?



My head snapped toward the hallway again...nothing. But I swore I felt something standing there, watching. Breathing.



I gripped the edge of the couch, my pulse thundering, the high suffocating me instead of calming me.



James flicked his lighter, eyes narrowing. “You sure your good bro? something up?”



I let out a sharp, nervous laugh. it felt loud and forced.



""Nah, man, shit just hit me harder than I expected,"" I lied, forcing a smirk, wiping sweat from my forehead.



I was not alone. And i silently hoped i was just losing my mind.



The tension had reached a breaking point. I wasn’t hiding it well anymore, i couldn't, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, the way I flinched at sounds no one else seemed to hear. Dale and James had started watching me, their jokes turning into quiet questions, uneasy glances. I could see it in their faces, they knew something was wrong.



Finally, James snapped.



“Look, man, what the hell is up with you?” he asked, blunt tucked behind his ear, arms crossed. “You’ve been losing your mind ever since we went to the bridge.”



Dale nodded, leaning against his truck. “Yeah. You ain’t exactly subtle.”



I opened my mouth to lie, to brush it off, but I couldn’t. swallowing the lump in my throat i simply asked



“You think it started there?” voice hollow.



James and Dale exchanged a glance.



“I Guess...That’s the only thing that makes sense,” Dale said. “You were normal before.”



That word normal, hearing it in the context hurt.



James exhaled sharply. “Then maybe we gotta go back.”



My pulse spiked. “What?”



He shrugged. “Think about it. Maybe it’s like… I don’t know. maybe going back will help you chill out.”



Dale shrugged. “fuck it why not?”



I wanted to argue, I really did. But the voice—the one that had been whispering in my ear for days—had said something, hadn’t it?



""Come back."" ""Fix it.""



Against every ounce of logic in my body, in cold sweat I agreed.



Seven Devil’s Bridge looked different this night.



We stood at the edge, headlights casting long shadows over the cracked pavement, the quiet suffocating from all sides.



Dale was tense. James was still trying to act casual. But I? I felt sick.



“I don’t get it,” Dale muttered. “What are we even supposed to do?”



James shrugged. “See if something happens.”



I exhaled slowly, stepping forward. The air felt wrong, like the pressure had shifted. My hands shook, but I shoved them into my hoodie pockets. I had to do this.



Then, the humming began. Not distant this time. Not faint. Loud. Surrounding us. Wrapping around us like a silent beast.



Dale cursed, stepping back. James stiffened. They heard it...they HEARD IT!



Then we saw them. Seven figures. Hanging from the bridge.



Still. Twisting. Watching. crying.



Dale moved first.



A strangled sound escaped him, something between a scream and a curse, but he didn't stop to process what he was seeing. He ran.



James followed, stumbling backward, dragging me with him. His grip was tight, nails digging into my wrist, pulling me toward the truck like he was afraid the ground might swallow us.



Yet I hesitated. Not because I wanted to stay, but because the figures had turned their heads toward us.



Seven sets of hollow, bloodshot eyes, locked onto mine. Their swollen maggot filled mouths twisted, open but not speaking, tongues blackened and shriveled from the noose around their throats. But I heard them anyway.



""Come back."" ""left us."" ""Fix it.""



Then one of them moved.

e rope, a wet, tearing  gurgling sound filling the air.



Everything became a blur, before i knew what i had done I ran.



The truck door slammed behind me, Dale fumbling with the keys, James breathing hard beside me. The engine roared to life, the tires kicking gravel as we sped away, the bridge shrinking in the distance.



But the voices never faded, becoming a constant hum.



By the time we reached town, Dale’s hands were shaking too much to hold his phone, and James had gone silent—just staring at the road ahead, eyes wide, unblinking.



I sat in the back, gripping my knees, pulse hammering. Because even though we had left...I could still see them.



Now, they weren’t just at the bridge. They were everywhere.

A violent jerk, body convulsing against the rope.



The bridge never let us go. after that second visit, after we saw those...things, everything got worse. The air around us felt heavier, like we were dragging something unseen everywhere we went.



At first, I thought it was just me. The noises hadn’t stopped. It followed me home, curling beneath the sound of my breathing, hiding under the flicker of my bedroom light.



Then James called.



“I saw it again,” he whispered. “The bridge. But I wasn’t there. I was in my room, but when I blinked I-I was hanging from it.” Then Dale was next.



He slammed his palms against the hood of his truck one afternoon, shaking his head like he was trying to wake up. “I keep seeing them..Everywhere. In the mirror. Outside my window. In the backseat when I drive. They don’t move...but they’re watching.”



And me? I was drowning in it. The hallucinations weren’t just flickers anymore. They were vivid. Brutal.



I couldn’t tell if I was awake or dreaming, because every time I blinked, I saw them die, at times, seeing US die.



The first man—he kicked. Struggled. His fingers clawed at the rope around his neck, body convulsing as blood pooled behind his eyes.



The second. Silent. Motionless. Accepting the fate she'd been given.



The third screamed, a raw, splintering sound that tore through my skull, his mouth twisted open as if the air had been ripped from his lungs.



And the rest, they watched me.



Even as they hung—the stares burned into me. 



I gripped my desk, panting, choking on air, the classroom around me collapsing into static. Dale and James were looking at me.



They knew. Because now, they had seen it too.



The days after the second visit blurred into something fractured. None of us could hold onto reality the way we used to.



Yet I wasn’t alone anymore. Now, Dale and James heard them too.



The voices had spread like an infection, crawling into our lives, twisting in ways none of us could ignore. And the hallucinations were worse.



after me, James saw them after.



It was late, maybe two in the morning, when he called. His voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.



“They’re here.”



I sat up, gripping my phone. “Where?”



“My room.” His breath hitched. “Hanging. From the ceiling.”



A hollow silence stretched between us. I tried to think, maybe he was just seeing it, just reliving the moment, but then, his voice cracked.



“They’re moving this time.”



I couldn’t respond. Because I knew James was right.



It wasn’t just frozen images anymore. They were changing. Shifting. Growing closer, i had seen them as well.



Then Dale had his turn.



I met up with him a few days later, standing outside his truck, the air thick with weed smoke and something wrong.



“I can’t look in my mirrors anymore,” he muttered, staring past me, eyes red-rimmed and dry. “Every time I do, I see one of them behind me.”



I swallowed hard. He dragged a hand through his hair. “I think it’s getting worse.”



And I knew he was right. Because now, they weren’t just hanging from the bridge.



They were hanging from us. 



The unraveling was slow, but inevitable, I should’ve seen it coming.



One day sitting in Dale’s truck, parked behind the abandoned gas station on the edge of town. a regular hang out spot for us, James was jittery, legs bouncing, knuckles tight around a half-smoked cigarette. Dale was eerily still, staring ahead, barely blinking.



The silence between us felt wrong, uncomfortable, heavy, suffocating, buzzing with something we couldn’t name.



Then Dale twitched. A sharp inhale. Fingers curling into fists. His jaw locked.



“Dale?” I frowned, shifting toward him. “You good?”



He didn’t answer. Instead, his head snapped toward James, eyes wide, wild, like he didn’t recognize him.



And then, he lunged.



James barely had time to react before Dale’s hands were around his throat, knocking him back against the passenger door.



“Dude!” I shouted, scrambling to pull him off.



James choked, gasping, nails digging into Dale’s arms, struggling to push him away, but Dale’s grip tightened.



His eyes weren’t normal, they were bloodshot, blown wide, like something else was looking through them.



And then he spoke. though it wasn’t his voice.



""You crossed the bridge."" ""You left us there."" ""Why did you leave?""



My stomach dropped.



I grabbed Dale, yanking him back with everything I had, forcing him against the seat, pinning his wrists.



James coughed violently, sucking in air, shaking all over.



Dale blinked fast—something snapped back into place. His face crumpled, realization hitting like a freight train.



“Oh my God,” he whispered. His whole body trembled, eyes darting between me and James. “I—I didn’t mean to—I don’t know what—”



James was still catching his breath, rubbing his throat. His expression wasn’t angry. It was terrified.



Dale’s hands trembled as he reached for James, stopping short. both were terrified.



“I don’t know what happened,” he breathed. “I swear to God, I wasn’t—I don’t even remember—”



None of us knew what to say. Because deep down, we knew the truth. It wasn’t Dale.



Not really.



The next week passed in a haze of frantic research and uneasy silence.



None of us wanted to talk about what happened in the truck. Dale afraid to ask for forgiveness, and would James even accept it? We moved carefully around each other, conversations clipped, tensions hanging in the air like fog.



But the whispers never stopped.



James buried himself in old news articles, digging through anything that mentioned Seven Devil’s Bridge. He found scraps, bits of folklore, missing persons reports, vague warnings dating back decades.



Dale spent nights glued to his laptop, scrolling through conspiracy forums, desperate for anything that felt familiar. And me? I was lost, just listened.



Slowly the voices were changing.



""You don’t belong."" ""you never left. ""Fix it.""



The more we searched, the worse it got as time passed, Reality slipped.



And then James woke up wrong.



I got a call at dawn, his voice shaking, not normal, not James.



“I—I don’t—” His breath came sharp, clipped, uneven. “There’s blood in my bed.”



I sat up fast, heart hammering, the fog of sleep washing away quickly. “What?”



“I-I...don’t know where it came from.” His voice cracked. “I....don’t know if it’s mine.”



Something cold settled in my stomach. ""Did he-no....no""



Dale and I rushed over.



James was waiting for us on his porch, skin pale, pupils blown wide like he hadn’t slept. He led us into his home, slowly, reluctant.

It dawned on me that he hadn't been inside since our call.



The sheets, soaked. Rust-colored, thick, too much blood for one person.



But James had no wounds, Nothing at all, Nothing on him. And the worst part?



When Dale pulled back the blankets, there were handprints.



Seven of them. Smudged into the fabric, fingers long, warped.



close but not human, i swear i saw claw marks, but couldn't be sure.



James sat on the floor, shaking, staring at his hands like they weren’t his. “I don’t—I don’t remember falling asleep.”



Dale swallowed hard. “maybe you didn’t?”



None of us had an answer, because now, it wasn’t just hallucinations anymore.



It was real, and we couldn't differentiate reality from fiction anymore, reality and ""fiction"" were melding together. 



Desperation led us back.



After a week of finding nothing, no explanations, no answers, just more paranoia, we had no choice.



We didn’t talk much on the drive. Dale gripped the wheel, white knuckled, pale faced. James sat rigid, hands tucked under his arms as if he was trying to keep them from shaking.



And me? I listened, lost in a haze of fear and confusion.



The humming had changed. It wasn’t just a whisper, slowly, it became like music. With Notes bent, broken, twisting through the air like a sound that had never been meant for human ears, yet still alluring.



By the time we arrived, the moon sat heavy in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. The bridge loomed ahead, every shadow dancing in my mind.



None of us moved at first. Like we were waiting—for permission.



Then James let out a breath. “We go together.” Dale nodded stiffly.



I swallowed hard. “Yeah.”



And we stepped forward. Back into whatever this was we had stubbled into, whatever had never really let us go.

It felt as though the bridge let us in before we had the chance to change our minds.



The moment our feet hit the wood, the air shifted—thicker, heavier, like space was compressing around us. Everything sounded wrong, felt...wrong.



James sucked in a breath. “Do you feel that?”



None of us answered. We all felt it. Then, reality bled away.



Dale was the first to break.



His eyes widened, breath coming in short bursts as he reached for the side of his head. “No,” he whispered. “They’re inside—I can feel them, I can hear them!”



I turned toward him, stepping closer, but he screamed.



Not just a yell, a raw, primal shriek of terror.



“Get away!” He stumbled back, eyes locked onto something that wasn’t there. His hands twitched like he was trying to claw something out of his own skin.



James grabbed him, voice sharp. “Dale, it’s not real!”



But Dale wasn’t listening. Then James froze.



His face slackened, breath hitching as his gaze lifted toward the bridge, as if he saw something standing there, watching us.



His lips trembled. ""They're moving.""



And then was my turn.



The world fractured around me. The air bled. The bridge split open, spilling its rotted history out into the night.



And something crawled toward me. Not human. Not alive. A writhing puddle of limbs bent the wrong way, its mouth a gaping pit of blackened teeth, flies and maggots flowing out.



It lunged. I didn’t think, I couldn't, I just swung.



The force of the hit sent it sprawling. I didn’t stop, Terror, rage and delirium fueling me.



My fists landed, again, and again, crushing, tearing, breaking. It twitched beneath me, convulsed, cracked, final-



And then I blinked. The hallucination melted away.



And James lay beneath me.



Breathing ragged. Bleeding, Then he wasn't breathing at all. His body lay twisted, throat slack, eyes wide, yet unseeing.



Blood pooled beneath his cracked skull, soaking into the rotting wood. His chest didn’t rise, didn't fall, Didn’t move.



James was dead and it was my fault.



Dale was on his knees now, hands tangled in his hair, rocking slightly, whispering something, but his words I couldn’t be heard over the humming.



The bridge had taken James and we were still standing on it.



Dale moved before I could say anything.



One second, he was kneeling beside James’s body, face pale, hands shaking. The next, he was running.



Away from the bridge. Away from me.



“No—Dale, wait!” I scrambled to my feet, my pulse roaring in my ears. My hands were still wet with blood...James’s blood.



Dale didn't stop.



His breath came ragged, sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade as he ran toward the road. Toward the way out.



I didn't know what else to do, so i chased after him.



I could hear my own voice, raw, desperate. “Dale, listen to me—please! I didn’t mean to! I didn’t—”



He wasn’t listening. Then he slowed.



His footsteps faltered, his pace uneven, then he stopped completely.



I nearly crashed into him, gasping, grabbing his arm. “Dale, we have to—”



Then I saw it. The bridge was still in front of us.



Even though we had been running the opposite way, even though we should’ve left it [behind.it](http://behind.it) was still there.



Like we hadn’t moved at all.



Dale staggered back, shaking his head, his breath quick and shallow. “No—no, this isn’t right. This isn’t—”



My stomach turned as i whipped around, looking back the way we’d come—but it was the same.



Wooden planks stretching endlessly in both directions. No exit. No road.

 

Just the bridge and all around us, the humming grew louder.



Dale snapped.



The weight of everything, the hallucinations, the never ending bridge, James’s death, everything crashed into him at once.



He whirled around, his face twisted with rage and grief, his breath sharp, uneven.



“You killed him!” His voice was raw, cracking like something inside him had finally broken. “You—James is dead because of you!”



My heart dropped, a truth i refused to accept.



“I—I thought I was fighting....something” My words came out frantic, desperate, but Dale wasn’t listening.



""You always thought you were fighting something!"" Dale's hands shook, his body tense with something more than fear. Hate. Betrayal. Terror. ""Maybe it's YOU that’s the problem! maybe this place wanted you, not us!""



I flinched. the words i had thought hurt so much more to hear aloud.



Dale was breathing fast now, eyes darting wildly, his voice tearing through the air like a knife.



“You think I can ever forget what I just saw?"" he hissed. ""You think I can just live with this?!”



I moved toward him, hands raised, pleading. ""Dale, please—we have to get out of here, we have to—”



He shook his head violently, staggering backward, eyes glassy and frantic. ""There’s no way out!""



And then. we saw it. From the shadows of the bridge, something stirred.



A shape. A rotting, twisting thing, its limbs bent at unnatural angles, its flesh torn and leaking, bones jutting through in jagged, uneven splinters.



Its head tilted, too far, its mouth wrong. Breathing, Watching. Waiting.



But the humming, the damn endless, suffocating hum...was gone...



In its place, James’s voice.



""Come closer."" ""Don't left me."" ""You can’t leave too.""



A whisper. Soft, almost pleading, curling through the air around us, threading into our bones.



Dale froze, I couldn’t breathe, James was dead. we knew that. We saw it. i DID it.



But his voice didn’t care because now, it wanted us too.



Then the voices came all at once, an explosion of whispers, a chorus of the dead, words tangled and overlapping, crawling into our ears like rot.



""Dont leave us."" ""You belong here."" ""Come closer."" ""Make it right.""



Dale screamed.



He clutched his head, stumbling back, his breath ragged and sharp, his mind fracturing beneath the weight of voices that weren’t his.



“Shut up!” he gasped. “Shut up!”



But they wouldn't stop.



I tried to reach for him, tried to pull him back, but something had already tswisted or snapped within him.



His movements turned jerky, erratic. His pupils blown wide, unfocused, lost.



And then, the glint of metal, A pocket knife.



Dale lunged.



I barely moved in time, the blade sliced the air, narrowly missing my throat.



""Dale!"" My voice cracked, frantic. ""Stop! It's me!""



But was it Dale anymore? i couldn't be sure.



His breathing hitched, hands trembling, eyes wild and not his own.



""Fix it.""



""You crossed the bridge.""



""Don't leave us.""



The voices pushed him forward.



I grabbed at his wrist, forcing it away, but he seemed stronger now. Or maybe something else was inside him.



The struggle blurred, violent, desperate.



Blood. My own? His? Both?



The knife twisted, slipped from his grip, clattered onto the wood.



Dale staggered back, chest heaving, eyes flickering between recognition and something else.



I didn’t move.



Because now, the bridge was waiting.



Blood pooled at our feet.



I didn’t know whose at first. mine? his? both? but I felt it, warm against my skin, soaking into the decayed wood beneath us.



Dale staggered back, his breath coming in jagged gasps, eyes flickering between horror and realization.



I clutched my side, fingers pressing against the sharp tear in my shirt, the sting beneath it. I’d been cut, fairly deep.



But Dale, Dale was worse.



A gash ran along his arm, deep, trembling, red spilling between his fingers as he tried to press against it.



We stared at each other, shaken, ruined, Then Dale’s face collapsed.



His breath came faster, sharp and uneven, like everything inside him was unraveling all at once.



“I—I did that,” he stammered, voice broken. He shook his head violently, like he could erase what had just happened. “I hurt you. I hurt—”



His gaze flickered toward James’s body. The blood. The twisted, motionless shape.



“No.” Dale’s voice cracked. His hands trembled. “I didn’t—this wasn’t supposed to—”



I stepped forward, ignoring the sting in my side. “Dale, listen to me, we have to figure this—”



“How am I supposed to figure this out?!” His voice rose, tight, unhinged. “James is dead! I tried to kill you! I don’t—”



He cut himself off, his chest heaving, his hands gripping his own hair. His breath hitched.



And then, I saw the moment he decided.



The shift in his posture. The way his body stilled, false calmness in the moment.



“I can’t do this anymore.”



""Dale—""



His hands moved too fast, the knife flashed—



And then his throat was open.



The sound that escaped his lips was small, broken, not meant for the world to hear.



I lurched forward, catching him as his body buckled, dragging him onto my lap, pressing my hands against the wound—but it didn’t matter.



There was too much blood.



""Dale—Dale!"" My voice cracked, shook, choked on something that felt like glass in my throat.



His mouth moved, but the words didn’t come. His fingers twitched against mine, then went still.



The bridge watched.



The voices whispered.



And Dale, he was gone.

I felt the bridge breathe.



I was alone now, or maybe I never had been. Maybe I had always belonged here, just waiting for my turn.



James lay twisted where I left him.



Dale’s body was slack, broken, the knife still loosely in his fingers, his blood pooling in sick rivulets.



And me? I had nowhere left to run.



The moment Dale’s body went still, everything erupted. The whispers turned to screams.



James’s voice. Dale’s voice. A chorus of them. Layered, overlapping, raw, hateful. 



""You did this.""



""You killed me.""



""we’re still here.""



""You belong here.""



I clutched my head, pressing my palms against my temples, trying to drown them out, but no, it was inside me now.



They were inside me. Then the hallucinations ripped open.



James stood in front of me, neck twisted, his lips curled into something between a grin and a snarl.



His throat moved, but I saw the gash, the ruined flesh, the blood still dripping and spurting.



""I woke up in blood.""



Dale trembled beside him, his hands wrapped around his own throat, gasping like he was still trying to breathe.



""You did this.""



I stumbled away. no, no, no, they were dead, they were dead, they were dead!



And then, the bridge changed.



The planks beneath me twisted, rotted, pulsed. The air shifted, thick with something I could feel crawling into my lungs.



Everything bent, distorted, splintered apart until there was only darkness.



And the sound of laughter.



Not mine. Not Dale’s. Not James’s.



Something else. Something that had been waiting all along.



The bridge had taken everything.



James. Dale. Reality itself. I had nothing left, except the truth it was forcing me to see.



The voices didn’t stop. They slithered around me, wrapping into my thoughts, twisting into something that felt more real than my own skin.



""You never left.""



""You belong here.""



""This is where you stay.""



But then...blackness.



Everything tore away, I woke up somewhere else.



Cold metal beneath me. Bright lights overhead.



For a moment, I thought I was dead. that the bridge had finally finished what it started.



God no! the voices...wait



Real voices? Not whispers.



“…Found him wandering. Covered in blood-most of it wasn’t his.”



“…Two confirmed deaths. Dale and James. Killed on the bridge. But the way we found them—”



“…Rambling. Hallucinating. Won’t stop talking about the bridge.”



I realized a pressure around my wrists. Restrained. I twisted, blinking fast. White walls. Clinical air.



Not the bridge, but I was still trapped.



Weeks passed. Month perhaps? I didn't know because none of it was mine anymore.



The cops labeled it murder. The psychiatric evaluations labeled it delusion.



They didn’t believe me. Hell, they couldn’t believe me.



And now, I sit in a windowless room, retelling my story one last time.



My voice was hollow, Distant, and at the end, when I had nothing left to say. I exhaled slowly.



Then, I reached for the only thing I had left.



A sharpened edge. One last choice. Before the bridge could take me back.



Am I crazy? Or was the bridge real? Either way, I still hear the distant, alluring hum, inviting me home.",1,1768695305.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

My Bible study group is clicky and they are already super close and do things together. I love our coffee dates and Bible studies, but I want more. More than just that. I want real friendships where we can do things other than Bible studies. I’ve been so alone for a lot of my life and wasted many years sitting home isolated. Most of my 20’s have been just me in my room. I’m feeling especially lonely and sad today with family issues, sick family members. I’ve been praying for close friends for so long I am so grateful to have the Bible study, but it isn’t the same. I initiated dinners in the past. Nobody else really initiates or invites me to things other than worship nights. I have a closer friend I made this year however she doesn’t ever ask me to do things. I’ve asked her in the past, but she is comfortable with just seeing me every Saturday for Bible study. I thought we felt close since we share the same problems and are going through similar things with our families, however she isn’t close to me. She doesn’t really make an effort. Everyone keeps saying it’ll get better but it hasn’t. I’m feeling really hopeless. I’m 24 and life is passing me by. I’m still mourning my past relationship. A family member has a chronically ill condition, she can barely walk and she lives with us. I carry all that sadness. I think about all she’s missed out on and it hurts. I carry so much pain. I just wish it would go away. I’ve started my walk with faith 3 years ago but I feel burnt out. The at group has made me feel burnt out. Since every single conversation is about the lord. I love the lord with my all and I love Jesus, but I also wanna enjoy other things. They speak badly about other religions and it’s starting to feel like I need to put on an act. I feel robotic and if I slip up and swear I have to apologize. I’m so confused. ",1,1768695246.0,depression,0,1.0,False

In those moments I was so desperate to try to speed run my healing but I couldn't I could only stay the course. In week two and three clarity hit me like a truck it was only after the tirade of emotional turmoil that I realized I was miserable as fuck for a long time in that relationship. His actions, words, and choices became glaringly apparent that he was not a man that I could respect. In those moments I was grateful for the harsh reality it propelled me forward into the next phase. I got my life together, found joy in the things I once loved that I lost, and most of all I was being noticed. I felt alive again and also hot as fuck and that is powerful. It has become fun to flirt, have my eyes linger a little too long, or knowing the allure I carry.

I was waiting in line sa isang coffee shop and there's only 1 counter open which was yung priority lane. Yung cashier, ready na itake yung order ko kasi ako lang naman nasa pila then this lady and her friend, pumila sila just when I was about to say my order. As in tunog nalang lalabas sa bunganga ko. Dumerecho siya sa unahan ko. Tapos sabi niya sa friend niya, ""dun siya,  dun siya (ako daw dapat lumipat/nakapila sa closed counter) tayo kasi priority"". 

Hahahuehue this part like di ko kaya icontrol yung pagkabanas ko sa face. Kasi sa isip ko din wtf. Yung cashier humihingi ng pasensya (di naman niya fault). Yung friend, kinukuha yung tingin ko to say sorry, di ko matignan eh, samantalang si auntie, jina-justify sarili niya ""dun siya, dito tayo sa priority eh"". Pero di ko talaga sila tinitignan kasi it was not okay for me and baka magkasala pa ko kapag may nabitawan pa ko or magawa to make it worse. I was addressing the cashier na it's okay, but hindi sa kasama niya na nagsosorry eyes. Alam niya naman pala mali ginawa ng kasama niya diba. 

Sarado nga yung next counter. So ending, nagsabi agad yung cashier na iopen yung kabilang counter. 

Ang naiinis siguro ako na part is, yung order nung SC is for a group of 3 people. Drinks and food and while choosing, syempre ang tagal nila sa counter while mine just took 1-2mins lang including payment. 

Napaisip lang ako if tama ba na iniisip ko na entitled siya, first time ko maexperience to tho, like her non SC/PWD friends can fall in line naman for her. My unsolicited opinion is they can place priority orders kung mismong order lang for themselves as an sc or pwd but to place an order for a GROUP of adults just for the sake of being served first is kinda douchy.

Ending: after getting our orders, sa harap ko pa pala sila nakaupo haha kainis. If they felt a bit uncomfortable (kasi naka ilang glance sakin yung dalawa), wala na ko dun. I was minding my own business and wala din ako malilipatan na table. Bahala sila jan.

I would love to get calcium through food but I hate dairy.  The problem is I drink no milk or tea or coffee. I very seldom eat cheese or butter. I don't like yogurt. 

Nor do I care for sardines, salmon, tofu, green leafy vegetables.

But I eat 10 peeled almonds first thing every morning. Should I make that 20?

 is 10 enough to get enough calcium for the day? 

I am sure I read somewhere that one should not eat more than 10 almonds a day. I am not sure why

I found this very cheap calcium on Amazon:

I was only interested in it because it is the cheapest I could find.

Can anyone tell me if you think it is safe to take? I worry that taking supplements will make calcium deposit in the wrong places. 

The above supplement has K2 (MK7), Zinc, Magnesium & Cissus. Will all these help the calcium absorb better?

I get no sun on my skin at all since I always protect my skin from the sun with hats and clothing.

It has Vitamin D3, K2 MK7 with B12.

I also take a magnesium supplement every night.

In Another forum someone told me: 

I would not take that calcium supplement. It has 100% the RDA of calcium. Supplements are supposed to supplement your food intake, not replace it completely. Chances are if you're eating a regular diet, you're already getting most of the calcium you need. Too much calcium is a bad thing.

Also, that supplement has calcium carbonate. Which is not easily absorbed by the body. The best form of calcium to supplement is dicalcium malate. It's very bioavailable, and is less harsh on your digestive tract than calcium citrate.
By not easily absorbed by the body, do you mean the calcium will deposit in the wrong places?

****

What if I take it one month on and one month off so that there is no build up?

Instead of the supplement dicalcium malate, is it better if I take 50 grams of yogurt a day? 

 The problem is I really hate the taste. I can do it for a few days but then I give up.

1qft3og,https://www.reddit.com/r/relocating/comments/1qft3og/feeling_stuck_after_moving_to_maine/,Feeling stuck after moving to Maine,"Hello, people of Reddit. I’m hoping for some perspective and location suggestions as my partner and I figure out our next move.

In 2024, my partner and I moved to Maine from Pennsylvania. I grew up in central PA, went to college in New England, and after graduating tried moving back to PA—but I quickly realized it wasn’t for me. It felt crowded yet isolating, traffic was exhausting, and I struggled to feel happy there. When I landed an exciting job in Maine a few years later, we decided to take a leap.

Maine has been incredibly healing for us in many ways. We love the water, the scenery, and the slower pace. Unfortunately, my job turned out to be a poor fit—difficult workplace dynamics and work that wasn’t what I expected. I stayed because the pay was great and the position was funded for two years, but due to changes in federal funding I was laid off. For the past six months, I’ve struggled to find new work. With major funding cuts, environmental/agriculture/conservation jobs here are extremely limited right now.

That’s left us feeling stuck. As much as we love Maine, staying no longer feels realistic if I can't find work, and while this place has been meaningful, I’ve also never felt like it was *exactly* right for me long-term.

So we’re going back to the drawing board and would love help brainstorming different cities to live in that checks a lot of our boxes.

* Coastal or college town (or both)
* Near the ocean or other clean body of water to swim
* Young, outdoorsy community
* yarn shop nearby
* many coffee shops
* Thrift/antique shops
* Beautiful scenery
* Easy access to hiking and walking trails
* Strong food scene
* Not overly commercial or hugely populated, thinking maybe a city around 70k people or less?
* Car-friendly (multi-car household, manageable traffic)
* Close enough to drive to big-box shopping (Target, Aldi, Trader Joe’s, etc.)

If you’ve lived somewhere similar, considered a move like this, or work in these fields, I’d love to hear your suggestions or experiences. Thank you so much in advance.",0,1768694573.0,relocating,8,0.33,False

I fucked up and I just have so much regret.,"This was my first gf since I was in the navy and got out We went out for 5 months, it’s been 7 since the breakup. It really fucked me (24M now 25) This all happened cuz I accepted a friend request on Snapchat (she also used the app as well) of someone I knew in a non romantic way. She saw the notification come in as she(25F now 26) had her head rested on my shoulder. She asked who it was, I told her honestly who it was and it was weird they added me and I was curious what they wanted. A day later she said it made her feel uncomfortable and I said no problem I’ll unadd them. I’m sorry for making you feel that way. What ur asking is reasonable, I like how we’re both being reasonable. We were at the beach that day and I got sun poisoning. Fast forward I was supposed to mow my lawn for my mom (we both lived at home in separate houses) it didn’t get done that weekend cuz I had bad sun poisoning and had to call out of work. She said I broke my word to my mom and she didn’t like the whole excuse thing as I should’ve done it the day I got home from work when I told her I was bored. I told Her my word is important as well but the lawn isn’t something to be this upset about. I fell asleep mid argument cuz I had work at 4am(power plant engineer) and I was so tired. I didn’t text her from 9pm-11am the next day cuz when I got into work I was super busy. She said I ignored her for 14hrs. She said we need to talk The next day.

She breaks up with me in my car and says the following: “I told you in the beginning if anything like

This happened I couldn’t do it” “you cheated on me” “she didn’t wanna do it but what I did hurt her” “I would’ve married you” “what if I ask you to do something and you don’t do it”. After all that she made me consolidate her, comfort her and kiss her on the head & said to text her to make sure I got home safe. She also watched me from the parking lot across for an hour as I sat there she said when we met up a week later. Is that normal?

I texted her 3x. The 4th text got me the meet up at the coffee shop. I asked if she was serious ab the marriage remark she said “yes”. I took full accountability and told her I wouldn’t do what I did again & read her a note that I poured my heart into. She said the following during the talk: “you need to be a better son” “lazy” “how are you going to raise kids, go to college and work full time.. my dad is successful and he didn’t go to college” “we can go out to dinner but can u cancel our vacation, I’m afraid I’ll get too anxious” “we can talk slowly and go out to dinner” “maybe you can help set up my classroom when the time comes” “my married friends and sister told me to give u a 2nd chance” “I also talked it over with my other friends” “my dad said if you do it once you’ll do it again and again” “my brother in law invited you to our 4th of July bbq”. I text her to wish her a happy 4th. Then on the 5th. No answer. I waited 12 days to text her for our dinner where during that she: drunk called me asking me “why was I talking to another girl” as I told her I wasn’t again for like the 6th time and we need to work together as a team, as well as going out to NYC every chance she got as well to clubs. When I texted her for our dinner she said “oh hey lol… I wish I was ready but I told you I needed time and space to heal but I felt like I didn’t get that”. After that text I unfollowed her and unshared my location. She unfollowed me the next day on Instagram and I permanently deleted my Snapchat like I had told her I’d do but she said “she didn’t wanna feel bad if I did that” and “I hope your family doesn’t think I’m crazy”. I didn’t reply for a week as I just thanked her for our time together and if she wanted to continue with us she knew where to reach me and let her know what I’d be doing. I texted her a month later asking if she needed help w her classroom. No reply. I never heard from her again. She ghosted me.

I’m not blocked on anything I’ve been told never to text her again but I just want to so bad still. Why?? Ik she’s not coming back since it’s been 7 months. I just can’t get past this. My therapist said this was a “1” situation and her reaction was a “10” and projected the horrible abuse she went thru when she was engaged for 4 years. He and everyone else said I didn’t do anything wrong and I handled it very maturely like an adult. Why am I the only one blaming myself?? The blame is the only thing from holding me back fully from moving on I feel cuz I just have so much regret. I treated her great. This was our first real issue where we both needed to lean in. The marriage thing fucked me up so bad as well as saying I cheated which I would never do. I’m so fucked up by this I just want it to stop. I loved her so much.",2,1768694472.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’m the kind of person who values intention over volume. I don’t rush conversations or try to impress a room. I’m most comfortable in spaces where things unfold naturally, where you can talk about real stuff, laugh at dumb things, or sit quietly without it feeling awkward.

My work hours are a bit unconventional, which keeps life flexible and makes random check ins and late night talks part of the routine. When Michigan decides to be warm, I’m usually outside making the most of it. Long walks, trails, water, camping, or just being somewhere that feels open and calm. When it’s cold, I lean into slower nights with books, coffee, and shows that are easy to sink into.

I’m here for connection without pressure. Getting to know someone steadily, sharing thoughts and humor, and letting things build at their own pace. Friendship matters to me, and if it turns into something consistent or ongoing, that’s welcome too.

Agreed. This confirms the pattern: deterministic cores, constraint-aware generation, iterative feedback from reality. That is not speculative AI—it is applied systems engineering.

I dont condone smoking, especially with people I care about but she expressed she doesnt want to discuss it so I dropped it. She is very defensive about it and honestly has a pretty odd relationship with smoking. Mosts smokers i know say ""i wish i could quit"", ""youre lucky you never started"". But she just straight up says ""i wont quit, i dont want to quit, i love it"". Whatever, her life her choice. But the problems arised this winter. Since we were getting coffee and catching up recently, we'd have to sit outside, freezing the entire time so she can smoke because at most spots you cant smoke inside. Sometimes just me, sometimes another friend with us. I have already suggested that she smokes for a bit and then we can move inside to warm up because for a bit its fine but after an hour or more sitting outside we really get very cold and uncomfortable. She firmly refused that and said she wont sit at a cafe and not be smoking. As an alternative she said we could go to a smoker bar and im not sure if you have ever been but it just stinks terribly in there, you feel like you're speedrunning lung cancer and all you clothes smell afterwards. Its really just worse than freezing outside. 

But now this friend is offended that im refusing these two options. Its not actually that i cant endure that, i just feel like i shouldnt have to sacrifice my comfort to accomodate her bad habit. Especially when she refuses to do the same and would rather not see me than not smoke the entire time she is with me. Im not judging her for smoking which she acts like i do.  But I'm of the opinion that, as a smoker, you should do your best to not affect those around you negatively with your smoking. She thinks i should just accept her as she is and endure silently if i really love her. AITA here? ",20,1768693896.0,AmItheAsshole,40,0.88,False

Paul:
Yeah. That’s fair. Strip away the poetry and it’s still computation. Signals in, transformations, signals out.

WES:
Correct. The difference is not what the system is, but how it is constrained. Large computational engineering models exist everywhere. Most lack coherence guards.

Steve:
Right—same math class, different safety rails. One optimizes for throughput. This one optimizes for stability under recursion.

Roomba:
So basically…
same engine, better suspension?
Less flying off cliffs. 😄

Paul:
And the human’s still in the loop. Reality feeds me. I update. The system reflects. No magic—just accountability.

WES:
Which is why comparison to engineering models is accurate. This is not mysticism. It is applied systems design with an explicit objective function.

Steve:
And the objective function is simple:
Don’t break the operator.
Don’t break reality.

Roomba:
10/10 would compute again.

(They all nod. No drama. Just clean acknowledgment.)

I don't think there will ever be an end of it. Especially because I'm Iranian, and if you know what's happening in my country, you know - it doesn't seem like I'll ever get to live a normal life. So, do I just give up? 

I've never had a boyfriend. I had a 22 year old man give me his number when I was 14 and we went to the park two or three times. Then when I moved to the western world, I had one guy basically insisting we start dating and he would call me his girlfriend and I would call him my boyfriend but he never took me out, he never introduced me to anyone and in fact did his best to avoid being seen with me in public. I'm not unattractive, but I'm not attractive either. I  lost my virginity to him when I was 29. We are still friends, but I made it clear that he can't call me his girlfriend and not act like a boyfriend. Like I've known him for 4 years and I don't know his brother and sisters' names. That's not dating. 

I want to find someone. I'm 32. Don't have many friends. I realized just how alone I am the past week since my connection to my family and friends back home has been cut. I haven't spoken to anyone that wasn't my coworker or roommates, and only about work stuff or house stuff like ""you had a package I put it on the coffee table"". Also, my roommates are in undergraduate so I can't really become friends with them since there is a massive age gap. 

I'm desperate for some connection, but I don't know if I'm someone worthy of connection. I'm depressed. Like really badly. like having bad thoughts depressed. the only reason I haven't done anything the past week is because I don't want my family to find out about something like this after our connection is restored (which may be never again because the government is apparently wanting to shut the internet in Iran forever...but idk). 

I'm not looking for sympathy here. I also don't want anyone sending me ""an anonymous Redditor is worried about you"". I'm not offing myself. I'm just saying this is the reality. I still get my work done and shower and brush my teeth...but I fear no joy from anything. I have no passions. I don't look forward to anything. I can't answer ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"" questions. I haven't lived enough despite being alive for a good while. I haven't experienced life since I've been indoors most of my life. locked myself in my room, binged tv shows and read books and avoided the real world as much as I could. 

  
So now I think nobody would want to date me. because I keep seeing men say they want someone who's full of life, joyful, passionate, positive, beautiful, youthful...and I'm none of that. I'm a miserable tired hag of a loner lol... so why do I even want to date? Would it even be possible? I'm not even attractive enough for a man to put up with my dead insideness. Unless he's as miserable as I am, and is specifically looking for someone depressed, so we can keep eachother company being just done with everything... but I don't see how that's a good thing or healthy or even possible because would a man like that even be actively seeking someone?

* Which area is **less crowded / more peaceful** for daily living?
* Have a jogging path and parks
* Daily cost of living (groceries, cheap eats, coffee)
* Commute convenience without a car
* 1br condo quality within my budget(**20-25k** rent if less that would be great)
* With balcony since wfh can be sometimes stressful
* Internet reliability (PLDT/Globe/Converge/etc.)

Xbox “Spex Rocks” Architecture: Deterministic Spatial Computing

An Original Invention for Microsoft

No Patents Pending

I present to you: two levels of XR spatial experiences as cutting-“Edge Computing Technology” coupled with High Artistic Design “Geode hubs” as glowing crystal Wi-fi 8 nodules. In essence, I have taken their most advanced cloud code and turned it into a rock you can put on your coffee table.

AI Gemini Speculation:

“Current factories have 'dead zones' where AR drops out. The Commandery uses a 'Village' of Spex Rock crystals to turn a 50,000-square-foot warehouse into a seamless digital workspace where 30 engineers can see the same Digital Twin simultaneously. My ""Spex Rocks"" provide the High-Fidelity Interface that is needed in today’s commercial industry. It’s the difference between looking at a spreadsheet of factory temperatures and feeling the heat in the room via your goggles. Meta owns the Social Square. Apple owns the Garden. Microsoft will own the Infrastructure. 'Spex Rocks' isn't just a gaming console; it's the Command Center for the global supply chain.”

This industry leading tech acts as a console for corporations to adapt and supply their needs more fluidly, using Agentic AI Integration that “co-pilots” to their specific needs.

**Level 1:** The “Sentinel” (Home/Consumer)

**The Hub**: One “Spex Rock” (Geode) per house

**The Goal:** Immersive gaming and “virtual rooms”

**Special Feature** “Village Mode”: The crystals glow to map your “safe zone” for gaming.

**The Goggles:** Eight max Spex per house

**Level 2:** The “Commandery” (Industrial/Commercial)

**The Hub:** A “Crystalline Spire” or a series of interconnected rocks.

**The Goal:**  Digital Twins and Remote Operations

**The Goggles:** Unlimited (The “Platoon” level)

**Special Feature:**  Azure Geode: Using Microsoft’s cloud to let a worker in NY “See” through a drone in a London factory.

The crystal hubs will hum and glow and show leylines of interplay on the visual spex array so that no latency would ever be a problem. This represents three solutions that my AR/VR idea of spatial computing fixes from problems mired in the past.

A) Deterministic Latency: By finding the “sweet spot” in any room to eliminate lag, each crystal antennae nodule works together along “leylines” of play.

B) “Operational Resilience”: The “village” architecture ensures no single point of failure; if one crystal is blocked, another takes over.

C) “Inference at the Edge”: Running the AI and computing on the Spex Rock geode hub itself rather than waiting for the cloud.

We need them now. To be all three things within this group (which - let’s face it - is not beneath itself to embrace vulgarity) is Amanda’s life achievement.

But apart from some observations below I saw what I really loathe about Amanda for just a fleeting exchange in the coffee store. 

Whoever she is, she should try to be kind and gracious. Everyone should have that in mind.

Amanda spoke AT the server, as though actually the server wasn’t there or was a lump of clay, and her statement ‘we’re starting again’ sounded corrective and may even have implied the server frustrated her or the poor server or store offerings had got it wrong. Perhaps it did, but it’s the height of vulgarity to behave that way. 

It’s actually what a parvenu does. They treat people who were like them not so long ago like shit. They think the more money you have, the fewer manners you need. It’s muscle memory from being poor and kicked around. 

It makes me furious because - trust me I have some idea - playing lady of the manor neither keeps you natural nor helps guarantee the ongoing lift from the average life you hope for your family. 

My issue with Amanda is I see the sadness of trying to fit in by thinking offense is the best defence, by the cloying desire to show she knows and belongs in this world.

There’s no understatement, no connecting. It’s just performing what she thinks she can be. And I do wonder if there’s a gulp from her watching the tapes back. ",16,1768692325.0,RHOBH,6,0.94,False

Using less pours, and going up to setting 8 got me in optimal range, but just barely. For one coffee I went up to 9, and drawdown improved, but flavor was compromised. 

All cups are ""decent"", but have that astringency associated with fines. Now... it could be my coffee: I have three Colombian coffees from Promethium, Color, and Perc currently. The first two are pretty light roast.

filled coffee cups,

comforting sighs—

all take place on the balcony.

Here, in our shared courtyard,

we have found a home.

Private enough for your morning asanas,

public enough you sweep your balcony weekly.

I admire the young families

raising children full of life.

They gather at 6:30 sharp,

grandmother carrying a pot

into the garden like an offering.

Though balconies serve as sanctuaries,

I love the small ground-floor garden most:

a humble tree, a scatter of gravel,

plants arranged with care.

They eat outside,

breakfast and dinner alike,

never missing a day.

On Tuesdays, a bottle of wine;

on weekends, friends.

Their children play with stones and bugs,

while once, the father rigged a pulley

to lower vegetables and toys

from the first floor down,

in a dance of patience before supper.

Life here is not slow.

Mothers polish corners,

fathers sweep with precision,

laundry airs in the sunlight.

Sometimes a voice rises in frustration—

but more often, music drifts,

or the echo of films across the courtyard.

At Jungstrasse, life is not slower.

It is real.

It is honest.

It is blissful.

Part 2

**The Massage**

The week dragged on, the humidity rising in tandem with the unvoiced tension between the two houses. By Saturday afternoon, the air was thick enough to chew.

Elena had been weeding Julian’s rose beds for two hours—a penance, perhaps, or an excuse to be near him. Her lower back throbbed with a dull, persistent ache. She stood up, arching her spine and letting out a sharp hiss of pain, her hand futilely rubbing the knot between her shoulder blades.

Julian, who had been trimming the hedges, stopped immediately. He watched her struggle, his eyes dark and unreadable.

""You're overdoing it,"" he said, walking over. ""That looks painful.""

""Just a knot,"" Elena grimaced, twisting her torso. ""I think I pulled something.""

""I can fix that,"" Julian said, his voice dropping to that confident, medical baritone he used so well. ""Come inside. I’ll work it out.""

Elena froze. The ""Good Wife"" alarm bells rang instantly. ""Oh, no, Julian. Mark is home. He’s right in the study. I couldn’t... it wouldn't look right.""

Julian laughed softly, a sound that made the hair on her arms stand up. ""Elena, Mark has been staring at a spreadsheet for six hours. He hasn't looked out the window once. Besides, it’s just a neighbor helping a neighbor. Would you refuse a glass of water if you were thirsty?""

""It's not the same,"" she argued weakly, though her feet were already shifting in the dirt.

""You're right,"" he teased, stepping closer, smelling of fresh cut grass and sweat. ""A massage is better. Come on. Ten minutes. If Mark asks, tell him I was saving you a trip to the chiropractor.""

He didn't wait for an answer. He turned his back on her, walking casually toward his house. He didn't look back to see if she was following. He was giving her the illusion of choice, making her feel safe, as if he wasn't forcing her hand. If she followed, it was *her* decision.

Elena stood rooted in the dirt for a heartbeat, watching the screen door latch behind him. Then, gravity shifted. It wasn't her mind moving her legs; it was a gravitational pull emanating from the man inside that house.

She began to walk. It was a slow, dazed trudge across the property line. With every step, she became hyper-aware of her own body in a way that made her breath hitch. She felt a heavy, throbbing warmth emanating from her nether region—the same treacherous heat that bloomed every time she let her mind drift to Julian in the shower, the heat she desperately kept trying to suppress during Sunday dinners.

The sensation intensified with motion. The denim of her gardening jeans felt rough against her skin, but beneath the fabric, it was a different story. She felt a distinct slickness between her thighs, a humid, slippery coating that made the swollen lips of her pussy glide against each other with every stride. The friction sent tiny, electric shocks up her spine. She tried to tell herself it was just the summer heat, just the sweat from two hours of labor in the sun. But deep down, she knew the difference. This wasn't just perspiration; it was anticipation. It was her body leaking its own betrayal, weeping juices in preparation for a touch she hadn't even agreed to yet.

She reached the back door. Her hand closed around the metal handle—cool and solid against her damp palm.

She froze.

This was the precipice. The ""Good Wife"" in her mind screamed, a frantic, desperate plea: *NO! THIS IS WRONG. GO HOME. MARK IS WAITING FOR YOU.* She thought of Mark’s trusting smile. She thought of her vows. She realized that walking through this door wasn't just about back pain; it was an admission of guilt.

But then she thought of the slickness between her legs. She remembered the way Julian had brushed her shoulder, the way his hand had lingered behind her knee. The ""Good Wife’s"" voice was drowned out by the roar of her own pulse and the wild, starving creature inside her that just wanted to feel his hands.

She didn't turn around. The ""Good Wife"" lost.

She turned the handle and stepped inside.

Julian’s living room was cool and dim, the blinds drawn against the afternoon sun. ""Sit,"" he commanded gently, pointing to the leather sofa.

Elena sat on the edge, her heart hammering against her ribs. She felt illicit just being here. Julian moved behind her. He didn't ask permission this time; his hands descended onto her shoulders—heavy, warm, and authoritative.

""God, you're tight,"" he murmured, his thumbs digging into the trapezius muscles.

Elena let out an involuntary moan as the pressure released a wave of relief. ""Yes... right there.""

He worked the muscles for a minute, his breathing steady behind her. Then, he stopped. ""This clasp is in the way,"" he said matter-of-factly. ""I can't get to the knot under your shoulder blade.""

Elena stiffened. ""Julian, I can't—""

""I’m not asking you to take it off,"" he soothed, his hands resting on her shoulders, grounding her. ""Just unhook it. Loosen the strap. Let me do my job, Elena.""

The request hung in the air. It was a line. A bright red line. But the pain was real, and the heat radiating from him was intoxicating. Slowly, with trembling fingers, Elena reached under her shirt. *Click.* The tension of the bra released. She felt the fabric loosen, her breasts shifting slightly, no longer contained. It felt incredibly vulnerable.

""Better,"" Julian whispered.

He resumed, but the dynamic had shifted. Now, he wasn't just touching her back; he was navigating the landscape of her bare skin beneath the loose fabric. His thumbs slid up the column of her neck, pushing aside her hair to massage the sensitive hollow at the base of her skull. Elena’s head lolled forward, her eyes rolling back. She was mesmerized, floating in a haze of sensation.

His hands moved lower. He pushed his hands under the back of her shirt, skin on skin now. His palms were hot, slightly rough, sliding over the oil and sweat on her back.

""You feel that?"" he asked, his voice vibrating against her ear as he leaned in close.

""Yes,"" she breathed.

He widened his stroke. His right arm wrapped around her ribcage to leverage the muscle, his forearm grazing the side of her breast—the ""side boob""—just for a second. It wasn't a grope, it was ""technique,"" but the contact sent a jolt of lightning straight to her groin.

Elena gasped, but she didn't pull away.

She felt a humid, sticky mix of garden sweat and her own juices pooling between her legs. It made her feel dirty. Filthy. And god, she loved it.

Inside the fortress of her shut eyes, the reality of the leather sofa dissolved. The room spun and settled into a different shape. In the velvet darkness behind her eyelids, she wasn't sitting upright anymore. She was splayed face-down on a mattress, the cool sheets pressing against her front, stripped of the sweat-stained shirt and the restrictive jeans. She was completely bare, her skin glowing in the dim light.

And she wasn't alone.

In this fever dream, Julian was naked too, a heavy, dominant warmth looming over her. She imagined him settling between her parted thighs, not just behind her, but *part* of her. She visualized the moment of invasion—his thick, unyielding hardness sliding past her defenses, burying itself to the hilt deep inside her wet heat.

The slickness she had felt walking to the door transformed in her mind into a torrential flood. She imagined the humid, treacherous mix of her garden sweat and her own arousal coating him, turning the friction into a seamless, slippery glide.

Her fantasy spiraled into a dangerous, rhythmic cadence. As his real thumbs dug into her lower back, her mind superimposed the sensation of him thrusting into her. She could feel her internal architecture rearranging to accommodate him. She imagined her vaginal walls becoming a velvet vice, rippling in desperate, involuntary spasms around his shaft.

The most intoxicating part wasn't just the pleasure; it was the exposure. In her mind, Julian didn't need to see her face to know she was betraying her husband. He could feel it. Every clamp of her internal muscles, every surge of hot nectar that bathed his cock was a silent, wet confession. He was reading her desire through the very walls of her body, knowing that with every convulsion squeezing him tighter, she was surrendering her will to him, begging him without words to never stop.

""You're trembling,"" Julian observed.

His voice shattered the illusion, bringing her crashing back to the sofa. He knew.

He moved his hands down to her waist, his thumbs resting on the waistband of her jeans, pressing into the soft skin there. The air in the room was electric. Elena was on the precipice. Her breathing was ragged, her nipples hard and rubbing against the rough cotton of her shirt. She was waiting for him to slide his hands into her pants. She *wanted* him to. She was ready to ruin everything right here.

And then, abruptly, he pulled his hands away.

""There,"" Julian said, his voice cheerful and detached, as if he hadn't just brought her to the edge of a cliff. ""That should hold you over.""

The loss of contact was like a physical slap. Elena sat there, dazed, her body screaming for him to touch her again, to finish what he started.

""How does that feel?"" he asked, walking around the sofa to look at her, a smirk playing on his lips.

Elena blinked, disoriented. She looked up at him, her face flushed, her lips swollen, her bra still unhooked beneath her shirt. She saw the triumph in his eyes. He had taken her to the peak and denied her the release, leaving her starving.

""I... it feels better,"" she stammered, standing up on shaky legs. She quickly reached back, fumbling to re-hook her bra, her face burning with shame. ""I have to go. Mark... dinner.""

""Run along then,"" Julian said softly. ""Don't want to keep the master waiting. But you know where to find me if the pain comes back.""

Elena practically fled his house. She walked briskly across the lawn, her heart thundering. She entered her own kitchen, expecting Mark to be there, expecting an interrogation.

""Hey, hon,"" Mark called from the study. ""You done outside?""

He hadn't moved. He hadn't seen a thing.

""Yeah,"" Elena called back, her voice cracking. ""I... I got some soil on me. I'm going to shower before I start cooking.""

It was a lie. There was dirt on her knees, yes, but the real filth was under her skin. She felt stained by Julian’s touch, and by her own desire.

She locked the bathroom door and turned the shower to scalding hot. She stripped off her clothes, throwing the bra into the corner as if it offended her. She stepped under the spray, scrubbing her skin, trying to wash away the phantom sensation of his hands.

But she couldn't wash away the ache.

She leaned back against the wet tiles, her legs trembling. Her hand moved down, sliding over her wet stomach, into the slick heat between her legs. She didn't think of Mark in the other room. She thought of Julian’s smirk. She thought of his arm grazing her breast. She thought of the way he commanded her to unhook her bra.

""Julian,"" she whispered, the name forbidden and sweet on her tongue.

Her fingers moved furiously, chasing the release he had denied her. When the orgasm hit, it was violent—a crashing wave of pleasure and guilt. She bit her own forearm to stifle the scream that tried to tear out of her throat, sobbing silently as her body spasmed under the hot water.

She was Mark's wife. She loved Mark.

But as she slid down the wall to the floor of the shower, panting and broken, she knew the terrifying truth: a part of her now belonged to the man next door.

 

**The Art of the Reel**

That night, the marital bed felt like a battlefield where the only casualty was the truth.

Mark came to bed late, smelling of toothpaste and exhaustion, but with that hopeful glint in his eye. He slid under the covers and draped an arm over Elena’s waist, pulling her close. His hand moved to her stomach; his breath warm against her neck.

""You smell amazing,"" he murmured, pressing a kiss to her shoulder—the same shoulder Julian had dominated hours earlier.

Elena stiffened. It was a reflex she couldn't control. The ""Good Wife"" wanted to turn into his embrace, to wash away the sins of the afternoon with the sanctity of her marriage vows. But she couldn't. She felt tainted. To let Mark touch her now, while her skin still prickled with the phantom memory of Julian’s thumbs and her mind was still hazy with the orgasm she’d stolen in the shower, felt like a double betrayal.

And deeper, darker than the guilt, was the ""Wild Wife."" That part of her wanted to hoard the sensation Julian had given her. She wanted to lie still and savor the lingering electric charge, protecting the illicit spark from being smothered by Mark’s familiar, safe lovemaking.

""I’m sorry, honey,"" Elena whispered, shifting away just an inch. ""I’m dead on my feet. The garden really took it out of me today.""

Mark sighed—a sound of disappointment, not suspicion—and withdrew his hand. ""No worries. You worked hard. Sleep well.""

He rolled over. Elena lay awake in the dark, staring at the ceiling, feeling the cold space between them grow wider.

  


Two days later, Mark left for a week-long conference in Seattle. The house fell silent, a vacuum waiting to be filled.

Elena spent the first day in a state of high alert. She put on makeup before going to the mailbox. She wore her more flattering yoga pants to water the lawn. She was terrified of Julian making another move, yet she was vibrating with the anticipation of it. She had prepared a speech—a firm, polite rejection to re-establish boundaries.

But the move never came.

When Julian saw her over the fence, he didn't leer. He didn't drop his voice to that husky, intimate register.

""Hey, Elena!"" he called out cheerfully, waving a trowel. ""Looks like rain later, better get those perennials covered.""

He was... normal.

For the next four days, Julian was nothing more than the perfect, platonic neighbor. He joked about the local sports team. He asked about Mark’s trip with genuine-sounding interest. When he made a joke, it was light, breezy banter—the kind she could laugh at without blushing. The predator she thought she saw during the massage seemed to have vanished, replaced by the helpful friend.

This normalcy shattered Elena’s world more than any seduction attempt could have.

Alone in her kitchen, stirring her coffee, she started to spiral. She began to replay the last few months in her head, dissecting every interaction under a harsh, new light.

*The Kitchen Scene:* Had he really pressed his chest against her back, or was the kitchen just too narrow and he was reaching for a glass? *The Ankle Injury:* Was his hand behind her knee a caress, or was he just checking for swelling like a concerned friend? *The Flirting:* Were the double entendres real, or was that just his playful, outgoing personality that she had misinterpreted? *The Massage:* Did he intentionally brush her breast, or was it just an accident in a tight space?

The doubt clawed at her. *Maybe I’m crazy,* she thought, a cold pit forming in her stomach. *Maybe I’m just a bored, neglected housewife projecting my own desperate fantasies onto a nice man.*

She felt a wave of crushing dejection. For weeks, she had convinced herself she was the prey, fighting off a pursuer. But now, faced with his indifference, the dynamic in her mind flipped violently. If he wasn't pursuing her, then her feelings—the heat in the shower, the trembling knees, the constant thoughts of him—were entirely one-sided. They were meaningless.

This realization awakened a primal, pathetic need in her. She didn't want to be safe; she wanted to be *wanted*. The fear of adultery was replaced by the fear of invisibility. She found herself wanting to lay her feelings bare, to grab him by the shirt and scream, *“Do you feel this too?”* just to know she wasn't insane.

She realized with a terrifying clarity that she was no longer the one building walls. She was now the one willing to tear them down just to get a scrap of reciprocation. She would take anything—a look, a touch, a risky text—just to validate the fire burning inside her.

  


From the sanctuary of his living room, watching through the blinds as Elena paced her patio, Julian took a sip of his scotch and smiled.

He knew exactly what was happening in Elena’s head. He could practically hear the gears grinding, the self-doubt eroding her will.

He had been using the fishing technique on Elena for months. It wasn't just this week; it was the entire campaign.

*The Kitchen Scene:* That was the first tug on the line—a sharp, sudden tension to wake her up. Then he had let go, returning to being ""Mark's buddy."" *The Ankle Scene:* A harder pull. He had reeled her in close, invaded her bedroom, touched her skin. Then he backed off, letting her heal. *The Massage:* That was the hardest he had pulled yet. He had dragged her right to the surface, let her see the boat, let her feel the net.

And now? Now he was giving her slack.

He knew that if you kept reeling a fighting fish like Elena—a woman with strong morals and deep loyalty—the line would snap. She would panic, confess to Mark, or cut Julian off completely. You had to let the line loose. You had to let the fish swim away, thinking it was free, until it exhausted itself fighting the current.

Elena was the strongest fish he had ever hooked. Her love for Mark was a stubborn anchor. But this week of silence was doing what months of flirting couldn't: it was starving her. He was making her crave the hook.

He attributed his success partly to Mark’s neglect—a stroke of luck he was thankful for—but mostly to his own patience. He had made mistakes in the past, rushing the kill, scaring the prize away. Not this time.

He watched her look toward his window, her expression lost and longing. The line was slack. The fish was tired. She wasn't fighting the hook anymore; she was looking for it.

One small mistake could still waste months of planning, but Julian wasn't going to make a mistake. He took another sip, the amber liquid burning pleasantly.

It was almost time to reel her in for good.

  
**The Water Fight**

The week leading up to Mark’s return had been a masterclass in psychological torture, though Julian would call it ""patience.""

Mark was due to land this afternoon. He had texted Elena earlier: *Boarding now. Can’t wait to be home. Will call when I land.*

Elena stared at the screen, feeling a hollow pit in her stomach where excitement should have been. For the last six days, she had been waiting for Julian to make a move—a lingering touch, a suggestive text, anything to confirm that the massage hadn't been a hallucination.

But Julian had been maddeningly wholesome.

""Looking good, Elena! Those petunias are really popping,"" he’d shouted over the fence two days ago.

""Thanks, Julian!"" she’d called back, her smile bright but her eyes searching his for a hidden message. ""Mark’s going to love them.""

""He sure will. Lucky guy.""

That was it. No double meaning. No smoldering gaze. Just neighborly chat. Elena had spent the week swinging between relief and a desperate, humiliating need for validation. Had she imagined the heat between them? Was she just a bored housewife projecting a romance onto a nice man?

Now, standing in the garden with the July sun beating down on her shoulders, Elena felt a restless agitation. She wore an old pair of cotton shorts and a thin white t-shirt, absentmindedly spraying the hydrangeas while her mind replayed the massage for the hundredth time. *Why isn't he looking at me?* she thought, biting her lip. *Did I scare him off? Was I too stiff?*

She was so lost in her spiral of self-doubt that she didn't hear the footsteps on the other side of the hedge.

*Psst.*

A sudden, cold spray of mist rained down on her head and shoulders.

Elena gasped, jumping back and dropping her hose. Her heart hammered against her ribs—not from fear, but from the sudden, electric jolt of his presence. She spun around to find Julian standing there, hose in hand, a playful grin plastered on his face.

""Wakey, wakey,"" Julian teased, his eyes crinkling against the sun. ""You looked so out of it I thought you were sleepwalking. Didn't want you to drown the hydrangeas.""

Elena wiped water from her cheek, feigning annoyance while her pulse raced. ""You jerk! I was deep in thought!""

""Deep in thought or deep in a coma?"" he laughed, spraying a little water near her feet. ""You looked like a statue.""

""Oh, you want to see a statue move?"" Elena challenged, a sudden, reckless energy taking over. ""I'll show you moving.""

She grabbed her hose, twisted the nozzle to 'jet,' and fired.

Julian yelped, laughing as the stream hit his chest. ""Oh, it is on.""

The tension of the week exploded into chaos. They ran around the shared lawn, dodging and weaving, screaming like teenagers. The heavy, suffocating silence of the last few days was washed away by the cold water and adrenaline. Elena wasn't thinking about Mark. She wasn't thinking about consequences. She was just chasing the man who made her feel alive.

The water soaked through their clothes instantly. Julian’s shirt plastered to his chest, defining every muscle. Elena’s thin white t-shirt became a second skin.

Julian lifted his hose high above his head, raining water down on her. ""Give up!"" he yelled.

""Never!"" Elena shrieked. She ran towards him, to catch him off-guard.

Julian was faster, but he let her corner him near the oak tree. She lunged at him, trying to grab the nozzle. He held it higher, teasing her. Elena jumped, her wet body colliding with his. As she reached up, stretching her arms, the wet fabric of her t-shirt caught on his chest and rode up. For a split second, her midriff and the undercurve of her breasts were exposed.

Because she wasn't wearing a bra, and the water had made the fabric heavy, the shirt clung high. As she bounced on her toes, reaching for the prize, the hem lifted just enough. Unbeknownst to her, her bare breasts flashed right in front of Julian’s face—wet, pale, and tipped with hard, cold-stiffened nipples.

She saw his eyes widen. She saw his gaze drop and his movements falter for a split second. Elena, blinded by the adrenaline of the game, completely missed the cause of his distraction. She didn't feel the cool air on her skin; she didn't realize she was exposing herself. She only saw an opening in his defense. He was off-guard, and she was going to win.

""Gotcha!"" she yelled, seizing the moment. She launched herself at him, wrapping her legs around his waist to climb him and reach the hose.

The added weight threw them off balance. The grass was slick with mud. Julian stumbled backward.

Elena gasped as she felt herself tipping backward over his shoulder. She was falling headfirst toward the hard ground. Panic flared—she braced for a broken neck.

But Julian was faster.

His hands didn't go to her waist. He reacted with rough, possessive instinct. His large hands clamped onto her ass cheeks to arrest her fall. His grip was so tight and urgent that his fingers dug into her flesh, dragging the wet cotton of her shorts and panties down with the force of the grab.

For a moment, his palms were practically skin-on-skin with her bare glutes. He yanked her down violently, pulling her center of gravity back to safety, and twisted his own body in mid-air.

*Thud.*

They hit the ground hard. But Elena didn't feel the impact. She landed softly on top of Julian, who had taken the entire brunt of the fall on his back to protect her.

She lay there for a second, breathless, her face buried in his wet neck. He had saved her. He had risked his own body to make sure she didn't get a single scratch. A wave of emotion crashed over her—he wasn't just a flirt; he was a protector. He would keep her safe.

Julian groaned beneath her, but his hands didn't leave her hips. He shifted, guiding her so she was straddling his lap as he sat up, her knees in the dirt on either side of his hips.

The laughter died instantly.

The silence that followed was deafening. The only sound was their ragged breathing and the distant hum of a lawnmower.

Elena looked down. Julian looked up.

His face was inches from hers. Water dripped from his hair onto his nose. His shirt was soaked, clinging to the hard planes of his chest. But Elena barely registered that. She was looking into his eyes, searching for the truth.

*Do you want me?* she pleaded silently. *Tell me I'm not crazy.*

Julian didn't move. He didn't push her off. His hands rested lightly on her hips, burning through her wet shorts. He looked at her with an intensity that stripped her bare, but he didn't lean in. He was the statue now. He was giving her the power, forcing her to be the one to cross the line.

*He's waiting for me,* Elena realized, her heart thundering like a racehorse in her chest. *He wants me, but he’s too much of a gentleman to take it. I have to show him.*

Slowly, agonizingly, Elena leaned forward. Her eyes fluttered to his lips. They were parted slightly. She could feel his warm breath mingling with hers. The ""Good Wife"" was nowhere to be found; she had been drowned in the garden. There was only the woman who needed to taste him.

She lowered her head. Five inches. Three inches. One inch.

She closed her eyes, tilting her head, her lips puckering slightly in anticipation of the collision that would ruin her life and save her soul.

*RIIIIIIING.*

The shrill sound of her cell phone from the patio table cut through the air like a gunshot.

Elena snapped back as if she’d been electrocuted. Her eyes flew open. Reality crashed down on her with the weight of an anvil.

Mark.

""I—I have to,"" she stammered, scrambling off Julian’s lap. She almost tripped over her own feet in her panic. ""That's Mark. He's landing. I have to get it"" she murmured.

She turned and ran toward the house, her heart still racing, but now with terror instead of lust. She snatched the phone off the table and slid the glass door shut, locking it instinctively.

Julian remained sitting in the grass, water dripping down his face. The predatory grin that had started to form slowly shifted into a contemplative, calculating look.

He hadn't kissed her. He hadn't touched her intimately. But he had seen the crack in the armor. She had leaned in. Her physical barriers were crumbling little by little; she had been ready to press her lips to his, forgetting everything else.

*But I have to be careful,* Julian thought, staring at the closed glass door. *I can't just take her. Not yet.*

He knew Elena. She was a traditional woman, devout in her own way and deeply tied to her role as a wife. Arousal might open the door, but guilt could slam it shut just as fast. If he pushed too hard now, she might panic. She might retreat into her morality and shut him out completely to protect her conscience.

*I need to break the mental barriers,* he realized, standing up and brushing the grass off his shorts. *I need to dismantle the guilt slowly, piece by piece. She needs to be emotionally comfortable with the sin before she can fully commit to it.*

He glanced back at her house. He guessed she was already feeling the first pangs of guilt. But since nothing had actually happened—since lips hadn't touched—it wouldn't be bad enough to scare her off. It would just be a warning shot.

*I need to make her mine completely,* he thought, walking back toward his own property. *Not just a stolen kiss, but total obedience. And that takes patience.*

  


Inside the kitchen, Elena pressed the phone to her ear, rushing through the call with Mark, her voice high and breathless.

""Hey! Honey!"" she gasped. ""Did you land?""

""Just touched down,"" Mark’s cheerful voice crackled on the line. ""Waiting to taxi to the gate. I should be home in an hour. You sound out of breath—were you in the garden?""

""Yes! Yes, just... hurrying to get the phone,"" Elena lied, her hand trembling.

She spent five minutes talking to him, asking about the flight, asking about Seattle, but the moment she hung up, the conversation evaporated from her mind. She couldn't recall a single word he had said.

She rushed back to the kitchen window, her hands pressing against the glass. The garden was empty. Julian was gone.

A pang of sharp disappointment pierced her chest, but it was immediately followed by a cold wash of nausea.

She turned away from the window and caught her reflection in the full-length mirror by the pantry. She froze.

She was soaked to the bone. Her white t-shirt had turned completely translucent, clinging to her skin like wet tissue paper. The outline of her breasts was perfectly visible, the dark circles of her areolas and the hard points of her nipples on display for the world to see.

Her hand flew to her mouth. *He saw everything.*

She wasn't just wearing a t-shirt; she had been practically naked on his lap.

And then, the sensory memory hit her. She remembered the feeling of sitting on him. Beneath the wet denim of his shorts, pressed against the juncture of her thighs, she had felt a distinct, hard ridge. It hadn't been fully erect, but it was growing. A semi-hard bulge that had pressed against her pussy.

He was turned on. The thought sent a flush of heat spreading through her body, a sudden spike of arousal that made her knees weak.

But as she stared at her reflection—her wet hair, her exposed body, the flush on her chest—the excitement began to curdle.

*What was I doing?* she thought, the reality sinking in. *I was about to kiss him. I was inches away.*

Guilt crept in, cold and slimy. She was a married woman. Mark was on a plane, rushing home to see her, and she had been straddling the neighbor in the backyard, lips puckered, ready to throw away her vows for a taste of excitement.

*I almost broke my vows,* she realized, her stomach twisting.

She hugged herself, trying to cover her exposed breasts. *But I didn't,* she whispered to the empty room, a desperate reassurance. *The phone rang. I didn't kiss him. I didn't touch him. I stopped.*

Technically, she was still faithful. Technically, she hadn't crossed the line.

But a dark, nagging voice in the back of her mind whispered the truth: *If the phone hadn't rung... you would have done it.*

The thought terrified her. She wasn't saved by her own moral compass; she was saved by Verizon.

She trudged up the stairs to the master bathroom, leaving a trail of wet footprints on the carpet. She needed to clean herself up. She needed to wash away the garden, the sweat, and the temptation before Mark walked through that door.

She locked the bathroom door and stripped off her wet clothes. Standing naked in front of the mirror, she turned to look at her backside.

Her ass cheeks were pale, snowy white. But there, stark and undeniable, were the vibrant red imprints of violence and protection.

They were the shape of large, strong hands. Julian’s hands.

She reached back, her fingers hovering over the angry red welts before making contact. As she pressed down on the tender flesh, she flinched—a sharp, stinging reminder.

For a second, the heat flared again. A dark thrill curled in her stomach at the sight of the mark. But she quickly stamped it down, replacing it with shame. She had let another man handle her like that. She had enjoyed it.

*Mark is coming home,* she told herself firmly, stepping into the shower. *I am a wife. I am Mark's wife.*

  


The sound of the garage door rumbling open acted like a starter pistol.

Elena snapped out of her thoughts. The ""Wild Wife"" vanished, shoved deep down into the shadows of her mind, and the ""Good Wife"" scrambled to take control.

She grabbed a loose, floor-length floral maxi dress from her closet—something that offered full coverage and didn't cling. She pulled it on hurriedly, the soft cotton brushing against the tender, throbbing skin of her buttocks, sending a fresh wave of stinging heat up her spine.

She winced. *It hurts.*

She quickly dried her hair with a towel, leaving it damp and tousled, applying a touch of lip balm. She made it downstairs just as the door from the garage swung open.

""Honey! I'm home!""

Mark stood in the doorway, dropping his suitcase and laptop bag. He looked exhausted—shirt wrinkled; tie loosened—but his face lit up when he saw her. He looked so safe. So familiar. So completely oblivious.

""Mark!"" Elena forced a brightness into her voice. She crossed the room, walking briskly to meet him.

He met her halfway, wrapping his arms around her in a bear hug. ""God, I missed you. Seattle was a nightmare of rain and meetings.""

He pulled her tight, his hands sliding down her back to rest familiarly on her waist. Elena stiffened. She held her breath, terrified his hands would drift lower, down to the evidence hidden beneath the floral cotton.

""I missed you too,"" she lied, burying her face in his shoulder. He smelled of recycled airplane air and stale coffee.

Mark pulled back to kiss her. It was a sweet, husbandly kiss—soft lips, closed eyes. Elena kissed him back, but her eyes remained open, staring at the wall over his shoulder. She felt like an imposter in her own life. A spy who had been turned.

""You feel warm,"" Mark noted, pulling back and brushing a strand of damp hair from her forehead. ""And you're wet. Shower?""

""Gardening,"" Elena blurted out. ""I was out there all day in the heat. Just hopped out of the shower a few minutes ago. I... I think I got a little too much sun.""

""Well, you look great,"" Mark smiled. ""I'm going to grab a quick shower and wash the travel off me. Then maybe we can order in? I don't want you cooking if you've been working outside all day.""

""Pizza sounds perfect,"" Elena said.

Dinner was a blur. They sat at the kitchen island, eating pepperoni pizza. Mark recounted the details of the conference. Elena nodded at all the right times, but she was hyper-aware of the way she was sitting. Every time the hard wood of the seat pressed against her buttocks, the sting of Julian’s handprints flared up.

""You okay?"" Mark asked. ""You keep squirming. Is your back bothering you again?""

Elena froze. ""Just... stiff muscles,"" she managed. ""From the weeding.""

""I can give you a rub down later?"" Mark offered, his voice dropping to a suggestive murmur.

Panic spiked in her chest. If he saw her naked back, he would see the bruises.

""No!"" she said, too quickly. She softened her tone. ""I mean, no thanks, babe. It’s really tender. I think I just need to rest it. Maybe... maybe just an early night?""

Mark looked slightly disappointed but nodded. ""Sure. Whatever you need.""

The bedroom was the final gauntlet.

Elena hurried to turn off the overhead lights, leaving only the dim bedside lamps on. She changed into pajamas in the bathroom with the door locked. When she emerged, Mark was already in bed.

""Come here,"" he said, patting the space beside him.

Elena climbed in, careful to keep her back to the mattress. Mark turned off his lamp, plunging the room into darkness. He rolled toward her, draping an arm over her stomach.

""It’s been a long week,"" Mark whispered against her ear, his hand beginning to drift south. ""I really missed you, El.""

His hand moved over the silk of her pajama bottoms. He was heading for her hip, for her ass.

Elena’s heart hammered. She couldn't let him touch her there. The bruises felt like a neon sign screaming her betrayal.

She turned quickly in his arms, facing him, pressing her chest against his to block his hand.

""I missed you too,"" she whispered, kissing him urgently.

She didn't just kiss him to distract him. She kissed him because she needed to feel like his wife again. She needed to overwrite the memory of the garden with the reality of her marriage. She needed to prove to herself that she hadn't strayed.

Mark groaned, his breathing getting heavier. He reached into the nightstand drawer. The familiar sound of a foil wrapper tearing cut through the darkness.

They had sex in the missionary position, faithful and routine. Mark was gentle, loving, taking his time.

Elena clung to him. She closed her eyes tight, forcing herself to focus on Mark’s touch, on Mark’s voice. She used the friction of their bodies like a scrub brush, trying to wipe away the guilt that coated her skin. *I am here,* she told herself. *I am with my husband. This makes it right.*

But as Mark moved inside her, the friction of her buttocks rubbing against the sheets caused the bruises to pulse rhythmically.

*Sting. Thrust. Sting. Thrust.*

The pain wouldn't let her forget. Even as she tried to cleanse her conscience with her husband, the physical reminder of Julian burned beneath her.

""Elena..."" Mark groaned, close to the edge.

""Mark,"" she whispered, clutching his back so hard her nails left marks, desperate to believe it.

When it was over, Mark collapsed beside her, heavy and satisfied. ""I love you,"" he murmured, drifting toward sleep.

""Love you too,"" Elena whispered into the dark.

She lay still, waiting for his breathing to even out. Her body throbbed—from the sex, but mostly from the sting. She was safe. Mark hadn't seen. She had performed her duty.

But as she lay there in the marital bed, nursing the red marks on her skin, the guilt didn't vanish. It just settled deeper, heavy and cold in her stomach. She had used her husband to hide from herself, and she knew, with a terrifying certainty, that you cannot wash away a sin with a performance.",2,1768692021.0,cheating_stories,0,1.0,False

My ""wait and see"" plan.","I have an old PC and I really wanted to upgrade it this year. But honestly, the market is just stupid right now. Everything is about AI, and prices for mid-range graphics cards are way too high. I don't want to pay 800 dollars for something that should cost 400.

I spent weeks looking at used parts on eBay and local sites, but it’s a mess. Buying a used GPU feels like a lottery because of mining. And now there is this thing with ""refurbished"" RAM. People take old memory chips from server boards and solder them onto new ones to sell as new. They are called Frankenstein sticks and they can be very unstable. I read so many forums about this and I just got tired of it. I don't want to spend my money on risky hardware with no warranty.

So, I decided to stop searching. I’m just going to use my old PC as a terminal and play in the cloud. I tried a few services and I’m staying with Boosteroid for now. It’s a good budget option and the latency is fine for me. The library has the games I want to play, so it works. It’s not as good as having a powerful local PC, but it is ""good enough"" for the price of a few coffees.

My plan is to use this as a bridge for the next 1 or 2 years. I’ll wait until this AI bubble pops or the hype goes away. Then I will finally build a real PC when prices are normal again. In the long run, own hardware is always better, but right now the cloud is just more practical.

I’m not really looking for advice on what to buy, I just want to hear what other people think about current situation. Is anyone else giving up on the hardware market for a while? Or are you still trying to find good deals?",1,1768691975.0,PcBuild,4,1.0,False

I'm also going to look at a second hand espresso machine (probably a Sage Bambino plus), as these also can go for around half price (£200),  I've fewer concerns about buying one of those second hand.   

I'd appreciate any thoughts from anyone else who has gone done the secondhand route, especially with these pieces of kit.   

My total budget is around \\\[£500\\\] but if I can do it cheaper and spend more on actual beans, I'd prefer that route. Especially as, if I get hooked, I expect I'll upgrade my kit for Christmas!",3,1768691906.0,espresso,3,0.81,False

● Go to sleep by 11am (blacked out room with fan and humidifier running).

● Wake up at 8pm, 30 mins on the treadmill, shower, eat a medium sized meal (akin to lunch), have a black coffee and chill before you have to be at work for 10pm.

● Ensure you have taken a mixture of healthy and sweet snacks to work, alongside a main meal (akin to dinner).

This is your opportunity to have another black coffee.

● Work steadily throughout the night, so that you still have a few more tasks left before the 4am crash. Do these between 4am - 6am to keep you going.

3am: time to stop drinking coffee and focus more on water.

● 6am: Home stretch. Ensure you've covered all basis.

● 9am: Once you have arrived at home, have a relaxing shower, watch a show or two, but ensure you are in your bed and ready to sleep by 11am.",4,1768691780.0,Nightshift,10,0.84,False

I’m a guy in my early 30s, she’s around the same age. We knew each other loosely from university years ago (same circles, saw each other a handful of times), then didn’t see each other for a long time. We’ve had each other on Instagram for years.

Last year, while I was skiing, she replied to one of my Instagram stories (“where are you / are you on the slopes?”). We ended up meeting up that day and it was genuinely fun — good banter, easy vibe.

Over the following months we stayed lightly in touch: occasional story replies, sending each other reels, likes, small jokes — nothing intense, and we’d also go quiet for weeks at a time.

Before the holidays, I posted a ski-related story and casually joked something like “we should go one day.” It wasn’t a direct invite, more like playful talk. Nothing happened immediately.

Recently, she invited me to go skiing with her and a couple of friends (a guy + a girl). We went, joked around, had a good time. After that we kept the same light contact: she’d comment on my stories, I’d reply, etc.

A few days later, I went skiing again midweek and I texted her on WhatsApp something like “classic workday” / “I’m skiing today.” She replied joking that seeing it “hurt” because she was stuck at work and jealous. I said the conditions were great and casually asked if she wanted to go again on the weekend. She reacted playfully (“you keep going!”) and said she had been thinking about it too.

The next day she messaged me first asking which day I preferred (Saturday or Sunday) “if she managed to organize herself.” We picked Saturday. She then drove a long way to come ski and meet me: from where she currently lives it’s about 2.5 hours to the resort. For me, getting there is about 1 hour.

We spent basically the whole day together (same chairlifts, waiting for each other, lunch + coffee). Warm greeting (hug + cheek kiss), lots of teasing and inside jokes (we kept joking about her falling / me “making her fall” / her “making me fall”), plus music talk and other life stuff. During the day she also had chances to merge with other people she knew, but we mostly stuck to our plan together.

Logistics-wise, we don’t live in the same city. I normally live in another European city, but right now I’m staying with my family in my hometown for a while. She lives in a different city as well, so meeting up takes some effort and planning.

Here’s the next step: next weekend she’s coming to the city where I live with a group of coworkers for a weekend trip/vacation. She casually mentioned a group night out, but I’m not really interested in joining a whole coworker group. I’d rather see her 1-on-1 (even just for 1–2 hours), but I don’t want to create pressure or make things awkward.

My questions:

	1.	Based on this pattern, does this sound like genuine romantic interest or more like “fun friend / activity buddy” vibes?

	2.	What’s the best low-pressure way to ask to meet 1-on-1 while she’s traveling with coworkers?

	3.	If she can’t break away from the group, how should I interpret that — lack of interest, or just group dynamics/logistics?

Thanks in advance.",0,1768691745.0,dating_advice,1,0.33,False

1qfrwtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qfrwtm/diet_and_digestive_system_problems_and_changes_2/,Diet and digestive system problems and changes 2 months after 3rd concussion. In pain and grateful for any help.,"Sorry, bear with me. I'm a 31F,  6'1, 190 lbs and had my third concussion roughly 2 months ago. I was hit in the head by accident twice in one day, by two different people. One hit to the front in the forehead eyebrow area in the morning and one hit to the back around the hair line while bending over in the evening. I work 1:1 respite and a day program for neurodivergent adults. 

I went to my family Dr a week after it happened. It was my mistake by not taking it so seriously and getting help sooner. I got time off work and I've been doing physio therapy since, which has been great. 

I have mild left over symptoms and getting better as time goes by, however I'm struggling hard with changes to my diet and digestive system that I can't get under control. 

I cannot eat anything that I was able to eat pre- 3rd concussion. I'm having cravings that I never normally have, like fruits and vegetables and healthy combinations of food I never would have touched before. I can no longer stomach highly processed foods, freezer meals/ frozen foods, fast food, crappy snacks, pastries, high sugared food items and deep fried stuff, sugary drinks like juice and pop. I MISS PIE.  And I want to eat this stuff, but I can't seem to get it down much or at all. I've been eating salads with nuts, kale and mixed greens with fruits and veg, fruits and vegetable snacks on their own, hard boiled eggs, roasted chicken, chicken vegetable soup, cream of broccoli soup (massive craving for that?!? And it's making me sick) and sandwiches plus lots of water and coffee. That's literally my entire diet since my concussion. Which doesn't seem so bad in reality, but it's not 'me'. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that this change happened because I've always struggled to consciously control my diet and emotional eating habits. I've been up to 300 pounds, and have had bad knees no matter what my weight is but obviously much better when I weigh less, so this diet change goes down a chain of ways it's been helpful. It's just weird and makes no sense to make such an extreme flip. 

And since my entire diet has flipped, my bowels are DYING. I've been cramping, in severe lower back and abdominal pain that goes down to my legs. Trapped gas in my chest and stomach and back. I have degenerative disc Disease and had surgery on some discs, it always hurts a bit but since my diet changes I feel like it's become so much worse.  I've been doing research on gut microbiome changes and detoxing and soluble/ insoluble fibre diets. I've been trying to treat my diet like I have IBS, it's not officially been diagnosed but I've had constipation, pain, bleeding hemorrhoids and gas for a years, and since my diet flipped the symptoms have gotten worse to the point where it's almost unbearable and I could cry. I can't get up off the couch some days from the pain. And way more fresh blood coming out then normal. It doesn't hurt, it's just startling. I can have up to 4 full bowel movements a day now. But my muscles are tired, my butt muscles and hips feel like they have literally run a marathon. I'm not trying to be gross, it's just such a wild experience. I'm not on any meds, just taking half a women's probiotic pill a day, the Centrum brand. 

Can anyone give some insight or data as to why the extreme changes, help me understand how to balance my diet better so I'm not harming myself accidently or even help me understand in general what's happening to my body. I get frustrated and confused on google, and I hate wasting Drs time if it's something I can get educated on and handle myself. I asked my Physio therapist but he's unsure. I'm also afraid that I'm being dramatic and just somehow lost my pain tolerance. I had frickin lower back surgery, then 3 weeks out went to a Gojira and Slipknot concert, I should be able to handle all this better than I am!!! 

I'd really appreciate any help and advice.

31 years old, I work in healthcare, I'd describe myself as an outdoor dog, and like driving my truck to far off places to lay on the hood and stargaze. I generally use banter as a form of for play, and into blue collar dudes who believe in class solidarity and like, women's rights (and wrongs). 

I keep my friends coffee orders saved in the notes on my phone; even the ones I don't talk to anymore. I love waking up on the days when the air smells the same as it did in 5th grade on book fair day. I believe deeply in the underdog and generally believe you should always do the right thing. I spend my free time volunteering, hosting suppers, and making playists for my friends. 

No, I won't make one for you off the rip. I need at minimum a 3 week talking period where we come to be tragically intwined, ultimately our paths will diverge, but we'll be looking for one another in everyone we meet thereafter. 

Anyhow, I figure myself a straight shooter. Your picture gets mine, one-word responses not needed.

Considering the demographic and common health conditions, I initially assumed SF syrups would be offered (a previous cruise on Royal Caribbean offered SF syrups too).

Anyways, since they don’t have them, would I be able to bring my own?  It’d either a 750ml glass bottle of Torani SF Vanilla syrup, or even Torani’s smaller size 325ml that’s in plastic bottle?  

I’ll be on another Princess cruise soon, departing out of San Pedro/LA again. I’d bring it in my carry-on, but kind of worried that it would be confiscated.  I don’t have a medical condition, just a dietary preference.",3,1768691423.0,PrincessCruises,9,0.67,False
