I was somewhat fine playing on expert until certain quests, like the goblin field one, with like 15 goblins attacking you at once. 

On expert they basically rolled over me, with every single of them having the ability to kill me in 2 hits. While on adept I can just stand there, get myself a coffee, come back and still have 90% of my HP.

Scenarios like this happened more often, the more I played. It gets annoying and really ruining my experience to switch the slider all the time.

# Introduction to Mid-Century Modern Design

Mid-century modern design is a distinctive style that emerged during the mid-20th century, primarily from the 1940s until the 1960s. Originating in the post-World War II era, it reflects a significant cultural shift that prioritised minimalism, functionality, and a connection to nature. Influenced by modernist principles and a desire to break away from traditional design conventions, mid-century modern aesthetics resonate with simplicity and clean lines.

Central to mid-century modern design by our [**Interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/) are its key characteristics: organic shap98TR342r plans sought to enhance the interaction between nature and living spaces. This seamless blend between the interior and exterior lends mid-century modern homes an inviting and airy feel.

As the world moved into the 21st century, the timeless appeal of mid-century modern interiors has resurfaced, influencing contemporary design trends. Its versatile nature allows for easy adaptability to modern living, catering to various tastes and preferences. Furthermore, the minimalist ethos associated with this style aligns well with today’s desire for sustainable and functional living environments. Each thoughtfully curated piece within a mid-century modern space is meant to evoke a sense of harmony and balance, fostering a calm and collected atmosphere that is highly valued in modern homes.

# Colour Palettes Inspired by the Mid-Century Era



https://preview.redd.it/1medaysyfywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50a9c8dd320b649c40af1bdf66c94bda01682c9c

Mid-century modern design is celebrated for its distinctive colour palettes that reflect the artistic movements and cultural shifts of the time. Characterised by our [**best interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/)**,** bold and vibrant hues and mid-century colour schemes often evoke feelings of nostalgia while remaining fresh and relevant in contemporary settings. Popular colours from this era include rich teal, warm mustard yellow, and a variety of earthy tones. These hues can seamlessly integrate into modern spaces, thereby enhancing the overall aesthetic.

Teal, for instance, is a versatile shade that exudes sophistication while adding a sense of tranquillity. When used on walls, it can create a calming backdrop for furniture and decor pieces, while accents in teal bring vibrancy without overwhelming the space. Mustard yellow, on the other hand, adds a lively pop of colour. Incorporating this shade through accessories such as cushions, artwork, or rugs can dynamically enliven a room, making it feel inviting and cheerful.

Earthy tones, including terracotta, olive green, and warm browns, provide a grounding effect, offering a connection to nature that is essential in creating a balanced interior. These shades can be used on larger furniture pieces or wall colours to establish a cohesive, warm foundation, which is particularly beneficial in open-plan living environments. Lighting also plays a critical role in how these colours are perceived. Natural light enhances their vibrancy during the day, while softer, ambient lighting can soften the hues in the evening, creating a cosy atmosphere.

Ultimately, the emotional impact of these colour palettes cannot be underestimated. By thoughtfully incorporating mid-century modern colours, one can achieve not only a visually appealing space but also an environment that promotes well-being and comfort. This integration of signature hues captures the essence of mid-century design while adapting to contemporary lifestyles.

# Furniture Selection: Key Pieces for Every Room



https://preview.redd.it/vm9iebp0gywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73ab6ce03e0869d8644205f1e062c78b751b3885

Selecting the right furniture from the [**Top 10 interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com) is pivotal in establishing a mid-century modern interior design that resonates with both classic elegance and contemporary appeal. To achieve a true reflection of this aesthetic, one must consider iconic pieces that define the mid-century modern style, ensuring they serve both functional and visual purposes within each room.

One of the standout items in any mid-century modern space is the Eames Lounge Chair. Designed by Charles and Ray Eames in the 1950s, this chair combines comfort with sophisticated design, featuring a moulded plywood body and leather upholstery. Its timeless appeal makes it an exemplary focal point in living rooms or studies. When integrating this chair into your space, consider its placement near a minimalist side table to enhance relaxation without overwhelming the room’s aesthetics.

Another essential piece is the coffee table, which often serves as the cornerstone of the living area. Opt for one with clean lines, such as a low-profile, rectangular walnut or teak table, which complements seating arrangements while embodying the mid-century philosophy of form following function. Pairing the coffee table with a rug featuring geometric patterns can further accentuate the area, adding visual warmth and definition.

Additionally, credenzas provide not only storage but also serve as display areas for decorative items. Look for pieces with tapered legs, sliding doors, and rich wood finishes, which epitomise the mid-century modern flair. Positioning a credenza against a wall can create a seamless flow while allowing for art or other decorative pieces to be showcased above it.

While selecting these key furniture pieces, it is crucial to maintain a balance between unique character and cohesive design. Mixing iconic mid-century elements with modern accents can result in a polished space that honours the era’s roots while remaining relevant to today’s design trends. The careful arrangement of furniture will ensure that each piece contributes to an overall harmonious atmosphere in your home.

# Incorporating Natural Materials for Authenticity



https://preview.redd.it/h6vq38q2gywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8771175202c6c0716991c826f8fc0e65a543b4cc

Mid-century modern design is distinguished by its emphasis on organic aesthetics and the seamless integration of natural materials. The use of wood, leather, and stone not only reflects a connection to nature but also contributes to the warmth and character of living spaces. These materials were chosen in mid-century design for their durability and the tactile qualities they offer, which enhance the overall ambience of a home.

Wood remains a central element in mid-century modern interiors, often appearing in furniture and architectural details. Rich, warm woods such as teak, walnut, and oak are ideal choices, adding depth and texture to rooms. To incorporate wood into contemporary designs, consider features like exposed beams, wooden accent walls, or furnishings crafted from sustainably sourced materials. This infusion of natural elements evokes an authentic mid-century vibe and fosters a cosy environment that invites relaxation.

Leather, particularly in neutral tones, complements wooden pieces beautifully and adds a touch of sophistication to spaces. Options include leather upholstery for furniture, such as sofas and armchairs, as well as leather accessories like cushions and throws. Incorporating these elements provides tactile contrast and invites a sense of warmth, which is especially important in maintaining a comfortable atmosphere.

Stone, in its many forms, adds to the holistic feel of mid-century modern interiors. Whether through a stone fireplace, countertops, or flooring, the presence of natural stone symbolises permanence and stability. To achieve a mid-century modern look today, consider integrating elements like honed marble or textured stones to create visual interest without overwhelming other design aspects.

In essence, incorporating these natural materials into your home not only respects the fundamental principles of mid-century modern design but also creates an inviting and authentic sanctuary. The thoughtful use of wood, leather, and stone will undoubtedly imbue interiors with a timeless quality, enhancing both aesthetic and comfort.

# Lighting: Iconic Fixtures to Illuminate Your Space



https://preview.redd.it/diykejh4gywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71f208d2464091364f261d3fa4bd08f1c56a55d1

Lighting is an essential element in mid-century modern interior design, as it serves both functional and aesthetic purposes. Characterised by clean lines and geometric shapes, mid-century lighting fixtures continue to influence contemporary home designs. Iconic options such as pendant lights, floor lamps, and wall sconces perfectly complement the minimalist and organic aesthetics typical of this style. The careful selection of these fixtures can create focal points that enhance the overall ambience of your living space.

Pendant lights are particularly effective in mid-century modern homes, showcasing bold forms and often featuring materials such as brass, glass, or wood. A well-placed pendant light can draw the eye upward, adding depth to a room while providing sufficient illumination. When selecting pendant lighting, it is crucial to consider both size and scale to ensure it harmonises with the surrounding décor. Opting for fixtures that incorporate playful colours or innovative shapes can instantly elevate the mid-century vibe in a room.

Similarly, floor lamps from the mid-century modern era exemplify the seamless blend of form and function. Many models are designed with adjustable heights and movable shades, allowing homeowners to customise the lighting effect based on their specific needs. Look for floor lamps featuring materials like metal or wood, which resonate with the overall warmth and elegance of mid-century design. When integrating floor lamps into your space, consider placing them near seating areas or reading nooks to create inviting and well-lit corners.

In addition to pendant lights and floor lamps, wall sconces can also enhance the mid-century modern aesthetic. These fixtures often reflect the era’s penchant for simplicity and craft, and they can be used to highlight artwork or architectural features. When selecting wall sconces, choose designs that complement other lighting elements throughout your home. By doing so, you create a cohesive lighting scheme that speaks to the characteristics of mid-century modern design, allowing you to illuminate your space stylishly.

# Creating Open Spaces with Functionality



https://preview.redd.it/2v18t8y6gywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0eef823c7e4ea807eb5da1cc039176ccc658e66

Open floor plans are a foundational element of mid-century modern interior design, emphasising fluidity and harmony between living spaces. This design philosophy champions an unobstructed flow, where the living, dining, and kitchen areas coexist seamlessly, fostering an environment that feels both spacious and inviting. To achieve this effect, it is essential to approach the arrangement of furniture strategically.

Furniture selection plays a pivotal role in creating functional yet aesthetic open spaces. Opt for multi-functional pieces such as ottomans that can serve as seating or storage, effectively maximising utility without compromising style. When arranging furniture, consider maintaining clear sightlines to maintain that fluidity characteristic of mid-century homes. For instance, placing a low-profile sofa facing an open dining area allows for interaction between spaces, which is crucial for family gatherings or entertaining guests.

Incorporating area rugs can help delineate different zones within an open floor plan, subtly defining the space for living, dining, and cooking while maintaining an overall sense of continuity. The placement of rugs should be strategic; ensure that all key pieces of furniture sit comfortably upon the rug, creating visual cohesion while allowing for easy movement throughout the area. Natural materials, such as wood and stone, prevalent in mid-century modern design, can further enhance the connection between these spaces, contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere.

Lighting also plays a vital role in enhancing the openness of a floor plan. Consider using pendant lights or floor lamps that provide both function and focus, accentuating the design elements while ensuring each area is well-lit. Large windows or open doors leading to outdoor spaces can also amplify the sense of openness, allowing natural light to flood the interiors, making the spaces feel even larger.

# Textures and Patterns: Adding Depth to Your Design



https://preview.redd.it/w11siml8gywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=464dcd5d7a7860a3d18d0d71bfaae57124a870fc

The integration of textures and patterns is a significant aspect of mid-century modern interior design, which emphasises a clean and functional aesthetic while remaining visually engaging. The intelligent use of [**luxury interior designers in Mumbai**](https://www.home2decor.com/)**,** various materials not only enhances the tactile experience of a space but also brings depth and character to the overall design. In this context, incorporating a range of fabrics—such as wool, cotton, and synthetic fibres—serves to create a rich interplay of sensations that can elevate the design while preserving the minimalistic ethos characteristic of this style.

When selecting textiles for mid-century modern interiors, it is essential to balance the tactile qualities with appropriate geometric patterns. Geometric patterns are emblematic of the mid-century modern movement and can be successfully implemented through area rugs, wallpaper, and upholstery. These patterns add interest to a space and can draw attention to specific architectural elements or focal points in the room. Opting for rugs with graphic designs in complementary colour palettes can anchor the furnishings and harmonise the space, thereby creating an inviting atmosphere.

However, while the incorporation of varied textures and patterns is crucial, it is equally important to maintain a sense of coherence and avoid visual clutter. A well-balanced approach involves selecting a distinct colour scheme and using patterns that complement rather than compete with each other. One effective strategy is to mix bold geometric designs with more understated textures, allowing the latter to act as a backdrop that supports the overall aesthetic without overwhelming it. Ultimately, a thoughtful combination of textures and patterns contributes to the harmonious experience of mid-century modern interiors, inviting both comfort and sophistication into the living space.

# Art and Accessories: Finishing Touches to Consider



https://preview.redd.it/fgw6seqagywe1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e1937ff80cfdd5fee9adc682cd6a413f161dcd5

Art and accessories are fundamental components in crafting a mid-century modern interior, as they can significantly influence the overall aesthetic of the space. In this design style, the aim is to create a harmonious balance between function and form, ensuring that each piece complements the minimalist lines and organic shapes characteristic of mid-century modernism. When selecting artwork, focus on pieces that embody the ethos of the period. Abstract art is particularly resonant, often characterised by bold colours, geometric forms, and an emphasis on simplicity.

Consider incorporating works by renowned mid-century artists such as Wassily Kandinsky or Mark Rothko, whose compositions can serve as focal points in a room. Additionally, it is essential to contemplate the scale and placement of artwork. Large canvases can make a statement in open spaces, while smaller pieces can be grouped together to create a gallery wall that adds visual interest without cluttering the area.

Beyond wall art, accessories such as sculptures and decorative objects should harmonise with the chosen artwork. Look for unique items that reflect the organic and sculptural qualities inherent in mid-century modern design. Vintage finds, such as ceramic vases or wooden sculptures, can introduce a sense of history and authenticity to your decor. Alternatively, contemporary adaptations that echo mid-century styles can bring a fresh perspective, ensuring that your design remains relevant in 2025 without losing its foundational spirit.

In essence, the art and accessories selected should serve to enhance the mid-century modern aesthetic, creating a cohesive and inviting environment. The key is to remain mindful of the overall design while carefully curating pieces that resonate with the principles of this timeless style.

Incorporating sustainable practices into mid-century modern design not only honours the elegance of this timeless aesthetic but also promotes environmental responsibility. This design philosophy, famous for its clean lines and functional forms, can seamlessly integrate eco-friendly principles through various methods. One of the most effective approaches is to utilise eco-friendly materials that align with both mid-century aesthetics and sustainability criteria. For instance, choosing natural materials such as reclaimed wood, bamboo, or recycled metals can enhance the design’s character while reducing the ecological footprint.

Another crucial aspect of sustainable mid-century modern design is the reusing and refurbishing of vintage items. Rather than purchasing new furniture, look for quality pieces from the mid-century era that can be restored to their original grandeur. This not only reduces waste but also preserves the craftsmanship of the period. Consider updating upholstery or refinishing wood surfaces to breathe new life into these classic items. Incorporating elements such as vintage lighting or art can also create a cohesive space that reflects the charm of mid-century design while promoting sustainability.

Moreover, when selecting products for your space, it is essential to prioritise sustainable brands and locally-sourced goods. Many companies now specialise in creating mid-century modern pieces from eco-friendly materials and processes. By making informed decisions, it is possible to curate an interior that combines aesthetic appeal with a commitment to sustainability, supporting both the environment and local economies.



*In conclusion, integrating sustainable practices into mid-century modern design allows homeowners to create striking environments that respect both aesthetic values and ecological ethics. By prioritising eco-friendly materials, reusing vintage furniture, and supporting sustainable brands, it is possible to achieve a stylish yet responsible living space.*",1,1745575639.0,interiorvibes,0,1.0,False

1k7h5sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1k7h5sh/hashimotos_medications_weight_loss_and_long_covid/,"Hashimoto's, medications, weight loss, and long covid.","I have 5 diagnosed that covid gave me, including Hashimoto's. I'm sure many of you have seen me mention it. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, Hashimoto's, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. All diagnosed after I developed long covid/PASC.
**If you doubt this statement, please read the information at the bottom of the post.**

I frequently share this information about thyroid levels, medications, diet, intermittent fasting, weight loss, and long covid. I figured it was time to put it all together. If you're struggling with your thyroid levels, symptoms like anxiety, brain fog, depression, severe fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, insomnia/sleep disturbances, weight gain or inability to lose weight. Keep reading:

Have you had a recent CBC, a complete thyroid panel, and checking all vitamin levels? Deficiencies in B12, D, and Iron can wreck havoc on your body. Have you been tested for celiac disease? Some people have non-celiac gluten intolerance.

I would schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN. Your symptoms could be caused by the type of birth control you use, your hormone levels, and/or other medical issues. 

Have you noticed certain foods aggravate your symptoms? Many people try an AIP or elimination diet to see if they have any food triggers. Some people try a diet without gluten, dairy, and sugar to see if there is a reduction in their symptoms. 

I completely overhauled my diet last year. I did an anti-inflammation diet. My dysautonomia and hypothyroidism caused non-diabetic nocturnal hypoglycemia attacks. I had to change my diet. I added premier protein shakes with 30 grams of protein. My favorite flavors are cake batter, cinnamon roll, lemon, and peanut butter cup. And fruit cups or applesauce without added sugar. That way, I get protein, carbohydrates, and natural sugar added into my diet. I have blueberries with peanut butter. I have low-fat cottage cheese with fruit like watermelon or bananas. I love salads and vegetables but I can't eat much of it. I have complex carbohydrates like whole wheat pasta and sweet potato fries. I like frozen chicken breasts and frozen precut vegetables like carrots, green beans, peas, and butternut squash. Recently, I have noticed that my symptoms are more severe than they used to be. I added more meat, dairy, and complex carbohydrates into my diet. The changes I've made include: I've added yogurt into my diet. I have potato bowls with potatoes, some shredded cheese, and canned chicken or ground beef for dinner. I was diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in September 2024. I switched to a low histamine diet. I've added foods back in as tolerated.

I do limit processed carbohydrates, additives, and sugars. I love chocolate cake and have a slice 1-2 times a month. I have takeout 1-2 times a month. I stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. I stopped drinking coffee and soda. I added iced coffee back into my diet last week. No caffeine after 6pm. I don't drink alcohol, smoke, or vape.

Many people can not tolerate gluten, sugar, or dairy. In my case, I did that for several months. It did not improve my symptoms. 

I do intermittent fasting as well. I'll have an eating/fast window of: 8hr/16hr or 10hr/14hr. That's typically intermittent fasting for 14-16 hours. Some days I don't follow it. You have to keep your metabolism guessing. Our bodies get very efficient at estimating the number of calories we eat. It holds onto the calories and inhibits weight loss. I lost 40lbs last year. I've lost 10lbs this year.

>Intermittent fasting can activate autophagy, a process that breaks down cellular waste. Autophagy can help protect against diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's and may even extend lifespan.

>How does intermittent fasting activate autophagy?
When you fast, your body recycles existing components to meet energy needs. 
This process breaks down damaged or unwanted cellular components, such as broken proteins. 
Autophagy also gets rid of nonfunctional cell parts that take up space and slow performance.  

[What are the benefits of intermittent fasting?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323605)

Are you taking any vitamins or supplements? I had a complete vitamin panel done recently. My vitamin levels are in the normal range.

I take NatureBell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex. Or I take Magnesiu-OM powder (magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan) 1-2 hours before bed. I alternate between the two. I purchased them from Amazon. They significantly help with calmness, muscle cramps, pain, relaxation, and sleep. Magnesiu-OM will keep you regular.

>Here's information on Magnesiu-OM: Every cell in the body needs Magnesium to function and over 50% of us have a magnesium deficiency. Magnesi-Om® is a magnesium powder supplement that contains 3 bioavailable forms of Magnesium plus L-Theanine to help restore cellular balance for relaxation, brain health, and regularity.* Chelated Magnesium Gluconate and Acetyl Taurinate support muscle relaxation and cognitive function, while Magnesium Citrate supports regular bowel movements.* L-Theanine promotes alpha‑wave activity in the brain, shown to encourage a focused calm.* Our natural magnesium powder supplement instantly dissolves in water.

As always, discuss any GABA, 5-HTP, or L-tryptophan supplements with your doctor if you're taking psychotropic medications like SSRIs.

Are you taking any medications that cause weight gain?

Have you had covid? Did your symptoms get worse after covid? Have you heard of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HIT)?

Please read: 
[MCAS and ME/CFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/s/sGU7tz6rJD)

I have 5 diagnoses that covid gave me, including ME/CFS. My ME/CFS is severe, and I've been bedridden for 15 months. I can tell you that losing 50lbs has absolutely improved all of my symptoms. Also, keep in mind that weight loss is 80-90% diet and 10-20% exercise. I lost 60lbs while being bedridden.

If you're struggling, I'm sorry you're struggling. I hope you find some answers. I love this community. Hugs💜

**Viruses have triggered autoimmune diseases over the years.**

It’s well known that many viruses are capable of triggering autoimmune diseases, including: Parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV),
Herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), Hepatitis A and C, and
Rubella virus. Experts believe these viruses trigger chronic and cascading inflammation -- a factor in autoimmunity -- and eventually develop into an autoimmune condition such as Hashimoto’s and many more. There are a few explanations for how viruses can induce autoimmunity,

>Viral infection of the target cells: COVID-19 can trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines are part of your immune system that helps regulate the immune response and inflammation associated with an infection.

>In this case, the release of too many pro-inflammatory cytokines causes excess inflammation. Furthermore, antibodies against COVID-19 may react with the thyroid tissues. Antibodies are made by your immune system against a virus or bacteria. They allow for the detection and destruction of a virus or bacteria. However, if COVID-19 antibodies mistakenly react with the thyroid tissues, this may trigger a new autoimmune disorder, in this case, Hashimoto’s.

>As for its aetiology, a series of studies have indicated that environmental factors play a critical role in the development of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and a growing body of evidence suggests viral infection, one of the triggering factors of the disease.

>There are many viruses that have been implicated in Hashimoto's, but the most common viruses that I have found in my clinical practice are: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Herpes Simplex 1 & 2 (HSV) Hepatitis C infection (the treatment is also a trigger).

I'm one of millions of people who've been diagnosed with multiple medical illnesses after I developed long covid. Covid **triggered** my Hashimoto's. 
People don't know more than the doctors who have treated covid patients for five years. People don't know more than my doctors or specialists.

I received five separate medical diagnoses in an 11-month timespan after I developed long covid. I went from a fully functioning person to a person whose life has been catastrophically deciminated overnight. One of those five diagnoses is ME/CFS. My ME/CFS is severe, and I've been bedridden for 16 months. In ME/CFS patients, 80% are diagnosed after a viral trigger, **like COVID-19.**",1,1745575134.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False
1k7h5fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1k7h5fv/how_i_used_chatgpt_to_write_my_first_story_on/,"""How I Used ChatGPT to Write My First Story on r/stories""","I never thought I’d be the type of person to write a story, let alone post one online for strangers to read. But here I am, writing a story about writing a story—with a little help from AI.

So it started on a random Tuesday night. I was bored, sipping on some terrible instant coffee, and scrolling Reddit like usual. I came across a post on r/stories that absolutely sucked me in—something about a mysterious train that only appeared at midnight. The writing was gripping, the comments were buzzing, and I just sat there thinking, Man, I wish I could write like that.

Then I remembered ChatGPT. I’d played around with it before—asked it to write a breakup text (don’t judge me), plan a vacation, even help with a resume. But I’d never really pushed it for anything creative. So I opened it up and typed:

> ""Hey ChatGPT, help me write a short story for Reddit. Something weird but believable—like it could’ve happened, but with a twist.""

It replied almost instantly, asking a few follow-up questions:
""Do you want horror, mystery, or slice-of-life? Should the twist be supernatural or psychological?""

I picked psychological thriller, because those always mess with your head in the best way.

ChatGPT started spitting out this story about a guy who begins receiving voicemails from a phone that had been disconnected for years. The pacing? Spot on. The vibe? Creepy, but not cliché. I added a few touches of my own—some dialogue, a weird subplot about the guy’s sister who went missing when they were kids. It was weirdly therapeutic, like co-writing with a tireless, non-judgmental partner.

After a bit of editing (and a Reddit-friendly title), I posted it on r/stories:
""My Phone Rang at 2:13 AM Every Night—Until I Answered It""

The response was insane. Upvotes came in fast. People were commenting things like “This gave me chills” and “Please tell me this is fiction.” One person even asked if I was a published author.

And the wildest part? I didn’t feel like I cheated. ChatGPT didn’t write the story for me—it co-wrote it with me. It was like having an idea machine that never gets tired or runs out of words.

So yeah. I used ChatGPT to write a story, posted it on r/stories, and watched it blow up. And now, I guess, I’m a writer?

Anyway, thanks for reading. And if you’re thinking about trying it—just do it. You never know what you and an AI might come up with together.

At our daughter’s funeral, while the scent of lilies still clung to the air and the priest’s final words barely faded, he stood there with his arm around her like it was the most natural thing in the world. Like we weren’t burying a child. 

Our child. 

He didn’t even look sad. 

Then he glanced at me, his voice smooth, rehearsed. “Sabrina’s a good person. Even after everything she’s been through, she still came in person to pay her respects. If Lyra is watching from above, she’ll look after her little brother and make sure he grows up safe and healthy.“!! 

His tone made it sound like he was eulogizing someone else’s child, like Sabrina was the one grieving. 

Not me. 

Not the mother standing there with a hollowed–out chest. 

I didn’t say a word. 

Instead, I slipped off the wedding ring I’d worn for six years, turned around, and walked straight out of the funeral hall without once looking back. 

Later, a few of the older relatives tried to smooth things over, whispering apologies and excuses. 

And Brandon? He just gave a cold, smug little laugh. 

“Don’t bother with her,” he said. “Let her throw her tantrum. She’ll come crawling back eventually, begging for another chance.“2 

The entire Doyle family burst out laughing like he’d cracked the joke of the century. And they weren’t subtle about it either. They had actual money riding on me–bets on when I’d break, when I’d come crawling back to Brandon, begging him to give me another child. 

But what none of them knew was that the private jet–booked by Brandon himself, no less–was already in the air. 

Three more hours, and I’d be gone.} 

Gone from Port City. Gone for good. 

Back in the villa, I was upstairs packing when Brandon finally came home. He didn’t ask what I was doing, nor did he even glance at the suitcase. Like it was any other day, he just took off his coat and loosened his tie. 

Completely casual, he said, “Hey, Camilla, Sabrina’s craving chicken soup.” 

“The nerve of him… I crumpled my hand into a fist, calmly trying not to retaliate 

Right then, my mind jumped back to that night at the office when I refused to bring Sabrina a cup of coffee. Brandon made me kneel there, in front of everyone, all night long like some pathetic lesson in obedience. 

Two hours left and I’m done here,” I said to myself.ll- 

Recollecting myself, I zipped up my bag and headed for the kitchen. Ten minutes later, I heard Sabrina giggling from the living room, all Syrupy sweet! 

“Mmm, this soup’s amazing,” she said. 

Brandon’s face relaxed a little. The usual tension around his mouth softened. Then he turned to me. 

“Camilla,” he said, “as long as you treat Sabrina’s baby like it’s your own, I won’t divorce you.“\] 

Not long ago, there was a time when just hearing the word ‘divorce‘ would’ve wrecked me.\]: 

My heart would’ve jumped. My hands would’ve shaken.X 

But now?% 

Now I reached into my purpe, pulled out the divorce papers. I’d been holding onto for months, and laid them in front of him.N 

“Sign it,” I said quietly. 

He didn’t even glance at them. Just arched a brow and snorted. 

“Camilla, really? You think this weak–ass reverse psychology move is gonna work on me? I told you the day we got married. I only picked you because you looked like Sabrina. And if you’re still gonna act like this, I’ll just ship you overseas and leave you there to rot 

Before I could get a word in, Sabrina let out this dramatic little gasp.8 

Brandon spun around like someone had pulled the fire alarm. “Sabrina? What’s wrong?” 

“Brandon… I don’t know. I just feel itchy. All over,” she said, her voice soft and pitiful 

Her acting was so bad it was almost funny–like high school theater level. 

But of course, Brandon didn’t care. 

He was in full–blown panic mode–just not for me K 

He stormed across the room, his face twisted in fury “What the hell did you put in the soup?!” he barked, charging toward me like I’d just tried to commit a felony. “Are you trying to poison her?” 

I barely had time to part my lips before he grabbed the bowl off the table, scooped up what was left, and shoved the spoon mouth, forcing it down my throat without a second thought.

I used to crave sweet junk food. But the last couple of days, I keep thinking about these tasty, healthy meals I've made, looking forward to the next sitting.

I've recently introduced 2 day water fasts a week, into my schedule. Only 2 weeks I've been doing this.

And whilst I've been doing a 7 hour eating window each day for a long time, I've made some recent changes.

1. I'm not eating any ultra processed foods. And I've cut out all grains, apart from oat bran.

2. For the last week I've been cooking everything from scratch, trying to include lots of different plants, nuts, seeds, olive oil, alongside proteins such as oily fish (salmon, sardines), and grass fed beef. 

3. I no longer drink coffee! I used to take it first thing - 3 strong cups, with no food until 10am. I'm not feeling anxious anymore, I think cortisol from the morning coffee was impacting me.

4. I've replaced (3) by drinking a warm water mixed with psyllium husk. And cups of red bush tea.


But it's strange, I've never craved home cooked healthy meals to this extent. And I'm not interested in chocolate or sweet things anymore!

2. **Guard your energy like runway** Time is cheap when you’re wiped out. I block Wednesdays for a swim + sauna and don’t open the laptop till noon—output still spikes. Track when you’re sharpest and book deep work there. Burnout sneaks up; don’t invite it.
3. **Ship fast, fix later** Decide what “done” means before you start, slice the extras and get version 1 out. Feedback beats perfection every time. The quicker you loop, the faster you learn.
4. **Run a weekly retro** Friday, 30 minutes: What moved the needle? What was noise? Re-rank next week’s tasks and nuke the fluff. I toss the list into ChatGPT for a sanity check; it flags blind spots I miss.
5. **Find your people** Solo-founder romance is overrated. Slack groups, coffee chats, whatever—talk to folks who get the stakes. A blunt question from another founder has saved me months of wandering.
6. **Track three numbers, tops** I watch cash runway, active users and churn—nothing else hits the wall. Update them daily, pin them where you can’t ignore them. When the trend whispers, listen.

M27 F25","I’m 27, and my ex-wife is 25. I wouldn’t say that all 8 years of our relationship were pure torment. But the girl I was with (let’s call her Anna) just didn’t grow. For her, the relationship started quite early, I mean at 18, and it lasted 8 years. I tried to handle all her issues, giving her gifts, care, and so on. But everything changed about 1.5 years ago when I caught her lying for the first time. From the start, our relationship was built on complete, total honesty, no matter how bitter the truth might be, and she knew very well that I can’t stand lies. But let’s get back to topic.

About 1.5 years ago, she got a new job after a pretty long search. She had been at home for over a year, not working anywhere. I supported her as much as I could, even though she was already dealing with depression. But then, a miracle—she found a pretty good job at a private school (for kids of wealthy parents). I never thought people could be so materialistic, but that’s not the point right now. It was normal for me to pick her up from work after my own workday. And then there was some kind of corporate event at that school. She said she’d be late, and I said, “Okay.” 

But for some reason, that evening, I felt really uneasy, so I decided to pick her up from work anyway. I went out, warmed up the car, called her, and asked...

- Hey, how are you?  
- Hey, I’m still at the corporate event.  

In the background, I could hear music and the voices of other people. I said:  
- Alright, I’ll wait for you.  

But at that moment, I drove to a coffee shop near that private school. I drank a cup of coffee there, scrolled through my phone, and then decided to call her again.  

- How are you? Everything okay?  
- Yeah, everything’s great, I’m still there.  
- Okay.  

And then I drove to her school.  

I arrived at the gates—they were automatic and would close when no one was in the building. Since the school was premium-class, most of the walls were made of glass. And I was really shocked to see that there were no lights on at all.

I decided to call her again and ask where she was. After all, just 15 minutes ago, she said she was still there.  
- Hello, where are you?  
- I’m still at the corporate event at the school.  

And then it hit me—I didn’t hear any music in the background, just one male voice. Damn it, I thought.  
- How can you be at the school when I’m standing right outside it, and there’s no light anywhere, and it’s completely closed?  

She only replied:  
- I just left and I’m walking home with a colleague from work. He lives close to us, so we’re going the same way.  

I couldn’t hold back. It was pretty late, and she could’ve easily taken a taxi home, but instead, she chose to walk with some guy at night.  
- Bring that guy, I’m waiting for you both at the school entrance. I’ll drive you both home.  

And I hung up…

I don’t know what was going through my head at the time, but I was furious, really furious.  
She came up 15 minutes later from the direction of the residential courtyards, completely alone.  
- And where’s your friend?  
I asked.  
She replied:  
- He said he’d walk home.

The whole way home, I explained to her that she can’t do that, that by acting this way, she’s giving this guy some kind of hope and signaling that she’s available for a relationship.

I used to crave sweet junk food. But the last couple of days, I keep thinking about these tasty, healthy meals I've made, looking forward to the next sitting.

I've recently introduced 2 day water fasts a week, into my schedule. Only 2 weeks I've been doing this.

And whilst I've been doing a 7 hour eating window each day for a long time, I've made some recent changes.

1. I'm not eating any ultra processed foods. And I've cut out all grains, apart from oat bran.

2. In the last week, Ive been cooking everything from scratch, trying to include lots of different plants, nuts, seeds, olive oil, alongside proteins such as oily fish (salmon, sardines), and grass fed beef.

3. I no longer drink coffee! I used to take it first thing - 3 strong cups, with no food until 10am. I'm not feeling anxious anymore, I think cortisol from the morning coffee was impacting me.

4. I've replaced (3) by drinking a warm water mixed with psyllium husk. And cups of red bush tea.


But it's strange, I've never craved home cooked healthy meals to this extent. And I'm not interested in chocolate or sweet things anymore!

Where I live (Poland) PrimaDonna Aromatic is 500$ more expensive than Eletta Explorer. I called DeLonghi to ask what's the difference between the models.

  
PrimaDonna Aromatic has electrically controlled coffee grinder. The grinder is controlled manually in Eletta Explorer. 

Eletta Explorer has user profiles and PrimaDonna Aromatic doesn't have profiles.  Eletta Explorer also comes with a container for cold milk in the cheapest variant (PrimaDonna Aromatic doesn't, you need to pay extra).

  
It's a big trade off for me, user profiles seem way more important than electrically controlling the grinder (which I will probably do once and forget about it). 



Am I missing something? Why should I pay 500$ more for a machine with seemingly less features? Or is there something else?

Skyscrapers once brimming with light and laughter now stood hollow, their windows shattered like broken dreams. The streets below were littered with twisted metal, decayed bodies, and the scent of rust and rot. The air beyond the walls smelled of death—a thick, choking staleness that clung to the skin and burned the nostrils.

The government’s last act of unity had been to divide the military into three distinct factions. Anchor of Eagle (AOE) took the frontlines, tasked with exterminating the infected in the vast ruins beyond the fortified zones. Strike Force rained death from the skies, their jets a terrifying thunder overhead. Tiger Claw kept the warriors supplied, parachuting crates of ammunition, rations, and medical aid into hellish landscapes.

Among AOE’s ranks stood Evan, a hardened soldier forged by blood and loss. He had taken in his nephew Tron after his brother’s brutal death, raising him like his own son. Over the years, Evan shaped Tron with discipline, honesty, and unrelenting training. Now at twenty, Tron had become the top cadet in AOE, a soldier whose scars ran deeper than skin.

But this morning… this morning was quiet. Too quiet.

Morning in Genshain Safe Zone

Golden morning sunlight spilled through the narrow kitchen window, catching dust motes as they danced in the air. The walls were old but clean, the tile floor worn from years of heavy boots. The soft hiss of frying beef filled the room, mingling with the warm aroma of coffee and freshly baked bread. Mouri stood at the stove, her loose bun swaying as she flipped meat in the pan, the sizzle loud and satisfying.

Evan sat at the table, stripped down to his undershirt, tattoos stretching across his muscled arms as he sipped his black coffee. Tron, shirtless but in military fatigue pants, leaned over the table, already shoveling forkfuls of beef and eggs into his mouth.

Tron (mouth half full): “Mom, this is amazing. Seriously, how the hell did you get beef to taste this good?”

Mouri (smiling warmly): “Your grandmother’s recipe. She used to add just a hint of brown sugar and garlic before searing it.”

Tron: “You ever think about ditching the nurse gig and opening a diner?”

Evan (chuckling): “We’d call it Apocalypse Bites. First customer gets a free bulletproof vest.”

Mouri laughed softly, wiping her hands on her apron. The sound of her laughter filled the space with rare warmth, like a fading echo of the old world.

Mouri: “Alright, enough sweet-talking. Tron, grab those plates and bring them over. Let’s get this cleaned up.”

Tron stood, stretching his arms as his joints popped faintly. He moved toward her and handed over his dish.

Mouri (gently): “Thank you, my son.”

She kissed him on the cheek. Her lips were soft, her breath warm. Tron smiled, his eyes softening for a moment.

As he turned to leave, Evan rose from his chair, stepping behind Mouri. Without warning, he slipped his arms around her waist and pulled her close, pressing his lips against the curve of her neck. She gasped, then giggled as his rough hands tightened slightly on her hips.

Mouri: “Evan! What are you doing?”

Evan (low, gravelly voice): “Loving my wife.”

Mouri (blushing): “Tron’s right there—”

Evan: “Let him learn what real love looks like.”

He spun her around and kissed her—slowly, deeply. Mouri melted into him, her hands resting against his chest. The smell of coffee and meat faded into something more intimate—skin, sweat, and warmth.

Tron re-entered the room, catching them mid-kiss.

Tron (with mock disgust): “Tsk. You two can make out after we’re back. We leave in fifteen.”

Evan (grinning as he pulled away): “Alright, alright.”

Mouri (breathless, wiping her lips): “I’m heading to the hospital. You two stay safe. And don’t be heroes.”

She kissed them both on the cheek, softer this time, and exited the house with a calm that belied the storm ahead.

Tron and Evan finished gearing up. The kitchen, filled just moments ago with warmth and laughter, fell into silence. The air felt heavier now.


---

AOE Training Grounds

Gunfire cracked across the open field like thunder. The scent of gunpowder mingled with sweat and oil. Dummies rigged with armor and fake flesh were torn apart by precise, rapid bursts from M4 rifles.

Tron’s shots hit clean and fast—center mass, throat, forehead.

Evan (glancing over): “Again. You're faster today.”

Tron (lowering his rifle): “Told you I don’t sleep on progress.”

Evan smirked and moved them to the combat zone. The scent of trampled dirt filled the air. Soldiers squared off in hand-to-hand drills, grunts and the clack of training knives striking echoed through the arena.

Evan: “Knives are personal. Up close. Loud guns won’t always save you.”

Tron nodded, mirroring Evan’s grip—a reverse hold, fingers tight, blade aimed backward.

Evan: “Come at me.”

Tron lunged, but his wrist was caught mid-air. Evan twisted with ease.

Evan: “Faster. Fluid. Don’t think—move.”

Evan demonstrated—one clean arc, the blade slicing through the air with a whistle.

Tron adjusted. Again. And again. Until—

Tron (exhales): “Like this?”

Evan: “Perfect. Your grandfather would’ve been proud.”

Then—sharp, authoritative—

Commander Ali: “ATTENTION!”

Boots slammed to position. Commander Ali strode across the yard. Sixty-five, short but steel-willed. Bald head gleaming, black eyes sharp beneath weathered brows.

Ali: “You’re ready. You’ve trained hard. Now it's time to test it. Your first patrol outside the walls begins today.”

A heavy silence fell.

Ali (louder): “You’ve got one job—come back breathing. Gear up.”

The order sent a jolt of adrenaline down every spine.


---

First Patrol Outside the Wall

In the barracks, the metallic clatter of gear being fastened was nonstop. Tron's vest hugged his torso tightly, every weapon checked, cleaned, loaded. His fingers trembled—just a little—as he locked his knife in place.

Evan noticed.

Evan (quiet): “You ready?”

Tron: “Always.”

Evan: “No fear out there. You fight scared, you die scared.”

They locked eyes—father and son in everything but blood.

Inside the Armored Vehicle

The engine growled beneath them, a deep mechanical purr. The inside of the armored vehicle was cramped, the air stale with the smell of sweat, oil, and gunmetal.

Yusuf—20 years old, 5'10"", with tousled black hair, sharp brown eyes, and fair skin—sat beside Tron, his elbow brushing against his in quiet solidarity. He was more than just a teammate; he was Tron’s closest friend. The two had bled, trained, and survived together, forging a bond stronger than most families ever knew.

Yusuf: “You good, man?”

Tron: “Just tired.”

Yusuf: “Bullshit. You’re nervous.”

Tron: “Maybe. Doesn’t matter.”

Yusuf: “You’re the top guy, bro. Just don’t die before me.”

Evan (from across the vehicle): “He won’t. I trained him better than that.”

They all laughed. Nervous. Hollow.


---

Beyond the Wall

The deep growl of diesel engines echoed through the cracked valley as the convoy rumbled across the broken highway. Thick tires crunched over shattered glass and rubble. Dust trailed behind the armored vehicles like a ghostly wake. Inside one of the lead trucks, Tron sat rigid, elbows on his knees, eyes fixed on the passing wasteland.

The sun burned low behind a veil of gray clouds, casting the land in an amber hue that made everything look older… deader. The wind howled through the remains of what was once a neighborhood—caved-in roofs, blackened window frames, rusted tricycles lying in the dirt like forgotten memories.

The stench of diesel mixed with mildew and rot. It crept in through the vents. Tron's nostrils flared slightly. He didn’t mind the smell anymore. You got used to everything in this world—blood, fire, the stink of corpses. Eventually, it all became background noise.

Evan sat across from him, arms crossed over his tactical vest, eyes calm but alert. His fingers tapped slowly against the butt of his rifle, the rhythm steady, almost meditative.

Evan: “What are you thinking when you look at those buildings?”

Tron didn’t answer at first. He watched a leafless tree sway in the wind, its branches clawing at the sky like it was begging for something that would never come.

Tron: “I was thinking that people used to live in those places. Maybe kids played in those yards. Maybe families fought over dinner and made up by bedtime… Now they’re just filled with mindless monsters.”

Evan nodded, his jaw tightening.

Evan: “Yeah, that’s the sad truth. We can never know when things will change. Everything—everyone—can change in an instant.”

Tron: “Hard to believe it’s been fifteen years since the outbreak. Feels like just yesterday I was watching cartoons, eating cereal on the floor…”

Evan: “Time flies, kid. Especially when you’re running from the dead.”

The vehicle lurched slightly as they hit a patch of uneven road. The metal frame groaned under its own weight. Ahead, the wall of the Genshain safe zone loomed—tall, grim, armored with decades of fear. Rust streaked the steel, bullet marks pitted the surface like battle scars.

Then, without warning, the sky cracked.

A deafening explosion tore through the air from somewhere beyond the gates—followed by a shockwave that rattled the vehicle’s frame and sent a plume of smoke curling upward into the clouds. The ground vibrated beneath their boots, and for a second, everyone inside froze.

The air inside the truck turned sharp, electric, like the moment before lightning strikes.

Tron: “What the hell was that?!”

Evan: snatching his helmet off the hook, eyes narrowing “Breach… Brace yourselves!”

Alarms began blaring from the watchtowers. A red strobe light flickered on and off, painting the interior of the vehicle with blood-colored flashes. Men reached for rifles. Fingers fumbled for straps. Adrenaline surged like a current.

The wall had been breached.

And whatever was coming through it—they weren’t human.

---

Two Hours Ago – Watchtower

Two soldiers stood atop the wall of the Genshain Safe Zone, their rifles slung lazily across their shoulders as they scanned the endless, dead horizon. The midday sun beat down harshly, making the concrete beneath their boots radiate a dry, searing heat. The air was still—unnaturally still. No wind, no birds, no movement. Just the faint, ever-present smell of rusted metal, old blood, and dust.

Logan: ""Hey, Mike. I brought burgers—figured we might as well enjoy something.""

He tossed a foil-wrapped lump to his friend. The greasy scent of reheated beef and onions broke the monotony of dead air.

Mike (catching it with one hand): ""Thanks. You know, it's boring as hell up here. Just standing and watching all day.""

He unwrapped the burger and took a bite, the bread already a bit stale, but it was food—real food. His jaw moved slowly as he chewed, eyes scanning the empty wasteland for something, anything.

Logan (grunting as he leaned against the railing): ""You're damn right. We're soldiers, not security guards babysitting concrete walls. We’re supposed to be out there fighting, not standing around with our dicks in our hands.""

Mike (smirking): ""Exactly. Do you really think it’s worth keeping watch like this?""

Logan (with a scoff): ""Hell no. This wall’s made of thick concrete with a steel core. Not a single breach since it was built. No way anything’s getting through.""

Mike: ""You’ve got a point.""

Then—a rumble. Faint at first, like a distant growl beneath the earth. They both stiffened. Dust trembled on the railing. Mike leaned forward, squinting toward the road.

Suddenly, they spotted them—several large trucks barreling toward the gate at full speed, engines howling like beasts. The sun glinted off their armored frames, the tires throwing up a cloud of dust in their wake.

Mike (grabbing his radio, voice tightening): ""Hey! Stop right there or we’ll open fire!""

His heart hammered in his chest. The burger dropped from his hand and hit the ground with a soft splat.

Logan (stepping up beside him, adrenaline kicking in): ""They’re not stopping. Screw this—we need to shoot now!""

Mike’s fingers fumbled on the radio as the sound of roaring engines grew louder—closer. Screams echoed from down below as soldiers scrambled to respond. Logan raised his rifle. The others along the wall followed.

Gunfire erupted. Muzzle flashes lit up the wall like fireworks in broad daylight. Bullets rained down on the speeding trucks—metal on metal, glass shattering, sparks flying. But nothing slowed them down.

The trucks slammed into the main gate—

BOOM!

A massive explosion tore through the air, a fiery shockwave hurling debris and flame in every direction. The blast punched through the wall like a goddamn sledgehammer. Concrete cracked and screamed as it split apart. A gaping hole yawned open in the barrier. Smoke and dust exploded into the sky.

The force of the blast threw Mike backward onto the concrete floor, his ears ringing, lungs choking on the acrid smoke. Blood trickled from a cut on his forehead. His burger, now smeared with dust and gravel, lay forgotten beside him.

Alarms began to wail—shrill, relentless, piercing through the smoke.

Mike (dragging the radio to his mouth, coughing violently): ""Sir! The wall’s been breached!""

Chaos erupted below. Shouts, running boots, gunfire—and from beyond the smoke, the rising, guttural screech of the infected.

Meanwhile – Holy Care Hospital

The dim fluorescent lights hummed quietly above as Mouri stood half-dressed in front of her cabinet, the chill of the metal locker brushing against her skin as she slipped into her nurse’s uniform. The sterile smell of disinfectant clung to the air—clean, sharp, but ever-so-slightly tinged with something metallic.

She adjusted the clasp on her bra and zipped up the white tunic when she heard approaching footsteps.

Vera, her colleague, appeared beside her, her face pale and slightly sunken with fatigue. She opened the locker next to Mouri’s with a metallic clang.

Mouri: “Hey, long time no see, Vera.”

Vera (sighing heavily): “Yeah… just rejoined today. Took two weeks off.”

Mouri: “Why? What happened?”

Vera (rubbing her tired eyes): “My son got really sick. He was vomiting blood.”

Mouri froze mid-motion, the shock sending a chill down her spine.

Mouri: “What? Are you serious?”

Vera: “Yeah… the doctors said a valve inside was cracked. Blood was leaking. They had to close it surgically.”

Mouri’s hands trembled slightly as she reached for her stethoscope.

Mouri: “Oh my god… I’m so sorry. Is he okay now?”

Vera: “He’s resting at home. I left him with my sister.”

Mouri (softly): “You did the right thing.”

The locker room fell into a brief silence. The hum of the building's AC felt louder now, like it was trying to fill in the space left by their fears.

Moments later, Vera turned toward her with a weak smile.

Vera: “Wanna hit the canteen? I’m half-asleep already.”

Mouri: “Yeah, a coffee sounds perfect. Let’s go.”

They walked side-by-side through the sterile hospital corridor, the rhythmic squeak of their shoes echoing across the white-tiled floor. Outside the building, the world felt quieter, more alive—the scent of roasted coffee beans hit them like a gentle embrace as they entered the canteen.

They sat with steaming cups in hand, chatting quietly, the ceramic mugs warm in their palms.

Then came the scream.

Piercing. Raw. Human.

Mouri jolted upright, her coffee sloshing over the rim and onto her lap—scalding her skin.

Mouri: “Oh fuck! How the hell did this happen?!”

People sprinted past the glass windows, their faces contorted with terror.

Vera: “I—I don’t know!”

Then they saw them.

Zombies.

Bodies twisted by decay, mouths agape, shrieking with unholy hunger as they lunged at civilians. The sound of tearing flesh and the wet crunch of bones filled the air outside.

Mouri: “We need to get back to the hospital—NOW!”

The undead saw them.

Adrenaline flooded their veins. They ran—heartbeats pounding like war drums, lungs burning with every breath.

They burst through the hospital entrance and slammed the doors shut behind them—BANG!—locking it with trembling hands.

Thuds. Snarls. Scratches.

The glass rattled violently.

Vera stood frozen, eyes wide, shoulders shaking uncontrollably. The scent of fear—sweat and panic—filled the lobby.

Mouri (grabbing Vera’s shoulders): “Vera. Hey—look at me. Calm down.”

Vera: “My son’s at home—with my sister! I don’t even know if they’re safe! How the hell am I supposed to calm down?!”

Mouri: “I know, I know. But right now, you have to stay calm.”

Vera shook her head, tears streaming down her face.

Vera: “I—I don’t know what to do…”

Mouri’s fingers fumbled for her phone. She tried Evan’s number. Then Tron’s.

No signal.

Only silence.

The hospital was no longer a place of healing.

It had become a tomb.


---

Present Time – Outside the Wall

The radio crackled violently, static spitting like angry sparks before Commander Ali’s voice tore through the noise.
Ali (on radio): “We’ve got a breach! The wall’s down. Zombies are pouring in. I need all of my soldiers back at the base immediately!”

The urgency in his voice was unmistakable—raw panic laced beneath the command.

The patrol team wasn’t far from the safe zone. Without hesitation, they sprinted back, boots thundering over gravel and blood-stained asphalt. The cool sting of the wind carried the unmistakable scent of smoke and death. Every breath tasted metallic, foul like rotting meat and burning oil.

Tron and Evan moved in sync, muscle memory guiding them, M4s clutched tight against their chests. The tranquility of their patrol shattered like glass—what had been quiet strategy a minute ago was now pure chaos.

Evan: “Stay in formation! Protect the civilians!”

His voice barked over the mayhem, cutting through the screams and shrieks that pierced the air like sirens.

Ahead of them, the towering wall—once their guardian, now just a broken monument—had become a gateway to hell. Its structure had collapsed inwards, and from that gaping hole surged a mass of the undead. Dozens at first, then hundreds, spilling forward like liquid death. Their rotting skin peeled in slick ribbons, their eyes glowing with blind hunger. Some crawled over the broken concrete. Others simply leapt, their limbs contorted and twitching unnaturally.

Tron’s boots skidded to a stop as his stomach turned from the overwhelming stench—sour flesh, decaying entrails, gunpowder, blood, and the acrid scent of fear.

Tron: “They’re not stopping…”

Evan: “No. We’re not either.”

Gunfire answered.
A storm of noise erupted—blasts so loud they vibrated in their bones. The staccato rhythm of M4 rifles, the thuds of shotgun pumps, the occasional scream that ended abruptly, always abruptly. Blood sprayed across stone, and bodies—human and inhuman—fell alike.

Zombies shrieked as bullets tore through their skulls. One collapsed in front of Tron, its jaw still snapping, its tongue twitching between broken teeth. But for each one that dropped, three more climbed over it, clawing forward.

The soldiers moved like wolves in a storm—coordinated, focused, desperate. Their training took over, but this wasn’t a mission. This was survival.

Ali (on radio): “We need backup—now! Get the civilians to safety! Hold the line until reinforcements arrive!”

The panic in his voice wasn’t masked anymore. Even through the static, it rattled.

Tron and Evan exchanged a look—no words, just the fire of shared resolve. Years of pain, war, love, and survival passed between them in one silent second.

Tron: “Let’s finish this.”
Evan: “Together.”


---

At the AOE Base

The convoy burst onto the scene—and instantly, all hope died in their throats.

The base was gone.

The outer walls had been ripped apart. Zombies overran the compound like insects over meat. Fires raged in several sectors, smoke curling upward in greasy, black pillars. Gunfire rang out in the distance—sporadic and frantic—each shot a cry for help.

The scene was pure carnage. Civilians screamed as they were dragged down. Some soldiers fired in circles, surrounded. Others had already turned—uniforms shredded, eyes vacant, jaws twitching with hunger.

The scent hit them first—overpowering and dense. Blood. Piss. Burnt flesh. It coated their nostrils like tar, made their eyes sting.

Yusuf: “We need to move, NOW!”

They didn’t wait. They opened fire, grenades flung like desperate prayers.
Boom! Boom! BOOM!
The ground shook. Limbs flew. A few zombies turned into steaming chunks—but the rest didn’t care. They kept coming, climbing over the bodies of their own.

Out of 50 soldiers who’d been out on patrol, less than a dozen had made it back.

The rest were dead... or worse.


---

The Command Center

The command center was a cathedral of carnage. The flickering lights overhead stuttered like a dying heartbeat, casting erratic shadows across the blood-soaked floor. The air was thick with rot, gunpowder, and a coppery tang of fresh blood that clung to the throat like rusted nails. Bodies—some twitching, others grotesquely still—littered the hallway. Limbs twisted at unnatural angles. Eyes rolled back. Jawbones snapped mid-spasm.

The shrill screams of the dying echoed through the corridors, merging with the wet snarls of the undead. It was hell, alive and breathing.

Tron and Evan moved like shadows in the chaos, rifles raised, boots squelching with every step on the sticky crimson floor. The hall reeked of death—burnt flesh, gun oil, vomit. Every breath was a punishment.

They passed by a half-eaten soldier—his face chewed off, throat torn open, his stomach still heaving in its final spasms. Another man was pinned beneath a broken console, his trembling fingers still gripping his sidearm, too late to use it.

A woman in civilian clothing screamed for help down the corridor, but the next moment, her voice turned into a gurgle as a ghoul ripped into her throat. Blood splattered across the walls.

Tron’s hands were steady despite the storm inside his chest. His boots crunched over shattered glass and shell casings as he moved room to room, clearing with mechanical precision. The undead met his bullets with bone-cracking snaps and geysers of dark blood. Evan was at his side, his eyes hard and unflinching. This wasn’t their first slaughter.

But Commander Ali… he was nowhere to be found.

Tron: “We need to check his office.”

Tron’s hand wrapped around the cold steel handle of the office door. As he cracked it open, the smell hit him first—musty sweat, blood, and something sour. The shadows inside shifted.

Growls. Then—a sudden blur.

Three zombies lunged from the darkness, their shrieks tearing through the air.

Tron: “Shit!”

BANG. BANG.

He shot the first two down without hesitation, but the third got too close. Click. Click. He was out of ammo. The zombie lunged for his throat, teeth bared, ready to tear him apart.

Tron’s breath hitched. His heart slammed against his ribs. The third zombie was already airborne, its rotting jaws aimed for his neck.

Then—

“No!”
Evan shoved him hard, knocking Tron to the ground. The impact rattled his bones, the floor unforgiving beneath him.

The zombie's teeth sank into Evan’s forearm with a sickening crunch. Blood sprayed. Evan screamed—a raw, animal sound—as he grappled with the snarling creature.

Tron didn’t hesitate.

His hand flew to his belt. The combat knife gleamed, and with one savage motion, he plunged it into the zombie’s temple. It shuddered, jerked once, then collapsed like a puppet with its strings cut.

Tron: “Dad! No, no, no...”

Evan dropped to his knees. Blood poured down his arm, painting his sleeve in deep scarlet. His skin had already begun to pale. He held the wound with trembling fingers, but the bite was deep—filthy teeth had torn muscle and tendon.

Evan (gritting his teeth): “I’m fine… just a scratch.”

Bullshit. They both knew it.

Tron (desperately): “You need to sit. We’ll find a medic.”

Evan’s breath came shallow. He leaned back against the cold concrete wall, sweat pouring down his temples despite the icy chill in the room. He looked at the wound, then at Tron—and said nothing.

Then—a hiss of hydraulics.

From a hidden panel behind a bookshelf, a door slid open.

Commander Ali stepped out, Glock 17 in hand, eyes wide, beard soaked with sweat.

Ali: “Tron… Evan… I thought I lost you both.”

Three soldiers followed him, weapons drawn, eyes darting.

But the moment froze as Ali’s gaze locked with Tron's.

Tron (staggering forward): “Dad…”

The room turned to ice.

Evan lowered his head. The truth had finally landed.

Evan (biting through the pain): “They got me on my arm… Ah, fuck.”

Tron moved to him, his hands bloody, trembling.

Tron: “You’re gonna be okay. We’ll— we’ll figure something out. Just hold pressure.”

Evan (whispering): “No. We know how this ends…”

Tron’s throat closed. Tears welled behind his lashes, spilling down his dirt-streaked face. Every second was a weight pressing down on him.

Tron (crumbling): “No, I don’t. Don’t say that. You’re gonna be fine.”

Ali: “Tron, you know what we have to do.”

Tron (snapping): “No! We can’t!”

Soldier 1: “We need to shoot him before he turns—”

Tron (snarling): “Shut the fuck up!”

Soldier 2 (softly): “It’s mercy, Tron… not cruelty.”

Tron turned back to Evan. The man who had raised him. Protected him. Loved him when no one else did.

Tron: “Dad, I can’t… I can’t lose you. Please. Don’t make me do this.”

Evan’s hand, still trembling, reached up to touch Tron’s face. His calloused palm was warm—too warm. Fever already setting in.

Evan: “You have to. This… this is how it ends, Tron. We all walk alone eventually. Even me.”

Tron (whimpering): “Don’t say it like that…”

Evan: “Listen to me. You gotta do two things, alright?”

Tron nodded through the tears.

Evan: “One… you put a bullet in my head before I turn. I want it to be you.”

Tron’s breath hitched. The Glock in his holster felt like a burning brand.

Evan: “Two… you take care of your mom. She needs you.”

Tron (voice breaking): “Okay… I’ll do it.”

He embraced Evan. Tight. Desperate. The man’s blood seeped through Tron’s uniform, hot and sticky. His body shook against him, each sob from Tron cutting into the air like a blade.

Evan (barely audible): “I’m proud of you. Always have been.”

Tron pulled back, tears blinding him. His hands moved with mechanical slowness, drawing the Glock.

Tron (whispering): “I love you, Dad.”

Evan (smiling faintly): “I love you too, son.”

BANG.

The shot echoed like a thunderclap. Evan’s head snapped back, and he slumped lifelessly to the side, blood pooling beneath him.

Silence followed.

A silence that screamed louder than any gunfire.

Ali: “Tron… you did what you had to do. But we have to move. Civilians need extraction. Transports are waiting.”

Tron stood, dazed. The Glock fell from his hand. His limbs were heavy. His heart—a crater in his chest.

Ali (sharper): “Tron!”

Yusuf (stepping in): “He’s right. We need to save the others. Now.”

Tron clenched his jaw. He wiped his face with a bloodied sleeve. The grief didn’t fade—it anchored him. But behind it burned a purpose.

He picked up his rifle, checked the magazine, and chambered a round with a hard click.

Tron (hoarse): “Let’s finish this.”

Together, the soldiers moved out, their boots pounding through the halls as they pushed toward the evacuation bay—toward the final stand.

No more hesitation.

No more time.

Only war.

Harsh: “Mumbai ka hoon. Waise tu real mein bhi itna seedha-saadha hai jitna profile pic mein lagta hai, ya yeh sirf innocent-boy-wale likes ke liye drama hai?”

Rajat ki aankhen thodi fail gayi. Drama? Really?
Rajat: “Agar kisi ka decent hona drama lagta hai, toh shayad tum wrong app pe ho.”

Harsh: “Oho! Touchy point hit kar diya kya?”
Ek winking emoji bhi bhej diya usne.

Rajat ne phone table pe patak diya. “Kya attitude hai bhai ka!” Dimaag mein thoda gussa ubalne laga. Ye banda typical flirt hai jo sabko timepass samajhta hai.

5 minute tak usne kuch nahi likha. Silence.

Phir ek message aaya.
Harsh: “Aree sorry yaar, thoda mazaak mein keh diya. Tumhara reply dekh ke laga tum genuine ho, isiliye thoda pull kar liya. Mera tareeka thoda ajeeb hai, par bura nahi hoon.”

Thoda aur ruk ke, ek aur message:
Harsh: “Peace? Ek coffee pe chill karte hain. No drama. No pressure. Promise.”

Rajat ka gussa thoda pighla. Usne socha, “Itna toh deserve karta hai ek chance…”

Aur phir type kiya:
“Thik hai. Kab aur kahan?”

Aur Harsh ka turant reply:
“Kal evening. Main pick karne bhi aa jaaun kya, Mr. Seedhe-Saade?”

Rajat ki lips pe ek chhoti si smile aayi. Kya kar baitha hoon? par dil ne kahaa… “Chal, dekhte hain.”

 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern club chair cover boasts a variety of features designed to enhance functionality, aesthetics, and durability. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the ideal cover for your specific needs.

**Fabric Quality:** The fabric is the first line of defense against wear and tear. High-quality covers utilize materials like polyester blends with spandex for stretch, or natural fabrics like cotton and linen for comfort and breathability. Premium options often include stain-resistant and waterproof treatments to protect against spills and accidents. The weight of the fabric, measured in GSM (grams per square meter), also indicates its thickness and durability, with higher GSM values generally signifying a more robust and long-lasting cover.

**Stretch and Fit:** A well-fitting cover is essential for a polished look. Covers with high stretch capabilities, often achieved through spandex or elastane blends, conform to the unique contours of a club chair, providing a snug and seamless appearance. Some covers feature adjustable straps or elastic hems to further customize the fit and prevent slippage. Universal fit covers are designed to accommodate a wide range of chair sizes, while custom-made options offer the most precise and tailored fit.

**Design and Style:** Club chair covers are available in a vast array of colors, patterns, and textures to suit any d茅cor. From solid neutrals to bold prints, the design options are virtually limitless. Consider the existing color palette and style of your living space when choosing a cover to ensure a cohesive and harmonious look. Textured fabrics, such as velvet or faux suede, can add depth and sophistication, while simpler designs offer a clean and minimalist aesthetic.

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance:** A user-friendly design is paramount for hassle-free installation and removal. Many covers feature simple slip-on designs with clear instructions. Machine-washable fabrics are highly desirable for easy cleaning and maintenance. Consider covers that are wrinkle-resistant to minimize the need for ironing and maintain a neat appearance.

**Protection and Durability:** The primary function of a club chair cover is to protect the underlying furniture from stains, spills, scratches, and fading. Look for covers made from durable materials that can withstand regular use and cleaning. Reinforced seams and robust construction contribute to the overall longevity of the cover. Waterproof or stain-resistant treatments provide an added layer of protection against accidents.

**Additional Features:** Some club chair covers offer additional features such as pockets for storing remote controls or magazines, or separate cushion covers for added flexibility. These features can enhance the functionality and convenience of the cover, making it a more practical and versatile addition to your living space.

Key features of the best club chair covers include:
    * Durable and stain-resistant fabrics
    * Excellent stretch and customizability
    * A wide range of design options
    * Easy installation and maintenance
    * Robust protection against wear and tear
    * Additional convenience features

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality club chair cover offers a multitude of benefits, ranging from aesthetic enhancements to practical protection. Understanding these benefits can help you appreciate the value of a good cover.

**Furniture Protection:** A club chair cover acts as a shield, protecting your valuable furniture from the inevitable wear and tear of daily life. It safeguards against spills, stains, pet hair, scratches, and fading caused by sunlight. This protection extends the lifespan of your chair, saving you money in the long run by delaying the need for reupholstering or replacement.

**Style Transformation:** A new cover can instantly transform the look of your club chair and, by extension, your entire living space. It allows you to experiment with different colors, patterns, and textures without the commitment of purchasing new furniture. This provides a cost-effective way to refresh your d茅cor and keep your living room looking stylish and up-to-date.

**Easy Maintenance:** Cleaning a club chair cover is far easier than cleaning the chair itself. Most covers are machine-washable, allowing you to quickly remove spills and stains without having to resort to professional cleaning services. This simplifies maintenance and ensures that your chair always looks its best.

**Cost Savings:** Investing in a club chair cover is significantly cheaper than reupholstering or replacing your chair. It provides a practical and affordable way to protect and refresh your furniture, saving you money in the long run.

**Pet-Friendly Solution:** Club chair covers are a great way to protect your furniture from pet hair, scratches, and accidents. Many covers are designed with pet-friendly materials that are easy to clean and resistant to damage. This allows you to enjoy your furniture without worrying about the potential for pet-related messes.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about club chair covers before making a purchase. Here are some common questions and their answers.

**Will a universal fit cover actually fit my oddly shaped club chair?**
   Universal fit covers are designed with stretchable fabrics and adjustable straps to accommodate a wide range of chair shapes and sizes. While they may not provide a perfectly tailored fit like a custom-made cover, they can often provide a snug and presentable appearance for irregularly shaped chairs. Measure your chair carefully and compare it to the cover's dimensions to ensure the best possible fit.

**Are stain-resistant covers truly effective against all types of spills?**
   Stain-resistant covers are treated with special coatings that repel liquids and prevent stains from setting in. While they are effective against many common spills, such as water, juice, and coffee, they may not be completely impervious to all types of stains, particularly those caused by oil-based substances or strong dyes. It is still important to clean up spills promptly to prevent permanent staining.

**How do I prevent my club chair cover from slipping off the chair?**
   Several factors can contribute to a cover slipping off a chair, including improper fit, smooth fabric, and frequent use. To prevent slippage, choose a cover with adjustable straps or elastic hems to secure it in place. You can also use furniture tacks or non-slip pads to provide additional grip. Regularly readjusting the cover can also help to maintain a snug fit.

**Can I use a club chair cover on an outdoor chair?**
   While some club chair covers may be suitable for limited outdoor use, it is generally not recommended to use them on chairs that are exposed to direct sunlight, rain, or other harsh weather conditions. Outdoor fabrics are specifically designed to withstand these elements, while indoor fabrics may fade, deteriorate, or develop mold and mildew if exposed to the outdoors for extended periods. Look for covers specifically designed for outdoor use if you need to protect your outdoor furniture.

 ## Competitor Comparison

The market for club chair covers is competitive, with numerous brands offering a wide range of products. Here's a comparison of three popular options.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Main Product: Deluxe Stretch Club Chair Cover
    * **Fabric:** High-quality polyester blend with spandex for exceptional stretch and durability.
    * **Fit:** Universal fit with adjustable straps and elastic hem for a secure and customizable fit.

    * **Fabric:** 100% cotton for a soft and breathable feel.
    * **Fit:** Standard fit with ties for securing the cover in place.
    * **Style:** Limited selection of traditional patterns and solid colors.

### Key Differences Summary

The Deluxe Stretch Club Chair Cover excels in its combination of stretch, durability, and style options, making it a versatile choice for most users. The Classic Cotton Club Chair Slipcover offers a more traditional aesthetic with its natural cotton fabric, but it lacks the stretch and adjustability of the Deluxe Stretch option.

If it’s the middle of the night and she asks for food I will give her a very low effort snack (apple slices, cheezits, yogurt drops) but she doesn’t get any fun things like TV or her coloring books. More often than not she eats about half her snack and is ready to go back to bed. 

Her dad (my fiance) has always been bad with night wakings but this weeks has been a huge downturn in his attitude about them. My 2yo has not been feeling great all week, had a high fever the other night and while that’s cleared up she’s still feeling crummy and has some residual issues like a messed up sleep schedule and slowly wanting to actually eat food again. She woke up around 2:45, her dad got really aggravated that I wasn’t getting out of bed fast enough to “shut her up”. When I get down to her room she was asking for another sippy cup so I gave her one, tucked her back in, and unfortunately she didn’t go back to bed. She’s crying again and I go back in to check on her and she starts saying she’s hungry and gets up and goes to her bedroom door. I’m just happy she’s wanting food again and she ran straight to her high chair. She had a bit more fussing over her snack choices and not getting the TV turned on, causing her dad to scream down the stairs “shut up” and scaring her. I got her calmed down, she ate a single cheez it, and asked to go back to bed. She’s tucked in bed trying to get back to sleep when her dad comes stomping down the stairs and shouting at me about how “it’s not healthy to let her eat whenever she wants” and “she’s manipulating you”. I told him I set my standard a long time ago that I will always give her the chance to eat. He then shifts to “I’m not the bad guy for wanting to sleep”, “we are the parents and shes going to suffer if you aren’t harsher on her” and “I’m not evil for wanting to keep my kid on a schedule”, which isn’t anything related to what I had said. He tried convincing me that her metabolism was “off” for the night and it was extremely bad for her health to eat after 9pm. He eventually stormed off upstairs once I went back into my daughter’s room because his shouting kept her up and she started crying again. It’s almost 5 and I’ve just got her tucked back into bed (turns out she had a huge poo brewing)

He had a freak out on Monday about her being up and down all night, he was slamming doors and stomping and yelling upstairs but not actually picking a fight with me. Turned out she had a 102 fever that kept her up, and he only seemed regretful when him yelling lead to me not making his coffee in the morning. 

He’s always been temperamental but I’m losing my patience and getting more and more concerned with his behavior as we’re expecting a second child. I hate that I’m staying up because I’m in fight or flight about protecting my daughter. Everything she does “wrong” (aka being a normal fucking toddler) is ALWAYS blamed on me. Im just fucking tired of living like this (sorry this turned into a rant here at the end)

1k7gvcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1k7gvcy/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.

# The Secret to a Healthier, Happier You

For me, the best part about MITOLYN is how it doesn’t just focus on one part of your health. It’s like a best friend for your whole body and mind. I used to think that taking just one vitamin or eating a salad a day would be enough, but MITOLYN goes way beyond that. It’s designed to help you feel good all the way from your head to your toes.

The secret behind MITOLYN is how it works with your body. Instead of just giving you a quick burst of energy and then leaving you tired later, this supplement helps your body keep going strong all day long. I noticed that I started waking up feeling refreshed, and my mood was brighter throughout the day. It even helped me focus better at school and stay calm when things got stressful.

# Powerful Ingredients for Maximum Results

One thing I always check with any supplement is what’s actually inside it. MITOLYN really impressed me here. The people who made MITOLYN picked each ingredient for a reason—they all help your body in different, important ways. Here’s a closer look at some of the powerful ingredients you’ll find in every bottle:

- **Ginseng Root**: This is like a super fuel for your brain and body. Ginseng helped me feel more awake and alert, especially on days when I stayed up late. It’s known for helping people focus and making you feel less tired, even during long days of work or study.

- **Turmeric**: I’ve always heard that turmeric is great for fighting off aches and pains, but I didn’t realize how much it could help with swelling and keeping my joints healthy. It’s packed with antioxidants, which means it helps protect your body from things that can harm your cells.

- **Vitamin D3**: Living somewhere that’s cloudy a lot, I know how easy it is to not get enough Vitamin D. This vitamin keeps your immune system strong and helps you feel happier. I found that I got sick less often after I started taking MITOLYN.

- **Ashwagandha**: Stress used to get the better of me, but ashwagandha really helped me stay calm, even when things got busy. It’s what’s called an “adaptogen,” which means it helps your body handle stress better.

Along with these, MITOLYN also includes other helpful herbs, vitamins, and minerals. Together, they make a team that supports your body in many different ways.

# Why MITOLYN is a Game-Changer for Your Health

When I first tried MITOLYN, I was hoping for more energy. But I got so much more than that. Here are a few ways MITOLYN changed things for me and why so many people are calling it a game-changer:

- **Long-Lasting Energy & Focus**: With MITOLYN, I noticed I could get through my day without feeling drained. The best part? There were no jitters or crashes like you get from coffee or sugary snacks. I could pay attention in class and still have energy for soccer practice in the evening.

- **Deeper, More Restful Sleep**: Before, I would toss and turn at night, but MITOLYN helped me relax and fall asleep faster. I woke up actually feeling rested, which made my mornings so much better.

- **Stronger Immunity**: Getting sick less often is a huge win for anyone. With the boost from Vitamin D3 and other nutrients, I felt like my body could fight off colds and bugs much better.

- **Sharper Mind & Calmer Mood**: School and life can be stressful, but MITOLYN helped me stay cool even when things got tough. I felt less anxious and more positive. My memory and focus also improved, which made studying a lot easier.

- **Full-Body Wellness**: MITOLYN isn’t just about one part of your health—it’s about feeling better all over, inside and out. From your heart to your brain, and even your bones and joints, MITOLYN helps you feel like your best self.

# MITOLYN's Growing Popularity in the USA and UK

It’s not just me who’s noticed how awesome MITOLYN is. People all over the USA and UK are talking about it, and it’s easy to see why. With more people looking for natural ways to stay healthy, MITOLYN fits perfectly. I’ve read tons of stories from people who say they now have more energy to play with their kids, focus at work, or just enjoy life more.

Even my friends who usually don’t try supplements have started asking about MITOLYN. It’s become a popular choice because it’s safe, natural, and actually works. Whether you’re an athlete, a busy parent, or someone just wanting to feel better every day, people from all walks of life are loving MITOLYN.

I know those “I’m bored, let’s be friends!” posts are everywhere, and I usually roll my eyes too… but here I am, eating my words and hoping to find someone cool to vibe with. That said, boredom aside, I’m genuinely looking for meaningful, long-term platonic friendships. Not just quick chats or passing time—I want that comfy, consistent connection where we actually enjoy being part of each other’s day.

Eventually, I’d love to move to Discord, hang out while you game (I’m not a gamer, but I adore watching and cheering people on like their personal hype squad), and just chill over voice calls. Daily audio chats? Yes please. I’ve always felt more “me” talking than texting.

I’m a coffee girl through and through—especially iced orange americano. I pretend I don’t like lattes, but pistachio and this recent butter latte totally have me in a chokehold. I’m also obsessed with Japanese fluffy pancakes—the ones with fresh cream and fruit that feel like biting into a cloud. I love anime and anything animated, and bookstores feel sacred to me. I don’t have a cat yet, but I daydream about it often—mostly about hugging it until it files a (loving) restraining order. And yes, I totally relax with ASMR spa and hair treatment videos. Bliss.

I’d love to connect with people 29 and up who are open to building something easygoing and real over time. If you’re a little weird (in the best way), even better. Let’s bring back classic ASL intros, and tell me a bit about yourself—what makes you feel cozy, curious, or creatively alive?

# My Struggle with Exhaustion and Mental Fog

Let me tell you, feeling tired all the time is no fun. I used to wake up in the morning already exhausted. It didn’t matter if I got eight hours of sleep or even more—I’d still feel like I could crawl right back into bed. My head felt heavy, and my thoughts were slow, like trying to walk through thick mud. At work, I found myself staring at my computer screen, forgetting what I was supposed to do. Even simple conversations were hard to follow sometimes.

I tried so many things to fix this. I started eating more fruits and vegetables, cut back on sugar, and did my best to exercise regularly. I even tried different vitamins and other supplements, hoping they’d give me a boost. But the tiredness and brain fog just wouldn’t go away. It got to the point where I thought maybe this was just how life was going to be as I got older. I felt stuck and a little hopeless.

Then one day, a friend told me about MITOLYN. They said it worked wonders for them, so I decided to give it a shot. I figured I had nothing to lose.

# The First Impressions of MITOLYN

When I first got my hands on MITOLYN, I was pretty excited but also a little skeptical. I read up on what made it special. MITOLYN is made to help your mitochondria—the tiny “power plants” inside your cells that make energy. That sounded interesting to me, because it meant it was working right at the source of all my tiredness.

What caught my eye was the ingredient list. I recognized things like CoQ10 and Acetyl-L-Carnitine, which I’d heard were good for energy. There were no weird chemicals or artificial colors, just clean, natural ingredients. That made me feel pretty good about trying it out. I started taking MITOLYN every day, hoping for the best.

# Week 1: Subtle But Positive Changes

The first week, I was keeping my expectations low. I didn’t expect to turn into a superhero overnight! But I did notice a couple of things. First, I wasn’t as groggy in the mornings. Waking up was still hard, but I didn’t feel like a total zombie. I also noticed that my mind was a little clearer, especially when I needed to get things done at work.

It wasn’t a huge change, but it was enough that I wanted to keep going. I noticed that I didn’t need as much coffee to get through the day, which was a big deal for me. I even caught myself smiling more, just because I felt a little better.

# Week 2: Increased Energy and Less Mental Fog

By the second week, things started to ramp up. I felt a stronger, steady kind of energy that lasted all day. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons like I usually did. My brain fog was lifting—I could focus on my work, remember names, and follow conversations without zoning out.

Another surprise was how much better I was sleeping. Before MITOLYN, I’d toss and turn all night. Now, I was falling asleep faster and waking up feeling more refreshed. It was like my body was finally getting the rest it needed. Even little things, like getting up to make breakfast or taking a walk, felt easier.

# Week 3: Transformation in My Daily Life

By week three, the changes were impossible to ignore. My energy was way up. I actually looked forward to getting things done, whether it was chores around the house or working on big projects at my job. My mind felt sharper than it had in years. I could remember things better, make quicker decisions, and stay focused for longer stretches.

But the best part was how I felt emotionally. When you’re not tired all the time, everything seems brighter. I felt more cheerful and confident, like I could handle whatever the day threw at me. Even my friends and family noticed that I was more positive and energetic.

MITOLYN didn’t just give me a little boost—it totally changed my daily life. I felt like myself again, but even better.

# The Science Behind MITOLYN: Why It Works

So, why does MITOLYN work so well? It’s all about helping your mitochondria do their job. The mitochondria are like tiny batteries in every cell, creating the energy your body and brain need. When they’re not working well, you feel tired and slow.

MITOLYN has a smart combination of ingredients:

- **CoQ10**: This helps your cells make energy and protects them from stress.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**: This supports your brain and helps you think more clearly.
- **PQQ**: This helps your body make new mitochondria, so you get more energy factories!
- **NAD+ Boosters**: These help your body keep making energy as you get older.

All these ingredients work together to boost your energy from the inside out. They don’t just hide your tiredness—they help fix the problem at its source. That’s why MITOLYN feels different from anything else I’ve tried.

# Why You Should Try MITOLYN

If you’re tired of being tired, I really think you should give MITOLYN a try. It’s made a huge difference for me, and I wish I’d found it sooner. Whether you’re dealing with stress, not sleeping well, or just feeling like you’ve lost your spark, MITOLYN can help you get your energy and focus back.

You don’t have to keep reaching for energy drinks or cups of coffee all day. With MITOLYN, your body starts to feel good naturally—no more jitters, crashes, or fake energy. It’s a gentle, steady feeling that lets you enjoy your life again.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I found MITOLYN, my days felt like a struggle. I was always tired, no matter how much I slept. I’d wake up groggy, and by the afternoon, I was ready for a nap. My brain felt slow, and I couldn’t focus on my work or even enjoy time with my family. I tried drinking more coffee, eating healthier, and even taking other supplements, but nothing made a big difference. I started to think that maybe this was just how life was going to be.

But then, after reading a few honest-sounding reviews online, I started to wonder if MITOLYN could actually help. People talked about feeling more energetic, thinking more clearly, and just being happier overall. I thought, “Why not? I’ve tried everything else.” So, I ordered a bottle and waited to see what would happen.

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was impressed right away. The box felt sturdy, and the design was clean and modern. It didn’t look cheap, and it made me feel like I’d bought something special. Inside, the instructions were clear and simple, so I knew exactly how to get started.

I liked that the ingredients list was easy to understand—no weird chemicals or stuff I’d never heard of. Everything looked natural and safe. That made me feel confident about trying it. Sometimes with new products, you can be nervous about what you’re putting in your body, but MITOLYN made everything straightforward.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I honestly wasn’t expecting anything to happen right away, but after just a few days, I started to notice changes. I woke up feeling more rested, and I actually wanted to get out of bed. My mind felt sharper, and I could focus on my work without getting distracted every five minutes.

One of the biggest surprises was how steady my energy became. Usually, I’d have a burst of energy in the morning and then crash in the afternoon. With MITOLYN, I felt good all day long. I didn’t need extra coffee or sugary snacks to keep going. It was like my body and brain finally got the boost they needed.

I stopped using my other supplements just to see if MITOLYN was really working—and the results stayed the same. That’s when I knew it wasn’t just my imagination.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are a few big reasons why I think MITOLYN is different from everything else I’ve tried:

- **Top Quality Ingredients:** Every capsule is packed with natural stuff that I can actually pronounce. No fillers or junk.
- **Real Results:** I didn’t just feel a little better—I felt a LOT better, and other people noticed too.
- **Safe and Gentle:** I never had any weird side effects or stomach problems. It just made me feel better, safely.
- **Good Value:** It’s not the cheapest supplement out there, but it does more than all the others I tried put together. I’m actually saving money because I don’t need to buy other things anymore.
- **So Many Happy Customers:** Reading through reviews, I saw that I wasn’t the only one having a great experience. That made me feel even more confident in my choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts was how quickly my friends and family saw the change in me. My partner asked why I seemed so happy and full of energy. My coworkers wanted to know what my secret was because I was getting so much done and always had a smile on my face.

I started telling people about MITOLYN, and a few of them decided to try it too. Every single person came back and said they felt the same way—more energy, better mood, and just a more positive outlook on life. I loved seeing other people feel better, just like I did.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had a small problem with my order (the shipping took a little longer than expected), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer service. I was ready for a headache, but instead, I got a friendly reply within a few hours. They took care of my issue quickly and even checked in later to make sure I was happy.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a person, not just a sale. MITOLYN’s team made me feel important and taken care of, and that honestly made me trust the brand even more.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt—yes! I recommend MITOLYN to anyone who feels tired, unfocused, or just not like themselves. It made such a difference in my life that I can’t help but tell everyone about it. I’ve shared it with my family, posted about it online, and even convinced a few skeptical friends to try it.

If you’re still not sure, my advice is to just give it a try. The worst that can happen is you feel the same, but the best that can happen is you feel better than you have in years.

# Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

Looking back, I’m so glad I decided to try MITOLYN. It didn’t just help my energy and focus—it gave me back my excitement for life. I feel more productive, more positive, and more like myself than I have in a long time.

It’s not often that you find something that really delivers on its promises, but for me, MITOLYN did exactly that. If you’re tired of feeling tired, or just want to feel your best, I say go for it. You might just look back and realize it was the best decision you made all year.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, I felt tired almost all the time. No matter how much sleep I got or how healthy I tried to eat, my energy would just disappear halfway through the day. It wasn’t just feeling sleepy—my mind was foggy, I struggled to keep up with my work, and sometimes I even forgot simple things, like where I left my keys or what I came into a room to do. I tried everything: drinking more water, cutting out sugar, taking long walks, and even a few of those “superfood” powders that tasted like grass. But nothing lasted. The tiredness always came back.

Then, as I was scrolling online, I spotted MITOLYN. I read story after story from people saying it changed their lives. Some said they felt like themselves again; others were finally able to get through a whole day without needing a nap. I was definitely skeptical, but I figured it was worth a try—after all, everything else hadn’t worked.

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

The day MITOLYN arrived, I felt a little rush of excitement. The box looked really nice—like something from a fancy store, not just a random product from the internet. It had clear instructions, and the packaging was clean and sturdy, not flimsy or cheap. Sometimes companies don’t even care about how things look, but with MITOLYN, I could tell they wanted me to have a good experience from the start.

I opened the bottle, checked out the capsules, and read the ingredients. Everything looked natural, and there weren’t any weird chemicals or fillers that I couldn’t pronounce. That made me feel safer about putting it in my body. The directions were easy, and I started my first dose that very day.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I’m not exaggerating when I say I noticed a difference within the first week. At first, I thought it might just be in my head, but each day, I felt a bit brighter. My morning brain fog started to lift, and I didn’t feel like collapsing on the couch by 2 p.m. My mood was better, and I could actually focus on my work without getting distracted every few minutes by my phone or random thoughts.

By the second week, I woke up before my alarm—something that never happened before! I didn’t have to drag myself out of bed, and I even started looking forward to my day. My family noticed I wasn’t as cranky in the evenings, and I still had enough energy to play board games with my little brother after dinner.

I kept waiting for the results to fade, but they didn’t. I stopped needing afternoon coffee and snacks just to keep going. MITOLYN became a part of my daily routine, and honestly, I couldn’t imagine going back to how things were before.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

So, what makes MITOLYN different from every other supplement or health product I’ve tried? Here’s what I found:

✅ **Top-Notch Ingredients**  
MITOLYN uses natural, high-quality ingredients. I did my research, and everything in the bottle is there for a reason—no random extras, no mystery chemicals.

✅ **Real Results You Can Feel**  
This isn’t one of those “maybe it’s working?” products. I noticed real changes in my energy, focus, and even my mood. And the changes stuck around.

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I never had a single side effect. No upset stomach, no headaches, nothing. I felt good taking it, which is more than I can say for a lot of other things I’ve tried.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
Some supplements are cheaper, sure. But they never did anything for me. MITOLYN might cost a little more, but I actually saved money because I stopped buying all those other “energy boosters” that didn’t work.

✅ **Thousands of Happy Customers**  
Knowing that other people had great experiences gave me confidence. I even joined a couple of online groups where people shared tips and cheered each other on—it felt good to be part of a community.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts was when my friends and family started asking what was different about me. My mom said I looked “glowier,” and my best friend asked if I’d started working out (I hadn’t). Even my boss mentioned that I seemed more focused and organized at work.

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to try it, too. And guess what? They had their own stories—my mom said her afternoon slumps disappeared, and my friend said she finally had the energy to clean her apartment after work.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had a small issue with my second order—the package got delayed. I sent an email to MITOLYN’s support team, expecting to wait days for a reply. But they got back to me within a couple of hours, apologized, and sent me a tracking update. They were super friendly and made me feel like my order actually mattered to them. It’s rare to get that kind of service these days, and it made me trust the company even more.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Definitely, yes! I’ve told my family, my friends, and now I’m sharing my story here. I don’t recommend things lightly, but MITOLYN really made a difference for me. If you’re tired of being tired, if you want more out of your day, or if you just want to feel like yourself again, then I say give MITOLYN a shot.

# Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

Looking back, I’m so glad I took a chance on MITOLYN. My days are brighter, my mind is clearer, and I actually have the energy for the things that matter most to me. It’s not just about feeling “okay” anymore—I feel good, and that’s worth everything.

If you’re on the fence, my advice is simple: try it for yourself. MITOLYN isn’t magic, but it’s the closest thing I’ve found to feeling like the best version of me. I’d do it all over again in a heartbeat.

# MITOLYN Changed My Life — And It Might Be the Best Investment You Ever Make in Your Health

I remember the first time I heard about MITOLYN. I was skeptical. I’d tried vitamins and “energy boosters” before, and none of them made much difference. But as I learned more about what makes us feel slow and exhausted as we age — and how MITOLYN worked at the tiniest level inside our cells — I got curious. I decided to give it a real shot, and I’m so glad I did.

Within a few weeks, my mornings were different. I woke up actually wanting to get out of bed. My mind felt clearer, and I had more patience for the ups and downs of the day. I started enjoying walks outside and cooking with my family again. The best part? I wasn’t just “getting by” anymore. I felt like life was open and full of possibilities again.

# The Daily Struggle Before MITOLYN

Before I tried MITOLYN, my days all felt the same: hard. No matter how early I went to bed, I woke up groggy and stiff. My back and knees ached. It took forever to get my brain going, and I’d lose focus after just a few minutes at work or reading with my kids. I forgot little things, too — like where I put my keys or what I was about to say. By afternoon, I’d need a nap or a giant cup of coffee just to keep moving.

Doctors told me everything looked “normal,” but I didn’t feel normal. I tried all sorts of supplements, but nothing brought back the energy and clear thinking I wanted. I started to worry that maybe I’d always feel this way.

Then I stumbled across some articles about mitochondrial health. I had never even heard the word “mitochondria” before, but once I learned that these tiny engines inside our cells were what powered everything — and that they slow down with age — it finally clicked. Maybe my body wasn’t broken; maybe it just needed better fuel.

# What Is MITOLYN? A Mitochondrial Miracle

MITOLYN isn’t like a regular vitamin or energy drink. It’s made to help the mitochondria — the tiny parts inside each cell that make energy out of food and oxygen. When mitochondria slow down or get damaged (from aging, stress, or pollution), you start to feel tired, achy, and foggy. MITOLYN is designed to wake them up and help them work better.

Here are some of the special ingredients inside MITOLYN:

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This helps your body make new mitochondria, so you have more energy factories working for you.
- **CoQ10:** Helps mitochondria create energy more efficiently, so you feel more lively.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine:** Gives your cells more fuel and helps clear away brain fog.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA):** Protects your cells from damage and helps repair them.
- **Magnesium and B-Complex:** These help turn food into energy and keep your nerves and muscles working well.

MITOLYN is like a tune-up for your body’s engine. It doesn’t just cover up your tiredness — it helps your cells get healthy and strong again, right where the problems start.

# My First 30 Days on MITOLYN: A Transformation

**Week 1:**  
The first change I noticed was my sleep. I started waking up feeling more rested and less achy. I didn’t have that heavy, groggy feeling that usually stuck with me all morning.

**Week 2:**  
I was surprised at how much more focused I felt. I could read or work for over an hour without getting distracted. I didn’t need coffee in the afternoon anymore, and I felt happier, too.

**Week 3:**  
I started moving more because I actually wanted to, not because I had to. My knees and shoulders didn’t hurt as much, so I went back to gardening and playing with my dog. People started telling me I looked healthier and more energetic.

**Week 4 and Beyond:**  
By the end of the first month, my life felt totally different. I was getting things done, laughing more, and looking forward to each day. My mind was clearer, and I felt like I could handle whatever came my way. I even started dreaming about new hobbies and adventures.

# Why MITOLYN Works When Others Don't

I’ve tried a lot of supplements in my life. Most of them just gave me a quick burst of energy, then left me feeling even more tired later. MITOLYN was different because it didn’t just cover up my symptoms — it went right to the source of my tiredness.

Here’s why MITOLYN stands out:

- **Targets the root cause:** It helps the mitochondria work better, so your body gets real, lasting energy.
- **Heals from the inside out:** By making new, healthy mitochondria and fixing the old ones, it helps every part of you — your mind, your muscles, even your heart.
- **Safe and clean:** MITOLYN uses ingredients that are tested and proven to work. There’s no weird stuff or fillers, just pure, helpful nutrients.

# What MITOLYN Gave Me That No Other Supplement Did

Here’s what changed for me after I started taking MITOLYN:

- I have steady, all-day energy (no more crashes).
- My memory is better and I don’t lose my train of thought as much.
- I’m less stressed out and in a better mood.
- I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed.
- My joints and muscles feel younger and stronger.
- I trust my body again and feel excited about the future.

MITOLYN didn’t just fix a few aches and pains. It gave me back the version of myself I thought was gone for good. I’m able to be there for my family, do my job, and enjoy life every single day.

# Is MITOLYN Worth It? 100% Yes — Here's Why You Should Act Now

You might wonder if MITOLYN is really worth trying. I used to ask myself, “Is it worth spending money on another supplement?” But then I thought about all the days I lost feeling tired and worn out. What’s the cost of missing out on the things and people you love?

For me, MITOLYN was the answer. It’s not just another quick fix — it’s a way to get your life and energy back. If you’re ready to feel good again, MITOLYN is the best step you can take.

# Final Thoughts: Don't Wait for a Wake-Up Call

I wish I had found MITOLYN sooner. I wasted years feeling sore, foggy, and slow, and I used to think that was normal. But now I know it doesn’t have to be that way. You don’t have to wait for things to get worse, or for a big health scare to make a change.

Trying MITOLYN was the best thing I did for myself. If you’re struggling with tiredness, aches, or brain fog, give it a try. One bottle, one month, one choice — it could open the door to a whole new you.

You deserve to feel healthy, happy, and full of life. Don’t wait. MITOLYN helped me, and it might just change everything for you, too.",1,1745573813.0,Speedrunning,0,1.0,False

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

Not too long ago, I felt like I was stuck in a never-ending loop of tiredness. Every morning, it was a struggle just to open my eyes. Imagine trying to run a marathon with a backpack full of rocks, except that marathon is just a normal day—making breakfast, going to work, trying to keep up with friends and family. I wasn’t technically sick, but I definitely wasn’t healthy.

I’d go to the doctor, hoping for an answer, but every test came back “fine.” My blood work was normal. My thyroid was normal. Even my vitamin levels were only a little off, nothing serious. But I knew deep down that something wasn’t right. My head felt foggy, my body ached, and I just wanted to hide from the world. Every little task—washing the dishes, answering emails, even getting dressed—felt like climbing a mountain.

I missed how I used to feel—full of energy, excited about life. I wanted that back. That’s when I heard about MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN isn’t your average energy pill or a quick fix that wears off in an hour. It’s a supplement that’s all about helping your mitochondria—the tiny engines inside your cells that make energy. When your mitochondria are strong, you feel alive and ready for anything. But as you get older, or if life gets stressful, your mitochondria can slow down. That means less energy, more tiredness, and even feeling older than you are.

MITOLYN was made to help fix that. It doesn’t just cover up tiredness—it goes deep, helping your cells make more energy naturally. When I learned about this, it finally made sense why I felt so drained. My problem wasn’t just “getting older” or “being stressed.” My cells needed help, and MITOLYN was created to do just that.

# Why I Took the Leap

I’ve tried so many things before—energy drinks, vitamins, even weird herbal teas. Most of them just made me feel jittery, or did nothing at all. I was tired of wasting money and getting my hopes up.

But MITOLYN seemed different. When I read the reviews, people described real changes—better focus, lasting energy, and even sleeping better. No one mentioned feeling shaky or having a crash later on. Plus, the ingredients had real science behind them. Things like CoQ10 and PQQ are used by doctors and studied by scientists. It wasn’t just marketing talk.

I hesitated, but finally took the risk and bought a bottle. I told myself, “If this doesn’t work, I’ll stop chasing after a magic cure.” But deep down, I hoped it would be the answer I needed.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first few days, I didn’t expect much. But around day three, it hit me—I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore. I got up without groaning or hitting snooze a hundred times. My mornings felt... lighter.

Usually, by the afternoon, I’d need a nap or another coffee just to keep my eyes open. But that week, I didn’t. I wasn’t bouncing off the walls, but I didn’t feel like a zombie either. It was like someone turned up the brightness on my day, just a little bit.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

By the second week, I noticed something I hadn’t felt in ages: my brain was clear. I could remember things better. I finished chores and work tasks without getting distracted or overwhelmed. I felt like I was finally in control of my day, not just fighting to get through it.

Evenings were different, too. I wasn’t collapsing on the couch, too tired to do anything fun. I actually wanted to work on my hobbies and chat with my family. I smiled more, and people around me noticed. It felt like the “real me” was coming back.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

Week three was when things got exciting. I started going for walks just because I wanted to move, not because I had to. Cooking dinner from scratch didn’t feel like a chore anymore—I enjoyed it! I even started exercising again, something I’d given up for months.

And this new energy wasn’t fake or forced. It came from inside, almost like my body remembered how to be young and alive again. I felt stronger, happier, and more like myself than I had in years.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

The best surprise for me was how I started sleeping. Before MITOLYN, I tossed and turned for hours every night. Now, I fall asleep quickly and wake up feeling refreshed, not groggy.

Other things got better, too. My skin looked brighter. My stomach felt calmer. I was even in a better mood and didn’t snap at little things like I used to. It really was like all the parts of my body were waking up and working together again. I finally felt healthy, not just “not sick.”

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

Here’s what makes MITOLYN special:

- **PQQ:** Helps your cells grow new, healthy mitochondria. That means more energy at the source.
- **CoQ10:** A natural part of your body’s energy-making process, but we have less of it as we get older.
- **NAD+ Precursors:** These help your body repair itself and slow down the aging process.
- **L-Carnitine & ALCAR:** Good for your brain and helps your body turn fat into energy.
- **B-Vitamins & Magnesium:** Support your nerves, help you handle stress, and keep your energy steady.

There are no fake colors, no harsh stimulants, and no junk. Just real ingredients your body knows how to use.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you wake up tired—even after a full night’s sleep—or if your mind feels cloudy and you forget things, MITOLYN could help. It’s also great if you feel older than you are, or if you miss having the energy you used to have. If you want to feel awake, focused, and happy again, I really think it’s worth a try.

# Final Verdict: Don't Wait Like I Did

Looking back, I wish I hadn’t waited so long to try MITOLYN. I spent months just getting by, thinking that being tired all the time was “normal.” But it doesn’t have to be. You don’t have to settle for half a life, always feeling drained or foggy.

MITOLYN helped me find the energy and joy I thought I’d lost forever. If you’re on the fence, let me be the push you need. Don’t wait for things to get worse. Give your body the help it needs now.

It started innocently enough. I was sitting on a park bench, sipping lukewarm coffee, when someone walked by, let one rip, and just kept moving like nothing happened. Something clicked.

Armed with Mason jars, a discreet labeling system, and what I now call the “Wind Tracker 3000” (a modified air quality sensor from eBay), I began casually following strangers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking Better Focus with Mushroom Supplements

If you find it hard to concentrate or often feel mentally foggy, mushroom supplements may be a natural way to sharpen your focus. Mushrooms like lion’s mane have compounds that support brain function by stimulating nerve growth and improving communication between brain cells. When you take these supplements regularly, you may notice your thoughts becoming more organized and your ability to pay attention increasing. This can be especially helpful during long work hours or when you need to study effectively.

### Supporting Memory and Recall

Mushroom supplements are known for their potential to enhance memory. Lion’s mane, in particular, contains bioactive substances that encourage the regeneration of brain cells and the creation of new neural pathways. This can lead to improved recall and faster learning. If you struggle with remembering names, dates, or important information, incorporating mushroom supplements into your routine might offer noticeable improvements. The natural support provided can help your brain work more efficiently without the jitters or crashes linked to some stimulants.

### Reducing Mental Fatigue for Sustained Energy

Mental fatigue can drag down your productivity and make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. Certain mushroom supplements, including cordyceps, are prized for their ability to boost energy levels on a cellular level. They help the body produce more ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency cells use to function. When your brain receives enough energy, it performs better, reducing feelings of tiredness and brain fog. This steady energy boost lets you maintain mental clarity throughout the day, without the need for excessive caffeine or sugar.

### Balancing Mood to Enhance Cognitive Function

Feeling stressed or anxious can cloud your thinking and slow down decision-making processes. Adaptogenic mushrooms such as reishi help regulate stress hormones and promote relaxation. By managing stress effectively, these mushroom supplements create a more balanced mental state. When your mood is stable, your brain can process information more clearly and make decisions faster. This natural mood support may help you stay calm during challenging situations, improving overall mental clarity.

### Boosting Antioxidant Protection for Brain Health

Everyday exposure to environmental toxins and stress can damage brain cells and reduce clarity over time. Many mushrooms, like chaga, are rich in antioxidants that protect brain cells from oxidative stress. This protection helps maintain healthy brain function and slows cognitive decline. Including antioxidant-packed mushroom supplements in your diet supports long-term mental clarity by preserving the health of your neurons. This naturally shields your mind from damage and keeps your thinking sharp as you age.

### Choosing the Right Mushroom Supplements

When selecting mushroom supplements to boost your mental clarity, quality is key. Look for products that use whole fruiting bodies instead of just mycelium, as they contain higher levels of beneficial compounds. Organic certification and third-party testing can reassure you about the purity and potency of the supplement. Additionally, consider blends that combine multiple brain-supporting mushrooms to maximize benefits, but always start with small doses to gauge how your body responds.

### Mushroom Supplements into Your Routine

Adding mushroom supplements can be easy and convenient. Many come in capsules, powders, or tinctures that can be mixed into smoothies, coffee, or tea. For best results, consistency is important—taking the supplements daily helps build their effects over time. Pairing mushroom supplements with healthy lifestyle habits like regular sleep, balanced nutrition, and physical activity will further enhance your mental clarity and overall cognitive health.

How to Choose the Best Mushroom Supplements for Cognitive Health
----------------------------------------------------------------

<div>When it comes to supporting your cognitive health, selecting the right mushroom supplements can make a notable difference. With so many options available on the market, understanding what to look for can help you choose a product that truly enhances your mental clarity and focus.

### Identify the Mushroom Types That Support Brain Function

Different mushroom species offer unique benefits for cognitive health. Some of the best-known mushrooms for boosting brain function include:

- **Lion’s Mane:** Renowned for its neuroprotective properties, Lion’s Mane helps stimulate nerve growth factor (NGF), which supports brain cell regeneration and improved memory.
- **Reishi:** While primarily known for stress reduction, Reishi mushrooms also help improve sleep quality, allowing your brain to recharge effectively.
- **Chaga:** Rich in antioxidants, Chaga mushrooms protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is linked to cognitive decline.
- **Cordyceps:** Boosts energy levels and oxygen flow, promoting better mental stamina and focus throughout the day.
 
By understanding the specific mushrooms inside a supplement, you can select one that aligns with your cognitive health goals.

### Check for Quality and Purity in Mushroom Supplements

Quality is crucial when choosing mushroom supplements. Inferior products may contain fillers, artificial additives, or diluted mushroom content, reducing their effectiveness. Here’s what to consider:

- **Organic Certification:** Opt for supplements labeled organic to ensure mushrooms are grown without harmful pesticides and chemicals.
- **Whole Mushroom vs. Mycelium:** Some supplements contain whole fruiting bodies, while others use mycelium grown on grain. Whole fruiting body extracts usually provide higher concentrations of active compounds beneficial for cognition.
- **Third-Party Testing:** Look for brands that offer third-party lab testing to verify the potency and purity of their supplements.
 
Reliable sourcing and transparent manufacturing practices are key indicators of a trustworthy mushroom supplement.

### Consider the Extraction Method for Maximum Benefits

The way mushroom supplements are extracted can greatly impact their potency and bioavailability. Hot water and alcohol extraction are the most effective methods for drawing out beneficial polysaccharides, beta-glucans, and triterpenoids.

Many labels mention “dual extraction,” which combines water and alcohol extraction to maximize the full spectrum of active ingredients. Choosing supplements that clearly explain their extraction process can help ensure you’re getting a formulation that supports cognitive enhancement effectively.

### Review Dosage Recommendations and Supplement Form

Getting the right dosage is essential in experiencing cognitive benefits. Mushroom supplements come in various forms such as capsules, powders, tinctures, and teas.

- **Capsules:** Convenient and standardized doses, easy for daily use.
- **Powders:** Versatile for mixing into drinks or food, though dosing requires attention to measure accurately.
- **Tinctures:** Liquid extracts allow for fast absorption and easy dose adjustment.
 
Check the label for the recommended daily serving and make sure it fits your lifestyle. Consistent use over weeks or months is often needed to notice cognitive improvements.

### Look for Additional Brain-Boosting Ingredients

Some mushroom supplements are combined with other natural ingredients that further support mental clarity. These may include:

- **Ginkgo Biloba:** Enhances blood circulation to the brain.
- **Bacopa Monnieri:** Known for improving memory and cognitive function.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** Helps reduce mental fatigue and improves concentration.
 
Combining mushroom supplements with scientifically supported brain enhancers can provide synergistic effects, making your cognitive health routine more effective.

### Pay Attention to Customer Reviews and Brand Reputation

Before finalizing your choice, take time to read user reviews and explore the brand’s reputation. Real customer feedback can provide insights into how effectively the supplement promotes mental clarity and whether it delivers on promised benefits.

Reputable brands often have transparent customer service and clear product information, which adds an extra layer of trust.

With these considerations in mind, choosing the best mushroom supplement to support cognitive health becomes a simpler, more informed process. By focusing on quality, ingredient potency, and your individual wellness needs, you can find a product that helps sharpen your mind and boost your mental clarity.

</div>### Conclusion

Mushroom supplements offer a natural and effective way to enhance your mental clarity, providing benefits that reach deep into your cognitive health. By exploring five key ways these supplements work—such as supporting brain cell regeneration, reducing inflammation, and improving focus—you can better understand how they might help you think more clearly and stay sharp throughout the day. Choosing the right mushroom supplements is just as important as knowing their benefits. Look for high-quality products made from well-researched mushroom varieties like Lion’s Mane, Reishi, and Cordyceps, and always check for purity and potency to ensure maximum effectiveness.

Taking the time to select the best supplements tailored to your cognitive health needs can make a significant difference in your mental performance. Whether you’re dealing with brain fog, struggling with concentration, or simply want to support long-term brain wellness, incorporating mushroom supplements into your daily routine can be a game-changer. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications. By combining informed choices with consistent use, you can unlock the powerful potential of mushroom supplements and enjoy sharper, clearer thinking every day. Your journey to improved mental clarity starts with smart, natural steps—and these supplements are a great place to begin.

Looking for a place that offers cheese boards, handpicked wines, and that chic ambience you’ve been craving? Say hello to Brooks Deli & Wine Bar, a hotspot tucked away in the charming village of Ockbrook.

Tucked just off the Toyota Island sits a place slinging the kind of coffee and comfort food that could make a traffic jam feel like a blessing.

Been Coffee is the real deal: award-winning, indie-run, eco-conscious, and slinging absolute flavour bombs like pizza bagels, monster cobs and thick-cut bacon bagels slathered in Philly. We're talking the kind of food that laughs in the face of sad desk lunches.

* Low-gluten? Vegan? Sorted.
* Cinnamon buns, flapjacks, sausage rolls so good they should be illegal, and a hot drinks list that'll have your inner barista weeping with joy.
* And the coffee? Rich, roasted and reliable – like your nan, if she made killer lattes.

Pop in for the bagel. Stay for the brownies. Leave smug with your compostable cup.

If your week’s been flatter than a pint left out overnight, this one’s the tonic.

The Funhouse Comedy Club is back, and it’s stacked with certified legends. Headlining is Mandy Muden – Britain’s Got Talent semi-finalist and the only woman fusing comedy with madcap magic. Think Vegas meets your nan’s living room. Expect chaos, charm, and a few card tricks gone rogue.

Opening the night is Rob Rouse – the shouty bloke off *Upstart Crow*, *8 Out of 10 Cats*, and probably your telly. His stand-up’s like being hit by a glitter cannon of hilarious life trauma.

Bar’s open. Car park’s sorted. Laughter guaranteed. Go.

Dress to impress — there’s a prize for the best outfit — and don’t forget: *we’re all mad here*.

Family-friendly in the afternoon, cheekier in the evening. Book early or risk being late, late, *for a very important date*.

This is your shot at hearing from the other side (without a dodgy Ouija board involved). Expect audience interaction, jaw-dropping insights, and a few raised eyebrows.

Arrive early, grab a drink, and settle in for an experience that’s as moving as it is mind-bending. No tarot cards or fog machines — just pure, spine-tingling connection.

Artcore’s bringing the heat with *Common Grounds* — a brand new exhibition showing off work from eight seriously talented artists, including Derby’s own Vivian Viv Taylor.

It’s a mixed bag of styles, themes and stories — from bold brushstrokes to abstract angles that’ll leave you thinking (or just saying “ooh, nice”).

This launch night’s not just for the arty crowd either — it’s for anyone who likes a good browse, a decent vibe, and meeting local creatives doing exciting stuff.

Grab a mate, swing by after work, and soak up some culture!

1k7gqzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindchronicels/comments/1k7gqzg/elenas_light/,🌸 Elena’s Light 🌸,"

Elena was a quiet soul in a loud, indifferent world.

She had soft brown hair that flowed like autumn winds and eyes the color of warm earth after rain—gentle, deep, and full of stories. Life hadn’t been kind; she lost her parents young and grew up learning to stand on her own feet. Yet, despite her solitude, Elena never grew bitter. She smiled—always. A smile full of hope, of grace, of someone who had chosen light even when surrounded by darkness.

And then she found love.

He was her first everything—first crush, first kiss, first person to make her believe she was meant to be loved. For seven years, they shared secrets, dreams, and lazy sunsets. He held her hand like it was the most delicate thing in the world. Elena was happy. Radiantly, completely happy. She thought their love was forever.

Until one ordinary evening, that changed.

They met for a date like usual. She wore her favorite dress and her heart on her sleeve. But his eyes were distant.

“I’m getting married,” he said.

She laughed softly, confused. “To me?”

“No,” he whispered. “To someone else. She’s… wealthy. It’s better this way.”

Just like that, her world collapsed.

Seven years reduced to silence. To a reason that felt like betrayal. He had chosen comfort over love.

Tears burned her eyes, but she didn’t let them fall in front of him. “I see,” she said softly. “Thank you for the honesty.”

And she walked away—heart cracked, but dignity untouched.

Then came the unthinkable—an invitation to his wedding.

Most would have torn it apart. But Elena wasn’t most.

With quiet courage, she went. Not to prove a point, not to win him back—but to tell her heart it was over. To look her pain in the eye and say: *you do not define me.*

At the wedding, she kept her head high. But inside, her heart trembled. And there, fate intervened.

She met someone.

A man from her past—her senior from school. His name was Ayaan. Warm smile, kind eyes, and a calm presence that reminded her of safe places. They spoke like old friends, laughter slowly weaving through her pain. It was unexpected. Easy.

Still, Elena told herself: *No more love. Not again.*

But Ayaan kept appearing—in gentle texts, in coffee shop run-ins, in shared silences that felt comforting, not heavy. He never pushed. He simply… stayed.

And slowly, the walls she built began to soften.

One day, under a tree blooming with spring, Ayaan took her hand and said, “I don’t know everything you've been through, Elena. But I do know this—I want to be someone who never lets you feel unloved again. Will you give us a chance?”

Elena froze. Her past surged like a wave. The heartbreak. The fear. The scars that hadn’t fully healed.

“I… I need time,” she said honestly, her voice trembling. “I want to trust again. But I need to be sure. I don’t want to love someone in pieces.”

Ayaan smiled. “Then I’ll wait. For all of you.”

That night, Elena sat by her window, watching the stars, remembering her past—but for the first time, not with pain, but with peace.

Because love hadn’t betrayed her.

The wrong person had.

And this time, maybe… just maybe… love was writing her a new story.

1k7gq0t,https://v.redd.it/kc8rj3659ywe1,Dialing in espresso [Sage Barista Express],"Hi all. Could you have a look at my video and let me know what I'm doing wrong? I'm getting some coffee splashing the glass during the shot. 

Also, I'm preparing my puck in exactly the same way, using 18.5G in, 37g out, but sometimes the taste is sweet and perfect, other times bitter. Is this just due to the limitations of the built in grinder? I'm on top of cleaning the machine, basket, puck shield etc. 

Good to know that the beans are a light roast, so I'm grinding finer and allowing a longer extraction time - is this correct? Thanks!

1k7gpcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Heidelberg/comments/1k7gpcq/getting_around_heidelberg_with_luggage/,Getting around Heidelberg with luggage,"G'day,

I'm flying in from Australia and starting a long-term residency in Heidelberg this coming Monday, the 28th -- exciting etc. I have a simple question: I'll arrive by train at Heidelberg Hbf early on Sunday and then have a hotel right by Heidelberger Marktplatz.

This is walkable for sure, and I love getting out on my feet early, but with a bunch of luggage it seems like it could be annoying. What's the recommendation? Google gives me train options, but I hate being a menace with luggage and getting in people's way, especially on a Sunday morning. You can also tell me just get on the damn train, fool. I will appreciate that, too.

I'll be seeking out the Heidelberg Knights when I arrive, as well as scoping out the best coffee. Any recommendations also welcome.

She is asymptomatic in small amounts but if eaten repeatedly she starts to get sick.

Overall notes:
- [ ] People like to pretend to know exactly what you are talking about even if they have no clue. Bring an allergy card and force them to read it. They want your money so they will.
- [ ] Most places there is some risk. After about 2 weeks she was not feeling great, likely from cross contamination. 
- [ ] We packed 3 freeze dried meals, peanut butter, Nutella, and nuts. This helped a ton in a pinch. Highly recommend.
- [ ] When in doubt steamed rice and hard boiled eggs are safe and you can get them pretty easily.
- [ ] Buffet breakfasts at hostels/hotels normally offer fruit and eggs of some kind which is reasonably safe. Many are hard boiled which makes it 100% safe. Pair it with some sugary coffee and it’s a decent meal. 

Cities/destinations
For the purpose of ratings I’m only talking about my (perceived) safety of the places. 

Ho Chi Minh - 5/5 safe with options
- [ ] In’joy Cafe & Bake 5/5 - dedicated gluten free cafe. Very good food. Doesn’t open till late for food but 100% safe. Their chicken floss mochi might be my favorite dish in Vietnam.
- [ ] Gluten free gourmet 5/5 - dedicated gluten free. Best gf baguettes and bagels we have ever had. They also deliver although that has its pros and cons. Bigger menu if you go there.
- [ ] Den Long Restaurant 4/5 - GF Marked likely is mostly safe. Probably some risk with cross contamination but we are here without (immediate) issue. The food is decent but nothing to blow your mind.

Hoi An - 5/5 safe with options
- [ ] Dingo Deli 5/5 - separate kitchen with lots of American food. They have measures in place to help communicate and confirm things are gluten free, such as little flags. Wait staff speak good English and can walk you through the safety.
- [ ] Bun Cha Ta 5/5 - dedicated gf, kitchen only makes bun cha which is naturally gluten free. The wait staff I feel like get a kick out of foreigners eating here. Bun cha as they made it was not our favorite… Some people said it was inedible. I think that’s hard but yea not my favorite. The sticky rice and yogurt desert gets a shout out for being the worst dish I tried in Vietnam. 
- [ ] ??? 5/5 - owner takes your order and cooks it himself. He is very diligent and has separate soy sauce. He is able to tell you ingredients in each dish. A waitress brought over soy sauce and he ran over to take it away and brought us a gluten free one instead. I believe this place is safe and while not Vietnamese the orange chicken might be the best I’ve ever had. Likely the only risk is cross contamination but he’s doing stuff to avoid it as best as able.

Hue - 2/5 likely not safe. There may be a place that is safe.
- [ ] Golden Rice 2/5 - gluten free options available if asked. Waiters give conflicting information. The first made us feel okay, the second obviously had no clue what he was talking about. He hit us with a “I’ve served many people with celiac and none have died” and told us we could have anything on the menu. My hunch is this restaurant is not safe and they are just saying whatever they feel they need to get you to eat there. If you do decide to eat here look for foods that shouldn’t have gluten.
- [ ] Risotto Restaurant 1/5 - Only restaurant we had to walk out of in Vietnam. She had already been feeling unwell and this one there was just no way. They advertise gluten free but they seemed confused when we asked. Asked which options were gluten free and they pointed some out. Got the allergy card out and confirmed the dish had no gluten containing ingredients in it. She said it had some. So we asked which we could have and she didn’t know.
- [ ] Challenge Thai - 3/5 - probably the safest option in Hue. The chef takes your order and takes the time to read the card. There are dishes without soy sauce and he cleans the wok between each meal. The meals are basically free and pretty good. I tipped him well since he made the effort to try and make it gluten free and I think did okay.

Da Nang - 4/5 safe options
- [ ] craft cafe 4/5 - we at here 3 times. The waffles are safe. The food is decent though not very filling. We just weren’t up for risk with her not feeling well. 
- [ ] Limoncello 4/5 - we are here once. Food is expensive and comes in small portions but should be safe. They knew not to bring out bread since we both ordered gluten free. They have gluten free noodles and that’s all you can have. They definitely are gluten free hahahaha. Food was good, expensive, and small portioned but safe is safe.

Cat Ba Island - 1/5 no safe options
- [ ] This is a steamed rice and boiled egg kind of place. She ate freeze dried meals + pb Nutella’s for every meal. Got some steamed rice from long coffee which was as advertised.

Hanoi - 4/5 safe options
- [ ] GF gourmet Hanoi 5/5 - Owned by the same people as the one in HCMC. Hours are short which is tough. Seems like a one person operation.
- [ ] Bun Cha Ta 5/5 - owned by the same people as the one in Hoi An. Maybe marginally better tasting
- [ ] Green Farm Cooking 4/5 - They offer gluten free cooking classes. It was mid at best but seemed safe. The market tour was probably the worst tour I paid for in Vietnam. I thought we were gonna buy stuff but I just wandered around with a local who didn’t speak English. He likes to poke the turtles. Totally weird experience. They bring out unsafe ingredients but they removed them after reading our card.

I hope somewhere along the way this will help somebody. We had an awesome time in Vietnam and it’s worth it even if food is tricky. I couldn’t find anything as comprehensive as we wanted for a guide so this is my attempt to make one.

## Key Features Analysis

The market offers a diverse array of gold candles,each boasting unique features that differentiate them from one another. Examining these features closely is essential for consumers aiming to make informed purchase decisions.

**Material Composition:** Gold candles often utilize a blend of high-quality waxes, such as soy wax, beeswax, or paraffin wax, combined with specifically chosen fragrance oils.

the use of soy wax, for example, is increasingly common due to its clean-burning properties and lower environmental impact compared to paraffin wax. Beeswax candles are prized for their natural honey scent and long burn times.The quality of the fragrance oils is equally vital, determining the scent throw and longevity of the fragrance, often incorporating natural essential oils for a more authentic aroma and to avoid synthetic chemical smells that are harsh.

**Burn Time:** A crucial factor for consumers is the burn time, which varies based on the candle's size, wax type, and wick design.

Large jar candles can offer burn times exceeding 50 hours,while smaller votives may last only a few hours. proper wick trimming is essential to maximize burn time and minimize soot production,typically recommended every 3-4 hours of burn time.The design of the wick itself also contributes to the candle's burn efficiency,with options like wooden wicks offering a crackling sound and a slower burn rate.

**Scent Profiles:** Gold candles are available in a wide range of scent profiles, from floral and fruity to woody and spicy, catering to various personal preferences and seasonal themes.Popular fragrances include vanilla, lavender, sandalwood, and citrus blends, and candle manufacturers frequently release limited edition scents linked to specific holidays or seasons. The intensity of the scent throw, defined as how far the fragrance permeates a space, is a key consideration for consumers, with some preferring subtle aromas while others seek a more powerful fragrance experience. Scent descriptions are often detailed, noting the top, middle, and base notes to provide a comprehensive understanding of the scent profile before purchase.

**Container Aesthetics:** The aesthetic appeal of the candle container is a significant buying factor, particularly with gold candles, were the visual presentation is crucial.Containers range from simple glass jars with gold accents to ornate metallic vessels, frequently enough designed to be repurposed after the candle is finished. The finish of the gold, whether matte, glossy, or textured, plays a critical role in its overall visual impact, and many candles are designed to complement various interior design styles, from modern to vintage. The container material also affects safety, with durable materials like glass and metal being preferred for their heat resistance.

**Wick Design:** The type and number of wicks utilized affect the burn quality, scent throw, and overall aesthetic of the candle.

Single-wick candles are common for smaller sizes, while larger candles may utilize multiple wicks to ensure an even and consistent burn. The material of the wick, typically cotton or wood, influences the burn rate and the amount of soot produced. wooden wicks are increasingly popular as they offer a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, adding an additional sensory dimension to the candle-burning experience. Proper wick maintenance,which involves trimming the wick to about ¼ inch before each use,is essential for optimal performance and prevents smoking.

Key features of gold candles include:

* High-quality wax blends for clean burning.
* Extended burn times depending on size and composition
* Diverse range of scent profiles to suit diffrent preferences.
* Aesthetically pleasing containers designed for visual appeal.
* Wick designs intended for even burning and optimal scent throw.

These candles lend themselves perfectly to creating mood lighting, setting the tone for intimate dinners, relaxing bath sessions, or cozy evenings spent reading.**Enhanced Sensory Experience:** Beyond visual appeal, gold candles appeal to other senses through carefully curated fragrances. The combination of the flickering flame, warm light, and captivating scent creates a multi-sensory experience.

such as, lighting a gold candle with a calming lavender scent can transform a bedroom into a peaceful sanctuary, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. The interplay between the visual and olfactory elements enhances the overall impact, making the candle-burning experience richer and more immersive. Whether it's the soothing aroma of chamomile or the invigorating fragrance of citrus,the olfactory dimension elevates the candle-burning experience.

**Versatile Decor Accent:** Gold candles are incredibly versatile decor accents, seamlessly blending with various interior design styles. Their elegant aesthetic complements both modern and conventional settings.

Imagine a modern minimalist apartment; a gold candle can add a subtle pop of warmth and texture without disrupting the clean lines of the design.

They can be placed on coffee tables, shelves, mantels, or used as part of a tablescape to add visual interest and create a focal point.

## FAQs Section

Consumers frequently enough have specific questions when considering the purchase of gold candles. Addressing these frequently asked questions can clarify uncertainties and help guide their decision.

**What is the best way to prevent tunneling in gold candles?**
Tunneling, where the candle burns down the center leaving wax around the edges, can be prevented by ensuring the candle burns long enough for the entire top layer of wax to melt completely on the first burn. This usually takes about 2-3 hours. Subsequent burns should also allow for a full melt pool to ensure even burning and prevent further tunneling. Using a candle warmer is another excellent method to ensure all the wax melts evenly.

**How do I clean a gold candle container after the candle has burned out?**
Cleaning the container typically involves removing any remaining wax residue. One method to soften the wax is placing the container in the freezer for a few hours, causing the wax to shrink and easily pop out. Alternatively, you can pour hot (not boiling) water into the container to melt the remaining wax, which can then be poured out. Be sure to avoid pouring the wax down any drains as it might cause a blockage. Afterwards, wash the container with soap and water.

**Are gold candles safe for people with sensitivities or allergies?**
The safety of gold candles for individuals with sensitivities or allergies largely depends on the ingredients used in the wax and fragrance oils. Opt for candles made with natural waxes like soy or beeswax and infused with essential oils rather than synthetic fragrance oils. Look for candles labeled as hypoallergenic or designed for sensitive skin.Whenever trying a new candle, burn it for a short period initially to see if there is any allergic reaction.

**How do I maximize the scent throw of my gold candle?**
to maximize the scent throw, burn the candle in a well-ventilated room, as proper air circulation helps to distribute the fragrance. Ensure that the wick is trimmed to about ¼ inch before each use to prevent smoking and promote an even burn. Avoid burning the candle in drafty areas, which can cause the flame to flicker and diminish the scent throw. Placing the candle at nose level can also augment the scent experience.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The 2024 coffee advent calendars are packed with features designed to enhance the coffee-drinking experience.

**Variety of Coffee Origins and Flavors**

Most coffee advent calendars showcase a wide range of coffee origins, from the rich volcanic soils of Central America to the high-altitude estates of Africa and the unique profiles of Asian beans. This diversity allows consumers to explore a spectrum of flavor notes, including fruity, chocolatey, nutty, and floral characteristics. The inclusion of flavored coffees, such as gingerbread, peppermint, or vanilla, further enriches the experience, adding a festive twist to the daily brew.

**Individually Wrapped or Sealed Portions**

To maintain freshness and aroma, each coffee portion is typically individually wrapped or sealed. This ensures that the coffee remains at its peak quality throughout the advent period. The packaging often includes information about the coffee's origin, roast level, and recommended brewing method, enhancing the educational aspect of the experience.

**Range of Roast Levels**

Coffee advent calendars usually feature a selection of roast levels, from light to dark, catering to different preferences. Light roasts tend to highlight the coffee's origin characteristics, while medium roasts offer a balanced flavor profile, and dark roasts provide a bolder, more intense taste. This variety allows consumers to experiment with different roast levels and discover their personal favorites.

**Sustainable and Ethical Sourcing**

Many coffee advent calendars prioritize sustainability and ethical sourcing, featuring coffees that are Fair Trade certified, organic, or sourced from farms with sustainable practices. This appeals to environmentally conscious consumers who want to enjoy their daily coffee knowing that it has been produced responsibly. The inclusion of information about the coffee's sourcing helps to promote awareness and support ethical coffee production.

**Brewing Method Compatibility**

Most coffee advent calendars contain ground coffee suitable for various brewing methods, including drip coffee makers, French presses, pour-over devices, and Aeropresses. Some calendars may also include whole bean coffee, allowing consumers to grind the beans fresh for optimal flavor. This versatility ensures that the coffee can be enjoyed regardless of the user's preferred brewing method.

**Festive and Attractive Packaging**

The coffee advent calendars typically come in beautifully designed and festive packaging, making them an attractive gift or a decorative addition to the home during the holiday season. The packaging often features numbered compartments or doors that reveal a new coffee each day, adding to the excitement and anticipation of the advent period.

 ## Core Benefits

Coffee advent calendars offer several compelling benefits to coffee lovers.

**Discovery of New Coffee Varieties:** The primary benefit is the opportunity to sample a diverse range of coffees from different origins and with various flavor profiles. This allows users to expand their coffee horizons and discover new favorites they might not have otherwise tried. For instance, someone who typically drinks a medium roast Brazilian coffee might discover a newfound appreciation for a light roast Ethiopian Yirgacheffe with its fruity and floral notes.

**Elevated Daily Coffee Ritual:** Instead of the routine cup of joe, each day becomes a special occasion. The anticipation of opening the daily coffee provides a moment of excitement and discovery, transforming the daily coffee ritual into a more enjoyable and engaging experience. This added element of surprise can brighten up even the busiest of mornings.

**Perfect Gift for Coffee Enthusiasts:** A coffee advent calendar makes an ideal gift for the coffee lover in your life. It's a thoughtful and unique present that provides a month-long experience of coffee exploration and enjoyment. The recipient can look forward to trying a new coffee each day, making it a gift that keeps on giving throughout the holiday season.

**Convenient Way to Try Premium Coffees:** Many coffee advent calendars feature premium, specialty coffees that might be too expensive to purchase in larger quantities. The smaller portions allow consumers to sample these high-quality coffees without committing to a full bag, making it a cost-effective way to experience the best that the coffee world has to offer.

**Festive Countdown Experience:** The coffee advent calendar adds a unique and flavorful dimension to the traditional countdown to Christmas. It's a fun and engaging way to mark the days leading up to the holiday, offering a daily dose of caffeine and cheer.

Here’s the actual ground reality from what we’re seeing inside decks, deals, and dashboards: D2C isn’t dead but the shortcut playbook is. The Meta-money-fueled, discount-led, aesthetic-over-substance approach? That’s what’s dying.

What’s actually working right now in D2C:

⸻

1. Tight positioning isn’t niche! it’s your early-stage advantage. Most D2C brands fail not because the product is bad, but because the positioning is generic.

Strong positioning answers three things instantly: Who is this for? What problem does it solve? Why now?

Look at how Indian brands nailed this: • Pilgrim created ingredient-led skincare rituals, not just creams. • mCaffeine became synonymous with coffee-based skincare, and owned that lane. • Snitch didn’t chase the menswear market; it dominated fast-fashion drops for bold, urban youth. • Nua focused deeply on period care before expanding into broader wellness. • The Whole Truth didn’t compete on protein bars, it competed on radical transparency.

They didn’t try to be for “everyone.” They were undeniable to someone and that’s what scaled.

⸻

2. High-AOV products > low-ticket volume. If your cart value is under ₹500 and you’re paying ₹150–₹250 CAC, it’s game over. The best brands optimize for bundles, trials, and subscriptions from day one, not post Series A.

⸻

3. WhatsApp isn’t for updates, it’s a revenue channel. We’ve seen 20–30% lifts from flows that: • Recover abandoned carts • Upsell post-purchase combos • Share UGC/content that builds trust WhatsApp works but only if you treat it like a funnel, not just a courier.

⸻

4. Nano > macro, but only with tight execution. Don’t give creators a product and hope. Give them angles, CTAs, and purpose. Small creators convert better but only if they’re part of the narrative, not a checklist.

⸻

5. Retention is your only real moat. If your product doesn’t bring people back in 30 days without a discount… stop scaling. Retention > CAC. Always.

Just a vent because I unkowingly neglected myself and I feel ill equipped as an adult, despite my learning and growth. Is this the true self care, knowing when to rest and be patient with yourself?

I don't mind getting sick, thats life. What saddens me, is that the lack of care meant I kept going until I was too sick to function. And that's carried into my adult life, because I don't know what's sick enough to stop working. So I still keep going till I drop and then keep relapsing because I don't rest for long enough.

An unfortunate addition is having other illnesses that cause fatigue. So when I get new illnesses e.g. the flu, I overlook the fatigue and overcompensate with coffee and sugar because I feel my body is working against me rather than realising its forcing me to rest because I am unwell. It's very much like the regular posts say, when you have no one to rely on, you force yourself to keep going because you have to. But it's to your detriment. 

I have the flu for the third time this year, and feel I can't take more time off work. But at this rate something has to give, which means working less hours now so my body can heal and I can be stronger in the future. But even thinking this way makes me feel so guilty because everyone in my past made me feel I needed to prioritise them and neglect myself to be loved and to feel worthy. 

Even when you feel you've healed a lot, this stuff really pulls you down, coming up when you're already dealing with a challenge. The life of a neglected kid...

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said.

I am by far the morning person still and my fiancé is not. It always takes him what feels like FOREVER to get out of bed and then he moves like a sloth!

Now that we have a baby and I am the primary caretaker, I need and want my sleep and I do not want his alarms waking up the baby who currently still sleeps in our room still. This morning, he started work at 3:30am, and didn't get up to any of his alarms. When I woke up to one of his alarms at 3:03am, I nudged him to get up and get going because he could get to work on time still. I said I'll go pack your lunch box and coffee, you get up and get ready knowing the help can get him out the door faster. When I came back into the room at 3:08am, he was still in bed on his phone doing something with his alarms and I stood in the doorway silently waiting to see him get up. He didn't get out of bed until 3:11am. A long time, no but I got irritated because I am up trying to help him and I felt like he was not helping himself. Like, I'm in the kitchen getting him ready to be able to leave quickly while he is pussyfooting around, so I stopped making his lunch before I even started. I left his lunch box open with the ice packs next to his coffee I already made on the counter and went back to bed. He was almost done getting dressed and gave me, the dogs and baby kisses goodbye but when he got into the kitchen at 3:18am, he saw that I had stopped making his lunch and immediately started talking shit and calling me petty. I don't let him speak to me like that so I got out of bed and said things back to him calmly like ""you didn't seem to be in a rush, so why would I"", ""yes, I stopped making your lunch when I realized you don't care that I'm awake helping you but you're dragging ass"" ""you don't care about getting to work quickly"".  I felt bad for being like that early in the morning, so I finished packing his lunch box with his water and snacks and went back to bed. When he opened the lunchbox, he said ""Aw no sandwiches.."", which didn't bother me, but I knew he still needed to get sock, boots and coat on. So I again, got out of bed, went and made him two pb&j's, finishing them before he even got his boots on. I put them into the lunchbox and he said ""I see your point and what you did there. Proving you can make sandwiches faster than I can finish getting ready"". I knew I could finish the sandwiches before he could get out the door, because I am a fast paced mover in the am.

I’ve been on a bit of a biohacking journey lately—cleaning up my supplements, rethinking energy levels, and just trying to feel *better* without loading up on caffeine or sketchy “quick fixes.” That’s when I stumbled across **Mitolyn**, and after doing some digging (and testing), I thought I’d write up this **Mitolyn review** for anyone curious.

👉 **Affiliate Link if you wanna check it out**: [Mitolyn Official Website](https://purplepeel.com/welcome/?aff=christosis)

# ⚙️ What Is Mitolyn?

**Mitolyn** is a **mitochondrial support supplement** designed to help your cells produce energy more efficiently. If you’ve ever felt sluggish, brain-fogged, or just constantly tired despite decent sleep—your mitochondria might be waving a white flag.

This supplement combines science-backed ingredients like **CoQ10**, **PQQ**, **L-Carnitine**, and **NAD+ boosters** to target the *source* of your energy: your cells.

# 🔬 My Experience with Mitolyn

I started taking **Mitolyn** about 3 weeks ago. I wasn’t expecting miracles, just a little extra clarity and energy throughout the day. Here's what I noticed:

* ☀️ **More morning energy** (without needing 3 cups of coffee)
* 🧠 **Sharper focus** during deep work sessions
* 😴 **Better sleep quality** – maybe from less daytime stress?
* 💪 No jitters, crashes, or weird side effects

I’ve tried a lot of nootropics and wellness supplements, but **Mitolyn** feels like it's working with my body instead of against it.

# 🌱 Key Ingredients in Mitolyn (Why It Works)

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial ATP production
* **PQQ** – Supports the growth of new mitochondria (neat, right?)
* **L-Carnitine** – Helps transport fatty acids for energy
* **Riboflavin (B2)** – Vital for energy metabolism
* **Magnesium Glycinate** – Supports muscle function and calmness

These are well-researched, synergistic ingredients that do more than just “boost energy” — they help at a **cellular level**.

# ✅ Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* Clean, research-based formula
* Great for mental and physical energy
* No artificial additives or junk
* Transparent company with solid customer support

**Cons:**

* Premium pricing (but worth it IMO)
* Only available online

# 💡 Who Is Mitolyn For?

* Anyone struggling with **chronic fatigue**
* People interested in **anti-aging** and **cellular health**
* Entrepreneurs, students, or creatives who need **clean focus**
* Fitness folks wanting better **recovery and performance**

If your energy feels “off” or inconsistent, **Mitolyn** might be what your cells have been missing.

# 🔗 Where to Buy Mitolyn

👉 You can grab it directly from the official source here:  
[Mitolyn Official Website](https://purplepeel.com/welcome/?aff=christosis)

No shady third-party sites. They also offer a **money-back guarantee**, so no real risk if you wanna give it a shot.

# 🙋‍♂️ FAQs About Mitolyn

**1. How long does it take to feel the effects of Mitolyn?**  
Most users (myself included) feel subtle improvements within the first 7–10 days. Full results tend to show up after 2–4 weeks of consistent use.

**2. Is Mitolyn safe for daily use?**  
Yes, all ingredients are clinically studied and considered safe for daily consumption when used as directed.

**3. Can I take Mitolyn with coffee or other supplements?**  
Totally. I actually stack it with a basic multivitamin and still drink my morning coffee — no problems at all.

**4. Does Mitolyn help with mental clarity and focus?**  
Absolutely. The mitochondrial support translates to better brain energy, which can feel like sharper focus and reduced brain fog.

**5. Is Mitolyn vegan and gluten-free?**  
Yes, it's vegan, gluten-free, and non-GMO — clean and inclusive.

# 🔍 Final Verdict: Is Mitolyn Worth It?

If you're tired of being tired and want a smarter, deeper approach to energy, **Mitolyn is absolutely worth trying**. It’s not a stimulant — it’s real support for your cells, your energy, and your longevity.

I have La Marzocco Linea Micra. The coffee I often buy is washed, light/medium roast - I really like fruity/light flavours. The darker roasts are actually ok with it, and much easier.

1k7gey8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DrGopalRao/comments/1k7gey8/top_5_jobs_that_can_lead_to_piles/,Top 5 Jobs That Can Lead to Piles,"Let’s be honest—piles (also known as hemorrhoids) are something most people don’t want to talk about. 

But if you’re feeling discomfort, itching, or pain after long workdays, your job could be quietly contributing to the problem.

At Gopal Rao’s Piles and Ano-Rectal Centre, a leading [**piles clinic in Mumbai**](https://gopalraopilesclinic.com/), we regularly treat professionals whose work life plays a major role in their condition. 

The good news? 

With the right awareness and care, you can prevent piles—or treat them effectively if they’ve already started causing trouble.

# 1. Desk Workers & IT Professionals

https://preview.redd.it/9vuvbeb95ywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9cfd43673695f060683c3fd2c8ae13d15adf48a

Spending 8 to 10 hours a day glued to a chair wreaks havoc on your lower body. 

Lack of movement restricts blood flow in the rectal area, which can cause swelling of the veins around the anus and rectum—aka, piles.

If you're working in an office or from home and rarely getting up from your chair, you're at higher risk. 

We often see IT professionals and software engineers come in for piles treatment in Mumbai with symptoms like bleeding during bowel movements or a constant feeling of heaviness in the anal area.

Prevention Tips:

* Set a timer to stand up and stretch every hour.
* Use a standing desk if possible.
* Stay hydrated—water helps keep stools soft.

# 2. Drivers (Cab, Auto, Truck & Delivery)

https://preview.redd.it/wwdayepb5ywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70204a8eaf933279659da0132758e1a065e5b866

Drivers are some of the most frequent visitors at our piles clinic in Mumbai. 

Long hours of sitting behind the wheel, combined with irregular meals and dehydration, can strain the lower rectum. Add to that poor access to clean toilets on the go, and you’ve got a recipe for chronic piles or fissures.

Prevention Tip:

* Take walking breaks between trips.
* Carry fiber-rich snacks and water.
* Avoid delaying bathroom breaks for too long.

# 3. BPO & Call Center Employees

https://preview.redd.it/x34yztxf5ywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f81a0fb77c9ddc75eaacac9e2910afaefda10d30

Night shifts, sedentary work, stress, and excessive caffeine—sound familiar? 

People working in call centers or BPOs often suffer from digestive issues and constipation, which can lead to piles. 

Unfortunately, many don’t seek help until the condition becomes painful or starts bleeding.

If this sounds like you, it’s time to consult with experienced pile doctors in your area who can guide you on both lifestyle and medical treatments.

Prevention Tip:

* Reduce processed food and coffee intake.
* Incorporate fiber in late-night meals.
* Prioritize regular bowel movements.

# 4. Manual Laborers & Weightlifters

https://preview.redd.it/d590qa0i5ywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be9fe57cd7a26dc5e015fbe99d25734c88e45afc

Lifting heavy objects increases abdominal pressure. 

If you regularly strain while lifting—whether it’s weights in the gym or bags at a warehouse—you’re putting your rectal veins under intense stress. Over time, this can result in internal or external piles.

We’ve treated many patients who assumed they had a “muscle pull” but were actually dealing with advanced-stage piles or even a fistula.

Prevention Tip:

* Use proper lifting technique.
* Never ignore symptoms like anal pain or bleeding.
* Don’t “push through the pain” — get checked early.

# 5. Teachers, Surgeons & Professionals Who Stand Too Long

https://preview.redd.it/05zddtro5ywe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ebdefb2142c4d7195dc5d2460acc69e1abb2454

Surprisingly, it’s not just sitting that causes piles. Standing for long periods without movement can also increase pressure on the lower rectum. 

Professions like teaching, retail, and surgery often require long hours on your feet—without adequate breaks or hydration.

We see many professionals come to our piles clinic with symptoms they brushed off as “just tiredness” until it became something more serious.

Prevention Tip:

* Take sitting breaks throughout the day.
* Keep stool soft with a fiber-rich diet and plenty of water.
* Don’t suppress the urge to go to the bathroom.

# What to Do If You’re Experiencing Symptoms

If you’re dealing with:

* Bleeding while passing stool
* Pain, itching, or a lump near the anus
* Constant discomfort while sitting

…it’s time to talk to a piles specialist. **Piles don’t usually go away on their own**—and they can worsen over time if left untreated.

In the early stages, lifestyle changes—like improving your diet, staying hydrated, and moving more—can help a lot. 

But if the discomfort keeps returning, it might be worth consulting a [**piles doctor**](https://gopalraopilesclinic.com/talk-with-piles-doctor-in-mumbai/) who specializes in advanced piles treatment options.

Today, there are gentle and minimally invasive options available, including laser treatments that don’t require much recovery time. Piles Clinics in Mumbai, such as [**Gopal Rao’s Piles and Ano-Rectal Centre**](https://g.co/kgs/MRfKkq5), offer these kinds of inimally invasive [**laser piles treatments in Mumbai**](https://gopalraopilesclinic.com/best-piles-clinic-mumbai/) and can walk you through what’s best based on your specific case.

Even if it’s just for peace of mind, a quick consultation can help you understand your options and feel more in control of your health.

Well one morning I was feeling it, when the cashier said ""can't complain"" to how are you, I said I can, let's be honest, and it turned into a conversation about how she twisted her ankle and her car almost got towed -- she was having a bad day. There was no line, I comisserated about bullshit parking tickets and how dumb it is we don't let people sit down in America. I'm somewhere near the median in social graces so I was semi awkward and a little loud. But I got my coffee, and went on my way.

I gave up on everything and now I follow a very clean diet. With no alcohol, lean proteins (fish, chicken and turkey mostly), a bit of carbs (mostly gluten free or low gluten) zucchini, carrots, eggplants, so e sometimes avocados, fennels. And nothing else. Everything fresh, no preservatives, etc...

So the only thing I can't give up it's coffee. In the morning I'm having 1 latte and 2 Americano, until I get the stimulus, otherwise I can't go. In the bad days I have to add 1/2 more espressos (but most of time I'm okay with the baseline routine).

Anyway I know coffee is irritating badly my stomach lining, but not having a bowel movement is worse so I keep drinking it.

I'm taking magnesium and glutammine to counter this, but it's still not good. I ordered green clay and I'll start taking it in about a week.

Yesterday I tried to drink a green tea instead of latte, but I ended up drinking the two extra espressos later.

Is there something else I can do. I'm afraid I'm damaging my stomach too much, but I can't risk any day without discharging my bowel, cuz all my symptoms gets much worse and I'm almost disabled if I don't go.

The classroom is on the underground level, its thick ancient white walls dimly illuminated by a couple of neons that look older than the Extermination Fleet. For once, I’m early, so I find my assigned seat. I notice that the desks are paired in such a way that one person always faces another. Between my desk and the other, a taped sheet of paper displays the following data:

Alessandro Stuparich

max distance: 10m

strength: 79/90

  
Victoria Vella Silva

max distance: 12m

strength: 83/90

So we have been paired, it makes sense, as we’re likely the two people with the strongest second sight in this class. However, her stats are truly remarkable even for someone who downed an adult Venlil at an age when most haven’t even manifested the talent.  
Honestly, I find myself actually looking forward to this class. Sure, it distracts me from my duties, but after reading her file over and over in the last few days, I want to meet the real thing.  
And here she is, I immediately notice that she isn’t her usual collected self. She’s elegant as always, but her face tells me she’s worried about something. I make a mental note of it. Our known elements haven’t made any moves in the last few days, and she’s clearly physically fine and yet…  
While I’m lost in these thoughts, the trainer has entered the class and introduced himself, I force myself to focus on what he is saying:

“...in couples today. You’ll attempt to use your second sight on each other. While it’s not impossible, and some of you may have already… experimented in private,” he pauses, a flicker of embarrassment crossing his face as some students exchange knowing smirks while others blink in confusion, “it’s not easy. And though it’s useless as a weapon against sapients, not to mention illegal, it’s both a strengthening exercise and a way to dull pain in emergencies.” He stops for a second and continues: “So for the rest of the class I want you to try, but don’t overdo yourselves.” I notice that while saying the last bit he was pretty distinctly looking in our direction.

She looks at me with a mischievous smile and says: “I don’t usually play safe, would you mind if  we up the stakes a little bit?”  
“Hand to hand?”  
“And forehead”

“Deal.”She then proceeds to put her hands palms up on the desk and lean her head toward me. I cover her hands with mine, and we let our heads touch each other. And like this, our duel begins. I close my eyes and try to find a breach. I hit the mental equivalent of a brick wall, while I try to find a breach she tries to pounce. *Nice try*. I find myself smiling while attempting a new angle that get quickly rebuffed. *Interesting—she knows techniques not usually taught to civilians. Not surprising but still remarkable*. I try to fake an attack to catch her off-balance, she doesn’t bite. Now she is trying to do a wide range attack to get me to leave some uncovered spot. *Ah ah you can’t hold it that long, you’ll tire before I budge. Let’s see if you can deal with this…*

\[fast forward half-hour\]

We have been locked in this virtual stalemate for about half an hour at this point, I’m starting to get tired, but I must admit I’m enjoying myself it has definitely been a while since someone has managed to give me a run for my money when it comes to this. Both our palms are becoming sweaty and we are definitely going to need an energy bar after this, but we go on. 

\[skreck\]

I quickly open my eyes, trying to identify the threat and…*ouch!* She pounced like a bird of prey right then and there. *I can’t believe it, she gave me a nosebleed*. She looks at me with a sly smile and says: “You should never get distracted my friend”. We share a quick laugh, but it is interrupted by the teacher: “Now if the two of you have finished showing off, I think we can move to explain a bit of theory before time’s up”. And then to her: “I see what my old mate Vladimir meant when he told me to keep an eye on you, miss, next time when I say play safe I want my instructions to be respected, understood?”   
“Yes, I’m sorry”  
“Good.”

He then dumps a couple of energy bars on the table, and proceeds to move to the front of the class.  The remaining part of the class, he goes on to explain some theory about how this talent works and why most Earth creatures have an inbuilt resistance to it. Since I largely know most of it, I use the time to collect my thoughts about what emerged in the last few days, the huge security breach we discovered, the connection between our target and the murder of my sparring partner’s father. Too many open questions and way too few answers.   
While I’m lost in these considerations, the class ends, I see her rise and collect her things. Before she goes, she turns to me and, with the same mischievous smile, asks: “Would you like to grab a coffee so you can recover from your wounds?""  
*Bold and Forward. It’s probably a bad idea but fuck It and I’ll get an excuse to keep an eye on her*.  
“Sure why not?”

Kaikos, Head of Shadow Caste Intelligence,  Aafa, New Terran Calendar 35-Anubis-36 (Old Human Calendar: 1st October 2048)

It took me days to return to Aafa, but considering how both the Consortium and the Republic have been able repeatedly to breach our communications, it was unfortunately necessary. When I enter the room, I find our leader Tyr somehow even more dismayed than on my last visit. Sadly, I would have to add to the pile of bad news myself.  


Before I start, I ask: 'Have there been any developments in the fight against the mold?”,  


“None unfortunately, it seems to attack only some crops and prefer humid environments. But between overzealous exterminators who keep burning unaffected crops and people transporting it from planet to planet in famine-fueled stampedes, we are nowhere near solving the crisis.”  


“Many planets are growing restless due to the increased rationing.” I state with a sigh.  


“We hoped to create enough unity through the war against the Consortium, but the conflict is stalling, and many planetary governments are starting to question why we are going after those predator-diseased freaks at all. And worse, whereas before they basically ignored each other, it is clear that our two enemies are now talking."" After a series of stressed movements he adds: “Are you sure that neither of them is responsible for the mold?.”  


“We only found traces on ships from other Federation planets. While it's almost impossible at this point to pinpoint its origin, all our sources in the consortium were barely aware of it and all agree in claiming that the Resket will find it too dishonorable as a tactic. As for the predators, while humans have some form of primitive agriculture, this is way beyond their capabilities, and the Arxur have no knowledge of the subject.”

“About them: what news do you have, and how is Operation Supreme Truth progressing?”

“Well, our observations confirm that they are rapidly getting stronger, but they are still not on par with us. But unfortunately they are getting closer, so we revised our estimates to four years.  As for the latter, almost all personnel are in place and so are the materials in a few months and we will be ready to go.”

“Finally, we can’t allow them to surpass us and after that they will not be able to control their instincts.”

“And finally, the federation will once again be united in the fight against predators as it should”.

Here are the choices and why they were made by the director.

Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Ox and Harvar: The director just wanted Professor X and Magneto to be friends by any means necessary.

Don Cheadle as Kilik: The director saw those skits where Don Cheadle played Captain Planet and just knew he had to be in the movie.

Owen Wilson as Hiro: Wow. Just wow.

Helena Bonham Carter as Kim: Um...witches, I guess?

Jennifer Lawrence as Jackie: I think the director was actually tripping balls with this choice.

Tika Sumpter and Zoe Saldaña as The Pots: He thought they would make a great duo. Guess we'll have to wait and see when the films come out.

Marlon Wayans as Sid: The director is apparently a big fan of the Haunted House movies.

Danielle Brooks as Naigus: The director was so disappointed by how little she got in the critically acclaimed masterpiece A Minecraft Movie that he is setting out to give her a bigger role in these movies. Honestly, good on him.

James Marsden as Mifune: James Marsden protected rabbits and hedgehogs, now he is protecting witches.

Glenn Close as Angela: Honestly, the director didn't even explain this one.

Awkwafina as Eruka: Everyone likes Awkwafina, it just made sense.

Robert Pattinson as Free: They thought it would be funny if after years of being associated with bats and vampires, Edward suddenly started playing for the other side of the monster spectrum.

Anne Hathaway as Blair: Catwoman, cat girl witch, you get the picture.

Elizabeth Olsen as Arachne: Spider witch, witch, spiders, Spider-Man, Marvel, Scarlet Witch. Everybody got that? No? Good, moving on.

Margot Robbie as Mizune: Mizune's hair is pink like Barbie.

Matthew Lillard as Joe: Remember when William offered coffee to Mike in the FNAF movie? Do you know who else likes coffee?

The Rock as Sun: Despite my protests, the Rock will indeed be gracing us with his presence, in a role where whenever you look up, he will ALWAYS look down on us like the peasants we all are.

John Cena as Moon: The skies belong to former wrestlers it seems, for much like the Rock, John Cena is always watching.",10,1745571002.0,souleater,1,0.81,False

1k7g1xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k7g1xl/i_think_my_sister_is_trying_to_scam_me/,I think my sister is trying to scam me,"Hi there, this is my first Reddit post so I apologize if it’s not perfect. For background information, I am a university student and I just finished my second year. Last year I lived with my older sister in a basement suite, however, she was never around.  She was at her boyfriend’s place back in our hometown 90% of the time - so basically I was living alone. At the end of last school year I met my now boyfriend, and over the summer we started dating (my sister has never liked him even tho he’s had very few interactions with her always been nice to her). Flash forward to this school year, my boyfriend and I are happier than ever, and obviously spending time together at both of our places. Mine was the go-to spot because once again, my sister was never around and I was basically living alone, and he had two roommates. She and I have never really gotten along, and I was forced into living with her by my parents (who both now regret making me live with her in the first place). My sister has a very um… unique personality (cough cough narcissism). Anyways, she moved out abruptly in November and stuck me paying all the rent, yet still continued to store all of her personal items and furniture in technically “my” house (without my permission). This caused lots of issues. She would accuse me of stealing her things, or moving stuff around (whereas in reality the only time I touched any of her things was to take back items that belonged to me that she took, or to make room for my items within the house I.e., Tupperware). So there were lots of problems with her this school year. Flash forward a few more months and she announces that she is pregnant and will be moving to her boyfriend’s home city in May. Keep in mind, she still has her furniture in my house (table, chairs, coffee table, rug & couch) and still has a bunch of her other furniture in the shared storage room space with the lady who lives upstairs. At this point, my boyfriend and I had decided months ago that next school year, we will be getting me out of the basement suite and moving in together to a new apartment. She has told the both of us that she doesn’t want her kitchen table and that we can have it, so we both agreed. Then she wants to charge me 300 bucks for it. First off, that table is not worth 300. It’s worth 100-150 at most. Second, she says it’s in worse condition from when she moved it into the basement when that is not true. I haven’t touched that table besides rotating it to make more space for the couch my boyfriend and I bought off Facebook marketplace. So if rotating a table causes severe “damage” idk what it is to blame me for wrecking her things. (Not the first time she’s tried to blame me for apparently wrecking her things but oh well). Originally, he and I were like yeah sure that’s fine, and moved on. Then after talking, we decided we don’t need a table that big, so we’re not gonna take hers, and we’d get a smaller one in the fall. A week later he and I both finished finals on the same day, and before going back home, we deep cleaned and packed up all of the belonging in the house (excluding the ones that belonged to my sister because I’m not getting involved in that mess lol). Now, my sister is in her last year of university and still has one final left. So today she texted me if she could spend the extra days after her final in my place, while she waits for her boyfriend to get back from work on Monday. I responded yeah that’s cool, but everything is packed up and there’s no food left in the house just so you know. She responded with that’s fine but as long as her couch is cleaned and i send her the 300 for the beginning of May because that money is paying for the new table for their house. So I responded, we actually decided we don’t want the table anymore so she can do whatever with it. Then I also said, sorry I forgot to clean the couch before I left. That’s when all hell broke loose. She immediately flipped and said she’d charge me the money for “renting her furniture” for the past year (when she left it in my house - so I said to my mom if anything I should be charging her for storing her stuff in my place lol) and then she said she’d add on a cleaning fee because there is a cum looking stain on the couch. I haven’t responded to her text because I think it’s bullshit for me to pay her a “renting” fee for no reason. All because I didn’t wanna buy her table off of her anymore. After she texted me, I showed my mom the conversation and said I am not paying her anything because why would I send her money after I’m not buying anything off of her anymore? My mom agreed with me for not sending her any money, but then a few minutes later, said that she would give me the money for the table. That way either I could sell it, or she or my brother would use it as they are both moving soon too, and that way I could give her the money and let her hissy fit end. Personally, I don’t want to give her money, even if it’s technically not mine. Mainly just because I don’t want to give her the satisfaction of thinking she “won” (it’s always been her lifelong thing to compete with me and “win”/try to make me feel inferior because I’m younger than her - even when we were kids she’d do this). My boyfriend is back in his hometown, and I’m spending the summer there, and it’s a 10 hour drive from my hometown. I came back home for a few days before I left to say goodbye to my mom. So I’m leaving the day after tomorrow, and my mom said I should stop through at my house and clean the couch before continuing to go to his house. Only I don’t think that’s really fair (maybe I’m being selfish in this situation) but I tried cleaning the couch when the stain first got there, and I don’t think I should turn a 10 hour day into a possible 12 hour day just to appease my sister. So I’m wondering, what do I do? Do I bite the bullet and give my sister the money? Do I turn a 10 hour day into a maybe 12 hour day? Or do I say I’m not paying you anything, here’s your table and your stain? To me, it’s seems as though she is trying to scam me for money, so that way I pay (or partially pay for, depending on how expensive it is) for the new table she wants to buy. Which I don’t think is fair. So I’m wondering, what I should do about the money she wants, and what should I do about the stain?

Keep in mind I bought my own couch a few months after she moved out so that way I would have my own to sit on and use to avoid touching her things. And I hardly used the table besides eating off of it every now and then because I usually eat in my room or on my couch. And she specifically said in her text that the money I give her is for the new table she’s buying. I really don’t know if I’m being completely unreasonable or selfish in this whole situation, but any sort of advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",2,1745570414.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

For the past three months, I’ve been manually adding all my expenses — every single item from every receipt, literally everything. I didn’t start doing this out of nowhere — about half a year ago, I began working on an expense tracking app for myself, because money was slipping through my fingers and I wanted at least some control over it.

I tried a bunch of different apps, but none of them felt right — too complicated, too many limitations. That’s when I thought, maybe it’s time to finally learn how to build mobile apps. I’m a web developer, and I’d been wanting to try something new for a while.

So yeah, every month I added some new features and kept tracking my spending — and over time I wanted to get more and more detailed with it. Right now, for example, I have a whole “Groceries” category that’s split into: grains/pasta, bread, dairy, eggs, meat & fish, sweets, vegetables, fruits, cold cuts, coffee & tea, sauces/oils/spices, ready-made food, snacks, and miscellaneous. I always know exactly where my money is going.

It’s also kind of fun to watch how prices change, especially around discounts — like when they first bump the price and then do a “discount,” so it ends up being even more expensive. It’s handy to see what meds I’ve bought, when I last saw a doctor, how many pizzas I’ve eaten this month, and so on.

I get that most people probably wouldn’t bother with this — and maybe I’ve gotten a little too into it — but it only takes me 5–10 minutes a day, and I really like the result. I’ve become way more mindful about how I spend.

What do you think about this kind of budgeting? Could you do it too?

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Two hours and 3 cups of coffee in and I’m sort of figuring stuff out.

Done:
- Digital key set-up on the phone successfully
- Car added to the MyAudi app
- Phone connected, CarPlay enabled
- Kick boot enabled (initially suggested the feature didn’t exist but then the toggle suddenly ungreyed and is working
- DAB favorites stored
- Memory seat stored (for me)
- Battery conservation mode enabled to charge to 80% max

To do:
- Add my wife as a user so it memorises her seat settings. No idea how to do this. Seems she needs a MyAudi account first
- Enable the key card. It’s too early in the morning for me to be able to comprehend the relationship between key card and digital key. More coffee needed
- Set up profiles
- Set up themes
- Play around with light settings etc

One thing I really can’t figure out is the car’s data connection. It is clearly connected via mobile internet as it has updated a couple of apps (e.g. Alexa), downloaded themes and connects to the app. However when I try to install extra apps from the store (e.g. Octopus) it tells me I need to activate a data plan. I’ve tried to do this in the app but just get a never-ending spinner.

I assumed the car came with a data plan as standard, at least for 2-3 years. I’m out of range of house WiFI at the moment. Any ideas???

When I visited previously about a year ago, the taste of almost everything was very good but this time it was an utter disappointment. 
Began with starters - Barbeque chicken was dry, fish was okay, 1 set of prawns were decent but the later ones were not completely cooked. 
Sides including chilli chicken, crispy corn were better than the Cajun potato and pineapple. 
We asked for spiced pineapple and theu said it'll take about 20 mins, we agreed and waited for a while but the result was inedible. Pineapple was raw and the spice was not good at all. 

Then we looked at the main course and it was noting sort of special, seemed like a marriage buffet with Dal, paneer, gatta, and assortment of breads and rice. 
Dessert was no different either we tried coffee creme brulee and it was on the bitter side, All other pastry and cakes were tasting like mass produced items with that different industrial smell(ykwim). 

Now coming to Asian food festival, the highlight event. It saved the day. There are lot of things to try from Japanese, Thai, Korean and other Asian cuisines. If you've never tried Sushi this is a good starting point (I tried my first sushi here and kind of liked it). Next time I'll try some specific sushi place for sure. There are exotic meats on demand (squid, crabs, lobster, octopus, rabbit, duck and many others). There are decent vegetarian options too including some dishes we might not get easily in NCR ( 3 pepper bamboo curry) it was something very new to me. There were Mango based dishes and drinks which people can try as it was interesting. 

Overall verdict - can go for just the Asian food part, as normal Barbeque was not worth it. ",2,1745569403.0,NCR_Foodies,2,1.0,False

From what I heard it's actually what most of the blue collar workers in the US drink. It's also like the cheapest brand of coffee you can buy in most shops in the US from what I observed.

What ever it is, I absolutely used to love Folgers coffee. I used to make it in a french press. I am not a coffee snob. I just love Folgers.

I have returned back to India, I am missing Folgers very badly.

What I learnt in recently is that they mix, Chicory in coffee powder here in India. Which if you are making coffee in a coffee filter tastes great. But I don't use a filter to make coffee.

1k7fsa4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7fsa4,Slowlane Cafe at Ellerslie,"Went to slowlane cafe in Ellerslie today. This is our second time going here. The first time we went, we got cabinet food (the basque cheese cake and the biscoff cinny bun), and coffee which was good. 

The service on our first visit was BAD. We have to pay at the till to put our order through, no problem. But they don’t give us any table number or order number and just asked us in which general direction are we seating. They gave us the cheesecake directly over the counter so all good. But the coffee and the biscoff cinnamon bun was nowhere to be seen after 20 minutes. 

I went up and asked where’s the rest of the order. The person behind the counter said “we were looking for you but you weren’t sitting where you said you were”. I explained that as we said, we were sitting outside by the long benches which should be obvious since there was only us and another group on the other bench that’s right up against the glass wall/window.

So he gave me the cinnamon buns, great. I asked him, “how about the coffee?“ he looked confused, “did you order coffee?”. At that point I died inside a little. 

I showed him the bank transaction since he didn’t give us a receipt or order number. The guy at the counter frantically looked for the ticket on a bunch of stacked finished ticket by the coffee machine and found it and requested one of the barista to make it asap. 

The service team needs coordination training. Closing a dine in ticket because they can’t be bothered to look for the customer is RIDICULOUS. Maybe give us table numbers? Or a receipt? Anything to make it easier for your staff to find customers.

As other reviewers have stated, we were not given any water, napkins or utensils. That’s not a big deal, perhaps it’s self service but if it is they should make it clear upon arrival.

Maybe we didn’t get a table number because we didn’t order any big dish and perhaps it was just a bad day so we decided to give slowlane another chance.

Today on our second visit we got actual kitchen food, the slow benny, which is their take on a classic benny but it’s served with a chinese bao bun instead. 

We got the crispy pork belly with gochujang sauce as our protein. As you can see in the picture attached, the bun arrived at our table severed which was disappointing to see and a trail of poached white egg dripping off the side of the plate (yuck?). I believe that these buns are the frozen premade ones (of which I dont have any issue with) that requires you to steam it before serving to make it plump and pillowy. 

Now obviously that it was broken off when it got served to us, they couldnt be bothered to steam it long enough or well enough for it to not be broken??!! The bao bun tasted dry and heavy. 

We ordered 2 of the same exact item and both portions came with defect bao buns. Portion size was also quite miserable. They costed $27.5 each. At the very least, the service today was decent. They still didn’t give us table numbers but our food actually came.

Still big issue on coffee wait time though. By the time I finished my dish, my coffee arrived. Literally wtf Slowlane.

Don’t bother coming here unless you’re ready to wait.

1k7fs5y,https://i.redd.it/pooyr6zexxwe1.jpeg,Why is there an Ajusshi as a high Schooler in Weak Hero? (Rant),"Okay, I’m watching Weak Hero Class 1 right now, and everything was going great—intense fights, solid acting, actual high school vibes—until bam, Beom Seok shows up and suddenly I feel like I’m watching a grown man crash a school reunion he was never invited to. Like, why does he look like he just clocked out from his 9-to-5 corporate job and accidentally wandered into a school uniform?

I Googled it—he’s 29 now so I guess he was 26 or 27 when it aired, which isn’t ancient or anything, but he legit looks like someone’s tired homeroom teacher who’s been through three divorces and now supervises detention. Meanwhile, Suho and Si-eun actually look like high schoolers! Most of the cast fits the part, but then there’s Beom Seok with that full-on ajusshi energy, and I just can’t unsee it.

Episodes 5 and 6 are basically his spotlight and I’m trying to stay invested, but all I can think is: “Why is this uncle still here? Did the PTA approve this casting?” It’s so distracting I need a second drama just to recover.(read season 2)

Casting directors, I beg—give the man a coffee and let him play a teacher next time. Please don’t cast guys/girls in dramas who absolutely don’t look like a high schooler! Most Koreans are youthful looking and there’s such a big pool of talented younger-looking casts out there! Cast them! 

PS: I am not saying they should cast literal teenagers. Age group 20-25/26 is good for high-schoolers but they should fit into the “High Schooler looking” category, that’s all!",0,1745569196.0,kdramas,26,0.45,False

I bought a coffee maker from a girl who was selling stuff on this sub. The coffee maker is working fine, so no problem there. But right after the deal, I messaged her on WhatsApp just to say thanks — and found out she blocked me. Then I checked Reddit, and she blocked me here too.

I didn’t even complain or ask for anything. I just wanted to say thank you. So I don’t know why she did that. Maybe she’s scared that her stuff is faulty or just doesn’t want to talk after selling.

Whatever the reason, it felt really weird. So if you're planning to buy something from someone here, just be careful. **Check the item properly before you pay**, because once you buy it, they might just disappear like this.

Hope this helps someone. Stay safe out there!",5,1745569151.0,nashik,13,0.73,False

Anyone Faced Similar Situations?,"So here’s the thing. I usually don’t mind helping out someone who looks like they’re genuinely struggling. If I have a bit of extra cash on me, I am happy to give. At the end of the day, if their story is fake or they use the money for something else, that is on them, not me. I gave it with good intentions. Usually, I will give about Rs.500 at most.

But what really annoys me is when helping someone turns into an uncomfortable and borderline harassing experience. Instead of walking away thinking ""I did a good thing,"" I end up thinking ""Why won’t this bugger just leave me alone?""

Two experiences stand out clearly in my mind.

Beggar or Scammer Number One (During COVID)
This guy looked genuinely desperate. He even told me he would clean my house if needed. He really seemed like he needed help, so I gave him Rs.2000. Just to be clear, he didn't clean my hosue. 
Turns out he lived nearby, and every time I saw him after that, it was one sad story after another. One day he even asked me for Rs.10000.
Gone were the days of offering to work. He just expected handouts. I wanted to confront him and tell him not to talk to me again, but I left town for work.
When I came back, it was like he had no memory of me at all.

Beggar or Scammer Number Two (Today)
I was walking into Fab and it was boiling hot outside. I was super thirsty and noticed a beggar who looked like he was really suffering in the heat.
I walked up and asked if I could get him something to drink. I expected him to ask for a water bottle. Instead, he asked for iced coffee. Fine, fair enough.
Then he said he needed three. One for him and two for his brothers. I sighed but agreed to it. My salary had just come in so I was feeling generous.

When I came out with the iced coffees, he asked if I could give him Rs.3000 for his younger brother’s school shoes. I didn’t have any cash on me, so I showed him my empty wallet.
Then he asked me if I could go to the bank and withdraw money. I said I was in a rush, but he kept pushing.
He said ""Aiyo, can’t you help me just a little more?"" I was thinking bro, I just bought you three iced coffees.

Then he asked for one more small favour. He wanted another iced coffee for his mother. I was already losing patience, but I still did it.
As I was walking away, he asked again if I could go to the ATM. I told him no and started leaving. And then he hit me with a guilt trip, saying ""Wow, I can’t believe you won’t help me out.""

I just wanted to help someone out who was clearly struggling in the heat, and I walked away feeling completely drained and used.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I still believe in helping people in need, but things like this really make you think twice.",16,1745568832.0,srilanka,10,1.0,False
