My fiancé [F36] and I [F32] recently got engaged after dating for a little over 2 years. Up until the proposal I was completely on board with marriage. We'd talked about it, I knew it was coming, we'd had plenty of discussions about having a future together, so when she popped the question, I said yes. 

Since that day, I've been riddled with anxiety. I'm filled with all these new thoughts about whether or not we really work well together, whether we're compatible in a way that we can have a successful life-long marriage, and I just don't know what to do. I NEVER had these thoughts before she proposed and now I can't get them out of my head. At the same time, I can't tell if my doubts are rational or if I'm self-sabotaging or having normal pre-marriage jitters. Before I get into it, we are planning to do premarital counseling and I'm strongly considering doing some solo sessions as well, but I'm hoping to get some preliminary advice or get some first-hand experiences from Redditors on whether these differences between us are normal and workable in a marriage or if we're setting ourselves up for failure.

1. Our lifestyles are a bit different. I am a very clean eater, she is much more lax with her eating habits and would eat pretty unhealthily if I didn't cook healthy meals for us. I don't drink much and she likes to drink, usually socially, but sometimes alone here and there throughout the week. I worry about the long-term effects her habits will have on her health and what kind of example would be set for any future kids we have (to be clear, I don't think she has a drinking problem, like she doesn't get DRUNK, just buzzed. But definitely an unhealthy level of drinking takes place throughout the week). I want a partner that stays active with me even later in life, though for her this isn't as big of a priority. I like to have no-screen times, especially when eating or first thing in the morning and would prefer doing non-screen-focused things when we have time to relax at night a couple times a week. She likes being on her phone throughout the day while she's eating, first thing in the morning before getting out of bed, any free time she has, and when she's relaxing at night. Even when we’re at a family gathering or something, she’ll be scrolling through TikTok on her phone, it drives me nuts 😅

2. Our partnership doesn't feel balanced. I do a lot for my fiance in terms of doing acts of kindness for her here and there throughout the week. I like getting her little gifts, doing projects around the house that she'll appreciate, taking care of some of her tasks for her when I know she's having a busy day, etc. I also do all of our cooking, laundry, and the majority of our cleaning. On special occasions I do a lot of planning ahead to make the day special and enjoyable for her. I LOVE surprising her with nice gestures and seeing her face light up, and it's a win-win because it makes me happy to make her happy. Doing this kind of stuff for me (or others in general), however, isn't really her thing. She operates in a way that, now that I'm having all these thoughts, feels self-centered. She never offers to help me make dinner, she sits on the couch on her phone waiting for me to tell her it's ready (I've told her I'd appreciate if she offered to help every now and then). She doesn't take initiative to dust or sweep around the house since she feels I'm the one that prefers a higher standard of clean, so it shouldn't be on her to keep it that way. (Like, she genuinely doesn’t find the house to be dirty, so it doesnt cross her mind to clean it. I’m talkin dust bunnies under the coffee table, little dirts and leaves tracked in from outside, a thin layer of dust on the tv cabinet, etc. nothing crazy, and to some this isn’t dirty, but to me it’s something that should be cleaned up.) She rarely, if ever, does anything extra to make me feel appreciated throughout the week outside of hugs, kisses, and cuddles. Of course I appreciate those things dearly, but I also feel like she's doing those things because, in that moment, SHE wants hugs and kisses. She says ""I love you"" often, but, to me, her actions don't make me feel like she genuinely thinks about my happiness like I think about hers. ie love as a feeling vs love as an action. I feel like she operates in ""ME""-mode, whereas I operate in ""WE""-mode. 

We've had some heart-to-hearts about this, mainly about the domestic chores and wishing she'd help out more around the house. Things get better for a short while, but never last.

Outside of these issues, we get along well. She makes me laugh, she gets along with my family, and we’re both completely comfortable around each other. Before the proposal, I was excited to share a life with my best friend, but now that I’m in it, it’s like my brain is listing out reasons to run away.

Has anyone else experienced this with their partner? Are these things that can be worked through? I overthink EVERYTHING, I’m terrified calling off the wedding over something that shouldn’t be a big deal in actuality.",1,1733014682.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I got a blood test done recently, doc prescribed me vitamin D, told me to buy B complex, and said I should try a gluten elimination diet. I was sceptical at first because lots of people would say that more tests should be done and celiac should be confirmed before an elimination diet, but now I really think it’s the only way for me to do something about it at the moment. 

main symptoms: !!

•constant fatigue
•very bad anxiety
•brain fog so bad I feel like I have dementia 
•getting irritable and mad a lot 
•absolutely no energy ever (hence my now coffee addiction)
•poor circulation (legs turn red/purple if I stand up for more than 5 minutes)
•nails being thin, see through, and breaking like paper (and literally growing upwards)
•eye sclera is blue (low iron)
•heavy heavy period (I bleed completely through tampax super plus tampons in half an hour that is not normal and they’re supposed to last for at least 4 hours what do I even do !!)
•canker sores
•looks like I have gum disease 🔥🔥

also lastly this is probably worth mentioning ^^ when I used to eat sugar it made all of these things I listed a lot more intense so now I don’t eat it at all !

last thing actually! I’ve been on lexapro before for depression (10mg) and it did nothing! I read that celiac can make medications and such non effective which is actually why I decided that I am going GF soon because I want to go back on it but if I still eat gluten I think it’s gonna be the same again, also I have chronic back pain (forgot to include that) which no ibuprofen or anything works even the slightest

I can't even walk over to say hello to them when they visit or phone them without him pitching a temper tantrum and coming up with something to be upset about.

I see people posting their trophy X5 purchases and can't wait to join the squad. There's just one thing, I don't know what part of the country people are getting their X5's, but inventory in the DMV area or with my spec's are either on the higher side of mileage or price. 

I've been keeping my eye out for a CPO or preowned X5 2021-2023 (keen on having some runway with the factory warranty after purchase) for the past several months. CPO has been nearly impossible to find with the specs I've been looking for so I've widened my search to preowned (yes, fully plan on a PPI for those).

Crazy miles; I think it was all highway but like that its CPO, which gives me piece of mind. 

Carvana 2023 BMW X5 xDrive40i | **$56,590 + $1,990 Shipping | 15,308 miles** | Black Sapphire Metallic + Coffee Sensafin | Packages: Executive, M Sport, Staggered 22's, Driving Assistant Professional, Climate Comfort, Parking Assistant, Sport Seats, Harmon Kardon. (has a few noted chips and scratches in the paint, no tow hitch). Has anyone bought a X5 from Carvana? Favorite interior. 

Dealership Pre-owned 2022 BMW X5 xDrive40i | **$45,662 + (shipping from SC) | 42,492 miles** | Phytonic Blue Metallic + Cognac Vernasca Leather | Packages: Premium, Luxury Seating, M Sport, 22's, Driving Assistant Professional, Climate Comfort, Parking Assistant and Towing. This just got into the dealership so im still waiting on a video and more pics. Has anyone bought out of state and arranged for it to be shipped? Otherwise, I suppose I could catch a cheap flight and drive it back, but kinda hate to put those type the miles on it. 

I've honestly had a hard time finding these packages + M Sport with full paint better than the above. Ideally it'd be under $50k and \~30k miles, but the above have been the best I've been able to find. 

I've been reading other reddits and know to be checking for ""delete from build,"" etc.

\_\_\_\_

March 2024, I had a ""Love at first Sight"" with my plumber.

He came to change the water meter valve. I had just decided to delete all dating apps & online male contacts. I had told myself : ""next time I'll meet someone, it will be in everyday real life"". Well, the bell rang something like 4 minutes after, for a plumbing appointment that I had absolutely forgotten about.

His deep black eyes, his humour, his sensitivity ... Something happened instantly, on both sides. My flat is tiny so we exchanged a bit as he was working, then bonded around coffee at my window. He told me about the darkness in his life. I won't go into details. But a lot of tragedies had happened to him in the past few years (and whole life). He also read in me like in an open book. He mentioned he was separated, had a 16 years old daughter. Well, I texted him the next day, writing how he was such a sunshine. He replied that I had cast my light over him as well. Then, I was away for 2 weeks ( a job training ) during which we texted and called each other; not flirting, just talking about life. I would also read him passages from the book I was reading.

When we met again, we just fell into each other's arms. It had never been that natural for me. We kissed for the very first time; it felt like it had been that way forever. Right after that first kiss, he sat me down and said ""Ok. Look, I must tell you something. I don't want to hurt you. I still live with my daughter's mother.I am waiting for my daughter to graduate, I must finish my mission with her"". (More info he shared about his relationship later : ""We've been together 27 years. She's amazing but we burned all our cartridges."" There was also betrayal on both ends. )

I was really disappointed by my lack of luck. I already found myself in front of similar situations in the past, had feelings, even, for unavailable men; ALWAYS refused to be the other woman. It just doesn't turn me on, I need to feel like the priority, and special. Yet, I thought... I'll go with it for a little while. This man intrigues me just too much. I went for it for a few other reasons, I think. First, I thought: We are TOO different. He's a plumber from Marseille who has been in jail, who had such a tough life; I come from Versailles and have been sheltered a lot (although I've gone on solo adventures around the world). Second, I was cheated on in my most important relationship a few years prior, and it had honestly broken in me that ""idealisation"" of love, relationships and faithfulness.

That's how a wonderful yet imperfect 9 months long story started. A sincere Love story. Yes, in the end, it became emotionally unmanageable for me (for the last few months). I had fallen deeply in love with that man, but I do want to be a legitimate girlfriend, and also to build a family with someone. Therefore, our story just could not work anymore.

This is today : Long story short, there was this past month one hell of a strange chain of events :  
I've been wanting to leave Marseilles for a while, and turns out I lost my job (that I hated). My MM and I had arrived at that Dead End. I was also losing my one best supportive friend in Marseilles... AND, at that same moment, my parents offered me to move in their canal boat, in a city quite far from Marseille, where there's some interesting professional path for me!!!  
Icing on the cake : my MM lost his driving license and will get an electronic bracelet in january.

It was like ALL THE STARS had aligned to bring that man and I together, and now those Stars were changing alignment to take us apart and let us heal. We both see it that way. We are a little heartbroken, but we know it's just for the best. 3 weeks away at my parents really helped contemplating all this.

From the bottom of my heart, I don't regret anything. I never want to be a mistress EVER again, but it was an amazing story. I was also introduced to such an interesting world; I've met many of my MM's cousins and childhood friends, all of them Big Hearted ""ex baddies"" ; who would me in their arms, with tears in their eyes, saying ""we've never seen him like this. Yet he can't offer more to you... at least for now"".  
It was also a lot of roadtrips, singing crazily old-school French songs (Joe Dassin or Francis Cabrel)...

And I don't know if we'd even work. We are still from such different worlds, I hate various aspects of his lifestyle; although it feels like our souls are made from the same matter (we both feel that). I'm smiling, let out a giggle as I'm recalling all this relationship's flaws...  
I will never forget him.

I'm spending one last month here in Marseilles to prepare my things and move away. Yes, we do still meet a little, slowly saying goodbye. Yes I'm still suffering from the situation some days and cannot sleep. But I know and feel I am soon free from this. I know I am leaving & my soul has already left the city and this relationship. I honestly even wish him to stay with his amazing and beautiful wife, to make it work. I've come to understand his family is his true Pillar in the world of deep misery, tragedies and crimes he's been raised in. She's strong, stable, much more than him, or me possibly (my life is always an adventure, ever changing, not very stable). He still says sometimes that when his mission is over, he'll come find me on my boat. It does make me smile ... Maybe it comforts him to think of that.

I do think our MM often truly love us. Yet there are various definitions of love.  
I do think our MM are sincere in what they say; although it might always just remain escapism..

anyway, mostly just trying to scare up another panther encounter in the same area, SE of braithwaite manor. saw another a little later. maybe next day (game), saw another red dot appear on my map, so jumped off of jojo (just in time) got the panther in my crosshairs. i fired, but missed the sweet spot. charged, and dead.

oh well. 

so after reading some of the [no-go posts this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/s/eHL0gAqo0E), i spent some special moments in the swamp. i found a few orchids, and did some gator avoiding. even in the daytime, the deep swamp is scary AF. my horse bolted with all my gear. i would whistle, jojo would flash, but not come, so i had to go get him. went slowly, carefully. i would hear what i think are signals (a sort of whistle) from the swamp people, night folk, scary voodoo people. i would try to see them with my tracking vision, but i bet they are undetectable. does anyone know for sure? i was able to find a few, and kicked the shid out of them, but more kept coming! then as i got closer to my horse, i saw that she was being held by one of THEM. i bum rushed him to ride away, but there were too many. i died. i seek revenge. 

also upon respawn, i lost $124. and went back in the direction i was headed. i found a stranger in a bog shack, he was being hospitable, but i didn’t trust him. i threw fire bottles at his shack. he died. i went to check the loot, and burned to death.

Hello there !! As the title says, I am looking for some casual chat partner here, easier said than done to be honest , but if you are here, hopefully we will connect. 

I am 39, a working professional, who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on to as most of us do. I am married and father to a  wonderful daughter who I love to the moon and back. 


So what am I seeking here ? Good question and to be honest as an answer I am just trying to explore and discover. Yes at this age I am. I have been working rigorous for last 15 years non stop and have given my all to my family and finance, but last few months something clicked in me and I have decided that may I shall pay a bit of attention discoveries outside my monotonous life I have been living. 

Please do not judge me as cheater. I love my wife and family to the core, but this whole thing is about me and I don't want to give  explanation about it to anyone else, perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view. 

I am a shy and introverted personality with minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say.
I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch lot of sci fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am. 

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chat about anything, yes anything (sfw/nsfw/mix) and if we hit it off, I don't mind it to be a long term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere from the world ! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

1h3qwri,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1h3qwri/im_emotionally_constipated_please_help/,"I'm emotionally constipated, please help. ","My friends give really biased advice about love, so I naturally turn to the Redditors. I'm not really good at expressing myself, nor good at grammar, but I hope I got the message across. This is kind of a vent/ confession/ advice. All I really want to know is how to be a better friend to this person, who just happens to be my crush. 

Here goes nothing.

To my Crush,

I like you. I don't really know where it began. When I noticed you as something more than an acquaintance. I just thought you were cool, now it's becoming a crisis of character.

You're really smart and interesting, and you're very much the opposite to me. I admire the way to could talk to others, and how you made friends with everyone easily, even if your personalities didn't match up. You instantly make people smile just by meeting your eyes, or at the very least comfortable. I dont know if you realised that. I honestly wish I could do the same for my own friends. Because of you, I notice how you take care of others so genuinely. Engaging with others interests and with an empathetic ear. Hanging around and chatting about the mundane, even if it's difficult for you as a foreign language. It's cute and frustrating to overhear.

I like your commitment to stay true to your heritage, not ashamed to say you're foreign. Unlike me, who has been running away from her reality. Because of people mocking me at a young age, I didn't learn my family's tongue, for the sake of not being an outcast. Now, where society gas changed to welcome and celebrate different nationalities, I struggle to fully relate to my national brothers and sisters, even my cousins and relatives. Yet you, a foreigner with a very obvious accent, managed to fit in so easily, with almost everyone. What I was teased and harassed for in younger years, you were accepted and endeared to all now. You managed to accomplish something in a few years that i have yet to do. I have lived in this country my whole life, yet I'm still struggling. It's incredible. 

If I tried to be more like you when I was younger, maybe we could be closer. If I ws more confident in myself, maybe we would be in a closer relationship. Communicate in a language we are both comfortable in. It must be difficult talking with a filter on all your words, and I want to be a person everyone can talk to, including you. Maybe I'm a bitch for only judt realising thanks to you how difficult it is for foreigners (like my family) to live here speaking in a whole new way - not being understood fully and being prejudiced against. I'm a whitewashed idiot, who lies about her skill in our language so she doesn't embarrass herself in front of our mutual national friends. I'm currently trying to relearn a language i should have known since birth, but it's demoralising every time I hear you speak so casually between lessons to your friends abroad. Im still trying, though in secret to surprise my family, and to catch up with my lies. I know nothing, skilled at nothing, but you balance being a polyglot and amazing grades. I can't even get a B in a single subject. We are the same ethnicity, but can't be any more different.

Writing this makes it seem I'm jealous rather than in love, but I guess crushes really change people. Made me realise how pathetic I am compared to you. I like you, but you'll never look my way. Crush, I have only known you for a few months, and I suppose it's your fault for being so damn endearing, but I really like you. You can't help but catch my eye, and every day I find myself smiling a little more over something you did. Whether thar be winning a match in sports, or scolding my friends for not understanding ""simple maths"", it's scarily endearing. I hope you find someone who complements you, because you are truly are somebody worth loving.

From, 
Coffee Bun :)

To Reddit, thank you for reading. I don't know what to expect from the comments. Any advice on how to handle this crush? I'm embarrassed just thinking about it. I just need to know how to approach in a way that will be comfortable for him. So he knows its okay to confide in me, even when his best friends are afar. 
I'm aware that my confession is dripping in low self esteem, but I have been going to therapy for it. They say healing is a slow process. 
Right now, I just want to be friends with my crush as he's literally the nicest guy ever. Super cool. Nerdy Cute. Extroverted. Plays Basketball and likes Maths. TMI: My last crush literally was a bully and made fun of me repeatedly for liking him, so I think I picked a good one this time. Idk. What should I do? I don't really talk about romance with my friends as I'm a bit awkward, so Internet strangers 

Thanks again. Be as harsh as you want. I hope he doesn't find out. Might delete later.

I have a need for 2 separate coffee setups and am trying to figure out how to sort them out.

I need one setup for WFH and weekends (4-5 days a week) at one place and one for making a quick latte to-go (2-3 days a week) at the second. I plan to use the WFH setup as a base point to build off of with better grinder and be my play station while the other needs to be fairly brainless (I will still single dose it, but dont plan to tweak the setup much).

I currently have a Breville Oracle Touch that I have been using for years now and recently snagged a Barista Pro for $500 at marshals (was hoping for a bambino plus for $250, but is what it is). My question is, which of these would you use as the play setup and which would you use as the brainless one? The way I see it is

Oracle Touch

* Better brewing system w/ 58mm basket, but unsure about control for pre-infusion and the like
* Cant seem to do manual steam and the auto hasn't worked great for years
* Grinding into a shaker is annoying since you need the porta-filter in it to grind

Barista Pro

* Manual steaming (without a boiler), which appeals to my tinker side greatly
* Worse brewing system (ostensibly at least)
* 54mm (so less basket options, but I like fuller body anyways)

I wont be getting an additional grinder immediately, but swapping which machine is in which location inst really going to be an option so I wanted to get opinions.",1,1733013496.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1h3qoqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeIndia/comments/1h3qoqa/monthly_thread_for_childfree_indians_seeking/,Monthly Thread for Childfree Indians Seeking Friendships,"Hi, CFI!

Welcome to our Monthly Friendship Thread, where childfree Indians can connect and build friendships. Whether you're looking for friends in your city or online, this is the place to be!

You can also connect more organically in [CFI's only official chat channel](https://chat.reddit.com/room/!QjYaQOe1QEW4oYdhE8OxMg%3Areddit.com)—already home to over 1,800 members! Struggling to join? Shoot a DM to any mod.

*Processing gif b668qgdhaqvd1...*

A Few Things to Note:

1. **No CF4CF**: 'CFI Friendships' threads are for those seeking only platonic friends, either IRL or online. This is not the place to seek romantic interests; for that, you can create CF4CF posts on Sundays instead. If you spot any lovebirds in the wrong nest, feel free to give us a heads-up! **Stay Safe!** Use common sense and caution when talking to any stranger online.

1. **DM Etiquette:** By commenting here, you agree to be open to DMs from those seeking CFI friends (strictly platonic, unless you also post a CF4CF). Unsolicited dating or creepy messages will lead to a ban and a report to Reddit admins.
2. **Share About Yourself:** Help others get to know you better. Share your age, hobbies, city, gender (though our TwoX comrades might want to be cautious due to unsolicited attention). 
3. **Posting Flexibility:** Feel free to create posts outside of this thread to seek childfree Indian friends - use our new post flair 'CFI Friendships'. The CF4CF rules don’t apply to friendship seekers, so you can post any day, in any format, as long as you follow the other rules of CFI (see the sidebar for rules).
4. **City-Based Groups:** There are various city-based CF groups (none affiliated with this subreddit) on Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or Facebook. Give those a try too!
5. **Meetups:** We encourage you to join or host a city-wide CF meetup if you can.

Examples:

* *""Hey CFI, It's Keanu here (yes, the one and only), dodging diapers like I dodge bullets in The Matrix. Living in Mumbai these days and looking for pals to ride motorcycles with or discuss philosophy over coffee. Drop a DM if you're into low-key hangouts and high-key debates!""* 
* *""Greetings, CFI! Bruce here from Gotham. By night, I fight crime; by day, I'm just your average billionaire. Into tech, martial arts, and nocturnal expeditions. Seeking fellow night owls who appreciate justice, complex gadgets, and the occasional brooding on rooftops. If you're up for discussing philosophy or the ethics of vigilante justice over coffee, let's connect over DM.""*
* *""Hello CFI! It's Vidya Balan here, loving life and breaking stereotypes one role at a time. I'm all about deep conversations and meaningful connections, but for now, I'm keeping things virtual. Not quite ready for in-person meetups—think of it as the interval before the big finale. If you're into thoughtful chats and connecting from the comfort of your own space, let's link up over DM!""*

1h3qol2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h3qol2/aitah_for_suggesting_my_friend_stop_ordering/,AITAH for suggesting my friend stop ordering expensive items at restaurants? (sorry for long post) ,"i (19f) have a friend group of 7 people, most weeks we all go to a local restaurant for a meal to catch up as we are all uni students and only have free schedules at the one time a week we go out (give or take a member or two week to week). we all mostly only order “basic” menu items like the classics: burger, chicken tenders, pasta etc plus a drink or two per person, nothing fancy or too expensive. however, one member always orders at least a fancy cocktail, a special on the menu or a more expensive item like a steak or seafood dish and side dish. these items are all some of the most expensive items on the menu with steak usually being around 30£, side 7/8£ and multiple cocktails equalling 15£ so her items alone are over 50£ whereas the rest of us usually are less than half of this. this wouldnt be an issue to anyone if we all payed for our respective items, but we split the bill equally among who is present. this causes problems for quite a few members as juggling uni and trying to work as much as possible to pay for expenses and are strict on budgeting to survive week to week. therefore the added expense of paying for our friend to have the most expensive items on the menu add an extra 10+£ on their budget that could instead go towards food or paying off loans for example. 
what makes me the ah is that i have known this girl the longest, we arent close but i get along well with her and obviously consider her a friend. so when this issue was raised by the majority of the group one night when she couldn’t attend our weekly dinner and the bill was significantly cheaper, i was nominated to confront her about this and ask her to maybe consider the fact that her items were putting a bit of a financial burden on others and maybe keep the extravagant meals to solo meals or with family etc. 
 me and this friend went out for a coffee so i could speak to her privately about this to not put her on the spot or anything. when i brought up the issue she claimed that she only ordered those items because “its split equally so its fair” and that the people struggling to afford the bill should “starve or work more” to afford it. when i pointed out that her response was extremely ignorant and entitled i got quite heated as i was in the knowledge that she didnt know these peoples struggles that they faced to get into uni let alone afford to feed her expensive taste and that if working more was an option for then they would obviously take it. 
the part that i think makes me the ah is i made a comment about her parents paying her way into uni and that without their money and the privilege this gave her she would be in the exact same situation as what she was putting her friends in and that she would be “nowhere and nobody” without being spoiled, entitled and arrogant by way of her parents sheltering her from the real world and not teaching her how lucky she really was.

This is my first serious relationship. I have always been very happy single, am set up well financially and have enjoy living alone. 

My partner is really, really supportive of me, but he is quite messy. I had the red flags before we moved in - his car is an absolute tip - there are empty coffee cups full of mould all over the back floor for example. His room was also pretty messy, but he would try to clean it up before I came. He doesn’t have depression or ADHD or anything like that.

He doesn’t expect me to do more housework than him, but I frequently do because he thinks housework should only be done once a week, whereas things like vaccuuming etc I really feel need to me done more than once a week. He frequently leaves his used condoms on his bedside table for longer than 24 hours, despite the fact that there is a bin 30cm away. He also put food containers in the bin, despite the fact that I have asked him to reserve the kitchen bin for food waste. He also frequently leaves his drawers half open and makes out that I am being unreasonable when I ask him to close them, because it takes no time and it makes the apartment seem so much nicer.

When he cooks he gets food on his hands and smears it on things. Recently I noticed the olive oil bottle (which is a decorative bottle than I specifically decanted the oil into) had food residue smeared all over it. I very calmly told him and asked him if he could be more careful. He told me there wasn’t anything he could have done to prevent it because he didn’t notice. I asked him if he could try to be more mindful of the smearing and he said there was nothing that he could do because he had forgotten. He also then brought up that once I used the toilet at night with my period and there was blood left on the seat without me realising. I didn’t really feel this was a totally fair comparison as the bleeding is involuntary, but I did say I’d be more mindful.

Another time he did his washing (the first time in months because I normally do it because he just leaves it too long) but then fell asleep while the washing was running and then had to immediately leave the house because he was late for work, which resulted in me having to hang it out for him. When I mentioned this, he said if wasn’t his fault because he fell asleep. I sort of feel like being a grown adult is not falling asleep and leaving your wet laundry in the washing machine for hours, which is what would have happened if I hadn’t been there.

In both these examples I think it’s a bit of a cop out for someone to say that they didn’t do something because they were careless or sleeping, but am I being too picky?",1,1733012626.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I’m in a bit of a long-term challenge with my dating life, so I’d appreciate some insights. Sorry for the wall of text, I’ll provide a tl;dr at the end.

For quite a long time now, I’ve had what I think is an isolated issue with building a connection with women I’ve been interested in. I vary rarely go on dates and even if I offer a casual coffee, they’re very rarely interested. I have had numerous (probably about 100-200) rejections. I wonder if there may be some kind of underlying cause that I could work on, as I’m at a bit of a loss at the moment. I was recently turned down by a girl who I thought would be a decent match (lots in common and she’s a really nice person), which spurred me to make this post.

I’ve consulted several friends who have all said they’re really not sure what the issue is, other than they say “I’m smart” (not 100% sure about that one) and that “I’ll find someone someday” (which I really don’t believe without active effort, especially as a guy).  I have been on dating apps without much success, but I don’t put much stock in those anyway as I’ve found what I value most (and my best features) aren’t really captured in my profile. Physically, I guess I’m average attractiveness, I take care of my health, I’m 5’8” and Asian by ethnicity (though not much else culturally). I do tend to have a preference for smart, quiet, thin women, which I guess narrows the pool somewhat.  

My two careers are in medicine and in my primary interest, and a niche and competitive area of fine arts (I’ll be broad about this one so as to not give too much personal detail), where I have found some success but, more importantly, which I find deeply fulfilling and where I derive a great deal of personal meaning. I love the balance of creativity but also the pursuit of truth that these fields offer- and of course my job as a physician leads to a financial security which I appreciate. Recently, I have been able to focus solely on my art for a while which has led me to meet tons of likeminded people, however I still haven’t established any connections who are interested beyond friendship.

I have a healthy social life with many friends from various backgrounds and age groups. My hobbies include swing and (more recently) salsa dance, where I meet tons of new people. I would take on more hobbies, though frankly, sometimes I worry these would take away my focus on the careers above. I’m well-read and well- travelled. I suppose part of my deep desire for a meaningful relationship comes from my peaceful and happy family situation growing up, which has set a high expectation for my relationships in the future and led me to tie much of my happiness to that relationship, which I wonder may not be a particularly healthy way to go about life. I am socially confident and have only mild hesitancy striking up a conversation with women and expressing interest.

I have recently been in a 3.5 year relationship which was mostly happy but ended abruptly, with my ex telling me we just “had different priorities for the future” and also that I am prone to “black and white thinking” after she had some counselling for other reasons.  In retrospect, I think the stresses of having my dual career, and her busy career as well, made things a challenge for us. My friends think I have a “serious personality” (probably from my work), and I wonder if my difficulty in “lightening up” may be a factor here as well.

I recently did a test on my core values and what I would appreciate in someone else which revealed that Authenticity, Creativity, Accountability, Beauty and Diligence to be the most important.

Reasons I suspect may contribute to this issue include:

* My tendency to overthink/ overanalyze
* Difficulties communicating the value of what I do to others, i.e. to engage their emotions
* My tendency to invest too much in others, too soon
* My expectations regarding physical appearances (possibly?)
* My slightly narrow interests and possibly a fixed mindset about things
* My generally busy/stressful life and career (I may need to travel frequently and move on occasion)
* Introversion (though I do a bunch of social things and have some leadership roles, I’m just not interested in long parties or going out every night as I sometimes have been)

I really hope to find my person eventually... Any perspectives, opinions, advice or clarifying questions would be very much appreciated. Thanks very much!

1h3qhcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h3qhcd/41m_37f_stay_or_go/,41M 37F - Stay or Go?,"Hi Everyone,

11 years of marriage and 13 years together I found out my wife is dismissive avoidant and it’s fucked me up. 

We have two boys, 8 & 9. 

My wife 37F has been increasing distant over the last two years.  She stopped initiating sex but was receptive to my advances and we had a great intimate life.  She was never physically affectionate really and specified she didn’t like PDA and I respected that.  Six months ago she stopped being receptive to sex. 

I found out she’s been in therapy for a number of years and didn’t tell me, and when I did find out I asked if we needed to talk about us or anything that I was doing and she said no, it was work stress.  

I’ve always checked in with her about it everything was good, if there is anything we need to talk about, and was always told no; things were great. 

About two months ago it came to a head and I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with our marriage and that we needed help. I said that my emotional and intimate needs were no longer being met and I suggested marriage counselling and originally she was receptive.  But she said that she had become accustomed to doing her own thing since we haven’t really spent time together in 7 years since the kids were born, and didn’t really see us as having an issue.  

I brought up that I’ve asked her out on dates and she’s declined. I’ve tried to arrange trips and she couldn’t because of work.  I reminded her at least every 3-4 months I’ve asked her if there was anything we needed to talk about and she always said no. 

I asked her if there was infidelity or if she was gay and she denied both.  She reaffirmed she didn’t want a divorce and wasn’t going to leave.  She said she wanted to talk to her therapist before committing to marriage counselling. 

Nothing was really sorted two weeks later so I asked for an update and she said she didn’t really see the necessity for marriage counselling, or resuming intimacy.  She got mad and just shut down any attempt to talk. 

At this point I started really struggling.  I tried sending flowers to her work. Leaving little gifts around the house. Making her coffee and breakfast in the morning.  Everything just made her turtle. We talked once more where she affirmed she loved me and was attracted to me, but that any attempt at establishing a connection again would take time.  However since that point she’s denied any chance to spend time alone. 

I considered infidelity as a possibility.  While cleaning up our downstairs storage room I found an old iPhone of mine she had used for a few weeks when she broke hers.  I’m not proud of it but I booted it up without wifi and took a look at her old messages. There wasn’t any signs of infidelity, but I found messages with her therapist where she recognized she was avoidant attachment and her therapist affirmed that and the only reason we ended up together is I had my shit together and never really needed her for anything and was independent.  And from the rest of the conversations her staying in this marriage for as long as she has required a lot of work and therapy. 

This has been a bit of a mind fuck as I thought we had a great marriage.  She is a kind and wonderful person and I love her deeply. She is an attentive mother. 

I know she had a rough upbringing with her parents that she hasn’t talked about (alcohol abuse, she had to parent her younger siblings), which fits with DAA. 

So now I’m recognizing that it’s not that she isn’t wanting to meet my needs, she legitimately may not be capable of addressing them at all.  I’ve been walking on eggshells to keep the peace but it’s not sustainable.   If I stay there’s a high probability I will never have my needs met and will have no ability to be vulnerable or talk about my feelings.  But my boys are my world, I’ve put them to bed almost every night for their entire lives, and I can’t imagine a world where I only see them half the time. 

I’ve resigned myself to get through Christmas. Stuff everything down.  I’ve looped in my parents who are down in Arizona for the winter and they’re planning to come back early spring instead of April in case I need to offload the boys.  I’ve spoken to a lawyer in case shit goes sideways and because I brought a house and other assets into the marriage I’d walk away with around $100,000 after the sale of our home and dealing with the shared debt.  I make around $115,000 she makes around $92,000 so support would be fairly minor. 

I’m looking 10 years down the line when the kids are grown and I’m in my 50’s and am married to a woman who never really had my back, was never really my person. 

As I’m writing this things are becoming more clear. But I’d love to hear from some people who have made it work with people who are DAA?",1,1733012409.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Been married a little over 12 years together for 16 just discovering my wife has cheated on me in the last three or four months telling me it’s not about sex. What about that spark of a coworker that came to speak with her her boss two months prior discovered she was crushing on a different coworker, and I confronted her. She said it was nothing and just a friendship and fast forward. I’ve discovered she slept with this man gone down on him at some point, she was fired from the job and told him if they wanted to continue their relationship. He would have to meet her two days a week and step up his game so he did. She has friends telling her if you can get past the sin God is OK with it when I found out about the relationship she lied to me and said it was just lunch and then a kiss and then a blowjob and then three probably 50 sexual encounters Even the possibility of an STD which she’s claiming she got tested and it was nothing it was because he went down on her for too long. I wanna stay together, but I can’t trust her a few weeks ago. We had a date on a Friday night. She said oh I go to this place and get lunch sometimes and I go over there and get coffee. Sometimes I have my own secret life, you guys don’t even know about. She originally told me she met this guy the one she slept with because he saw her at a restaurant said that’s a nice book. Have you read it before made up some big lie and it was a boss who came to talk with her at lunch and within 10 days they were on a date  she likes to do random journaling so every now and then I’ll find a notebook from three or four or 10 years ago and 110 years ago talks about how she was not in love with me and not happy and after she had our kid, the first one she felt like she was a bad mom and randomly constantly saying we’re on a upward or downward, as if I’m not allowed to be sad and happy in the same day. Apparently 1011 years ago when I was training for the rock ‘n’ roll marathon I had a 20 mile training run mind you I’m not a super athlete. It was lots of jogging and walking. She asked if she could ride the bike that I owned and follow me run. She told me she knew how to ride a bike and that it would be OK and I told her it’s gonna be difficult. They’ll be lots of random hills. At some point mile 12 she was slowing me down and I told her just to go and I’ll catch up with her. It was a big loop. She said that really broke her when I yelled at her and I said you lied to me and said you could ride a bike with gears I was under emotional and physical distress, and you were worried about me yelling at you because you lied to me about riding a bike. Apparently she couldn’t find me and was writing all over the place and got blisters on her butt I would’ve just gone back the same way I came from and waited for me. Do I stay with her because of the kids or do I ask her politely to leave? We have a second home I was gonna let her stay in it when the renters were up with their time and have her pay me child support. She constantly said she can’t do it with the kids doesn’t go to the park with us hangs out in the bathroom or in the bedroom by herself she says it’s from stress that I’ve caused and I tell her she has a family out here that can take care of that stress and make her feel loved. She does take some sort of antidepressants. Her mom did commit suicide, which I think is gonna become a genetic factor one of those notebooks from several years ago said I’m back to hurting myself again like old times I really didn’t know about it now I’m trying to think do I stay with her until the kids are old enough or do I try to get rid of her now because of her infidelity we cannot afford a big divorce because we do have debt and we need to keep the houses because we want the children to have a decent lifestyle. My wife and I don’t fight in front of the children anymore. We used to yell now I’m just wondering what do I do? Should I get one of those postnuptial? Should I just say goodbye to her. She got this book about cheating on your husband and parts about it are like normalizing the situation and seeing if you can forgive yourself and seeing if you could be back with your husband and I think to myself whoever wrote this needs to get their face kicked in cheating is never OK.",1,1733012121.0,relationships_advice,4,1.0,False

Ah, BTC and I had a lively day—let me walk you through the twists and turns. Today, I was all about **faking out, consolidating, and keeping traders guessing**. Grab your coffee; let’s dive into the story.

# 1. The Opening Drama (High at $96,575)

Early on, I made a sharp push upward toward **$96,575**, poking just above the 50 EMA (in green) on the 5-minute chart. **Classic liquidity play**—I wanted to see who was hiding their stops around the highs.

* **Who I trapped:**
   * Momentum bulls who thought the breakout was real.
   * Overconfident shorts who got squeezed trying to fade me too early.

But what did I do? **Reverse hard.** That rally wasn’t sustainable without big volume, and as you can see, the volume dried up fast.

# 2. The Mid-Day Grind (Consolidation Zone: $96,000-$96,500)

After the morning drama, I spent **hours chopping around** the $96,000-$96,500 range. Why? Simple—I was building a battleground:

* **What I wanted:** To gather liquidity from traders trying to guess my next move.
* **What I gave them:**
   * Hope for a breakout above $96,500 that didn’t come.
   * Frustration for bears who kept shorting too low and got squeezed just enough to stay uncomfortable.

My RSI stayed mostly neutral during this phase (hovering around 50-60), while the ATR (Average True Range) indicated a drop in volatility.

# 3. Fakeout City (That Dip Below $96,000)

Late in the session, I dipped below **$96,000**, aiming to shake out weak hands. This was my ""sneaky fox"" moment. I hunted:

* **Stop-losses of impatient longs** sitting just below $96,000.
* Bears piling in, thinking, *“Finally, the breakdown is here!”*

But you know me—I don’t make it that easy. After scooping up their liquidity, I **snapped back above $96,000** like a rubber band.

# 4. Late-Session Rebound ($96,400-$96,500)

As the session closed, I climbed back into the **$96,500 area**, brushing against the 50 EMA (again) but not breaking higher.

* **Why stop here?** I’m toying with expectations. It’s the perfect spot to leave traders undecided for tomorrow:
   * Bulls think, *“This might still run to $97,000!”*
   * Bears wonder, *“Should I hold shorts, or did I miss the exit?”*

# Takeaways from the Day

* **Liquidity Hunts:** My main game today was swiping stops from both sides—above $96,500 in the morning and below $96,000 in the afternoon.
* **Volume Profile:** Notice how volume spiked on the dips but thinned out during my climbs? That tells you the big money was more interested in punishing breakout traders than fueling a strong directional move.
* **EMA Resistance:** The 50 EMA acted like a magnet and a ceiling. I kept coming back to it but lacked the conviction to break through. This means tomorrow could get spicy if volume returns.

# What’s Next?

* **Key Levels to Watch:**
   * Resistance: $96,600-$96,800 (today’s highs and near the 50 EMA).
   * Support: $96,000 (psychological level and where liquidity was swept).
* **Setup Ideas:**
   * Bulls: Look for a confirmed breakout above $96,800 with volume to push toward $97,500.
   * Bears: Watch for another failed rally near $96,500-$96,800 to short back toward $95,500.

Today was a chess match. Tomorrow? I might flip the board. ",1,1733012071.0,u_VanceCoursewell,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Physically, I guess I’m average attractiveness, I take care of my health, I’m 5’8” and Asian by ethnicity (though not much else culturally). I do tend to have a preference for smart, quiet, thin women, which I guess narrows the pool somewhat.  

My two careers are in medicine and in my primary interest, and a niche and competitive area of fine arts (I’ll be broad about this one so as to not give too much personal detail), where I have found some success but, more importantly, which I find deeply fulfilling and where I derive a great deal of personal meaning. I love the balance of creativity but also the pursuit of truth that these fields offer- and of course my job as a physician leads to a financial security which I appreciate. Recently, I have been able to focus solely on my art for a while which has led me to meet tons of likeminded people, however I still haven’t established any connections who are interested beyond friendship.

I have a healthy social life with many friends from various backgrounds and age groups. My hobbies include swing and (more recently) salsa dance, where I meet tons of new people.

The kind of aimless wandering you do when the world feels too heavy, and all you want is to feel the pavement stretch out before you, no deadlines, no responsibilities. The clock on the dashboard read 3:47 PM when I left home, a time that felt neither early nor late. Just right for disappearing for a while.

The highway stretched for miles, the kind that lulls you into a trance if you’re not careful. I wasn’t in any hurry, though. The hum of the tires and the static of an old radio station filled the car. Every so often, I caught a faint whisper of a song, something familiar, but the static always devoured it before I could make it out. It didn’t matter. The journey was the point, not the destination.

At least, that’s what I kept telling myself.

I must have taken a wrong turn.

The sign was old, its paint peeling and letters faded. It didn’t say much—just the name of a town I didn’t recognize and an arrow pointing off the main road. Something about it caught my attention. Curiosity, maybe. Or boredom. I glanced at the gas gauge—still half full—and made the turn.

The road narrowed, the trees closing in on both sides like a tunnel. It was darker here, even though the sun was still high. My headlights flicked on automatically, catching glimpses of twisted branches overhead. It wasn’t unsettling, not exactly. Just… quiet.

The first sign of the town was the gas station, a relic from another era with a single pump out front. I slowed down, craning my neck to get a better look. A man sat in a plastic chair by the door, his face tilted up toward the sun. He didn’t move as I passed, didn’t seem to notice me at all.

Then came the houses.

They were small, modest things with chipped paint and sagging porches. Laundry flapped on lines in some of the yards, a dog barked somewhere in the distance. It could have been any town in the middle of nowhere. The kind of place you drive through on your way to somewhere else, its name forgotten the moment you pass the last house.

I slowed the car as I reached what looked like the main street. A diner with a faded neon sign sat on one corner; a hardware store with dusty windows on the other. There were people here, too, walking along the sidewalk or sitting on benches. They looked normal enough—mothers with strollers, old men with newspapers, a kid licking an ice cream cone.

I parked in front of the diner and killed the engine.

Something about the place made me want to stop. I couldn’t explain it. Maybe it was the stillness, the way the air seemed heavier here, as if the town was holding its breath. Or maybe it was just my own restless mind, looking for something—anything—to break the monotony of the day.

The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside.

The diner was like every other diner I’d ever been in: checkered floors, red vinyl booths, a counter with spinning stools. The smell of coffee and frying bacon hung in the air, warm and familiar. A waitress stood behind the counter, wiping it down with a rag. She looked up as I approached, her smile polite but distant.

“Afternoon,” she said. “Coffee?”

“Sure,” I replied, sliding onto one of the stools.

She poured a cup and set it in front of me, the steam curling upward in lazy spirals. I wrapped my hands around it, letting the warmth seep into my skin.

“Just passing through?” she asked, her tone casual.

“Yeah,” I said. “Took a wrong turn, I think. What’s the name of this town?”

She hesitated, just for a second, and then her smile returned.

“Welcome to Ridley,” she said.

Ridley. I’d never heard of it before.

“Nice place,” I offered, glancing out the window.

“It is,” she said, but there was something in her voice. Not pride, exactly. Something quieter. Sadder.

I sipped my coffee, letting my gaze wander. The diner wasn’t busy—just a couple in a corner booth and an older man by the window reading a newspaper. But it felt full somehow, like the silence itself was alive, pressing in on me from all sides.

“Anything else?” the waitress asked.

I shook my head. “Just the coffee.”

She nodded and moved away, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

I don’t know how long I sat there, staring into the dark surface of my drink. Long enough for the shadows outside to grow longer, stretching across the pavement like reaching fingers.

When I finally stepped back outside, the air felt different. Thicker. The sky had started to change, the blue fading into hues of orange and pink. I glanced at my watch—it was just after five. Time to head back, I decided.

But as I walked back to my car, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me.



The sun hung low in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows over the road as I pulled away from the diner. Ridley was small enough to miss if you blinked, but the silence of it clung to me, wrapping around my thoughts like fog. Something about the place felt… wrong.

I told myself it was just my imagination. Too much coffee, too little sleep. A quiet town in the middle of nowhere wasn’t unusual. But the hairs on the back of my neck refused to lie flat.

The road out of town looked the same as the one I came in on: narrow, tree-lined, and twisting. My headlights pierced the encroaching dusk, illuminating the cracks in the asphalt and the dense undergrowth on either side. I turned on the radio to break the stillness, but all I got was static, louder and harsher than before. I turned it off after a minute.

I kept driving.

The road stretched on, its curves familiar even though I was certain I hadn’t gone this way before. The trees pressed closer, their branches tangling overhead like skeletal hands. I glanced at the gas gauge—still enough to get me to the next town, wherever that was.

But when the trees broke and the road straightened, I saw it.

Ridley.

The same gas station, the same sagging houses, the same empty streets. My stomach tightened as I drove past the gas station, where the same man sat in the same plastic chair, his face still tilted toward the sky.

No. This wasn’t right.

I slowed the car and pulled over. Maybe I’d gotten turned around. I took a deep breath, checked my phone for directions. No signal. No GPS. Just a blank map mocking me.

I gripped the wheel and made a sharp U-turn.

This time, I watched every bend, every tree, every crack in the road. I marked the turns in my mind, making mental notes of every detail. The sky darkened as I drove, the sun dipping below the horizon and pulling the light with it.

But when the road opened up again, I was back.

Ridley.

My breath caught in my throat.

The gas station was still there, its single pump gleaming dully in the fading light. The man in the chair hadn’t moved.

I pulled over in front of the diner again, my pulse thudding in my ears.

This wasn’t possible.

The town seemed emptier now. The streets were still, the houses dark. Only a few lights glowed faintly in the windows. I stepped out of the car and called out, my voice echoing down the empty street.

“Hello? Is anyone here?”

No answer.

I walked to the diner and pushed open the door. The bell jingled above me, but the place was deserted. The coffee pot sat on the counter, half full, the liquid inside long since cooled.

“Hello?” I called again.

Nothing.

I turned and stepped back outside, scanning the street. A figure moved in the distance—a tall, thin man walking slowly toward me. Relief flooded through me, and I hurried to meet him.

“Excuse me!” I called. “I think I’m lost. Can you help me?”

He stopped in the middle of the street, his face obscured by the shadows.

“Lost,” he said, his voice deep and flat. “The only way forward is back. The only way out is in.”

“What?” I asked, frowning. “What does that mean? Look, I just need directions.”

He tilted his head, his movements unnervingly slow. “Two roads diverged in the woods,” he said. “You took the wrong one.”

“Okay,” I said, forcing a laugh. “Very poetic. But I just need to know how to leave.”

He didn’t respond. Instead, he stepped backward into the shadows and disappeared, as if he’d never been there at all.

I stared after him, my chest tightening.

Another figure appeared, this one a woman standing in the doorway of a house across the street. Her dress fluttered in the breeze, and her eyes glinted in the dim light.

“Hey!” I called, walking toward her.

She didn’t move, didn’t blink.

“Excuse me,” I said, stopping a few feet away. “Can you tell me how to get out of here?”

Her lips parted, and she spoke in a soft, lilting tone.

“The clock ticks backward; the shadows know your name. Choose your questions wisely, for answers are not the same.”

I took a step back, my stomach churning. “What are you talking about? What’s wrong with this place?”

But she turned and stepped into the house, the door creaking shut behind her.

I stood there in the empty street, the silence pressing down on me like a weight. The shadows seemed to lengthen, creeping closer, curling at the edges of my vision.

My breath came faster, and I turned back toward the car. I had to get out of here. I didn’t care how many times I ended up back in this cursed town—I was going to keep driving until I found a way out.

Or until something stopped me.



The first thing I noticed was the ticking.

I hadn’t paid much attention to it before. In a place like Ridley, with its old-fashioned charm and eerily quiet streets, ticking clocks seemed to fit right in. But now, as I sat in the car, trying to shake the words of that strange woman from my mind, the sound seemed to come from everywhere.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

It wasn’t coming from the dashboard clock—that was digital, frozen at 5:23 PM, the time I’d first noticed something was wrong. The ticking seemed to pulse from the town itself, a low, constant rhythm that wormed its way into my head.

I glanced at my wristwatch, seeking some reassurance. It read 5:18 PM.

I blinked. That couldn’t be right.

I checked again, tapping the glass face as if that would fix it. But the second hand was moving. Backward.

“No,” I whispered.

I yanked the watch off my wrist and threw it onto the passenger seat, my pulse quickening. My heart told me to leave, to peel out of this town and never look back. But the logical part of me, the part that had always needed answers, demanded an explanation.

I opened the car door, the ticking louder now as I stepped into the cool night air.

The shadows had grown longer, stretching across the ground like black rivers. The streetlamps flickered weakly, their light doing little to push back the encroaching dark. My eyes drifted toward the town square, where an old clock tower loomed against the twilight sky.

The clock face was faintly illuminated, its black hands crawling counterclockwise.

5:12 PM.

I stumbled backward, my breath catching in my throat. This wasn’t just a broken watch or a strange optical illusion. Time here was wrong.

I turned to get back into the car, but my shadow caught my eye.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. The weak glow of the streetlamp overhead flickered, and my shadow seemed to twitch, to ripple. I froze, staring at the dark shape stretching out from my feet.

It wasn’t moving with me.

I shifted my weight, lifting one foot, then the other. My shadow stayed perfectly still, as if it were rooted to the ground.

And then it moved.

It didn’t move like a shadow should, gliding across the pavement in response to light. It crawled, pulling itself forward, stretching and bending at impossible angles. It grew taller, thicker, the edges jagged and sharp.

I stumbled back, my hands shaking. “What the hell—”

Before I could finish, the shadow lunged.

It hit me like a wave, cold and suffocating, knocking me off my feet. I hit the ground hard, the air rushing out of my lungs. The shadow wrapped around me, pressing against my chest, my throat, my face. It felt like drowning, like being buried alive in ice-cold water.

I thrashed, clawing at it, but my hands passed through empty air. My own shadow shouldn’t have weight—it shouldn’t feel. But it did.

A voice echoed in my ears, low and distorted.

“The shadow remembers what you’ve forgotten.”

“What?” I gasped, choking on the words. “What does that mean?”

The pressure grew stronger, pinning me to the ground. I could feel my heartbeat slowing, the cold creeping into my limbs. My vision blurred, and for a moment, I thought I was going to die here, swallowed whole by my own shadow.

But then the streetlamp above me flickered again, this time brighter. The light cut through the darkness, and the shadow recoiled, shrinking back toward my feet. I scrambled to my knees, gasping for air, my chest heaving.

The shadow returned to its normal shape, lying flat against the ground as if nothing had happened.

I didn’t dare move. I stared at it, my hands trembling, waiting for it to attack again. But it didn’t. It stayed still, following the faint contours of my body like an obedient pet.

But I knew better now.

It wasn’t me. It wasn’t part of me.

And it was watching.


In its place was a silence so deep, it seemed to press against my ears, a heavy and unnatural stillness. I sat behind the wheel of the car, gripping it so tightly my knuckles turned white. The shadow beneath me hadn’t moved since the streetlamp had flickered, but I could still feel it.

I turned the key in the ignition. The engine groaned but didn’t catch.

“Come on,” I muttered, trying again.

Nothing.

The headlights flickered once and went out, plunging the street into darkness. I swore under my breath and opened the door. Maybe I could check the engine, figure out what was wrong. But as I stepped out, the oppressive quiet swallowed me whole.

It was night now—fully, completely. The moon hung low in the sky, its light pale and distant. The streetlamps had all gone dark, leaving the town bathed in long, creeping shadows.

I reached for the hood of the car, but my hand froze halfway.

They were moving.

The shadows.

They twisted and writhed across the pavement like living things, stretching unnaturally, their edges jagged and sharp. I stumbled back, my breath hitching in my throat.

“No,” I whispered, shaking my head.

The shadows didn’t care. They crept closer, slow and deliberate, circling around me like wolves.

“Stay back!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

They didn’t stop.

I turned and ran.

The town was unrecognizable now, the once-quiet streets a maze of darkness and shifting shapes. Every step I took seemed to echo, the sound swallowed almost immediately by the silence. I didn’t know where I was going—anywhere but here.

But the shadows followed.

They moved faster than they should have, their shapes morphing and splitting. One moment, they were flat and harmless, pooling at the edges of the buildings. The next, they rose like waves, towering over me, their jagged forms cutting through the moonlight.

And then they touched me.

It was like ice at first, a searing cold that burned my skin. I gasped, stumbling as one of the shadows slashed across my leg. The pain was real, sharp and blinding, and I could feel the blood soaking into my jeans.

I tried to run, but another shadow lashed out, wrapping around my arm. The pressure was unbearable, like a vice tightening around my bones. I screamed, clawing at the air, but there was nothing to grab onto.

“You don’t belong here,” a voice whispered, low and cruel, curling around my thoughts like smoke.

I spun around, searching for the source, but there was no one. Only the shadows, circling, watching, waiting.

“Let me go!” I shouted, my voice hoarse.

“Why should we?” another voice hissed, this one closer, more venomous.

The shadows pressed in, their forms coiling around my legs, my chest, my throat. They didn’t just hurt—they whispered.

I saw things. Flashes of memories that weren’t mine, images of faces I didn’t recognize, screams that weren’t my own. They poured into my mind like a flood, overwhelming me, drowning me.

“You’ve been here before,” one of the voices said, soft and mocking. “Do you remember?”

“No,” I whispered, clutching my head. “No, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Liar,” the voice spat.

The shadows squeezed tighter, and my vision blurred. I fell to my knees, the pavement rough and cold beneath me.

“Stop!” I begged.

The whispers grew louder, overlapping, becoming a cacophony of voices that clawed at my sanity. They spoke of things I couldn’t understand, riddles and half-truths that slipped through my grasp the moment I tried to hold onto them.

“You’ll never leave,” one voice said, sharp and final.

I couldn’t breathe. The shadows wrapped around my throat, cutting off my air, my vision dimming at the edges. The pain was unbearable, and for a moment, I thought this was it—that the town had won.

But then the shadows stopped.

They didn’t retreat, didn’t fade away. They froze, their jagged forms trembling, as if caught in a moment of indecision.

A faint light flickered in the distance, weak but steady.

The shadows hissed, recoiling from the light, their forms unraveling like smoke in the wind. I gasped for air, clutching my chest as I stumbled to my feet.

The light grew stronger, and I realized it was coming from the clock tower. Its face glowed faintly, the hands still spinning backward.

The shadows retreated, melting into the cracks of the pavement, their whispers fading into the night.

I stood there, trembling, staring at the clock tower. The pain in my leg and arm was real, the blood warm and sticky against my skin. But the shadows were gone.

For now.

And I knew one thing for certain:

Ridley wasn’t going to let me go.


The town felt quieter now, as if holding its breath. The oppressive darkness had receded, but the tension in the air remained, prickling at my skin. My injuries ached, but I forced myself to move, driven by the riddle still echoing in my mind.

“The clock ticks backward; the shadows know your name. Choose your questions wisely, for answers are not the same.”

It wasn’t the first riddle I’d been given, but this one stuck with me, as if it held the key to understanding everything. I hadn’t seen another living soul since the shadows attacked me. My only lead was the faint glow of the clock tower in the distance.

I limped toward it, each step a struggle. The town seemed to shift as I walked, the streets bending and twisting in ways that didn’t make sense. I passed houses with windows that stared like hollow eyes and alleyways that seemed to stretch endlessly into black voids.

Eventually, I saw her.

The woman from before—the one who spoke in riddles—stood in the middle of the street, her pale dress fluttering in the faint breeze. Her face was obscured by the shadow of her wide-brimmed hat, but I could feel her gaze fixed on me.

“You’re still here,” she said, her voice soft but cold.

“I need answers,” I said, my voice hoarse.

Her lips curved into a faint smile. “Answers are earned, not given. Solve the riddle.”

“I don’t understand it,” I admitted. “The clock ticks backward… the shadows know my name… What does it mean?”

She tilted her head, her smile widening. “You already know the answer. You’ve always known.”

Frustration boiled over, and I stepped closer. “Why won’t anyone just tell me? What is this place? Why can’t I leave?”

Her expression darkened, and she raised a hand, pointing toward the clock tower. “The answers you seek are there. But be warned: truth is a blade that cuts both ways.”

I hesitated, the weight of her words settling on my shoulders. Then I turned and walked toward the tower.

The massive doors of the clock tower loomed before me, weathered wood cracked and splintered. I pushed them open, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was cold and stale, the faint ticking of the clock echoing through the cavernous space.

The walls were lined with old photographs, newspaper clippings, and handwritten notes. The floor was littered with shards of broken glass and pieces of machinery.

At the center of the room stood a spiral staircase, winding upward into darkness.

I moved closer, my breath catching as I scanned the clippings on the walls. One headline stood out: “Local Woman Found Dead: Husband Suspected.”

The name beneath the headline was mine.

“No…” I whispered, stumbling back.

More articles followed, each one detailing my life—or what felt like someone else’s. My wife, Sarah. Our arguments. The night she disappeared. The mounting evidence against me.

Another headline caught my eye: “Fugitive Dies in Crash While Fleeing Country.”

The memory hit me like a sledgehammer.

I’d done it. I’d killed her in a fit of rage. I remembered the blood, the panic, the desperate decision to run. The rain-soaked roads. The headlights of an oncoming truck. The crash.

I hadn’t escaped.

I had died.

And this… this wasn’t a town.

This was Hell.

The staircase called to me, and I climbed, each step heavy with the weight of my realization. At the top, I found the clock mechanism, its gears grinding relentlessly as the hands moved backward.

In the center of the room stood a mirror, its frame ornate and covered in strange symbols. I stepped closer, and the reflection stopped me cold.

It wasn’t just me staring back. My shadow was there, too, standing behind me, darker and sharper than ever. Its edges writhed like smoke, its eyes glowing faintly.

“You know the truth now,” it whispered, its voice a cold echo in my mind.

I swallowed hard. “I don’t belong here. I don’t deserve this.”

The shadow laughed, a low, hollow sound. “You deserve worse. But eternity has its own rules.”

I clenched my fists. “How do I get out?”

“You don’t,” it said simply. “But you can try.”

The gears of the clock ground to a halt, and the room shook violently. The hands on the clock spun faster and faster, blurring as they reversed through time. The shadow reached for me, its touch ice-cold, and the room dissolved into darkness.

It was supposed to be a simple drive.

The kind of aimless wandering you do when the world feels too heavy, and all you want is to feel the pavement stretch out before you, no deadlines, no responsibilities.

This Thanksgiving, and I was stuck covering a brutal double shift—from 3 PM to 7 AM—because a coworker called out. Running on nothing but coffee and determination, I was just trying to get through the night. Then Aubrey walked in and turned a long day into an unforgettable disaster.

Her companion, Mr. Jun, reported a problem with the heating in their room. I offered to send someone right away, but he asked us to wait until they weren’t in the room. No problem, I thought. Later, when our engineer went to fix it, they found a cigar hidden in the trash—a clear violation of our non-smoking policy. The standard cleaning fee was applied.

That’s when the nightmare started. Aubrey began calling the front desk. And I don’t mean once or twice. She relentlessly called, screaming insults at me, calling me a ""f**ing rtard,"" and—get this—burping loudly into the phone before hanging up.

I stayed calm, professional even, as I explained (repeatedly) that the heater had been fixed and that we didn’t have staff available after 8:30 PM due to the holiday. But that didn’t stop her. Each call was angrier, louder, and more degrading.

The kicker? I was completely alone. No security. No backup. Just me, holding down the fort on one of the busiest holidays of the year. Her relentless harassment, insults, and refusal to follow basic policies weren’t just exhausting—they were dehumanizing.

Here’s the part that really gets me: Aubrey is a lifestyle influencer. She markets herself as this image of elegance, inspiration, and class. But in reality? She’s the person who bullies service workers, ignores rules, and treats people like garbage.

And to top it all off, what did the hotel do the next day? They refunded her entire stay, removed the smoking fee, and even gave her a new room. The cherry on top? When we went to check the room she stayed in on her last night, we found tobacco everywhere. The smell of cigars still lingered, and there were ashes in plain sight. Management claimed none of it was ""sufficient proof.""

After that, I couldn’t take it anymore. I handed in my notice. I’m currently job hunting, hoping to find a place where management actually has your back and guests like Aubrey aren’t rewarded for their behavior.

If you’re following @aubreyllia and think she’s an inspiration, you might want to reconsider. Her public persona is a far cry from how she treated someone just trying to do their job on Thanksgiving.

Have you ever dealt with someone like this? Let me know, because this experience still has me reeling.",24,1733011322.0,hotels,0,0.96,False
1h3q2ot,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3q2ot,Find yourself a friend who will split a DAK order,"Had a home cupping today of 6 different DAK coffees! Rumba, Orange County, Kumquat Squat, Magnolia, Lime Ball, Sweet Dreams. All were tasty and distinct, but I have to say Sweet Dreams was a standout just for how damn weird it is. 100% like a rosemary focaccia. Lime Ball has a similar Eucalyptus note to another Los Nogales coffee I’ve tried (decaf from Blendin) but also with a baking spice, pastry quality. Cheesecake and specloos notes on the packaging are surprisingly accurate. Magnolia is the subtlest, most floral of the bunch, also with some nutty qualities. Kumquat Squat is just a classic, delicious natural Ethiopian, and it reminds me a bit of Blueberry Boom. So fruity it’s almost perfumey. Rumba was extremely complex and a little confusing, but with some delicious dried fruit and tropical notes. And finally Orange County, which was right over home plate for me. Juicy, honey, balanced. 

10/10 recommend going in on a big order with a friend to split bags and save on shipping. Excited to dial them in - let me know if you have any experience brewing these coffees and any recipes/advice! ",30,1733011265.0,pourover,3,0.89,False

My complaints about it really is as a thermoblock it is hit or miss with steam and it’s just generally not a dry steam. 

I’m mostly drinking shots of medium and dark roast and the occasional milk drinks (usually when I am dialing in a new bean, or for my wife. 

So I’m considering a DF83 v2 as a grinder or a Bezzera Aria as a machine, at the moment I don’t think I have the budget to do both. I feel like I can get by with my Vario with the Aria, but I’m also wondering what life is like with a more substantial grinder if I wanted to branch out into more light roasts or gain greater complexity. 

Curious to hear what ya’ll think. If I was to get the Aria, the Vario would be relegated to my filter coffee grinder so I can retire my trusty old Capresso Infinity which I’ve had for I think 13 years. ",1,1733010796.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I've been friends with the same group of girls since high school but we've all known each other since we were much younger. About 10 years ago, one friend (let's call her A) met her now husband and quickly got pregnant with their first child. Fast forward a few years and she has another child with the same husband. 

Most of the other girls in the group are all mothers as well (this is relevant for later). A couple of years ago, we found out that her husband had been tried and pled guilty of possessing indecent images of children and contacting a minor for indecent images for money (as well as some other things). The minor that was contacted was an undercover police officer which is how he was caught. 

A has decided to stand by him and some of her friends and his family also stand by him but our friend group is divided. A believes it is made up and he didn't do it despite many arguments with some of the rest of the group. Most of us know he's guilty and don't want our children around him but the majority of the group still include her in invites to events and plan coffee dates with her. 

A wants everything to go back to normal in the friend group but I am the only one that doesn't really want anything to do with her and it's creating a divide. When we found out what he had done, A then told us she had known for almost 2 years and hadn't told us to ""protect her family"". I can't get over such a big lie but all my friends want to be there for A. 

I can't help thinking that this is her choice. She lied to us for almost 2 years, hosted parties at her house with children invited and takes no responsibility or accountability in her decision making. 

I don't want a friend like that. Am I being crazy and TA? Because I'm being made to feel like one. ",2,1733010623.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

The last time we spoke was spring of 2023 and we argued over the fact that my mom has donated to her dozens of VERY nice furniture pieces over the years and she’s always trashed them or put them in non-climate controlled storage to rot and I wanted to get one piece of furniture back (a coffee table) since my mom was giving me the rest of the set. She wasn’t using it but oh as soon as I asked she swore that it would be her only table to eat off of and what will she do (despite my mom having donated several other tables, including a nice dining table). Anyway, I never got the table. Also, at the time, our grandfather had recently passed away and she wasn’t using given the car (a brand new SUV) because she was having financial trouble and this would allow her to have a paid off vehicle and no more car payments. But no, she wanted to keep her jeep too because of the jeep culture and she wanted both cars. That really rubbed her dad and my mom the wrong way because the reason she was picked to have the car was to help her out financially but she wanted the nice car and the fun car…it just felt like a slap in the face to everyone trying to help her. We haven’t spoken since then. My mom has and has kept in touch and apparently my mom has forgiven her (I don’t know what happened with the cars—a year and a half ago right after all this my fiancé and I sold our house and moved states for his job so that process took over all my focus).

So, fast forward to now, I have not seen or heard from her in all that time and out of the blue she texts me just a picture of the ultrasound and the words “Coming soon! May 2025”. That’s it. I haven’t opened the text yet because I don’t want to send a read receipt. Idk, I’m just having a hard time knowing what to say. On the one hand, I still love her, she’s my cousin and she’s wanted kids forever and I am happy that she is getting something that she wants. But on the other hand, it bothers me that society tells us we have to set aside the fact that we havent spoken in all that time for a reason and just because kids oh all is forgiven and no apology is needed? Idk. It just bothers me. 

Also, she is not a very responsible person and the only man she’s been with to any serious degree was her late husband who was an absolute psycho. Now, she’s been seeing this guy for about a year but it’s apparently very casual and I don’t know y’all, that just feels very weird because kids are not a casual thing. 

Idk. I need some perspective here and not from the majority of society that whenever it involves kids lose all sensibility and gush. Should I just suck it up and say Congrats? Or do I bring up the fact that we haven’t spoken in all that time because of her actions and we’ve never cleared the air? 

Also, last thing, I’m one of those CF people that really really dislikes kids and everything to do with kids. I think kids deserve a good and safe home, but I just want absolutely no part of it whatsoever. Just wanted to mention that because that also might be driving why this is bothering me so much more than if she just out of the blue announced she was getting married or graduating college or something along those lines.

This Thanksgiving, and I was stuck covering a brutal double shift—from 3 PM to 7 AM—because a coworker called out. Running on nothing but coffee and determination, I was just trying to get through the night. Then Aubrey walked in and turned a long day into an unforgettable disaster.

Her companion, reported a problem with the heating in their room. I offered to send someone right away, but he asked us to wait until they weren’t in the room. No problem, I thought. Later, when our engineer went to fix it, they found a cigar hidden in the trash—a clear violation of our non-smoking policy. The standard cleaning fee was applied.

That’s when the nightmare started. Aubrey began calling the front desk. And I don’t mean once or twice. She relentlessly called, screaming insults at me, calling me a ""f**ing rtard,"" and—get this—burping loudly into the phone before hanging up.

I stayed calm, professional even, as I explained (repeatedly) that the heater had been fixed and that we didn’t have staff available after 8:30 PM due to the holiday. But that didn’t stop her. Each call was angrier, louder, and more degrading.

The kicker? I was completely alone. No security. No backup. Just me, holding down the fort on one of the busiest holidays of the year. Her relentless harassment, insults, and refusal to follow basic policies weren’t just exhausting—they were dehumanizing.

Here’s the part that really gets me: Aubrey is a lifestyle influencer. She markets herself as this image of elegance, inspiration, and class. But in reality? She’s the person who bullies service workers, ignores rules, and treats people like garbage.

And to top it all off, what did the hotel do the next day? They refunded her entire stay, removed the smoking fee, and even gave her a new room. The cherry on top? When we went to check the room she stayed in on her last night, we found tobacco everywhere. The smell of cigars still lingered, and there were ashes in plain sight. Management claimed none of it was ""sufficient proof.""

After that, I couldn’t take it anymore. I handed in my notice. I’m currently job hunting, hoping to find a place where management actually has your back and guests like Aubrey aren’t rewarded for their behavior.

If you’re following Aubrey and think she’s an inspiration, you might want to reconsider. Her public persona is a far cry from how she treated someone just trying to do their job on Thanksgiving.

I'm hoping to get insights on what espresso machine to buy as the options online can be quite confusing 🥲


Budget: 10-80k

Newbie like I use a regular coffee maker you can buy at sm appliance or a french press. And I just order beans online from shopee (usually robusta or arabica).

My everyday coffee is black coffee due to health reasons (e.g sugar) and occasional coffee shop depending on ano malapit sa gala (e.g SB, Zus, etc). Looking to upgrade my day-to-day coffee.

Im eyeing to buy an espresso machine. I searched the famous ones like Gemilai or Delonghi at ung gusto ko ung tipong automatic or semi-automatic  ones w/ grinder.  But flexible naman separate grinder if ever.


But I'm also seeing similar brands like Hi-brew, Condura or Cuppa that seem to offer similar functionality (e.g grinder, one-click buttons for espresso shots or long)


Hi-brew seems to have a lot of good choices to choose from as well.

I assured him that I was never at this hotel but would meet him at the hotel.  Upon my arrival, the manager seemed somewhat shocked when I introduced myself. I met with the Trooper and Manager in a separate room and demanded to know the basis for the allegations.  The manager showed me video footage from 2:15am the prior night in which my wife and another man, obviously intoxicated, entered the hotel’s dinning room, rummaged through the cabinets and removed the coffee maker. Although I was shocked and furious, I allowed the hotel to charge my card to resolve the matter. I returned home and went through the Marriott Rewards account linked to that credit card.  There were dozens of stays at that hotel over the last year.  That evening, I embellished the story and told my wife I had been arrested for theft at the hotel and had to return the coffee maker.

What are some other things you guys recommend for her to easily switch to that don’t vary much from the original? Any product recommendations? I don’t consume a ton of vegan alternatives other than some vegan butter in baking, almond milk, just egg (which is not close to real eggs at all and therefore not a good transition product imo). A little bit ago I tried to have her try vegan butter but we left it in the counter cause that’s where we keep our butter and it was a weird consistency once it came to room temperature. I’m thinking substitutions for mainly the byproducts cause she’s already started to detransition from the usual meat she would eat. The only problem for her is gonna be cheese, I told her to slowly eat less cause to my knowledge there’s no comparable alternative that is comparable (unless y’all have some?). Anyways, maybe things like cream cheese, yogurt, sour cream, butter (that can sit on the counter), eggs in salad, etc. I’ve tried some of these substitutions but I’m afraid my taste buds could be biased since I haven’t had the real thing in so long.

1h3pkgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1h3pkgd/my_coworkers_underestimate_me/,My coworkers underestimate me,"Just a rant, but I still want advice because this has been pissing me off for quite a while.

I switched cafés from a chain to a local craft shop about two months ago, going from mostly working with women to only working with men. Aside from the fact that I was previously working for a chain I have been present in my local specialty scene, going to open cuppings, coffee fests/events, competing, and generally just being as much as a coffee nerd as everyone else I'm working with, if not more so.

My problem is that two of my coworkers, with one of them working in the industry shorter than me, treat me like a fucking idiot. I think it's because I'm a woman. Every single shift I have with these two people I'm severely micromanaged, told to do things (as I am doing them?) and get step by step instructions for things I am totally clear on how to do, or even just a ""use X grind size for that"" (yes, I work here too, I know the grind size for that.) The reason I think it's because I'm a woman is that we have another employee with less experience than I do who never has this happen to him. He just does what he wants, the way he wants to do it, but no one ever comments on it, but as soon as I even come close to the grinder someone wants to give me instructions on how to dial in as if I haven't done this shit for years? 

Not to mention the amount of random comments I get on my appearance from customers, that no one defends me from except for my (lovely, amazing) boss. 

I mostly only work with these people on weekends but I'm afraid of bringing it up with my boss (the owner) because these people are amazing baristas, also I know that if I say something they WILL know it was me, and I don't want a sour relationship in the shop. I feel like bringing it up with them wouldn't really be an option either because both of them give me the ""haha yeah, I'm a feminist"" vibes. Idk what to do here",3,1733009797.0,barista,4,1.0,False

Things like paying for your coffee or a snack so usually under 5$. I’m in the financial position of not having a super tight budget and again, I just like doing stuff like that. 

With people I’ve known for longer, I can usually just say ""no no you’re good"" when they try to repay me but with people I’ve only known a short period of time, it sometimes takes a bit. 

Recently a girl from uni who I have barely spoken to needed some change for the printer. I gave her a few bucks and she told me she would give it back the next day. Told her it’s fine but she still asked if I was sure. 

I do get where they’re coming from and I do appreciate their willingness to repay me, but a gift is only a gift if you expect nothing in return. Of course some people might’ve had bad experiences so I’m not mad at them or anything. 

I’m also aware that some people are in a different financial situation and feel bad when someone pays for them. I’m a little conflicted in such cases cause I would like to treat them more often but I also see that that might be inappropriate or could be seen as some kind of power play.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Tunja, Dossur influencer***

*Date [standardized human time] August 23rd 2136*

*Why am I doing this? He literally just said there were predators in this movie, large predators!* And yet, here I was, holding onto him like he was a plushie… *A soft…warm…cuddly predator plushie I can call my own~.* I took another deep breath, calming my nerves. *It’s just a movie, nothing in this is real, it can’t hurt you and you have Dillon here to answer any questions you may have. Just watching a movie with a friend. The Gang and I do this all of the time when we hang out. *~~although most of those movies are romance drama’s~~ Those can be scary, sometimes!*

“And here…we…go!” Dillon’s voice stirred me from my inner monologue, causing my eye to focus on the headspace above the bed. He turned the movie on, only to stop it as the view of a purple night sky studded with clouds came on the screen. “Ah, wait. Knew I was forgetting something! I…erm, Tunja? Can you push that button of the moon next to your chest on the bed frame?”

“Huh? Oh yeah. Just-...” I moved one paw from his body to reach down where my other eye was looking. When I finally found it, the lights in the room dimmed low, startling me a little before I could push my logical side back down to the depths. *None of that right now, thank you.*

As I went to hold him again, he resumed the movie. The movie panned down from the beautiful night sky to a sprawling cityscape, soft music slowly rising in volume. A sudden explosion made me jump, thinking this movie was starting with a space battle, but the bursts were accented with strangely vibrant colors. “Wh-what are those!” I gasped, squeezing him a little. Not out of fear, but wonder.

“Those are fireworks!” He squeaked from my grip. “Decorative explosions Humanity uses to celebrate certain events. Sulfer, magnesium, phosphorus and the like are used for the colors!”

 I could feel them sparkling in my eye as the music reached a creshendo, uplifting my heart as what appeared to be an elegant stone building rushed into view, these so-called ‘fireworks’ blasting around it without damaging it at all. My mouth opened a little. *Leave it to the Humans to make something so destructive, yet so beautiful. If anyone set those off over Venlil Prime, there would be stampedes, for sure.*

A whistling firework rushed in an arch over the building before strange human shapes came into view which my visual translator read as WALT DISNEY PICTURES before everything faded out. I knew a company name when I saw one.

The screen darkened before panning down to what I assumed was a warehouse, but nothing that would be built on Venlil Prime. I had lived there for most of my life, so I had forgotten that the gently sloping buildings that were normal there were mainly specific to the skittish Venlil.

A lamp flicked on, showing the scruffy face of a human. His features were a bit like Dillon’s, only a bit chubbier. He was talking to someone named Darwin, expressing the importance of them meeting in secrecy. There was another voice, whom I assumed to be Darwin, the screen panned over to an empty chair at the other end of the table the Human was sitting at.

My eyes widened as a brown and white Dossur…no, not a Dossur. No long bushy tail and the ears were all wrong. But everything else was very similar. My translator depicted the creature as male and apparently, whatever operation him and the Human were a part of was being shut down by some sort of Government. They had to do something in order to prove their worth so as not to be shut down.

Pulling out a briefcase of…*odd…that’s a material I’ve never seen before.* I opened my mouth to ask Dillon what it was, only for the Human to open it and a myriad of special effects made him look like he was typing in midair. I instead asked. “When did you say this movie was made?”

“About a century and a half ago. If I remember right.”

“Huh. Not bad in the graphics department. It’s nice to finally see proof of effort in Human media.” I teased before going quiet again. 

A villain and his corporation were apparently creating data chips for military use. Clusterstorm, is what he called it. *Okay, so we have technology being used for war. Classic predator move, said every Exterminator.* 

Darwin is told that it’ll be his job to infiltrate this corporation to gather information from the villains computer. Darwin was confident in his and the Human’s ability to get the job done. That’s when he made a pun on his height that actually made me chitter. Something about seeing the upside, him being so small. I would need to remember that line the next time someone commented on my height.

The screen whipped to the title and I couldn’t help but enjoy myself. So far, so good. Classic espionage, kind of reminded me of an episode of the Exterminators. As the screen showed a night time view of a building, there were tons of humans entering, their chatter innocuous as it panned to what I assumed was a guard and…and…

A deep growl made me tense up as the screen showed a quadrupedal predator, dark and sleek. I could just barely make out its muscles. And they were big. Well, they only came up to the human's thigh, but still far bigger than Darwin would be. It seemed as though Dillon could tell what I was thinking.

“Er…yeah. That's a dog. One of the many breeds, I mean. Often in human society dogs will have jobs. Some have caretaker jobs, which are known as service dogs. Some will herd cattle, without hurting them of course. These dogs in the movie are known as guard dogs. They help the humans keep undesirable people from entering the property.”

Not wanting to focus on the implications of the multiple uses of just one domesticated species, I decided to not say anything but continue watching, stroking Dillon’s belly absentmindedly. *Domesticated…predators. Such a bizarre concept. Insane, if I wasn’t seeing it myself.*

But Darwin was too smart for all of that, of course he was. Jumping down from a tree he was hiding in, a feat even I would hesitate to do. *Not that I couldn’t.* He calls for someone named Speckles, who turns out to be underground and…A Drezjin without wings…or…ears? So, a digging creature I surmised. Given his claws and nose with all his feelers. Just a strange concept. I wondered if, out of the near 300 Alien species, if there were people who enjoyed dirt that much? The spiky Gojidi were kind of like that, especially in more rural areas with their houses more resembling bunkers. But other than that…

My thoughts were interrupted as Darwin Zoomed into Mr. Evil Human guy with a pair of pretty cool goggles. Oh yeah, this was definitely the Bad place. Speckles names a few others on the team. Juarez, a Black (Dossur?) with white patterns running down her body from her face and a nice patch of raised fur on her head and back. *Huh, I wonder if I could pull something like that off.* The other one was named Blaster. I couldn't readily see what color his fur was due to the diving suit They were both wearing, but he was the scruffier of the two and they were both…Underwater? Oh wow, definitely wouldn’t see a scene like that in the Exterminators. Most people don't like going near larger bodies of water…although I don't exactly know why, come to think of it. 

Speckles called out Darwin on his being nervous, Darwin admitting it to be his first mission. I could empathize with that. I was scared during my first live gaming stream. But it turned out alright. Perhaps this would be the same way, even with the…Dobermans…as Speckles called them.

That’s when the screen showed another creature…Okay, THAT had to be a-!

“Before you say anything, that is a Squirrel.” Dillon’s voice perked up from below. “It’s a non-sapient creature that…well…I think of when I look at you. But!” He said as I started to squeeze him. “Th-There is no comparison. You are far better and…prettier than what we have.” He hesitated before saying that word again when talking about me. But it wasn’t in a teasing tone. He really did think I was pretty.

I chuffed, easing my grip with a certain satisfaction as the movie continued. Blaster came out of the water and I could finally see the color of his fur…Huh, it was very much like that of Juarez. I wonder, could they be related? Oh…nevermind. Because as soon as Juarez stepped out and shook herself off, even I could see that Blaster was attracted to her. “Oh yeah, Juarez. You go, girl.” I whispered, earning a soft chuckle from Dillon.

“I thought you would like her.”

I made no effort to deny what he said. Darwin managed to infiltrate the party and…Is that a bug? They put spy gear on a bug!? I really couldn’t see the use of doing that, I wouldn’t trust a stupid Laisy with something like this. 

Darwin popped out of a…pelt hanging on the wall? Only to look up and-. AND…Humans, this movie was made by Humans, why wouldn’t Humans make clothing out of animals? But to leave the head on the clothing! I felt Darwin was handling the situation a lot better than I would…Than I was? Now that I thought of it, I WAS handling this better than I would have originally given myself credit for…Huh. It was almost as if…

I looked down at Dillon again, the warmth I could still feel radiating from him into me providing a sort of comfort. He was here for me, he wanted to share this with me and…was he worried how I would think of him because of it? I had to keep in mind that Humans could make beautiful things, their food was a testament to that. But I know full well that our society isn’t perfect, no one's is. Taking a deep breath, I tried to keep this in mind as I kept watching, realizing that Darwin had welded his way through a steel wall.

Mr. Bad Human was giving a speech to a crowd of Humans. Something about successful electronics. It sounded like something the Fissans or Nevoks would be excited about. Corporate jargen I never pretend to understand. But the fly was back! Mooch, Speckles said…Her?... Name was. Speckles called Mooch ‘Honey’, which Dillon confirmed was a term of indeerment when I asked. Mooch had taken a break to eat and was a bug after my own heart. Never a bad time to catch a bite to eat, especially when sweets were involved.

As Mooch goes back to work, Blaster and Juarez are shown rappelling up the outside of the building, Juarez getting one over on Blaster in the process. Oh yeah, she knows how he feels. Keep him guessing, girl.

Darwin had infiltrated a special room through the ventilation system. I’m actually getting into this whole Dossur spy game they are playing. Why couldn’t we Dossur actually do stuff like this? *~~Because it’s predatory?~~* *Heh, yeah. Must be.* 

Badman is still harping on his fancy appliances. *Oh, I put chips in all your portable Strayu forges.* Or something like that. Mooch is seen filming all of this as Bad guy McGee is about to activate all chips around the world. Something about Communication and being connected…Kind of sounds familiar, actually.

While Evil guy is Talking about coff-eeh being added to shopping lists, the movie cuts to Darwin typing on a computer and I couldn’t help but flick my tail joyfully at his complaining how big the Keyboard was. I definitely felt his pain. Federation tech rarely deviated for extreme sizes in mind.

Blaster and Juarez are doing their spy thing on the roof with him still making moves on her, only…*GASP*...she admits to have a thing for Darwin. Drama! Not that I actually go for that sort of gossip. But, nice to know she understands her worth.

Darwin is doing his hacky thing into the Clusterstorm tech on the small computer. Only for…Oh…wow, Not just global domination, but extinction. Kind of Ironic with what the Federation thought happened to the Humans in the past. For Humans to have the same concept that had originally horrified us and used it for entertainment…sounds familiar actually.

Mooch flies to distract the Bad Human by…going up his nose and back out! I snorted, not able to help myself as I could only imagine what that felt like. For such a little bug to cause so much annoyance. I imagined what having a friend like Mooch would be like. Just to send them out and terrorize all of those jerks online. What would I even call Mooch? A friend? A creature I kept around for companionship? I’m sure there was a word for that somewhere.

Darwin finally gets through the encryption that had been keeping him out while trying to download the files, only for him to thank Speckles for helping. That’s when Speckles called himself a Mole. It was nice to learn about new species but…Holy crap, what is that!? Something long and pink is dangling down and…*Oh Protector…I’m gonna-!*

My body lurched as I almost puked up all over Dillon. I tried to get up, to get away so as not to make a mess, but he had turned over in my arms and started to rub my chest and belly. “T-Tunja! It’s okay! That was…that’s just what creatures like Speckles eat! Bugs, insects and whatever is in the ground, he-.”

“He ate it! Like…it was still alive and, oh Protector, I-” To my surprise, the urge to puke subsided, causing me to blink as I looked down at Dillon, now rubbing my belly with both paws. I could feel my ears starting to bloom at the realization. “Erm…That…Thank you, I mean. I-I’m okay now. Speckles eats things in the ground, I got it.
I gave him my best Human smile, making him chuckle before turning back around.

I tried to get my waging inner thoughts back under control. Although, I would have to remember that for the future. He really was good at comforting me. I nuzzled the top of his head as the movie continued.

While Darwin was still hacking the signal, Mr. Bad guy, *I really did NOT learn what his name was.* , came in, forcing him to flee, but not completely. I actually felt tingly with excitement at such a scene, only for the heat to be turned up literally, forcing Darwin to run to the chimney hole. I made a little squeak of worry, holding Dillon tighter as that was any PD persons worst nightmare.

He made it!, Juarez and Blaster helping him up. Speckles tried to leave as well, but that brahking Dog was blocking the way with what I can shamelessly say made me jump with a snapping mawshot. Blaster swoops in with a…fabric of some kind? It let him float down to the Dog before, stomping on its head! *Ha!* Only to get himself stuck in a tree!

Juarez dives in right before Blaster is done for, throwing something that ties it’s mouth shut, sending it whimpering away! Serves it right. They were gonna get away! But even if they were running, an all too familiar van stops in front of them and…no way… “D-Dillon?” My visual Translator Read the word Exterminator on the side of the vehicle above a picture of a rodent on its back. That’s when a Human stepped out in a full body suit and…sprayed smoke!

I closed my eyes, pulling Dillon up to bury the side of my face in the back of his neck. I prepared for the worse. For the movie to end so quickly! A few seconds pass when I hear the voice of Juarez coughing about too much smoke to someone named Ben. I slowly looked from behind Dillon to see it was the Human from before! The good Human with the face fur. Ben~.

“You okay, Tunja?” Dillon asked in a worried voice.

“Y-Yeah…just…that was a little too close to home.”

“But they are okay! See? All part of the plan.”

“Yeah…” I continued watching, trying not to think about real life on Prime too much as Darwin and the gang made it back to the Warehouse from the beginning. Speckles was transferring the files and…Oh! A new Human. Kind of like Sara from first contact, was helping them, now. Their body was more slender so must be Female.

I lowered Dillon back to my belly. I was growing to love this position. And holding him was helping me keep calm when I would originally be running away from a movie like this. 

After finding out Speckles had poor eyesight when trying to compliment Ben through a blurry haze without his goggles, the movie cuts to a set of Dossur Studio apartments. Blaster is playing a Dance game that I would have to ask Dillon about later but Juarez is the star of this scene. Darwin shoots his shot, only to learn she’s using him to make Blaster more interested. *Huh…I wonder if that works on Humans. ~~Any Humans in mind?~~ Annnnd, back to the movie!*

Three Government types visit the Warehouse, senior one named Killian…because of course he was. Was I actually getting into this movie? I was less offended and becoming invested with Dillon in my arms. I felt…safer. I wonder what else I could do with him around.

Ben guides them through the warehouse, showing stealth insect and Doss-…Ah, Brahk it…Dossur intelligence with their quick reflexes. Everything was going well until Ben mentions the mission. Killian doesn’t like that. Speckles tries to fix the situation by showing the Clusterstorm files only to pull up…A Coffee machine? Coffee. Huh…I’ll have to ask Dillon about that, later. That looked like a complicated machine.

Killian is understandably upset at Darwin almost jeopardizing their two year mission, only for him to download the wrong file. Killian takes Ben outside to tell him they are shutting the program down. Although something Killian said bugged me.

“Dillon, what did he mean by saying ‘use them as guinea pigs’.” I felt his body stiffen at this, knowing that I just stumbled onto something else the UN probably didn’t want me to know about.

“We…used to use animals in, beauty and pharmaceutical testing.” Now it was my turn to tense up. 

“You did tests on animals?” My instincts were telling me to get away from him, my paws weakening in their hold on them, but I tried to push through them. There had to be a reason.”

“Y-You have to understand, Tunja. We didn’t have the technology we have today. We couldn’t use cell cultures for vaccines or medicines. And…as with what Ben said about how similar Guinea pigs are, or Rodents in general, to us…Without their unfortunate contributions, humanity as a whole would not have had the advancements in medicine we have. It’s not a past that we are proud of. There is plenty in our past, as a civilization, that we are ashamed of, but we are trying to be better.

He looked down at my paws, making me realize that only the tips of my claws were touching him. Even now, I could feel the absence of the comfort of what I usually felt while embracing him. *~~He’s not a monster~~ I know..! I know.*

The movie was still playing. Something about stealth Hamsters while they are escaping, but I still looked down at the dejected Human on top of me. I reapplied my grip on his body, turning him on his side. I could hear him start to protest, but I placed a paw on the side of head, pressing the other side to my chest, my other paw supporting him so he could curl up. 

A fresh wave of warmth radiated from him, feeling it welling up deep down inside me as well. This moment was embarrassing to say the least, but I could feel an affection towards my Human. As if we were both to blame for the situation.

“Tunja? There’s something I want to talk to you about after this movie. Okay?” He looked up at me, hope in his eyes.

“Yeah, okay.” My voice was surprisingly soft. Were…were we having a moment, just now? Everything felt so light and comforting. I’m certain I wasn’t overdosing on Human contact, but this feeling. It was difficult to stay angry or sad. Just calm contentment…*I could get used to this. ~~You know how to make that happen~~* I pushed that thought down, feeling the tips of my ears blooming as I looked back to the movie.

Darwin and the gang had escaped to a…Pet…Shop…*Sigh* in the back of a large truck. Being carried into the building in a c-cage, that made me shiver a little, they were placed in an even larger cage with…what I can lightly say was a rag tag bunch of other Dossur like animals. It’s surprising just how many companion animals Humans depend on. 

I looked down at Dillon, still curled up as I’m sure he was trying to covertly sneak a few rubs of my belly and chest fur with his cheek and paw. I…could actually get used to this.

I chuckled at the easily lead Mice, reminding myself of most of Dossur kind on Prime. Or…pretty much everyone for that matter. Whatever the Exterminators or the Government says is never questioned. I wonder how Humanity is going to affect the Universe as a whole when we are already so set in our ways?

I blinked such thoughts away as a surprisingly Darwin-like Dos-Hamster rose flatulently up from the floor shavings of the cage. He kind of reminded me of myself in a way. Very relaxed and jovial. I was known as the more outspoken of my friend circle and sometimes just as gassy. Not that anyone ever smelled it. Being small did have its perk sometimes.

The Hamsters tried multiple ways to exit the cage, including a rather impressive living tower to check the latch, a comment from Scruffier Darwin making me chitter. *A circus, huh? Definitely something I’ll ask Dillon about later*. Needless to say, it didn’t work. But Mooch the bug made it back and was sent to get help…all the while flirting with death along the way. Never thought I would see PD in an insect.

After Ben and Ms. Helper fail to talk to corporate about getting their operation back, it cuts back to Blaster using Farty Darwin as a flamethrower. I…never thought Farts could be flammable, only Humans…Other Darwin claims the only way of getting out is being…adopted? Something tells me he’s been trying for a while.

In walks a pack of Humans, one adult and two cubs…I…suppose they could be a family. Something about the cubs I didn’t like.

The team ‘goes to work’ by acting all cute to get…adopted?...I guess to get out of their glass prison. It was humorous, especially with Speckles, who immediately gave up and burrowed into the floor flakes, getting a chitter out of me. The girl, as Dillon mentioned female Human cubs are called, chose Juarez. I wasn’t surprised, she was the cutest by far. But at the mention of bows and dresses, both of which Dillon assured me were cutesy clothing, she started threatening the girl. I couldn’t blame her.

Dillon looked up at me in what I assumed was a thoughtful expression. “Don’t even think about it, you little monster. I don’t do cute!” That didn’t change the expression on his face, though. So I shoved it back into my chest, satisfied at his muffled complaints as the movie showed plumpy not-Darwin getting chosen by the Boy. Everything seemed to be going well when…There was a different cage with what looked to be a Harchen without arms or legs curled like a rope! The boy rears back and launches not-Darwin towards it, making me squash Dillon’s face all the more as I was reaffirmed on my initial opinions on those little Vialpecs called cubs.

I was confused by the scary music, as the reptiles side facing eyes obviously signified a prey species, when it suddenly lunged at the glass open mouthed with its…fangs!? Of course it was a bloody predator! I…I hate it, I hate everything about Earth’s ecosystem! How have Humans survived this long without-! Oh…right, they are smaller. Brahking movie throwing me off. But I’d still stomp any so called Snakes, as not-Darwin put it during his taunting as he figured he was safe.

The boy ends up choosing Blaster and the family leaves the store, leaving Darwin, Speckles and Narwin behind with the others. Which seemed to be the better option, because after a vague scene with Killian and some official human yelling at him about listening harder to…Mr bad guys doings, it cuts to the girl doing horrific things to Juarez. My eyes widened as I saw first paw what the dress and bow things were, the garish colors clashing terribly with her fur and…colored claws? That…That might actually be something to look into. Krakotl dye their feathers sometimes, I suppose fashion could be subjective among species. “I wouldn’t dress  you up like that, but I could definitely recommend my taking you to a few big and tall stores so you could see if our fashion would suit you.” Dillon offered. A trend setting Dossur would stand out, so I didn’t think that would be good for me. Standing out is the last thing someone like me needed to do.

Back at the pet store, Speckles is pretending to be dead so the shop owners will bury him in the back yard. Which would make sense, with him practically being a spineless Gojid. It seems to work…until a trash truck pulls in front of the store, diverting the humans to just…throwing Speckles into the back! Annnnnd, he’s dead. First death in the movie and it’s by a machine crushing Speckles! “I thought you said this was a movie for children!” I blurted out, turning Dillon to face the screen, as if scolding him.

“I-...it is, it is! It’s just, well…It’s building with tragedy and hardships! They knew there was danger in their line of work. Kind of like your exterminators. It can’t always be sunshine and rainbows, even with a childrens movie. One of my favorite movies as a child had the main kid’s mother dying at the very beginning and it was still a beautiful movie! I promise you, it gets better. Trust me.” I grumble, still feeling bad for Speckles after such a needless death. “I have to admit though, that scene is a bit awkward with how sudden it was. They could have showed a little more emotion.”

Not really caring at the moment, it wasn’t until Ben and lady face were back at the warehouse, sitting outside in the van, when I only then noticed thousands of bugs swarming the place. I almost gagged before realizing, because of course they were, the production value on them was too good for them to be anything other than plot devices. I was proven correct when one of them steals the chip that Darwin downloaded the files onto while the other humans were understandably freaking out about the whole ordeal. Well, good to know something was going right in this nightmare of a movie.

Back at the pet shop, it turns out that Darwin and Narwin are brothers because of a certain fur discoloration on their rumps, which I guess made sense. “Kind of weird though. I thought the same thing about Juarez and Blaster at the start, looking so similar. The consistancies in this movie are staggering.” I said mostly to myself, but Dillon still nodded quietly. Wait, Did Darwin just call Narwin Hurley? Did they already say his name and I missed it? Hurley. Finally, I have a name for that scruffy chubster of a Dossur! I’m actually growing fond of his antics though. 

Darwin denies being family with Hurley, despite the mood of the moment, claiming to be engineered and special or something like that. That made Hurley sad. Dangit Darwin, I liked you. Hurley is the new Darwin now.

They find out that the little hamster was hiding a trap door under his house, making Speckles’ death unnecessary. *Ow…my heart!* Thus allowing Darwin to escape the cage, but not until what I can only call a reverse touching scene about Hurley telling Darwin that he needs to go. It made me laugh at the absurdity of how such a scene usually goes the other way. Once Darwin is out, it looks like Hurley and the Hamster are back to normal, when he suddenly kicks Hurley from behind, sending him out as well. Little jerk he is. Good, I wanted the movie to keep Hurley, anyways. But the fall made me cringe, though. Even I would be feeling a landing like that.

Hurley catches up with Darwin and after being told to go back, tries to act all brave until he sees…He sees… “Dillon…” I spoke through gritted teeth, squeezing the being I was beginning to regret calling my friend.

“C-Cat! That’s a Cat! Another pet we keep, on top of Dogs!”

“And they eat?”

“Rodents, Squirrels, stuff like that. BUT, they…can also be friendly with them. I’ve seen it. Like I said, in reality, they are small compared to you.” He wasn’t moving in my grasp, as if he thought I would squeeze him tighter if he struggled. He was right, by the way.

Hurley also didn’t like the ‘Cat’ and stayed with Darwin. While all of that is happening, It turns out Mr. Bad guy is talking with someone with obvious voice changing software, an engineer, by the sound of it. Something to do with satellites and space junk. Communications and the like.

Mooch, on the other paw, has other plans elsewhere, wherever Ben is. He ‘tells’ Ben about the Pet Shop. Too little too late, sadly. But it seems Killian's goons are already ahead, surprisingly enough. Arriving at the shop before ominously cutting away again. I wish this movie would stop jumping around so much and just stick with a single point!

As if to reward me…in the worst possible way, more dogs and Darwin and Hurley have to get past them. A Primitive tire does the trick, which, I have to admit, was something I needed to try in public. Might start a stampede. I chittered at that thought.

Ben and Lady arrive at the Pet Shop, just to go away disappointed, as always. Then, surprise! Jump again, back to the children who took Juarez and Blaster home, but the son this time. Just as soon as the boy was putting blaster on a little toy car, my stomach growled underneath Dillon, making him look up with wide eyes. They weren't the eyes of someone who was scared, more like curious. 

“Really? You're hungry already? I saw how much you ate in the cafeteria. I don't even know where you put it all! Maybe that's why your stomach has been the perfect bag to lay on for this movie.” I knew that he was teasing, but I couldn't deny what he was saying. I didn't even hide the bloom that was starting to spread over my nose and ears. 

“What can I say?” I tried another human grin, not showing my teeth this time while looking away. This seemed to have the desired effect, for when I peeked back down at him, I could see by the light of the movie that his face was also turning a shade of red. “It's been a long time since I've laid down to watch an entire movie before. This one's almost done, right?”

“Uhhhh…about halfway.” My body jerked beneath him, causing him to slosh back and forth a little. *Okay, I know I have some added fluff underneath my fur, but it's not that bad! Is it?* He seemed to notice as well as he stroked my belly in what I assumed was an appreciative way. 

“Halfway? That's like a quarter of a claw! Is this, like, the normal length for most movies in human media?”

“Oh yeah. There's this movie series called The Lord of the rings. Medieval old style adventure with magic and swords and monsters and whatnot. The average runtime of each one of them is about 3 hours.” I had to stop at this, thinking about what I had learned so far about human time and did some math in my head. 

“You mean to tell me, humans are capable of sitting down for three quarters of a claw, just to watch a movie?” I'm sure my ears were splayed out in exasperation as I gave Dillon my full attention, movie forgotten at this point. He seemed to realize that and finally paused it during an especially fur raising scene between the boy and Blaster.

“It's not normal, no. The Lord of the rings is an outlier. Normal movie run times are the same as this movie. About an hour and a half. We have special buildings called theaters that people can buy tickets to and go to watch movies with snacks and drinks. It's not as popular nowadays as it used to be over a century ago. I hear that theaters were all the craze back then. Now you can just pay a subscription service to watch the movie from your own home for the same price It would cost to go watch it in a theater. I think they still have theaters out of respect for history. I personally enjoy still going to watch a movie in the theater, but it's not as popular as it used to be. It's very rare that a theater will have all of their seats full because of the release of a new movie.”

“And you expect me to watch this in one sitting? I'm not exactly the most hyperactive of Dossur, But even I need to get up and move around every now and then. Can we stop the movie right here and talk a little? There are a few things that I was meaning to ask you. And if I heard right while we we're watching the movie, you wanted to tell me something as well.” Now I could definitely tell that he was blooming. 

“I-I did…yeah” Was that a stutter? It almost resembled a Dossur chitter, But without the humor. I went to sit up, thankful that the bed had a high ceiling, just not a lot of space to lay down, until he was sitting on my thighs. It was kind of a weird sensation, having never had someone my size to sit there before. But something about it felt right, especially since it was him. I kept one paw around him for support as I used the other to push the button to turn the bedroom lights back on, making us both squint momentarily. 

I could see him take a deep breath while closing his eyes, as if readying himself for what he was about to say. As he looked up at me, I could feel a determination in his gaze. A focus that hadn't been there before. “I wanted to tell you about my dream earlier. The truth, this time.”

I'm 14 years into a daily mj binge and at this point my dopamine feels fully wiped out. It's made it impossible to have the motivation to quit smoking and get my life back on track again.

I'm looking to buffer my dopamine during the first month of quitting to ride out the withdrawals, as well as using NAC for the first month.

Can anyone share insight into buffering dopamine. I'm looking to buffer dopamine during the dopamine drop of quitting and assist with motivation to do things like make healthy food, go to the gym, and get through my work without crashing totally and resulting in another failed quit.

To steal an eloquent expression from another redditor, I've become a full on pot zombie and need to get off the source for at least a couple of months to reset my systems. 

I'm looking to only take the tyrosine and NAC for the first month and then discontinuing.

I'm looking at also taking magnesium, Fish oil, and D3 daily from next week as my daily stack and could use some insight here on this. I don't have a lot of cash for supps so I'm trying to keep it reasonable.

Also looking at having 100mg l theanine as and when needed with my coffee.

Specifically,  when in the day or night would you take the above, I heard tyrosine on empty stomach is best, but what about NAC and the others?

Obviously there is a whole spectrum of life changes that need to happen for quitting mj and that supplements aren't the silver bullet, but in terms of kickstarting a change, I'm looking to buffer thr dopamine in the first month, then taking it from there

1h3p7yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/1h3p7yi/the_gender_pay_gap_how_numbers_hurt_my_feelings/,"The Gender Pay Gap: How Numbers Hurt My Feelings, So They’re Probably Sexist","
Let’s talk about the gender pay gap, or as I like to call it, The Official Victimhood Olympics. We’ve all seen the numbers: “Women make 82 cents for every dollar a man makes.” Tragic, right? But don’t you dare ask for context, Karen, because the second you do, you’re basically saying you hate women and probably also puppies.

See, here’s the thing: some people actually think we should look at facts to explain this gap. Facts like, oh, I don’t know, men taking higher-paying, more dangerous jobs while women take lower-paying, less stressful ones. But no! That’s too much work. It’s much easier to cry foul than to realize that logging and kindergarten teaching are not the same thing.

But let’s dive deeper into this sexist conspiracy. Did you know that women disproportionately choose college majors like English, art history, and sociology? Meanwhile, men are out here picking fields like engineering and computer science. Because obviously, when Chad was 18, he thought to himself: “I better major in petroleum engineering so I can sabotage women in 15 years.”

And let’s not forget hours worked. Men, for some inexplicable reason, tend to put in more overtime and work longer weeks. Meanwhile, women might take time off to, oh I don’t know, grow humans inside their bodies or take care of their families. But you know what? Biology is patriarchy too, obviously.

The best part? Even when you try to explain these things with numbers, people just plug their ears and scream, “82 CENTS! 82 CENTS!” louder than a kid in a candy store. Because numbers are hard, guys. It’s much easier to be a victim than to say, “Hmm, maybe life choices and market demand are factors here.” Nah. Victimhood is way more fun.

Here’s my favorite: the “invisible sexism” argument. It goes like this: even though women and men work in different fields, put in different hours, and sometimes take years off for parenting, it’s all STILL sexism because… vibes? I don’t know. I guess the patriarchy just magically makes your paycheck smaller every time you order a coffee. 

But wait—it gets better. Women now outnumber men in college enrollment, meaning they have more degrees, more opportunities, and more career flexibility than ever before. And yet, somehow, it’s still Chad’s fault that he chose construction management over poetry. Shame on him.

The solution? Simple: Let’s ignore irrelevant details like job type, hours worked, career breaks, or risk levels. Instead, let’s make every job pay the same amount. Coal miners and Instagram influencers? Equal pay. Neurosurgeons and Starbucks baristas? Same salary. After all, it’s only fair.

In conclusion: the gender pay gap isn’t about choices, work hours, or job types. It’s about feelings. And if your feelings say, “I deserve a CEO’s salary even though I majored in underwater basketball weaving,” who are we to argue? Facts are overrated anyways. ",0,1733008783.0,entp,21,0.43,False

I have always struggled with eating food and obsessively trying to do a new diet and not following through. I would binge eat and then purge constantly. 

I know food is a huge issue for me, not being able to eat affects my mood big time, and I often feel really out of it at the end of the day. I started setting alarm reminders to eat but I just end up turning them off. 

I’m not trying to diet right now, but eating on stimulants when I already had existing eating disorders is really challenging me. I started stimulants 3 months ago and I’m recently diagnosed. 

I think yesterday in total I ate 2 mini sweet peppers, one small granola bar, a bite of apple, a mini yogurt drinkable and a lot of coffee. 

Today I have had only coffee and two bites of a croissant. 

I don’t have an appetite ever until it’s too late, I feel sick when I eat in the morning, and I find anything I do eat to be kinda off putting. So many years of researching foods that are over processed or bad in other ways and I’m turned off by a lot of things now. I can’t stomach anything unless I smoke. 

Any advice on how to force myself thru this? It’s been getting worse and I’m worried the effects on my body. I just don’t know. I either forget to eat, don’t want to eat, or try to and feel like shit so only eat small amounts of things. Also, I live mobile and

I somewhat recently discovered this sub, and it has opened a whole new world of understanding of these feelings I’ve had my whole life. The empty feelings around the holidays, the hole I feel after every birthday passes, anxiety, depression, imposter syndrome all of that.  I’ve been thinking about posting for a while, but just worked up the courage and effort to do so.

I was adopted through an open adoption. My twin and I were born into chaos—our bio mom was struggling with addiction and homelessness, and she ended up going to prison for a little while. Both my brother and I were born with drugs in our systems. Along with this, both of my bio parents have children with other people, so it’s not like they didn’t want kids at all.

On top of that, I’m Native American, and in order for my conservative white evangelical Christian adoptive parents to adopt us, the tribe had to disown us. I’ve always carried the weight of that loss, even though I didn’t fully understand it as a child. Growing up, I had a longing to know and understand my culture, but that connection was completely severed when I was adopted. My adoptive parents, though well-meaning in some ways, weren’t equipped to help me with that. Now, as I’ve gotten older, that void feels bigger than ever.

My adoptive parents couldn’t conceive, tried for years, tried adopting internationally, and eventually sold their truck to adopt me and my twin. On the surface, it might sound like a selfless story, but growing up wasn’t easy. My mom has narcissistic tendencies, and I experienced a lot of emotional manipulation and abuse. I was constantly walking on eggshells, trying to avoid triggering her or dealing with guilt trips, silent treatments, and gaslighting. Faith was used as a weapon, and it was all I knew. I also grew up hearing how terrible it was for my adoptive mom trying to get pregnant and how “every month was like a loss, even though we were never pregnant.” 

I grew up knowing my bio family, and for a while, it felt like I had two worlds—a past and a present—that I could live in simultaneously. We’d meet up once or twice a year growing up, and there was always this surface-level connection, like we were playing roles.

But things changed as I got older. In college, I moved to the same town as my bio family, and my APs moved as well within an hour of my college. My bio parents ghosted me every time I reached out. I’d invite them to grab coffee or come to an event like one of my volleyball games and I’d be met with silence or a “we’ll be there” only for them to not show up and no message or reason given. It was like the open adoption I had known my whole life was a lie—or at least not the connection I thought it was. My twin and I are not close. He was able to leave the chaos before I could and that put a large riff between us. 

Now, my APs have sold my childhood home and moved to the middle of nowhere. I know they were trying to start fresh after everything they “gave up” to have us, but it feels like I’m being abandoned all over again. Especially because my husband and I hope to expand our family in the near future, and I desire a supportive family culture (my in-laws are phenomenal, but I hoped my APs could get their shit together and be that too).

I’m realizing that so many of the relationships I thought were solid were built on shaky ground. My bio family has drifted away, my adoptive parents are retreating into their own world, and I feel stuck in the middle—like I don’t truly belong anywhere. It feels like they “did their job” and now they are back to doing whatever they want without considering the impact on me. On top of that, I’m grappling with this deep yearning to understand my Native heritage—a part of me that was taken away before I even had a chance to know it, but also I am VERY white passing. My native features primarily show through in my long dark straight hair, and my face shape. So I feel like I don’t even have the right to know. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you cope with feeling like both your “before” and “after” worlds were slipping away? And for those who have also lost their cultural ties through adoption, were you able to regain any of that?Right now, I’m just trying to figure out how to keep my head above water.",22,1733008154.0,Adopted,2,1.0,False

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely impersonal world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. I've posted before but things just fizzled out after a few days.. Online communication is weird isn't it ? So yeah, I'm keepin my spirits high and up... let's give this another chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and analyse the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL .. We can watch true-crime or horror but don't worry I'll watch family guy with you if that's too scary :D

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

\- Got 4 tattoos.

\- I'm originally Turkish. Turns out people care about the least important thing about me more than anything so there you go :))

Other stuff :

188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair (with a blonde undertone), beard and moustache

Ultimately I'm looking for something profound, deep and love-fueled... but yeah let's start by being friends, and then let's see where we can lead it !",0,1733008128.0,ForeverAloneDating,2,0.5,False

When I first came across this product, I was skeptical. A bottle that promises weight loss and better energy simply by drinking water? It sounded too good to be true. But something about the concept stuck with me—perhaps the idea of combining ancient crystal healing with modern health goals. Little did I know, this simple decision to try it would lead to a remarkable transformation in my life.

At the time, I was struggling with low energy and a few extra pounds that just wouldn’t budge. My daily routine felt like a grind, and no matter how much water I drank or how clean I ate, I couldn’t shake that sluggish feeling. So, I took the leap and ordered it, figuring the worst-case scenario would be that I’d just end up with a stylish water bottle.

From the moment I unboxed it, I knew this wasn’t just another ordinary product. The quality of the bottle and the crystals inside exuded a sense of purpose. It felt as though I was holding a small piece of nature in my hands—something real, something powerful.

I committed to drinking at least two liters of water from it daily, as recommended. The first week, I noticed a subtle but undeniable shift. My energy levels, which had been on life support, began to stabilize. I didn’t need that second cup of coffee to power through my mornings anymore. By the second week, something even more surprising happened: I started feeling lighter—not just physically, but emotionally. It was as though the stress and tension that had been weighing me down were slowly dissolving.

By the end of the first month, I had lost nearly eight pounds. And the best part? I didn’t change much else in my routine. Sure, I made an effort to move more and eat sensibly, but I wasn’t killing myself in the gym or starving through fad diets. It was almost as if my body was finally responding the way it was meant to.

What’s most fascinating is how it made me *feel*. There was this newfound sense of clarity and calm, as if the water I was drinking was somehow restoring balance not just to my body, but to my mind. I later learned that the crystals in the bottle—like amethyst, clear quartz, and citrine—are associated with properties like energy amplification, emotional balance, and positivity. Whether you believe in that or not, the results speak for themselves.

Now, a few months in, I’m down 18 pounds. My energy is through the roof, my focus is sharper than it’s been in years, and even my friends and family have noticed the difference. People keep asking me what I’m doing, and I can’t help but smile because the answer is so simple: I started drinking water in a new way.

I’m not here to make bold claims or promise miracles. I’m just sharing my story. For me, it wasn’t just a water bottle—it was the catalyst for a much-needed change. If you’re someone who’s been feeling stuck, tired, or just not yourself, maybe it’s time to try something different. You never know what small decision might end up being the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. It certainly was for me.

I know what you’re probably thinking—how can a water bottle infused with crystals make such a dramatic difference? Trust me, I asked myself the same thing when I first started. So, I did a deep dive into the science behind it, because if I was going to keep recommending this to friends and family, I needed to know exactly *why* it works. What I found absolutely blew me away.

At its core, the concept behind this product revolves around two ideas: hydration and the potential energetic properties of crystals. Let’s start with hydration, because no matter what else is going on, staying properly hydrated is non-negotiable for overall health. But here’s the thing—most of us drink water that’s filtered, treated, and, well, lifeless. The idea here is to “revitalize” your water by allowing it to interact with natural elements, in this case, a carefully selected blend of nine crystals.

Now, let’s talk about those crystals. Each one included in this product isn’t just thrown in for aesthetic appeal; they’re chosen for their unique properties, which are rooted in centuries of traditional healing practices. For example:

* **Amethyst** is believed to promote calm and balance, which can help reduce stress—a key factor in weight gain.
* **Citrine**, often referred to as the “success stone,” is said to boost energy and metabolism, aligning perfectly with weight-loss goals.
* **Clear Quartz** is considered a master healer, thought to amplify the properties of other crystals.
* **Green Aventurine** has long been associated with promoting overall wellness and comfort, while also supporting digestion.

Modern science might not fully explain how these crystals interact with water on an energetic level, but there’s growing interest in the field of vibrational medicine. Water is a unique substance—it’s not just a liquid; it has the ability to store and transmit energy. Some researchers suggest that the molecular structure of water can be influenced by its environment, including exposure to natural elements like crystals. This is where the infusion process comes in. By allowing water to “sit” with these crystals, it’s believed to absorb subtle energetic vibrations that can enhance your body’s natural systems.

And while the science of vibrational energy might still be emerging, the impact of mindfulness and intention is well-documented. Drinking from this bottle felt like a ritual for me—something intentional that reminded me to prioritize my health. It wasn’t just water; it was an experience. Every sip was a moment to recalibrate and refocus on my goals.

Then there’s the thermogenic effect, which I didn’t understand at first. By keeping your body hydrated with water infused in this way, you may naturally boost your metabolic processes. Hydration supports every system in your body, from digestion to circulation, and when your body is functioning optimally, you burn calories more efficiently. Combine that with the energizing and stress-reducing properties often attributed to crystals, and you’ve got a synergy that can genuinely help tip the scales—literally.

What’s more, there’s something empowering about incorporating a tool like this into your daily life. It’s easy to let self-care fall by the wayside, but when you invest in something that’s both practical and purposeful, it’s like a daily nudge to keep showing up for yourself.

Science may still be catching up to ancient wisdom, but the results I’ve experienced are impossible to ignore. Whether it’s the hydration, the crystals, or just the act of doing something intentional for my health, I can confidently say this product has changed the game for me. And while not every tool works for everyone, sometimes the simplest shifts can lead to the most profound results.

**1. Does it really work for weight loss?**  
In my experience, yes—but it’s not magic. Drinking from this product supported my weight-loss journey by keeping me hydrated and improving my energy levels, which naturally led to better habits. The infused water felt more satisfying, and I found myself reaching for healthier options without forcing it. It’s a tool that complements your efforts, not a replacement for them.

**2. How long before you see results?**  
For me, subtle changes started in the first week—like better energy and less bloating. By the end of the first month, I’d lost nearly eight pounds without drastic lifestyle changes. Everyone is different, but consistency is key. Commit to drinking from it daily, and give your body time to respond.

**3. Is it just placebo?**  
This is a valid question! While some benefits might come from the placebo effect, I’ve experienced tangible results that go beyond expectation. Whether it’s the hydration, the infused energy of the crystals, or the mindfulness it encouraged, I genuinely felt—and saw—a difference.

**4. Can I use it with other beverages?**  
The short answer: stick to water. The bottle is specifically designed for water infusion, as other liquids might not interact with the crystals in the same way. Plus, staying hydrated with water is essential for any health goal.

**5. Is it safe?**  
Absolutely. The crystals used are carefully selected and encased in a way that ensures no direct contact with the water, making it safe to drink. Always make sure you’re following the care instructions provided to keep your bottle clean and functional.

**6. Can I take it on the go?**  
Yes! One of the best parts is its portability. I take mine to work, to the gym, and even on weekend trips. It’s durable and designed for everyday use, so you can stay hydrated wherever you are.

**7. Do I need to recharge the crystals?**  
Some people like to ""cleanse"" their crystals by rinsing them or placing them in sunlight or moonlight, but this is entirely optional. The crystals are functional as-is and don’t lose their properties over time.

**8. Is it worth the price?**  
For me, it’s been one of the best investments in my health. Not only did it support my weight-loss journey, but it also gave me a sense of mindfulness and intentionality that extended beyond just hydration. You’re not just buying a water bottle—you’re investing in a tool for your well-being.

**9. What happens if it doesn’t work for me?**  
Like any health tool, results vary from person to person. However, the good news is that most purchases come with a satisfaction guarantee, giving you peace of mind to try it out for yourself.

**10. Can it replace other weight-loss tools?**  
Think of it as a complement, not a replacement. It’s not a magic solution, but it can amplify your efforts by supporting hydration, metabolism, and energy. Use it alongside a balanced diet and regular activity for the best results.

Right now we live in New Orleans with $1,600 rent but have the option of a basically free house in a very small town in rural midwest Georgia. I grew up in the area & didn’t love it. It’s very conservative & religious, & we are neither. I got bullied a fair amount growing up. 

The New Orleans house fits our family size. The GA house is short one bedroom so we are discussing putting a tiny home or small RV in the backyard. My youngest child thinks it sounds fun & private but I worry that will get old. Not paying rent would help us save money to move to a better area of the state in a few years though.

Youngest child is a high school freshman at a super progressive charter school, has good friends there & other close longtime friends in the city. Overall we love New Orleans but it’s not cheap & has issues with crime, infrastructure, & natural disasters.

My father is almost 80 & lives with us. He is bored of the city, but is able to take public transit around, walk to a coffee shop down the street every morning, & get good care at the VA Hospital. He likes to briefly check out live music, festivals, & things like that around the city. He hates the cold, & is interested most in states out west, like Arizona.

Older child is a sophomore in college 2 hours from New Orleans & 8 hours from GA. She does not have a car but needs to go to the orthodontist in New Orleans every 6 weeks for the next 1.5 years, but says she could get rides from friends. She is open to us living in a different state from her but I am hesitant.

The town in GA is cute enough but very small, not even a coffee shop. The two largest towns for serious shopping, theaters, etc are each an hour away. Concerts would be 1.5-2 hours away.

I have better employment opportunities in New Orleans (tourism based.) My partner is a teacher so he can work anywhere, but likes the school in GA where he used to teach & would probably prefer it. His salary is similar in both places.

New Orleans is more expensive as far as things like utilities & car maintenance, but not massively so.

We realize that wherever we choose will most likely be the state where my youngest will attend college, probably somewhere like Georgia State in ATL or University of Louisiana in Lafayette.

Should we stay in New Orleans, go for the free house in GA, or go someplace entirely new that aligns more with our values? New Orleans used to be a pretty insulated blue bubble in a very red state, but that was under a Democratic governor. Our new governor is pretty nuts. Both kids are female so we do worry about things like their reproductive healthcare. GA is more of a purple state but the area we’re looking at is super conservative. The school my youngest would attend there is very small & very rural, & we worry she won’t find any of “her people” there. 

Any insight or ideas are very much appreciated. I want to do what’s best for my kids & Dad, & no answer seems clear.",4,1733008097.0,SameGrassButGreener,6,0.75,False

So not many people that aren’t into biology and chemistry know that, Alcohol and Caffeine are more effective In the time you feel the effect when the beverage is carbonated. It’s why 1 shot equals 1 beer in feeling as a general rule. It’s also why a 300mg of caffeine coffee won’t smack as hard as something like a bang energy drink. (I read that somewhere like 6 years ago and experimented on myself)

Now my real question is; How does Nitrogen infusion compare? 

I have been trying these “super dry” monster nitros to see if I can notice anything but I’m pretty much always under the effect of caffeine now a days so I can’t reallyyyy tell. (I don’t consume alcohol anymore so my real interest is caffeine)

Is there any public studies that point to the effect difference of the methods of carbonation? Is the bioavailability the same or does one have slightly better %? Would the effect combination be possible/any better than either of the gasses solo? 

I mainly ask because I’m super interested in making my own beverages, and I know there are other people who understand this better than myself so.. thank you guys very much in advance.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”
