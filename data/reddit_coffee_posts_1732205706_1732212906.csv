By Ringo Cross

*“Be careful whose soul you steal. You may never be able to forget their screams. Terrance... Your time isn’t over... I bind your soul to my light. I am your Savior... Here... drink my blood... Consume my flesh... Allow my undying sacrament to be your guiding force.”*

\* \* \* \*

His voice jolted me back into the pits of reality and darkness. Just when I had finally forgotten my despair! Just when all the light had finally gone away! Curse the fool who had called upon my shiftless spirit!

My eyes shot open. I gasped for breath, but none came to me. I-I couldn’t breathe! Panic overloaded my fractured mind. Every inch of my flesh afire. The pain... I could feel it in my bones. It was like my soul had been pulled away from the lake of fire, midscream. My unholy torment left me paralyzed in fear and anguish.

Wait. I remember now. I was... I was here! Down here, on this cold, wet basement floor! That’s right—they did this! They took everything away from me!

“*Cursed!* How did I? ... W-Who’s responsible for bringing me back?!”

That’s when I saw his boot next to my head. I slowly gazed up and stared directly into the lifeless eyes of the one who had brought me back.

No... He definitely wasn’t one of those who was responsible for my death. He was a different monster altogether. I wish I could say I owed him a debt of gratitude, but his *gift* turned out to be a curse.

“I thought I was—""

“Dead?” he asked.

“Yeah, I thought it was over?”

“Death can be too forgiving.”

Blood gushed from my mouth when I tried to speak again. It was odd... it was as if my body was trying to expel whatever was left of my essence.

“How is this possible?”

“All is possible through me.”

“Who the hell are you?”

He crouched down and began to examine me with those soulless eyes of his. Satisfied by whatever it was he was searching for, he spoke: “You were dead, but *I* resurrected you. I brought you back as one of my children.”

His appearance startled me. I swear. He couldn’t have been any older than seventeen. And his movements, they were human in nature, but very strange. So mystical in fact, there was nothing I could compare them to. He moved and swayed with a grace that was divine.

His purple and black robe concealed his physical features. Glyphs and symbols of all nature seemed to be weaved into the fabric. Some glowed, others flittered, and even stranger, a few of them whispered to my subconscious. I felt dizzy just gazing at them.

His voice was deep and dazzling. It didn’t match his youthful appearance at all. His hair was white and stark as the snowy weather that dotted my blighted city. For some reason, I found myself drawn to him.

He looked down upon me with such intrigue and pity, as if he knew my pain. His smirk was uncanny. It was like he could read my thoughts. He stood back up and placed his hands inside of the loose-fitting garment, dawning the thing more like a cape than an actual robe.

“You remember? Good. The more you embrace the pain the stronger you’ll be because of it.”

“W-Who are you?”

“I am your Creator.”

“What does that mean?”

“You are the fourth I have chosen.”

“What the hell did you do to me?!”

“Humph. You are a revenant. And you will forever be one of my children. You see, I was the first of our kind. I am the strongest. Do not take my gift lightly.”

“How? Wh-Why? What do I do?!”

“By drinking from my cup and feeding upon the bread, you have partaken in undead communion. There is no return. You have transcended, my child. You stand between the bounds of living and unliving.”

I staggered to my feet only to fall on my face. My legs were weak and numb more than any other part of my body. It was strange. My very existence, it just didn’t feel right. It felt like I was trapped inside of a shell that no longer belonged to me.

I was completely numb. Taste, touch, smell... all the senses I had taken for granted were gone. I rolled over on my back and grimaced in anger. Pain was the only thing that reminded me I still existed. It flowed through me like the blood that once flowed through my veins.

“Seek revenge on those who have wronged you. For only through the blood of sinners, will find the answers you seek. Do not disappoint me, my child.”

I watched as the being before me faded, as if he were an apparition. I knew trauma could do terrible things, like play tricks on the mind. So, it was difficult to know if what I was experiencing was real, or some sick expression of a dying man’s imagination.

Memories never died if they hurt enough. They might hide somewhere deep in the recesses of the mind, but they were there, waiting to be seized. I closed my eyes and seized the chain that was wrapped around my neck. It was another painful reminder of what had happened.

They beat me, tortured me, twisted my mind with their foul threats of execution. The bastards left me here to wilt on this damp basement floor like a mongrel. I could hear laughter and banter coming from upstairs. It was as if my existence meant nothing... This was unforgivable! In a sudden moment of grief and disbelief, I gritted my teeth and asked God why this had happened to me.

I used the bitterness to fuel me. I inched my way towards the staircase. My arms shook from the exertion, but I could care less. I was going to make those bastards pay. All I could think about was my wife and daughter. I tried to cry, but I couldn’t. This... this *curse* had taken my tears as well as my humanity.

My torture had lasted the whole day and night. They wanted to know the name of my supplier. I-I couldn’t tell them. I wouldn’t break. It was a hopeless plight without any light. I-I was doomed to an ill fate from the start. I *had* to take my secret to the grave. I-I couldn’t risk the cartel finding out that I had told without permission. I knew how they operated. Better for me to die at the hands of a few gangsters than jeopardize the lives of those closest to me by snitching.

Touching that first step with my fingertips snapped me out of my chain of depressive thoughts. Getting this far was somewhat of an accomplishment. I pressed on, but before I could seize another step, I was again reminded of my ordeal by the chain around my neck. The cold iron stopped me in my tracks. I grimaced at the thought. Here I was, chained to this dirty floor like a dog. How degrading and twisted were the possibilities.

This emblem of my suffering only added fuel to the pyre of rage that consumed me. I grabbed the chain with both hands and broke it. I was surprised by my sudden surge of strength. *Good. I’ll need it, if I plan on breaking the bastards who did this, I thought.*

I dragged myself up each step and around the bend in the stairwell. When I slithered my way into the kitchen, a man standing by the stove, cooking dope, saw me and began to yelp. His harsh shrills caused the three men sitting at the table to look over in my direction.

They were sitting there smoking cigarettes, listening to gangster music, and playing cards. My untimely entrance caused quite a bit of confusion and fascination. They all stood from the table and paused for a minute, taking a bit of time to take stock of the situation.

I recognized the ringleader almost immediately. His alias was “Big Ed.” He was a tough guy who wouldn’t run or panic in a fight. We had done business together on quite a few occasions. I used him mainly as muscle, whenever I had to meet up with my supplier.

Big Ed let out a riotous laugh when he saw my pitiful state. His laughter was infectious. It caused the two ruffians with him to chuckle at my expense. He shook his head and told one of them, “I thought you took out the trash?” referring to me, of course.

“Aw. Damn. My fault, boss. I thought he was dead! I figured I could get rid of him later.”

“Dumbass,” Big Ed sneered. “Eh. I guess I should’ve just taken out the trash myself. Look at him. You didn’t even make sure he was finished! I’m calling the boss man and telling him how much of a lazy piece of crap you are—as soon as I get through dumping his body.”

“Tch. Come on, Ed! Don’t do that! You know how greedy Martel is. He’ll make me work for free. I’m trying to get those new slides that just came out.”

“Shut up. You need to work a day or two for free. You’re lucky I know your auntie. I’d slap the piss out of you if I didn’t. Where’s the trash bags?”

“In the yard. How many do we need?”

“Eh. The usual, bout six or seven.”

“Alright. Roger that, boss.”

“Hold on. Let me show you how you’re supposed to finish the job when I tell you to put somebody out of their freaking misery,” Big Ed sneered.

He gave the ruffian an irritated look as he walked over and kicked me in the head. It wasn’t a hard blow. It was more in the way you’d kick a wounded dog to see how close it was to death. With a boisterous chuckle, he asked me if I was thirsty.

“Y-Yes...” I uttered.

“You want some water?”

*“P-P-Please!”*

“Too bad, you ugly bugger!”

“He looks dead,” one of the goons chuckled.

“What happened to him?” the other one asked.

“Hell, we beat the brakes off of him last night—*that’s* what happened to his punk ass,” Big Ed laughed as he gave me another dehumanizing kick to the head.

“I don’t know fellas. I got a bad feeling about this one. Just be careful,” the cooked chimed in.

“Shut up, scaredy-cat,” Big Ed said with a smirk. He looked over at him and threw in, “A patsy like you probably doesn’t even know how to fire a pistol.”

Too much... It was all just too much to take... I-I closed my eyes and begged for death. *My wife, Terresa! My daughter,* *Jessica!* My life wasn’t mine anymore. It was a cruel role forced upon me by another.

I could hear them mocking my cries as I called out to my wife and to God. Even the cook, who had shown me a modicum of sympathy, partook in the mockery.

*“Why do you hesitate? Slay your tormentors... They cannot be saved. For they are wicked, and wickedness can only be cured by one thing... Fret not over mortal sin. Your soul is no longer bound by mortality.”*

Not only did I hear my creator’s voice, but I could see him standing right in front of me. The vision was clear as day. His words stirred something inside me. A fire ignited in the space that was once my heart. His anger was now my anger... And my pain was now his to keep.

I grimaced wildly while stumbling to my feet. Big Ed took a step back and looked over at the others in surprise. My condition wasn’t funny anymore. Their joy and amusement had given way to fear and bemusement.

I could see it in their eyes. Everyone except Big Ed was ready to flee. He was the only thing holding them back. I shuffled towards them. Every step peeled away the shadows and revealed a bit more of my ghastly face. The tone of their conversation turned desperate and chaotic:

“W-What is he?”

“He’s dead! How is he—""

“Shut up!” Big Ed shouted.

*“Ah! Ahhhhh! No!!!”*

I lunged at the goon to his right. It was awful... I unleashed pure hatred upon his wretched flesh and sinful soul. Inaction was their first reaction to his ear-piercing shrieks. They watched in silence and trepidation as I tore him apart.

His screams were music to my ears. A delicate *symphony of pain* only I understood. Every strike removed chunks of flesh and bone. Where was the laughter? Where had the joy reaped from my sorrow gone? It was quiet enough to hear a church organ as I feasted upon his organs.

“Shoot him, dammit!” Big Ed shouted.

I rose to my feet and took a moment to listen to the sorrow that escaped from the ruffian I had shredded. His feeble whimpers were followed by blood gurgles. His mangled body gave in to suffering and began its final death throes. *Oh,* I relished his anguish. It was only a glimpse into the nightmare they had inflected upon me.

I glared at the survivors while wiping the blood that ran from my mouth. None of them could fully process what they had just witnessed. It took some time, but this sorry excuse for a gangster finally pulled his weapon like his boss, Big Ed, had been demanding ever since I unleashed my rage upon their fellow comrade in arms.

He aimed for my head. His hand shook violently as he tried his damndest to hold back the tide of reluctance. I could see it in his eyes. He was ready to flee not fight:

“S-Stay back!” he cried out.

“What the hell?! Shoot the rotten bastard!” Big Ed shouted. He cursed himself for forgetting to grab his own weapon. He had left it sitting, right there, on the table. If he wanted it, he would have to go through me.

“His eye! It’s... it’s glowing! Oh God, man! He’s a demon!” the goon cried and hollered.

*“Shoot the ugly bastard! Now!”* Big Ed hollered.

He fired a single shot. The thunderous noise caught me and everyone else off guard. The impact of the bullet smashing into my skull caused me to stagger.

He had shot me on the left side of the face. I examined the wound with my fingers. There was... there was no blood? I could feel nothing. Not even as my body pushed the bullet from my brain and fractured temporal bone. The crumpled metal fell to the floor. It all happened so fast. Next thing I know, the skin and bones on my face had begun to heal all on its own. I checked with my fingers again, just to be sure, but failed to find even a single scratch or groove that didn’t belong.

I glared directly into the eyes of my assailant. It was like time stood still. I could hear his heart racing as it palpitated. I could see his legs trembling. Terror had become his newfound friend.

I struck like lightning, degloving his hand holding the gun at the wrist. The sound of flesh peeling from skin was sloshy and guttural. It reminded me of the noise you’d hear while fleshing a deer hide.

The gun fell to the floor. He grabbed his hand, which was nothing more than a bloody pulp, and gazed upon me in utter shock and dismay. His eyes, they held a helplessness that matched the desperation in his fearful plea. He begged for his life. He claimed anything and everything under the sun, all in a vain effort to get me to stop.

This *desire* for blood. It was as swift as it was irresistible. I gave in to its call and pounced on my prey, transforming his pleas into cries of agony. I could feel his vocal cords vibrate under the crushing weight of my fangs. I stole from him, what they had tried to steal from me. The taste of his suffering was sweet.

I drained his blood until I was fully satiated. Then I released my hold on what was once a living, breathing man. His body flopped to the floor. I exhaled in ecstasy. Blood was the only thing I cared for. It was the only thing I could taste. It made me feel alive again!

I smirked wickedly when Big Ed tried to make a run for it. He stumbled to the floor and began slithering and scampering about like an insect. I grabbed him by the neck and lifted him off his feet. He placed his hands over mine and gasped. He tried to speak, but his utterance was too garbled and disturbed for me to grasp.

Staring into his eyes reminded me of the one thing that used to matter most: my wife and child. Because of his recklessness and greed, my family would never be whole. I eased my grip on his neck just enough to let this filthy rat screech and scrape out a few words.

“Who ordered the hit? Speak anything but the truth, and I’ll end your miserable existence.”

*“Please... l-let me go!”*

“Fine.”

When I released my hold, he fell to the floor and buckled to his knees. He grabbed his throat and coughed and wheezed for dear life. He glared up at me, with a look of grief, before crying out the name “Martel!”

*“No! N-Not Martel!*”

“I swear it was him!”

“I told you no lies!”

“N-N-Nobody was supposed to know! I tried to talk him out of it! It—it was a money grab! We figured if we could get you to talk, we could cut you out of the exchange and buy straight from the cartel!”

“All of this was over money?”

“I know! We got greedy!”

“But why? I could have lowered my fee.”

“I know, I know! I tried to talk him out of it I swear! Come on, please! You know how he gets!”

“Eh. Is that so?”

“You were good money! There was no reason to do you dirty. I didn’t have a choice!”

The last part of his statement must’ve really hit home. He started sobbing and repeating, “Dammit, man, this is messed up! This is all messed up!”

I couldn’t believe my ears. I stood there for a moment, stunned by his claims. Martel was the last person I thought capable of backstabbing me. We grew up together. Everything between us seemed grand. In fact, our families had brought in the New Year together.

Who needed enemies with a friend as conniving and deceitful as Martel? I guess you never really know what someone’s truly capable of until they finally give in to their deepest darkest inclination.

I knew what had to be done, but before I could get to it, there was a more immediate loose end requiring my attention: Humph. I watched him, the once proud and mighty “Big Ed,” stagger before me like a child who had lost his mother. He sniveled and driveled out another sad apology. As if admitting to his crimes would somehow absolve him of his sins. When in truth, there would be no light. His death would not be quiet or peaceful. The last thing I was going to do was let his soul slip through my fingers with godspeed. No, not after what he did to me.

“Please! Terrance, man, please! Let me go and I swear you’ll never hear from me again! Please, man, come on, don’t do this! I’m begging you! Please!”

“Heh. So, you’ll disappear, hey?”

“Yes! I swear on everything, bro!”

“That’s odd. I remember begging you to do the same for me when you and your men had me chained to the floor like a dog. Do you remember what you said?”

“Bro, I’m sorry! It-It was—""

“And when you said what you said to me. When you made it clear that I was a dead man, I begged you, personally, as someone I know. I begged you to let me call them... to let me tell my family I love them.”

“Terrance! It wasn’t—""

I slashed him across the face before he could finish blathering out his next lie. My mind was in a dark place when I inflicted injury upon him. His screams were blood curdling. My middle finger caught his eye and tore it from the socket. The ease at which I swiped away flesh reminded me of peeling the skin from an orange.

I flicked his eyeball off my finger. The sound was dense and splashy as it fell to the floor. Bits of flesh and bone oozed down his cheek. The trauma caused him to gasp for breath and the color to drain from his face. His pain and panic were so intense, so visceral; I couldn’t help but notice the way he slowly gave in.

I could see the blood flowing through his veins and arteries. I could see his heart from inside his chest. It was pumping in overdrive in a desperate attempt to keep up with his body’s insatiable demand for blood. He placed his hands to his chest and looked up at me.

“Oh God! Oh God, man! I think I’m having a heart attack! Christ! Save me!”

“You need help?”

“Yes! Oh God!”

I grinned menacingly while offering my hand to this cruel murderer. “I’ll save you, just like you saved me, right?”

He reached for my hand with a shaky hand. He tried to speak, but I don’t know if it was fear or pain that held back the words.

The thought of vengeance was sweet. The darkness took hold and rebuked any hint of kindness I may have otherwise shown him. I smote him in the chest. The viciousness behind my punch shattered his ribcage. I pushed through his chest cavity, scowling wildly like a predator in the process. I did not stop my assault until I had a firm grip on his wretched heart. That’s it... *Yes...* I could feel it beating irregularly. The sensation was gnarly and ungodly. The more I squeezed the more he wheezed in discomfort.

He placed his bloody hands over my arm in a feeble attempt to stop me. He tried to speak. He tried to beg for mercy. His lips quivered as he let out a sad whimper. He was tough; I’ll give him that much. He fought and held on much longer than I thought imaginable.

I made him suffer for it. I made him feel that same hopelessness that was thrust upon me. Death could be slow and burdensome for those unwilling to accept its embrace. Every breath he stole, every ounce he fought, exacted more and more until he finally reached the threshold. This was the last thing I remember before dying. That point where pain and suffering overshadow light and hope.

I sank my fingers into heart muscle. The sudden surge of pain must have jolted his being back into consciousness. He let out a scream that was filled with agony. He cried out for the Lord and so I eased my grip.

His body completely gave out after several minutes of this torture. He collapsed into my arms. His final utterance did little to soothe my rage:

“T-T-Terrance... All you... All you had to do was give us a name. T-T-That’s it...”

“Go rot in Hell!” I snarled before squeezing his heart until I had a fistful of macerated meat. I brought his twitching, writhing excuse for a corpse down to the floor. Then I brought my boot down on his face.

The unsightly sound the heel of my boot made as it first cracked and then dug into skull and brain sounded like a watermelon being bashed by a hammer.

“All I had to do was give up a name, huh? When will the madness end?” I grumbled bitterly to myself.

If I would have given them a name, they probably would have killed me anyway. And if they didn’t, the Sinaloa Cartel would have sent a hit squad to butcher me and my family. I had been warned not to snitch.

I stomped on his face until there was nothing left to stomp on but the floor. That was the first time the revenant side had truly taken over. I looked down at the bloody mess and found myself shocked by my conduct.

“W-What have I done?” I asked myself before vowing to never again lose control. Speaking of control, I was going to show my creator that I wasn’t his puppet.

The sea of thought and dismay I was lost in was broken by a disturbance coming from the other side of the kitchen. I looked over and saw the cook sniveling in the corner. He pissed himself when I began making my way over to him. His demonstration of fear and cowardice proved the lengths some of us would go in order to survive.

“Please! Oh God! No!” he cried out.

“What’s your name, kid?”

“Derrick! Look—I-I have kids!”

He scrambled to retrieve his wallet from his back pocket. I crouched down, right in front of him, and began to examine the photos. He looked so young. It surprised me to see that he had children.

“They’re beautiful.”

“Th-Thank you.”

“How old are they?”

“Two and four,” he whimpered.

“Do you want to see them again?”

“Yes! I love my kids!” he wept.

“Heh. I’m sure you do.”

“Please let me live! Please!”

“I want you to deliver a message.”

“Anything! Just don’t kill me!”

“You know Martel, right?”

“Y-Yes, I work for him.”

“Good. Tell your boss, he’s next. He’ll know who I am. And soon, he’ll know my pain.”

**Chapter 2**

**Reprieve**

The city was a whole different place at night. It’s been a while since I saw some of the things I saw. It brought back memories of my time hustling on the corner when I was supposed to be in school learning.

It pained me to witness the effects my role in the streets had played upon my community. I had done nothing but contribute to the destruction of my city. I ignored the suffering of others in my pursuit of what I thought was happiness. So many wandered the streets, destitute and homeless. Addiction was a ravager who did not play favorites when it came to taking prisoners.

If only I could go back and change things. Perhaps a fate as bad as this was fitting for someone as bad as me? Perhaps I was merely reaping what I had sold for so long. There was so much pain out here to be had after twilight. My pain was merely an ornament compared to some of the misery I saw shambling through the streets.

A few of the more lucid wanderers saw me for what I was. But the vast majority didn’t even bat an eye at my condition. They were too busy trying to get a fix on the vice that had broken them.

The only difference between me and them was that my fix had a unique fuel. One that could only be quenched by the foul blood of my enemies.

It was odd, having no desire for things I once craved. Hunger and thirst were foreign to me. The thought was repulsive to my remaining senses.

It was unusually cold for spring. Not like I could feel it. I made the assessment after passing through an alleyway and seeing a group of undesirables all huddled around a trash bin, they had set alight.

The closer I came to my destination, the closer I was to that growing sea of pain. I couldn’t avoid it anymore. I had to see them, or I would drown under the weight of my own melancholy. The shadows were my friend as I slinked into the backyard of my own home...

There they were... sitting right in the living room; waiting for me to come home. My wife, Teressa, looked as charming as ever. My daughter, Momo, was as sweet as can be. The pain within my undead heart... The tears that would never flow from my eyes again. This vow that we shared... to remain so until death do us part...

Why, God? Why? What did I do to our family? I should have gotten out the game sooner. I knew this life of crime and fast money would lead to doom or an early tomb. And yet I persisted. I chose to make my wife a widow and leave my lovely daughter fatherless.

My gut told me to leave the game, but I foolishly hung around. That wasn’t even what hurt the most. What killed me was knowing how close I was to leaving it all behind. I had to be greedy. I just had to close that one last deal with Martel. How could I have known it would turn out like this? How could I have said no to a friend? It was supposed to be smooth and easy, like all the other deals.

I leaned against the willow tree and watched them. It was unusual for Momo to be up this late. She was just sitting there, quiet as a church mouse, watching cartoons, and sipping hot chocolate.

I knew the only reason she was up this late was because they were waiting for me to walk through the door. It’s funny, I also knew that whenever my wife made coffee, our daughter would ask for a cup. She would tell her ok before sneakily making her a cup of hot chocolate instead. Hah. It was an innocent trick that always put a big smile on our little girl’s face. I understood why she did it. But I also understood that she needed to stop. Momo was a smart cookie; she was going to catch on eventually.

My wife, who I always called Reese, she was pacing back and forth. I could hear her on the phone with my mother. The two arguing back and forth as to where I could be. Seeing her all “stirred up” like this, stirred up another bad memory for me. In my rush to leave that morning, I had forgotten to say goodbye.

After a long sigh, I told myself, “Great. As if I needed anything else to regret.”

As much as I wanted to walk through that patio door and be with them, I knew it wouldn’t be the right thing to do. I had to leave my old life behind. Seeing me like this would cause nothing but grief.

I turned and walked away from my home. The torture I endured that night was nothing compared to walking away from everything I loved. If I could turn my back on my family, I was capable of anything. The thought rattled me. I-I didn’t know myself anymore.

I walked the streets that night for what seemed like an eternity. The later the hour, the more desolate my travels. I stumbled upon a park and found myself sitting on a bench, daydreaming about pushing my daughter on the swings. I would never again get to take her to the park, or out for ice cream on a hot, midsummer day.

I don’t know what happened. I must’ve lost track of time. When I looked up, I could see that it was almost daybreak. The closer it came to dawn, the weaker my body felt. My skin simmered. My bones ached. Dread blossomed inside me. Something instinctively told me I ought to seek shelter before it was too late.

I dashed into the woods. The trees created a canopy, which shielded me from the sudden onslaught of sunlight. I sprinted as fast as I could. The speed at which I traveled surprised me. I probably covered several miles in a matter of minutes. If it wasn’t for the sun, I probably could’ve gone on like that indefinitely.

There it was. Sweet salvation. A blighted house, right next to an open field. It was partially burnt, and striped for scrap like many of the derelict buildings in my city. The neighborhood was bleak. The homes on the block were all either decrepit or leveled. A garden stood in one of the empty lots, closest to the avenue. Its flowers were a testament to faith and new beginnings.

There was a bit of irony to my fate. I had done nothing but contribute to the plight of those who had sown the garden. I justified my drug dealing by blaming others. It took losing everything for me to realize the weight that my crimes carried with them.

I found a window with a loose board to climb through. I had made it to shelter just in time. Any longer and it would have been over for me. The realization was a bitter one. *This* was my new life... hiding like a thief in the light. I was a seed of misfortune that bloomed in a black garden. I struggled with this thought while drifting away into chaotic slumber.

A strange thing happened that morning. I had this dream... no... It, it felt too real to be a dream. It was like I was there. I could see the wind pressing against my overcoat. I was surrounded by trees that were devoid and withering amidst the shadowy undergrowth.

An old cathedral stood on the outskirts of an abandoned village. A faint but oddly familiar voice called out to me. The closer I came to the church, the clearer the words that were intoned.

The land seemed foreign and faraway. Based on the cathedral’s façade, if I had to guess, I’d say the architecture was European. The building had long since been abandoned. The entire right corner had caved in, leaving a massive pile of rubble on the floor of the south tower and aisle.

I stopped dead in my tracks almost as soon as I entered. I gazed around at all the decaying artwork and crumbling masonry. There was a faded fresco on the south wall, which depicted the end times.

What caught my eye was the image of these feral-like creatures. It was odd. They looked like they were human once. Something dark, something apocalyptic had stolen their humanity. They were all wretched, enslaved, and trapped in an abyss. They screamed, scraped, and reached out towards the fading light from the heavens.

The earth had been consumed by fire. What was once fertile, agile land was now barren and scorched by war and famine. I couldn’t really see anything else thanks to the rubble. Even if I could, the painting was severely tarnished. The hole in the ceiling had allowed much of it to rot and peel away from exposure.

Most of the stained glass panels were shattered. The few that remained depicted images of a boy, remarkably similar to my creator, performing miracles and feats of power that seemed impossible. It was... It was difficult to know for sure, but it appeared to me that the boy had suffered and died, before being resurrected. Who or what resurrected him? Who killed him in the first place? All worthy questions. Sadly, there weren’t enough panels left to decipher such bothersome things.

Suddenly, quietly, almost menacingly, the voice, *his* voice, snapped me out of my explorative daze. I looked over at the altar and saw him standing there.

He raised his arms and spoke: “Good. You are stronger. Come. Stand before my altar, my child.”

“Who are you?”

“I am your Creator.”

“Do you have a name?”

“I have a few names.”

“Eh. What is it that you want? Why am I here? Why did you turn me into this thing?”

“You are not a thing. You are a revenant. The fourth I have blessed with divine sustenance. The Lord may be the giver of life. But I am the giver of strife. Do not take what has been given to you with a trifle hand.”

I slowly made my way up the nave. Each step into the candlelight gave me a better glimpse at his face. It’s true, I was angry at him for what he did. But on the other hand, I was grateful for his “gift.” I wanted to know more. I *had* to know more.

The altar was more like a tomb than a slab of holy stone. The carvings told an elaborate tale of loyalty and betrayal. I-I didn’t know what to think. I-I looked up at him. His expression confirmed my suspicion. This was indeed his burial site.

His attire was the same. I had failed to notice the subtleties in his ensemble during our first encounter, due to my weakened state. He was dressed more for combat than sport. His long, brilliant robe shimmered like the stars that blanketed the windy winter night.

“Is this a dream?”

“No.”

“Then what is it?”

“A vision.”

“How? How are you doing this?”

“This is how I commune with my children.”

“How did you become a... a...”

“A god?”

“Yeah.”

With a sinister smirk, he said, “I shall reveal no more until you prove yourself.”

“But how? I don’t get it?”

“Huh. A child is born naked and unaware into a world that overflows with suffering. And like a child, you have been reborn. The cross is yours to bear. Prove yourself worthy and you will not be forsaken.”

Suddenly, out of nowhere, everything around me was set alight. The cathedral walls, the once magnificent artwork, even my creator. He stood there silent and stoic in the flames, staring at me the whole time.

The sight jolted me out of my slumber. I jumped up and glanced around in a fit of panic. It took a while for me to get ahold of myself. The whole thing was more disarming than alarming. His power was one that was going to take me a while to wrap my head around. After exhaling, I muttered to myself, “Thank God that’s over. I hope he doesn’t pull that stunt again.”

My relief was short lived, however. It was dusk. It was time. As much as I hated it; it had to be. A million thoughts collided into a million questions. I could feel the person I used to be slowly slipping. My hunger for revenge was all that mattered.

He who was once my friend was now my enemy. I was going to see to it that he paid. I wanted him to suffer. I wanted him to feel what I felt that night. It’s... it’s the *pain* that gets me every time. How I thought about them, my family, up until my final moments. I died in that basement, cold, alone, fearing the unknown.",2,1732212541.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Should we do a dark accent to make the pendants pop? Molding that fits with mid-mod? Wallpaper? Paint it the same as everything else? Open to any suggestions.

Some of my findings and this is just a small part. Let's start the talk about coffee....

The word cappuccino ""coffee"" comes from the religious group Capuchin which is a branch of the first Franciscan order of religious men which used to wear a brown plane robe and a pointed hood (Italian cappuccio, from which the order takes its name). The lives of its early members were defined by extreme austerity, simplicity, and poverty. Some drinks contain a whopping 70 grams of sugar ""and that's before you add sugar"", equaling 280 calories or more per serving. Having one of these drinks quickly spike your blood sugar levels. This will cause your body to secrete insulin to bring those levels back down, which can leave you feeling hungry and irritable. So the meaning of the word ""cappuccino"" is poverty though hunger and irritablity. Costa know this that's why the name is used it's clever marketing in plain sight. You find there's a lot in plain sight ""it's easy to fool someone"" unless you understand the words and what they mean. Now I'm not saying don't drink it but this may help you understand what It's mean by ""it's easy to fool someone than tell them they've been fooled"". There are more people going down with diabetes now than ever before. This then leads into the pharmacutical industries  ""the science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications, aiming to ensure the safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines"". With out one you don't have the others it's a big money spinner. They don't say ""stop doing it"" they say ""here's a pill to help"". 
You have to make the choice to be healthy.

I became a VP of marketing before the age of 30. I specialize in start ups and have experience with mergers and acquisitions. My department was responsible for 37 locations across 8 states and guess how many employees we had in the department. Two. Me and another employee. But, because I am so good at being a perfectionist, running at high speeds efficiently….I was on a fast track to burn out. The culture at the company was also super toxic. 

When I was 29, my dad died (my last living parent) and to say it gave me perspective would be the least I could say. But also suffered a lot of PTSD from dads death. 

When I was 30, I got pregnant. My husband and I were so happy and subconsciously I think I was so looking forward from a break from all the work and grief. But, as we all know…bringing a new human into the world isn’t a “break”.

I went on maternity leave, met my beautiful daughter and decided I couldn’t leave her to go back to working myself to death. So, I quit my job. Threw everything into being a mom. Remember I said I’m a perfectionist and go at hyper speed?

Well, its amazing being a sahm and then I got pregnant with my second and I think everything caught up with me. I was exhausted, burnt out completely. 

My second child is 2 years old now and he is in a Mother’s Day out program which is lovely. It’s been 6 years since I worked and I keep thinking that I want to go back to work but I’m almost terrified to get back into Marketing at the level I was because Marketing departments (I’ve been around) are seriously taken for granted. Understaffed, resource starved and expected to do everything for every department in a moments notice. 

I want to be around people again, I want a paycheck but I also want energy for my family life. I can’t wrap my head around navigating summer breaks, winter breaks, illnesses with 2 kids , household maintenance while having a full time job.

Am I sabotaging myself? Is there some job out there that will allow me to be there for my children during the breaks, still have human interaction and some glimmer of “me” time mixed in there. Is remote work the way to go and just forego the in person human interaction part?

We've had our now 11 week old Golden Retriever at home with us for two weeks, and for the most part, he's been great. I'm struggling a bit with the puppy blues, and both me and my partner are exhausted at the moment, but he's making good progress in certain areas which makes things a little better.

He's getting there with the toilet. We've had an accident pretty much every day but the frequency of accidents has significantly lessened and we're getting into a routine with his naps. Sometimes he'll even take himself off to the crate while we're sat trying to settle him.

The biggest problem we're having with him revolves predominantly around his chewing. He's got lots of toys, lots of things like Kongs and food mats etc - but he often gravitates to things like our coffee table, our staircase or even his crate and starts to chew on them - we attempt to redirect onto a chew toy and he'll take it for a few seconds and then revert his attention back to the chewing. Sometimes when we're playing, he'll take his toy over to the general area and settle, before quickly going to chew again - like he's trying to trick us.

I read something about using a house lead to help with the redirecting, however if he's got the house lead on inside he just reverts to chewing that instead. 
I've also tried to divert his attention with kibble or treats and reward when he comes away from the area, but once he's had his reward he'll return and chew again.

The water also tastes pretty bad despite looking perfectly clean. I tested by extracting water from the steam wand and that is perfectly fine, which makes me think that the boiler itself is also fine, but something close to brew head is messing up the taste.

The water used was only good quality bottled water, have done backflushes daily and also just did a more in depth clean with detergent hoping that the smell would go away, but its still there.  
I have removed the shower screen and it's clean, I am unable to spot anything wrong with my eyes.

The problem is one single outlet in my kitchen didn’t come back on. I know it worked before because the coffee grinder has been plugged into it for years.

The outlet is along my kitchen counter, and all of the other counter outlets work. The house is new enough that I expect modern code was followed, so it should be on the same circuit as those other counter outlets. The first of them (closest to the panel) is GFI, which I’ve reset a few times now.

No other outlets in the house are dead.

Any idea what could be going on here? I’m going to replace the GFI outlet to see if that makes a difference.

I think it makes me look bored, uninteresting, plain, common and flat 100%. I don't deny the fact that some people might look average and good suitable with brown eyes but when it comes to myself I just feel so inadequate and dead staring with such undesirable darkness. I guess I inherited the trait from my family (we are all unfortunately Latin) and I'm still thinking it's dull and boring. Perhaps it's just internalized colorism or hidden racism (not intentionally) I have seen media portraying lighter eyes as the standard beauty and I feel they are right about it. From Light brown, Caramel, Amber, Hazel, Green, Blue, Gray and shades between these colors and mixed are richer and creatives unlike dark brown/black. I know eyes also works for the gift of sight which I am grateful for (I suffer from sensitive dry eyes 👀 which avoid me to carry colored contacts unfortunately and if I do, I would feel fake after all) But the rest of it, I think I just feel hatred, discomfort and other emotions that only makes me feel sorry myself and entirely plain. I wish a lighter brown will do the right thing for me, Amber or green etc except the ugly brown-black. I have never had any compliments in person about my eyes color 👁️ since they lack of life and don't even slightly change against the sunlight at ALL. I feel it but I understand honestly. Having Dark Brown hair doesn't help either. My pale skin which at don't complain at least, would do better and hide my eye bags if it wasn't for the extreme darkness of the iris that makes me think enhance my dark circles around my eye area like a zombie. I really wish a lighter shade will harmonize my sight zone bringing down my unpleasant looking sleepy stare when I just focus my dark eyes into something or someone, this honestly makes me extremely unsatisfied, and the fact I have read people start calling them (about the color in general) ""Mocha Dark"" ""Black Coffee"" ""Root Beer"" ""Black Pools"" etc as a way to romantize them makes the whole situation even more inconvenient since it seems like that's just a failed attempt to make somebody feels good while feeling sorry for them about the trait they have, in this case (dark brown eyes) which has nothing especial about at least in my persona (I would trade them any day of the week) unlike warming light brown, bright gold, sweet caramel, candid honey, exotic amber or unique enigmatic green, or piercing striking blue or fascinating silver gray and other blends together that brings the richness that colored eyes are supposed to. I find my combo shade (dark hair and eyes) in many members of my family and that reminds me a part of myself that I deeply reject.

I used to have natural light hair (Light Brown/Dark Blonde) and it was a consolating feeling in relation with the dark eyes (I was born with red hair which makes it even more fantastic) and it saddens me that I have lost forever such great shade. As insane as it sound, I have cried tears of sourness and bitterness when comparing myself with other lucky people owning such great light, vibrant, fantastic and globally exotic shades and can't help but feel envy towards them especially when they get the nice attention and I just become boring and nul. Dark brown hair, dark brown eyes are a terribly boring average combo overall. 

Note: Before I get judged or crashed by, I completely understand disagreement about anything, I'm grateful that I can SEE of course when it comes to health more than anything and try to cope with such ""vain complain"" such as eye color everyday but for ME at least that's fundamental in a beauty matter.

They were absolutely slammed, huge drive thru line, huge store line. Only 4 people working. One making sandwiches, one at drive thru and one making coffee, and one at the register. No one ever came up to the order ahead area, and the register cashier disappeared for a bit. Girl making sandwiches was yelling to the drive thru guy that they’re like 3 employees short that day. 

I couldn’t wait any longer or we’d be late for my daughter’s game, so I had to leave without the order. I requested a refund through the app immediately, but the bot only offered 500 points (my order was $16). I declined and sent a message. A few days later, got an email from corporate that I should hear from the store in 2 days, and if I didn’t, to email them back. I never got a response so I did email them back, that was last Saturday. Tuesday my email asked if I wanted to follow up, so I did. No response. So I started another thing through the app but I’m wondering is there anything else I can do? I just want a refund, I’m not trying to be difficult.

As a teenager, I understand the feeling of desperately wanting someone you can't have. The appeal of the one who keeps slipping away is undeniable. But here's the truth: we often crave the unattainable because we like a challenge. We chase after the guy who doesn't want us back, driven by the need to prove - perhaps to some imaginary external force - that we're irresistible enough to change his mind.

In this whirlwind of emotions, we unknowingly attach our self-worth to this person. It's not entirely our fault; our emotions are heightened, and our brains are firing on all cylinders as we navigate the complexities of growing up.
Getting over someone you never even dated can feel like the hardest thing in the world - believe me, I know. But here's something important to realize: you're not in love with him. You're in love with the idea of him, the version of him you've idealized in your mind. You're drawn to the version of him that you believe you could be with - the version you can't have.

And here's the real question: if you can't have that version of him, are you even sure it exists?

This brings me to the first point: the guy you're in love with, the one you cannot have, probably doesn't even exist. He's an idealized version you've created in your head.

Here's the thing - our brains have a tendency to latch onto emotionally charged moments. These memories take center stage, while ordinary, everyday events fade into the background. What's more, our minds often skew these memories toward the positive, conveniently letting the negatives slip away. While this is a natural mechanism to protect us, it can work against us when we're infatuated.

In love, this bias can make us forget or ignore the red flags. We overlook the things he's done that hurt us or the qualities that don't align with what we truly need in a partner. Instead, we focus on the highlights - the charming smile, the fleeting attention, the moments that made your heart race.

But here's the reality: a healthy relationship requires seeing someone fully - flaws and all. Ignoring the negatives only clouds your judgment and leads you to hold onto something that might not be good for you. Well, I guess that's why they say love is blind.
Next, you need to realize that there's far too much love around you to focus solely on someone who isn't willing to look back at you. The word love doesn't have a single definition - we get to love whatever we choose. We love cats, the rain, coffee, and yes, sometimes even the guy we can't have. And that's okay. It's okay to love something or someone unattainable.

What's not okay is wrapping your entire existence around this one person. You can't shut yourself off from the rest of life, feeling broken over this, because what you're truly searching for isn't him - it's love. And the beautiful truth is, there's so much of it around you.

Start noticing the love in the small things. Smile at strangers. Write those letters you'll never send. Treat yourself to something you've been craving. Sleep through a lazy day if you need to. Feel the breeze on your skin and let it remind you of the world's endless beauty. Love is everywhere - you just have to open your heart to it.

I want you to write him a letter. Pour out all your feelings. Tell him how much you love him, how he makes you feel, and everything you've been holding inside. But here's the twist: we're not sending this letter. We're not going to let him come back with the classic ""It's not you, it's me"" or tell us he doesn't feel the same way.
Instead, we're going to reject him.
Yes, you heard that right. How is that supposed to work, you ask? Here's how: in that same letter, I want you to write exactly why you love him - and then tell him exactly why you can't be with him. Because why on earth would you choose to be with someone who, for instance, isn't over their first love or doesn't share your love for chocolate chip ice cream?

I want you to brainstorm every reason why you wouldn't be compatible. Shift the narrative. For too long, you've been stuck imagining why you would be perfect together. It's time to imagine why you wouldn't.

Now, keep that letter close. Every time you catch yourself imagining a life together, take it out and read it. Let it remind you of the reality you've chosen to see - the reasons why it wouldn't work. Not to hurt yourself, but to free yourself.

This letter isn't just a rejection of him; it's a declaration of your own worth. It's a reminder that you deserve someone who chooses you wholeheartedly, without hesitation or excuses. So read it, and let it guide you back to yourself every time you feel lost in the fantasy.
But most importantly, I want to tell you this: it's okay.

It's okay to still love him, even after trying so hard to move on. It's okay to take your time. It's okay to still feel the hurt. It's okay to cry over him while he doesn't even notice. It's okay.

You're human, and it's human nature to love. That's your superpower - the ability to love deeply, even when it's hard, even when it's unreturned. It doesn't matter who the person is; your love is a reflection of your strength, your kindness, and your capacity to feel.

Your love makes you you. And that is something you should never force or suppress.",2,1732211411.0,unrequited_love,3,1.0,False

The water used was only good quality bottled water, have done backflushes daily and also just did a more in depth clean with detergent hoping that the smell would go away, but its still there.  
I have removed the shower screen and it's clean, I am unable to spot anything wrong with my eyes.

I took my first 2.5 auto inject shot last night at 7 PM it is now 9:30 AM. My husband had to give the shot for me because I didn’t know what to expect, it really wasn’t bad at all! and I have to take a seditive to get my blood drawn. There was a tiny drop of blood on my tummy and a tiny drop of medicine leftover on the needle (everything I’ve read is that both is normal).

I started to feel very cold last night (coincidence?) around 9 PM and had to use my heated blanket to stay comfy. 

I woke up this morning very sweaty (not unusual for me to have night sweats though) and did not feel hungry at all (placebo?), but had no problem eating my breakfast/drinking my coffee anyways. 

No rash at my injection site, but my belly stretch marks are mire red than usual? Haven’t seen anything like that mentioned before?

I am tired and wish I was in bed rather than at work, but I’m also recovering from a cold (even had to stay home monday/tuesday) so that could be totally unrelated to the medicine.

It is more difficult for me to p**p than yesterday (aka I feel like I need to but not much is happening), but I naturally have a lot of GI issues and am not super regular anyways.

Discovered Neville about 6 months ago and have been focusing on SC and beliefs and ""small"" things to build my faith (more free coffees, pink cars and other random stuff than I can count) - will post a much longer thing about my SC work in r/NevilleGoddard when it's back because my life has been turned around by these teachings. 

But now to a very specific mini success story that tickled me so I wanted to share.

I got a new car last month. The other day I was making a long distance trip and noticed that during this journey, the mileometer would clock up 1000 miles. It's a silly thing but I was like ""it's my new car's birthday! Wish could take a photo of that."" But I knew that 1000 miles would clock up while I was at high speed on the motorway so I wouldn't get the photo unless the traffic came to a complete stop. I thought ""aww that's a shame, nvm, whatevs"" but enjoyed a brief visualisation of myself in stopped traffic taking a photo of 1000 miles on the dash and felt how satisfying that would be. Then I let it go.

It's a pretty straightforward journey I make a lot and apart from snow on the country roads where I set out it was all smooth. The motorway was busy but moving fluidly throughout the trip, never slower than 60mph. Then suddenly when I was just outside my home city a sign came up on the gantries saying ""accident, slow down"" and the traffic came to a total stop...

At the exact moment my mileometer clocked 999. 

The traffic crawled along stop-start for a couple of minutes, enough distance for it to click over to 1000, and I got my photo.

Then it immediately returned to normal speed. I had a brief thought of ""it's an accident, someone might have got hurt, that's not good"" but it was just a police stop on the hard shoulder, nobody harmed.

I'd post photos but it looks like the function is greyed out on this sub.

I was a young PV2/PFC with the 1st Armored Division, and the joe's with me were near our tanks getting prepared for some field opp. One of the soldiers, named Briggs was going on about conspiracy theories and what not. Briggs was a very interesting individual to say the least. He was a self converted Mormon for starters, and the things this man has done, and even said makes Alex Jones look sane. He also talked with a Mike Tyson type of lisp mixed in with a little sprinkle of the tism if you know what I mean. 

Well, today he is going on a rant about coffee. You see he saw me drinking Starbucks which caused him to go on about the health risks 
of coffee. There are legitimate concerns about consuming too much caffeine as well all should know. From heart issues, bowl issues, anxiety, and sleep cycle. However I've never known coffee to have the capability to turn your stomach into leather. He was absolutely adamant that caffeine especially coffee can and will cause your stomach to turn into leather. In fact he had proof! The Titanic!!! He said that at the bottom of the Titanic, you'll notice leather purses and shoes from where the people have died. However those leather purses aren't purses, in fact they are people's stomachs from all the coffee they drank.

Well today,

So, let me paint you a picture: my adorable, snotty little baby comes home from soft play with what looks like a minor rash and a bit of a fever. ""Oh no,"" I think, ""Poor baby!"" I cuddle him, nurse him back to health, and pat myself on the back for being a great parent.

Fast forward a couple of days—he's back to crawling around, giggling, living his best life like nothing ever happened. Meanwhile, I’m sitting here like I’ve been hit by a truck. Fever? Check. Throat full of ulcers? Check. Hands and feet covered in what feels like tiny volcanoes of pain? Double check.

I googled it, and apparently, adults rarely catch hand, foot, and mouth. Rarely. Well, guess what, folks—I’m the lucky lottery winner. Except instead of cash, I got burning mouth ulcers, itchy hands, and a sudden inability to eat anything spicier than plain rice.

Baby? Thriving. Me? I look like I’ve contracted some kind of medieval plague. My feet hurt so bad I’m hobbling around the house like a pirate with two peg legs, and my hands are so sore I dropped my coffee this morning. TWICE. Best part? as much as I need coffee I can’t have it, IT BURNS MY MOUTH.

And let’s talk about the mouth ulcers. Eating soup? Burns. Drinking water? Burns. Breathing? Somehow also burns. I’m not saying I’d trade my baby for a lifetime of immunity, but… okay, I wouldn’t. But it’d be close.

I’m on day 2/3 I can’t remember.
My head feels like a balloon, my headaches that bad.
The itching in my hand has started but nowhere NEAR as painful as when I’m looking after Bubs and he’s casually SCRAMMING my blisters. On my feet, my hands, MY TONGUE?! 

He stood on my worst toe blister earlier and I thought I saw the light. 
It was time for me to go. 

To all the parents out there who’ve been through this and survived: I salute you. To those who haven’t yet experienced it—consider this your warning. Babies are tiny, adorable germ bombs, and I’ve been outmatched by one.

TL;DR: Baby got hand, foot, and mouth, recovered in 4 days. I caught it, and it’s like Mother Nature is personally roasting me for not washing my hands enough. I’m on day 2/3 and I promise I will not be recovering so quickly 🤪

1gwkz3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gwkz3j/love_triangle_that_isnt_really_a_love_triangle/,"Love triangle that isn’t really a love triangle, how do I navigate this? ","My (F24) bestie and roommate (F21) had introduced me to one of her coworker friends (M29) a couple months back and he was interested in me right away. We got along very well and he started flirting with me and every time we all hung out, he flirted (he seems to flirt with everyone tho? Idk if it’s just his personality or what). 

NOTE: Weeks Prior to him and I meeting, she had shared she had feelings for him, and he ended up shooting her down, she wasn’t his type, was too young for his preferences, and he liked her better as a friend. She was hurt, but agreed that she would rather be friends and they developed that friendship over a couple months before our introduction. 

After a couple weeks of us spending time together, he admitted to my bestie that he had feelings for me and wanted to ask me out. She got really upset, and told him he can’t do that because it’s disrespectful for him to hit on her friends that she introduced him to and that she felt used. Our other friend (F23) also encouraged her to say no. Bestie told me later that I need to stop letting him flirt with me so I said okay. 

Flash forward a couple weeks, we’ve all been hanging out again, started a game with the 3 of us plus two others, so we were together a lot. Eventually, he and I started talking more and more and he was really sweet to me and I have been dealing with a shitty breakup for a couple months, so ngl this was nice to have positive energy from a man in this way. And I could tell by this point that he did like me a bit. Tension had been building because now I’m starting to enjoy talking with him and sharing stories. 

Well, Monday night this week rolls around and I decide to go work on some writing projects at this coffee bar, which happens to be having half price wine all night, so I obviously indulge. My bestie said she couldn’t pick me up after 11 pm, I really was wanting someone to talk to because I was feeling really sad about my breakup (it’s been 3 months but it’s still hard), and didn’t care to spend money on an Uber so I called guy to pick me up. He had no problem doing it, he’d done it for bestie and me before and we’ve done it for him. 

He drove me home, walked me into my apartment and helped me to my room. I, in my drunken mess, kissed him and asked him to lay with me. We laid on my bed for a bit before started making out and things progressed. After a while of going into it, my door swings open and its bestie, and she’s pissed. My gut sank. I felt like such a POS for letting this happen. 

The next day, bestie (thankfully) forgives me and I get a text from guy that my wallet was still in his car, so I had to go get that. She comes with me and tells him they’re done being friends because making a move on me was the one thing she asked him to not do. And that was that. 

But, yesterday, I met up with guy to talk about what happened and see how he’s doing. I felt bad about everything. While we were talking he goes, “you know, I feel like we shouldn’t feel bad for this because this boundary she put up is not considering our feelings at all and we had to push our wants aside to appease her.” And I thought about that and thought about a situation she went through at this same time last year. 

Her situation last year: she was best friends with her ex that was still in love with her, he introduced her to his new friend group from work, and she caught feelings for one his friends and they started hanging out a lot. Eventually, they got into a relationship, and when her ex found out, he flipped sh*t and essentially got everyone in their friend group to hate her and the guy she liked and they were no longer friends. 

So, after thinking about this situation that seems almost the exact same, I am rethinking on if I should feel guilty or not. And I’m thinking, is her “boundary” of telling us that we can’t have romantic feelings for each other crossing a line? Is it actually reasonable, or is it because of her unresolved feelings towards him? Or am I still a bad friend because she had feelings for him recently (despite the fact that he rejected this advance and she agreed to be platonic only) and I made a move? 

Obviously if it comes down to her or him, I’m going to pick her, she’s my best friend. But will this be something I’ll need to be worried about in the future? A lot of the male friends she’s brought around me end up having a crush or something, and she’s been upset about that too. I don’t flirt with anyone unless I’m interested, I’m just nice, polite, and will listen. She said she now doesn’t trust me around men in her life, which I understand, but still sucks. 

I guess just any advice on how to navigate this situation? Are her boundaries valid, or was it too far? Am I bad person for catching feelings for this guy and then acting on them even though I knew how she felt in the past? A lot of other things have happened, too, that she was more involved with that’s led to some fallout recently, but not quite relevant to this post.

But as i pass certain point of time in my study sessions in night my brain just shuts itself,my body feels like that it doesn't have any energy to even  read and speak  what i have just wrote on my notebook.... Eyes starts to feel heavy and i fall asleep even after consuming so much coffee and then i wake up after 3-5 hours of sleep  and after that i couldn't sleep for the whole day no matter how hard i try ... Because of that i couldn't focus for the whole day and expend my day feeling like a zombie....
 Is there any way that i can stay awake for straight 30-34 hours and can still study with an acceptable attention and productivity or this is not possible in the first place.

Are there any tips that i can maintain my focus and energy in night and tackle these  feelings of brain fog. (I know there will be side effects of less sleep on my health but it's what it is)

Tldr; Any tips to maintain productivity and acceptable focus in all nighters while tackling the natural feeling of sleepiness and brain shutdowns.

Had some major stressors this year and my A1C shot up from 6.2 to 8 within a few months. I am slightly overweight at 195lbs/ 6 ft/ 33"" waist, with much of my bodyweight from weekly strength training and sports. I can drop 5-10lbs to get more fit. I usually do Keto coffee in morning for a few months based on my nutritional needs, but have never followed a full Keto diet.

My primary goal is to get my A1C under 5.6 and get off Metformin. As part of my job related benefits, I am getting fully covered access to both Virta and Livongo. To keep it simple, I want to try only 1 of them for the time being. This will help me focus on a single strategy to improve my outcomes. Along with my regular PCP, I also plan on engaging a Diabetic specialist to see if they can help.

I have used Livongo in the past, and they provided a glucose monitor, supplies and access to a coach as needed. It gave me an idea of where my morning fasting sugar was and how to go about the day. Other than 1-2 major spikes when a coach reached out, there wasn't any spam. I mostly used the service to track and trend my fasting sugar and keep some accountability for myself. I could and should have used some of the additional services they provide.

Virta seems to be similar, except they also provide a scale and some supplements as well? They seem to focus on using the app to track Ketones and use food strategy to keep you in Ketosis. The main strategy seems to be weight loss and getting off prescription meds. I don't think I will lose more than 10-15 lbs max. 

Since weight is not a major factor, I am trying to figure out which would work better for me. Anyone in similar situation had experience with both and can provide some insight to help me make an decision?",1,1732210281.0,diabetes,1,1.0,False

We're both second years (undergrad and masters respectively) but never crossed paths more than knowing of each other. He joined me and my friends table at this event since he vaguely knew some of us and we got to talking. The day after this one friend did ask me if Jon was someone I was seeing since he had never met him, and I said no (this is important later).

Jon later texted me thanking me for letting him sit with us, acknowleding that he is older than us but also that most of the people on his course are in their 50s so it's hard to bond with them. So I didnt bat an eye when he asked to go for coffee, figuring it was just a way to get to know me.

Over the weekend we also found out we had a few mutual friends from outside of uni and were both attending an event they were hosting. We both met up there and had drinks, and I noticed the whole time he was putting his arm around me, but I didnt think much of it. He also asked me what my friends thought of him and I recounted the story from earlier of a friend asking if he was someone I was seeing and that conversation went like this

Me: My friend asked if you were someone I was seeing
Jon: And what did you say?
Me, scoffing: No, obviously
Jon makes a face
Me: haha was I meant to say yes or something?
Jon laughs and shrugs

Now I'm thinking that him asking me for coffee might have been him asking me on a date, and I said yes without thinking! We had arranged it for Friday which is tomorrow, and I don't know how to feel. He's cool and I want to get to know him as a friend (which I thought this coffee thing was for) but he's too old for me and I don't see any appeal in dating him. I'm hoping this is just me reading into it too much but im gonna play it as cool as possible and act as platonic as I can, especially considering he has not once said the word date when asking to get me coffee. Wish me luck I guess?

Napaisip ako kung paano gumastos, mag-ipon, at kumayod nang mas maayos. Natutunan ko rin na minsan, yung simple skills at boring na trabaho, sila pala yung malaking kitaan. Eto mga napulot ko, para hindi mo na pagdaanan.

* **Inflation is Everywhere** (Even in Your Timplado Coffee). It’s not just the grocery bills - 2024 showed me inflation is a sneaky little thief. Yung Andok's Dokito Burger na dati ₱70 lang, aba ₱100 na ngayon! It got so bad, even my favorite fast food “cheat meals” started feeling premium. I had to track everything—from Shopee add-to-cart moments to random late-night snacks - kasi bigla nalang ako nagugulat na paubos na pala ang budget ko for the month.
* **Procrastination is the Real Wallet Killer** \- Ayan, I learned this the hard way. Naalala ko yung sirang aircon namin—akala ko kaya pa, so deadma muna. Two weeks later, it fully gave up... during a heatwave. Napilitang bumili ng bago on the spot sa mahal na. That’s when I realized, yung ""later"" na iniisip mo, mas nagiging expensive now. Whether it’s overdue bills or investments you’re delaying, mas mahal ang epekto in the long run.
* **Learning Skills is the New Emergency Fund** \- 2024 humbled me. I realized savings lang aren’t enough when life hits you hard. Kaya natutunan ko na mag-side gig sa business ng kapatid ko tuwing weekends, para at least may backup ako. A friend of mine learned how to install solar panels para maging freelance installer. It doesn’t have to be complicated, pero having a new skill gives you options - and options are everything when the bills come knocking.
* **Cheap Stuff Ends Up More Expensive** \- Okay, confession: I bought this unknown brand laptop from Shopee kasi gusto ko makatipid. Three months later, sira na. Napilitang bumili ng mas reliable na unit, so doble pa ang nagastos ko. Lesson learned? Not everything na “mura” is worth it. Shoes, gadgets, even home appliances - if you go for quality upfront, you’ll save yourself the headache and surprise gastos.
* **Who You Know is Your Secret Weapon** \-  One casual convo with a friend ended up doubling my income this year. They recommended me for a freelance gig that I didn’t even think I could do! 2024 reminded me na networking isn’t just for big-shot businessmen. It’s about staying open, building connections, and being helpful to people—you never know where it can take you.

**Bonus Tip**

Napansin ko rin na yung mga seemingly ""boring"" professions, malaki pala ang kita. Yung pinsan ko na HVAC technician (yung nag-aayos ng aircon at ref), kumikita ng ₱30,000-₱50,000 sa freelance work para sa mga restaurants. Doon ko lang nalaman na in-demand pala and may shortage tayo ng HVAC technicians. Sometimes, the less glamorous jobs are the ones that pay well.",31,1732209771.0,phinvest,3,0.94,False

Givenchy L'interdit Rouge - This one was a free sample, I wouldn't have picked it up seeing the notes but it was love at first sniff for me and the drydown was just gorgeous! It starts with juicy fruity notes, gets a little floral and dries down to a beautiful sandalwood. Converted in a full size 🫶
Burberry Her Elixir - Beautiful juicy strawberry milkshake as everyone says 🫶 Quite linear in my opinion but such a comforting scent. Wearing it often these days. Need a full bottle but toooo expensive so I have a 10ml decant now.
NR Fleur Musc EDT : I think I just love rose fragrances. The ones that are more juicy and jammy (not the lancome rose 😭) I ordered the EDT instead of EDP by mistake. It starts with a beautiful rose and soon it becomes a bit spicy. However the rose shines linearly with a little bit of musc Ended up buying the EDP bottle (after reading a lot of reviews comparing the edt & edp) and I love it more, it is not as spicy.
Akro Dark : Sprayed it just once and all I get is weird incense and tobacco. Don't have the will to try it again 👎
Montale Ristretto intense cafe : I already had a decant of intense cafe, though I don't get any coffee from it, I like it as a rose dominant fragrance which has got me a few compliments. Ristretto is not much different, I get a coffee note for a minute and two and then it is exactly similar to the OG. Not getting a full bottle because I have a 10ml decant for Intense Cafe.
PDM Oriana : Starts off with such juicy fruity notes, I mostly get berries. Then it shifts to citrusy notes. The drydown is creamy,citrusy and fruity
PDM Delina La Rosee : A very generic rose fragrance for me. I don't get anything other than rose and it is not a kind of rose I like. A pass for me!
PDM Delina Exclusif : This one is wow. This has nice kind of fresh juicy roses and a certain sweetness that I cannot pinpoint comes from where! I definitely want a bigger size, anyone wanting to declutter their partials, let me know!
MFK Gentle Fluidity Gold : Starts off with a strong fennel seed scent (?) and then there is a boozy sort of fragrance that comes in for me. After thinking a lot, I realised it smells a lot like kayali Vanilla 28 (which is a recent purchase, I did not like it much and kept for it to mature) Decent one but I don't need a bigger bottle for sure!",6,1732209588.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,1.0,False

I guess bland college dining hall food made me venture out? Maybe age?                  

Cheese- I could do pizza, cheese burgers, mozz sticks and only boxed mac n cheese. Cheese on eggs was a no no, now I love that. Now If there's a cheese and crackers board, I'll grab some. I used to be particular about brands but now I just love cheese! Heck now I prefer chicken alfredo over my long beloved spaghetti and meatballs when I go to an Italian restaurant.  Although, I can't do blue cheese!       

Caramel- Growing up I couldn't do plain caramels. Caramel had to be with something like chocolate and nougat or coffee or with apples. Now I'll just eat it plain. I love those dark chocolate sea salt caramels from aldi. 

Sour cream- discovered by accident. I only love it in my tacos or burritos. 

Mayonnaise- Before then I could only do mayo in potato salad. Now I love it in sandwiches and salads.  

Eggs- I was a scrambled eggs only with ketchup kind of person until I turned 20. Now I love deviled eggs, egg salad, sausage, egg and cheese sandwiches. I also love omelets now  bring on all the meats, cheeses and veggies!                                   ",2,1732209390.0,autism,2,1.0,False

1gwkj9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1gwkj9g/keeping_battlefield_fun_by_kicking_toxic_players/,Keeping Battlefield Fun by Kicking Toxic Players,"Hi Reddit, your favorite admin is back on here for a short time.

I just wanted to share a little story about why I LOVE being the owner of the best Battlefield 4 servers, Skills and Kills. Every day, I’m reminded of how important my role is in keeping them free of toxicity and sweats.

You see, when I hop into spectator mode, I’m not just here to watch, I’m here to monitor and in turn I can curate an experience for all 64 players. Sometimes that means making calls like kicking that sweaty tryhard who keeps obliterating everyone in a tank or the dude who clearly has no life and sits on the top of the leaderboard round after round with 30 kills and 2 deaths. Balance is key. If you’re too good, that’s unfair for the rest of the players. I had to kick a few people several times last night because they thought they could farm my server out.

And the rage messages. Every time I see a message pop up that says, “Why did you kick me? I wasn’t cheating!” or “You’re just mad because I killed you” it fuels me. I sip my coffee and laugh, knowing I’m keeping the game fun for the whole server. These people don’t understand that the server belongs to me, and what I say goes. Don’t like it? Find another server. Good luck with that. Mine are the only consistently full servers anyway

To all the haters: Keep those angry messages coming. They’re honestly the highlight of my day. If anything, they confirm I’m doing my job right. And to everyone else? You’re welcome for the quality experience I’m providing and will continue to provide for the great community that I have built.

Stay balanced out there,

Not great at explaining fragrances or identifying different notes, so consider it noob language.

1. Givenchy L'interdit Rouge - This one was a free sample, I wouldn't have picked it up seeing the notes but it was love at first sniff for me and the drydown was just gorgeous! It starts with juicy fruity notes, gets a little floral and dries down to a beautiful sandalwood. 
Converted in a full size 🫶

2. Burberry Her Elixir - Beautiful juicy strawberry milkshake as everyone says 🫶 Quite linear in my opinion but such a comforting scent. Wearing it often these days. 
Need a full bottle but toooo expensive so I have a 10ml decant now.

3. NR Fleur Musc EDT : I think I just love rose fragrances. The ones that are more juicy and jammy (not the lancome rose 😭) I ordered the EDT instead of EDP by mistake. It starts with a beautiful rose and soon it becomes a bit spicy. However the rose shines linearly with a little bit of musc
Ended up buying the EDP bottle (after reading a lot of reviews comparing the edt & edp) and I love it more, it is not as spicy.

4. Akro Dark : Sprayed it just once and all I get is weird incense and tobacco. Don't have the will to try it again 👎

5. Montale Ristretto intense cafe : I already had a decant of intense cafe, though I don't get any coffee from it, I like it as a rose dominant fragrance which has got me a few compliments. Ristretto is not much different, I get a coffee note for a minute and two and then it is exactly similar to the OG. 
Not getting a full bottle because I have a 10ml decant for Intense Cafe.

6. PDM Oriana : Starts off with such juicy fruity notes, I mostly get berries. Then it shifts to citrusy notes. The drydown is creamy,citrusy and fruity 

7. PDM Delina La Rosee : A very generic rose fragrance for me. I don't get anything other than rose and it is not a kind of rose I like. A pass for me!

8. PDM Delina Exclusif : This one is wow. This has nice kind of fresh juicy roses and a certain sweetness that I cannot pinpoint comes from where!
I definitely want a bigger size, anyone wanting to declutter their partials, let me know!

9. MFK Gentle Fluidity Gold : Starts off with a strong fennel seed scent (?) and then there is a boozy sort of fragrance that comes in for me. After thinking a lot, I realised it smells a lot like kayali Vanilla 28 (which is a recent purchase, I did not like it much and kept for it to mature)
Decent one but I don't need a bigger bottle for sure! ",1,1732209327.0,desifemfrag,1,1.0,False

1gwkequ,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1gwkequ/an_interaction_made_me_uncomfortable_i_was/,"An interaction made me uncomfortable. I was wondering whether it was warranted or part of CPTSD, then I worried that what if I'm subconsciously transphobic without realising and that's why I felt funny","(TLDR at the bottom)

I (17yr-old cis lesbian for context) worried I was transphobic earlier. I know that's not true, transphobia infuriates me, I've seen the damage it can do to the trans people I really care about. But after feeling not okay in an encounter with someone, either a feminine dressing man/non-binary person, or a trans woman, the thought crossed my mind that maybe the whole ridiculous 'trans woman are preditors' narrative had somehow wormed its way into my head?

I've had cis men but actually more times cis women touch or talk to me in an unwanted inappropriate way, or make me do things I don't want to do etc. I have never had any issues like that with any of the trans or non-binary people I know, so usually I feel more safe in their presence than in the presence of cis men and woman. I'm probably most cautious around women, so I think if there was any prejudice it was more towards the woman bit of trans woman than the trans bit I think

I had been walking around in the freezing cold for a few hours and because of the cold combined with a lack of sleep combined with the fact all I'd eaten in twenty four hours was three spoonfuls of porridge and a little bit of chocolate, I was pretty dizzy and out of it. I then went to buy a coffee and was told I didn't have enough money, and I said it was usually only £3.80, and the batista got really annoyed with me. Someone else served me for the correct price (£3.80, I was right), but I don't do well with conflict so on top of being dizzy, freezing and out of it I was now slightly freaked out

(Yes, I am playing the tiniest violin ever lol)

I missed my train (🎻🎻🎻) and there was another train to where I live that left in half an hour waiting on the tracks. I was getting on when a train station worker shouted ""Hey!"" at me (the maybe trans woman, they might not have even been a trans woman, I know I shouldn't presume. Since they didn't have a pronoun badge I'll just use they/them)

I turned round thinking I'd done something wrong, and they ran towards me. I asked if I was allowed on yet. They said yes I was certainly allowed on, and they were joking around with me and I was trying to joke back. Then they followed me onto the train (they'd previously been emptying bins on the tracks so were presumably supposed to be doing a job outside the train) and we carried on chatting, but given we were the only ones on the train and they didn't seem to be leaving as I took my seat, in fact they were moving closer, I started to feel very mildly uncomfortable. They weren't doing anything wrong so I don't know why, something just felt off. I mentioned it was cold and they asked me where I was going, because it was snowing up North. I said the vague area I lived in but not my town, and then because their face was saying maybe they'd picked up on the fact I didn't want to say which stop I was getting off at, I moved on quickly to saying I had family up North and it was snowing loads there. We talked for a few more minutes about the weather and then out of nowhere they asked me again where I was going. I hesitated and they started listing towns, so I told them. Then they nodded and said it was nice to talk to me, but they didn't get off the train, just walked down to the next carriage

I'm still on the train but there's a decent amount of people on now. I think I was paranoid because of CPTSD added to low blood sugar added to the cold added to sleep deprivation added to the fact I always feel anxious going home. Hence the fact I was walking around in the freezing cold for ages

TLDR: A worker at a train station shouted hey and me and ran over, followed me onto an empty train, and kept asking where I lived while we were chatting. Something about it felt sort of wrong, but I can't identify anything in particular that creeped me out. Afterwards it crossed my mind that their appearance suggested they were maybe a trans woman, and I worried that my discomfort with the interaction came from subconscious transphobia

I managed to wedge my WWS between 2 rocks, hopelessly stuck. Winching every which way did nothing. 

I had a Twinsteer nearby, so I brought that over to help. Winching with that still did nothing, but I was able to winch it over/around the WWS, winch the tanker out of the way, and repeatedly ram the Twinsteer into the WWS until it freed up. Lots of switching and winching was involved, nearly flipped the Twinsteer multiple times, and both trucks ran out of gas. Fortunately I was recovering a fuel tanker, so that didn’t matter lol. I did eventually pop it out of the rock wedgie, winched the trailer over the rocks, and sold the tanker.

I (17yr-old cis lesbian for context) worried I was transphobic earlier. I know that's not true, transphobia infuriates me, I've seen the damage it can do to the trans people I really care about. But after feeling not okay in an encounter with someone, either a feminine dressing man/non-binary person, or a trans woman, the thought crossed my mind that maybe the whole ridiculous 'trans woman are preditors' narrative had somehow wormed its way into my head?

I've had cis men but actually more times cis women touch or talk to me in an unwanted inappropriate way, or make me do things I don't want to do etc. I have never had any issues like that with any of the trans or non-binary people I know, so usually I feel more safe in their presence than in the presence of cis men and woman. I'm probably most cautious around women, so I think if there was any prejudice it was more towards the woman bit of trans woman than the trans bit

I had been walking around in the freezing cold for a few hours and because of the cold combined with a lack of sleep combined with the fact all I'd eaten in twenty four hours was three spoonfuls of porridge and a little bit of chocolate, I was pretty dizzy and out of it. I then went to buy a coffee and was told I didn't have enough money, and I said it was usually only £3.80, and the batista got really annoyed with me. Someone else served me for the correct price, but I don't do well with conflict so on top of being dizzy, freezing and out of it I was now slightly freaked out

(Yes, I am playing the tiniest violin ever lol)

I missed my train (🎻🎻🎻) and there was another train to where I live that left in half an hour waiting on the tracks. I was getting on when a train station worker shouted ""Hey!"" at me (the maybe trans woman, they might not have even been a trans woman, I know I shouldn't presume stuff)

I turned round thinking I'd done something wrong and they ran towards me and I asked if I was allowed on yet. They said yes I was certainly allowed on, and they were joking around with me and I was trying to joke back. Then they followed me onto the train (they'd previously been emptying bins on the tracks so we're presumably supposed to be doing a job outside the train) and we carried on chatting, but given we were the only ones on the train and they didn't seem to be leaving as I took my seat, in fact they were moving closer, I started to feel very mildly uncomfortable. They weren't doing anything wrong so I don't know why, something just felt off. I mentioned it was cold and they asked me where I was going, because it was snowing up North. I said the vague area I lived in but not my town, and then because their face was saying maybe they'd picked up on the fact I didn't want to say which stop I was getting off at, I moved on quickly to saying I had family up North and it was snowing loads there. We talked for a few more minutes about the weather and then out of nowhere they asked me again where I was going. I hesitated and they started listing towns, so I told them. Then they nodded and said it was nice to talk to me, but they didn't get off the train, just wondered down to the next carriage

I'm still on the train but there's a decent amount of people on now. I think I was paranoid because of CPTSD added to low blood sugar added to the cold added to sleep deprivation added to the fact I always feel anxious going home. Hence the fact I was walking around in the freezing cold for ages

TLDR: A worker at a train station shouted hey and me and ran over, followed me onto an empty train, and kept asking where I lived while we were chatting. Something about it felt sort of wrong, but I can't identify anything in particular that creeped me out. Afterwards it crossed my mind that their appearance suggested they were maybe a trans woman, and I worried that my discomfort with the interaction came from subconscious transphobia",7,1732208719.0,OCD,3,1.0,False

I've been GMing for years, and decades ago I wrote RPGs professionally (with a million words or so commissioned by Chaosium, Palladium, White Wolf, etc.) But however much I've fallen in love with one system or another at different times, I've always found it handy to have a super-lightweight set of rules available that I can use for quick, low-prep one-shots - for times when friends want me to run something, and all I have is an idea and a couple of lines scribbled on a piece of paper.

For others who might want to dive into running a game without getting bogged down in stat-blocks and mechanics and drawn out character generation, this is LITE-RPG.

Characters can be created in just a few minutes, without any stats or numbers.

The whole ""system"" is just four pages long, and the suggested Pay What You Want price is about the same as a cup of coffee.

So I’m gonna try to make this as short as possible. I just returned to school as a 24F. I’ll be graduating in 1.5 more semesters so I’m a senior. I took a class on gender studies and it was geared more towards women studies/feminist movement which I loved. Prior to taking the class I’ve always been pretty informed on feminism and world issues, BUT the class has deepened my interest. My first class i remember seeing this girl and I just admired her beauty/style. I didn’t think much of it and went on about my day. Next day I go to recitation and guess who the teaching assistant is? Yes, it’s the girl that caught my eye the day prior. So now there’s that power dynamic which complicates things. She’s a student but she’s a PhD student and once the semester ends the power dynamic also ends. I have hardly spoken to her, but the few times we have I have just felt there’s chemistry we both recognize. She is super GAY to clarify and single but I’m 24 and she’s 30. I specifically remember one day in class I looked up to find her staring at me. I got so nervous I broke eye contact, looked away, looked back and she was still staring and then smiled at me almost flirtatiously. I had a lesbian panic attack. That’s when I really started to think there’s chemistry. But then I’m like am I overthinking? What if it was just a smile? I went to an event for extra credit and I was the only one in the class to go out of 100+ students. She showed up late and sat right behind me. When the event ended I turned around and locked eyes with her. She said “I’m so glad you were able to make it.” She makes me so nervous.. we exchanged a few words and I rushed out. I have an A in the class and overall I am a good student (3.8gpa). I will be applying for masters programs at the same Uni so I need advice on how to navigate this from my fellow gays.
 
To add we have very similar interests such as loving drag, anything pro-women, views on world issues, politics, attend the same uni…more 
SO…

**I think I am gonna go with option 3 or 4 but you guys probably have better advice. I don’t flirt with girls ever**

**Semester ends in 18 days and I have only two classes left with her therefore:**

1) do I approach her next class and try to strike up a conversation with her just to talk a bit before the semester ends? It would be a regular conversation no flirting

2) on the very last day of class should I try to strike up a quick conversation and then respectfully ask if she’s okay with exchanging instagrams

3) should I not say anything at all on the last day of class and about 2 weeks after class ends should I send a short email expressing my interests in gen studies and ask to meet up for coffee (if she’d like) to discuss navigating master programs and academics. I’d also throw in that I’m very fond of her. She’s gay. I’m gay. She’ll catch on. 

4) Strike up a conversation with her on the last day of classes just to establish a friendship. Ask for her instagram on the last day of class because I am graduating soon and would like to stay in touch. Then 2 weeks after semester ends send her a brief email/message asking to get coffee?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this long post and offer any insight or advice. I know TBI’s cause lifelong sleep disturbances for some people. Turns out I’m one of them.
 
I’m three years post-accident. Moderate TBI caused by multiple successive concussions. I did intensive neurorehab including SLP, OT, PT, VT, and neuropsychiatric therapy. About 18 months ago I started staying up all night and my sleep quality overall suffered. I saw a specialist, followed all recommended behavioral changes to improve sleep hygiene, and for over a year worked with my psychiatrist to manage my insomnia with medication. I meditate, exercise, consume only a single cup of coffee a day, and am otherwise fairly able to cope with the deficits we all experience after a devastating disability.
 
I’ve tried every “natural” remedy including high dose melatonin, valerian, and peptide therapy with no success. I had insomnia before my accident, but it was manageable with medications such as trazodone or mirtazapine. I’ve tried old medications at high doses such as 600 mg of trazadone and it doesn’t work. I really wanted to avoid controlled substances that are habit forming but after trying trazodone, melatonin, olanzapine, pramipexole, Haldol, Buspar, Mirapex, Seroquel, Saphris, Rozerem, gabapentin, and a few others that I can’t remember, and ran out of options.
 
Six months ago, I started seeing a neurologist who specializes in sleep disorders and started keeping a detailed sleep diary, did a sleep study, did CBT-I, sleep restriction therapy, and have tried Belsomra and Lunesta at the maximum dose with minimal improvement. Basically, every single week I stay up for anywhere from 2-3 nights a week. I don’t just sleep poorly, I don’t sleep at all. When I do sleep my sleep is highly disrupted and I average 4 hours of sleep per night.
 
I already struggle with fatigue but I am struggling with a level of exhaustion that I don’t have words to describe. The severity of my insomnia post-TBI and the fact that it resists treatment and is so relentless feels like torture. It has caused my physical and mental health to decline in ways that are terrifying. I don’t just feel like I’m at the end of my rope, I feel like I passed that point months ago. I can barely function, am plagued by suicidal thoughts, and am truly at a loss for how I can manage to continue living with severe sleep deprivation. I would appreciate any suggestions or advice from the tribe.",2,1732208032.0,TBI,7,1.0,False

I have to admit I’m at the start of a journey here, and I’m not totally sure this is the right subreddit. So, please bear with me and have patience if this isn’t the right audience!

I am finally trying to square up against my lifelong nemesis, “first meal” aka breakfast, the alleged “most important meal of the day.”

So here’s the issue — I don’t eat breakfast. Plain and simple. I’ll get into the “why” as I can understand it, and what I do in the mornings, and what I’ve tried so far to shift this…

I wake up, make coffee, put a scoop of collagen protein powder and half and half into a mug with some coconut sugar, add the coffee, drink it. This is at like 8:30 am. It’s the first thing I do every morning. Well, maybe second, since I’m also in the bad habit of checking instagram when I roll over and turn my alarm off. Yikes, I know.

Then I do pretty much whatever. I’m not working right now so truly my morning routine could be whatever I wanted it to be! But I don’t shift it. I’m grieving the loss of my mother and father. So maybe that’s why I’m a lump, idk.

So I’ll have coffee then play video games or tidy up and then all of a sudden it’s 11:30 am and I’m STARVING. Like too hungry to cook because I’m so hungry I feel sick. It’s like I go from 0 (no appetite) to 100 (so hungry I’m ill). Then I have to stop, order food to be delivered, and feel shame about it until it gets here.

I tried rebranding breakfast into first meal to shift my mindset around what types of foods were acceptable for me to eat first thing. That didn’t help a lick!

The one exception to this pattern is if I have a morning appointment (usually physical therapy, 9 am) which means I’ll shower first thing, then grab a protein coffee (canned) and an uncrustables pb&j (premade) and take them with me out the door. This is the only time I manage to “eat breakfast.”

Does anyone have any advice about what I can do to shift this pattern? I feel really lost and stumped, and defeated. ",1,1732207813.0,NutritionalPsychiatry,0,1.0,False
1gwjuth,https://www.reddit.com/r/allstringed/comments/1gwjuth/unlocking_the_sonic_secrets_of_guitar_preamps/,🎸 Unlocking the Sonic Secrets of Guitar Preamps! 🎛️,"Hey there, fellow six-string slingers! 🐦 Ever felt like you need a PhD in electronics just to understand guitar preamps? Fear not! Let’s break it down in a way even your cat could understand! 😸

### What’s a Guitar Preamplifier? 
In simple terms, a preamp takes your guitar's weak signal and cranks it up to 11 (okay, maybe not that much, but close)! It's the magic box that shapes your tone, adding effects, boosting volume, and even making you sound like a rock god. 

### Why Should You Care? 
Because:
1. **Boost Your Signal** 🚀: It fights signal loss from long cables and gives your sound a nice kick!  
2. **Add Effects** 🎶: Some preamps let you dial in built-in effects, or connect your fave pedals for that extra *spice*.  
3. **Enhance Your Tone** 🎚️: Shape your sound! Want fat bass or sparkling treble? You got it!  
4. **Equalize Like a Boss** 🔊: EQ controls let you sculpt your sound so it’s not just good, it’s *perfect* (or at least a few tweaks away).  
5. **Refine the Signal** 🔧: Impedance matching makes sure your signal stays clean, giving it that polished studio sound.  

### Types of Preamps:
- **Tube Preamps**: Warm and creamy like a good cup of coffee. ☕️
- **Solid-State Preamps**: Reliable and clean; the dependable friend in your musical journey.
- **Digital Modeling Preamps**: The Swiss Army knife! Access to an arsenal of sounds and effects. 🚀
- **Hybrid Preamps**: The love child of analog warmth and digital precision. 

### Using a Preamplifier:
- **Connect** it to your amp. Don’t ask why, just trust me. 
- **Adjust Settings**: Play with gain, bass, mid, treble, and more until your sound is fire! 🔥
- **Record or Perform**: Look like a pro while you make sweet music! 

### Benefits:
- Amplifies your sound. ✔️
- Gives you tone control. 😎
- Offers versatility. 🌈
- Integrates effects. 🔌
- Provides consistency across all gigs! 🎤

So go forth, brave musicians! Explore the world of preamps, and unlock sonic potentials you didn’t know existed! Your guitar (and ears) will thank you! 🎸💖

My (now ex) boyfriend (23M) and I (23NB) were long distance dating for a year and a half. He worked at a thrift store. He came home one day and said that a girl had come in and asked to get coffee with him. I asked how he knew her and he said she was pretty much a stranger. He said she would come into his work a few times and they would talk when he'd ring up her clothes. I told him it sounded like she was asking him on a date and he reassured me that she knew about us and knew he was taken. I had even double checked that she knew he was taken a few days before they were supposed to get coffee and he said yes.

The day comes and he tells me he'll be gone for about two hours. It was my day off so I thought we could spend time together after they got coffee. I was busy doing something when I realized it had been over two hours so I sent him a text. I didn't get a response after an hour but I did get a snapchat from him. All it was was a picture of a field and him commenting on how pretty it was. I decided to call him because I got worried. He answered but wouldn't talk to me. I kept asking him if he was okay and where he was but he just goes ""huh? yea I need to go"".

Five hours go by and he still hasn't texted me back or called me. I'm starting to get really worried at this point. He finally calls me back and I ask him what's going on. He tells me that they went to coffee and decided to walk around the town for a bit. Then they decided to go to an arcade. I got extremely furious because that sounds extremely like a date and he was ignoring me the whole time. He started gaslighting me and saying I was overreacting, then got mad at me and hung up.

I tried to let it go but a few months go by and he got a new apartment. He told me that that girl had invited herself over and they were going to hang out and play games. I told him, again, that this sounded like a date and that I was uncomfortable with him having a girl over. He brushed me off and she came over. I then forced him to let me talk to her and we did. I didn't say much of anything but just a general greeting and asked what their plans were. That was that.

Another few months go by and he tells me that she wants him to help her move. She apparently had a storage unit with her stuff and needed help taking it to her apartment. I asked for more information and he said he didn't know. She never said when it was happening or anything. A month or so goes by and I didn't hear anything about it again so I asked him and he said she never reached out.

I've been eyeing an espresso machine for a while now, and with my recent shift to working from home full-time, it feels like the perfect time to invest in one (without going overboard). Since I'm home most of the day, having access to quality coffee has become a must for me.

Right now, I only have a French press, which does the job, but making just 1-2 cups in the morning and then having to clean it all over again for a second cup later is getting a bit tedious. I'm looking for something simple but capable—something I can put a little love into to brew a really great cup of coffee.

I typically drink black coffee, Americano, or espresso. Occasionally, I make iced lattes for my girlfriend as well.

I've been browsing espresso machines, checking out November deals, and reading reviews both here and elsewhere. It’s turning out to be a bit more of a challenge than I expected to find something I like. Initially, I thought I could just get a machine with a built-in grinder, but after seeing a lot of recommendations here, it seems like it's better to have a separate grinder. Totally fine with that—I just want to know what options are good quality at this price point.

My budget is between 200-400 Euros. Does anyone have any recommendations for a solid espresso machine and grinder combo (or separate units) that would fit within this range?

It's been a few days and we haven't heard from them since, but have heard from some of our mutual friends that they have been telling everybody that we told them they were lazy and distracting, that we were blaming them for not doing well in our exams and that they had no future or prospects if they couldn't sit down and study (this is not true). Tallulah and Evie both think that we should apologise to them so that we can move past it as a group, but I really don't believe that we were in the wrong, and spreading lies and exaggerations about the argument made me less willing to apologise.

Dear mon coeur,

It has been a while since we talk, not exactly a while if we count the little chat that we exchanged now and then. But it has been a while, maybe 6 months since we have a real conversation, like the lasting for hours’ phone call.

So anyway, how are you? Like really, how are you? Maybe I asked this because I just really want to hear you voice, to listen to you talk about your day-to-day life. I miss the way you describe the weather, the people your meet, your work, your daily things that happens to you. All of these little things that make up your day always make me fascinated. I really love the ways you see the life, especially in the way you see the good part in every person, including me.

You know, since you left, I’ve felt lonely, despite how many people are around me or even when I’m all alone. I still wish that you were here. I miss you and I admit it, not without a little bit of shame. I won’t hide my feeling like the way you do and I never will. Maybe that why I’m the only person who’s still haunted by the question “Was everything between us true? Was you really mean it when you said “I love you” or was it something you said in the moment?” I really wish everything between us were all just lies, so I can forget it or maybe even hate it. But the pain feels too real, so I guess what we had was real. We had a good time together, didn’t we?

Maybe after all, for you, I’m just an ordinary friend or worse -just a fling you had. But for me, you are my best friend the one who made everything less foreign when I first came here. I could not explain the unspoken bond that we had. Felt like when I look at you, I can see myself as clear as I look at a mirror. Perhaps, as we grew up, we encountered similar things which had shaped us into the person that only us can recognize in each other. Maybe you and I, we are just some sensitives souls, struggling to hold ourselves together in a world often feel harsh and unkind. Thanks to you, I found one more reason to believe in humanity and in the good things that this world could offer.

It’s close to your birthday, if I not recall wrong. I still remember, last years, when you, me and the others plan to go to the bar. You were about to bail out but I had convinced you to stay. And it turned out not really bad. We were talking mostly to each other, barely noticing anyone else. When I look back, I realize, in the crowded atmosphere of the bar, we were falling in love without even realizing that. 
This year everything is different, the city feels strange and cold. And I can’t help myself looking for you a present in the book stores. I still remember that you love the detective story especially the one with the layered mystery. You love reading and I know it. I still have the book that you gave me, the book about a mysterious case of murder. According to you: “I wish that I could forget about this book so I can read it once again. You have to read it and you wont be regret”.

Damn it, you have checked every box for my “girlfriend material”.

However, good things never mean to stay, as us will never stay together. You have your reason and it is a good reason. It not because of you, and it’s not because of me either. It’s just something beyond our reach. Life just gets in the way, and we can’t do nothing, except standing and watching everything fall. I hate the way you were right about everything. Maybe we were just stubborn and listen to our heart instead of our head. Maybe in another timeline, I could have spent my life with you. I could have woken up with you in my arms, talking about books over morning coffee. Is that such a terrible thing to dream of? Even if all the stars in the sky aligned, you and I can’t be together—not even in this lifetime.
I know at the moment, you may have forget about the things in the past and everything is better for you now. And I’m really happy for you. You deserve every best thing in the world.

But still, questions linger in my mind. I know they’re better left unanswered for both our sakes, yet I can’t stop thinking about them. If I could summon all my courage to ask you, I would simply say:

If you know what song the lyric in the title's from then you've already got my approval haha.

Anyway, first time didn't work that well, so here I am again with a shorter post (still have the full one up on my profile).

I'm a 23-year-old currently living in Moscow, originally from Europe. Right now, I'm working remotely in Europe until January, but I'll be back in Moscow afterward. I'm open to relocating within Russia or to Central Europe later on (after I finish my studies).

I'm currently working in IT, but I'm planning to shift gears soon – balancing my studies while getting involved with NGOs. I believe in continuous personal growth and making a positive impact in the world, so I'm exploring ways to support local communities, help children, animals, or those struggling with illnesses (also a bit hard given the cultural and linguistic barrier + political situation). Making a real difference is something I want to be part of, and it would be amazing to meet someone who shares these values.

Hobbies-wise, I love learning about the world and diving into topics that spark my curiosity. I also have a soft spot for great storytelling – whether it's in a movie, song, or game, there's something powerful about those moments that make you see the world differently.

I used to be very active with swimming, water polo, and basketball, though Moscow's weather has me sticking to light running and hiking these days.

Music is a big part of my life too – my playlists jump from Kendrick and Mitski to classics like Coldplay, Arcade Fire, and Tame Impala. I'm always on the lookout for something new to soundtrack my day.

I also love traveling. Just this year, I've been lucky enough to visit cities all across Europe – north to south, west to east. Paris, Milan, Berlin – you name it.

As for what I'm looking for:

- Someone under 30, with no kids but open to having them in the future.

- Honesty, emotional availability, and kindness are non-negotiables.

- Good communicator - whether as friends or partners, let's talk about whatever issue arises and try to work through it and be there for each other.

- Someone who's passionate about growth, self-improvement, and making an impact.

- Ideally, you're nearby – maybe even in Moscow – and open to meeting up. Whether it's for coffee, a walk, or grabbing a bite, I'd love to connect in person instead of endless back-and-forth texts. If not here, then at least in Central/Eastern Europe as I also spend a lot of time there - or I did until now.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

P.S. I'd prefer to avoid political discussions or getting into personal details like my move for now – let's focus on getting to know each other!",0,1732206943.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.33,False
1gwjfxt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gwjfxt,"63-66/52: female rage, murder & a sprinkle of cozy for a dreary November ","Weyward by Emilia Hart, 4/5:

A beautifully written story about three women across different time periods, connected through their heritage and powers. It blends historical fiction with elements of magical realism, exploring themes of connection to nature, female empowerment, defiance of societal norms, and overcoming oppression. Heavy themes are present, so just a warning (TW: child loss, domestic violence, SA).

The writing, atmosphere, and characters are excellent. My two critiques are that the characters only overcome their biggest challenges through coming into and using their magic, which lessens the story’s impact, and much of the empowerment centers around pregnancy. While valid, this didn’t resonate as much with me personally, as a woman in my early thirties who doesn’t want children.

Where Sleeping Girls Lie by Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé, 4.5/5:

Surprisingly, one of my favorite reads in recent months. Although technically YA, it’s really well done—the writing is atmospheric, the plot is realistic, the themes are heavy (TW: SA, suicide, drugs), and the characters are diverse and well-developed. It’s a story that has lingered in my mind since I finished it a few weeks ago.

Set in an elite UK boarding school, the plot mostly revolves around rich, entitled teenagers—think dark academia meets Mean Girls with murder. It’s immersive and engaging, with a strong focus on the characters’ academic lives alongside the mystery and action, which is a nice bonus. The cast is morally ambiguous, often unlikable, with complex dynamics and lots of secrets. Themes of found family, retribution, queer representation, and a slow-burn sapphic romance add depth. And there’s a stolen pet hamster named Muffin, among other things. 

I read it around the time of the US election, which drove home one of the book’s key points: rich men can get away with almost anything. Infuriating but realistic.

The Blue Hour by Paula Hawkins, 3.5/5:

The only other book I’ve read by this author is The Girl on the Train, which I read years ago and really enjoyed. I randomly came across a post discussing her newest book and decided to pick it up. 

This is definitely more of a psychological mystery than an action thriller; the plot is fairly slow, and you can sense early on where things are headed. That being said, the atmosphere is well done—very oppressive and eerie. The present-day plot is accompanied by letters and diary entries from the past, which helps the pacing. I enjoyed it overall, though the ending was pretty depressing, and there were some unrealistic moments.

Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree, 4.5/5:

I would honestly recommend anyone give this a try, whether or not you typically enjoy fantasy. It’s described as low-stakes high fantasy, and that description fits perfectly. 

While the story is set in a world with magic and various creatures like orcs and gnomes, the focus is on the everyday life and struggles of our main character, who is starting fresh and trying to open a coffee shop in a new town, and involves everything that comes with it: renovating an old building, trying to attract customers, making friends, and lots of baked goods and coffee.

There are some hiccups along the way, but they’re resolved fairly quickly. Bonus points as there is queer representation, and the side characters are really memorable too.",11,1732206785.0,52book,3,0.93,False

**Please gays help a fellow shy androgynous woman out🥹🥹**

So I’m gonna try to make this as short as possible. I just returned to school as a 24F. I’ll be graduating in 1.5 more semesters so I’m a senior. I took a class on gender studies and it was geared more towards women studies/feminist movement which I loved. Prior to taking the class I’ve always been pretty informed on feminism and world issues, BUT the class has deepened my interest. My first class i remember seeing this girl and I just admired her beauty/style. I didn’t think much of it and went on about my day. Next day I go to recitation and guess who the teaching assistant is? Yes, it’s the girl that caught my eye the day prior. So now there’s that power dynamic which complicates things. She’s a student but she’s a PhD student and once the semester ends the power dynamic also ends. I have hardly spoken to her, but the few times we have I have just felt there’s chemistry we both recognize. She is super GAY to clarify and single but I’m 24 and she’s 30. I specifically remember one day in class I looked up to find her staring at me. I got so nervous I broke eye contact, looked away, looked back and she was still staring and then smiled at me almost flirtatiously. I had a lesbian panic attack. That’s when I really started to think there’s chemistry. But then I’m like am I overthinking? What if it was just a smile? I went to an event for extra credit and I was the only one in the class to go out of 100+ students. She showed up late and sat right behind me. When the event ended I turned around and locked eyes with her. She said “I’m so glad you were able to make it.” She makes me so nervous.. we exchanged a few words and I rushed out. I have an A in the class and overall I am a good student (3.8gpa). I will be applying for masters programs at the same Uni so I need advice on how to navigate this from my fellow gays.
 
To add we have very similar interests such as loving drag, anything pro-women, views on world issues, politics, attend the same uni…more 
SO…

**I think I am gonna go with option 1 or 2 but you guys probably have better advice. I don’t flirt with girls ever**

**Semester ends in 18 days and I have only two classes left with her therefore:**

1) do I approach her next class and try to strike up a conversation with her just to talk a bit before the semester ends? It would be a regular conversation no flirting

2) on the very last day of class should I try to strike up a quick conversation and then respectfully ask if she’s okay with exchanging instagrams

3) should I not say anything at all on the last day of class and about 2 weeks after class ends should I send a short email expressing my interests in gen studies and ask to meet up for coffee (if she’d like) to discuss navigating master programs and academics. I genuinely do need post grad help as I am completely indecisive on what to study. From there if it goes well ask to meet again?

4) Strike up a conversation with her on the last day of classes just to establish a friendship. Ask for her instagram on the last day of class because I am graduating soon and would like to stay in touch. Then 2 weeks after semester ends send her a brief email/message asking to get coffee? 

**to clarify I find her pretty, but also would be completely open to friends and her being a resource to help me navigate my post grad plans**",0,1732206700.0,LesbianActually,14,0.5,False

Gonna have to stop the meds.,"Hi friends, I can hardly write at the moment. So much despair and hopelessness. I may be one of the harder cases. Very high methane. I was so hoping I could tolerate the meds, but the side effects or the die off is too much for me. My hope at the moment is that in a few days of no meds, I will return to my baseline of feeling terrible.  I’m doing this on my own. Meaning, if I get into trouble with a medication or supplement, it’s completely up to me to pull myself through.

I had perfect health 7 years ago. Lots of stress and trauma over a long period initiated my decline. Sleep went. Then digestion. There is too much to write about. I haven’t worked in all these years. Living on disability and food stamps. Big debt trying all the fixes. Very bad histamine intolerance…seems like oxalates and salicylates causing troubles too. Eating eggs, chicken, rice, gf toast and coffee with just a little bit of coconut sugar. I am 64f. I started out at 153 at 5’3”. Now weigh 104. Took meds for h.pylori. Got Covid last Christmas. All symptoms ramped up afterwards. Not lying when I say I am skin and bones. 

I react to all histamines and Dao, Quercitin etc. I react to so many supplements. 

Once in a while, I will have a good moment. Just a moment.Between nightmares, exhaustion, loneliness, anxiety and all the stomach crap…I just don’t see the point in trying anymore. I pray all the time for death to come. 

I need help. I have a very caring therapist who I talk to on Telehealth. Thank God for her.

I (F24) am in a long term relationship with my boyfriend (M25), we’ve been together almost 2 years now. We’ve had our ups and downs, and a few months back we got into a few nasty arguments where he wanted to call the relationship quits, but we worked things out eventually, got into doing a bit of couples therapy and overall working on healing our relationship. We are now extremely happy again. 

However, his family are complete narcissists who get off on undermining him and from my understanding it’s been like this all his life, but now those behaviours have started to impact me and our relationship as well. His family is nice to me when I’m there, but when I leave he tells me they regularly gossip or make snotty remarks on me; in the time we were arguing his mom basically thought that I was “ruining” his life and went on a TikTok live telling her followers how much of a b*tch I am and I’m only a red flag here to ruin her son’s life. After finding this out he forced her to apologize which she did but exactly that, she was forced. 

She’s also not someone to respect privacy, she’ll just barge into a room without knocking, one day she barged in on us in quite a …. compromising position, and the next thing I heard she’s gossiping to the family how I only want to make sure he gets me pregnant so I can force him to stay with me. 

The latest action was his sister hosting a party for her boyfriend, inviting family and friends galore, but I’m not invited… luckily my boyfriend picked my side and stated that he won’t be attending if they want to be like that.

But honestly, what can I do? How can I even approach this family and build a good relationship with them if this is how they treat people? I want to have a good relationship with his mother as she’s going to be my MIL in a few years’ time, and also I want a good relationship with his sister where we can chat, go for coffee’s or go shopping, but none of that even seems possible at the moment. 
And my boyfriend is also torn because on the one hand it’s his family, but on the other he’s also been subjected to their brutality all this life, and he deserves happiness in his life, which I believe we’ve found in our relationship and I believe we definitely both want this to last. 

I am just so lost on how to handle the situation with his family and how to make them see that I’m trying to be the best person for their son and I’m trying to make him happy and give him the life he desserves…

- Yellow tea
- Silver needle white(?) tea

Shortly after I moved into my current house in 2021, I had a teens-early 20s girl knock on my door asking for “Casey.” I said nope, they must be a former resident. She reacted strangely, acting like she didn’t believe me, but she eventually left. I didn’t think much of it until this started happening a lot. Like every day a lot. Multiple times a day. Different people coming to the house asking for Casey. All teenagers-early 20s. I finally got one girl to tell me who this Casey was: she showed me an Instagram page called “braces by Casey” or something. It’s a service that installs vanity braces (kids these days). She (and all of these other people, too) had paid “Casey” around $50, via Cashapp, to reserve their “braces appointment,” and then “Casey” gave them MY address. I started telling every person that came by that they had been scammed.
I got a Ring camera. I got to see the volume of people coming and it was *constant* at least one person a day. Sometimes as many as SIX a day. One girl showed me her messages from the scammer instructing her to WALK IN to my home (she indeed was trying the knob while I was sitting right there having my morning coffee).
I told every person I could to report the insta account AND the cashapp account as fraud. I reported them over and over and over. I grew weary of talking about it and simply taped a sign to the door explaining it. After getting hundreds of fraud reports insta finally shut the “braces” profile down. I had about a week of peace, and then…a woman rang my doorbell saying she was here for her hair appointment and she already paid her deposit. She had a bag of weave hair in hand. The nightmare resumed. I contacted NOPD (they can’t do anything) and the FBI (they didn’t care). Finally I contacted Times-Picayune/nola.com. They ran a story that included the names of the fake accounts. It stopped INSTANTLY. I haven’t had one in almost 2 years now. I still have so many questions though…
