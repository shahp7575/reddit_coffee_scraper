My amazing fianc√©e introduced me to the glory that is green cast last year and listening to the dulcet tones of Hunter and the analytical voice of Isaiah I was inspired to write my own creepypasta. It‚Äôs in journal format, about an author who comes across a film made from a script he can‚Äôt remember writing. I finished it late last month. It‚Äôs in roughly 10 parts on my wattpad, but I‚Äôm posting it all here so I apologize if it‚Äôs a lot of text. I love writing horror stories as a hobby, but never have the time to do anything to a standard I‚Äôd really be proud of. For anyone who‚Äôs made it this far thank you and I hope you enjoy!

April 30

I‚Äôve come across a question I‚Äôm afraid to ask. 
The answer might cast a light on things I‚Äôd rather not see. Things I always chalked up to bad luck or just the way things are. I often noticed that things seemed out of place, or slightly off. It always seemed like it all could be traced back to the coma, like drops of blood combining at the edge of a drain. 
The moment that fractured everything. When recalling any memory became as difficult as seeing through a shattered window. I write this here because I feel like I can‚Äôt trust myself to remember anymore. I write this here because I could hardly ever read my own handwriting, a problem that makes the question ever harder to solve. 
The question, like a scream in the dark down the hall on a peaceful night, is unwelcome. I wonder if I should just close my eyes and wait, and hope I‚Äôd never registered it at all. 
The question.
Why can‚Äôt I remember writing The Abandoned House?


May 1

I‚Äôve realized I need to share everything here. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll remember everything the way it really happened if I don‚Äôt. Or if it won‚Äôt make sense when I do. 
I almost thought it was an April Fool‚Äôs joke at first. At the premiere of a film based on a story I‚Äôd made, The Burn Pit, one fan stopped me not to ask for an autograph or for my opinion on how they‚Äôd butchered the ending. She looked at me with a pair of bright green eyes that seemed to shine as she asked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wondered, what happened at the end of The Abandoned House, really?‚Äù 
I couldn‚Äôt help but pause. Occasionally, someone gets a title wrong, slightly altering a word or two in something I‚Äôve written. But this title brought nothing. I felt like I was peering out into a wall of fog as I searched for any hint of it. I told her it wasn‚Äôt one of mine, and her expression drifted into something more than disappointment. Something close to resentment. 
She wandered off, yet the question lingered with me. The title, The Abandoned House. It felt like something I‚Äôd write. It was like finding an old picture you‚Äôre in and being shocked you can‚Äôt place what, when, or where it was. I felt that place in the back of my mind begin to work, synapses firing and connections forming. The feeling when a new story is forming, already beginning to fight its way out. 
A quick search on my phone as I left the theater while walking to my car left me frozen in place. There on the internet movie database was the title The Abandoned House, released September 23, 1997.
And beside screenplay, my name. Matthew Rook. 

May 2
I woke up last night dripping sweat. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to look up anything else. Or maybe I haven‚Äôt had the courage. But this story keeps clawing at the corners of my mind. Normally, I‚Äôd never hold back that wonderful burst of inspiration. But this is different. I had to write something, and this is what I found on the screen after an hour of furious typing. 
The Abandoned House
Loneliness is not found when no one is around. It comes when you realize there's not enough left of you to share if there was. 

Pale amber light pours in from one of the holes where the roof had admitted defeat, a beam glistening across a cracked bottle. The structure bends and creaks in the wind now, begging for the day it will be overwhelmed.

A black rain begins to trickle down from above, heavens weeping now at what they saw. The mold metastasizing throughout the walls gleefully drank and continued to creep into every corner.

Once, laughter had filled the walls that now only harbored the blackest moss. Arguments had stained the air, drifting into cold silence that would seem searing compared to the state it was in now. The growth had infected the smallest room, worst of all, infiltrating the yellow paint and gradually overtaking the crib in the corner. It had never been touched after the day the laughter died.

I am what remains.

I am a shadow in the dark. The last gasp of a scream no one ever heard. A hand that cannot hold. A memory of a dream dissolving into dawn.

I am what remains in the husk of a home no one could live in.

Far too late, I realize there's not enough left to save. 

This isn‚Äôt how I normally write. But this is what has bubbled to the surface. Now that I‚Äôve shaken it loose, I‚Äôm going back to sleep. Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll look this movie up. 


May 3
I tried not to look it up. I thought about just waiting for the memory to fade, like a trail that hadn‚Äôt been walked on enough. But the story kept appearing in that space just behind my mind. Growing and changing. I had to know if I was dreaming up something new or just remembering an old story. 
It‚Äôs hard to recall anything from that time. I‚Äôm clean now, but before the accident I feel like days at a time vanished into the bright light a line of coke would spark in my mind. Entire stories often appeared on my old Macintosh, and some I look back on and cringe. It wouldn‚Äôt have been the first screenplay. I helped make that awful werecat movie a reality after all. It shouldn‚Äôt matter. It doesn‚Äôt matter. 
But I caved. After a quick search, I came back across the IMDb page reminding me it came out September 23, 1997. Just months before everything changed. But the results abruptly ended there. No streaming platforms listed, not one link to watch online. Nothing showed on Nesearch,tflix, Amazon, or any cult movie sites. Not even a bootleg YouTube with potato quality. No age old used DVD or VHS copies floating around. 
All I could find were a few mentions on fan forums and an article from an archived GeoCities page calling it an ‚Äúuneven, haunting gem with an ending that is what you make of it.‚Äù A few mentions of how impossible it was to find. I eventually switched back to IMDb and scanned the rest of the credits.
The director had died in 2003. Not one actor from the three main cast had filmed another movie. The database didn‚Äôt even have headshots for them. It felt like the entire project had come and gone, like an eclipse. 
The only name I could recognize was Elliot Grayson, the producer. I‚Äôd worked with him a few times in the mid 2000s, before any of my stories really started making money in Hollywood. He‚Äôd been professional but distant. He preferred to say as little as possible, and I remembered liking that. 
I‚Äôm leaning back in my chair, trying to recall something I don‚Äôt think ever happened while resisting my imagination‚Äôs call to arms. My heart was pounding, but I couldn‚Äôt say why. It feels like I‚Äôm trying to recall someone else‚Äôs half-forgotten dream the next day. 
Why can‚Äôt I remember writing it? And why do I feel so afraid of finding out? 

May 3
 
I can‚Äôt sleep anymore. I wake up and the story screams behind my eyes, begging me to work on it. Some part of me almost hopes I can finish this draft before I do find the movie, so I can see which turned out better. I found myself typing this morning, cold coffee sitting beside me only growing colder.
 
This is what I‚Äôve made so far.
 
The Abandoned House
 
The bottle slipped from his hand across the filth covered floor, rattle echoing through empty walls. For a moment, his hazel eyes fell on it and searched for shards of shattered glass. Then he laughed‚Äîa hollow, rasping sound that fell off the peeling paint throughout the home.
 
Of course it didn‚Äôt. He thought to himself, though he could not place what that made it so funny.
 
He hauled himself to his feet, swaying as the room began to tilt. A layer of grime cushioned every footfall, the accumulated decay a soft and strangely comforting. The flickering lights offered little clarity, sputtering in and out of existence like a memory just out of reach.
 
He fought through unsteady steps as long as he could until one foot landed wrong. The fall knocked the air from his lungs, but the impact did not feel the way it should have. Instead, the weight of the house pressed in on him as he laid on his side‚Äîthe damp rot, the stale air, the relentless quiet. He laughed again, the sound sharper this time. He searched the floor for his phone, though he knew there was no one he could call.
 
Nobody would answer. Not for him.
 
A gust of wind cut through the room, unexpected frigid air kicking up dust and debris as it squeezed in through every broken window and crack in the walls. He squinted into the dimness, trying to pinpoint its source. He told himself he would check tomorrow, though it was another lie.
 
The fridge groaned, a low, mournful sound that echoed through the kitchen. He was not sure why, but the interruption left him started. He shuffled toward it, fumbling inside and pulling out the one thing it still offered. Another drink.
 
He unscrewed the cap and tossed the plastic over his shoulder, unbothered when it came to rest silently. The whiskey burned his throat in a way that felt familiar, almost comforting. He sank into a corner of the room, shadows embracing him like an old friend.
 
Kyle closed his eyes and tried to remember how he had ended up like this. For what felt like hours, he sifted through dead memories, though none of them seemed to fit. The house creaked and groaned around him, alive in ways he could not be. When he opened his eyes again, the illusion of warmth was gone.
 
Leaves drifted through the shattered windows, dancing through the otherwise still air. The fridge door hung open, its insides empty and silent. The bottle in his hand was dry now, though he did not remember drinking the last.
 
All that remained now was the house.
 
Sitting back, I stare at the name the longest. I usually labor over them, struggling to find the one that sounds right. That has some personal meaning that isn‚Äôt too obvious. But like the rest of this story, it simply appeared.
 
It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt stop it.

May 5
I spent all yesterday sleeping, lost in a dark and twisting adventure behind my eyes that I can‚Äôt recall. Like so many things. I think the sleep did me well. I felt so worn down and ragged the last few days. All I had done was write a bit, and yet it felt like I was on the verge of collapse.
 This morning, I shot an email to the producer on the film, Elliot Grayson. Our last communique was over a decade ago working on an adaptation of one of my more action focused stories. The movie itself turned out well. But from what I recall, it almost felt like he spent the production avoiding me. Looking over our emails, it seems like he always waited as long as possible to answer. Most producers I work alongside now are eager for any insight or detail, often if only to paint the production an air of legitimacy.
That‚Äôs why I was all the more surprised when he fired back an answer not two hours later. He said The Abandoned House was a small, indie production I hold sold the rights to for next to nothing. He said he‚Äôd asked why and had told him I didn‚Äôt like the idea enough to make it a novel. When he asked, I had told him it had turned out fine, but I simply didn‚Äôt like making it.
I wonder if I had that same feeling as I do now, of the story threatening to tear its way out if I did not commit it to a page in time. To find some use for it. He finished by saying unfortunately he didn‚Äôt have a copy, and the movie had sold so poorly it had never even seen a reprint after a first VHS run, no doubt after a few of my other works took off. He wasn‚Äôt even sure who held the rights now.
I sent one question back, asking if he could remember the story of the movie. It shouldn‚Äôt have surprised me when no answer came. For some time, I tried to connect the things he had said to what memories I could exhume.
It‚Äôs so hard to remember anything from that time. I had in the past chalked it up to the cocktail of drinks and drugs I‚Äôd blamed all my creativity on. I made a lot of poor choices back then. The kind that end with being you found half dead on the side of the highway. Just recalling that road sends a slight shiver down my spine.
 The only one other person I can think to ask about all this never answered the last few times I tried. I really doubt she wants a trip down memory lane because I can‚Äôt remember writing some movie.
Maybe a thrift story or the library might have a copy. I think I‚Äôll try tomorrow. I‚Äôm not sure why, but I feel tired again.

Amber.
Her name on my phone made the device feel heavier. I couldn‚Äôt say what scared me more; if she were to ignore my question or the sound of her voice if she answered. Time seemed to vanish, the clock on my phone leaving me behind. Before I could force a decision, another name replaced her as the dial trilled.
Barry, my agent.
I let out a long breath I didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd been holding and answered the call.
‚ÄúMatty,‚Äù He began without any preamble, accented voice tinged with humor, ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd have heard from you by now, and gotten all your gripes about what they did to Burn Pit.‚Äù I felt my brow furrowing and was surprised to find the premier had been the last thing on my mind lately.
‚ÄúYou thought I‚Äôdwith no be mad they cut the teeth scenes.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe big wigs said it was too much for audiences to take. They wouldn‚Äôt even let the director film the first one for an unrated version, though the second is on film somewhere.‚Äù He behind his typical bravado, I almost felt a hint of worry creeping into his voice. I normally would have reached out to him by now if this story hadn‚Äôt crashed through my every waking hour since. Regardless, I couldn‚Äôt help but ask him,
‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôve been working together for what, almost twenty years, right?‚Äù His response was uncharacteristically unsure,
There was a brief pause. ‚ÄúI mean, yeah. In that ballpark. Is uh, everything okay Matt?‚Äù
I already knew he had no answers, but asked anyway, ‚ÄúDid you ever see The Abandoned House? I wrote its screenplay before we started working together.‚Äù
To my surprise, Barry answered, ‚ÄúYeah, I caught part of it on TV back in the 90s. Honestly? I didn‚Äôt really get it. I thought you just wanted a quick buck.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat was it about?‚Äù
Another pause, longer this time. The silence buzzing in my ear growing into a roar until he recanted, ‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt finish it, sorry. I had a lady friend coming over. But it had some guy stuck in a house. A ghost maybe? Mysterious as hell, and then I got a bit distracted. If you want, I can try to find you a copy.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôd be great. Thanks Barry.‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt press for any details. Instead, he shifted into mentioning our editor was excited to see the next draft of the black hole story. I mumbled a lie that I‚Äôd send it soon and hung up to find her name still on the screen waiting for me.
Amber.
Memories seeped through my mind despite every attempt to keep them at bay. For years, she was the only person willing to put up with me. She worked two jobs back when my early books barely made a dent, and yet we had been happy barely scratching by. When things changed and money became no issue, she just kept working anyway. Said she couldn‚Äôt sit around and watch me write all day.
She was patient at first. Even when I disappeared for hours at a time on long dark roads with my mind abuzz from whatever I could get my hands on. But in time, the stories I was writing were overtaking me, the same ones she had fought so hard to let me make. The more I wrote, the less of me there was left to offer.
After the accident, her kindness faded. She often implied I wasn‚Äôt the man she‚Äôd married. It‚Äôs not fair to blame her. I never acted in violence, but I took every ounce of pain and withdrawal out on her. Even my memory, or lack of it.
For a while, she was patient. Understanding that being in a coma for a month may leave someone with memory loss, but it was worse than that. I wasn‚Äôt just healing, but struggling to escape the whirlpool of withdrawal. She came to believe I simply lied to her any time I couldn‚Äôt remember something.
It ended on a Friday night. She said I‚Äôd forgotten our anniversary, though I rudely snapped back it wasn‚Äôt until the next week. I should have looked at the calendar. I should have apologized. Instead, I let my anger spill out on her regardless of if she deserved it.
She stared at me for a long time. Then, in a quiet voice, she asked, ‚ÄúMatt, look at me. Can you even tell me where we met?‚Äù
I rolled my eyes and quickly answered. ‚ÄúWe met at the carnival. James introduced me to you. I asked if you wanted to ride the spinning UFO, and you grabbed my hand when it started.‚Äù
Her blue eyes seemed to burn through me as she stared, offering no response. She glanced down at her hands before slowly prying her ring off and setting it on the table. The front door slamming was her last answer.
I‚Äôm afraid to ask her. Afraid I don‚Äôt deserve an answer. Would her answer change anything? Or would she leave me in silence, like on that Friday night?

May 7
I dreamt of the road again last night.
Wesley Earl Road, an unassuming turn off Transmountain Highway that ends up twisting and turning through the jagged burst of rock that emerged from the desert millions of years ago. I often dream I‚Äôm driving down a long, winding road on the edge of a cliff but don‚Äôt even recall the name the next day. But last night, it was as clear as the moon hanging in the night sky.
I used to disappear into the jaws of that road for hours at a time, mind reeling from whatever I shouldn‚Äôt have taken before getting behind the wheel. Yet no matter how far I drove, my watch and speedometer would always yield little, and eventually I‚Äôd lose my buzz and turn around before coming home. I never reached the end, even though one night I‚Äôd almost met mine on it.
I always went down the road because no one else seemed to. The road was too narrow in places for two cars despite the yellow divider line in the middle‚Äôs claim. What almost felt lie whispered warnings came at the last second, and I often yanked the wheel one way or the other to make a sharp turn when lost in thought. I had some of my best ideas as my car screamed over the road‚Äôs cracked pavement, though I couldn‚Äôt honestly recall one I‚Äôd used in any story.
The road always took more than it gave.
Between serving as an initial pressure point between Amber and I and the promise of danger it eventually kept, I lost a lot out on that road.
A familiar pain in my left leg seeps in as I‚Äôm writing this. The familiar sensation, like an old friend, tends to fade with time but never truly abandons me. That place where the bone in my leg bent but somehow didn‚Äôt fully break. The abnormal injury that the doctors said was normally only seen in young children had haunted my efforts to learn to walk again after I woke up. I sometimes wonder if a piece of me is still out there, and if I drove back, what I‚Äôd find.
I never had gone back after the accident. Never even paid it much thought before The Abandoned House began bleeding back into my life. It occurs to me now that I can‚Äôt remember the night of the accident. If I hit something, or swerved off the road to avoid something that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.
I pause at that thought. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that could have meant, and I am surprised such an idea appeared. The only thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been there that night was me. That I can be sure of.
For now, I‚Äôm going back to writing. 
May 7
My head is killing me, but the next page is born. While stopping never felt like a possibility, every paragraph felt like pulling a tooth out with a pair of pliers. I briefly wonder if there was a way to tastefully change the scene in The Burn Pit to allow them to use it. Doesn‚Äôt matter now. Writing this feels like an urgent step and yet hours flicker by for only a page to present itself when I‚Äôm briefly satisfied.
Can‚Äôt think of anything more to say. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I wanted a drink more. See below:
 
‚Äî-
Sunlight trickled in through the broken, boarded-up windows to cast slivers of golden light that gradually dances across the floor as hours passed until one met his closed eye. He blinked slowly, hazel eyes flecked with flecks of gray, struggling to adjust to the harsh reality that day brought. Now there were no shadows left to blot out the rotting corpse of a beautiful home around him.
 
For a moment he wondered when it had begun to decay, but no answer came.
 
The front door was hanging on by splinters, the lock uselessly set on a barrier that could hardly hold the wind at bay. The ceiling above him on the first floor had succumbed to the weight of water over time, sagging in places that hadn‚Äôt already given way to drop chunks of rotted drywall to the floor. Scattered needles and bottles lay about, and he could almost convince himself they weren‚Äôt his.
 
Almost.
 
He realized the sight of the home decomposing around him should spark a feeling of abject horror, but despair was his only constant companion. It seemed impossible for anyone to actually live in what was left here and yet, he couldn‚Äôt actually recall the last time he‚Äôd stepped outside. It felt like he‚Äôd always been here, trapped in a forgotten story that no one told.
 
He also felt like he realized all of this before.
 
A gust of wind tore through, whipping the worn pages of an old leather-bound journal resting on an uneven table in the kitchen. He ran his hand over the yellowed pages, feeling for the forgotten words within. He flipped through the diary and was surprised to find all but one page remained empty. On one page he found words scrawled in black in that read, ‚ÄúYou have to let her go.‚Äù Kyle felt his brow crease at the command, doubting he had written such a message.
 
The answers seemed as lost as his home now.
 
He slipped the journal into his back pocket and turned to face the vestige of a front door. He wondered if he should grab a coat, but let the idea fade away as any time spent within could lead to him losing more time. With a deep breath, he stepped through the ruined doorway out into an alien world kissed by the sun.
 
 May 15
It‚Äôs been a few days since I updated anything. I‚Äôve been trying to find things. Going through old photo albums, digging up anything I can in old laptops from that time. It doesn‚Äôt help that after the divorce, I put very little thought into preserving the past. I just kept working, convincing myself that if I wrote enough good stories and had enough money that everything would eventually click into place.
But without Amber, it all just felt hollow. I was like a ghost walking through my life, unaware that the accident on that highway years ago had killed the human part of me. It‚Äôs not something I linger on, but it often feels like my life just happens around me. It‚Äôs only times like now where I confront my inactivity.
A character caught between pages, realizing something isn‚Äôt right.
But enough pretentious musing. I had an odd memory the other night. I found a picture of my old Mazda, a beautiful silver convertible I had loved to drive with the top down deep into the night. Something about it stirred a recollection in me, a memory bubbling to the surface of my mind.
The night of the accident, I‚Äôd found a bridge on Wesley Earl Road. I wasn‚Äôt sure of anything beyond that, but I felt like my adventure had ended that night on the bridge.
I‚Äôm not sure how many more answers I can find here. In the meantime, I managed to finish another page.
 
-       - -
He wasn‚Äôt sure how long he‚Äôd been gone, but the town had not waited for a triumphant return. None of the faces felt familiar, and despite recognizing street names, he was surprised repeatedly by how the businesses all seemed to bear unfamiliar names. It was clear he was past the point of asking anyone for help.
The midway sun washed the world in stark, pale white light and he couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if it only seemed so to him. Another question constantly burrowing in the corner of his mind was where he was intending to go. His legs seemed to carry him across the bleached pavement with a sense of purpose he didn‚Äôt understand in the slightest.
It wasn‚Äôt until he came to rest before a large, imposing structure that he recognized the destination. The sight of ‚ÄúArthur Clarke Hospital‚Äù emblazoned across the side of the building made his stomach churn. The nausea fled as he realized there was nothing inside to heave, anyway.
The cry of a crow caught his attention, followed by the rustle of wings slicing through the air. He turned to find a thin figure draped in black now standing behind him. The figure was pale, with paper white features and long platinum hair whose strands seemed immune to the wind. The lanky man flashed a disarming smile and answered before being asked, ‚ÄúYes, I can see you.‚Äù
Kyle‚Äôs voice caught in his throat, silence stretching between the pair until the man added, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect you to remember me. You never do.‚Äù
A car drifted between us, brakes sighing as it came to a stop. The occupants remained staring ahead, blissfully unaware of the exchange. With a touch of hesitation, he asked, ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ Death?‚Äù
A rough laugh escaped the man. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carl, actually. The big man rarely takes shifts anymore. No, I was once like you. Though, maybe not as big a pain in the ass.‚Äù
Kyle turned away to face the hospital, still at a loss for why he‚Äôd felt so driven to come here. He felt a growing sense of dread that culminated in the question, ‚ÄúAre you here to take me?‚Äù
Carl‚Äôs smile sharpened, his porcelain features set into a grim mask as he replied, ‚ÄúYou have to be ready. We only force the violent ones. You‚Äôre not there, yet. For now, you‚Äôre still harmless.‚Äù After a pregnant pause, Carl seemed satisfied he‚Äôd made his point and finished, ‚ÄúKeep checking your journal. I‚Äôll be around.‚Äù
 Kyle turned back at the sound of another wing beat to find the road behind him empty again. His fingers grasped the leather binding of the journal and he brought it into the light, flipping to a random page. To his surprise, a new message awaited him, scrawled with fresh ink.
She never even had a chance.
 May 20
I drove down Wesley Earl Road last night. It was completely different in the absence of any drugs or alcohol, yet the road played its same old tricks. I drove for what felt like hours, only to find my clock had inched ahead by forty-two minutes. My speedometer told a similar lie. In the end, I turned around and came home without incident. 
It felt like the longer I was on that road, the more pronounced every bump and turn grew, as though warning me away from something terrible. My nerves eventually won out, and I turned around long before confirming if there was any bridge at the end, or if that had all been a mistaken memory. In the meantime, I finished another page of The Abandoned House. It feels like the story is ending, and with it I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll find. Even though I‚Äôm writing it. 
Aren‚Äôt I? Who else could be writing it?
-	- - 
Kyle‚Äôs legs carried him down an unknown path, each automatic step detached from his wandering thoughts. His mind flickered back to the first moment he ever truly felt alive. When a smile alone nearly knocked him off his feet. Annabelle‚Äôs smile. It was such a radiant, wide grin that seemed so disconnected from the rest of the world and its troubles. He saw it again the day he worked up the nerve to ask out the prettiest cashier in all of Redbrook. 
Their fate was sealed. 
Dates, anniversaries, family dinners, fights, moonlit walks and a modest wedding all flickered through his mind in seconds like a dream dissolving into dawn. The sweetest memories now stung the most. At the end of the chain he recalled the day the pair were lost blanched white walls with Annabelle crying and a professional walking them through what came next. Telling them it happens more often than people think. The moment gave birth to an anger and sadness that stripped the color from his heart. 
Nights spent losing himself in drinking came to mind. The endless silence filling the void between the two in their bed every night. The moment he‚Äôd stumbled in later than he‚Äôd meant to and found her beside a puddle of vomit filled with pills. 
The sky had been crying that night with him. He stopped walking to find himself staring at a grave. Though Annabelle‚Äôs name was alone on the stone, he felt two lives lost in the soil. He glanced down at the journal again to find fresh words within.
You weren‚Äôt there. Even when you were. 
He felt himself moving, but simply let himself ride passenger again on the way home. Before the door to the abandoned house, he stopped and looked over to find Carl waiting with a smaller smile than before. He asked the apparition, ‚ÄúHow many times have I made it this far?‚Äù 
The reaper now stood next to him, silver eyes staring into the remnants of a forlorn home. Another gust of wind sprinted past and rattled the boards lining the windows. Eyes set afar he replied, ‚ÄúFive times. It‚Äôs been almost a decade. You‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm so patient.‚Äù 
This time, his legs seemed to be patiently awaiting orders. Kyle nodded, contemplating what awaited him within. He asked the angel, ‚ÄúWhy would you do this for me?‚Äù 
Wide smile returning to his sharp features Carl answered, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only two kinds of spirits. The ones who move on and the ones that get destroyed. You‚Äôve come close a few times. Lashed out at kids fucking around in there, but I think you can do it. It wasn‚Äôt easy for me, either.‚Äù 
He nodded at the reaper and smiled back as best he could. He wanted to ask what he needed to do but already knew. Kyle took a step into the doorway and stopped at the sound of Carl warning, ‚ÄúNo pressure but, soon I may not have a choice.‚Äù 
Kyle turned to his only friend in the afterlife and nodded. Carl added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right outside, no matter what happens.‚Äù

It all came back to me in a moment. Almost like the memory had always been there and I just didn‚Äôt want to retrieve it. When you wake up from a dream, the things your mind made up while your eyes were closed begin to fade. It‚Äôs different with a coma. When you wake, it feels like your memories and dreams entwine, like a tree grows around a signpost planted through its roots. Everything becomes a question. 
That night I found the bridge, it wasn‚Äôt night at all.
Dawn had begun to creep over the mountain, sunlight spilling through clouds suffocating the sky in a pale, almost white haze. I had come across a bridge and without a second thought begun barreling across it. In the fog, a rarity in such an acrid climate, I was surprised to find the bridge beginning to turn to the left. Most were long, straight affairs. 
It was only when I began spinning my wheel I saw it. I can‚Äôt say for certain if I was on the wrong side of the road, or he was. A pair of headlights burst out from the silent wall of white between us, directly coming my way on the narrow bridge. I swore aloud and yanked my wheel in the opposite direction, glaring stare leaving the road to try and take in the car I was careening to miss. 
It was a silver Mazda with the top down. In the driver‚Äôs seat a similar glare came to meet my own. Except it wasn‚Äôt similar. It was mine. For one instant, I saw myself in the car I‚Äôd just swerved to miss on the bridge that concluded Wesley Earl Road. 
And then months of darkness followed, swallowing up the unwanted memory. There isn‚Äôt anything else left to say. The only thoughtsI have are in a word, crazy. 

May 30
This is the end. 
I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time I drive to the end of the road. Find the bridge and see what‚Äôs waiting for me there. Maybe I am. I think now about the bent bone in my leg. To fix it, they had to snap it in three places and then reset it back to a straight line. 
Barry came through with a copy of the movie. Old and weathered, it nonetheless is the version of The Abandoned House he made back in the 90s. It‚Äôs a lot like mine, but the ending is different. I think it‚Äôs the last thing I needed to make up my mind. 
I‚Äôm going to put my last page here. I hope whoever finds it can understand. It might just be me, tired after a long fruitless drive. Or it might be someone else. Either way, I hope it finds you well. 
I hope it all makes sense.

Kyle stepped through the door; his jacket tossed behind him. His eyes quickly snapped to an orange prescription bottle on the counter, and he wasted no time swallowing two Percocet with the help of some whiskey. He settled into his chair and waited for the mix of fire and medicine to find balance within him. 
A phone rang somewhere in the distance, its shrill tone piercing the silence. He ignored it, already certain any concern shown on the other end was just to mask contempt. He lifted the bottle and took another steady pull, before finding two more pills to down with a shrug. 
The world around him began to tilt, edges blurring into a comforting oblivion as he grinned at the thought of feeling nothing. Rising on quaking legs he leaned against the dining table and swayed his way over to the journal where he scrawled one last entry. His gaze drifted over to the corner of the room, at an empty object that he could never part with and yet tore his heart out with every viewing. He didn‚Äôt look at the words left on the paper. 
As Kyle stumbled around the room and finished off the bottle he eventually discovered a bottle of cough syrup and consumed that as well. As a Herculean feat, he hoisted himself back into his chair and collapsed into it. Every breath seemed a bit slower than the last, and his thoughts became aborted syllables echoing throughout an empty mind. Only one last thought broke though- had he taken too much?
As he leaned back, his eyes fluttered shut for the last time. From the doorway, what remained of him watched the scene with baleful, distant eyes. He watched the memory play out. He watched the broken man die in that chair. He cautiously approached the table, eyes welling with tears as they read the last words left in the journal.
We were going to name her Laura. 
The floor gave out beneath him and Kyle fell to his knees, eyes now coming to rest on the shattered crib in the corner of the decaying room. He released a raw, anguished cry as the memories all came flooding back. On the floor he shook and wept, recalling the very moment he‚Äôd died. It hadn‚Äôt been alone in that chair. 
It was in that pale white room in the hospital. 
He struggled to his feet; the lights in the house flickering to reveal a familiar world he imagined and the decaying truth. Settling back into the all too familiar chair he looked beside him, at a bottle of whiskey half full. 
Carl stood in the doorway, watching intently. Kyle‚Äôs fingers wrapped around the bottle cap, twisting it off as he brought the glass to his lips. He couldn‚Äôt let go. Could never begin to forgive himself for something he didn‚Äôt do. One last thought slipped through his mind as the liquor kissed the edge of his tongue, bringing him pause.
Is this what Laura would have wanted?
The bottle fell to the floor of the abandoned house, echoing alone.

I mean it honestly hurts me because specs wise the ps5 is still pretty decent and compared to the ps4 it just completely shits on it and I honestly don't blame people for seeing it as a ps4 pro 2.0.

because besides r* and naughty dog plus afew unreleased games from some other devs nobody seems to be pushing it truly.

some people say it's already reached its limits due to all these games that just come out broken and even run like ass on top end pcs without the help of dlss.

but performance aside I truly believe it's the best PS console we've ever gotten .
it's super customizable and easy to clean while still being build pretty solid too.

As for the daulsense it's gotta be  the best controller ever made imo.

 but man there gotta be a study on how many devs seems to just not care to actually use it properly.
if asobo didn't drop the Astros play room games to show mfs how it's supposed to work and be done I think people would have called the marketing bs and full of lies.

Alot of people probably do because soo  many people instantly uninstalled Astros play room without even touching it so now all they know are the Luke warm shitty coffee type implementations

If you‚Äôre seeking¬†*vacation rentals USA*¬†or¬†*luxury holiday rentals USA*, platforms like LLIVO can provide the perfect starting point for exploring cities rich in history and culture.

# Napoleon and Vienna‚Äôs Historic Connection

Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs connection to Vienna is deeply rooted in history, from his military campaigns to his diplomatic maneuvers. During his occupation of the city in 1805 and 1809, Napoleon made his mark on Vienna‚Äôs landmarks, including the iconic¬†*Sch√∂nbrunn Palace*, which served as his headquarters during his second stay.

Walking through Sch√∂nbrunn‚Äôs grand halls and manicured gardens today, you can almost feel the weight of history and the echoes of decisions that shaped Europe. Napoleon‚Äôs presence in Vienna was not only political but deeply personal, as his life intersected with stories of romance and ambition. Whether you're staying in¬†*vacation homes in USA*¬†or historical hubs like Vienna, the allure of such stories adds to the experience.

# The Love Story of Napoleon and D√©sir√©e

D√©sir√©e Clary, once engaged to Napoleon, holds a unique place in his life and letters. Although their engagement ended when Napoleon chose to marry Josephine for political gain, D√©sir√©e‚Äôs connection to him endured. She eventually became Queen of Sweden, but her early correspondence with Napoleon reflects a heartfelt bond.

During his time in Vienna, it‚Äôs said that Napoleon‚Äôs letters to D√©sir√©e revealed a man torn between duty and personal longing. These emotional writings, filled with both regret and affection, provide a glimpse into his vulnerability‚Äîa side not often associated with the conqueror.

For travelers exploring Vienna, understanding this love story adds a human element to the grandeur of Sch√∂nbrunn Palace and other historic sites. To fully immerse in such historical journeys, finding¬†*rooms in USA for rent*¬†or in historical European cities with platforms like LLIVO can enhance the experience.

# Vienna Beyond the Story

While Napoleon and D√©sir√©e‚Äôs story captivates the romantic, Vienna‚Äôs history offers so much more to uncover. The city‚Äôs legendary coffee houses, where intellectuals and artists gathered, the legacy of the¬†**Ottoman sieges**, and its transformation into a cultural hub all contribute to its layered charm.

As you stroll along the Ringstrasse, take a moment to imagine the lives lived within these historic streets. Each building, park, and plaza tells a story waiting to be discovered. With platforms like¬†[LLIVO](https://www.llivo.com/p/explore-llivo-rentals), visitors can find accommodations that immerse them in the heart of Vienna‚Äôs history, offering a perfect base for exploration. LLIVO is not just a¬†**vacation rental agency**, it‚Äôs a gateway to experiences that connect travelers with the essence of their destinations.

# Why These Stories Matter

Learning about the love, ambition, and struggles of historical figures like Napoleon and D√©sir√©e transforms your travel experience. It‚Äôs no longer just about landmarks and itineraries; it‚Äôs about connecting with the city on a deeper level. These stories remind us that even the most powerful figures were human, shaped by emotions and relationships.

Uncovering these tales as you explore Vienna adds richness to your journey, turning each step into a page of history come alive. For those planning trips closer to home, exploring¬†*holiday rentals USA*¬†or¬†*vacation rentals company*¬†listings can offer similar cultural insights.

# Final Words

Vienna is a city of music, art, and romance, but it‚Äôs also a city of stories‚Äîstories that reveal the humanity behind its grandeur.

I am [F26], have ADHD and am in a relationship with [M35].
My sister got us to meet after he saw pictures of me on her phone years ago and was interested. Since I was in a relationship back then she said no. I got out of the last abusive one, waited a few months to find myself again and then we met up and started dating.

Everything was fine the first months. We went to concerts, a big holiday, did a lot of gardening and so on.
But a few months ago he started to be annyed with me.
He'd tell me not to talk as loud, which is fair, I do have trouble regulating volume sometimes,  but he said it more rude every time.

At some point I started to life at his place, keeping mine though. 
I only hat a nook between the couch and a shelf for my hobby stuff, even though there is a whole mostly empty room with space that is stuffed full of junk he wants to get rid off.

Now, one evening, he got tipsy with his buddies and he told me he'd get real clingy in the evening. We got food that I usually eat buns with, but he told me we got some at home. 
So at home I wanted to get some in the oven but the oven cleaner he left in there was dry and not easy to remove.
I ranted a bit and he went in the kitchen and told me that I should leave, it would be best right then and there, or he might say stuff he shouldn't. 

So I cried, packed up some things and left.
I swore to myself to leave him if it ever happens again.
He wanted me back 2 days later.
I have been distand ever since, trying to be quiet and to leave him be.
Something broke in me that day.

So, onto the current situation.
I got up 10 minutes before him, like always, to get ready and the bathroom free for his things.
I made him his coffee and he came in, telling me that my alarm wakes him and to please make his coffee first. 
I was taken aback but just said ok.
I only do this cause he usually has to doodoo in about 10 minutes when the coffe cigarette combo hits.
I went to work after and around midday he texted, asking if I could please stay at my place for my lateshift days.
So I left. I packed up everything and left.
He didn't seem to notice, or at least he didn't text anything.

I just cant do this anymore.
I want...ed to move in with him, marry him, have kids and he knew that. I don't see him capable of raising kids anymore, he gets annoyed too fast.

When we talked about marriage he sternly said no, he doesn't see a reason to, it only costs money.
And whenever his buddies ask him why I haven't moved in yet he avoids the question.

80% of our outings are usually with his buddies or old friends, even the concert and the vacation. We only do things together when I plan a dinner date or he wants to go for a walk.

We will have a talk this weekend that I'm not looking forward to.

If there are any question I'll answer them as soon as I can, need to go to bed soon though, so in the morning.
Sorry for spelling and stuff, emotional and not native.

I don't know if I am acting rational here.
How can I or we safe this relationship if at all possibleor feasible?

There are many other books that are much more interesting to read that sound like they were written by a human than this one. I gave it two stars because if you know nothing about Frank Zappa and just want some very basic information with multiple sentences that sound like they are saying the same thing just in different ways with Different Adjectives and thesaurus generated words then I guess this book will do.

General info:
‚Ä¢Vinyl record themed speakeasy.
‚Ä¢Choose from selection of records then signup on sheet to have bartender play them. Records change every 20 minutes.
‚Ä¢Special Events!
‚Ä¢New quick cocktails!
‚Ä¢New West Coast beers!
‚Ä¢Unique front door design.
‚Ä¢Decorated with vintage, music, book, and vinyl record themes in mind.
‚Ä¢New social media campaign.
‚Ä¢New custom decorations.

Front Door Design:
‚Ä¢Hidden! Something I love, will attract social media attention, and increases feeling of exclusivity.
‚Ä¢Personalized ‚ÄúSide B Speakeasy‚Äù record as sign.
‚Ä¢Mini-library on the front for leaving books, music, etc. The rest of the door will be covered in beautiful artificial plants and flowers.
‚Ä¢Behind the door are colorfully decorated walls, blacklights, neon designs, a mirror for selfies, and a sign in book.
‚Ä¢I‚Äôll build the Mini-free-library at cost.

Decoration Savings:
‚Ä¢Broken, secondhand, & thrift store instruments to hang on walls.
‚Ä¢Ask customers & locals to sign and donate their own vinyl's, CD‚Äôs, tapes, and instruments to add to the wall.
‚Ä¢I can print posters at school for cheaper than retail price.
‚Ä¢Bookshelf: music history, musician biographies, Alexandria history, Del Ray history, drink recipes, pizza recipes. Ask bookstore for bulk and neighborhood discount. I can build bookshelf or find a cheap/free secondhand one online.
‚Ä¢Estate sales, Facebook marketplace, thrift stores for retro furniture.
‚Ä¢Exhibit & Earn Program: Local artists hang art in speakeasy, pay 20% sale fee.
I can help locate old furniture and restore it at-cost.

Purchased Decorations:
‚Ä¢Historic Beatles memorabilia x3: $69.
‚Ä¢Order custom DRP record: $70. Sign for front door?
‚Ä¢Paint stairwell, neon designs, blacklights.
‚Ä¢Vinyl Record Clock: $19.
‚Ä¢Wallpaper front facing steps on staircase.

Cocktails:
‚Ä¢Lavender Fields Forever: vodka, elderflower or lavender liquer, and lemonade premade in large batch. Add fresh lavender and ice, stir, serve.
‚Ä¢VODKA REDBULL!
‚Ä¢Bourbon Barrel Old Fashioned: Premade old fashioned stored in stylish mini bourbon barrel. Pour, add ice and cherry, garnish with orange peel. Best if stored for 1-2 weeks. Personalized barrels available.
‚Ä¢Espresso Martini: Premade espresso, vodka, and coffee liqeur. Shake with ice to create foam, garnish with coffee beans. Make them cheap and small.
‚Ä¢Sangria: Premade red wine, brandy, and orange juice. Pour over ice and add orange wheel.


Foods:
The idea of this food menu is to be simple, fancy, fun, and have a high profit margin. The full menu from the restaurant below will also be avaible.
‚Ä¢Pizzas served on vinyl record platters.
Deserts
‚Ä¢Brown M&M‚Äôs: $5 for a bowl. Van Halen reference.
‚Ä¢Million-dollar Oreo: $20. 24k gold foil covered oreo cakester. $4 cost per serving. Top with whipped cream and crushed pistachios.
‚Ä¢Boozy Cherry Desert Bombs: $10. 3 decorated, high-quality, chocolate covered, spiced rum infused cherries.
‚Ä¢Vinyl record cookies.

Social media campaign
‚Ä¢Start ‚ÄúSide B Speakeasy‚Äù profiles on: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, X, Threads, Yelp, Google, Pinterest, Bluesky, Untappd, LinkedIn, Youtube, Tik Tok?
‚Ä¢Update DRP website with secret link for speakeasy homepage (vinyl record with hyperlink?)
‚Ä¢Tease location in posts: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to this library than meets the eye‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSide A on the bottom, Side B on ____.‚Äù
‚Ä¢Collaborate with local social media influencers.
‚Ä¢Pay employees $1 for every proven repost, $0.10 for every like.
‚Ä¢Vinyl Votes: Make polls on profiles for followers to vote on what vinyl records should be give away as prizes during events.
‚Ä¢What‚Äôs your Side B?: Challenge for followers to repost video of their favorite Side B vinyl record songs with #SideBSpeakeasy hashtag for chance to win vinyl record, gift card, free grou[p drtinks.
‚Ä¢Repost and show to bartender for free cocktail shot (premade ones).
‚Ä¢$5 espresso martini‚Äôs opening month!

 I‚Äôm accumulating samples again after a long break from indie fragrance and exploring niche. Trying to stay organized with these and reviewing them as I go along so I have a catalog. I made a huge purchase of Immortal Perfume samples (the whole set) and have also been buying deals here and there!¬†

  
I'm still trying to find that ""omg this is it!"" scent that makes me happily and joyfully full-size without regret. 

# SORCE FIRST! 

**Matcha made in heaven ‚Äî ¬†Matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood**

 I‚Äôve heard about this scent forever and I‚Äôve been dubious about it. Un Ete is my favorite scent ‚Äî it‚Äôs a niche matcha scent I‚Äôm obsessed with because it has matcha but it isn‚Äôt super sweet and I find a lot of matcha scents are WAY too sweet. I really like matcha made in heaven and I‚Äôm shocked cause I tend to really dislike heavy gormounds but I think this one will layer nicely. I would buy another 2ml spray sample before I‚Äôd consider getting a full bottle because I‚Äôm afraid it might turn on me but I like it. Pleasantly surprised. Maybe i'd full size out the gate because it's too hard to get? haha. Does anyone have a good dupe for it. 

The vibe: It‚Äôs giving first date or being around a crush and you want them to double take and double sniff.¬†



**Venus In Fleurs ‚Äî Ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absolute**

 I smell a LOT OF PERFUMES and I feel like I don‚Äôt tend to get shocked by a smell very often but this shocked me. The initial spray is this shocking alien like smell feels kind of like a sci-fi garden smell if that makes sense? It‚Äôs got a chemical vibe and again this is such a shocking smell??? Like how a garden smells in space. It‚Äôs very loud and I‚Äôm like eeek but then it dries into a green mango smell that‚Äôs pretty chill? I am going to try to wear it a few times to see what I think. It might be too loud for me???? The smell of it before the dry down might make it a no.

The Vibe: Slashing the tires and breaking windows.¬†



**A sign painted peaches ‚Äî ¬†Peach nectar, sun-warmed peach skin, saffron, gardenia, ambergris, vanilla absolute, vetiver**

 Really pleasant and sweet and wearable. I feel like you could easily build on top of this scent. I really like it a lot and I think I‚Äôd like a 2ml to test it out some more as well because it has the potential to be a full size for sure. It is very nostalgic and reminds me of the drug store peach body spray I wore when I was in high school but more mature.¬†

The Vibe: Y2K party



**Good at Being Bad - ¬†¬†Dark, salted vanilla, buttercream, a swirl of honey, and a whisper of jasmine**

 Another gormound that I actually like? I think if I‚Äôm gonna like one there needs to be a salty energy to it and not overwhelming sweetness. I‚Äôm also a HUGE honey fan. It might be a little too ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù for me, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs so syrupy it feels a little heavy but I could see it cutting the acid of a citrus scent or bring some warmth to a fig or herbaceous scent. I know keep saying this but I‚Äôd love a 2ml sample to try as a spray to see a little more. I really need to stop getting samples that aren‚Äôt sprayable because it‚Äôs so hard to get the vibe.

Vibe: Seduction! Making a meal for a crush at your apartment but you want to seem more innocent than you are.¬†



**Mango Sticky Rice ‚Äî Sweet mango, coconut infused rice and toasted sesame.**  
Sticky rice is a TOUGH note to get right. Either I like it or it‚Äôs sort of starchy baby food like? I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. The dry down is a little better but it might not be laid back enough for me to smell but idk. I just sniffed it and I don‚Äôt mind it. I CAN‚ÄôT TELL. I feel like it‚Äôs a good smell for the park?¬†

**Vibe: Hot girl walk**¬†





# Immortal Perfumes Now! 



**Georgina ‚Äî¬† a mix of Black Tea and Bergamot (ingredients of Earl Grey Tea) as well as the delicate florals of Jasmine and Lavender.**

The one scent I was most looking forward to and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. She‚Äôs great and I love that she‚Äôs not too sweet and is very syrupy and acted as a nice layering base for other perfumes with tea and lavender etc. I love it! Might full-size¬†

Vibe: Writing the next great buzz worthy novel



**La Reine Antoinette: Moss, Rose, Bergamot, Jasmine**

The thing I love about testing all of these scents is that they expose me to smells that I would have never embraced. I‚Äôve always been like ehhh Rose?! But this is really nice and light ‚Äî the brightness of the Bergamot and the Rose give it an almost candy quality? Almost like a Jolly Rancher?? It‚Äôs not sometime I‚Äôd grab for but I love it.



**Madame Mustache: Tobacco pipe, Vegan Egyptian Musk, Fire, and Vanilla.**

I don‚Äôt even know how to describe this but it‚Äôs surprising in it‚Äôs sweetness and the smoke is almost like a grandfather who smells really good but also like a cool girl at a coffee shop at the same time.¬†Very unique ‚Äî gonna try to really wear it for a full day and see how it feels. It does feel like a fancy lady too and I get campfire kind of??? Idk. Again ‚Äî loving being introduced to smells I wouldn‚Äôt reach for on my own.¬†

*Vibe: Gossiping at the bar at a high-end hotel*¬†

  


**Persephone: Ylang ylang, sweetgrass, Vegan white musk, sandalwood, and pomegranate**

Light and airy ‚Äî originally I thought that all of the scents started to feel like they were kind of this one note heaviness but there are some lighter options here and here‚Äôs one of them. I feel like Immortal Perfume is for sure more aligned with the more traditional style of perfume that‚Äôs like more of a cohesive story vs. reaching for specific scent profiles which happens a lot in indie. It‚Äôs pleasant but not as stand out as some of the others?¬† ACTUALLY NOW THAT I‚ÄôM HERE‚Ä¶The dry down is really nice.

Vibe: Garden party themed rager

We met at middle school and since we live in same place, we grow up together, even went to the same highschool, went different colleges but still keep in close contact; long story short, we always stayed together. ƒ∞ remember, even when i was a child how i always the one who breaks the ice when we got into fight. That pattern followed me all my life but just for her. ƒ∞ believed there is something to fight for, after all its a once in a lifetime chance to have a friendship that got older with you. You just need to put effort, sometimes bit your tongue and sometimes go quiet and remind yourself all the times they treated you so fucking right. 

She had a lot of toxic relationships and i was there. You never make them give up, they just had to go and take the damage. You just cant turn them away but you try untill they come crying and you just be there. ƒ∞ was there. But this time she didnt even wanted my forgiveness nor my existence. 

ƒ∞t all started when she deleted her insta. ƒ∞ messeged her, she said she just dont want it anymore and i was like cool, its draining anyway. Then days later, she text me, wants me to send her our personal insta chat, spesifically the ones where she mentioned any man. She says she gave her insta to her boyfriend, he went and read our messages, then told her he found ‚Äòsomething‚Äô like a prick which HE ƒ∞S. And my friend is desperatly  searching for those alleged messages. ƒ∞t was awful. ƒ∞t was all deleted because she deleted her account and then i said it was our personal messages, you shouldnt have given him the access, i really didnt like the fact that a third party read our convos.

We didnt talk for some days after that, cuz she doesnt reach out when i dont, and maybe she got offended that i rightfully stand my ground and get pissed about something that i would never do. 

Then i again, try to save this frienship that i felt in my gut, was falling apart. Not because just a one guy. Because she doesnt want to heal. But i triedvone more time for the sake of old times. ƒ∞ text her where shes at, she was at work asked why i asked, i said i was gonna invite you to my home for a coffee. She didnt text me after that, for days, until today i got a text from her, foolishly thinking oh, she is gonna say bruh, whats up like she always do and we are gonna forget all about it.

She send me a long text. Basically she wants me to know that she is not gonna talk to me because thats what her boyfriend wants and since he sacrificed a lot, she HAD TO sacrifice to. ƒ∞t was like written on gunpoint. Professional almost. Like a court order. ƒ∞ just said ‚Äúare you joking‚Äù cuz WTF that didnt even sound like the person i know for years. That didnt even sound like a person. And if it is, this was a type of person we used to make fun about. And to become such person in a week, i was like she is got kidnapped or something but one part of me kinda sense it coming so‚Ä¶ i called her. Didnt answer. Called again. Declined. 

The last thing i did was texting her sister about her well being which she still didnt reply but i can see her other sisters are posting on insta so no emergency situation i guess. ƒ∞ just needed to know that she wrote that in her own will. Then i can look back at what she done to me. My mom said thats what people do sometimes. When it comes to relationships, they show a different side of them. She is in a toxic relationship that you can smell the radiation from miles away. ƒ∞ try to talk, to be there and lastly to advide her to seek proffessional help and i cant even count many times i told her to leave his stinky ass. ƒ∞ just dont know what more i can do or do i even owe it to? Oh she is in a bad time, oh she is a toxic relationship so be gentle, be nice, be there‚Ä¶ im tired but i still did it and she didnt want me there. ƒ∞ know im right, i know i have every reason to run away, im just‚Ä¶ i guest i just needed to vent. ƒ∞ never thought that will happen to me. Thankfully im not alone, im in my social era, made friends that are good for me but i feel like a part of me is missing and i dont feel as comfortable around them as i was with her. ƒ∞ will try to take care of myself from now on. Even in a situationshop like this i doubt myself. Am i playing the victim? What about her sacrifices? Maybe i was too hard on her? Maybe i should called 3 times not 2? ƒ∞t a legacy my family gave me. ƒ∞ cant even trust my own brain but i can trust the pain that it gaves me. ƒ∞ know how much that make me cry and im a human to, i dont deserve this. No one does. 

So yeah. Thanks for reading. ƒ∞ just need to assure myself that everything is gonna be alright with our without my best friend.",1,1737582388.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I've gotten 2 sample packs, though I'm not done working through them. The first was a mixed bag and I wasn't sure how I felt about the house, but I was intrigued enough by the winter releases to go for a second. 

Having tried several more scents, I've ended up being really impressed. There's a certain dry throughline texture that I enjoy, and most of the scents feel unique, even exciting. I also love that these are EDPs, and that the samples are a generous 1.7 mL. Super fast turn around, nice manageable catalog. I'm def looking forward to trying my remaining samples. Would recommend!

**‚ùÑÔ∏èWinter scents leaving at the end of January (both FS contenders for me):**

**1993** (*snow cream, fresh pine, trails of smoke from a chimney*)

* One of the best winter air scents I've tried - there's something both cold and warm to it. The pine and woodsmoke and something a touch menthol-y create a lovely forest chill while the vanilla and cream plus wood have me bundled up inside. The snowy slightly smoky air and sweet cream balance very well. The chilly pine drops out first around 30 min, but the wisp of woodsmoke persists over a deeper creamy vanilla. After 3ish hrs the smoke is mostly gone and the dry down reminds me of a spot on white chocolate, or even a cookies and cream chocolate bar. Almost too gourmand for me, but I really love this one. **9/10, nostalgic and mouthwatering**

**Apple Stack Cake** (*apples, ginger, cake, grandma‚Äôs kitchen  {not vegan//contains butter C02}*	)

* There's a fresh, cidery apple with a hit of cinnamon and what feels like a very similar woodsmoke to 1993. I don't tend to like fruity scents too much but this is kinda fun, and the spice is well balanced. The vanilla comes out more over the first hour, and this reminds me of my own family's version: sauteed cinnamon apple slices over pancakes, the apples still a little snappy in the center. The woody and slight smoke notes go between background and main cast. At 2 or 3 hrs the cake juuust appears, forming from the non-apple notes to make something just recognizable but still a bit of a fantasy, like a good memory rather than photorealism. This filled up my car and stayed there while I ran errands. It continued to dry down into something so cozy, apple-sweet vanilla with a hint of wood and spice. **8.5/10, really excellent gourmand apple if quite seasonal**

**ü™µFall scents that might be gone already?? idk**

**Wild as a Mink** (*spicy ginger, warm animal musk, sheer woods, vanilla*)		

* Yummm okay this opens heavy black pepper for me, with a smokey dry wood underneath. I don't get ginger or vanilla up top, bit I do like this one.After 15 min or so the vanilla starts picking up, just a little, and with that dry peppery wood?? Yes please. Not the strongest but this settles into a sweet wood that I definitely enjoy. It reminds me of this alcohol I had once with tasting notes of driftwood, salt, and pepper - not the alcohol part at all, but the nature of the woodiness. This actually lasts a really long time, with a dry airy texture I really like and a versatile scent. **8.5/10, very enjoyable dry vanilla woods (bought a FS of this one)**

**1998** (*warm spices, pumpkin, a touch of marigold, golden amber, the orange glow of campfire embers*)

* Definitely getting cardamom, ginger, some caramel sweetness and maybe a bit of dry light wood. Definitely not a pumpkin spice vibe to me, more like a cardamom bun in an old bake shop (not literally). The cardamom and spices fade and I think it's the amber that takes over, along with something like dried fruit that I can't put my finger on. Very sweet, pretty one-note. I think this only lasted \~2.5 or 3 hrs, quite a short lifespan for my liking. **4/10, nice opening but turned pretty basic**

**Neyland** (*whiskey with a twist of orange, a worn leather jacket, an unlit cigar, cedarwood*)

* Definitely whiskey but this is also sweet and creamy in a way I didn't expect! Against my skin there's leather and the sharp haze of whiskey, but in the air it's like a whiskey-caramel ice cream almost. I'm not getting wood, and if there's orange it's lending to the caramel sensation. The creaminess tones down but the whiskey stays gourmand, very good. Soft after 2ish hrs :( but stayed as a skin scent all day. I didn't get whiffs very often which is sad bc I would really like to smell this!! **8/10, surprisingly sweet and sexy-snuggly**

**üåπWhat I Believe To Be GC**

**Candoro Marble** (*smooth sandalwood, aged peppermint, rose*)

* Very rose-heavy, and with the mint this smells just like a decorative hand soap :( I am transported to my aunt's lace-encased guest bathroom, white and frilly with old-fashioned rose-print wallpaper. Still reminded of soap, the rose diminishes a bit to be more even with the mint but such a clean scent. This lasted pretty much all day, which was a little overwhelming for me. **3/10, mini hand soap is not the vibe for me**

**Hodges** (*forgotten books, vanilla, orris, sheer woods*)

* Well, paper scents are not for me! I think this is a bit too literal. I ended up spraying some other vanilla perfumes on within 30 minutes because I just didn't want to smell like paper for any longer. If you do, I'd give this a go but I had hoped the other notes would round this out to make a more nuanced perfume.

So, after years of nespressoing I am finally taking the step towards an espresso machine. 
I really would like to be able to make a somewhat good espresso and cappuccino. However, my girlfriend mostly drinks americanos, this makes it a little complicated. 
If it was just for me, I would choose something to tinker and modify like a gaggia pro or a silvia. However, things need to be simpler for the whole family to use and I really don‚Äôt want a full automatic.

So what I am looking for:
- semi-automatic espresso machine
- able to boil water to turn espresso into americano
- quick heat up for quick shots and quick cappuccino


I think the Sage bambino ticks most of these boxes. However, I have read Sage machines don‚Äôt last forever. Are there any alternatives? I would like to spend <1000 euro in the Netherlands for an espresso machine + grinder I would also use for slow-drip filter-coffee. 

For a grinder I am looking at a DF64 or a Eureka Mignon. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",1,1737582071.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Tell me which places you avoid giving your business to, it could be for any reason, reasonable or not. 

Just looking to add to my list and have a bit of a vent and some silliness in these gloomy times

I‚Äôm not going to shit on small family-run restaurants because I didn‚Äôt like the food though, these are mostly the bigger restauration groups but feel free to add your own.


Here‚Äôs mine:
- Cheskie‚Äôs (see the post this morning, very vocal trump supporters)
- La St-Bock (stfu stp!! I feel like there is a new TVA/ JDM article every month where this dude is pictured with a sad face and crossed arms)
- That unhinged restaurant that threatened to sue for bad reviews (the only time I‚Äôm in Longueuil is to drive through it anyways)
- Abreuvoir (The waitress called me a scammer and accused me of giving her a fake 10$?? (this was back in the day when I carried cash and things cost 10$) She made such a public fuss too!)
- Tims (They rejected me back when I was a teen because I refused to do shifts during school hours lol also the coffee sucks)
- Mandy‚Äôs (the owner hosted Pierre Poli√®vre yesterday, and i refuse to pay for overpriced salad)
- A5 group (Nhau bar, H√†, Flyjin, Gypsy, Kampai, Apt 200, etc) (I hate how these white dudes use Asian cultures as a theme/decor but have zero respect for the culture itself like a Bali themed restaurant named Gypsy??)
- Jegantic (Hang, Yoko Luna, etc ) (Same as above, Yoko Luna used to be named Geisha but they had so much backlash so they had to rebrand)
- MTLblog/Narcity
- Bell
- Fido (I was overpaying, I switched providers, they called me for two weeks, I finally pick up, they hang up on me??)
- Fido but specifically Pierre at Fido St-Denis (I never stepped foot in that store and this man kept on texting me!!)
- Royal Le Page (A broker started randomly emailing my personal email unsolicited to get clients, like have you heard of anti-spam laws and how did you get my email)
- Sergakis 
- French Tacos (Why are there so many?? Who keeps buying these?? Why are they called a taco??)
- Columbus Cafe (another thing the French are bad at!! this is based on the barista's recommendation and I ended up spending 6$ on a drink that tasted like soy sauce)
- idk if it still exists anymore but there was this ""pizza"" place right next to the Pharmaprix on Mont-royal/St-Laurent and it was legit a pita with tomato sauce and shredded cheese and it took forever to make 0/10.
- Kuto comptoir √† tartares (simplement pas bon)

Soft boycott because I sometimes go in a pinch:
- Couche-tard (ik its a quebecois gem and maybe i would go if they had stuff like 7-11 but its so expensive and if I‚Äôm overpaying for my little drink, I‚Äôd rather give my money to the uncle spending his sunday mornings restocking his dep at Costco)
- Loblaws etc (Fuck Galen Weston)
- Indigo (Why do I have so many giftcards? Montreal has so many local bookstores plus we have good secondhand ones too)
- Cinemas Guzzo (Why is it still cash only? I feel like the owner has added every Montrealer on Linkedin at this point)
- Tres Amigos (if you see me there, I didn't go willingly!! there is so much better mexican food in Montreal, the only thing this place is good for is the location and for large groups)
- Village des valeurs (their #1 valeur is to get as much money from you. Why is it so expensive for stuff they receive for free?? Their prices were overpriced pre-covid btw. I'm talking like 30-40$ for items just because they're branded)

Ok thats it for now, I realize I am indeed a hater and am maybe chronically online but my memory is strong and my spite is infinite. 

Let me know which places personally offended you! Tell me your petty drama!! I want to hate with you <3 (If you are that longueuil restaurant pls dont sue me thx)",19,1737582003.0,montreal,26,0.67,False

I've been done that myself before. The reasons behind this behavior vary‚Äîsome experience post-nut clarity, others simply lose interest, and some may feel guilty about their spending. There are likely many more reasons, but that's not the focus of this post.

This led me to question how subs can fulfill their need for a findom connections and a D/s dynamic without letting down dommes who invest significant time and emotional energy into the relationship.

I came to the conclusion that such subs might benefit from finding a domme (or several) they enjoy sending to on occasion, while also maintaining casual conversations if they wish, sort of like a domme's aqcuaintance. For instance, you could be a domme's occasional 'coffee sub,' showing up now and then to bring her joy‚Äîor, if financial draining is your preference, that‚Äôs an option too. This way, you can stay in touch with the dommes you like without feeling the pressure to justify yourself if you take a break or decide to step away entirely. At the same time, it spares dommes unnecessary frustration.

1i7mmi9,https://i.redd.it/ou1376l76mee1.jpeg,Strange meat in car,"So this is incredibly weird and extremely unsettling I can‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm still thinking a lot about this.

For some context, the last couple of days we‚Äôve been in a freeze; temperatures had dropped down to around 17¬∞F, but we‚Äôve maintained temperatures around 20¬∞F to 30¬∞F all of January. For about a week or so, I had noticed that my car had been emitting a stale but sweet smell. It wasn‚Äôt bad, and in all honesty, I brushed it off as something my dog had opened or even an old coffee cup I had in the console. I‚Äôm a little bit messy, so I had assumed I had spilled something sweet in my car that I hadn‚Äôt realized. 

Anyway, yesterday I was headed to dinner with my boyfriend, my roommate, and her partner. I was planning on leaving early so I could go to my boyfriend‚Äôs workplace, which is right next to a burger place my roommate really wanted to try. As I attempted to head over to his workplace, so we could hang out for maybe 30 minutes before his shift ended and maybe talk a little, I realized I had lost my wallet. I often misplace it, and I assumed it was in my car. I went to my car, turned on the engine, and looked in the middle compartment. I wasn‚Äôt able to find it, so I looked in the glove box. There, in my glove box, was a chunk of raw meat. It took up my entire glove box, and it was just in there, no wrapping‚Äîlike someone had grabbed a pork roast from its packaging, opened my car door and glove box, and just placed it there and left. I was in shock and a little lost as to what I should do, but I called my roommate and her boyfriend to come over and inspect it with me as I called the cops to file a report. I also called my apartment manager to see if anyone had reported meat being left in people‚Äôs cars, but they had no clue what I was talking about. When the police arrived and inspected the meat, they suggested that it might be someone who was angry at me and wanted to make my car stink, especially since my air filter is located in the glove box. I had only my boyfriend, my roommate, and her boyfriend in my car, and they all say they have no clue how the meat ended up there.

I have also broken my car key recently so sometimes my doors don‚Äôt lock fully, I have a very distinguishable car, think like all pink interior and rhinestones. I‚Äôm not very sociable and I only frequent my apartment, work and school. It‚Äôs extremely unnerving having to think that someone invaded my privacy, took no valuables just to leave a thing of meat in a place I wouldn‚Äôt really look. I don‚Äôt know if I should react as if it‚Äôs a threat or not or even as a joke. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äù3 woman, idk why this unsettled me so much.

1i7mgyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1i7mgyr/can_anyone_point_me_toward_resources_in_nyc_to/,"Can anyone point me toward resources in NYC to help people with mental illness, specifically schizophrenia?","Hello,

I am female in my mid twenties and I have schizophrenia. I have lived in New York City for 10 years. I was diagnosed 3 years ago after I had a long lasting psychotic episode and had to go through inpatient. I am now medicated and living on my own. I am still struggling every day albeit I am much more functional than I used to be, and not a danger to myself. 

I feel like my life is ruined. I went to a design school here and was supposed to graduate in 2022 however I had major mental struggles in my last semester. I was not able to receive my diploma because I have 2 credits outstanding. The school is expensive so I cannot afford to enroll again to finish those 2 credits yet. It is a few thousand dollars per credit hour. This has affected my self esteem in a huge way.  

When I was in school, before my diagnosis, I felt like I was a different person. Finding motivation was easy for me and I completed 3 different internships. I worked part time jobs, was social, had income, and was excited about my future. I had good relationships with my professors and had a professional network I could reach out to.

Fast forward to now, and I have no one. My professors stayed in contact with students who reach out to them and attend their professional events. This is really hard for me and I feel distant from a lot of my former classmates because of my condition, I would sometimes not be in class and I was not able to build relationships with them. 
My last corporate job in my industry was right around Covid lockdown, and I was laid off. Around a half a year after that, I started having serious issues that caused me to have to go to an inpatient program, which is where I received my diagnosis. Ever since I finished my program and found the medication/therapy/everything that can help me function, I have been unable to find work in my industry. Where I have been able to work, I‚Äôve been places such as a food truck, fast food, retail, and working as a home aide (not a medical aide, I helped a woman who was physically disabled shop for groceries, etc). I make barely anything. My electricity bill is late and so is my gas. I have a hard time holding down the job for more than six months, and I feel unable to develop relationships with the people I work with or for. Therefore, I have no professional network. It‚Äôs been years since I have spoken to the people in my professional network, and I have tried reaching out to some of them in the past to have coffee and catch up. I have not received a reply from anyone. 

I want to mention that my condition has never caused me to act in a violent or aggressive way towards anybody. It results in traumatic hallucinations, both visual and auditory, that caused me to behave oddly from the outside perspective. I suffer from delusions and a lot of them are fear-based. It has resulted in me having to take time off for appointments and recovery, which has made me a less favored employee in all of my jobs due to my needs. I think I come across as very reserved and quiet. I wasn‚Äôt always this way, but I feel like my experience as a schizophrenic person have fundamentally changed me. 

This is the most I have really talked to anybody about these things. I‚Äôm feeling other than my therapist and my parents. My parents are not much help. I think my last straw today was that I went to a hotel open call with my r√©sum√©. I showed up 15 minutes early. I waited for over an hour, and the hotel staff chose only two people out of a group of 30 to interview at random, with no care for who arrived first or in what order we were waiting. I walked away feeling defeated, invisible, and like I will never be able to change my situation. I want to do better for myself in so many different ways. This is hurting me immensely, and I am struggling every day because of it. I am starting to fear what will happen if I cannot afford to pay my rent or my medication. I have no savings. I am frugal and do not eat out because of my social issues (I do not like being in restaurants because when I was experiencing psychosis it looked like everyone was staring at me and talking about me, and I am not recovered yet from these experiences because they were so scary, since I did not understand what was happening to me).

I‚Äôm currently on my parents insurance, however, at the end of this month, I will be 26 and I will no longer be insured. My medication is over $1000 without insurance. I take a medication that does not have a generic version, only a namebrand. It‚Äôs relatively new. My doctor specifically prescribes me this medication over any other. It was so hard to get my insurance to cover this medication. I had to go through three different other medications, I had adverse documented reactions to all of them, and that‚Äôs the only reason why my insurance covered this medication. I take this medication because some of the side effects from the other medications can trigger some of my comorbid mental health issues (anorexia) that will compound on themselves and make my life even worse.

I was looking at the New York marketplace for insurance and it just made me feel sick to my stomach. I am unemployed and I have nothing in my bank account. I feel like I have created a dead end life for myself. I feel like I only have so much time before everything catches up to me and my life implodes before my eyes. Schizophrenia carries a huge stigma‚Ä¶ in my opinion, even more so than most of the other mental illnesses that people have. I was told by my parents that I should not share my condition with other people because of what they might say or it could scare them. 

I guess my question is this, does anybody know of any resources I could go to in the city for people who have schizophrenia? Are there any foundations or charities? My ideal world would be I could work in a program like that to help other people who have the same issues that I did. I technically qualify for disability however, my dad discourages me from applying, saying that the stipulations would make my life harder rather than easier. I realize now my parents don‚Äôt provide me any help aside from verbal niceties, so maybe it would be pertinent for me to apply for disability, despite what he says? Are there anybody else in this subreddit who has schizophrenia and lives in the city, who is living a functional life? Is there any knowledge you learned that along your way that you could impart to me? I feel like there is a lot of support for people who have depression, anxiety, other issues aside from schizophrenia. The only time I ever see people talking about schizophrenia is when they are talking about the unhoused people in our city and how scary they are. We‚Äôre talking about somebody who is on the street yelling things in coherently. I understand because schizophrenia is absolutely scary. But we are so much more than that. I guess I am hoping that someone here has been through something similar and has come back out the other side. Your insight would be so meaningful to me. Every day I feel like I am getting closer to letting go of reality to fall into that dark comfy hole and I need help. ",14,1737581215.0,AskNYC,7,0.94,False

Whether that‚Äôs my fault or theirs or a mix, idk. Im speaking from my perspective and I have memories of them really hurting me. I wasn‚Äôt self conscious until they picked at my face, weight, and more. 

So naturally I gravitated towards friends. I went from being on curfew to having some more freedom, which was a curfew of 6pm when I was aged 14-16. But I really did way more those ages than currently. I went biking with my friends, concerts, picnics, explored the general area and was hardly at home. I mean we biked to the city and spent all day there. I had a few friends who were a bit more ‚Äûwild,, by parent standards and they‚Äôd want to go to parties, or hang out late. 

I didn‚Äôt go away for college and many connections faded. The best friends I related to and did book club, movie night, coffee days, etc... they changed 
And I think I was maybe too lame or like they had better friends so they stopped replying. 

My acquaintance invited me to her birthday, I don‚Äôt know her well but we hung out once. She asked me if I flirted with a guy she knew and mind you I don‚Äôt have friends so I didn‚Äôt even know the guy. Because of that interaction I figured maybe I shouldn‚Äôt go to her birthday. She also invited my old best friend. I‚Äôve been doing this for years even before I got more anxious in my comfort zone. 

My high school best friend invited me to her birthday but the same day which it was set. So I said I didn‚Äôt have enough notice because she lived quite far. And we sort of fell out overtime and she ghosted me. I don‚Äôt want to be a victim or self pity but I worry I drive people away.

My former best friend who‚Äôs going to the other girls party I noticed that I was always asking her to hang out and she didn‚Äôt. She acted bothered. I hate feeling ignored so I stopped asking. We talked years later and then stopped talking again. It all just confuses me and idk. When we hung out she talked about the guy she was engaged to and all her wild party days.
I realized some of that intersected when she stopped speaking to me. I used to relate to so many friends but I guess they see me as immature?
I guess by ‚Äömissing opportunity, I mean am I denying hang outs/ not reaching out enough? Should I do more?

Sorry this is long. I reconnected with some old friends because it‚Äôs my goal to at least try. And one friend was shocked I never had a boyfriend/ don‚Äôt want one. Now I spiral and feel like I‚Äôm seriously behind everyone. I had a first date last year and nearly threw up. My online friend has to help and she said ok.. maybe no dating for now.

Here are my biggest questions (Spoilers),"So I just finished this book and I absolutely loved it. After going through a couple of years of not reading novels as consistently as I used to, this book is the first in a long time to keep me glued in. It is also such a great example of an unreliable narrator.
Also apologies if this is a common post, I am new to the subreddit and just was to start a debate. These are the biggest questions I have.

What actually happened that night at the bacchanal  especially with Camilla? Why was she the most traumatised and soaked in blood?
On the same topic (and this just might be due to my lack of knowledge for Greek history) but when Richard refers to the bacchanal as a sex ritual with Henry agreeing, why was he not more alarmed??? It just gets brushed over. This is basically Henry admitting there was at least one orgy with the entire group including people who are literally related.

If Camilla and Charles did hook up with as many people as Francis said, why did they not have sex with Richard. Especially when Richard showed a keen interest for Camilla.

I don‚Äôt think Bunny was as a terrible person as Richard tries to convince. But let‚Äôs say he was, why was Henry so keen on him and kept offering money (Francis also doing the same)?

Was it actually Henry physically abusing Camilla? Why would she think he was going to shoot her?

What was Charles and Camilla‚Äôs argument about?

Was Charles and Camilla‚Äôs relationship fully consensual? Something that stood out to me a lot was after the ‚Äúnot so brotherly kiss‚Äù, Camilla puts sugar in her coffee. This is something that she doesn‚Äôt do as noted by Richard.

 What happened between Bunny and Camilla. At the start of the book he agrees with Richard and calls her attractive (there is also a likely chance they had sex during the bacchanal). However later on, Bunny shows disgust at the idea of having sex with her.

Was Henry trying to set up Richard as the suspect? And why was he going to give Richard his car??

Was Henry disappearing during the fbi investigation actually to do the extra interviews or was he scheming something else?

Why did Charles end up being such a bad alcoholic. It couldn‚Äôt have just been stress.

And why was Richard so passive about everything?

Everyone must have known about the incest including Julian so why were they so calm about it?

When first introduced to the story, Julian and his classes seemed to play a large role. However after a third into the book, he was rarely mentioned and his interactions with the other characters were not hugely profound. Why then at the end did Richard and Henry talk about Julian as if he was one of the most important figures in their life? 

Edit: This one I nearly forgot and is the most important to me. What was written in Bunny‚Äôs letter?? What else did he accuse the group of doing??

1i7mbl5,https://i.redd.it/gfct7exx3mee1.jpeg,Strange meat in my car,"So this is incredibly weird and extremely unsettling I can‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm still thinking a lot about this.

For some context, the last couple of days we‚Äôve been in a freeze; temperatures had dropped down to around 17¬∞F, but we‚Äôve maintained temperatures around 20¬∞F to 30¬∞F all of January. For about a week or so, I had noticed that my car had been emitting a stale but sweet smell. It wasn‚Äôt bad, and in all honesty, I brushed it off as something my dog had opened or even an old coffee cup I had in the console. I‚Äôm a little bit messy, so I had assumed I had spilled something sweet in my car that I hadn‚Äôt realized. 

Anyway, yesterday I was headed to dinner with my boyfriend, my roommate, and her partner. I was planning on leaving early so I could go to my boyfriend‚Äôs workplace, which is right next to a burger place my roommate really wanted to try. As I attempted to head over to his workplace, so we could hang out for maybe 30 minutes before his shift ended and maybe talk a little, I realized I had lost my wallet. I often misplace it, and I assumed it was in my car. I went to my car, turned on the engine, and looked in the middle compartment. I wasn‚Äôt able to find it, so I looked in the glove box. There, in my glove box, was a chunk of raw meat. It took up my entire glove box, and it was just in there, no wrapping‚Äîlike someone had grabbed a pork roast from its packaging, opened my car door and glove box, and just placed it there and left. I was in shock and a little lost as to what I should do, but I called my roommate and her boyfriend to come over and inspect it with me as I called the cops to file a report. I also called my apartment manager to see if anyone had reported meat being left in people‚Äôs cars, but they had no clue what I was talking about. When the police arrived and inspected the meat, they suggested that it might be someone who was angry at me and wanted to make my car stink, especially since my air filter is located in the glove box. I had only my boyfriend, my roommate, and her boyfriend in my car, and they all say they have no clue how the meat ended up there.

I have also broken my car key recently so sometimes my doors don‚Äôt lock fully, I have a very distinguishable car, think like all pink interior and rhinestones. I‚Äôm not very sociable and I only frequent my apartment, work and school. It‚Äôs extremely unnerving having to think that someone invaded my privacy, took no valuables just to leave a thing of meat in a place I wouldn‚Äôt really look. I don‚Äôt know if I should react as if it‚Äôs a threat or not or even as a joke. I‚Äôm a 5‚Äù3 woman, idk why this unsettled me so much.

I'm just reaching out to see if there's any tips or things that you do to help with the pain of Interstitial cystitis? 

I've looked into and I have started reducing common food triggers; one of the things I'm finding most difficult is the majority of my diet is essentially made up of food triggers of Interstitial cystitis. I have daily chronic migraines, and other forms of chronic pain and as a result already have a reduced diet. 

The other thing that I'm finding difficult is avoiding coffee especially because I'm a barista. I've started having matcha instead; and am planning to buy low acidity coffee and cold brew it.

I'm currently on myrbetriq because I have overactive bladder (from birth, born premature); and I'm already on amitriptyline for migraines. I was also on detrol for years; but unaware of the long-term effects of the medication. Because my pain is so severe my urologist told me to go back on detrol temporarily at the same time as my other medications. We also have a scope scheduled in about a month. I'm somewhat worried about getting the scope only because in the past I've had very severe bladder spasms with Scopes or catheters; which is the most severe pain I've ever had in my life (which says something because I have Chronic Cluster Headaches about 2-3 times per week currently). Have any of you had anything like that? This is also the first time I've had something like this under local anesthetic; I've been had 9 surgeries including Ureteroscopy & Bladder Hydro distension 5 times (every 4 years growing up until I was 20).

I know that there's a lot of medications on the market; however from the information my urologist gave me; he said the majority of medications that are specific to the bladder might not work because my inflammation may be impacting organs surrounding the bladder as well. We think that's the case because I went to emergency thinking I had a severe UTI infection or potential kidney infection. 

I've had pain from what is likely Interstitial cystitis for about 12 years now since I was 18; however I was on detrol which seemed to work. When the effectiveness wore off, I asked to go to a urologist so we could figure out what options I had. I'd already been on Myrbetriq when I was 18 but it didn't work on the pain; it only alleviated overactive bladder symptoms. The doctor I saw switched me to Myrbetriq but at a dose of 50mg (I was on 25mg when I was younger). I also had quite a bit of pain that I believed was related to PCOS, which we realized wasn't the case after I had a total hysterectomy (which was medically necessary anyways).

I've also been using medical cannabis (Canadian) for 9 years now; and found that CBG specifically was extremely helpful at managing my pain. It's helping but it's much more severe now than it has been. In the past it was short bursts of severe pain; now it's constant with pain that spikes.

How does it work for you? How do you make it work with a partner?

I wrote most of this over several days, and picked it up today, when she broke up with me. Since im 'too ill'. 
So i guess its a solo life for the rest then. 


It seems very difficult for many of us who have a SZ related diagnosis, to actually function with a partner. If that partner is not extremely understanding. And able to cope with the Paranoia, the delusions, and up/down mood. And rest of the crap cooking in our heads. 


I have seen this woman for some time(5'ish months), thats 4 months more than anyone else in the past what, 8-10years. Iv spent most of my time alone. Some time with friends, and volunteer at the local Mental Health institution. 

I swear that this woman i have been seeing has a good heart. And is a good influence in the world. Much better than me. She has taken an education, despite being a foreigner. She is resourceful and smart.
But she as anyone else also has her burdens to carry. She have had a tough upbringing, and some very bad experiences.

She has been a very positive influence, to my life, in many many ways.

But. I have my problems. I try to tell her some of them, so that i can get them off my chest, so that she knows that this crap is actually cooking in my head. But its hard for her. And i frequently just 'shut down/flatline/stress out' whatever, when we misunderstand one another. 

If we have a misunderstanding, i smell worse in just an afternoon sitting with mental chaos, than a week without a shower. Its insane. I dont get it. Constant sweat from my armpits. And its a quite harsh smell.

I dont run away to a screen, to stop thinking, or avoid conversation, except if i get a message from someone i know, or my kids. 
I try to read something, either on my kindle, or in paper format. And i use a marker for interesting bits. Not that i remember them anyways. I knit. I draw. I use nicotine(vape) and coffee. Because she has asthma, i open a window or door and blow out the smoke when im with her. And we have been together A LOT. 

So i try to be open. Tell her some of what is happening and not happening inside of me. 
And we are still barely scratching the surface. She is finding it very difficult to cope with how 'broken' i am. 

I dont tell her that i suspect she is sent out to monitor me, iv had that in my head for 5 months. To check on me. That she spies on me. That she puts things in places to see how i react. Drops stuff on the floor. And that I think that she tricks me with words sometimes. And that she jokes about my memory. I dont tell her about the delusions/or not, that there are cameras monitoring around. That people are watching. How nothing is a coincidence. Like everything that happens is meant to happen. 

Still, while keeping most under the lid. Just waiting for it to pass. Go away. 
I still scare her off. She thinks i dont care. I do. But i mean, what the hell of what goes on in my head, should i even pay attention to. 
I just dont trust my own judgment or perception.

Iv made many improvements in regards to physical health. And food.
Have lots of pains, cant sit without support pillows anywhere cause of my back. In the evening sometimes i cant even hold my Kindle to read, because of the pains in my wrists/hands. 
But i do simple workouts. Routinely. Every day. And gradually have become physically more fit. 
But it does not carry over to my mental health. 

I eat healthy, sometimes some snacks. I take my meds in the evening. I dont drink. I dont smoke. I shower. I shave. I cut my hair. Change underwear and socks. I clean. I vacuum. Wash my clothes. 
I try to incorporate what I hear, into improving on myself. To become somewhat better. Or as good as i can, with this nightmare inside.


Im on the verge of just giving up the relationship thou. I cant be there in the way that i should be. In the way that a partner should. And im afraid that i am wasting her time. 
She has also told me i am asexual. Which is probably very true. Also i forget things. A lot. And i become uncertain/confused.
I also struggle with not noticing things, like other peoples bodily appearance. Social hints and queues. I dont notice if something is 'unusual', if someone is pregnant(unless its extremely obvious). Or like a week ago, a man i met a few years ago on the Mental Health Institution, last week i noticed for the first time, that his left arm was amputated in the middle between the elbow and wrist. If someone gains 10-20kg, i dont really notice that either. Its been like this all my life. Change in haircut. Change in haircolor. Change of clothing. 

Iv told her that i have applied for a new therapist. And I have, but its probably not going to help, again. Its just going to be another therapist that i cant talk to. Iv tried all the meds i can. 

I am on 'medical benefits', or whatever its called when you are sick, and the Goverment supports me so that I dont live on the street. 
I have a Guardian in regards to Finances. And to make sure that i dont just make bad decisions and give everything i have away on a whim.

We had a pretty mutual split as there were things for both of us that just weren‚Äôt working. It wasn‚Äôt due to a loss of love; we just didn‚Äôt have great communication. I was willing to try and fix things but he was more stubborn and said we had our answer in front of us. 

  After not speaking for a few months with the exception of one check in where he asked how I was doing, he texted me one day: ‚ÄúTotally fine if you don‚Äôt want to but was gonna ask if you wanted to get coffee or something when I‚Äôm back / maybe in the new year if December is too busy. If I‚Äôm being totally honest I really don‚Äôt like not having you in my life hah üòÖ.‚Äù 

  This brought back a lot of emotion for me and made me realize I definitely was not fully over him. I decided to meet up with him for drinks and we had a nice time but never brought up the past relationship or intentions. We just caught up and it was lighthearted. It made me realize how much I missed him and truly valued my time with him. 

  A few weeks after this I decided to just reach out directly to see where his head was at. I said: ‚ÄúReally glad we got to catch up the other night. To be honest, I had been really missing having you in my life, and when you texted me last month, I wasn‚Äôt sure where your head was at. Just want to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page. Totally cool if you‚Äôd want to talk about it in person.‚Äù 

He responded to me: 
‚ÄúYeah I was really missing you too. I wanted to reach out earlier but also wanted to give you/us space. I‚Äôd really like to explore a friendship with you if possible but totally understand if that‚Äôs not possible for us rn. And yeah happy to talk about it more in person too at any point.‚Äù 

Now I‚Äôm feeling confused on his intentions/feelings. His initial text sounded emotionally charged and like he still had feelings, but after I directly asked him he just wants to explore a friendship? The wording is very vague. I honestly would love to get back with him but also understand that may not be possible. I think hearing from him when he invited me to get drinks really set me back in my healing.

But that was before technology started outpacing magic. You really got a sense of how serious this was when you saw the greatest mage of your age sitting right next to you in your thermodynamics class.","‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ are you doing here?‚Äù 
The words escaped my lips before I had a chance to consider alternative queries. The girl seated before me looked up, lilac tresses caressing a visage that, to an ordinary person, would have been enthralling with a mere glance.
The Greatest Mage of our Age, Systelline Astravos, peered up at me, as if she had not realized that she was seated in a physics and engineering lecture‚Ä¶ and not where she, to my knowledge, thrived. 
‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù she asked, voice rumbling with a certain vibrato. It was clear she had not properly prepared for an 8am lecture- there was nary a coffee cup to be found. 
Not that it earned my sympathy- not when she took that tone. It still bit me, no doubt, but it was an answer I was expecting. 
Who would remember the desperate laggard named Kaine Lygasid, the black sheep of the family?
‚ÄúI attended the Academy,‚Äù I briefly surmised a past that I had no interest in recalling. This earned me a sharp exhale from the girl, as she turned her charmed visage aside. It seemed that was answer enough for her, but my question lingered, answered. 
Before I could reiterate it, the door slammed shut. ‚ÄúSeats,‚Äù came a cutting voice, a rotund man waddling in and setting his laptop down for the lecture. I quickly snapped my head up, scanning the seats. Tanner was seated next to Bree, wincing as he caught my eye, and realized he had neglected to save me a seat amongst the packed back rows. It was too late to search- I relented, and sat where I was‚Ä¶ a seat away from the girl that was practically radiating her alien energy. 
‚ÄúThermodynamics‚Ä¶ a Intermediary Exploration,‚Äù the professor began to etch his knowledge upon the chalkboard. As much as I wished to know more about this witch and her presence, I tore up a notebook and started to write down what he had to share. 

‚ÄúSo, what are you doing here?‚Äù I asked again, as the professor snapped his laptop shut, and with harumph, dismissed our lecture. The mage‚Äôs eyes darted to my page and then to hers. 
‚ÄúStudying,‚Äù she simply answered, cold as the frosty wind that seemed to volumize her hair. At least she was still practicing her magic. Continuously. Effortlessly. I did not even see a wand in her hands, indicating a level of mastery that surpassed the need for a focus. 
‚ÄúOk, but like‚Ä¶ thermo‚Ä¶ dynamics? Do you even‚Ä¶ what would you-‚Äù 
‚ÄúAre you a mage?‚Äù she finally glanced up to me. 
‚Äú... No,‚Äù I answered, a curtly as I could. 
‚ÄúThen what business is it of yours?‚Äù 
A fair query, certainly. A few thoughts floated to mind, namely ‚Äúdid someone finally blow up the Academy?‚Äù but closely followed with ‚ÄúDid the magic bubble finally pop?‚Äù but either question had answer, I would have seen it on the SpellBook feed. 
Oh, this would have made a fantastic SpeelBook post. 
Lamenting my lost opportunity for social clout, I finally composed a reasonable answer. ‚ÄúMy sister. She looks up to you.‚Äù 
This earned me a withering look. 
‚ÄúShe‚Äôd want to know, so I figured I should get an answer before‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ tal-‚Äù 
The wand was out before I had a chance to react. The wooden tip pressed beneath my chin, my blood freezing as I recalled just how‚Ä¶ effective she had been. When we were kids. Attending the same dueling class. My hands raised in surrender as she leaned closer in, hissing in a most oppressive tone, ‚ÄúSpeak of this to anyone.‚Äù The threat made itself evident. For what she lacked in stature, she accounted for with a grave potency. Before I could answer, I felt a hand land upon my back.
‚ÄúYo Kaine, who‚Äôs this?‚Äù Tanner leaned around me, having slinked behind me for some prank of his. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt had.. The‚Ä¶‚Äù his voice began to trail off as he got a good look at Systelline. The beauty charms mages tended to use were‚Ä¶ potent outside of the environment of the Academy. Fortunately, I knew the best remedy for a man ensorcelled by the beauty of a witch. 
A sharp elbow to the solar plexus was more than enough to break him out of her spell. 
‚ÄúDrop the charms,‚Äù I warned her. ‚ÄúThe guys here aren‚Äôt used to them. Unless you want them swarming like flies the moment they get a decent look at you.‚Äù 
I never understood the obsession with fashion magic. I did understand that they had‚Ä¶ significant advantages over traditional makeup. Hair dye, for example, would actually change the color of growing hair at the roots, and rarely damage the strength of said hair. Plus, beauty charms never carried the detrimental risks of lead. But the girls at the academy always held an air of‚Ä¶ magical beauty, an ethereal quality that glossed away the details of their face, and drew the gaze naturally to their eyes. 
As Tanner coughed away the fog that her spells had cast upon his mind, the mage pulled her wand from my throat. ‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶ Sistelle,‚Äù I introduced my friend to perhaps the most promising mage of our generation. ‚ÄúWe used to‚Ä¶ go to school together.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Tanner blinked, before shaking his head. ‚ÄúTanner. Tanner Ridgemont,‚Äù he proffered his hand to her. I could understand his desperation- despite all the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù made over the past decade, there was a severe dearth of female classmates in the engineering department. 
Systeline, with a cold glower in my direction, gingerly shook his offered hand.
‚ÄúWe were going to grab some breakfast before lab,‚Äù he added, gesturing to Bree and another classmate, an Indian kid I met in passing during orientation. ‚ÄúYou wanna join?‚Äù His eyes were upon the talented sage, but I answered him nonetheless.
‚ÄúSure man, let‚Äôs go,‚Äù I started to turn away, shoving my notebook back in my bag, swinging it over my shoulder. Tanner blinked, as if shocked that I was the one answering. 
‚ÄúAh, yeah, right,‚Äù Tanner stammered, before pulling his hand away from the mage. 
We started to step away, and I did my best not to think too much about her-
‚ÄúYou want to come with?‚Äù Tanner‚Äôs voice cut in. I twisted, but it was too late. Systelline, perhaps caught off guard by the sudden invite, was already halfway into a nod before I tried to cut it off. 

Breakfast with Systelline Astravos was never an option on my bucket list bingo card, but nonetheless, it was crossed off. The idea that I would be seated across from her, while she sipped a cup of subpar coffee and bit into a donut had never crossed my mind before. Yet there she was, deep in the cesspit of world that I considered my own, acting as if there were nothing strange about magical royalty munch with the dregs, while the Indian classmate to my left was discussing computer models with Bree, and Tanner just sitting, stunned and lost as the realm of computer modeling violated his threshold. He looked to me from the far side of his table, as if begging for me to liberate him from this fresh hell of confusion, but too bad for him. 
I actually took the computational models course he worked like hell to dodge. I even got a solid A for my efforts. 
‚ÄúStop staring,‚Äù Systelline muttered beneath her breath as her hands danced about the glazed pastry in front of her. 
I had not been staring until that point, but once she voiced her discomfort, I could help but observe the chaotic confusion unfolding before me. Her fingers struggled to find a place to hold the pastry, most likely trying to avoid getting her digits covered in syrup sugar. I did not even bother to wipe the smile on my lips.
Did it earn me a sharp kick to my shin? Absolutely. 
Do I regret it? Absolutely not. 
‚ÄúSo uh, how do you two know each other?‚Äù Tanner cut through the technical discussion, attempting to draw attention to our side of the table. 
‚ÄúWe went to school together,‚Äù I was quick to answer, before she had a chance to answer.
From the corner of my eye, I could see a wry smile forming on her lips. What had she noticed? What did I let slip? Did she pick up on something? 
‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù her voice reverberated with a threatening purr. ‚ÄúThe Academy, right?‚Äù she added. 
Oh no.
‚ÄúYeah, yeah the Academy of the‚Ä¶ Arts.‚Äù 
‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶ Arts.‚Äù 
Tanner‚Äôs eyes did a dance of their own. ‚ÄúOh, Kaine, didn‚Äôt know you were into Art,‚Äù Bree cut in.
‚ÄúWell, we all need‚Ä¶ hobbies.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou still do it? Art?‚Äù 
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, all the time,‚Äù I stammered, my cheeks coloring a bit. 
‚ÄúDo you have an insta?‚Äù she began to reach for her phone. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt post much,‚Äù I could feel it. The focus was shifting towards me. But then an idea formed in my head, and my tongue began to move-
‚ÄúOh yeah, I remember. He was really good,‚Äù Systelline groused, the malicious glint in her eye communicating all I needed to know. Oh, she knew. And she was going to abuse it. 
‚ÄúDude, seriously?‚Äù Tanner beamed, as if discovering a secret he had always been digging for. Ever since the undergrad days, I had hung out with him from time to time, never really unveiling where I came from. It did not matter, to my understanding, where I came from, so long as I knew where I was going. ‚ÄúEight years, and I never saw you pick up a brush.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ draw. Mostly ink stuff,‚Äù I stammered. 
‚ÄúOh, that explains the quill!‚Äù 
I could feel the blood rush to my cheeks. The one artifact I still carried with me was now fodder in the arsenal of my greatest opponent- social pressure. 
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ guess it just‚Ä¶ never came up,‚Äù I attempted to distract from the subject shift. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs more a hobby now anyways.‚Äù
‚ÄúDude, at least you have one,‚Äù the Indian student cut in there and then. ‚ÄúThis shit gets rough without them.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat sort of feather are you using?‚Äù Systelline refused to let go. She found a pressure point, and she was going to dig the blade in. ‚ÄúHawk?‚Äù 
‚ÄúI mean, feathered quills aren‚Äôt all that different-‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an owl feather. Like a great big owl one,‚Äù Tanner exclaimed. My eyes darted to Systelline, before she slowly turned to me. The petty smile on her lips stoked the fire of rage that was boiling my veins. But I was not taking her taunting lying down. 
‚ÄúI actually looked it up,‚Äù Tanner drawled in, ‚ÄúApparently its from an Eagle-Owl-‚Äù
‚ÄúSo, Sistelle, what brings you to Drevel University?‚Äù I asked aloud. ‚ÄúCertainly wasn‚Äôt the food,‚Äù I added, earning a bark of laughter from the Indian kid. I really need to learn his name. 
‚ÄúYeah, what brings you to our humble engineering department?‚Äù Tanner layered his own sarcasm in, finally acting like the bro I had hoped he would be. 
With the flow turned against her, Systelline‚Äôs own face began to flush. She shot me a dirty look that pierced the potent beauty charms she had laden upon herself, but did her best to smile and answer, tersely, ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ needed a change of pace.‚Äù 
Alas, an alarm on Bree‚Äôs phone alerted us all that our first lab session of the semester was about to begin. 

Of all sessions, she had to share mine. With no human shields between us, Systelline and I were finally face to face, while a post-doc student droned on about safety rules in the school‚Äôs physics lab. Perhaps, once upon a time, these talks were important, but we have computer models now. And, in rare cases, computers that actually handle them. I leaned back in my chair when I heard someone else shift their seat closer to me. A look to my left made it clear who was scooting over to me. Her hair was‚Ä¶ unmistakable. 
We sat there, in silence, as the lecturer finally finished her 30 minute spiel. As the rest of the class began to clack their stuff closed, I turned to face the invasive species that was daring to intrude upon my university experience.
I leaned upon the table, trying to convey my question through just the look in my eyes. What are you doing here? 
But I overestimated her ability to take a hint, for nearly a minute of awkward silence passed, forcing my tongue. 
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what are you doing here?‚Äù 
I honestly could not afford the truth coming out. Nor could I afford to keep sniping shots with the greatest mage of our age for an entire semester, if she even lasted that long. But for all my reservations, she seemed even less receptive to the idea of sharing her secrets. 
‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôll tell you, but again, you can‚Äôt tell anyone else,‚Äù she offered some form of an olive branch. I considered the peace offering before nodding.
‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ I can work with that,‚Äù I said, before turning around to see who was left in the room. Systelline was five steps ahead- with a quick whip of her wand, the doors snapped shut, the clicks of locks echoing through the room. From the scent of the ozone, I could already tell there was a zone spell at play. Likely a bubble of silence. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm studying Engineering,‚Äù she said, as if admitting a dirty secret. 
I took a moment, hoping there was more to it. Instead, from the defeated look on her face, it seemed even the admission was an admonishment to her. 
‚ÄúOk, no I got that part,‚Äù I said, cutting through the thick silence that fell upon us. I forgot how the buzz of magic could deafen one‚Äôs ears. ‚ÄúLet me refine the question‚Ä¶ why  are you here? Studying Engineering?‚Äù 
‚ÄúDrevel‚Äôs the best school for post-graduate engi-‚Äù 
‚ÄúOk, refining again. Why are you studying Engineering?‚Äù 
Now that I had hit upon the core of my question, the Great Mage was running out of non-sequiturs to squirrel away through. She shuffled upon her stool, her eyes dancing about wildly as the question sat upon her shoulders, drawing out more and more energy‚Ä¶ till she finally parted her lips. 
‚ÄúDo you know Evangeline Stephenson?‚Äù 
Of course I knew Evangeline. She was the second smartest kid in my grade, ambitious, daring, and the first mage in her family. Unlike the rest of our year, Evangeline had been an object of fascination. She was smart, but there was natural charm to her- she did not spend her years cultivating charms and dressing up in robes, so she had arrived on campus‚Ä¶ lacking most of the usual things one would associated with a mage. Her hair was black, her face freckled, her skin tone tanned. It was hard not to know of her. 
But what relevance did she have to the question? 
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I do but-‚Äù
‚ÄúHave you read her paper on the application of magic to electrical generation?‚Äù 
I sat there a moment. I forgot to breathe in that moment. My whole body froze, as if a paralysis spell had been laid upon it. But I remembered that paper in striking detail. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I answered, my delayed response somehow lacking anything resembling depth or thought. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ might have skimmed it.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt got rejected.‚Äù 
I blinked. My mind struggled to connect the anecdote the valedictorian was presenting to me in lieu of answering my very very simple question to any resembling a proper response. 
‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ she was talking about‚Ä¶ electrical engineering‚Ä¶ in a magic paper,‚Äù I attempted to parse through my initial reaction to her exclamation. 
‚ÄúShe was writing about new magic. Something different, something‚Ä¶ dynamic. And they decided to shut it down. Cut her funding. Archmage Vermouth even declared her work a piece of fiction-‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, was that your first time dealing with the Sages being a bunch of regressive old bags?‚Äù
‚Äú...‚Äù the look on her face said it all. I can‚Äôt say that I am surprised the so-called smartest witch in my former class was blindsided by the conservative outlook of the magical council. But then again, perhaps she never considered the future of the art she had devoted so much of her being to. 
‚ÄúOk, so, um... Yeah‚Ä¶ welcome to the real world,‚Äù I attempted to fill the empty air. ‚ÄúOld fogeys be old.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhy did you drop out?‚Äù she nearly spat at me, as if attempted to deflect her own shame back at me. 
‚ÄúI was a shit mage,‚Äù I shrugged, deflecting her deflection as if a spell bounced off a shield. ‚ÄúCome on, who wants to do magic when they‚Äôll spend the rest of their lives compared to‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ you.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDo you even know how hard it was to get into the Academy?‚Äù she spouted, livid at my attempt to deflect her away from what she seemed certain was a source of shame for me. 
‚ÄúYeah. Yeah I do. I spent FIVE YEARS studying to get in. From the moment I picked up that twig, I was stuck in prep school, taking class after class, studying for an exam that would reflect the rest of my entire life,‚Äù I felt an indignation rise up within me too. ‚ÄúMy parents would let me EAT till I got an 80% on a test exam. I was ten. And you know what happened when I got in? You did.‚Äù I paused a moment, holding up a finger to compose myself just a bit. ‚ÄúOk, it‚Äôs less that you happened, and more that my parents learned about you. It‚Äôs not just that it was you, it‚Äôs more that‚Ä¶ everyone was being compared to you.‚Äù 
‚ÄúMy parents kept comparing me to my Uncle,‚Äù Systelline offered. ‚ÄúKept telling me he cast his first spell when he was five, kept telling me I had to catch up.‚Äù It was‚Ä¶ sweet of her to offer that nugget of information. A sympathetic notion that she also shared in the suffering of her classmates. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I felt the words slip out before I could think them through.
‚ÄúMagic just‚Ä¶ takes over, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù 
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, crossing my arms.
‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ Evangeline‚Ä¶ she loves magic. I never talked to her before‚Ä¶ the rejection so I never really‚Ä¶ knew how much she loved it.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYou were in the same class for like‚Ä¶ eight years.‚Äù 
‚ÄúTwelve. We both graduated‚Ä¶ and we both got jobs at the Tower. But we just‚Ä¶ never really met.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù I finally pressed upon the lingering question. ‚ÄúWhy did you quit?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ love magic.‚Äù 
There was a chilling notion to that phrase. She understood that- the way her face set, the way her eyes darkened, even the volume of her hair seemed to crinkle and die at the very chilling thought. 
‚ÄúAll my life‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been training to use it. I was buried in those tomes. I think I bleed more ink than iron now. But when I cast my gaze to the future‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ bring myself to keep casting the same spells. Evangeline‚Äôs magic‚Ä¶ it was different. It was new.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd she could only achieve that because she never settled for what the Academy shovels down our ears.‚Äù 
She did not need to voice her agreement. It was clear from the words that came between us. For all her talents, the greatest mage of our age had never considered‚Ä¶ the more creative side of her art. I knew that pain well. 
‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a pretty shit mage too,‚Äù she seemed to lament. If she were wearing her hat, I imagine even its point would droop.
‚Äú... I mean‚Ä¶‚Äù I took a moment to actually think my response through this time. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be all that bad. You‚Äôre learning something different. Something new. Broadening your horizons. If anything‚Ä¶ that‚Äôll just make your magic better won‚Äôt it?‚Äù 
She looked at me. Confused. Lost, but not completely without her own sense of pride. As if she were asking why I was not laughing at her for the failure that she was. Perhaps that‚Äôs why she was so afraid of others learning where she was. Perhaps she hid this even from her parents. I dared not ask- there are things better left unsaid. Instead, I turned around, and angled towards the door. ‚ÄúHey, uh, Tanner‚Äôs probably organizing a study group right now,‚Äù I turned back to her. ‚ÄúIf you want in, let me know. It‚Äôd be better than hitting the books alone, you know?‚Äù 
The girl seemed to gaze up at me. Her eyes were already watering. I really, really hoped to escape the room before that happened, given the pride she had left. And it was only then she asked the question that probably needed answering most. 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù 

Kaine Lygasid finally made it home. His worn black bag was tossed upon a mismatched bed, cobbled together with the laggard care of a child whose mother was not there to hold him accountable. As sat upon his chair, his eyes swiveled from book to book upon his makeshift bookcase, the slabs of wood that composed it still lacking that finish layer of lacquer he neglected that summer. Electrical Engineering one title said. Thermodynamic Regulation claimed another. Voltage and Material: The Dragon‚Äôs Dance artfully decreed another. His hands reached for a drawer beneath his desk, a stack of papers buried within it. At the top sat a certain paper- The Future of Electricity and Mana Regulation. A Paper by Evangeline Stephenson. He already knew what lay within‚Ä¶ even the cover was marked with red ink and minor corrections, notes on the pages he had yet to review. He pulled the paper out, and then his phone, fingers moving through the list of contacts as he idly wondered if any of the mages that read the paper understood what a co-author was. 

Systelline Astravos regretfully slunk back into her home. She doubted she was detected, given the years she had poured into studying her teleportation spell. As she set her bag down, and set herself down upon her bed, she found herself staring at the desk she had used since she was a child. There was only one quill left seated upon her desk- a grey feather, molted from an aging owl she used to deliver letters to a penpal of hers. Beside it, the first medal she earned without her mother‚Äôs involvement- second place in a golem competition she and her friends all jumped into, composing runes together. She had spent so many years in this room studying her magic, shaping her future‚Ä¶ but as she looked at herself in the mirror, she recalled a suggestion from her new‚Ä¶ old‚Ä¶ classmate. She gripped her wand, memories beginning to war against each other. And with a simple flick, the face in the mirror was finally her own. ",1,1737580338.0,TalDSRuler,0,1.0,False

Hey, I added a mouse parallax thing for my game and I noticed when I switch between game screens (as shown above) it jumps around.

Hi, I am 28F and I am not sure what to do with my life. I will try to be as brief as possible.
My father killed himself and my mother kicked me from the house year ago. 
I do have a home on my own which I am still paying, but I feel all I do is work because I never go out with people.
I have a couple friends although we don't go out often and I don't get along with the rest of my family.
I am going to therapy and have been doing it for years now, even before my father died, but I got diagnosed with autism (i do not relate) and alexithymia (I do relate). 
I try to be social with people and go to a coffee shop and talk to people but everything feels fake and it is not like we stay in touch afterwards.
I do drink a lot of alcohol and smoke weed and I know I should stop, but the alternative of been numb and been in autopilot all the time is worse from my perspective. Besides, I started drinkind and doing drugs after feeling this way, so I don't think cutting this habits will solve anything (but I know they are unhealthy for sure). Most recently I have noticed weed doesn't have the same effect on my anymore (maybe if I quit for a week I would feel the same as the first time?). 

I just feel like dying and be done with life already. I think I am just bored? I wish I had enough money to do the things I want, but one part of me thinks that, even if I end up doing those expensive things I won't be happy.

1i7ls1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i7ls1f/oasis_palm_cancun_to_whoever_needs_an_honest/,Oasis palm Cancun to whoever needs an honest review.,"Checked out of Oasis Palm today.
3 kids and spouse and myself.
I don‚Äôt usually leave bad feedback because I know travelling with kids is sometimes a nightmare. I have about 10 all inclusive under my belt across Caribbean and I have to say unfortunately this hotel was the worst one. I knew it was a budget friendly hotel so I was expecting certain downside but oh man..

Food was bad. If you are in the oasis palm you get 4 out of 7 restaurants compared to the Grand Oasis which is fine .. but u need reservations for 2 out of those 4. Which trust me the app is crap and it‚Äôs impossible to book. You also have to book 24 hrs in advance by 7:30 am the day before and even then you will most def not be able to..

Buffet restaurant for dinner is alright. Good pasta. Good variety. Breakfast is hit and miss. Today was good. Yesterday not great. Lunch we skipped as we had the hot dogs from the beach bar.

Rooms.. TINY. They have moldy smell. The bathroom smell bad, backed up sewage kind of smell. Toilets will clog each time you do #2 no joke. Then hotel will take 3-4 hours to send someone with a plunger meanwhile room stinks.. bathroom and rooms are in need of serious TLC. 

Zero entertainment for kids even tho is labeled as family hotel. 
Playgrounds is old, slides are cracked and broken to the point kids cannot use it or could cut themselves.  Also no access to it besides walking in the beach, no lights either so not accesible once sun is down. There is a playroom out of the sports bar full of arcade machines. Kids loved it but after the first day they had beat every single one.

Kids pool is also in serious TLC. Moldy pools in need of a good scrub or power wash and repaint. Broken pirate statues give the overall rundown look..

The coffee shop by the lobby is the best thing out of this hotel by far. Great drinks for all. Nice warm baking available all day long. 

Cocktails and mocktails were a 5. No proper slush machines, drinks were done with a blender and they would be liquid within 5 min. 

Something that would of been super handy with a toddler was a microwave in the room. There was a mini fridge in the room but yeah didn‚Äôt work. 

There was so much people in such small space. Once it rains you CANNOT WALK inside. People run inside of course and either you bump each other or go to ur room. Lines are LONG for the one indoor bar by the lobby/sports bar. So be ready to wait a while if it‚Äôs raining and nobody is outside.

Also for those who don‚Äôt know the difference between oasis palm and grand oasis ( I didn‚Äôt) the gran oasis includes 7 restaurants and the free entrance to the pirate ship next to the hotel (is a pirate show thing). Reception said there is no difference in rooms. 

Oh also overall service was ok. Most servers in the bars were not friendly. Buffet servers were mostly friendly and happy to interact. 

Beach was ok. Small but clean. 
People LITERALLY fighting over the chairs.. we witnessed one fight and was part of another when we left our stuff in the lawn chairs and went into the ocean for about 15 min. When we came out some entitled assholes had removed our belongings and put them in a chair 30metres away‚Ä¶. I won‚Äôt even get onto that. üò°

I think this covers it. Any question feel free to ask. 

Edited to add: shuttle to hotel. They knew at check in I was returning my vehicle and coming back to hotel since my flight isn‚Äôt until 10 pm. They said oh sure we will give u a special bracelet to use the services and eat. I asked if I could take the shuttle back to the hotel (rental is at airport) and then take the shuttle back to airport at night. They said ABSOLUTely. They failed to mention shuttle needs to be booked 24hrs in advance‚Ä¶.. so that didn‚Äôt work either.. sitting at airport it is all day. 

Something not that important but is worth mentioning is that the Wifi only allows 4 devices per room as per the generated codes.. I have 5 devices / 3 kids. One of them wasn‚Äôt able to connect. Which sucked in rainy days when we spent a lot of time in the room due to the crazy amount of people in the lobby.. ",1,1737579469.0,travel,2,1.0,False
1i7lrj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i7lrj7/im_both_in_love_and_not_in_love_with_someone_from/,I‚Äôm both in love and not in love with someone from years ago,"I‚Äôm both in love and not in love with someone from years ago.

It‚Äôs a bit complicated, but here it goes: I fell really hard for someone between the ages of 16 and 17, almost 18. (I‚Äôm 20 now, turning 21 this year. Yes, this will be relevant later.)

Just to clarify, this isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúWhat do I do? Help me‚Äù kind of thing. It‚Äôs more of a ‚ÄúI just need to talk about it and get it off my chest.‚Äù

I met a woman through a dating app. This girl and I had an almost instant connection. Within a short time of talking, we already had inside jokes and stuff like that. We had very similar tastes in pop culture, hobbies, music, you name it. And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I got played. (She was real, by the way‚Äînot a catfish or anything. It was definitely her in the photos and all.) By ‚Äúplayed,‚Äù I mean: When I learned how to talk to women (without being weird, somewhere around age 15), I always preferred in-person interactions, like face-to-face dates and all. After about a month of talking to her, I asked her out. She ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù (and why the quotes?) but we couldn‚Äôt manage to meet up for the next 5‚Äì6 months. According to her, it was because of work and being busy with college. (Mind you, I was doing all that too back then.)

I know‚ÄîI should have dropped her by that point. Did I? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I believed her. I was always there, doing what I could for her, whether it was emotional support for her life problems (nothing romantic, of course‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt that stupid‚Ä¶ okay, maybe a little). She‚Äôd respond to me like twice a week at most (I‚Äôm already regretting writing this; it‚Äôs so embarrassing, I know). Anyway, her parents got divorced, the end of the year was approaching, and I was like: ARE WE EVER GOING TO MEET? Of course, I was super understanding and attentive with her (read: a total pushover).

A few more months went by, and we still hadn‚Äôt met until finally, we arranged to grab coffee and talk. She knew she was messing with my head because she kept stringing me along, implying we‚Äôd be together‚Äîjust not yet. When I finally got fed up (yes, only then‚ÄîI know), we had that ‚Äúdate.‚Äù The only thing she managed to do was apologize without even looking me in the eye. That same day, I told her something like: ‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt mind being there for you with your issues; I know you‚Äôve got personal and mental health stuff going on. But I can‚Äôt keep doing this as just a friend, you know? I love you, and I‚Äôll be there for you no matter what, but I just can‚Äôt keep going like this.‚Äù

She gave me a million reasons why she didn‚Äôt deserve me (which, looking back, I realize were true) and how she wouldn‚Äôt be good for me. Anyway, shortly after that ‚Äúdate,‚Äù I stopped talking to her completely. I even changed my phone and number, leaving my old one in a drawer.

A few days ago, I dug out that old phone, updated it, and started using it again after more than two years. I think I‚Äôve moved on, but‚Ä¶ I got attached to the ‚Äúideal‚Äù version of her, you know? The version I thought was cool, super compatible with me, attractive, funny‚Ä¶ But back to the phone: When I updated it and got it online, I didn‚Äôt expect any messages from her. Still, I decided to send her a dry ‚Äúhi,‚Äù which she quickly responded to. I wouldn‚Äôt say it led to much of a conversation, though, because I kind of dislike her now and left her on read for a few days.

She asked how I was doing, what had happened, and said she had left messages because she thought I had blocked her‚Ä¶ Anyway, when I got around to replying, she told me she was dating someone and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable keeping in touch with me. LOL. So now I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ did this change in just two days? Okay. What stuck in my head feels ‚Äúobvious‚Äù to me, though: I still have some influence over her, and I affect her in some way. Knowing that she reached out after everything gave my ego a little boost, not gonna lie.

Here‚Äôs the thing: Until I meet someone who‚Äôs more compatible with me than she ever was, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll completely get over this. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm still in love with the ‚Äúideal‚Äù version of her, but not with her. Does that make sense? Because when she said she was dating someone, all I felt was, ‚ÄúOh, cool? Good for you?‚Äù",1,1737579429.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1i7lqbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1i7lqbi/back_to_office/,Back to Office,"I (28F) started a job in September working for a small, local sub contractor qcompany. Hired by the owner(30something M) who was also the only other employee at the time. When in the interview process, he stated that he did not have an office/shop space, was looking for one with little to no luck, and that I would be working from home for the foreseeable future. He was running his business out of his van and his home garage. He mentioned several times in the interview that he really just wanted a shop space so he could appease his wife by getting his tools/supplies out of the garage. 

Since I started, we have had no issues with me working from home. My boss and I had great communication, I got my daily task lists completed within a timely manner, I did things without being asked, seriously no issues. 

Flash forward to last Thursday when I get the news that I will be expected ‚Äúin the office‚Äù on Monday and provided an address. My boss and I had met up a few times at coffee shops to discuss things or work on projects together so I figured we‚Äôd meet at this new office for a few hours then I‚Äôd be allowed to go home and finish my day there, as usual. I showed up on Monday with that in mind only to find out I‚Äôm now expected to be in office 40 hours a week. I also come to find out that this space has been in our possession for over a week and I‚Äôm just now finding out about it. 

This new office currently has no internet, no fridge/microwave/sink (bathroom only), no real desks or furniture. The building has those lights that buzz and they give me a headache. Our space is in an industrial area and we are not intending for customers to ever come in. I was even told I can lock the front door while working there if it‚Äôll make me feel safer. All that and my boss has made comments about how he doesn‚Äôt plan to fix it up because it‚Äôs ‚Äújust you here‚Äù. 

On Monday I was also informed that I‚Äôm now allowed a 30 min unpaid lunch break and that if I choose to take that break my hours will be extended to cover my lunch. OR I can ‚Äúwork through lunch‚Äù and continue to leave at my normal time. If I choose to leave for lunch I have to coordinate with him so that phones are covered. 

I‚Äôm frustrated by all of this because working from home was great for me. Besides the obvious, I‚ÄôM AT HOME reason, I found myself more productive, more focused, more relaxed. I was able to finally get into a routine that works for me and my family. I was eating better because I had access to my own food/appliances, I was more active because I could walk on my treadmill and send emails at the same time. My mental health was more stable because I wasn‚Äôt  stressed about work in general (what to wear, traffic in and out of the office, inclement weather, etc). I was actually able to enjoy this job because I was more comfortable. I‚Äôve struggled with routine for my whole life and I was finally, FINALLY, getting on track. Now that‚Äôs all been shaken up with this office situation.

I should not be expected to spend my own money to make this office workable for me. There isn‚Äôt even a trash can! There is no ‚Äúteam morale boost‚Äù by being here. I‚Äôm isolated and sitting with buzzing lights all day long as my boss and the one other employee he‚Äôs hired are field techs and spend about 20 minutes in the office each morning. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm frustrated. Like I said, comments have been made about not doing anything to the office. I know I should just talk to my boss about working from home or a hybrid schedule but I don‚Äôt want him to think I‚Äôm lazy or not being a team player.

Let me preface that I'm overweight and have no problems eating.

Started yesterday on lunch. I wasnt really hungry and couldn't pay attention to my TV show. I put my head down on my desk for the remaining 50 minutes of my lunch. Abnormal.

Got to my volunteering and just felt EXHAUSTED. Totally run down, zero energy for the whole thing (it's animal shelter cleaning). Usually I'm starving by the end of the shift.

Get home and had zero energy to shower. Wasn't hungry for dinner at all (abnormal) so ate meat & cheese with crackers. Got into bed and slept until 5 minutes before my day started (today was my weekly WFH day). Abnormal to sleep until almost time to work.

All day I've felt kinda off. I didn't get hungry for a few hours. Coffee just felt too sweet and snacks weren't satisfying. Also ate more meat & cheese with crackers for lunch. Not satisfying and only ate because it's what you do on lunch.

These are all abnormal behaviors and feelings.

A colleague was sick with FP* (she said it felt like it) 5 days ago and I've steered clear as much as possible in the office.

Everytime I feel off it triggers this phobia, specifically during winter.

I'm trying to be gentle with myself considering all the things I have going on in my life including coping with an upcoming surgery for a broken foot. I don't even have the desire to go to my hobby tonight but my boyfriend said I should.

Legal kami both sides sa family and friends kaya I felt na something wasn't right sa picture and sus na bakit wala ako kilala sa mga kasama niya and hindi niya manlang binanggit saakin.

Ff. I asked him about it. He said hindi daw niya kilala mostly nung kasama niya and yung isa lang daw talaga friend niya dun (nakilala daw sa ML) tapos nagyaya lang DAW ng ibang tropa. He also said na last year or last last year pa daw yun. (Feel ko he was just making an excuse and we've been dating for more than 3 years pero never niya binanggit so nagalit padin ako. I felt betrayed eh) Also, yung picture na yun is sa Tagaytay so meaning they drove pa since from MNL siya. Until now hindi ko alam kung recent yung picture or kung matagal na kasi he didn't give me a proper explanation ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ilang days niya akong hindi sinuyo nor kinausap. But magka shared location kami and nakikita ko at that time na halos araw araw siya lumalabas until nagulat ako kasi he started going sa Shuttle Master Badminton Centre in Makati. He's an athlete but basketball and football talaga nilalaro niya.

Idk but at that time I know something was off. Until nakausap ko friends niya and I asked them if sila ba kasama pag nag babadminton siya or kapag nasa Coffee Rush sa Rizal yung loc niya since gawain nila tumaas at tumambay sa Coffee Rush after laro. They said no daw so mas na curious ako and mas naging eager ako malaman yung totoo.

Ayun kaka investigate ng anteh niyo nalaman ko na may bago siyang ""friend"" na girl. Hinahatid sundo daw niya kasama pa yung friends nung girl. Then kumakain daw sila sa labas after maglaro badminton.
I talked to the girl and she said lagi nga daw siya niyayaya lumabas and siya daw lahat gumagastos. Niloload-an pa daw niya yung girl pag hindi nag rereply. (Sabi niya kasi sa girl he doesn't use soc med daw LOL sinungaling. Lahat kasi accounts niya sa soc med may pictures namin). Niyaya pa daw niya yung girl mag Siargao and Nueva Ecija just the two of them. Nakilala na din daw niya yung family nung girl and tinatawag pang ""mama"" yung nanay nung nung babae. He removed my polaroid picture and lock screen photo from his phone kasi sabi ni ate girl pinahiram daw ni guy yung phone niya and wala daw yung picture ko. She also said na her friends asked him daw kung may gf siya and he said ""wala"". So unaware yung babae na meron palang ako. She apologized and blocked him after nung convo
namin.

I confronted him about these and he said he's just making FRIENDS daw. Joke joke lang naman daw yung pagtawag niya ng ""mama"" sa nanay nung girl.
Ano daw bang masama? T4ng!n4. Habang ako halos mamatay na kaka overthink at kakahintay ng explanation niya about sa picture sa tagaytay may ginagawa nanaman palang bagong kalokohan? | gave him 1 month to explain.

How can I meet both of our needs? What could I do to be direct about my need, or is my boundary too rigid?","I (M24) have been dating my partner (F24) for a year and a half now, and I really love her. We are completely different people with different needs, for example, I need a lot of alone time and I don't like to text/call all day, and she needs those things to feel connected and seen by me. She needs a lot of words of encouragement and I need quality time and acts of service. It has been an exceptionally challenging relationship because we have had to navigate all of these differences (along with outside factors that I cannot share) and find compromise. We have always found a way to compromise, but a lot of times I think some things are left unhandled.

We don't live together, but we text/call every day and see each other 1-2 times a week. She has struggled with depression and chronic anxiety since we have been together, and lately it has begun to affect me a bit. Recently, I didn't respond to a text within 20 minutes and after I responded she asked me why I didn't text her back. I then tried to remind her of my boundary that I don't want to be expected to text back right away all of the time, and that made her upset. Later, she apologized very sincerely and we moved on.

This week, she has been really struggling mentally, and some of the same things have been happening. We called twice in one day and texted all day about what she's going through and processing it with her and praying with her and providing support. I tried really hard to provide as much support as I can and it didn't feel like enough, and she got upset with me again because at the end of our phone call, I told her that I would like to not be on my phone as much for the rest of the night, because I was feeling a bit overwhelmed, also because there is a friend in my life that was also upset with me for a different reason.  I told her that I would respond to her, just not right away because I needed some time off my phone, and she just told me that she would just text me in the morning. I feel as if she isn't okay with the boundary I set, but I also feel guilty whenever I need to take the time to myself. This is a boundary that I really need to have in order to stay present and secure in a relationship.

I can see why I might be TA, because I know that she really needs me to prioritize her and support her by letting her talk things out, buy her a coffee, watch a movie together, or spend time together, and some days, after work or on a particularly difficult day, I would really like to be alone and spend time unwinding on my own, and that can make it seem like I am not prioritizing her. 

Is there something I can do to ensure that I am meeting her needs while also meeting mine? Do I need to be more rigid about my boundary or do I simply need to let up a little bit?",1,1737578511.0,relationship_advice,4,0.99,False

We were very close and we had clear feelings for each other, but nothing really happened between us back then. I blame it on myself, i had zero ""game"" and was terrified of intimacy. I still do to a lesser degree. I've had a few short relationships between then and now, but nothing lasting, or fulfilling.

Last week i got a message from her. She just got divorced and has a kid. I took it as a clear sign that she's giving me a second chance, even if she hasn't stated it and seems to be purposefully avoiding any displays of affection in these messages. So of course i asked her out immediately.

We met at a coffee shop and had a pleasant time catching up, talking about the old times, work and family mostly, and she had to leave a couple of hours later. I messaged her the next day just to say i enjoyed being with her and if she'd like to have dinner soon. She told me she's too busy this week and that she'd get back to me.

Now i'm sure this can be true, but i can't help feeling like maybe i just didn't push things forward enough and she might never give me another chance again. After all, this felt more like a friendly catch-up than a date. And i have a terrible record with her.

The problem is i don't know how to go about it. I'm asexual and i fear this will be a deal-breaker for her. I'm not anti-sexual, i just don't have any libido and the sex will probably suck for her if we try it. I want to believe there's a chance it will get better if we keep trying. But it's a huge ask. I don't see how i can approach that issue with her at the moment. I don't want to waste her time, but i don't want to break it to her too soon and scare her away either. So i'm taking things slow. But taking things slow itself can be the deal-breaker. Although her divorce is pretty fresh and it was likely messy (I didn't ask for details), so it's probably best for her to take small steps too.

She knows how i feel about her. I told her everything years ago. I don't see the point in opening up about it again. If anything i want to defuse that tension. All i care about is being with her as often as possible and let things flow naturally and give her feelings for me a chance to grow. If i try to force it right away i suspect she'll just tell me she's not ready.

But i'm scared shitless of losing her again, by again not making enough moves. So i'm torn. I know that we both don't want a second date where we just talk about work and family again, that's for sure. But i'm not certain how to ""break the ice"" gently.

This is the first time i ask for relationship advice online. And I've hardly ever done it in RL either. But this is too important to me, not to try absolutely everything. Have any of you been in similar situations? As a woman, what would you be expecting from a man in this situation? As a guy, what things did you do that made it into a success story?

Carrie is puzzled why he hasn‚Äôt called, so when she runs into him in the street, she confronts him on why he hasn‚Äôt called. He reveals he‚Äôs an alcoholic, still in recovery, and should wait a little longer before dating. He asks her if it bothers her that he‚Äôs an alcoholic and girlfriend says, ‚Äúsome of my favorite people are alcoholics. Hell, I hope to be one myself someday.‚Äù Ouch.

HE JUST TOLD YOU A REAL GOOD REASON WHY NOT???

Carrie then gets frustrated and offended when Patrick doesn‚Äôt kiss her good night after three dates. Saying to herself, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it!?‚Äù while stomping up her stairs.

Once they finally kiss and sleep together she starts complaining that they‚Äôre having too much sex and he is ‚Äúaddicted to her‚Äù. She ends up telling him they need to take space apart which sends him into a bit of a tail spin and he relapses. She took zero responsibility for this and even seems annoyed by too much interest in her. Is this the same girl who threw a tantrum over not kissing her quickly enough?

I got their discovery set and wore each scent at least a day on myself as I can‚Äôt formulate my opinion only from paper testers. For context, I am 27m and I spray one spray behind each ear and on each wrist, sometimes one on my lower chest for my girlfriend. I don‚Äôt really like ranking by numbers, so I ranked the scents from my least favourite (Luna) to my most favourite (Ph√©nix). Fragrances are all unisex, edp concentration and contain many more notes, I list just the ones that I find the most prominent to me.

Alright, let‚Äôs get to it!



**LUNA**

I will start with Luna, because I am not sure what to think about this fragrance. This one is sweet, my teeth going bad sweet. I do like me some gourmands, but the opening cotton candy overpowers everything else, it stays in dry down and it is complimented by more sweetness from tonka and violet, with woody amber base. On the other hand the sweetness has this fruity freshness to it, so it balances things a little bit. Honestly if you told me, that Willy Wonka made this fragrance, I would believe you. Sadly it is just not my cup of tea.



**TAOM**

Ever had a day, when you didn‚Äôt have to do anything? Sunny afternoon with your legs kicked up, enjoying a cold beer is the vibe I get from Taom. It is a blue citrus scent with marine notes and woody base, that makes you feel at ease and relaxed. Very well blended, grapefruit and bergamot in the opening are more sweet then sour and the salt combined with pepper makes it not nauseous for me in the dry down. It‚Äôs just not unique enough for me to consider buying full bottle.



**DEUS**

Deus is supposed to make you feel like a ancient god, like you can accomplish anything in life. The overall vibe is incense-y, but what I envision is more a lumberjack in woods more then a god sitting atop of Mount Olympus. Peppery nutmeg and patchouli is, other then a sweat, which is thankfully not present, what i imagine could the lumberjacks flannel shirt smell like after working the whole day in the forest. All this fades into resinous woody notes helmeted by amber and oud, which take the place of the forest in my imagination. If you are into oudy frags, you will probably enjoy this a lot. Since I didn‚Äôt really like it on my first tryout, I wore this one the least, but still appreciate it for the manly fragrance it is. Also I can still smell it after 16 hours on my skin, very impressive.



**CARNAL**

It is summer time, you are dating that 10 out of 10 girl you met at uni. You are meeting her for a picnic, she is wearing a flowery summer dress and when you see her in the park waiting for you, you can‚Äôt help but think that she is so out of your league and yeah, she will probably dump you some day in the future, but you will not forget her scent and that scent is Carnal. Carnal opens with fresh berries, nerolli and black currant and transforms into a flower bomb. You get a very sweet smell of roses and violet, but they keep it spicy with some black pepper. According to notes, there is a woody base but I feel that it missed me during the time I wore Carnal. For me this scent leans feminine and gives me that whole summer uni girlfriend vibe, but it is very uplifting and I wouldn‚Äôt mind wearing it myself.



**SANTAL**

I didn‚Äôt like Santal at first. The opening is very confusing for me as it‚Äôs this raspberry, cardamom and thyme combination, but I decided to give it a few tries and one day I sprayed it when my girlfriend and I went to Ikea. We just chilled there, ate some swedish meatballs and since that day I really fell for Santal. Because after a little while the thyme and cardamom fade out, raspberry stays and you find soothing iris and saffron join in, then slowly dry down to milky sandalwood with just a hint of leather and for me it just feels so relaxing. Well after reading the description of this fragrance, I don‚Äôt really thing that is what they were going for, but I love it for it.



**HANZO**

With first spray you step into a pine forest. As you walk through the trees the forest is calming down and becoming silent, osmanthus and incense bring almost a meditation feeling to the scent. I am going to quote the parfumer here, because I think he nailed the feeling. Hanzo brings shinrin-yoku, a japanese term for forest bathing, when the woods are calm and quiet and you can hear your own souls speaking to you, to life. Hanzo then evolves into vetiver, oak and cedar and what I really like about him is when Hanzo almost fades away and becomes a skin scent, it evokes the smell of gingerbread cookies my grandma used to make when I was a wee kid. This has quickly become one of my top three fragrances to wear in the cold.



**KAIGAN**

If you like basil and fig, you are in for a ride. If I would imagine Kaigan as a person, he would be a italian man in his late twenties, early thirties. Tall, muscular, but calm and passionate. Sunglasses, beard, linen shirt buttoned just enough so you can see his chest hair, sipping wine in a sunny seaside italian town. He either owns a pizza place or mafia business. You probably shouldn‚Äôt talk to him, but you most definitely will. Kaigan opens with strong basil tone with a hint of citruses, it has marine tones and creamy fig, that evoke feeling of the sea and dries down to combination of woody, animalic musk. For me this is the definition of summer Italy in a bottle. I have been wearing it sometimes through the winter, but I can‚Äôt wait to bring it out in the warm.



**PH√âNIX**

Oh Ph√©nix my beloved. The spicy opening pineapple and citrus as the phoenix burst into flames, the burnout of smokey coffee, tobacco and saffron, as the phoenix rises from the ashes, the sweet leather and patchouli as the phoenixes scent lingers after it flies away. This to me is a smokey masterpiece, it is the reason I went to check out Kintsugi as a whole. The fruity burst opening fades into smoke rather quickly, but on my skin, combination of the lingering fruit, coffee beans and sweet tobacco leaves become overwhelming. This is my most used tester of the discovery set and when I spray it, I can‚Äôt stop sniffing my arm, it is that beautiful to me. When the smoke fades in the evening, the leather and other base notes keep this sweet undertone, that leave you with happy and satisfied feeling. I don‚Äôt really like to speak about performance or silage, but man this thing holds on for a full day. Sometimes you can feel it even the next day, just sitting on the skin. But it is not a inside fragrance. It tends to clog rooms and not everyone can respond well to tobacco notes in close proximity to you. It shines outside, I can‚Äôt help but wear my leather jacket and boots every time I spray this scent.



Closing thoughts: from the time I bought the discovery scent and me now writing the review I bought a full bottle of Hanzo and Kaigan and I am waiting for opportunity to buy Ph√©nix, so it is safe to say I fell in love with these scents. Kintsugi also came with a new extrait de parfum formulation called Ambr√©, but I only got to experience it on paper tester and I didn‚Äôt particularly like it. It is a warm ambery scent, with cocoa, rum and paprika. Maybe it will feel better on skin, but right now it ranks the lowest on my list. I do not recommend blind buying these, defo go to the store to smell them or buy decants. Fragrances are available worldwide, so please go show them some love on fragrantica or perfumo and if you are also a Kintsugi lover, I would love to hear your thoughts and your favourite fragrance from this house!",11,1737577767.0,fragrance,5,1.0,False

Things like:
-Leaving multiple pairs of shoes out.
-Rarely doing Laundry to the point her basket is full constantly.
-Never suggesting to wash the bed sheets etc, I always do it.
-Never vacuums or dusts surfaces.
-Leaves chocolate and other snack wrappers on sofa, bed or coffee table for days.
-Leaving used coffee mugs on her bedside table for weeks until they develop mold.
-Never wiping down kitchen surfaces after cooking so crumbs and oil splatters everywhere.
-Rarely empties the bins. I recently was so disgustingly ill for 3 weeks and that whole three weeks the bin wasn‚Äôt changed once. The smell nearly made me ill again.
-Throwing clean laundry I‚Äôve washed and folded for her on the bedroom floor and leaving for days to weeks.

This is not all of it. I should‚Äôve known, when I first went round hers when we first started dating, her room was very untidy and infact her mother found a old rotten chocolate bar under her bed that expired 3 years before they found it‚Ä¶ 

I love her to bits but this part of her really grates me. I‚Äôve made her aware so often that she needs to start being more tidy and help out with chores and the reactions are either ‚Äòok, yeah I‚Äôll try‚Äô to ‚Äògod sake not this again‚Äô.

I dunno what to do at this point.

1i7kwsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1i7kwsf/crushing_on_a_muslim_guy/,Crushing on a Muslim guy,"Hi everyone. Throw away account. 

26yo here out and proud and I feel as if I should be beyond this phase of falling for straight guys as we all learn our lesson at some point, but I am completely bamboozled at this point in my life. 

I have recently become friends with a Muslim ""straight"" guy through work and it's instantly rocketed off with really great chemistry in terms of a friendship, however the more time I spend with him the more I get confused. 

This story starts a while back. About a year ago. We have been in proximity of each other for sometime, but I have always avoided him for two reasons. He's exceptionally attractive, but more so there were always these awkward interactions that I've only had with potentials in the past, and I did not want to open a can of worms and complications. 

Fast forward a year and we are forced to work together. In the last few weeks we have become exceptionally close, spending nearly every moment together at work and outside with a group of friends. Our initial interactions at work were just conversations, but now we consistently tickle each other or touch each other in passing. Always sitting next to each other. Buying each other coffees, going out of our way to help each other with work, taking lunch breaks together. A surreal moment for me was when we spoke one-on-one in private for an hour and our eye contact would never break, but rather his conversation would taper off into silence as if he got lost and then we would both smile. Beyond this we have random days of chatting to each other over texts for hours. There's obviously a lot more moments, but it's hard to summarise. 

For me a lot of our interactions have been typical of my previous relationships, but the only exception is his faith. He still attends mosque, he brings up attractive women. I am so puzzled by my circumstance. Granted he does have tattoos, drinks and has lived with his girlfriends in the past. 

I am not one to interfere nor instigate and question another's sexuality. I am just riding this wave and seeing where it goes, but I've obviously developed a crush on him in the interim. 

Question is, has anyone had a relationship with a Muslim man, and how did you go about navigating such a situation? ",1,1737577315.0,askgaybros,5,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs where psychics come into play. üîÆüíñ You might be wondering: Can psychics really help with career guidance? Is it just a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo, or is there something more to it? üßêüí≠ Let me tell you, many people have turned to psychics for clarity when it comes to their careers, and let me just say‚Ä¶ the insights can be absolutely transformative! üå±

In this post, we‚Äôre going to dive deep into how psychics can help with career guidance, what to expect during a psychic career reading, and how this can actually bring more clarity to your professional life. So, grab your coffee ‚òï or tea üçµ, and let‚Äôs get into it! üå∏üíñ

When it comes to career decisions, so much can feel like a guessing game, right? ü§î You‚Äôre unsure whether you should pursue a new job, switch industries, or take on a new challenge. The pressure can feel overwhelming, and it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the noise of self-doubt. That's where psychics come in. üåø‚ú®

Psychics, especially those who specialize in career guidance, can offer you a fresh perspective and help you see things from a new angle. They tap into their intuitive abilities to give you clarity and support. It's like having a personal coach, but with some extra magical vibes! ü¶Ñüí´

**So, how exactly can psychics help with your career?** ü§î

The first thing you need to know is that psychics can offer a unique insight into your career path by looking beyond what‚Äôs visible to the naked eye. üßê‚ú® Sometimes, we get so caught up in our day-to-day routines or the pressure of career expectations that we lose sight of what we truly want or need. Psychics can help peel back those layers and connect you with deeper guidance.

They might use different methods such as tarot cards, astrology, clairvoyance, or even intuitive impressions to gain a sense of your life‚Äôs path. üÉèüîÆ For example, a tarot card reading might show the career opportunities you‚Äôre not seeing, or an astrologer might identify the strengths in your birth chart that align with certain careers. üåü

**Psychic Readings for Career ‚Äì What to Expect üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíº**

If you‚Äôre considering a psychic reading for career advice, you might be wondering what to expect during the session. It‚Äôs super important to know that psychic readings are not here to tell you exactly what job to take or what you *should* do with your life (sorry, no magic career fairy is going to land on your shoulder with a perfect answer!). üå†‚ú® Instead, a psychic can help you get more clarity, insights, and guidance that will help you make better decisions for yourself. üß†üíñ

A typical psychic reading might touch on areas like:

* **What your strengths and weaknesses are** when it comes to work and career üéØ
* **Where you‚Äôre currently blocked or stuck**, so you can break free and move forward üå±
* **Opportunities in your career** that might be coming your way (or ones you might have missed!) üîë‚ú®
* **Challenges you‚Äôll face** and how to overcome them with confidence üí™
* **Your soul's purpose** and how your work aligns with your true calling üîÆüíñ

One of the biggest benefits of receiving psychic career guidance is getting out of your head and tapping into your intuition. üòåüîÆ Sometimes we get so caught up in logic and practicality that we forget about the power of our gut feelings. Psychics can help you tune back into that inner wisdom you already have. When you start to listen to your instincts more, the path ahead becomes a lot clearer! üåø

**Psychics Can Help You Understand Your Life‚Äôs Purpose üå†‚ú®**

Ever feel like you're not doing what you're ""meant"" to do in life? Or that your current career doesn't really light you up? üí≠‚ú® It‚Äôs one of the most common struggles people face when it comes to their work ‚Äì not feeling aligned with their true purpose. üî•üíî This is where psychic readings can be super powerful! üå∏

Psychics often help people tap into their deeper life purpose, something that resonates with their soul on a much deeper level than just a paycheck. üí∞‚ú® When you feel aligned with your life purpose, work doesn‚Äôt feel like work. It‚Äôs a flow. It‚Äôs joyful. It‚Äôs fulfilling. And the best part? A psychic can give you the tools to help you discover what that path looks like for you. üå±üíñ

**How Can a Psychic Help You With Career Transitions? üèôÔ∏èüåü**

Career transitions can be intimidating. Whether you‚Äôre thinking of switching industries, starting your own business, or just exploring new opportunities, change can feel daunting. üò¨üíº But guess what? Psychics can offer tons of guidance on how to navigate these transitions with confidence! ‚ú®üåø

A psychic reading can help you understand:

* The best timing for a career change üå≥
* How to move through challenges during the transition process üå±
* How to deal with any fears or limiting beliefs that might be holding you back üòåüíñ

Psychics can also help you understand what is currently blocking you from making a successful career transition. Is it fear? Doubt? A lack of self-belief? Identifying these blocks can give you the clarity you need to move forward with confidence. üí´

**Why Trust a Psychic for Career Guidance? üîÆüí´**

Some people are hesitant about seeking psychic career guidance because it feels ""out there"" or unconventional. And hey, I get it! üëÄ‚ú® But let me tell you, psychics have a unique ability to tap into energy that isn‚Äôt immediately obvious to the logical mind. üß†üí´

Psychics often work from a place of deep intuition and connection to the universal energy around them. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúpredicting‚Äù your future; it‚Äôs about giving you insight into the energy around you so you can make informed decisions. üïäÔ∏èüíñ A great psychic will always empower you to take action and trust your own intuition along the way. After all, you‚Äôre the one in control of your life!

**A Quick Tip: Be Open to the Unexpected üåü**

When you go into a psychic reading for career guidance, it‚Äôs important to keep an open mind. üå±üí´ Sometimes the information that comes through may not be what you expected ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not valuable! The universe sometimes speaks to us in mysterious ways. ü¶Ñ‚ú®

For example, maybe you were thinking about a career in one field, but the psychic mentions another opportunity you hadn‚Äôt considered. üå∏ Don‚Äôt shut it down immediately. Trust that the guidance you‚Äôre receiving is meant to help you in ways that you might not see yet.

**Can Psychics Help with Finding Your Dream Job? üíºüí´**

If you‚Äôve been searching for your dream job for what feels like forever and still haven‚Äôt found it, a psychic could give you some much-needed direction. üîÆüåü They can help you understand what kind of work truly aligns with your energy and soul‚Äôs purpose. üå±üíñ

Psychics can also reveal opportunities that may not be immediately visible to you ‚Äì whether it's job openings, potential connections, or ways you can improve your resume and cover letter to stand out. ‚ú® And hey, if you‚Äôre feeling lost or unsure about your next career move, psychics can help you tune into the right direction! üöÄ

**Conclusion: Your Career, Your Path üåøüíñ**

At the end of the day, career guidance from a psychic is just one tool in your toolbox. It‚Äôs not about making decisions for you ‚Äì it‚Äôs about giving you clarity, insight, and the confidence to take the next step in your career with purpose. üíºüí´

You are the creator of your own destiny. üåü Psychics simply offer support in navigating that path. When you connect with a psychic for career guidance, you‚Äôre stepping into a space where your energy aligns with the guidance you need. Take it all in, trust yourself, and keep moving forward toward your dreams. üöÄüíñ

Keep shining, keep believing, and always trust that you‚Äôre exactly where you need to be. üå∏‚ú®",1,1737577299.0,FreePsychicReadings,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not overly worried as he‚Äôs back to terrorising the village (I am the village) but I just wanted to check what reasons there could be.

There wasn‚Äôt a hairball in the sick, but it was very watery with a bit of his food in it. He only threw up once and after being a bit shy and wanting to be left alone, he‚Äôs back to his normal hyperactive self. His behaviour before was decently normal, he‚Äôs was napping and then got up to wander, tried to hide away under the coffee table (but was stopped due to the amount of rescue missions we‚Äôve had to do) and then after he went to the bathroom to be sick.

His diet hasn‚Äôt changed at all in the last 6 months, he has no access to any sort of other food or anything. As I‚Äôm typing this he‚Äôs actually trying to break into the treat cupboard (which is under lock and key).

Is there anything I should be on the lookout for? I wouldn‚Äôt be worried if there was a hairball but as there wasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs made me a bit nervous.

Thanks!!

1i7kw1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1i7kw1h/my_first_threesome_and_the_feelings_that_follow/,My first threesome and the feelings that follow,"I had my first (and last) threesome recently and it left me feeling conflicted. I'm 38 and my husband is 42, we have 2 kids, we've been married since our 20s and we've lived a very vanilla life up until now, meaning that we have done nothing outrageous or taboo or wild.

My husband has hinted at things in the past, like swinging, etc, and I've always rejected it immediately, but for years he's been obsessed with having a threesome. He mentions it during sex, and I would tease him about it to get him off. I don't know why, I guess a moment of weakness, but one day, just after Christmas, I said ""fuck it, let's do it"". I was dreading it yet it was exciting at the same time, but ultimately I didn't expect it to happen.

Eventually my husband told me he'd found someone. I felt my stomachache drop. It was actually happening. We met up at a coffee shop and wow. She was young! 19 years old. But she wasn't a stranger, I knew her her whole life. I babysat her and bottle fed her years ago. Now a rebellious little teenager. 

So of course I was ready to call the whole thing off. Call it another moment of weakness but the two of them convinced me it would stay anonymous and that it would be a one time deal. Whatever. An hour later, the three of us were back at the house making out. My husband in the middle, us women on either side. The wet sounds of kissing and light moaning. Then piece by piece, clothes started coming off. Bras hit the floor. Than panties.

It was so awkward, yet a arousing at the same time. There was something arousing about seeing my husband in a state of such pleasure, even with another woman, and also arousing to see this girl, who'd known so long, naked for the first time. Every part of her petite figure exposed to us. The three of us got lost in the moment in a big sweaty mess of moaning and hip thrusting. She stayed the night. I could hear her and my husband going at it again while they thought I was asleep.

The next day, she overstayed her welcome. She didn't leave until middle of the afternoon, and during that time my husband made the most of groping her and kissing her every time they walked passed each other. This all took place a few days ago and I regret it. The sex, partly but not entirely. I did things to that girl I never imagined doing when I babysat her years ago. 

But I see my husband differently. Not in a good way. Every time I look at him, I keep seeing him and her together. I don't like that another woman pleasured him or was in our bed. We haven't had sex since, I don't know what will happen but it makes me sad.",13,1737577265.0,confessions,16,0.82,False

I'm learning from EXP001/2 that I could go about this a different way. Instead of doing this on my own, I wanted to invite y'all into doing this with me. The place that makes sense right now is cupping, or at least brewing the coffees however you'd like (if you don't have cupping bowls/don't like cupping). We could even meet in-person if folks are in Chicago or on Zoom if that's easier (and it's cold af right now).

I'm thinking I could put an EXP003 up, as early as next week, but really it would be for 5-6 different sample roasts. Based on feedback from people, I'd then move forward with sourcing a greater amount of the sample that most people like. I think I would only need to charge shipping for the samples: so effectively you'd try a few coffees for $4 or so.

Obviously I want to least painful route possible and I have a lot of anxiety around health things so please if you can offer any advice I‚Äôd appreciate it. I guess the biggest thing I‚Äôm afraid of is root canals because I heard they‚Äôre very painful. 

I‚Äôm not even sure if these are severe cavities or not, I‚Äôve never even had a cavity before that I know of. I also drink coffee everyday so I thought it could even be stains. I don‚Äôt really have much sensitivity issues unless sometimes when I have something super sweet. I also have tmj & tend to clench my teeth often unconsciously but I‚Äôm working on fixing it.

The precision and science that I think is most involved makes me think this group might know better than weight loss groups, or hashimotos groups (they‚Äôve gotten angry at me when I propose intermittent fasting, etc)

So I have mild hashimotos. I have a few pounds to lose. I‚Äôm 42F. Recently I had my resting metabolic rate tested and I‚Äôm (apparently) burning 2200 calories a day at rest. That shocked me - I can‚Äôt rule out that that‚Äôs wrong. But I do work out every day in the morning  (Pilates, power yoga). My meals are low carb, gluten and dairy free. Usually very caveman esque. Hearty sweet potato and lentil soup, salad with lots of protein and good fats, salmon, etc. Coffee, water. Alcohol twice a week is kind of my only indulgence. No sugar( aside from that)

Generally my weight just feels stuck. There‚Äôs really nothing else I can do. I probably only have a few pounds to lose. I feel like the solution is more of a hack than anything. 

Example, I‚Äôve been on AIP before and weight just drops off me, even with barely working out.So something about having an autoimmune disease might make the system more sluggish. (I am on synthroid btw). Also have GERD and IBS. 

The answer is probably weight training. I do a bit of it in fitness classes but should probably do more.

1i7kq88,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1i7kq88/how_much_protein/,How much protein?,"male, 215 lbs at 183 cm

Hi guys,  
startet keto about 10 days ago, lost 8-10 lbs. Water, sure, fine. Started to go to the gym every other day with short sessions and sauna at the end, feeling amazing, mood is best in years. I guess its the combination of sports and the ketogenic diet. 

Anyways, since I got this Keto Meter I realize I used too much proteine in one session (goal is about 120-150ish g / day, I think on average I was at the lower end. I used to do like 2 meals, one big at noon (at work) which had, as I know now, too much protein, so I got kicked out of ketoses for a while.

My values lately (I started to measure like 1.5 weeks ago) are between 0.3 an 1.0 , more at the area around 0.5 mmol / l (european measurement). I am a bit irritated that I had to fast for over 24 hours, ride the bike about 1.5 hours and go to the gym, to even get to a value of 1.0 that evening. Do you consider this a regular pattern? Am I being impatient or something? I wonder if I have some issue with insulin since I changed my ways after that weekend and only consume up to 40 grams of protein per meal, still have a ketosis value of about 0.3-0.6 on most data points (some in the morning - alright, there is cortisol and everything - some at the afternoon and others at the evening). 

So question 1: how do you space your intake of protein? I do 2 sessions of max. 40 grams right now plus some nuts or cheese so i presume i reach about 100 g / day which is not enough considering my weight and that I do the gym couple times per week. 

Next question: it can't be that normal or healthy that I need shitloads of greek yoghurt and cheese to feel half assed-saturated in the evening. I think due to coffee I don't even realize over the day that I don't eat enough at lunch, but in the evening, I have a stressful time to eat, but not overeat protein which would actually make me comfortable (used to do carnivore etc., low carb for years now). 

I have a feeling I am doing something wrong. I am weaker since I started to monitor protein more intense. 

Anyone got similar experiences and has a word of wisdom or two?

Fast food is often viewed as a barrier to weight loss, given its reputation for being high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats. But with smart choices, you can still enjoy fast food while working toward your fat loss goals. This guide will walk you through top fast food options, menu and tips to help you check out meals on the go without compromising your goals.

# How Fast Food Can Fit into Fat Loss Goals

Fat loss ultimately comes down to a balance of calories in versus calories out. Fast food can fit into this equation when chosen carefully.

# The Caloric Deficit

At the core of any fat loss plan is a caloric deficit, where you consume fewer calories than your body burns. Many fast food items are high in calories, but by selecting options lower in calories and avoiding oversized portions, you can achieve your goals without feeling deprived.

# Macronutrient Balance

Balancing proteins, carbohydrates, and fats can help make fast food meals more filling and aligned with your fat loss goals.

* **Protein**: Vital for muscle preservation and satiety, protein should be a key component of any fast-food meal.
* **Carbohydrates**: Opt for complex sources or smaller portions to avoid blood sugar spikes.
* **Fats**: Fats are essential but should come from healthier sources when possible.

# Portion Control

Portion control is essential when dining out, especially at fast food restaurants where servings are often oversized. Look for smaller portions or consider sharing meals when possible.

*For those seeking additional guidance on dietary balance,*¬†[*weight loss coaching*](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching)¬†*can provide tailored support based on individual goals.*

# Strategies for Making Healthier Fast Food Choices

Here are practical fast-food menus with your fat loss goals in mind.

# Customize Your Order

Many fast-food items come with added sauces, cheeses, or fried toppings that can be easily omitted to reduce calories.

* **Hold the Sauce**: Mayo-based sauces add calories and fat; ask for mustard or salsa instead.
* **Skip the Cheese**: Cheese adds fat and calories. If you don‚Äôt need it, skip it.
* **Choose Whole Grains**: When available, select whole-grain buns or wraps to increase fiber intake.
* **Add Extra Veggies**: Most fast-food chains allow you to add vegetables to your order, increasing fiber and nutrients.

# Watch Your Beverages

Sugary drinks can add hundreds of calories to your meal. Here are some tips for making smarter beverage choices:

* **Stick to Water**: Water is calorie-free and helps with hydration.
* **Opt for Unsweetened Tea or Black Coffee**: These are great low-calorie options.
* **Be Wary of Smoothies**: Although some smoothies appear healthy, they can be high in sugars and calories, especially if they‚Äôre large in size.

# Smart Side Choices

Sides are often calorie-dense, so choosing lighter options can help you stay within your calorie budget.

* **Skip the Fries**: Go for side salads, apple slices, or yogurt.
* **Avoid Value Deals**: These often encourage you to buy more than you need.

*For those seeking nutritional counseling,*¬†[*weight loss insurance*](https://try.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-insurance/)¬†*may cover consultations to help make informed choices.*

# Understanding Nutritional Information

Knowing how to interpret nutritional information can empower you to make healthier choices when ordering fast food.

# Reading Labels

* **Check the Calorie Count**: Knowing the calorie content of menu items can help you stay within your daily goals.
* **Macronutrient Breakdown**: Look for meals with a balanced amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
* **Sodium Levels**: Many fast-food options are high in sodium. Aim for items with lower sodium levels if possible, as excess sodium can lead to water retention and elevated blood pressure.

# Use Apps and Online Tools

Many fast-food chains provide nutritional information online or through mobile apps.

* **Nutrition Apps**: Tools like MyFitnessPal or Lose It! can help you track your intake.
* **Restaurant Websites**: These often provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on their menu items.

# Planning Ahead for Success

Planning can help prevent impulsive decisions that may not align with your goals.

# Research Ahead of Time

Many fast-food chains publish their menus online, allowing you to decide on a healthy choice before you even get there.

* **Know Your Options**: Familiarize yourself with healthier menu items at your favorite fast-food spots.
* **Establish a Go-To Order**: Having a default order in mind can reduce the temptation to choose less healthy options.

# Time Your Meals

* **Avoid Skipping Meals**: Skipping meals often leads to excessive hunger and impulsive food choices.
* **Eat Before You‚Äôre Extremely Hungry**: When you‚Äôre not overly hungry, you‚Äôre more likely to make rational choices.

*Personalized coaching can be beneficial for meal planning, especially for those who regularly eat on the go. Consider*¬†[*weight loss coaching*](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching)¬†*for tailored strategies.*

# The Importance of a Balanced Mindset

Approaching fast food with a balanced mindset can help prevent feelings of guilt or restriction.

# Moderation is Key

It‚Äôs okay to indulge occasionally as long as it fits into your overall calorie goals.

* **Avoid Deprivation**: Depriving yourself can lead to binge eating. Instead, allow yourself small treats in moderation.
* **Celebrate Small Wins**: Recognize the progress you‚Äôre making, whether that‚Äôs choosing water over soda or opting for grilled instead of fried foods.

# Practice Mindful Eating

Mindful eating can help you enjoy your food while making conscious choices.

* **Eat Slowly**: Slowing down can enhance satisfaction and prevent overeating.
* **Pay Attention to Hunger Cues**: Eat when you‚Äôre hungry and stop when you‚Äôre full, even if that means saving some of your meal for later.

*For those who struggle with emotional eating, guidance through*¬†[*weight loss coaching*](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching)¬†*can help address behavioral challenges.*

# When to Consult a Professional

If you‚Äôre consistently making healthy choices but not seeing results, it may be time to consult with a nutritionist or healthcare provider.

# Registered Dietitians

Dietitians can provide personalized meal plans based on your unique needs and goals, ensuring that you‚Äôre meeting all nutritional requirements even when including fast food.

# Medical Options

For some individuals, supervised interventions may be helpful.

* **Metabolic Testing**: This testing can provide insights into your resting metabolic rate and help set accurate calorie targets.
* **Weight Loss Medications**: Medications like¬†[semaglutide and tirzepatide](https://try.getzealthy.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide/)¬†are options for some people under medical supervision.

*Insurance may cover some consultations with dietitians or specialists, so check if*¬†[*weight loss insurance*](https://try.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-insurance/)¬†*is available to support your journey.*

1i7knud,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7knud,"Candles, cats and frag lit (and is anyone interested in r/luxurycandles book club?)","The more time I‚Äôve spent collecting luxury candles and perfumes, the more I‚Äôve become fascinated with the science and history behind scent. I‚Äôve recently picked up a few books to keep me company on cold January days that I have been enjoying and wanted to share. Today‚Äôs reading was paired with a burn of Amande (I was concerned about some not great reviews, but I love it! It smells just like almond flour to me - including the pronounced waxy notes - with hints of delicate florals. The throw is solidly medium to me, it fills the room nicely without overpowering it). 

Anyway, on to the books!

Atlas of Perfumed Botany: a beautifully illustrated mapping of fragrances. It doesn‚Äôt go deep, but it‚Äôs a great introduction to various scent families, their origins and history. A lovely book to have on your coffee table to thumb through occasionally, and would also make a thoughtful gift.

The Secret of Scent:   I did not know how much of an enigma scent has been to the scientific community. No one is quite sure just how the nose works, exactly - in this book, Luca Turin sets out to try and crack the mystery.  You can‚Äôt help but be swept up in his deep, obsessive passion for the subject as he relays his account of biology and chemistry behind olfaction, with a liberal sprinkling of perfume history. There‚Äôs a LOT of emphasis on science and chemistry - including actual chemistry equations and chemical makeup of various scent molecules to illustrate the author's thought process -  which has me wishing that I paid more attention in my high school chemistry class (alas, I was always more of an English Lit person).

Emperor of Scent: I am so looking forward to this one! This is a book about Luca Turin - which inspired me to read his own account first. I couldn‚Äôt not get my hands on this book after reading reviews like this:

""A brilliant, feisty scientist at the center of a nasty, back-stabbing, utterly absorbing, cliff-hanging scramble for the Nobel Prize.  The Emperor of Scent is a quirky, wonderful book."" 
-John Berendt, author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil

I have Nez‚Äôs issue Money & Fragrance on its way to me and I‚Äôm excited to dig into this publication. I had to stop myself from ordering multiple issues - I am a terrible hoarder of books and all things printed, and I stubbornly refuse to go digital.

Since we still have a few slow, wintery months ahead of us in the Northern Hemisphere - which pair so well with candles and cozy reading - I wonder if there are other folks out there who enjoy reading about perfumery and fragrance? If we have interest we could start a little informal book club. Let me know if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd be into!
