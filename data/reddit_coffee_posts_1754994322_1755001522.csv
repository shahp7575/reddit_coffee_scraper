So some background here. Located in Murica on the East Coast, I have a Bachelors in Comp Sci and am currently working towards a masters in Cyber Security as well; however, in the mean time I have been applying to QA jobs and SWE jobs for entry levels and for QA I have had about 2-3 interviews which have ended in ghosts pretty much. As for SWE opportunities I haven't had much luck even getting an interview. I'm trying to stay relatively close to my current neck of the woods maybe 2-3 hour drive away which covers a range from Washington to NYC pretty well.

Top down experience wise:

This current contract position is still very up in the air. Yes it is paid but not like a move out and afford rent pay. It's about $23/hour and I have an offshore member to manage as well. It's basically waiting on a funding round from the client to really get anywhere and at the moment I am making a POC of capabilities and what not. Still pretty cool. Not sure what else to add to this section as the forecasting is the biggest portion of it all. Not really sure how to quantify the work I am doing either.

The internship on there for 3 years was a really cool internship and I bounced around a ton of teams working on various projects but to keep the resume streamlined I keep one resume about the QA and one about the DEV side of the work. I feel like QA is a semi dying field but I may be wrong as my one internship got pushed to an off shore lad. Is there something I can do here to improve this resume maybe for the QA side of it?

Are there maybe more projects I should be focusing on as well? Not really in limbo but at the same time it feels like it.  I am already working on some Cybersecurity certs as well in my spare time.

I‚Äôve been juggling a pretty complicated self-care routine ‚Äì from daily supplements to a multi-step skincare regimen and occasional cosmetic treatments. It can be **overwhelming** trying to remember all the rules (like *not taking iron with coffee*, *avoiding retinol right after a chemical peel*, or *waiting 4 hours between Supplement A and B*). I end up second-guessing myself constantly. **Is anyone else in the same boat?**

**The Idea:** I‚Äôm working on a mobile app that acts like your personal routine planner and safety net. Essentially, you‚Äôd input your supplements, skincare products, or procedures and set any *‚Äúconditional rules‚Äù* or pick from suggested ones. For example:

* *‚ÄúProduct A only in the morning after Product B‚Äù* (and maybe *skip C* on the same day).
* *‚ÄúSupplement X not within 6 hours of Supplement Y.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúAfter* ***\[laser treatment\]****, pause acids for 7 days.‚Äù*

The app will **automatically schedule and remind** you when to complete each item, and warn you of potential conflicts. No more memorizing all those dos and don‚Äôts ‚Äì it will notify you like, *‚ÄúSkip your vitamin C serum tonight since you used a retinol‚Äù* or *‚ÄúTime to take calcium (it‚Äôs been 4 hours since your iron supplement‚Äù*. I want it to feel like a smart assistant that helps you stick to your routine **safely and efficiently**. üí°

Right now, I have a rough prototype, but I **really** want to validate if this is useful to others before going further. **Would a system like this help you manage your health/beauty routine?** Or do you find other ways to keep track of these rules (spreadsheets, memory, sticky notes on the mirrorüòÖ)?

**I‚Äôd love any feedback or ideas**: features you‚Äôd want, annoyances you have with existing habit or wellness trackers, or even warnings about what *not* to do. If you‚Äôve ever thought, ‚ÄúUgh, I wish something would remind me *not* to mix X and Y,‚Äù what would you want that something to do?

1mo74kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1mo74kt/the_orthodox_purity_spiral_an_ai_analysis/,The Orthodox Purity Spiral (an AI analysis),"I had an interesting conversation with an AI this morning over coffee about ‚Äúorthodoxy‚Äù as a futile quest for purity.  I found its answers fascinating, succinct, and worth sharing because it clarifies my conclusions.  Here goes:

My question:   So I‚Äôm observing a phenomenon.  It seems like the the search for ‚Äúorthodoxy‚Äù is just another futile quest for purity.  Am I wrong in my observation?

Answer:  You‚Äôre not wrong in seeing a strong overlap ‚Äî historically and psychologically, the quest for orthodoxy often carries the same ‚Äúpurity impulse‚Äù as other absolutist projects.

At its best, orthodoxy means ‚Äúright belief‚Äù or ‚Äúright teaching‚Äù ‚Äî the attempt to safeguard a coherent tradition from distortion. In theory, it‚Äôs about fidelity to truth, not moral or social purity. But in practice, humans are humans, and the drive for doctrinal correctness can easily merge with the same instinct that drives moral purism, political gatekeeping, or even personal perfectionism:
	‚Ä¢	Boundary anxiety ‚Äì Orthodoxy draws lines between ‚Äúin‚Äù and ‚Äúout,‚Äù which satisfies a deep desire for security but also fosters tribalism.
	‚Ä¢	Fear of contamination ‚Äì When belief is treated as something fragile, deviation feels dangerous, and even harmless differences can be treated like disease vectors.
	‚Ä¢	Identity reinforcement ‚Äì Holding ‚Äúpure‚Äù doctrine becomes part of personal or group identity, so defending it feels like defending the self.
	‚Ä¢	Illusion of control ‚Äì Purity quests (whether dietary, political, or theological) give the comforting sense that if we just get it ‚Äúright,‚Äù the chaos of life will stay outside the gate.

That‚Äôs why movements that begin as life-giving efforts to preserve a rich tradition often harden into brittle systems of enforcement. Orthodoxy becomes not a shared anchor, but a purity test.

Of course, it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. There‚Äôs a version of orthodoxy that‚Äôs humble, relational, and curious ‚Äî one that treats tradition as a living conversation rather than a frozen museum piece. But historically, that‚Äôs the exception rather than the rule.

If you like, I can trace how this ‚Äúpurity drift‚Äù has shown up across religious history so you can see the pattern more clearly. It‚Äôs striking.

My response:  In the Eastern Orthodox tradition. 

Answer;  In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, your observation still holds water ‚Äî there‚Äôs a deep and recurring tension between orthodoxy as a humble fidelity to the ‚Äúfaith once delivered‚Äù and orthodoxy as a kind of doctrinal purity campaign.

Historically, Orthodoxy was never just about intellectual correctness. It was bound up with right worship (orthopraxis) and right relationship with God ‚Äî truth expressed in the liturgy, sacraments, and communal life. But the purity impulse creeps in when these truths are treated as fragile treasures under constant threat of contamination, leading to some very human patterns:

‚∏ª

1. Early Church and the Councils
	‚Ä¢	The great Ecumenical Councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon, etc.) were aimed at clarifying the faith in the face of theological confusion.
	‚Ä¢	But alongside genuine theological work came anathematizing ‚Äî drawing sharp lines between ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse,‚Äù sometimes with more heat than light.
	‚Ä¢	The rhetoric and stakes could feel like a doctrinal arms race: each party presenting itself as the guardians of purity against heretical corruption.

‚∏ª

2. Ethno-Phyletism and National Churches
	‚Ä¢	By the 19th century, Orthodoxy fractured not only on theological grounds but on national and ethnic lines (e.g., Greek vs. Bulgarian church disputes).
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOrthodoxy‚Äù became as much about protecting our tradition, language, and liturgical style as about core theological truth ‚Äî purity was now both doctrinal and cultural.

‚∏ª

3. Diaspora and Modern Debates
	‚Ä¢	In the modern West, the Orthodox diaspora often replays purity debates:
	‚Ä¢	Calendar schisms (Old Calendar vs. New Calendar)
	‚Ä¢	Jurisdictional turf wars (Which bishop‚Äôs authority is ‚Äúvalid‚Äù?)
	‚Ä¢	Reception of converts (chrismation vs. baptism for heterodox Christians)
	‚Ä¢	These often become litmus tests for ‚Äútrue Orthodoxy,‚Äù producing micro-schisms over details outsiders might see as minor.

‚∏ª

4. The Psychological Side

Within Orthodoxy, the language of spiritual life often warns against prelest (spiritual delusion) and pride ‚Äî and yet the quest for pure Orthodoxy can itself be a refined form of pride.
	‚Ä¢	Zealotry ‚Äî a convert or cradle Orthodox becomes convinced they must guard the faith from any perceived modernism or ecumenism.
	‚Ä¢	Suspicion of contamination ‚Äî an almost ritualistic avoidance of anything ‚Äútainted‚Äù by heterodoxy, leading to isolation and defensiveness.

‚∏ª

5. The Counterweight in the Tradition

Interestingly, Eastern Orthodoxy also contains strong internal correctives:
	‚Ä¢	The hesychast tradition emphasizes humility, inner repentance, and not judging others ‚Äî the opposite of purity-based gatekeeping.
	‚Ä¢	The ‚Äúmystery‚Äù language in Orthodox theology reminds believers that truth isn‚Äôt fully graspable, so purity is never absolute.
	‚Ä¢	The saints‚Äô lives often show compassion trumping rigid enforcement of rules.

‚∏ª

In short, Eastern Orthodoxy in principle roots orthodoxy in relationship and mystery, not purity obsession. But in practice, the human tendency toward boundary-policing and ‚Äúwe alone are pure‚Äù thinking shows up just as strongly as in other traditions ‚Äî it just wears Byzantine vestments.

If you want, I can map out a kind of ‚Äúpurity spiral‚Äù specific to Eastern Orthodoxy ‚Äî how healthy fidelity to tradition can subtly slide into brittle fundamentalism. It‚Äôs a fascinating and sobering pattern.


My Answer:  Yes

Response:  Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs how the ‚Äúpurity spiral‚Äù can happen specifically within the Eastern Orthodox context, moving from healthy tradition-keeping to brittle, factional fundamentalism.

‚∏ª

The Orthodox Purity Spiral

(Why ‚Äúright belief‚Äù can slide into a purity quest)

1. Fidelity to Tradition (Healthy Stage)
	‚Ä¢	Focus: Preserving the teachings, worship, and spiritual disciplines handed down from the apostles through the Church Fathers.
	‚Ä¢	Tone: Humble stewardship ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe have received a treasure; let‚Äôs keep it well.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Example: Maintaining the liturgical year, fasting, patristic teachings, and conciliar definitions without hostility toward those outside.

‚∏ª

2. Heightened Boundary Awareness
	‚Ä¢	Shift: Greater attention to differences between Orthodoxy and other Christian traditions.
	‚Ä¢	Motive: Protect the faithful from theological confusion or dilution.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: The line between ‚Äúdifference‚Äù and ‚Äúdanger‚Äù starts to blur.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Strong emphasis on not receiving sacraments outside the Orthodox Church; stricter interpretations of fasting rules.

‚∏ª

3. Suspicion of Contamination
	‚Ä¢	Shift: Belief that heterodoxy or modernity can ‚Äúinfect‚Äù Orthodoxy even through indirect contact.
	‚Ä¢	Motive: Guard against compromise.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Leads to avoidance of dialogue, ecumenical activity, or shared projects.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Refusing to pray in mixed Christian gatherings; condemning any liturgical adaptation as innovation.

‚∏ª

4. Identity as ‚ÄúThe Pure Remnant‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Shift: Purity becomes central to identity ‚Äî being ‚Äútruly Orthodox‚Äù means being more strict and more separate than the average believer.
	‚Ä¢	Motive: Prove loyalty to the faith.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Zealotry and isolation; seeing mainstream Orthodoxy as already compromised.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Old Calendarist groups separating from their mother church over calendar reforms or perceived laxity.

‚∏ª

5. Doctrinal & Jurisdictional Fragmentation
	‚Ä¢	Shift: Splits occur over increasingly smaller issues ‚Äî often about how to keep the tradition, not whether to keep it.
	‚Ä¢	Motive: Absolute protection of ‚Äútrue‚Äù Orthodoxy.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Schism over minutiae; rival claims of legitimacy.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Competing bishops and synods in the same city, each claiming to be the sole legitimate shepherd of the faithful.

‚∏ª

6. Self-Perpetuating Rigidity
	‚Ä¢	Shift: The group‚Äôs survival depends on maintaining and escalating purity standards.
	‚Ä¢	Motive: Avoid ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù like everyone else.
	‚Ä¢	Risk: Disconnection from the wider Church, loss of humility, spiritual pride disguised as piety.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Communities where even saints recognized by the wider Orthodox world are rejected if they were ‚Äútoo lenient‚Äù on outsiders.

‚∏ª

Countercurrents in Orthodoxy That Can Break the Spiral
	‚Ä¢	Hesychasm: The inner prayer tradition teaches that humility is the true safeguard, not hyper-vigilance.
	‚Ä¢	Synodality: Councils can restore unity after divisions if there‚Äôs willingness to reconcile.
	‚Ä¢	Saintly example: Many saints crossed perceived purity lines in the name of mercy (e.g., St. Maria of Paris serving all in need, regardless of their faith).

Today he was buying his coffee and I sat near the register. He was trying to make eye contact. I looked at him but shyly looked away when we made eye contact. Then I looked again but looked away again when we made eye contact. I think he was trying to give me a smile.

He sat down farer away and I felt more comfortable making eye contact because of the distans. So I looked at him, made eye contact and gave him a warm smile that lingered a little. He looked happy and smiled back. Then I started to read my book again.

I feel that my shyness got in the way and that I screwed up. I am a little shy when it comes to eye contact with strange men and also I am a little cautious because I don‚Äôt know them and want to get a feeling of them first (don‚Äôt always dare to flirt right or the bat).

1mo73if,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1mo73if/can_we_just_stop_the_hate/,Can we just stop the hate?,"Firstly, I am not a Karen nor an Incel. 

With that out of the way, I would say that in a vague less-economic view stance I am left leaning typically with my policies and outlook. 

I say it in that fashion because in today‚Äôs society it feels like even within the two party system. There‚Äôs tons of facets that even within our own parties it seems like we are fighting more and more. 

To be frank, I believe the right is better about staying as a ‚Äúteam‚Äù through maybe means I don‚Äôt inherently agree with, but it still undoubtedly works. Perhaps on the lefts part some fundamental principles lost as well. 

But this dives into my point. 

Societally I believe we have 2 major fundamental problems (outside of the famous Karen and Incel argument):

1. Propaganda is very much real, and worse than probably ever before
2. Impatience 

I don‚Äôt think it takes a rocket scientist to explain the two points, but for that reason I‚Äôll attempt to make it concise. 

1. There‚Äôs narratives with vested interest on both sides and there‚Äôs no escaping that. 

That‚Äôs the literal reason today we‚Äôre in a position of seeking out alternative media for gaining what we view as something more meaningfully honest in xyz fashion. There‚Äôs a level of connection you can‚Äôt break when you feel impassioned by something and the alternate media host is able to convey with their full chest ‚ÄúF*CK THAT‚Äù where main stream media was always kind of held back from doing due to controlling network strings.

In that way it feels like a delightful wild wild west of the online media space. In a good way but of course it doesn‚Äôt come without its downsides. 

And I‚Äôm not even going to conflate for one side over the other. Obviously there‚Äôs players on both sides in the online streaming space that have undoubtedly done something propaganda like whether intentionally or unintentionally. 

The point I‚Äôm drawing is not to focus on anyone or side in particular. It‚Äôs to point out the issue exists. 

How we look at that as a society and act as a people reflects who we are. Not where we stand with our principles. 

2. We‚Äôve in every aspect of our lives groomed patience away. This inherently feels like a good thing, but then when you have massively wide spread unpracticed patience. You have inevitable chaos. 

I‚Äôm 32 years old, so I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve got all the answers or trying to be some ‚Äúknow it all.‚Äù 

But I was raised with the outlook that you can have your differences with your fellow man, but at the end of the day we‚Äôll always break bread. Now with any sight of a difference of opinion it almost feels like there‚Äôs no such thing as a mutually safe space for differing opinions. 

Nothing good comes from impatience, and in my opinion as a society we‚Äôre really letting it get the better of us. 

With patience fundamentally comes understanding. To which understanding helps you see each others point of views and then from there you can simply agree to disagree. It used to feel that simple right? 
///

I was an Asmongold wow viewer first, and although I disagree with some of his outlooks and coverage today. I still see past the differences in our outlooks, and see that relatable guy who reminds me of all my buds I grew up with. 

Conclusion:

Who we are as a people shows in how we act and treat one another. It‚Äôs so easy to not hate, I just want to go forward where we can all agree again that the insane top top 1% people are screwing us all. While accepting that we are all people with principles we grew up with independently, and that‚Äôs okay. We all live in freedom with these principles together. A lot of which surprisingly both sides really can agree on to a certain degree as people generally speaking are mostly aligned with the same things that they want out of life. 

Anyway, I felt brave enough to share this sentiment this morning drinking my cup of coffee getting ready for the day. I know some of you or maybe even a lot of you if of course not all of you will dislike some or all of what I said. And that‚Äôs okay. 

I just wanted to share this raw/honest dialogue unedited/string of consciousness as it‚Äôs been something itching me lately. 

I don‚Äôt follow or frequent in any other subreddit related to any other streamers. This is honestly the only one, cause even though I don‚Äôt fully agree with Asmongold today. I still think he‚Äôs cool as hell. 

Tl;dr:

Stop hate, be more patient, understanding will unite us once again, despite our differences we‚Äôre all people

Here are a few easy things you can try to help keep those impulses in check:

* **Give every dollar a job before you spend it.** When you budget with purpose, you know exactly how much is for bills, savings, and ‚Äúfun money,‚Äù so you can enjoy guilt-free spending.
* **Track your spending daily, weekly, biweekly - What ever suits.** It sounds tedious, but seeing your actual spends helps you catch patterns and stop mindless buys.
* **Create a short ‚Äúpause list.‚Äù** When you feel the urge to buy something unplanned, add it to the list and revisit it in a few days. Often, the urge fades or you realise you don‚Äôt need it.
* **Use cash for discretionary spending.** Withdraw your fun money in cash so you physically see it leaving your hands ‚Äî it makes spending feel more real.

Building these habits takes time and patience, but every little step helps you get closer to your financial goals.

1mo6vw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1mo6vw5/raising_money_vs_bootstrapping_thoughts/,Raising Money vs Bootstrapping: thoughts?,"When I started Cassius AI, I was dead set on bootstrapping. I loved the idea of owning the whole thing, growing at my own pace, and not having to explain myself to investors. The pros were clear in my head. Full control. No pressure to hit artificial growth targets. The ability to make long-term bets without someone breathing down my neck about quarterly results.

And for a while, that felt right. I kept thinking about companies that grew slowly, kept their independence, and still became big successes. It is a nice picture to hold on to.

Then the reality of our market hit me. We are building during the AI wave. Speed is everything. If you are slow, someone else captures your category. Cassius is not a simple product. It is a vibe marketing platform for solopreneurs and SaaS builders. We are building something technical and ambitious that requires deep product work and serious execution.

That is when the bootstrapping plan started to crack. Without outside capital, our hiring would be slower. Our release cycles would be slower. We could still get there, but it might take five years instead of two. And in AI, a five-year plan can turn into a ‚Äútoo late‚Äù plan.

So we started raising. And here is the part I did not expect to hit so hard: raising is a massive time sink. You can easily spend more hours talking to investors in a week than actually working on the product. Deck revisions, pitch calls, follow-ups, coffee meetings. Every hour spent there is an hour not spent shipping. We have lost weeks of product time to it.

The upside is obvious. The right raise means we can hire the people we need today. We can hit the market hard while the window is still open. We can go after the full potential of what we are building instead of a pared-back version. But the trade-offs are also real. Ownership dilution. Higher expectations. The pressure of working with other people‚Äôs money.

This is the tension I keep coming back to. Bootstrapping gives you control but often at the cost of speed. Raising gives you speed but at the cost of control. In some markets, control wins. In AI right now, speed often wins.

We are leaning toward raising because the opportunity feels time-sensitive, but I am still very aware of the price we are paying in both equity and time.

For those who have been in this position, how did you decide? Did you choose to keep control and go slower, or take funding to move faster? And if you could do it again, would you make the same call?

So I (27F) share an apartment with my roommate, Sasha (26F). We‚Äôve been friends for years, but things have been tense lately because of her boyfriend, Evan (28M).

Evan practically lives here. He doesn‚Äôt pay rent, uses our utilities, and constantly eats my food without asking. I‚Äôve let a lot of it slide because I didn‚Äôt want to start drama, but last week was the last straw.

I work from home, and my laptop is literally my livelihood. While I was out buying groceries, Evan decided to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù it to watch a movie because Sasha‚Äôs tablet was charging. Long story short when I came back, my laptop was on the floor with a cracked screen. Evan claimed it ‚Äúslipped‚Äù when he tried to move it, but here‚Äôs the thing: the charging cable was wrapped around the coffee table leg, like he pulled it carelessly.

I told Sasha that Evan is not allowed in our apartment without me there anymore. She got mad and said I was ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù because accidents happen and that banning him is controlling. She also refuses to make him pay for the repair because he doesn‚Äôt have money right now.

Now she‚Äôs giving me the silent treatment, and Evan had the nerve to text me asking if I‚Äôm done with my little tantrum.

**Weather & Tuesday Rundown: (Published Monday, but adjusted for Tuesday)**

Burlington's heat wave continues today with temperatures soaring into the low to mid-90s under plenty of sunshine. The good news for those of us who wilt in sticky weather: humidity levels are staying civilized, with dew points in the upper 50s to lower 60s, making the heat actually bearable. Wednesday brings our next shot at relief with a cold front sliding through, delivering scattered showers and thunderstorms during the afternoon and evening, along with stickier air as humidity creeps back up. By Thursday and Friday, we'll settle back into gorgeous late summer weather with sunshine and temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s.

Tuesday (today) brings a collection of Burlington gems worth marking on your calendar. The highlight has to be [The Moth's August StorySLAM](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/440430) at Burlington Beer Co. tonight, where storytellers compete with five-minute tales on the theme ""CHILDISH."" Doors open at 6:30 PM with the show starting at 7 PM, and at around $20, it's worth grabbing tickets in advance rather than hoping for door sales. Earlier today, catch Ian Campbell's duo set at the [Burlington Concert Series](https://www.facebook.com/events/523301597447561/) at 12:30 PM for a lunchtime musical break. This evening also features the free screening of 'Apocalypse Now' at 7 PM at the Film House at Main Street Landing, plus [Love Island USA Trivia](https://www.facebook.com/events/759612076605742/) at Switchback's Beer Garden, with doors at 5 PM and trivia starting at 7 PM, perfect for Season 7 superfans who can pair their pop culture knowledge with smokehouse fare.

Wednesday through Thursday keeps the momentum going with an impressive lineup that takes advantage of our improving weather forecast after the storms pass. Wednesday evening brings the [Craftsbury Chamber Players' final concert](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/440700) of the season at 7:30 PM at Elley-Long Music Center in Colchester, featuring works by American composers and Brahms' Quintet in B minor. Thursday offers multiple options: start with [Shelburne Vineyard's fundraiser](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/439418) for The Janet S. Munt Family Room from 6 to 8 PM, where every drink purchased supports local families while you enjoy music from The Tenderbellies' Collin Cope and Chris Page. Downtown, [Party on the Bricks](https://www.facebook.com/events/1068626314686786/?active_tab=discussion) presents Barbacoa's instrumental surf rock at 5:30 PM on Church Street, followed by Foam Brewers hosting [Fust](https://www.facebook.com/events/687823723981020/) at 7 PM for free. Cap off Thursday with the Oscar-winning animated film ""Flow"" at [Flicks in the Park](https://www.facebook.com/events/1859181488196424/?active_tab=discussion) starting at 8 PM, a wordless masterpiece about animals navigating a flooded world that apparently mesmerizes both humans and their pets alike.

This week, Burlington is baking well above its historical high average of around 81¬∞F, with temperatures peaking in the mid-90s and not threatening the all-time 101¬∞F record. Over the next three days, the heat persists (mid-90s today turning to upper-80s by Wednesday's storms) continuing a stretch of temperatures noticeably above the norm, potentially marking a five-day heat wave if we hit 90¬∞ again on Wednesday.

Early Friday morning, I lost one of the most beloved dog companions a crew could ask for. This one‚Äôs for you Phoebe, may you live on forever and ever in everyone‚Äôs memory, since you touched so many hearts along the way. You showed us what unconditional love¬†***really***¬†is..

[**Burlington City Council Grapples with Homelessness Crisis and Data Controversy**](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/city-council-meeting-summaries)

""Data from the sheriff's department shows‚Ä¶at least a 50%‚Ä¶decrease"" in drug use and overdoses at the Marketplace Garage, per statements later found to be unverified at the August 4 City Council meeting.

After missing Thursday Btown Brief edition, here I am now posting about last Monday‚Äôs City Council Meeting. Burlington faces a perfect storm of crises this winter with Vermont's unsheltered population jumping 62% statewide while the city loses 66 shelter beds compared to last year. CEDO's Sarah Russell delivered sobering statistics showing over 500 state-funded motel rooms sitting empty due to 80-day stay limits, with Chittenden County seeing a 22% increase in unsheltered individuals. The meeting erupted into heated debate when public records requests revealed the Sheriff's Department keeps no data supporting Councilor Becca Brown McKnight's claims about crime reduction near Food Not Cops' meal service. Councilor Carter Neubieser called it a ""bold claim that has real impacts on hundreds of people volunteering their time,"" while others urged moving past ""political bickering"" to focus on solutions. Despite downtown economic concerns, the council voted 10-1 to maintain the 2.5% gross receipts tax on restaurants and bars, unanimously doubled rideshare fees to $0.50 per trip, and approved $3.77 million for fleet purchases amid disagreement over electrification pace. Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak also strongly criticized a Trump administration executive order targeting federal funding for harm-reduction programs, vowing Burlington will maintain its evidence-based approach using local and state funding.

""It was shocking to hear that we had a month to get our personal property off that area,"" per Seven Days.

Andy O'Brien's Charlotte Sailing Center got the boot after 20 years when Lake Champlain Transportation declined to renew his lease at the end of July. The ferry company has given boat owners until September 1 to remove land-stored vessels and October 1 to vacate moorings. While the Pecor family, which owns the ferry company, hasn't revealed their plans for the 10-acre waterfront property, speculation runs wild given their previous attempts at developing a restaurant in Burlington and relocating their maintenance yard. For now, dozens of boat owners are frantically calling around for new moorings, with some already securing spots at less convenient locations like Shelburne Shipyard.

""This funding gives us a chance to harden infrastructure and build housing out of the floodplain,"" per WCAX.

Vermont just secured $68 million in federal community development block grants aimed at helping towns devastated by the 2023 floods build back stronger. The bulk of the funding targets Lamoille and Washington counties for infrastructure improvements, housing development, and planning initiatives. Governor Phil Scott emphasized the urgency of the investment as Vermont faces increasingly intense and isolated storms. The timing is particularly significant as Vermont grapples with potential changes to FEMA that could affect future disaster recovery efforts.

""The Department of Public Service, with the full support of Gov. Scott's team, is working with our affected colleagues nationally, as well as the Vermont Attorney General's Office, to pursue every opportunity including litigation to restore funding to this critical program,"" per VTDigger.

Vermont's Solar for All program, designed to reduce electricity costs for low-income households through solar installations, was killed Thursday evening when the EPA withdrew its $62.5 million grant. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the nationwide $7 billion initiative a ""grift"" with excessive administrative costs. The program, championed by Senator Bernie Sanders as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would have benefited renters in affordable housing developments with installations planned for early 2026. Commissioner Kerrick Johnson confirmed the state is exploring litigation alongside other affected states and tribes to restore the funding that was meant to address Vermont's energy burden disparities.

""Frankly, corrections agencies can't be good at everything and shouldn't be good at everything,"" per VTDigger.

Nick Deml steps down August 15 after nearly four years leading Vermont's prison system, passing the torch to former Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad. In his exit interview, Deml painted a picture of a corrections system stretched beyond its original mandate, now expected to provide education, substance use treatment, and community-standard healthcare while managing a workforce crisis that's seen vacancy rates drop from 32% to 15%. The pandemic fundamentally changed the inmate population, with people entering the system much sicker than before 2019. Despite investing $30 million in staff compensation and partnering with community organizations, Deml warns that corrections facilities have become the default endpoint for people cycling between homelessness, emergency rooms, and incarceration as other social safety nets fail.

""Sports are a place where people should be organizing,"" per VTDigger.

Vermont Green FC's championship season showcased more than athletic prowess, with fan-organized fundraisers collecting over $25,000 for Migrant Justice and the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund during the team's playoff run. The club's identity intertwines environmental justice with community activism, featuring halftime speeches from political leaders and advocates, themed nights supporting labor and pride movements, and banners declaring ""Abolish ICE"" alongside team colors. Co-founder Patrick Infurna acknowledges that while the political stance might alienate some potential fans, the club won't compromise on issues it considers urgent. The approach seems to be working: the national championship game sold out instantly with over 5,000 attendees, double the ticketed capacity, many drawn as much by the club's values as by the beautiful game itself.

[**Soundbites: Who Killed Nectar's?**](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/music/soundbites-who-killed-nectars-44153526?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-august-11th)

""Nectar's will no longer occupy the space that helped shape the soul of Burlington's music scene,"" per Seven Days.

The death of Nectar's came from a thousand cuts: Main Street construction that eliminated walk-up traffic, sky-high rent from landlord Joe Handy, changing demographics with Gen Z drinking less and seeking less live music, and perhaps most painfully, the venue's own identity crisis. When Ed Maier's ownership group took over in 2022, they pivoted hard toward making Nectar's a jam band shrine, losing the eclectic mix that had defined the club since 1975. Local bands stopped trying to book there as touring jam acts dominated the calendar. The loss stings particularly because it removes two stages from a city already hurting for venues. Yet Burlington's music scene adapts: Einstein's Tap House has built a new stage on the site of the legendary Club Toast, while the Skinny Pancake and Odd Fellows Hall ramp up their live music offerings.

""Troopers say no one was injured when a Burlington police officer shot at a driver early Sunday morning,"" per WCAX.

A Burlington police officer fired their weapon at a driver near 16 Prospect Hill around 12:40 a.m. Sunday during a search for a vehicle connected to a disturbance call. No injuries were reported in the incident, which is now under investigation by Vermont State Police. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation's completion. Following state police review, the case will move to the Vermont Attorney General's Office for an independent assessment of the use of force. The officer's identity will be released after the standard 24-hour waiting period.

""These 40 apartments will help people feel safe and secure in a home,"" per VTDigger.

Champlain Housing Trust and Evernorth broke ground Thursday on 100 Cambrian Way, bringing 40 permanently affordable apartments to Burlington's North End by next year. The $23.8 million project, powered by solar and geothermal energy, sets aside 10 units for Burlington Housing Authority voucher holders potentially transitioning out of homelessness. Average rents will run $1,325 for a one-bedroom, $1,530 for a two-bedroom, and $1,840 for a three-bedroom. The development represents the third affordable building at Cambrian Rise, with a fourth planned to add 30 affordable condos through CHT's shared equity program. State Treasurer Mike Pieciak called housing Vermont's number one economic issue, noting employers struggle to attract talent when workers can't afford to live here.

# This Week‚Äôs Restaurant Review: Gold Restaurant

Gold Restaurant brings a distinctive and intimate dining experience to Burlington‚Äôs Old North End, offering a modern, globally influenced take on Italian cuisine. Located on N. Winooski Avenue, the small dining room fosters a cozy atmosphere perfect for a date night or quiet meal with friends. Chef-owner Charles Spock‚Äôs menu is built around handmade pastas and seasonal ingredients, featuring clean, light preparations that stand apart from more traditional Italian-American fare. The positive buzz since last summer‚Äôs opening suggests it's a promising new fixture in the neighborhood.

The menu successfully showcases a creative culinary perspective. Seasonal ravioli, a standout brisket praised for its tenderness, and unique fusion dishes like a re-imagined Waterfall Beef highlight the kitchen‚Äôs range. Portions are generous for the price point, with most entr√©es landing under $25, and are complemented by a well-curated list of natural wines and cocktails. Friendly, attentive service further elevates the experience, making diners feel welcome from the moment they arrive in the warm, inviting space.

However, the very elements that define Gold may not appeal to all. The dining room‚Äôs small, 30-seat capacity creates intimacy but can also make securing a reservation challenging at times. Furthermore, the menu‚Äôs frequent changes, while a nod to seasonality, mean a beloved dish from one visit may be gone by the next. Diners looking for classic, red-sauce Italian comfort food will not find it here, as the focus is squarely on a modern, fusion-forward approach that, while inventive, may not suit every palate.

I love to imagine how he got his copy in the first place.

The black out curtains, etc you name it. Here is what did it for me to get better sleep.  I don‚Äôt do none of the herbs or tea stuff as I am just too lazy about that tbh. Some people swear by it.
  
I got tired of not being tired enough to fall asleep as soon as I needed to.  
  
Coffee 2 cups max, only consume first two hours of shift. Yes, some may have to go through an coffee withdrawal. I know this because I had to and it sucked. It‚Äôs an investment though.  
  
I go to a section of the room where there are no cameras where I can just do squats with a wall.  
  
Initially, I did this with pushups and yes my arms would get sore, but I wanted to be more tired (sounds weird).   
  
Now I just squat as much as possible. I instantly start sweating and all. By the time my version of 9 pm rolls around (2pm). I am TIRED and yawning hard. This alone has granted me from that average 4 hour of sleep to 5.5-6.5.  ‚ÄúBut you are not getting your 8-9 hours of sleep!‚Äù  I‚Äôve always slept 5.5-6.5 ever since I was a kid.   
  
Not saying this is healthy and maybe I should consult a sleep doctor, but I feel fine. 
  
I hope this helps some of you. I‚Äôm aware we are all different.

As for the benefits, I didn‚Äôt notice any increase in energy, focus, or mood after a couple of weeks. In fact, it left me feeling slightly bloated and uncomfortable after drinking . I‚Äôm glad others may have had a better experience, but for me, this was a waste of money. I‚Äôll be sticking to my regular coffee from now. 

The product and the way the subscription is set up both left a bad impression. I won‚Äôt be ordering again, and I‚Äôd recommend reading all the fine print before trying this brand.

1mo6n31,https://www.reddit.com/r/HairSystem/comments/1mo6n31/2_months_into_hair_systems_in_spanish_heat/,2 Months Into Hair Systems in Spanish Heat,"Hey!

I started wearing hair systems about two months ago. I‚Äôm originally from the Nordics, but I now live in the heat of Spain.

Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the transition ‚Äî I decided pretty early (around week two) to do all my maintenance myself. I currently have one 0.06 poly unit and one Swiss lace unit.

**Main challenge:**

Sweating. I sweat a lot, and going from the cool Nordics to Spanish summers hasn‚Äôt helped. I end up having to redo my hairline every 3‚Äì5 days and the entire system about every 10 days.

The issue isn‚Äôt actually cleaning or reapplying the system ‚Äî it‚Äôs that maintenance days (whether it‚Äôs just the hairline or the full system) mean I have to basically have around two days per week where I avoid almost all normal activities just so the bond can cure. Go for walk? I sweat,. No AC? I sweat. Doing the dishes? Sweat. Drink coffee? Sweat again. And of course, sweat ruins the bond.

It‚Äôs frustrating because it forces me to plan my week ‚Äî especially social life or dates ‚Äî around those days. The thought of my hairline lifting or turning white because the glue didn‚Äôt cure properly in the heat is why I put myself on lockdown for a full 24 hours every time.

My current strategy:

* Walker Scalp Protector
* Apply ConSeal glue (2 layers) in the front and Super Tape or Walker Ultra Hold around the perimeter before bed
* Do absolutely nothing until around 8 p.m. the next day

It works okay, but after 3‚Äì5 days my hairline won‚Äôt hold if I brush my hair back, which makes social or intimate moments a bit nerve-wracking.

**Other challenges:**

1. **Perimeter edges obvious to the touch** ‚Äì They‚Äôre not necessarily visible, but you can definitely feel them if you run your hand along the edge. I‚Äôve just ordered one 0.03 mm poly systems from GHY to try to make them less noticeable. Is there anything else I can do in the meantime?
2. **Hair colour matching** ‚Äì My natural colouring is very distinct (blonde with a tint of red). My workaround is ordering R22/613 and colouring with Fanola 9.3 (80%) + Fanola 8.34 (20%), which works fairly well.

Would love to hear if anyone‚Äôs found better solutions for sweating, perimeter blending (by touch), or niche hair colours like this in hot climates.",1,1754999693.0,HairSystem,3,1.0,False
1mo6n07,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1mo6n07/the_vance_legacy/,THE VANCE LEGACY,"The sharp, insistent beep of her alarm sliced through the pre-dawn silence. Evelyn Reed‚Äôs eyes snapped open, the ghost of her architectural dream‚Äîa seamless blend of glass and green space‚Äîfading into the dim reality of her cramped apartment. The scent of last night‚Äôs coffee and the pervasive, dusty smell of old paper clung to the air. A stack of bills sat on her nightstand, a silent, weighty reminder of the promise she had to keep.
Today was the day she fought for that promise.
Her fingers, calloused from hours of sketching, found her phone. The address was seared into her memory: ""The Gilded Mug,"" a small, unremarkable coffee shop. An odd place for a meeting that could decide the fate of the city's waterfront, a project worth billions. The secrecy of the client was a tight knot in her stomach, a puzzle she couldn't solve. Who was this person who held so much power, yet hid in the shadows?
She moved with a practiced, quiet urgency. A quick, cold shower. The charcoal gray power suit she wore only for her most important battles. Her dark hair was pulled back into a severe bun, a professional armor against the chaos of her mind. She needed to be a fortress of competence.
The city was just beginning its morning sigh as she stepped out. The low hum of the maglev trains, the first wave of sanitation drones, and the faint, sweet scent of jasmine from a nearby park wove together into the tapestry she so desperately wanted to shape. As she walked, the sky, once a bruised violet, began to weep. The first few drops of rain were cold pinpricks on her skin, a foretaste of the steady downpour to come.
The Gilded Mug was a haven of quiet warmth, smelling of roasted coffee and pastries. She scanned the room, expecting to see a corporate emissary. Instead, she saw a man alone in a secluded corner booth. He was in a simple dark trench coat, his back to her, and his stillness was unnerving. He wasn't on a datapad or a phone. He simply sat, completely still, watching the first drops of rain bead against the window. His presence was not just quiet; it was a void of noise, a silent point of gravity in the bustling room.
She approached him, her briefcase clutched like a shield. She felt a brief, uncontrollable tremor in her hand and tightened her grip, a small, involuntary movement of a woman bracing herself. ""Excuse me,"" she said, her voice a little steadier than she felt. ""Are you the representative for the waterfront project?""
The man turned, and the world tilted slightly on its axis.
He was younger than she expected, perhaps in his early thirties. His face was a stark study in contrasts: a jawline that could have been carved from marble, but his eyes held an almost haunting depth, the color of a stormy sea. A thin, white scar arced above his left eyebrow, a small crack in an otherwise perfect facade. His clothes, though simple, whispered of an impossible price tag.
He didn't speak. He simply watched her, his gaze unblinking and intense, as if he were cataloging every detail of her soul. She felt a shiver, a strange cocktail of challenge and something akin to fear. This was not a meeting; it was an inspection.
""Evelyn Reed,"" he finally said, his voice a low, resonant baritone that sent a jolt down her spine. ""I've been reviewing your firm's proposal."" He gestured to the empty chair. ""Please, sit.""
She sat, her mind racing to reconcile this man with the anonymous client. He was an enigma, a secret wrapped in an expensive coat. He offered no name, no handshake, just an unwavering gaze that was more intimidating than any show of force.
""Your proposal is different,"" he continued, a hint of something sharp and assessing in his tone. ""Most firms see the waterfront as a golden goose to be plucked. You‚Ä¶ you see it as a living heart for the city."" He leaned forward slightly, his posture a deliberate, controlled movement. ""Tell me, Evelyn. What drives you to take on the weight of an entire city on your shoulders?""
The question wasn't about her firm's plans. It was a knife's edge, a test. Evelyn felt the layers of her professional facade begin to crack. The easy answer was about her love for architecture, but the truth was a heavier, more personal burden. It was the crushing family debt, the late nights her mother worked, the ghosts of her father's failures. She paused for a beat, a brief moment of vulnerability, before answering.
She met his gaze, her own resolve hardening. ""A city's waterfront is its soul. My family gave me a foundation, and this city has given me a home. I believe we have a duty to give back to the things that build us. This isn't just a contract for me. It's a chance to build something that lasts. Something that heals.""
A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips, but it was accompanied by the faintest tightening at the corner of his mouth, gone before she could read it. He didn't respond to her passionate declaration. He simply watched her, his presence a heavy, silent weight in the room. The rain outside was now a steady, relentless drum against the window, a sound that mirrored the growing anxiety in her chest.
Finally, he spoke, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. ""This conversation is going to be very interesting, Miss Reed. I have a feeling you and I are going to have a lot to talk about.""
And in that moment, Evelyn knew with a chilling certainty that the fate of her family wasn't just in the hands of a mysterious billionaire. It was in the hands of this man, a powerful stranger who saw right through her professional armor, a man whose subtle movements hinted at a dangerous depth she couldn't yet comprehend. And she still didn‚Äôt know his name.",1,1754999686.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

I have known ‚ÄúSam‚Äù (35m) well for 5 years. He is my best friend‚Äôs stepbrother and we lived together during 2020 as nothing more than roommates (convenience, hard to find a rental - set up by my best friend).

I have known his family my whole life. I am close with them, often being invited out for coffees and for dinner/occasions etc. even when Sam or my friend won‚Äôt be there.

Sam has had a girlfriend for the last 2.5 years - it has been on and off and toxic that whole time. According to Sam and his dad, the relationship has now ended and they are looking to pay her out a sum of money so she will leave his house.

In 2022, Sam and I attended my best friend‚Äôs wedding (separately) and this was in an off period of his relationship. We got very drunk and fooled around, but didn‚Äôt have sex.

In 2023, I had Christmas at his family‚Äôs house and we ended up sleeping together that evening. Allegedly this was another ‚Äúoff‚Äù period with him and his ex‚Ä¶ and as skeptical as I would ordinarily be, he also didn‚Äôt receive any calls or messages from her during that time and didn‚Äôt seem inclined to ‚Äúhide‚Äù anything from me.

I haven‚Äôt seen him between then and now. I have continued to have sporadic contact with him, and he always makes comments about wanting to end up with me one day, wanting marriage etc.

But he is hopeless with communication. Even when we lived together, he‚Äôd text and call frequently when we were staying at the house at the same time, but if either of us was away, contact would effectively cease. If you are in front of him, you have his undivided attention, but otherwise you get virtually nothing.

A couple of days ago, he invited me out to dinner with his parents. I couldn‚Äôt make that dinner, having been called into work. Instead, we arranged to have brunch with his family the following morning. At the same time, he asked if I wanted to stay at his parents‚Äô house with him (he doesn‚Äôt live nearby to them, so was just visiting). I know his parents were in the background when he made that call.

He greeted me enthusiastically, called me babes and picked me up in a hug. All in front of his dad. The entire time I was there, he was showing affection in front of his parents.

When he went to have a shower after dinner, his dad pulled me aside and told me to be careful and to not get hurt by him. He said Sam thinks the world of me, and they would be over the moon if he ends up with me, but they have seen him upset women before and that I need to hold firm boundaries with him and not let myself get hurt. This made me worry about what they think he will do, but I didn‚Äôt ask.

The following morning, he was again affectionate in front of his parents and we went for a coffee together before we each went our separate ways. He again reiterated that we are a good team, that he wants to marry me one day, that he didn‚Äôt want to leave for work because he was enjoying it too much. I noticed he couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off me. There didn‚Äôt seem to be any post sex regret.

Since then, I have had a couple of texts from him but nothing else. We discussed possibly catching up again this week if our schedules work (we don‚Äôt live near each other - but he lives where my work is based so me being transferred there is a real possibility).

I am genuinely confused about what he wants. I keep thinking that he wouldn‚Äôt act that way in front of his family, knowing his family and I are very close and knowing his family would like him to end up with me‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt get his dads words out of my mind, and his lack of communication is hard to interpret.

For reference, he owns his own business and is by everyone‚Äôs account very busy - he‚Äôs a workaholic, and everyone says he‚Äôs hard to communicate with. But am I cutting him too much slack?

Any advice please!

Tl;dr: Is this guy just messing me around and is going to end up hurting me because he knows I like him, or is there a chance this ends up working out?",0,1754999569.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

the soft percussion of raindrops
tapping at the glass
like a gentle insistence‚Äî
like someone knocking,
but not urgently enough
for me to rise.

When I finally sat up,
the world outside was gray‚Äî
not the cruel kind of gray
that smothers,
but the tired kind
that needs a place to rest.

The coffee steamed in my hands,
and the windowpane
ran with patient rivers,
each one dragging some invisible
burden to the sill.
I watched them fall,
thinking of the nights
I‚Äôve tried to let go
and found myself heavier
for the effort.

Do clouds feel relief
when they finally break?
Or do they mourn
what they can never hold again?

Before this, the tooth had a filling which broke of and had slightly caused a cavitie but no pain. My dentist cleaned it out, prepped and shapped my thooth for the onlay, took the scan and filled it with a temporary onlay until the permanent one is fitted next week. 

Since the prep:

	‚Ä¢	Day 1: Took ibuprofen before bed just to be safe, no pain overnight.

	‚Ä¢	Day 2: Warm coffee ‚Äî no problem. Hot lunch ‚Äî mild, instant discomfort but goes away within 10-30 seconds.

	‚Ä¢	Cold food doesn‚Äôt really bother me, but hot food can trigger a quick ‚Äúpulling‚Äù sensation in the tooth that stops quickly after the food is gone.

	‚Ä¢	No throbbing, no lingering pain, no night pain. No pain when biting down on room temp food. 

I keep reading online that heat pain is usually worse news than cold pain, but I‚Äôm not sure if that applies after a tooth prep with a temporary onlay. Should I be concerned that the pulp might be failing, or is this just normal post-prep sensitivity?",1,1754999453.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1mo6hna,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1mo6hna/i_finally_shared_my_side_of_the_story_to_my/,"I finally shared my ""side"" of the story to my brother- and am disappointed, but not surprised to say the least","**Background: I** have been No Contact with my entire family since 2018. Including extended. I ran away, blocked everyone. Despite the abuse my entire life- this, that I typed below (from our conversation) is what happened the last time I stayed with my mom... She plays the victim and acts dumb as to why I cut her off, when the last words was that she would never see me again and she laughed. Brother and I reconnected recently due to mom having stroke and about to pass, him trying to get me to have a relationship with her. 

**Messed up Convo:** 

\-First, **he** told me not to come if I dont want a relationship with her but shed by me a ticket if I wanted to.¬†

**-I** told him I cant be directly involved and need to focus on school here. And that no one has acknowledged what has even happened to me.¬†

\-Then **he** said he doesnt know my side¬†of the story really and mom says she doesnt know why I left.

\-**I** told him:   
*""You know a lot more than you are admitting to- or choose to remember. In 2018, I came back to mom because I had lost everything and didn't know where else to go. I wasn't looking for handouts- I was looking for support from my mom. What I got instead was my things in trash bags and left in the rain. I was told that I was financially abusing her because I needed a ride and pads. You recorded me crying. You mocked me over things like coffee when I was already unstable. You gave me a black eye then saw mom yell at me and threaten to leave me stranded at a bus station, when alls I wanted was a ride 6 minutes away to leave her alone like she wanted. She screamed at me through the window, threatened to call the cops, and called me homeless and trash¬† and to live in dumpsters. After that, it was my breaking point. Extended families betrayed me by sharing what I confided in them with. Their loyalty will always be to the parents so it's not worth trying. Besides people treating me horribly my whole life, when my older brother was supposed to be protecting me- he was the one leading the pack.""*

**He** responded: *She has been through hell, and I'm not trying to make this a sob story an have you see her, I want her to be happy and healthy. If a relationship with you will be healthy than I think you should but if not then I don't think you should. I get if it's not a good time for you but she has done a lot for us, she's caused some stress and fights and screaming matches, but we also caused them to me.*¬†She did and is doing the best she can with what she has. You can relate... you went through some shit. But it made you stronger than ever

**My response?** *I can‚Äôt relate to her pain, but I understand it and that‚Äôs the closest thing to forgiveness- understanding why individuals do the things they do. But, that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to accept it. You both know why I left- you both were there- and the last words I said to her were that she‚Äôd never see me again and I‚Äôd never come back for anything. And I stayed true to that. Mom had support, infrastructure, safety nets, and access to resources/healing- IF she wanted. I had my belongings in trash bags in the rain then lost everything I‚Äôve ever owned, called abusive for asking for rides or period pads and left to fend for myself when I was already falling apart. Alone on holidays, on food stamps and rebuilding. I‚Äôve been in the hospital and never considered calling her. Ive had to make decisions with sloane at the emergency vet to surgeries on my own. I have had to pay for my education out of pocket and couch surf- while she has had everything handed to her growing up. I have had addiction and mental health problems- and despite Steve doing every thing he could to prevent me from getting help- I took the initiative. And made it happen myself. I have a savings account and never came back for money. For a healthy relationship this truth needs to be recognized without deflection. For a healthy relationship she needs to prove to me she is making an effort to get sober and better the rest of her life so she can live long and happy. Til then- I am at peace and value my life so so much.*¬†

*I literally begged her not to take me to x's  house while she laughed because he was in jail and a drug dealer and she left me with him all the time growing up. She took me to an empty apartment and snorted drugs in front of me on Christmas, and then asked me if I wanted any. She would text me suicide threats in the middle of the night or on weekends when I‚Äôm trying to enjoy myself with friends. She literally got in a drunk driving car accident in front of my face and blamed me for it. When I had no choice but to stay in that basement- I hung up my art and tapestries to try and be happy and make the best of it. She called it shit and accused me of destroying her house. If I asked for help, she‚Äôd tell me to take a shot. If I asked for her to keep my belongings, she threatened to give it to the people viewing her house at the time or in the trash. On the last Christmas with the whites, she told me that her parents ‚Äúcan‚Äôt stand me.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt get a single gift at that Christmas- and it wasn‚Äôt even about that. I watched all my girl cousins open up matching sentimental bracelets from grandma and I had to sit alone on the side to watch. These people treat me horribly. I don‚Äôt understand how you can‚Äôt see that? Despite all this I was still trying to have a relationship with you which says a lot.*

**He said he would read it later cause mom was in ICU again- and havent heard since lol. ITS LIKE- WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT WORLDS?!**

(cut to Dr Richard Taylor at Dec 2024 press conference: When the doctor performed the aspiration of the abdomen, the needle perforated the liver.)

(cut to JC: The nation heard that a doctor had killed a baby with a needle ‚Äì JM: Yeah. JC: And it‚Äôs not plausible.)

JM (off): And Letby‚Äôs original defence expert says these flaws are jeopardising her case.

(cut to MH: It seems to me that there‚Äôs a real danger that the flaws WILL be seen, and we find ourselves no further down the road in trying to get justice.)

JM (off): So who should we believe about Lucy Letby?

End of intro.

¬†

(18 Aug 2023: Newsreader off: A nurse who worked at a hospital in Chester has been found guilty of murdering babies in her care.)

JM (off): THIS is the day Lucy Letby was labelled a monster.

(footage of Cheshire police‚Äôs statement after verdict: ‚ÄòLucy Letby was entrusted to protect some of the most vulnerable babies. Little did those working alongside her know that there was a murderer in their midst.)

JM (off): She‚Äôs been convicted of unimaginable crimes ‚Äì the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of seven more.

(Newsreader off: It makes her the most prolific killer of children in modern times here in the UK.)

JM (off): At the time of Lucy Letby‚Äôs convictions, the world seemed convinced she was guilty. We interviewed one person who wasn‚Äôt.

(footage of 2023 Panorama with D: I‚Äôve grown up with Lucy and not a single thing that I‚Äôve ever seen of witnessed of Lucy would, you know, let me for a moment believe that she was capable of the things she was being accused of.)

JM (off): Back then, Lucy Letby‚Äôs friend was a lonely voice. She isn‚Äôt now.

(footage of ‚ÄòFree Lucy Letby‚Äô protesters in Liverpool)

JM (off): The campaign to free her grows louder by the day.

JM (in car): So here we go.

JC (driving): Bronzefield Prison.

JM: It‚Äôs here. Yeah.

JC: OK.

JM: Britain‚Äôs largest women‚Äôs prison. You wouldn‚Äôt know it was here! It‚Äôs just tucked away off the road.

JM (off): I‚Äôve spent almost three years investigating the Lucy Letby case with my colleague Jonathan Coffey. This is the third Panorama programme we‚Äôve made. We‚Äôve written a book about the case, too.

JC: So this is where Lucy Letby is imprisoned. And if she‚Äôs guilty‚Ä¶ many people will say this is where she belongs. Some will say it‚Äôs too good for her. You know, it‚Äôs not the worst prison. And if she‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just a horrendous miscarriage of justice. A woman in her mid-30s locked up wrongly.

JM: Those are the two extremes.

JC: One of them is wrong. I mean‚Ä¶

JM: Yeah, they can‚Äôt both be right.

JC: And we‚Äôre still arguing about the evidence‚Ä¶

JM: Mm‚Ä¶

JC: ‚Ä¶ two years after her convictions.

¬†

MM (arriving at his office): So we‚Äôre in my chambers, which is Furnival Chambers.

JM (off): The fact that so many people are now questioning Lucy Letby‚Äôs convictions is partly down to THIS man ‚Äì her new barrister.

MM: Down to the basement, which is where they keep all the pigeonholes and drawers of all our post. I get quite a lot of post in relation to Lucy, almost on a daily basis.

JM (off): Mark McDonald‚Äôs been working unpaid on the case for almost a year. His mission is to get Letby out of jail.

MM: These are messages for Lucy. I‚Äôve received hundreds of letters and hundreds of emails that come in and say, ‚ÄòHow can I help you?‚Äô

JC: Will you show them to her?

MM: I will tell her, and I will let her know that letters have arrived for her, books have arrived for her, and when she is released, she will have them all. Every single one of them.

¬†

JM (off): Letby has already tried and failed to appeal her convictions. Her last hope is the Criminal Cases Review Commission, or CCRC. It can ask the Court of Appeal to take another look, to re-examine her convictions for attacking premature babies in the neonatal unit of the CoCH.

JC (in a meeting room): So let‚Äôs remind ourselves, what Lucy Letby has been convicted of doing. (as he writes down) Air embolism ‚Äì injecting air into babies‚Äô circulation. Air in the stomach. Trauma ‚Äì inflicting trauma. Insulin poisoning. Dislodging breathing tubes‚Ä¶ I mean, they‚Äôre the key ones. Have I missed anything out?

JM: Oh! Overfeeding.

JC: Overfeeding‚Ä¶ There are so many different allegations and no direct evidence for any of them. I mean, no-one saw her do that, that, that, that, that or that.

JM: I hear you. No-one saw her. It‚Äôs circumstantial. There are so many cases built on circumstantial evidence. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs lesser evidence.

¬†

(footage of Feb 2025 press conference. SL: My name is Shoo Lee, and I‚Äôm here to share with you the findings of the international expert panel on the Lucy Letby case.)

JM (off): An international panel of 14 unpaid experts has been assembled for Lucy Letby‚Äôs defence. They‚Äôve looked at the medical evidence and reached a unanimous conclusion.

(footage of press conference: SL: Death or injury of all the affected infants were due either to natural causes or to errors in medical care. In summary, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find any murders.)

MM: It‚Äôs often said that a barrister shouldn‚Äôt say that their client is innocent‚Ä¶ that there‚Äôs reasonable doubt. But in this case, it‚Äôs wholly unusual because every expert that‚Äôs looked at this case, instructed by the defence, have said there is no crime‚Ä¶ which means if there‚Äôs no crime, there is an innocent woman in prison.

¬†

JM (off): This is the man Letby‚Äôs supporters blame ‚Äì the prosecution‚Äôs main expert witness.

DE (driving): I read a piece in the Guardian about‚Ä¶ Cheshire police investigating a number of baby deaths in Chester hospital. So I simply mentioned that this (chuckles) sounded like my kind of case!

JM (off): In 2017, retired paediatrician Dewi Evans offered to work on the investigation. He drove to Chester, and the police showed him the medical notes of one baby.

DE: My concerns were pretty rapid ‚Äì you know, within a matter of minutes, really. It struck me that this baby was the victim of significant inflicted injury, and that we were already looking at some kind of criminal event.

MM: He walks in to a meeting where he‚Äôs given a set of notes, and he looks at them, and whilst he‚Äôs drinking his coffee, within ten minutes, he knew what the pathologist didn‚Äôt know, what the treating clinicians didn‚Äôt know, what, you know, a plethora of reviews that had taken place in this hospital didn‚Äôt know. He knew, within ten minutes, whilst drinking his coffee, that this was an unlawful act against this child, that had led to the death of this child.

JM (off): For the next five years, Dr Evans was at the heart of the police investigation.

DE (in an office): What I discovered was that there were many deaths, seven of them, where there were grounds for thinking that they were due to inflicted injury. It was not my evidence alone. There was evidence from local nurses, and the local doctors, and the other independent witnesses. And this led to the conviction, which, in my opinion, is absolutely safe.

JM: How is it possible for other medics to look at the same material and say, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no evidence of deliberate harm‚Äô?

DE: That‚Äôs a question for them. And it may be that perhaps they don‚Äôt know as much as they think they do.

¬†

JM (off): One of the main critics of the prosecution‚Äôs case is Lucy Letby‚Äôs original defence expert. He‚Äôs a neonatologist who attended court throughout the ten-month long trial. My colleague Jonathan has been discussing the evidence with him over the past two years.

JC (greeting Dr Hall): Dr Hall.

MH: Hi, Jonathan.

JC: Hi. Good to see you.

JM (off): Mike Hall says the prosecution evidence simply doesn‚Äôt stack up.

MH: My opinion is that the jury was not given accurate information about the state of health of the babies prior to their collapse. They were showing signs of being unwell. In terms of the summary reports of the expert panel, the bottom line is that I agree with them, that there is no evidence of inflicted injury in the babies.

¬†

JM (off): One of the clearest problems with the prosecution evidence involves Baby C. He died at just four days old. Lucy Letby was alone with him when he collapsed.

JC: What went wrong with the prosecution‚Äôs case on Baby C, in your view?

MH: Some of what they said was medically incompetent, actually. And it is my opinion that the basis in which Lucy Letby was convicted with regard to Baby C is seriously flawed.

JM (off): The prosecution said Letby killed Baby C by injecting air into his stomach.

(footage of Panorama 2024: SB: In several of the cases in the trial, babies collapsed and when the abdomen was X-rayed, had huge amounts of gas. And if that happens, that pushes up on the diaphragms \[sic\] and makes it very difficult for babies to take a breath. And eventually babies will stop breathing, because they just can‚Äôt take a breath in.)

JM (off): But there was a problem. An important piece of evidence was an X-ray showing air in Baby C‚Äôs stomach, taken 41 hours before he died. The prosecution‚Äôs expert said it was suspicious.

JM (facing camera): but it turned out Lucy Letby wasn‚Äôt on duty that day.

JM (off): The jury was told this before they found Letby guilty. But there was another problem. The main prosecution expert has changed his mind about Baby C‚Äôs death. In one of his pre-trial reports, Dewi Evans said, ‚ÄòWe may never know the cause, as the baby was at great risk of unexpected collapse.‚Äô The first time he said air injected into the stomach caused the baby‚Äôs death was in the witness box. Under cross-examination, he also suggested another possible cause of death ‚Äì air injected intravenously into the blood. This was all explained to the jury. The prosecution barrister even told them they could disregard Dr Evans‚Äô evidence on Baby C. After the trial, Dr Evans wrote another report. Air in the blood was now the most likely cause.

MM: He‚Äôs changed his mind on one of the murder cases, to which he says, ‚ÄòActually, this is not how the baby died. I‚Äôll tell you what. I‚Äôm going to write a new report.‚Äô Writes a new report a year after ‚Äì a year after she‚Äôs convicted ‚Äì and gives it to the police. And here‚Äôs the issue here. If he is changing his mind, if he is questioning what he is saying, undermining his evidence that he gives at trial, what else is there to say about him and his other evidence at trial?

¬†

JM (to DE): This changing of position between different possible causes is leading to people arguing that the whole thing is flawed. Can you see that?

DE: My opinion was that this baby was a victim of inflicted injury, and whether this was air into the stomach or air into the bloodstream, or a combination of both, they all represent deliberate harm.

JM: If you can‚Äôt be certain of which of those two causes‚Ä¶

DE: Does that matter?

JM: Well, there are many who say it does.

DE: It does not. Both reflect inflicted injury, deliberate harm. In other words, murder.

¬†

JM (to JC): It‚Äôs not like you had a situation where you were saying, ‚ÄòThis person was shot. Actually, sorry, no, there‚Äôs no gunshot wounds at all. I‚Äôve decided instead they drowned.‚Äô That‚Äôs NOT what we‚Äôre dealing with here. He‚Äôs looking‚Ä¶

JC (interrupting): Some people would say that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre dealing with.

JM: I know they would, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it came over.

JC: Air into the stomach and air into the bloodstream are very different things, and to just slide from one theory to the other‚Ä¶ I think makes it sound like you don‚Äôt really know what happened.

JM: It‚Äôs certainly a really difficult case to get your head around.

JC: Well, some people would say it‚Äôs not a difficult case to get your head around. That, actually, they HAVE got their head around it, and the prosecution expert evidence is all over the place.

JM: Yeah. And other people would say they got their head around it and convicted her. The jury got their head around it to the extent that they convicted her.

¬†

JM (off): When it comes to the Letby case, there are two parallel worlds ‚Äì one where the evidence and her guilt are fiercely disputed‚Ä¶ and another where her convictions are written in stone.

(footage of Thirlwall Inquiry, Lady Thirlwall: There has been a huge outpouring of comment from a variety of quarters on the validity of the convictions.)

JM (off): A public inquiry is investigating the hospital where Lucy Letby worked. It takes her guilt as beyond question.

(Lady Thirlwall: All of this noise has caused enormous additional distress to the parents, who have already suffered far too much.)

JM (off): The families have spoken out.

Actor‚Äôs voice, Mother of Baby C, statement to Public Inquiry: The media PR campaign aimed to garner public sympathy for Letby demonstrates a complete lack of understanding for Letby‚Äôs crimes and the complexity of the case.

Actor‚Äôs voice, Family of Baby G, statement to Public Inquiry: Family G now have to avoid watching the television, reading newspapers and accessing social media to protect themselves from the mostly inaccurate and often biased and toxic messages that are being reported and published.

Actor‚Äôs voice, Mother of Babies E and F, interview with The Times: Certain pieces of evidence being discussed in the media are grossly out of context and misrepresented. We would like to say, ‚ÄòShame on you all.‚Äô

MM (hailing a black cab): Going to the House of Commons.

MM: So we‚Äôre going to meet David Davies MP, who has from almost the beginning been raising concerns about Lucy Letby. And this is really an update as to where I am on the case.

¬†

JM (off): There‚Äôs anow an army of experts publicly supporting Letby‚Äôs case. But at her trial, Lucy Letby‚Äôs defence didn‚Äôt call a single medical expert to give evidence. It‚Äôs why many people think her conviction was unfair.

MH: Well, when I found out that I wasn‚Äôt going to be called to give evidence, or indeed that nobody else was going to be called to give evidence, I couldn‚Äôt believe it, because I could not see how a fair process could possibly occur without some rebuttal of the evidence, particularly the medical evidence, which had been provided to the jury.

JC: Were you given a reason?

MH: No. No, I wasn‚Äôt.

JC: Do you think Lucy Letby is innocent?

MH: I don‚Äôt know whether Lucy Letby is innocent, but in terms of natural justice, I don‚Äôt think that she should have been found guilty.

¬†

JC (to NM): Do you believe any of the allegations against Lucy Letby stack up?

NM: We conclude that there are very, very plausible alternative explanations, and that the accusations of wrongdoing‚Ä¶ that have been put towards the jury simply don‚Äôt stack up. It‚Äôs highly likely that what we‚Äôre witnessing is a major miscarriage of justice.

¬†

JM (off): But are the new defence experts right?

DE: Every case I‚Äôve seen presented by Mark McDonald and his international panel contains information that is frankly inaccurate. It‚Äôs WRONG. He‚Äôs done no favours to his client at all. Any competent barrister would be able to dismantle, unravel the conclusions that the international panel reached.

JM (off): What‚Äôs surprising is that Letby‚Äôs original defence expert partly agrees. He‚Äôs not part of the international panel, and he believes there are problems with its reports.

MH: I think there are some significant flaws in the reports. For a number of the babies, I think they are important, really, and I think a problem is that it could lead to misunderstanding on the part of people who don‚Äôt have experience in this area of medicine.

JM (off): Take Baby A. Letby‚Äôs international panel says he died from a blood clot after inheriting a rare condition from his mother, but there‚Äôs little evidence to support that claim.

DE: The international panel says the baby died of a clot in the artery that supplies the back of the brain. This is erroneous. There was no evidence found on autopsy at all. And they claim that this may be overlooked, which‚Ä¶ is really pushing the limits of credibility.

MH: The possibility that the mother‚Äôs condition had in some way caused the babies to collapse was explored at the trial, and the jury were offered that option of an explanation. And obviously they rejected that. And I‚Äôm not sure that the expert witnesses have added anything to that conversation.

JM (off): Then there‚Äôs Baby I. Letby‚Äôs experts say she died in part because of a bug that doctors failed to treat. Once again, Letby‚Äôs original defence expert says the evidence isn‚Äôt there.

MH: The information of which I‚Äôm aware, relating to this bug, that it was last found, identified, about six weeks before Baby I sadly died, and it wasn‚Äôt identified in the postmortem report. And so the information which I have about this bug doesn‚Äôt lead me to the conclusion that it was a significant cause in the events leading to the baby‚Äôs death.

JC: Do you have an opinion on Mark McDonald‚Äôs approach?

MH: It seems to me that there‚Äôs a real danger it will rebound.

JC: In what way?

MH: In that the flaws WILL be seen‚Ä¶ and we find ourselves no further down the road in trying to get justice, or at least a fair trial.

¬†

JM (to MM): Do you accept there are any flaws in any of the reports your experts have written?

MM: No. Do I accept that there are flaws? No, I don‚Äôt. I got the best in the world. I got the BEST in the world. Compared to the evidence that was called at the trial, this is MOUNTAINS above them and their skillset.

¬†

JM (to JC): It‚Äôs amazing, isn‚Äôt it, the degree to which different opinions, different expert opinions will turn the tide of a case.

JC: But I think that‚Äôs terrifying, because your fate hangs on which experts are on your side and which experts are on the prosecution side. That‚Äôs no way to create confidence in the outcome of criminal trials that are heavily dependent on expert witnesses.

JM (off): Letby‚Äôs new experts do have serious arguments. There is one challenge that could, if true, really undermine the prosecution case.

JM (facing camera): Lucy Letby was convinced of injecting air into babies‚Äô blood, causing a blockage in the circulation. It‚Äôs called an air embolism.

JM (off): Lucy Letby was convicted of murdering seven babies, and the prosecution argued up to six of those attacks involved air embolism. So what was the evidence that convicted her?

(footage Panorama 2024, SB: The babies that collapsed or died of air embolism were babies that were stable beforehand, showing no signs of illness, and then underwent a sudden and catastrophic collapse. And how to you explain that? Why did this baby collapse and then have air where it shouldn‚Äôt have had air after death? So, having crossed off all the likely things, you then have to look at unlikely and rare and unthinkable things like air embolus.)

JM (off): During the trial, the prosecution relied on this academic paper examining air embolism in babies. One of the symptoms it found was unusual skin rashes. The prosecution said some of the babies in Letby‚Äôs care showed similar rashes. Now, the expert who wrote that scientific paper is campaigning for Lucy Letby‚Äôs release.

(Footage press conference Feb 2025. SL: The notion that these babies can be diagnosed with air embolism because they collapsed and had these skin discolorations has no evidence in fact.)

JM (off): The expert panel says there are no reported cases of skin rashes where newborn babies have had air injected into their VEINS.

NM: The prosecution‚Äôs allegations put forward some highly speculative ‚Äì in the case of air embolism ‚Äì highly speculative suggestions. Why jump onto an allegation of air embolism when other, more plausible explanations exist?

JM (off): If Lucy Letby‚Äôs new experts are right about air embolism, they will have undermined key evidence in six out of the seven murder cases. But that might not get her out of jail. The judge told the jury that if they were convinced Letby was guilty of one offence, they could use that to support a conviction on other charges.

KV: It‚Äôs a direction that judges regularly give to juries throughout the country every day, and basically what it means in layman‚Äôs terms is that, if a jury comes to the sure conclusion in respect of one of the allegations that a defendant has done something in a certain way, then that evidence can be used as some support for the prosecution‚Äôs case in respect of the other allegations.",3,1754998981.0,LucyLetbyTrials,0,1.0,False

*Except poor Eulogio, who headed downstate for his week of Managers meetings. But his eyes were gleaming because he has a clearer purpose and plan. He considers the Field/Pool/Gym/Rink as ‚Äúdone‚Äù and he is already thinking about next steps: the final two buildings (Art/Music/Drama and Secondary School) and the perimeter ‚Äúforest.‚Äù He himself is really inspired by the work of the Consultants. ‚Äú‚ÄôThe Tour of the Longhouse School‚Äô has all we need,‚Äù he says. Eulogio is a dangerous Wyatt Earp gunslinger when he is in that frame of certitude.*

*üò≠We said good-bye yesterday morning to True, Bob, and the strapping, gallant four grands! It was a pleasure and treasure to spend so much time with them this summer! But the boys begged to spend ‚Äújust one more day‚Äù at the RV Park Camp. In exchange, Bob and True extracted all types of promises from them.*

Guy took the kids to daycare but Dee. and I had coffee with them and they shared with us some thoughts for this new post about Daisaku Ikeda‚Äôs [lecture](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/the-three-powerful-enemies-part-2-confronting-the-most-formidable-enemy-arrogant-false-sages/). We looked at the second powerful enemy, defined as ‚Äúarrogant priests.‚Äù The Daishonin provides the example of ‚Äúmen like Honen who disregard the precepts and hold perverse views‚Äù (WND-1, 274). He then outlines in some detail why they can be considered evil.

I want to start with some of the background information provided by Daisaku Ikeda:

>The Pure Land (Nembutsu) school of Buddhism, which was founded by Honen, belittles people‚Äôs capacity for understanding the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of Law‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBelittles people‚Äôs capacity for understanding?‚Äù 

This reminds me of the tone of so many posts at Sgiwhistleblowers. ‚ÄúWe don't need much more than an AI-generated image each hour to keep our kiddies entertained and in line. Let's also plaster the posts with the boogie-man term ‚Äòcult‚Äô a dozen times each day. That will surely scare the kiddies!‚Äù

Of course, most SGI members chant now and then. Well, that sounds much like how my Christian friends pray. There are cult members like us who are in the second category of trying to make the monthly discussion meeting. There are such severe demands placed on us!

Statistics? I don't have any beyond what I see in our group and district. Bob asked us to look at Pew Research‚Äôs [findings](https://share.google/o4gpR8wRmRZcY3l7b) on Catholics‚Äô participation in rites and observances: about half of Catholics attend Mass occasionally. ‚ÄúI mean, they've had centuries to build neighborhood churches, institutional supports, and cultural expectations. I don't think we come anywhere close to their participation rates. Yet, the heavy posters at Whistleblowers think they have an audience of such limited capacity to understand that they would take the bait and equate *low* participation rates to cult behavior!‚Äù

I want to add another logical fallacy. On odd days some WBers claim that 95-99% SGI members around the world have discarded their practice and the SGI is crumbling right in front of our eyes. Then, on even days, they claim this is such an insidious and regimented cult that no one could escape without many years of efforts. Huh???

Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based maker of rare-earth magnets, has raised $65 million in Series A funding at a $250 million valuation.

**Why it matters:**¬†The U.S. is pushing to onshore production of materials critical to its national defense, plus commercial needs, rather than relying on China.

* Rare-earth magnets also have been a bone of contention in U.S.-China trade talks.

\*\*What they're saying: ""\*\*We have contracts with every branch of the military already, Navy, Army and Air Force, and we're ... doing initial deliveries on one of those contracts this month,"" Vulcan CEO John Maslin tells Axios.

* ""The picks and shovels of reindustrialization, the picks and shovels of the 21st century technology race? Chips, batteries and magnets. These magnets are going exponential in defense applications. Think drone technologies; think about the president's executive order on unleashing drone dominance. We need a lot of additional rare-earth magnets.""

**Zoom in:**¬†Altimeter led the funding round, joined by One Investment Management.

The bottom line:¬†China's recent restrictions/crackdowns have spooked defense players and pushed supply chain discussions to the fore, much like how COVID did for the average Joe.""

**Despite their name, rare earth elements are relatively abundant. However, economically viable deposits exist in just a few countries, making it difficult to source large quantities for manufacturing. Extraction is also expensive, so only a limited number of mining companies have the resources needed to launch full-scale operations.**

While¬†[China](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions)¬†and the United States lead global production of REEs, several other countries also have sizeable deposits.

# China

* **Annual production:**¬†270,000 metric tons
* **Known reserves:**¬†44 million metric tons
* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†China's government views REEs as a critical resource, so it uses¬†[state-controlled enterprises](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/mapping-chinas-strategy-for-rare-earths-dominance/)¬†for all production and refining activities. Due to the environmental effects of rare earth operations, the Chinese government has also taken steps to shut down illegal mining operations and punish refining companies that don't comply with environmental regulations.

# United States

* **Annual production:**¬†45,000 metric tons
* **Known reserves:**¬†1.8 million metric tons
* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†The United States is heavily dependent on China for rare-earth refining, as China controls almost all global refining capacity.

* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†Australia has a¬†[Critical Minerals Facility](https://www.exportfinance.gov.au/criticalminerals), giving private companies access to funding and other resources for rare-earth mineral projects. The Australian government has also partnered with the United States, Japan, and the European Union to reduce reliance on China. Australia has strict environmental laws, so the national government is investing in green chemistry techniques and other methods for reducing the pollution associated with¬†[rare earth mining](https://qz.com/1988240/rare-earths-mining-takes-center-stage-in-greenland-elections)¬†and processing.

# Thailand

* **Annual production:**¬†7,100 metric tons
* **Known reserves:**¬†4,500 metric tons
* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†Thailand has limited reserves, but it's located near several countries known for their electronics and EV production, enhancing its strategic importance. From an environmental perspective, mining and processing companies need to know that rare-earth deposits are often found in areas with¬†[sensitive ecosystems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935124008727).

# Vietnam¬†

* **Annual production:**¬†600 metric tons
* **Known reserves:**¬†22 million metric tons
* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†The Vietnamese government has finalized¬†[memoranda of understanding with Australia](https://www.exportfinance.gov.au/newsroom/export-finance-australia-and-vietnam-development-bank-partner-to-deepen-trade-and-investment/)¬†and other countries, opening up new opportunities for trade and investment. Government officials are also working on updating the country's laws to align with the current demand for rare-earth mining and refining. Like Thailand, Vietnam has some ecologically sensitive regions, so government agencies and private companies must be aware of the increased risk of deforestation, soil erosion, and other types of environmental damage.

# Brazil

* **Annual production:**¬†80 metric tons
* **Known reserves:**¬†21 million metric tons
* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†Although its annual production is quite low, Brazil has some of the largest untapped reserves in the world. With proper investment, it could offer other countries a valuable opportunity to diversify away from China. However, Brazil doesn't have much refining capacity, and its¬†[permitting process](https://aria.law.columbia.edu/mining-arbitration-in-brazil/)¬†is rather complicated. Many mining operations are also located near the Amazon rainforest and other sensitive areas.

# Russia

* **Annual production:**¬†2,600 metric tons
* **Known reserves:**¬†10 million metric tons
* **Geopolitical and environmental factors.**¬†Like China, Russia uses several state-controlled firms to mine for rare-earth elements. However, due to sanctions from multiple countries, Russia isn't well-integrated into the global supply chain, limiting export opportunities. Minerals mined in Russia are also likely to contain¬†[radioactive materials](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-from-rare-earths-deposits), increasing the risk of harm.

# Why country-level rare earth control matters

Control over rare earth elements gives countries significant economic, technological, and geopolitical power. Nations with large deposits can use this advantage to gain leverage in¬†[trade disputes](https://qz.com/rare-earth-minerals-china-us-trade-war)¬†and other political matters. For example, China uses export controls to ensure domestic companies have enough REEs to meet their production goals before other countries can import what they need.

REEs are also critical for national defense and technology development. Countries with large reserves have more options when it comes to producing missiles, military vehicles, and other defense equipment. Rare earth metals are found in almost every electronic item on the market, so they can also make or break a country's economy.

The¬†[global supply chain](https://qz.com/rare-earth-element-mineral-mine-tech-supply-chain-1851337725)¬†is also relatively fragile. Few countries have economically viable deposits, so even minor issues can result in reduced supply for months or even years. For example, a refining facility in Vietnam had to shut down due to tax problems, leading to reduced global refining capabilities.

Finally, China controls much of the refining activity, making it difficult for companies in other countries to estimate annual supply. If China implements additional restrictions or shuts down some of its state-owned enterprises, the global supply of purified REEs could dwindle.

# What's next for rare earths?

Global demand for rare earths continues to rise, driven by the growing need for advanced technology, clean energy, and electric vehicles. To meet this demand, nations with viable deposits should focus on adding mining and refining capacity.

[Circular solutions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666049022000354)¬†focus on reusing and recycling rare-earth elements along with reducing their consumption whenever possible. This minimizes waste and reduces demand for new rare-earth materials.¬†[Strategic alliances](https://qz.com/1971108/chinese-rare-earths-giant-shenghe-is-building-global-alliances)¬†and trade agreements are also essential, especially for countries with lower reserves or limited production capabilities.

The environmental impact of mining rare earth elements will always be a concern. For example, refining can cause¬†[heavy metals](https://ips-dc.org/mapping-the-impact-and-conflicts-of-rare-earth-elements/)¬†to build up in the water supply, increasing the risk of health problems. Production and refining also require large amounts of water.

Mining and refining companies can't completely eliminate these problems, but buyers can help by focusing on¬†[ethical sourcing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168127320300167)¬†‚Äî choosing suppliers that reduce water use, limit pollution, and uphold environmental standards.¬†

# AUGUST 11th, 2025~U.S.-China Trade War Escalates as Nations Accelerate Critical Mineral Strategies and Energy Supply Chain Realignments

[Technology Metals Report (04.11.2025): U.S.-China Trade War Escalates as Nations Accelerate Critical Mineral Strategies and Energy Supply Chain Realignments - InvestorNews](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/technology-metals-report-04-11-2025-u-s-china-trade-war-escalates-as-nations-accelerate-critical-mineral-strategies-and-energy-supply-chain-realignments/)

*(A Few items of interest as article was shortend)...*

**This past week marked a notable acceleration in trade hostilities, national policy shifts, and corporate maneuvering across the global energy and critical minerals ecosystem. From Washington to Beijing, Riyadh to La Rochelle, senior decision-makers acted swiftly to reposition industries against the backdrop of rising tariffs, supply insecurity, and mounting geopolitical stakes.**

China intensified its trade retaliation by raising¬†[tariffs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/china-strikes-back-with-125percent-tariffs-on-us-goods-starting-april-12.html)¬†on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, following President Trump‚Äôs escalating country-specific levies. American duties on Chinese imports now total 145%. Beijing‚Äôs Ministry of Finance labeled further escalation ‚Äúpointless,‚Äù given current trade dynamics, yet no bilateral talks have been scheduled. The economic impact is already rippling through global markets‚ÄîGoldman Sachs revised its GDP forecast for China downward to 4%, citing elevated trade friction and slowing growth.

Against this volatile backdrop, the U.S. Department of Energy, under Secretary Chris Wright,¬†[announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-acts-unleash-american-coal-strengthening-coal-technology-and-securing#:~:text=In%20coordination%20with%20the%20Department,upcoming%202025%20Critical%20Materials%20Assessment.)¬†a sweeping initiative to revive domestic coal infrastructure and critical mineral supply chains. In alignment with a new executive order, the DOE reinstated the National Coal Council, recommended steelmaking coal be designated a critical material, and committed $200 billion in financing through the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program. It also announced expanded commercialization of NETL-patented technology to extract critical minerals from coal ash, signaling a broader push to reindustrialize domestic supply capabilities and reduce dependence on Chinese sources.

The week also saw the¬†[publication](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/breaking-the-cmi-critical-minerals-list-2025-a-strategic-blueprint-for-global-technology-defense-and-economic-security/)¬†of the 2025 Critical Minerals List by the¬†[Critical Minerals Institute](https://criticalmineralsinstitute.com/)¬†(CMI), identifying 23 minerals essential to global technology, defense, and economic stability. The list, derived from a comparative analysis of twelve international lists, includes only those materials appearing in at least seven. Copper, uranium, gallium, rare earths, and cobalt were named top priorities, selected based on concentration of supply risk, substitution limitations, and long-term demand. The CMI‚Äôs release underscores the intensifying global competition to secure strategic resources.

I**n the Middle East, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs state-owned mining company Ma‚Äôaden**¬†[**announced**](https://www.agbi.com/mining/2025/04/maaden-seeks-foreign-partner-for-rare-earth-processing/)¬†**it is evaluating four potential foreign partners to co-develop a rare earth processing facility. MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Shenghe Resources, Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (ASX: LYC), and**¬†[**Neo Performance Materials Inc.**](https://www.neomaterials.com/)¬†**(TSX: NEO) are under consideration. A final decision is expected by June, with feasibility planning running through year-end. The initiative aligns with the Kingdom‚Äôs Vision 2030 strategy to develop domestic processing and magnet manufacturing capacity.**

The global nuclear sector saw renewed urgency for upstream investment. A joint report by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency¬†[projected](https://www.ft.com/content/6cbebe7f-7c56-4e35-9d6b-ed2207887d81)¬†that currently identified uranium resources could be exhausted by the 2080s under a high-growth demand scenario. While adequate resources exist in theory, both agencies emphasized the need for near-term exploration and mine development to maintain energy security. Kazakhstan remains the dominant uranium supplier, but its recent shift toward supplying China and Russia at the expense of Western markets has introduced new vulnerabilities.

***\*\*\~Sharing my speculatons on putting it all togther for Scandium posibilities moving forward T.B.D.\~***

# (***Mark Smith) ~NioCorp: ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of Scandium‚Äù in the Making hmmm.....

*NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek project is emerging as the only credible near-term, large-scale domestic scandium source ‚Äî potentially (speculative Q-4 2025 DFS??) producing \~150 +/- t/year by 2027‚Äì2028.*

*This scale could anchor U.S. supply security for critical aluminum alloys used in EVs, defense platforms, and aerospace. Scandium‚Äôs ability to dramatically boost weldability, strength, and fatigue life makes it ideal for Ford‚Äôs newly announced ‚Äúunicast‚Äù aluminum EV platforms and Stellantis‚Äô lightweighting ambitions, while aligning perfectly with Lockheed Martin and other defense primes‚Äô need for stronger, more corrosion-resistant airframes and naval components.*

**Behind-the-Scenes Drivers & Probabilities**  
The probability of trials and alloy qualification within 12‚Äì24 months is high (70‚Äì85%), with early use in premium or safety-critical parts (20‚Äì35% probability for first-wave production by 2027). The DoD‚Äôs interest is not hypothetical ‚Äî scandium is on its critical minerals list, and the Defense Production Act and National Defense Stockpile both allow for multi-year offtake contracts and price supports. If secured, these would de-risk financing and send a strong market signal. Stellantis is a likely contender for early supply alongside Ford, with speculation that international strategic funds such as Saudi Arabia‚Äôs PIF may also enter the mix to lock up access for global EV and aerospace ventures.

**""IF""**\- NioCorp executes on its current trajectory, it won‚Äôt just be¬†*another*¬†supplier ‚Äî it will be the¬†**flagship U.S. source**¬†for multiple critical minerals at once,¬†**uniquely DFARS-compliant**, and aligned with both defense and clean energy priorities. That would make it¬†**indispensable**¬†to the U.S. industrial base and its allies going into 2028 and beyond.¬†

¬†**NioCorp Developments Ltd.¬†represents the emerging model for a fully U.S.-based, vertically integrated critical minerals supplier**.

The company has distributed mineral samples to national labs (AMES), defense-linked programs (such as Project Pivot), and aerospace innovators (Boeing U.K. & IBC), and has confirmed active talks with both government and private-sector buyers. Its current infill drilling campaign (completing August 2025)¬†**and forthcoming DFS (Q4 2025 per Mark Smith**)¬†[NioCorp Can Make America the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of Scandium,‚Äù CEO Mark Smith Tells Fox Business‚Äô Maria Bartiromo | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-can-make-america-the-saudi-arabia-of-scandium-ceo-mark-smith-tells-fox-business-maria-bartiromo/)¬†Could significantly expand projected output ‚Äî positioning it to begin construction in May 2026?? and production by mid-2028¬†**(all T.B.D.

Trump's takeover of the Metro Police and National Guard will save hundreds of lives.,"I live in a Northern Virginia suburb. If you know anything about Northern Virginia, it is one of the wealthiest, safest, and most liberal areas in the United States. For some time, my Congressional district had the longest life expectancy in the entire U.S. This is all to say -- I am a liberal in a safe and cushy area, and I have a good baseline for what a safe and prospering community should look like. 

So when I cross the Potomac River into D.C. and see the stark desolation before me, I am shaken to my core. Less than a tenth of a mile from the Virginia border, you are faced with something out of a Mad Max movie: Washington, D.C.

From my direction, you come right upon the Kennedy Center and the National Mall first. You'll notice right away the crime and desolation driving through the latter -- food trucks parked illegally, selling ice cream and hot dogs at exorbitant prices. As you head towards Capitol Hill, you will see the occasional elderly black man sitting outside a CVS, quietly asking for change. At a couple of street corners, you will see homeless people in orange vests selling newspapers on the corner to raise money for shelters. It reminds me of walking through New York City in the aftermath of 9/11, through the rubble and ashes. Don't even get me started on heading to Navy Yard to catch a baseball game, where you have to bypass intimidating people selling overpriced water bottles and playing drums for tips outside of the 18th Compass Coffee you've seen that day.

Also, there are fucking lions in the National Zoo. Every day I go to work, I am worried about being eaten by a fucking lion. 

What if I don't want to drive through the D.C. traffic? You end up on the metro, which is one of the seediest underbellies you have ever seen. Sometimes, you will be on a near-empty platform and a gentleman of a different race will be a couple of dozen feet away, standing there, menacingly. Or even worse, a gang of youths will be talking in loud voices and playing hip hop. Or, even worse, it will be crowded because there are too many consultants commuting to work and I will have to stand up on the train, which is a bitch when you get a conductor who makes abrupt stops.

For these reasons and more, I am looking forward to the reassuring presence of ICE, the DEA, a revamped Metro Police, and the National Guard at as many street corners as possible. When I take my lunch break and walk two blocks to get my $17 salad bowl from one of the fifteen places with names like 'SweetGreen' and 'FreshLeaf,' I will no longer have to worry about getting shot in front of the frozen yogurt spot.

1mo6631,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepIndianConfessions/comments/1mo6631/boarding_gate_23/,Boarding Gate 23,"The Boarding Gate 23 had people who had been waiting too long. The board flashed¬†*‚ÄúDelayed ‚Äì 2 hours‚Äù*, and the displeasure around me seemed almost the same. I sat near a charging point, headphones in, scrolling through my dating app , left swipes and no matches, the kind of frustration you don‚Äôt admit out loud.

That‚Äôs when I noticed her.

She was somewhere in her late twenties , dusky skin with only the South Indian sun could give. Her black hair was long and slightly wavy, falling over one shoulder . There was a small mole near her upper lip, the kind you notice once and then can‚Äôt stop noticing. And her eyes ...Ohhhh Damnn.... saying things about things they weren‚Äôt saying.

She was two rows ahead, a travel pillow looped around her neck, scrolling her phone like she was killing time but her eyes kept drifting my way. Once, twice, again. The fourth time, she didn‚Äôt look away so quickly.

Ten minutes later, she was in front of me.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúdo you have a charger? I think we have the same phone.‚Äù

I nodded toward the socket next to me. ‚ÄúYeah. Go ahead.‚Äù

She plugged in her phone and took the seat beside me. The elbow brush was accidental, but the warmth lingered a little too long. We started talking ,small things at first. But somewhere between flight delays and bad coffee, she told me why she was tense.

She had been called to Chennai for her visa interview. With the delay, we would land late ,too late for restaurants or hotels to be open. She hadn‚Äôt booked anything yet.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll stay tonight,‚Äù she admitted, her voice carrying a mix of worry and fatigue.

I thought for a second, then said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a 2BHK in Chennai. One room‚Äôs empty, you‚Äôd have complete privacy.‚Äù

She hesitated, eyes narrowing slightly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ generous, but........‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt press. ‚ÄúAlright. Try for a hotel first. If nothing works out, call me. I will keep the room ready. Only problem it‚Äôs a bit far from the consulate.‚Äù

She gave me a long look, then smiled faintly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt need to trouble you.‚Äù

When boarding was called, we went our separate ways , different rows, different seats. But I caught her looking over more than once during the flight.

Outside the terminal in Chennai, the air was warm and heavy. I spotted her near the taxi line, phone in hand, speaking quickly in half-whispers.

‚ÄúNo luck?‚Äù I asked, stepping up beside her.

She shook her head. ‚ÄúFull everywhere. Or too expensive for just one night.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything just waited. Finally, she exhaled. ‚ÄúYour offer‚Ä¶ does it still stand?‚Äù

A short nod from me. ‚ÄúCome on. It‚Äôs late.‚Äù

The ride to my place was quiet , tea stalls still lit, auto stands with lone drivers waiting for a last fare. Halfway there, she started talking about her interview, about how much was riding on it. I listened.

At my apartment, I showed her the spare room.

‚ÄúThis is yours. Bathroom‚Äôs just opposite. I will be in the other room if you need anything.‚Äù

She stood in the doorway, her hand resting on the frame.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do this for a stranger,‚Äù she said.

I shrugged.

Her eyes lingered on mine for a beat too long before she closed the door gently.

A soft knock at my door came later the kind that sounded unsure if it wanted an answer. I set my phone aside and opened it.

She stood there barefoot, hair loose now, falling over her shoulders. The travel pillow and jacket were gone just a plain T-shirt and shorts that made her look younger, softer.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù

I stepped aside. ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

She crossed the room slowly, glancing at the books on my desk, the half-open curtains letting in a slice of moonlight. She sat on the edge of my bed.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the interview,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúToo much in my head.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go fine,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve prepared.‚Äù

She looked at me then .......really looked and the something between us shifted.

‚ÄúYou make it sound easy,‚Äù she said softly.

‚ÄúI believe it.‚Äù

Our hands found each other without planning it. My thumb traced slow circles over hers.

‚ÄúDo you mind if I‚Ä¶ just stay here for a while?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúStay as long as you want.‚Äù

She shifted closer, our shoulders brushing. My hand rested lightly on her knee not pushing, just there. She didn‚Äôt move away.

Her eyes flicked to my mouth, and before I could think, mine were on hers. The kiss was slow, almost cautious but once her lips parted, it deepened, her hands sliding around my waist.

My mouth moved to her jaw, then the curve of her neck. She exhaled sharply, her nails grazing my back.

I eased her back onto the bed, the moonlight framing her face. My palm slid under her shirt, fingers tracing the warm skin of her waist. She arched slightly, a quiet sound escaping her throat.

‚ÄúTell me to stop,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù

The night unfolded in unhurried rhythm ‚Äî soft gasps, tangled sheets, whispered reassurances. It wasn‚Äôt rushed; it was as if both of us wanted to stretch every second until dawn.

Her skin was warm beneath my fingertips, silky and soft. Every inch of her seemed to pulse with life from the curve of her neck to her breasts pressed beneath my hands.

Our lips met again in a slow, smoldering kiss that deepened with each second. Her breath was sweet and heady, mixing with the faint scent of jasmine that clung to her hair. I traced the line of her jaw with my tongue, savoring the tremble beneath my lips.

Her hands tangled in my hair, pulling me closer, and I responded by letting my fingers explore the smooth planes of her back, dipping beneath her T-shirt to cup the warmth of her skin. She shivered under my touch, a low moan escaping her throat a sound that sent an electric current straight through me.

My hands moved down to the curve of her waist, fingers dancing lightly as I slowly lifted her shirt over her head. Her hair spilled like a dark waterfall around her face and shoulders, her skin glowing under the soft light. I kissed the hollow of her throat, trailing down to her collarbone, tasting every inch as her breath hitched beneath me.

I slipped my hands beneath her bra straps, unclasping it with slow, deliberate care. The fabric fell away, revealing the full, gentle curve of her breasts. I took one into my mouth, feeling her nipple harden against my tongue. Her hands clutched my shoulders, nails digging in lightly as a delicious shiver ran through her.

She pulled me back to her lips, kisses deep and hungry, her body arching into mine as I went lower, down her stomach, stooping to let my fingers tease the waistband of her shorts.

When I slid my hand inside, the heat was immediate, her skin soft . She gasped, pressing her hips up against my palm, inviting more. My fingers moved slowly, exploring ,every sigh and tremble pushing me deeper into her.

Her breath quickened, shallow and ragged as I kissed my way back up, finding her mouth again . We moved together, lips and hands tracing the paths of a thousand silent promises.

She rolled me onto my back. Her skin was warm beneath my hands, and I felt every muscle tighten and release as she moved against me, that was both gentle and intense.

Our bodies were in perfect rhythm, every touch releasing sparks that raced through us . The sound of her breath, soft moans, and she whispered my name filled the room .

When she came, it was fierce, beautiful, and raw. I followed, as we collapsed into each other, spent and satisfied.

we lay tangled in the half-light, the sound of the rain outside steady and calm. Neither of us spoke. There was no need.

The first pale light of morning seeped through the curtains, casting shadows across the sheets and warm skin.

She was lying next to me, head resting on my chest, fingers tracing lazy patterns over my ribs. Her hair spilled against my skin, and her breath came slow and peaceful .

I brushed a stray lock from her face, watching as her eyelashes fluttered open. Her eyes met mine heavy with sleep, still deep with the memory of the night .

A small, sleepy smile curved her lips.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I replied softly, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

We stayed like that, wrapped in the glow of morning ,we found in each other.

Outside, the city was waking up, but here, in this little room far from everything, time seemed to slow down just for us.

She shifted, snuggling closer, and I felt the steady rise and fall of her breath against my chest.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said after a moment, voice soft and sincere.

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor being here. For everything.‚Äù

I smiled,

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to thank me.‚Äù

Later that day, as she gathered her things to leave, I walked her to the door.

She hesitated, fingers lingering on the handle.

‚ÄúNo more delays, no more last-minute plans.‚Äù

I nodded, a slow smile spreading across my face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt say more . Just a quiet understanding.

As the door closed behind her, I felt something shift inside , the kind of feeling that tells you some meetings aren‚Äôt accidents.

Some models offer replaceable filters, while others feature self-cleaning functions.

Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva is one of the few who isn‚Äôt budging.

The left-wing South American president has taken a forceful response to the 50 percent tariffs Trump announced in July, last week calling on India, China and other emerging economies to unite against the U.S. levies. Lula, as Brazil‚Äôs president is known, called the tariffs ‚Äúunacceptable blackmail‚Äù and filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization, after Trump tied the levies in part to the prosecution of former Brazilian president and far-right Trump acolyte Jair Bolsonaro.

Unlike countries that have caved to Trump‚Äôs demands on digital services taxes or defense spending, Trump has tied tariffs so large they are effectively sanctions to an issue Lula‚Äôs government has made clear it won‚Äôt negotiate on. 

While Trump‚Äôs frustration with the group of emerging economies known as BRICS, and chatter that it might move away from the dollar, contributed to his decision to slap the 50 percent tariffs on Brazil, the move appears to be only bolstering the alliance.

An administration official acknowledged that the situation with Brazil is at a standstill, saying that the U.S. isn‚Äôt willing to open talks unless the issues the president has raised in his executive order ‚Äî including the prosecution of Bolsonaro and Trump‚Äôs complaint that the country‚Äôs regulation of social media platforms is censoring free speech ‚Äî are on the table.

Brazilian officials say leniency for Bolsonaro is a nonstarter, but Lula would negotiate on other issues important to both countries, including critical minerals and big tech. The government is hopeful that a U.S. investigation into Brazil‚Äôs trade practices, a slightly more technical and wonky process that was set in motion alongside the new tariffs, may be a forum through which to make some progress.

Experts in U.S.-Brazil relations say there‚Äôs a key reason Lula has been able to stand up to Trump in a way that other world leaders haven‚Äôt: While the U.S. is Brazil‚Äôs second-largest trading partner, the latter only exports about 10 percent of its goods to the U.S. ‚Äî about a third of what it sells to China. That means it‚Äôs far less economically dependent on the U.S. market than the European Union, Japan or India, which export closer to 20 percent of their goods to the U.S. And, unlike other countries that the U.S. has slapped with tariffs, Brazil actually has a trade surplus with the United States, meaning that prior to the Bolsonaro-related levies it was only facing a baseline 10 percent tariff.

Meanwhile, about 45 percent of Brazilian goods ‚Äî including hundreds in key industries like orange juice, pulp and oil ‚Äî have secured exemptions allowing them to pay the lower baseline tariff rate. That has also helped blunt the impact of the tariffs on Brazil‚Äôs economy, even as other key sectors like coffee and beef remain subject to the higher rate.",11,1754997665.0,neoliberal,6,0.92,False
1mo5ytn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1mo5ytn/can_magegee_ts91_gaming_keyboard_match/,Can MageGee TS91 Gaming Keyboard Match Expectations? Honest Review of Features and Performance,"Testing out the MageGee TS91 Mini 60% Gaming Keyboard has been quite the experience, and I‚Äôve got a lot to share. As someone who spends hours gaming, typing, or working on a cluttered desk, I was intrigued when I first came across this ultra-compact keyboard. It boasts a solid rating of 4.3 from over 2,300 customer reviews, which already set high expectations. Let me walk you through the aspects of this keyboard that stood out and those that were less satisfying. While I genuinely appreciate many features, there are a few nuances worth noting for those considering this purchase.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

The compact design on this 60% keyboard makes it perfect for anyone living in a world of minimal desk space. Right off the bat, I loved how sleek it looked sitting on my desk amidst all my gadgets. The white chassis against the vivid, adjustable RGB backlighting creates a clean yet vibrant aesthetic. It‚Äôs so mesmerizing that even my younger cousin, who isn‚Äôt a gamer, wanted one just because it ‚Äúlooks cool.‚Äù The lack of a numpad is not a dealbreaker for me, as I rarely use it; however, if you‚Äôre a numbers person, this might be something to think about.

**Good Aspects**

- The RGB lighting was a winner for me. It offers multiple colors and lighting modes, including both breathing and static options.
- Extremely lightweight at just 1.06 pounds, it makes on-the-go transitions seamless. 
- The ergonomic key height has been thoughtfully designed, which means I could pull off long gaming sessions without my wrists crying for help.
- It‚Äôs compact enough to leave more desk space for my mouse movements during intense gaming.
  
Check [MageGee TS91] price on Amazon.

**Performance and Usability**

Out of the box, this keyboard is plug-and-play, which means no additional software is needed to get started. Typing on it feels almost mechanical, even though it‚Äôs technically a membrane keyboard. MageGee managed to mimic a mechanical feel astoundingly well. Coming from someone who has spent years typing on clacky blue switches, I found this little guy surprisingly satisfying to smash keys during a heated match of Valorant.

The long play sessions often involved drinking coffee or energy drinks, and accidents did happen. Thankfully, the waterproof circuit board with IPX4 certification gave me peace of mind. However, while the circuit board remains safe from spills, the same can‚Äôt be said for the keyboard‚Äôs ports, so you‚Äôll still want to be careful around liquids.

**Key Benefits**

- The mechanical-like typing feel hits a sweet spot between membrane and full mechanical boards.
- It handled accidental spills during an all-night League session with zero functional hiccups.
- Adjusting the backlight brightness and breathing speed took no time at all, perfect for mood-based gaming sessions.

**Negatives to Watch For**

Unfortunately, nothing is perfect, and the MageGee TS91 has a few quirks.

- Customization for the RGB lighting is limited compared to more advanced keyboards.
- It doesn‚Äôt feature dedicated media keys, which would‚Äôve been a nice touch for multitasking.
- The lack of onboard memory means you can‚Äôt save lighting profiles for specific games or use cases.

**Competitive Options**

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt compare this with other budget-friendly compact gaming keyboards on the market. Take the Anne Pro 2, for instance‚Äîit offers wireless functionality and slightly more RGB customization. However, it‚Äôs priced significantly higher. Another contender, the RK61, offers hot-swappable switches, making it appealing for gamers who like to tinker, but it lacks the ease-of-use simplicity MageGee brings straight out of the box.

Where MageGee pulls ahead is in its affordability and no-frills approach. It‚Äôs like a reliable sidekick: it doesn‚Äôt do everything, but what it does, it does well.

**Cost Efficiency**

Buying gaming peripherals can often feel overwhelming because there are just so many options scattered across such a wide price range. From my perspective, MageGee‚Äôs TS91 strikes an excellent balance between price and performance. For those looking for a keyboard that offers a mechanical-like experience, stunning backlighting, and compact ergonomics without going overboard on cost, this is a solid choice.

**A 26-year-old man once came to me and said:**

‚ÄúSir, I lose over **100 hairs a day**. I‚Äôve tried every product‚Äîshampoos, serums, oils‚Äîbut nothing has helped. I‚Äôm going bald!‚Äù

Over time, he realized a **crucial truth**:  
**No product‚Äîno matter how expensive‚Äîcan save your hair if your lifestyle is unhealthy.**

üö® **The Science Behind Hair Loss**  
As per the Hair expert **Dr Sanjay Pancholi MD (Skin)**

üß¨ **90%** of hair fall and baldness is due to **genetic and hormonal factors**.  
However, there are **5 lifestyle habits** that are **completely in your control**‚Äîand they can **slow hair loss**, **improve hair density**, and even **support regrowth**.

# 1. Prioritize Deep, Restful Sleep

**Why sleep matters:**

* During **deep sleep**, your body releases **growth hormones** that repair and stimulate hair follicles.
* **Poor sleep** = less hormone release + more **cortisol** (stress hormone) = **more hair fall**.

**Study Insight:**  
üìä **57%** of people with poor sleep had **significant hair thinning**.

**Tips for better sleep:**

* **Limit screen time** before bed *(at least 1 hour)*
* **Avoid heavy dinners**
* **Skip overstimulating activities** (e.g. late-night TV)
* Aim for **8‚Äì9 hours** of restful sleep

# 2. Eat for Your Hair (Protein and Minerals)

Hair is made of **keratin**‚Äîa protein. Without enough protein, hair becomes **weak and dry**.

**Nutrients that support hair:**

* **Protein:** Paneer, milk, yogurt, eggs, lentils, sprouts
* **Iron & Zinc:** Spinach, chickpeas, cashews, pumpkin seeds
* **Vitamin B Complex:** Bananas, coriander, eggs, nuts & seeds

**Avoid:**

* **Junk food, cold drinks, excess tea/coffee**
* These **interfere with nutrient absorption** and **disturb hormones** like **DHT & estrogen**, triggering hair fall.

# 3. Exercise Daily for Blood Flow & Hormonal Balance

**Why it works:**

* Exercise **improves scalp blood circulation**, ensuring hair follicles get **oxygen and nutrients**.
* **Reduces cortisol**, increases **endorphins** = **less stress, more growth**

**What to do:**

* **Cardio:** Improves blood flow
* **Yoga:** Reduces stress
* **Strength training:** Balances hormones

üí° Just **30 minutes/day** can improve hair quality.

**Avoid:** Creatine, steroid cycles & **extreme gym routines**‚Äîthey can **worsen hormonal imbalance** and **accelerate baldness**.

# 4. Protect Your Mental Peace

**Chronic stress = chronic hair loss**

* **Stress raises cortisol** and lowers **serotonin**, which **damages hair follicles**.
* Triggers the **telogen (shedding) phase**, leading to **100‚Äì300 hairs** falling per day.

**Solutions:**

* **Laugh more, smile often**
* **Practice yoga, meditation, deep breathing**
* **Spend time in nature**
* **Increase happy hormones**: serotonin, oxytocin, melatonin

# 5. Eliminate the Toxic Trio

‚ò†Ô∏è **The Toxic Trio:**

1. **Pollution**
2. **Alcohol**
3. **Smoking**

**What they do:**

* **Increase free radicals** ‚Üí damage hair cells
* **Narrow blood vessels** ‚Üí less oxygen to hair roots
* **Disrupt DHT balance** ‚Üí hair thinning & premature greying

**Long-term exposure** = **rapid hair loss** \+ visible baldness.

# Final Thoughts

**Stop chasing external products** and **start fixing your internal habits**.  
Healthy hair begins with a **healthy lifestyle**.

**Summary of the 5 Habits:**

1. **Sleep** 8‚Äì9 hours deeply
2. **Eat** a clean, nutrient-rich diet
3. **Exercise** daily for blood flow
4. **Reduce stress** with mindfulness
5. **Avoid** pollution, smoking & alcohol

‚úÖ These five habits are **FREE, SIMPLE, and LIFE-CHANGING**.  
Take care of your **body**, your **mind**, and your **hair will follow**.

1mo5vdr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mo5vdr,"Life of coffee farmers in a Thai forest village of Pa Miang, Lampang. A different travel experience.","Hi all :D I recently started my journey of travelling around Thailand to film how the locals in different regions and occupations live. Last May, I was wandering around Lampang downtown and found a farmer who drove from a forest village to sell coffee drinks and beans at a weekend market. I introduced myself and had a chat with him. He agreed to take me to the village and allowed me to film the life of his family.

On 2 June 2025, I travelled to Pa Miang, a small village in Lampang, which isn‚Äôt that far from Mae Kampong, but it‚Äôs much more peaceful. A few days afterwards, I woke up around 5 AM and went to his house. His mom was preparing breakfast. She cut banana leaves and used them to cook khai pam (spiced grilled eggs) on a charcoal stove. Around 6:30 AM, his sister went to pick green chillis and chayote leaves, all from the family‚Äôs garden. After breakfast, the family headed to the forest to plant more coffee trees.

At first, I thought Komsan, the 38-year-old plantation owner who brought me to Pa Miang, was born with money, but he later told me that, like the other villagers, he grew up poor. In the past, most if not all households in Pa Miang grew assam tea, aka Miang in the local dialect, and fermented it in bulk before selling it to merchants as a means to earn their income. During the dry season (January-April), the locals went to work as construction workers in cities. Since there was no concrete road or a public bus route, they could only walk. Only comparatively richer families were able to afford a horse or even a car that could travel on dirt.¬†

Growing up poor, Komsan became a child monk so that he could receive an education. During high school, he left the temple, came to Lampang downtown, attended school in the morning & afternoon, and worked at restaurants in the evening. During weekends, he rode a motorbike back home to help his family produce fermented Miang.¬†

Around the same period, a concrete road and phone networks reached Pa Miang, and an NGO introduced coffee to the locals. Komsan‚Äôs mother was the first in the family to plant coffee. One day, when Komsan was 19 (around 2006), his mom was supposed to give him some cash before he returned to Lampang downtown, but she didn‚Äôt have it. Instead, she gave him 9 kilograms of coffee beans and asked him to sell them to a local merchant. He did, and he received 1000 Thai Baht! (Around 30 USD). He was so happy that he began to dream of transforming the family‚Äôs Miang plantation into a vast coffee plantation, which could bring the family out of poverty. After graduation, he worked hard to make his vision a reality. He was in the right place at the right time. For the past 19 years, there have been more cafes with commercial and specialty coffee drinks around Thailand. The demand for coffee beans has grown. Nowadays, he owns over 10,000 coffee trees and a brand of coffee beans, selling the beans directly to cafes and individual consumers.¬†

Based on my observation, the overall well-being of other households in Pa Miang has also improved. One of Komsan‚Äôs cousins produces tea as a beverage and operates half-day trips to her plantation and a roasting facility. A lot of locals own guesthouses, homestays, cafes, and eateries. Komsan also welcomes travellers to visit his coffee plantation.

What have I learned from Komsan‚Äôs family? A lot! It was eye-opening to learn how local Thais live in a remote village. Back in high school, some discussion cases in economics class involved some big MNCs exploiting the farmers in rural regions by buying the produce at cheap prices. I‚Äôm happy to see Komsan‚Äôs family develop a brand and sell roasted beans on their own. Plus, it was fun to see a civet‚Äôs excrement in the forest!

I‚Äôm aware that this post may look like self-promotional content or a PR article for Zhan Coffee. I‚Äôm not gonna add any links to my video or any social media channels here so that this post won‚Äôt violate any sub rules. I hope to share the locals‚Äô lives in Thailand with international travellers and, if possible, inspire more of them to travel to niche villages and support local businesses. If this post has some readers, I might share more stories in this sub soon :D¬†

Notes: 

1. I don‚Äôt earn any commission from Zhan Coffee. It's a local brand, and I'm just here to share my travel story.

2. Komsan has allowed me to share his story on the internet.

3. A reminder from me: try to go there during the winter. It's not that safe when the road is wet during the rainy season. Even worse when the rain falls while you're driving uphill.",6,1754997334.0,ThailandTourism,0,0.88,False

# After a house fire, there‚Äôs a smell you carry long after the flames are out. You can‚Äôt scrub it away. People catch it before you do. That‚Äôs what bias feels like after you‚Äôve walked through darkness and fire. You step into daylight thinking you‚Äôre new. They smell the smoke.

Once it‚Äôs in your file, the math changes. One mistake confirms suspicion. Ten thousand clean days just get you back to zero. Joining a program doesn‚Äôt erase it. AA, therapy, church ‚Äî whatever banner you stand under ‚Äî the outside world reads them as proof you‚Äôre still in repair.

People who‚Äôve never burned down to the studs get judged in the moment. You don‚Äôt. Your now is cross-referenced with your then every time you open your mouth. It‚Äôs not fair ‚Äî it‚Äôs human. We remember the threat better than the safety. The probation this creates has no end date.

AA can help you live in that reality, but it can‚Äôt change the way others carry your past. Sometimes it sharpens their lens. They hear ‚ÄúAA‚Äù and think ‚Äústill needs saving.‚Äù They assume the program is the leash. And maybe it is. But a leash is not a life.

The suspicion isn‚Äôt just theirs ‚Äî you carry it too. Some nights you interrogate yourself: *Am I trustworthy? Where‚Äôs the edge? How close am I to it?* AA‚Äôs language of powerlessness works for some. Others need more than surrender ‚Äî they need proof they can stand without leaning on a wall.

Trauma doesn‚Äôt respect program boundaries. Your amygdala still remembers the smoke. Dopamine still remembers the path to chaos. The prefrontal cortex still shows the grooves of years in survival mode. AA can help you live with those maps, but it can‚Äôt redraw them. That takes other tools: therapy, meditation, medication, service work, quiet routines. Recovery is an ecosystem. AA is one instrument in the orchestra, not the whole symphony.

Proof isn‚Äôt cinematic. It‚Äôs microscopic: leaving before the second drink, returning the call you promised, meeting the deadline without chaos. AA can hold you accountable for some of those moments, but it can‚Äôt see all of them. The real ledger is kept in the hours between the meetings.

There‚Äôs a basement with metal chairs and bad coffee where God shows up in the raw truth of strangers. This is where AA is strongest. But even here, the walls can feel close. The steps are a map, but not the terrain. Outside, the terrain demands other maps: how to talk to your boss without shame, how to walk past the trigger without prayer, how to stay sober in places no one‚Äôs reciting the Serenity Prayer.

The grocery store is another proving ground. The scanner fails, the machine barks *unexpected item*. Before, you‚Äôd slam it. Now you breathe. You smile at the clerk. AA can teach the posture. You practice it everywhere else.

Early on, you want universal trust. Later, you learn to love the small, steel circle. Some in it will be AA people. Some will never set foot in a meeting. What matters is they hold both truths: you can ruin and you can repair. And they know the line between those is thin for everyone ‚Äî yours is just better lit.

Courts, clinics, companies ‚Äî they run the same primitive math. Saying you‚Äôre ‚Äúin a program‚Äù might help in one room and hurt in another. They‚Äôre not measuring the program; they‚Äôre measuring liability. The trick is fluency ‚Äî knowing when to lead with AA and when to let your actions speak without it.

People will still ask for guarantees you can‚Äôt give ‚Äî the promise that nothing will ever break again. AA is a harbor. Harbors are essential. But the ocean is still out there, and you have to sail. You need balance that works in all waters, not just one.

Recovery isn‚Äôt slogans and anniversaries. It‚Äôs putting the cart back. Answering the email. Saying no when you could say yes. AA can teach the posture. The world teaches the rest.

Can anyone ever trust you again? Sometimes. Sometimes not. And sometimes the question is wrong. The real one is: *Can you trust yourself without leaning so hard on one system you can‚Äôt stand without it?*

Late train. Summer rain. A woman in a yellow dress is crying quietly. You hand her a napkin. No speeches. No rescue fantasy. The train comes. You both get on. No new damage done. AA didn‚Äôt teach you that. Life did.

When they ask for guarantees, you say: ‚ÄúWatch long enough and you‚Äôll know. If you can‚Äôt watch that long, you were never going to anyway.‚Äù AA can give you a meeting to say that in. But you have to live it in the open air.",1,1754996982.0,recoverywithoutAA,0,1.0,False

Just one more month. You'll see that I'm the same person i always was with you. 

I've bottled in these feelings. I can handle them. It'll be worth it. These feelings are my penance. But I can't hold them anymore. It's toxic to me. My heads foggy, stuck in the clouds. I feel numb. It hurts inside too much at night. I can't sleep. 

You told me you're focusing on what's healthy for you. And I love that. I want you to be happy more than anything. And what you told me was that you feel very good and healthy when you spend less time on your phone. Your phone. I only exist on your phone. I can't swing by after work and bring you coffee or food or jeni's. That's not reality. So to be healthy if to be free of your phone which therefore means to be free of me.  So why I am here?

Quite long right? but dumating na kami sa point na kung saan niloko niya ako. He cheated because of ""yun nalang yung reason niya para makawala sa relationship namin"" and other reason is hindi daw ako nagbabago, like pagiging masungit and such. Yan ang mga reasons niya bakit niya ako niloko. 

3rd year namin nag break kami ng 1 week because of micro cheating at pamamahiya niya sakin in public. Bumalik para bawiin lahat, lahat ng pagkukulang at kasalanan but then napansin niya nagbago ako for a week pero bumabalik daw ugali ko na hindi ko maintindihan ano ba talaga dapat baguhin dahil di siya open. He stalked a lot of girls, followed of girls at naging Avon Brochure na yung IG niya. 

Dumating ang ika-apat na taon, dun na siya nag paalam gabi ng magkasama kami not knowing na kinabukasan malalaman ko lahat na may conversation na sila sa ig at i message na hindi alam ng babae na break na talaga kami at nakita ako sa fb posts niya na andun pa rin. The girl confronted me at dun na siya nagsimula na gawin yun ng paulit ulit kahit na inaayos namin yung relasyon hanggat kaya pa. After that, mga nakakasawang away at arguments lang hanggang sa nag isang buwan, naibalita sakin ng mga ka work niya na may kdate na siya na dinala sa workplace niya (coffee shop) which is madalas din naming tambayan. Mind you kakampi ako ng mga ka work niya and not tolerating him kasi super weird na weird sila sa ex ko. 

Ang di ko lang maintindihan, bakit ganun ako kabilis palitan? hindi ba pwedeng paabutin muna niya ng more than 6 mons, ayusin muna ang sarili, trabaho at buhay kesa unahin lumandi? I cant understand. Naaawa ako sa mga bagong mabibiktima niya saying na hindi niya uulitin ang lahat ng abusive shit sa ibang babae. So ano? sakin niya lang gagawin kasi mas deserve ko maramdaman yung pananakit ng physical, paninigaw at cheating issue niya? I build him for 4 yrs tapos ganun ganun lang? asan ang respect? Sobra ako nasasaktan na meron siyang iba kasi mas naaalala ko kung paano siya magmahal in agood way kesa dun sa mga red flags niya. di kami makapag cut ng communication since inuunti unti pa bayaran ang utang niya bukod dun super close din ako sa pamilya niya at tinuring akong pamilya. 

Idk, bakit ganun ang mga lalaki? insecure? seeking for other's validation since di ko raw siya vinalidate sa loob ng four years? imposible e.

All the symptoms, both physical and mental. I couldn't stay alone at home, I was feeling like I was mourning someone, that type of sadness I never felt in my life. I was crying inconsolably for hours! Made my husband stay home from work to be with me. Went to the emergency psychiatrist and he disagnosed me with PMDD, gave me Tavor and Quetiapine, with which I managed to be alone and quiet my emotions. 

Now, its my 2nd day of period and I no longer have intrusive thoughts and feelings of complete despair, but I'm still waiting to get back the feeling of enjoyment in things though :((((

In your experience, when does that come back after your 1st cycle day? Its been just one cycle of this and I already miss my ""me time"", gaming, just sipping coffee and all those ordinary things. ü•∫

Also, should I go with SSRI half a month, or try a hormonal pill?

I am 33, I had ovarian cysts since my 20s, acne, greasy hair and skin, and most recently breast cysts... It seems my hormones are in a disbalance since forever, or at least I'm sensitive to all their changes during the month.

1mo5hf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mo5hf1/pc_wont_boot_after_furmark_stress_testing/,PC won't boot after FurMark stress testing,"Hi,

I recently wanted to give an old family PC a small upgrade to extend its lifespan for everyday internet use and some older games when the kids visit their grandma. The PC originally had a Phenom II X3 720BE, a Radeon 5850, and 4GB DDR3 RAM.

I bought on OLX a Radeon RX590, a Phenom II X6 1090T, and 16GB of RAM. I swapped the parts ‚Äî but surprise, it wouldn‚Äôt start. No boot menu, nothing. I left the PC for a few hours because I had errands to run, and when I got back I put the old CPU back in, but oddly enough it still wouldn‚Äôt power on.

I ruled out the GPU because when swapping components I had first tested it with just the new GPU installed, and it worked (although the boot screen showed artifacts instead of the Gigabyte logo, if I remember correctly). Since it was already late, I decided to put the PC back together and tried the 1090T again ‚Äî and suddenly it booted! It shut down the first time, but after that, it ran fine.

Over the next few days, when I had some free time, I did a fresh Windows install and started tinkering with it a bit. Since I only have a 500W PSU inside, I thought it would be a good idea to do a slight undervolt on the components. I reduced the CPU voltage by 0.025V and ran Prime95 for a few minutes (I know, not long) without major issues.

On the GPU, I tested many different voltages, increasing them slightly whenever FurMark detected artifacts until I found what seemed like a stable level (around 0.025V‚Äì0.030V lower than stock). I also set a much more aggressive fan curve for the GPU so that at 75¬∞C the fans would already be running at 100%. Then I ran FurMark again and went to make coffee.

When I came back, there was no signal to the monitor ‚Äî and since then, the PC shows absolutely nothing when I turn it on. What‚Äôs interesting is that I can turn the PC on with the power button, but to turn it off I have to switch off the PSU.

At first, I suspected the graphics card, but swapping in the old Radeon 5850 gave the same result. Swapping the CPU back to the X3 720 ‚Üí same. Using only one stick of RAM ‚Üí same. Then I started to suspect the PSU, since it‚Äôs over 15 years old, but I just measured the voltages with a multimeter on the 8-pin GPU, 8-pin CPU, and 24-pin ATX connectors, and they seem to match the reference values (although I didn‚Äôt test every single pin individually ‚Äî I‚Äôm a beginner, so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs necessary).

I also checked the power draw with a watt meter, and it‚Äôs only around 36W, which is clearly way too low.

In summary, I‚Äôm wondering if these symptoms ring any bells for those more experienced, and whether there‚Äôs any more diagnostics I could try myself before I give up on this old hardware and build a new system. I currently have some free time and would gladly try more things ‚Äî I‚Äôm open to your suggestions.

P.S. Right after the PC died, I didn‚Äôt smell any burnt components.

Best regards,

# Dispatch #5 in the ongoing BestGuessistan Series ‚Äî insider intel from Officialdom. Loose lips sink ships... or just start interesting rumors. Your call. No Wrong Answers.



**This is the leak of the leak.**  
The one that slipped out after the¬†*first*¬†one made headlines. The tote bag you weren‚Äôt supposed to see, with the meeting notes you¬†*definitely*¬†weren‚Äôt supposed to read. If LinkedIn was the press conference, this is the backroom briefing with more coffee stains, crossed-out lines, and off-the-record commentary.

In BestGuessistan, secrets don‚Äôt just leak ‚Äî they flood, trickle, and occasionally burst like a badly sealed coffee thermos. Every memo, summit, and strategy somehow escapes before the ink‚Äôs even dry.

Blame it on rogue aides, baristas with a flair for drama, or those ever-listening AI recorders that might secretly be running their own ministry. Whatever it is, confidentiality here is about as reliable as a paper umbrella in a hurricane.

This week‚Äôs ‚ÄúVision Board vs. Gantt Chart‚Äù summit, hosted by the Department of Operational Myth-Making under the Ministry of Plausible Narratives, was supposed to marry lofty inspiration with cold, hard execution. Instead, it became a surreal mash-up of moon phases, spreadsheets, and pocket wrenches that suspiciously perform miracles.

**Department Mission:**  
‚ÄúTo turn every brilliant idea into a real-world thing without killing the magic ‚Äî all while juggling quarterly KPIs, shifting OKRs, and maintaining maximum plausible deniability.‚Äù

**Meet the Cast:**

* **Lauren**, Minister of Purposeful Vision & Aligned Action, who named herself after a three-day silent retreat filled with cedar-scented mission statements and an Enlightened but Efficient playlist ‚Äî with a musical theater interlude, naturally.
* **Jaime**, Minister of Manufacturing What We Message & Messaging What We Manufacture, whose title was won fair and square in a Ministry hackathon aimed at cramming the most nouns into a job title without Legal sending a strongly worded letter.

**Summit Highlights:**

* Align the ‚ÄúNorth Star‚Äù with the ‚ÄúAssembly Line‚Äù ‚Äî literal constellations may have been involved.
* Debate if inspiration rides shotgun or if implementation drives. Spoiler: the motorbike metaphor got a little dusty.
* Settle the glitter pen vs. torque wrench procurement war.

Lauren led a 12-minute guided meditation on ‚Äúconnecting with our inner why,‚Äù while Jaime countered with load-balancing spreadsheets, safety goggles, and that miracle-working pocket wrench. Production paused for three hours when someone took ‚Äúvision alignment‚Äù literally and tried rotating the Assembly Line 17 degrees toward Orion‚Äôs Belt.

**The Aftermath:**

* Vision promised to keep its feet on the factory floor ‚Äî at least quarterly.
* Execution agreed to occasionally nod thoughtfully at metaphors.
* The espresso machine now syncs with lunar cycles and delivery deadlines.

**Leak-Specific To-Dos:**

* Investigate oat milk demands from the espresso calibration crew ‚Äî prime suspects or cleverly disguised decoys?
* Review tote bag printing policies. If it‚Äôs on a tote bag, did it ever really stay secret?
* Audit AI recorder permissions ‚Äî are we slaves to the machines or just badly managed?
* Launch a ‚Äúplausible deniability‚Äù task force specializing in metaphor laundering and creative storytelling.

**What‚Äôs Next?**  
Whispers of a brewing junta led by the Chief Alchemist of Audience Enchantment & Brand Legerdemain promise a spectacle of chaos and charisma. Meanwhile, BestGuessistan welcomes fresh blood ‚Äî including a Minister of Emotional Finance and Value, set to shake up how currency flows through this curious bureaucracy.

The Ministries invite your own ‚ÄúVision vs. Version Control‚Äù tales ‚Äî glitter pens and torque wrenches encouraged.

For context I am 37 female and I am looking to improve my financial situation. I have never been particularly great at finances, I struggle with certain mental health conditions and can be quite impulsive. I am aware this isn't an excuse, just context. I have spent the last year and a half trying to pay off debts that accrued when I was younger. My goals are to pay off remaining debts and build some savings. I would like to do this as quickly as possible.

Here is all the information that you might need, I am happy to provide further if needed!

\_\_\*\*INCOME\*\*\_\_

Yearly salary: ¬£38,746

Monthly pay pre-deductions: ¬£3229

Monthly net take-home after deductions: ¬£2126

\*\*Breakdown of deductions:\*\*

Pension: ¬£161

Extra holiday: ¬£60

Student loan: ¬£75

Tax & NI: ¬£555

\-------------------------------------------

\_\_\*\* MONTHLY OUTGOINGS\*\*\_\_

Rent: ¬£600

Entertainment subscriptions: ¬£72

Credit repayments: ¬£277

Travel costs: ¬£250

Social & misc: ¬£355

Total outgoings: ¬£1697

\*\*For context:\*\*

\- Entertainment subs = streaming services (Netflix, spotify etc) and game subscriptions. These are my main hobbies, I don't really go out much.

\- Credit repayments = this doesn't count the ¬£256 salary finance as that is deducted directly from my salary before I get paid. This was a ¬£10,000 loan I took to purchase a new car.

\- Travel = I have to commute 3 times a week for work, it's a 40 mile round trip. This factors in fuel costs, parking or train costs - it works out the same cost on average to drive vs taking the train.

\- Social & misc = this includes the gym, clothing, toiletries, cat food, coffee and lunch at work and social activities.

\-------------------------------------------

\_\_\*\*CREDIT REPAYMENTS\*\*\_\_

Santander credit card: monthly repayment - ¬£70 | amount remaining: ¬£640

Salary finance: monthly repayment - ¬£256 | amount remaining: ¬£3337

Lendable: monthly repayment - ¬£97 | amount remaining: ¬£3215

Paypal credit: monthly repayment - ¬£106 | amount remaining: ¬£1423

Total owed: ¬£8616

\*\*Interest charges\*\*

\- Credit card: I'm not sure on the interest rate, but the monthly charge I pay is ¬£6 and I started paying above the minimum this year. The minimum amount is around ¬£15 and I pay ¬£70 (this month I did pay ¬£90).  
\- Salary finance: 19.9% yearly interest, I pay the amount they set to repay the loan over a 5 year term.  
\- Lendable: 11% yearly interest, I pay the amount they set to repay over a 3 year term.  
\- Paypal credit: 23.9% interest, I pay the amount they set to repay over a 3 (iirc) term.



\*\*For context:\*\*

\- Salary finance was a ¬£10,000 loan for a new car, I have 2 years left on this

\- Lendable was a ¬£3000 loan that I took out recently to pay off a ¬£2000 overdraft. The remaining ¬£1000 went towards my Santander credit card and a car repair bill

\- Paypal credit was used to purchase a new PC



\-------------------------------------------

\*\*SAVINGS\*\*

I currently have ¬£1000 in savings and would like suggestions on how to best use this.

\-------------------------------------------

I have recently opened a secondary bank account which I am paying ¬£300 allowance for my ""social & misc"" into - I am hoping this will help me keep better track of spending and force accountability. I do have a bad habit of spending money if I see I have it...I really want to try to take control of this and I am hoping this will help - I am open to any other suggestions on this too! I don't really do much socially and I am not particularly materialistic - most of my spare money goes on gaming or work lunch and coffees so I am trying to cut back in these areas.

Many thanks in advance :)

1mo5ee8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mo5ee8/cicada_bells_samuel_giest/,Cicada Bells - Samuel Giest,"Generally, an author's forward may be regarded as a bit pretentious, depending on the circumstances of the story. 

For a fictional story, it would be almost appropriate. ‚ÄúThank you to my daughter Cindy for keeping her imagination open‚Äù, ‚ÄúThank you to my wife for the countless cups of black coffee‚Äù.  Very James Patterson. For a non-fictional one, it might be a bit of a whining sheet, I think. 

‚ÄúOh, woe is me, the stress of collecting public information and formatting it into several hundred paragraphs has taken my sanity from me-‚Äù kind of thing. 

I haven't done so many of these, as my other collections of events and testimonies have spoken mostly for themselves depending on how much historical context I sneak in the introduction.

I do this because I love the mystery, the intrigue and the campfire-esque quality these accounts and journals exhibit. Whether or not I believe in them, it doesn't matter. There's just something I think should be heard in them, that's all.

This time, I thought maybe it'd be a nice piece to set the right tone for this particular account. 

My name is Sam, and my last name is Geist.  I worked for three years in the Ribbons County Library as an archivist and I never went to college.

I don't sleep a lot, but mostly because I think it's sort of fun. 

This story comes from a moldy old file box I found tucked away in a mop closet in the Ribbons County Public Library. 

I remember it was a late night when I'd caught myself digging through the piles of papers and manilla folder. Finally, after hauling it all down the smoke-stained hallway and into my office, I'd flipped through five or six papers before the box yielded a stale, yellow packet. 

As the text pressed into the front page indicated, I was looking at a report and affidavit from the Ribbons County Police Department.

It was barebones, just enough to get across that Mr. Thornhill had suffered from ‚ÄúHarassment‚Äù and ‚ÄúIntimidation‚Äù from somebody or, in hindsight, something on the night of October 30th of 1976.

Mr. Thornhill, joined by his wife and son, had only moved to a shabby little den a mile from town the day before. Apparently, it hadn't taken long for the town's stranger side to peek into their lives.

Nothing appeared to come of it initially, just a small report in the bottom of a file box. 

Curiosity must have gotten the better of me, as I couldn't help but ask around the sheriff's office come morning. It was purely a hunch, but it had been so long since I found the Poolhouse Journals and I was hungry for another spooky story.

I got an address from the ever-sweet Ms. Collins at the front counter and found myself driving to the burbs somewhere in the evening. I found the new Thornhill residence there, with a solemn old man greeting me at the door. 

Mr. Thornhill hadn't been who I imagined, being more bookish looking than the men I was accustomed to seeing around town. 

Not a hint of stubble on his face, a pair of pristine black glasses on the crook of his nose, and his snow-white hair combed to the side as if it had never left the sixties.

He had me at the table within five minutes, shooting off notes about his grandson and his batting average on the Wombats little league team that season. 

It seemed a shameful thing in retrospect to blindside him with the report. 

Mr. Thornhill clamped up as the question sprung from me, and I was afraid he'd shut down and throw me out. 

Maybe I hit the right note, but he didn't shut the door on me completely. Instead, he asked that I give him time to write. This was strange, as I'd never met a subject of my posts before, let alone been offered a written account from the horse's mouth. 

A week after, I received a call and excitedly came by a second time to pick up a hefty few pages from Mr Thornhill's own hand. 

That night, I read them until the sun came up.


I happen to live in the woods just a few miles west of the location talked about in the report and after reading the packet in it's entirety, I've never looked at those trees the same. 

Between the double-wide trailers and the outskirts of the burbs, when asphalt roads turn to dirt ones, I feel it there when the sun gets low. 

When it's dark, when the moon comes up over the tops of the pines, there's a tinge of hell there now. I'll always look twice when I see sewer drain, or even a simple office vent.

I can feel it every time I look there into the ink colored space between every branch, and this testimony is the reason that childhood fear of the night has crept back into my life. 

Here's to hoping that the years after poor Mr. Thornhill‚Äôs terrible weekend vanquished whatever set on him those nights in ‚Äò76.  

Hoping that maybe my uneasiness in those wooded hills is just a memory of a memory.

The following is Mr. Thornhill's own writing, his own account. Please, consider it carefully and with a hint of grace fit for an old, honest man. 


****


I think the best place to start would be the crash. 

We were fifteen miles out from Weinwick I think, it's hard to remember. What comes back to my mind was the road. God, the dirt and rocks kicking up and smacking the under-carriage kept the car constantly loud. 

The forest on either side was like two walls of green, no gap went over a foot without another huge pine growing behind the first. 

My wife sat in the passenger side of the grizzly old Chevy pick up while my son sat in the back behind me. 

Initially, it was supposed to have been a nice little drive on a local road to the new house. Something her mother had mentioned on the phone yesterday. She thought it'd be nice and Janice was in a big hurry to feel as local as possible, though I was in no hurry at all.


I mean, the boy started at the elementary school the next day and I still hadn't figured out what bus to get him on, she hadn't found a job, and I wouldn't be starting work at the firm in Portland for another four days. 

I was scared shitless that we were playing stupid with the entire thing and that this had all been a big mistake. Shit, I'm not too sure where I stand on it even now. 

But her mother had told her about the ‚Äúscenic little road‚Äù that cuts into town from just passed Eugene and she ‚Äúdidn't want to come in feeling like a tourist.‚Äù 

But I humored her, as I always do. She always smiles so much when I play into the cute little ideas she gets and I'm a sucker for it every time. 

That's who she married, an idiot.

Maybe the road wasn't so bad, maybe I'm just being a big Nancy about the whole thing. But it was loud before we found it. 

That's when I saw the taillights straight out down that road, staring back through our windshield like eyes in the dark.

The dust and dirt kicked up by our tires danced in the beam of our headlights as I slowed our thirty-five miles per hour to a ten. The vehicle didn't move, and the beam of the yellow light trickled down the rocks as we slowly crept forward.

That's when the rusted back bumper slunk out of the dark and the bed of the truck followed it, till the vague frame of the cab was just beyond visible. 

I'd stopped, and Janice had lightly punched my knee, kicking her head up and gesturing to the truck. 

 Keep in mind, I'd already been at my wits end ten miles back where we'd come, so I didn't take the assignment without what amounted to a few angry grunts. 

Needless to say, I hesitantly opened the door to the Chevy and heard her turn and distract our son who was excitedly stirring now that he noticed we'd stopped the drive. 

As she asked him for a game of Rock-Paper-scissors, I felt myself nervously re-tucking the waist of my shirt under the belt as I shut the door and took the first few steps toward the truck. 


The brush was buzzing with crickets as I neared the bed of the truck, and the sun had now completed it's descent back behind the horizon. 


I was startled sure, but not expecting any trouble in the small walk to the window of the truck, I picked up speed and reached the driver's side before stepping back. 

I saw the tree first, still standing strong with the lip of the hood curled and bent around its trunk like a piece of tinfoil.

I saw the front of the frame run mangled up to the windshield, which had burst into a thousand shards of speckled glass. 

I leaned in, my breath held in the back of my throat as I made out the outline of a figure in the front seat. The brim of his cap hung sideways against the steering wheel while the meat surrounding the head was clinging wetly to a huge stone. 

A man was inside, dead. 

His arms hung limp around the rock, his fingers were still tight and curled around the sides of it like they'd failed to pull it off of his chest. 

Bits of slimy red matter dripped down onto the collar of his denim jacket, turning the blue into a horrible dark purple. 

I saw that his shirt had been torn out, ribbons of shredded flannel lightly covered a large hole in his breast. The skin had been gutted and a circle of teeth marks took my mind to scary places, as did the strange yellow mucus oozing around the wound.


Maybe I'd felt sick, I don't remember. What I do though is gripping the handle of my car door tightly before immediately jumping in and letting out that baited breath. 


Janice turned to me like I'd asked her to find the TV remote, but must have gauged the situation better than I expected when she lightly ran an arm around the width of my shoulders. 

She asked what was wrong, and I told her that we needed the police as soon as possible. Maybe she thought I was joking, but when she let out a chuckle in disbelief I slammed my hand down on the wheel hard. 

We were getting the police as soon as we got to town, we were getting the hell out of dodge. 

She leaned back to her corner on the passenger side and told my son that everything was alright. 

He wasn't listening though. 

I peered at him through the side mirror and saw his face pressed against his window, fog growing where his mouth met the glass. 

All three of us sat there quiet while the engine purred, my wife shooting me a look before we heard him pipe up from the backseat. 

‚ÄúSlinky-man, mommy! Look, look! The slinky-man!‚Äù

Neither of us spoke, but we shared a consumed smirk before she reached back and clicked his seatbelt back into its slot. 

I started the car and bent the gas down till the debris on the road kicked up and pelted the bottom of the vehicle at a decibel unheard of before.

I do realize now, that that was the first sign of things to come.


I can't pull out all the specifics from under the fluorescent bulbs in that tiny police station, but I remember Sheriff Gerald and company being the kind of guys I'd only seen in spaghetti westerns. 

The Sheriff himself was shorter, but his arms were packed with the kind of muscle that you only see in a farmer or a prison inmate. I remember a scar running down the length of his neck and a handlebar mustache that could have fit perfectly on a hell‚Äôs angel. 

There were few words in-between my details from the crash, just a ‚ÄúYessir‚Äù and a ‚ÄúNo sir‚Äù and a ‚ÄúDown on Lynx Road?‚Äù 

They'd asked what the truck looked like, if I could describe the man's features at all. 

I told them they'd be hard pressed to do so themselves if they'd seen how Rock and Face had become one in the driver's seat of that beat up Pick-up truck. 

‚ÄúAny idea where the stone came from?‚Äù 

What the hell am I supposed to say? I have no idea. 

So we gave them what we could, and judging by the bags hung under Gerald's eyes, I don't think he was happy to have to run out to that boony-road and haul the vehicle back to town at a quarter to midnight. 

Who could blame him? 

‚ÄúYou coming by for the fishin‚Äô or are you on your way out to Portland?‚Äù

I explained that we were moving into a place in town, it was on Harrison trail. Gerald kind of scoffed, but not in a bad way. He just raised an eyebrow and finished writing down the information I'd given him. 

‚ÄúGonna be a lot of fun out there, fella. You were‚Ä¶?‚Äù 

I told him my name was Ferris, and asked what he meant. 

‚ÄúShoot, Ferris! You got yourself settled into a far little branch of town. It's a bit out there, might be the only house I can think of for a few miles in either direction.‚Äù 

A deputy spoke up from his place at the water cooler.

‚ÄúNah, the Clark castle is out a little further that way.‚Äù

The Sheriff brushed at his mustache. 

‚ÄúOh yeah, yessir, that'd be your only neighbor. Don't expect to borrow any sugar though, that place has been boarded up since I was a kid.‚Äù


I asked why he thought I'd be having a lot of fun, and I heard the deputy laugh through his paper cup as he shut an office door behind him. 

‚ÄúWell, that patch of ground has been neat for kids to explore and make spooky stories out of is all. Not just the kids though I guess, started ten or so years ago when an Old man was out fishin‚Äô and caught sight of the big guy.‚Äù 

He must have noticed my crooked brow because he patted me on the shoulder as he stood and held the door to his office open for me. 

‚ÄúIt's nothing at all, Ferris. Just a story. Besides, it's not something people are scared of, they want to see him. Nobody has ever been in my office screaming about Bigfoot killing their dog or something. It's just a fun little story for kids and old timers.‚Äù

I asked him if maybe he knew what happened to the last tenants out there, or maybe the ‚ÄúClark castle‚Äù, but the sheriff didn't really remember. The den we'd moved into wasn't really on his radar, but it was probably a place yuppies had owned as a summer vacation home. 

The Clark Castle though, he said, was an old story. Not a particularly thrilling one, just a big house built and left alone sometime in the thirties. 

I remember rambling off a couple spitfire questions as he lead me back to the lobby, a reassuring smile on his face and a pat on the back. 

Janice and Shane were there waiting for me, Shane's little head bustled into his mother's lap as he snored away. Janice held her head against the shoulder of the lobby chair, her own snores coming in soft and quiet. 

I woke them both, ushering them out the door with a gentle hand as I turned back to Gerald who called-

‚ÄúYou're all invited to dinner at mine on Sunday! If you're willing, I mean. It'd be a nice way to pull out the welcome mat.‚Äù

I thanked him. 

Off we went then, out down a list of boulevards and streets I had to follow from a map made of up red looping lines on a green landscape. 

In the dark, I'll add. 

Gerald hadn't been joking about the run from this dingy old double wide to the heart of town, we must have gone through thirteen miles of green, mountainous hell before I pulled the brake ahead of a large cattle gate.

I stepped out and got my key inside the lock, swinging the chain to the side and letting the gate creak open with an eerie screech. I pulled the car in and let the family out at the porch of our new country kingdom. 

Crickets and moths plagued the yard, the latter diving into my cheeks and forehead as I held little Shane in my arms and carried him inside. Janice had a bag tucked under her arm that she set aside as we shut the door behind us and I let her set out to the bedroom while I got Shane in his pajamas. 

He would sleep with us that night, and I was relieved that at the very least, the trailer had come furnished. 

A Dusty floral couch and an Sears catalog dining table awaited us inside. The floor was shag and I eyed suspicious black lumps that dotted the corners, having a hunch we'd walked into a roach graveyard. 

The bed was (thankfully) new, being a housewarming gift from Janice‚Äôs mother. I had hardly a glance at it before I saw my pajama-clad wife slip beneath the covers and slide off into Dreamland. Shane followed after, toothpaste foam still sticking to the corners of his mouth as he nuzzled in with her. 

I remember that as I flicked off that light switch, I saw the whole world fast asleep under those big plush blankets. 

But, I also remember the sweet, blissful taste of tobacco smoke as it danced against my tongue and slipped through my nostrils in a big cloud. 

Maybe I HAD promised to quit, But a couple Marlboros weren't gonna hurt anyone. Besides, the relief of being alone with something that was truly only mine was beautiful after a day like that.

And then, under the blanket of stars, I found a small moment of peace. 

My dad had smoked too. He's passed a long time now, but back then the tumors had only just found purchase in his lungs. He's been a resident in a facility since before Janice and I had gotten married. 

I hadn't visited him much. Shit, I wouldn't let Shane even grace him with a ‚ÄúHello‚Äù on the phone. Something's are best to be set in only a few words, and those are these: I wasn't terribly fond of my father. He was bad at being a parent, he was a drunk, and he'd wasted his life without me anywhere near him. 

I'd been terrified at the time, as the move got closer and closer, that maybe that man in the mirror I saw everyday was starting to look a bit too much like his dad.

I was only a year into the practice, but this firm was very well regarded and I was nervous that I'd gone and moved us out here just to fumble the ball.

In Arizona, I would handle Public Intoxication cases or small claims, but here I would be getting in an army that I wasn't so sure I was suited for. 

It was in those minutes outside, watching the smoke twist and swing through the air, that I noticed that the crickets had stopped chirping. 

I didn't know how long I'd stood there in the quiet, but the realization hit me and I felt the thoughts of my father slip away. 

It felt darker out there. 

Without the breeze rustling the leaves together, the air almost felt weighted. I was alone, I was sure. So why could I hear someone breathing?

It was there. Not close, not within ten feet. But passed the patchy grass and the fence-line, I could hear it. 

Deep, soft breaths. They were hasty, and even though they weren't next to me, I thought I could hear the wet tongue of something lashing in its mouth. 

I didn't finish that cigarette. Instead, I stood there and watched the black at the edge of the porch light, waiting to hear a pin drop. 

Maybe if I got a flashlight, I could catch whatever it was. Maybe it was a stray dog? Then the thoughts got worse. What if it was a bigger animal? I wouldn't want a mountain lion or a bobcat getting familiar with the property with Shane around. 

I turned slowly, but didn't dampen my steps. I was tired and stressed and ready to toss a rock at a dogs ass if it meant I could head to bed and get some sleep without worrying even more. 

I opened the front door, and stepped inside. 

In the saddle bag by the fridge I had a small silver flashlight, packed in case the power wasn't on by the time we were ready to move in. 

Next to it, unbeknownst to me, was an empty box. Like the idiot I was, I kicked it while getting at the bag and slipped on the shag carpet. I fell like a sack of grain onto the floor and felt my head knock into the edge of the kitchen counter. 

Stars danced around my head, and I angrily got up and dug into the bag. Finding the stupid little light, I kicked the box into the living room and swore I was going to burn it.

I opened the door and looked out there again, but the light slipped from my hand and bounced off the wooden slats with a clunk. 

Hanging from the banister below the porch roof was a snake. 

I nearly cursed, jumping back before letting the fact of the thing settle in. 

The snake was dead, its long, slender body wrapped in a snug knot around the wooden beam.

It's pattern shown a string of diamonds down its back and I looked up at the rattle as it hung down from the knot.

It's yellow eyes were wide and hollow, its mouth open and fangs showing like knives under the porch-light. 

It swung limply, as if it had only been stuck there a second before.

I refuse to act childish / stoop to her level, but things need to get done.  Lately she has been ""upset"" with me (over things I did that I believe I should be entitled to do) so logically she is trying to make my life a bit harder this week.  She asked that I prepare dinners for the entire week, for example.  I didn't agree to it; I just ignored it.  I work full time (she does not) and usually during the week she does the dinners, but some nights I can help and some days if I work from home I can also do things in between working.  I was working from home yesterday and I noticed by about 4 pm she had not begun any dinner.  Our kids need to eat.  I could just refuse as well and then who suffers, the kids.  So i just make them dinner and feed them.  I also put aside some for her--I'm not going to be a jerk back, that only makes it worse, and I let her know there is food (but she doesn't eat it).  I'm pretty exhausted after dinner and I don't want to clean up.  I have a beer on our porch and sit for 20 minutes.  It is close to the kids bedtime and I usually do the bedtime routine.  I do it.  I ask my wife if she would be able to clean the dishes (she is laying in bed).  She doesn't give a direct answer, but stretches and says she is tired.  Well she doesn't.  She goes to bed and gets up early today, sits downstairs having coffee for an hour, then goes running (she can run for an hour).  So i come downstairs, make myself coffee (because she didn't care to make enough for me) and see the dishes are still there.  Ok this is childish.  I am not going to play the who can hold out longer game.  Our kids will be up soon, their lunch boxes are in the sink, they need them cleaned.  There aren't even any clean spoons or forks for them for breakfast.  So I do the freakin' dishes.

This is ridiculous right?  Am I giving in to the abuse by refusing to give in to the immature behavior?  I RARELY ask my wife for anything and i specifically asked if she could do the dishes.  Yesterday I asked her for 3 things directly, in a nice way and she did 2 of them, but met each request with a snarky or sour tone.

Outside of punishing me for my crime of taking some independence in our house organization, my wife may think she is already doing enough--she often says I don't appreciate the things she does and she recently prepared a list of ""chores"" for us to split up.  So I could see this too.  I'm trying to give her the benefit here--she did do \*some\* things like laundry, tightened some screws on a door that was sagging, split the school drop offs and pick ups (though when I asked her to do the further school pickup after I did the drop off and it took an hour, she glared at me, not happy about it), but she also spent a lot of time relaxing on the couch or bed (though she is on her phone and may say she was shopping or doing something chore related), and she went out with a friend in the afternoon for a little over an hour before doing the ""harder"" school pickup.  I had to balance working the entire day with half the school dropoffs/pickups, morning routine, packing lunch, making dinner, and bed routine.  Even while making dinner I am on my work phone checking things and I get asked into a meeting, so I ask her if she can ""watch"" the food. She glares at me and i have to ask 5 times before she will give me a verbal answer, with a sour tone.

I hate the making lists stuff, but i feel like i've done my share and more here, and the few things I ask of her, she should be eager to do and not be trying to make me feel guilty just for asking.",1,1754995785.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

1mo5dt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1mo5dt9/half_lucid_dream_in_15_years/,Half lucid dream in 15+ years.,"Last night I had a half lucid dream. Some weird things were happening, and when I saw my boyfriend doubled I was thinking something is wrong right now. Then in that same dream, a friend was being mean and I realised it was not my friend, he wouldn't speak to me like that. So in my dream, I thought since I know I'm dreaming, I should tell my boyfriend that I need to wake up. When I was walking back to the start of the dream (very weird, it's a dream after all) I saw the situation that I'd just dreamed about happening next to me with my boyfriend and me walking as if we were clones. I went to my 'real' boyfriend (obviously not real but I felt as if this one was the real one). He was in a hospital bed, my best friend (not real, I could see or feel that this was a dream character what should display my best friend) to get some coffee outside of the room. Then I told my boyfriend I knew I was dreaming and that I needed to wake up. Probably because somewhere I was scared of being stuck in a dream (I've read about this before). Once I did, I woke up and fully realised I was dreaming and was half aware of it!

1mo5dqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mo5dqm/a_copy_of_my_wife_and_kids_deep_in_the_woods/,"A Copy of My Wife and Kids, Deep in the Woods","It all started last-last weekend. I had parked just shy of the forestry gate, where the gravel thinned out, and the trees began thickening. From here, it was a few hours on foot - just enough time and distance to let the peacefulness settle in. That was all I really wanted - a little quiet. No reception, no chatter; just the trail ahead, and whatever passed for clarity in this day and age.

I left my phone in the glovebox. Not to make a statement as such - I just didn‚Äôt want to feel it buzzing in my pocket, needing, reminding.

The air smelled clean. Pine, crisp northern winds, and something familiar and damp, like the memory of water that had long since sunk into the ground. I slung my pack over one shoulder, and started walking, letting the rhythm pull me listlessly forward. There was just something calming about walking alone - neither too fast, nor too slow - exactly my own pace - that made me feel like I had a little more control over my life again.

The trees weren‚Äôt especially tall, leaning just slightly inward, as if they had something to confide in me - an innocent little secret between myself and the forest. The path wound forward, without promise or urgency. Late afternoon light filtered through the canopy like little threads of gold; slow dissolves, like a weary, introverted sun who had enough of being directly seen.

Time stretched ever forward, like a lazy cat, greeting its owner after a long, grueling day at work. After a while, I stopped walking in minutes, and began walking in distances-between-thoughts.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt exactly looking for anything. I wasn‚Äôt really running from anything either.

I told them I‚Äôd be back the next morning. Maybe a touch later. Just needed a breather, I said. They nodded - not dismissively, perhaps just- tired in their own ways. Maybe they were happy to have the house to themselves for a change.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. We used to move like parts of the same body - not exactly perfect, but - close enough to feel whole. There was a sort of rhythm in the way we bickered, laughed, touched elbows at the dinner table.

And then came the camping trip, last month. What was meant to be a long weekend away in the mountains - a break from all the screens and internet. It happened suddenly. I went ahead to look for firewood, and they took a wrong turn trying to follow.

I found them again, a full week later.

They‚Äôd turned up some fifty miles north, by a reservoir I‚Äôd driven past some hundreds of times during my search. No injuries, no scratches, barely a clear story. Just tears and hugs and confused explanations. Something about getting turned around, following odd trails.¬†

It didn‚Äôt matter anymore, though. I had found them again.

But something had changed, subtly, after that. They were a touch quieter, somehow. Or maybe it was me. Maybe I‚Äôd stared at that empty tent for too long, whispering their names into the dark. Maybe I‚Äôd come too close to accepting the idea that they were gone forever.

We never really broached the subject. After the initial joy wore off, we just drifted back into routine. Work. School. House-chores. But somehow, things never quite clicked back into place. The pieces all looked the same - they still laughed at the same shows, still left dishes half-done in the sink, but - it still didn‚Äôt quite feel the same.

My son and daughter, Alex and Ellie, stopped asking me to read before bed. My wife, Lauren, started waking up before me, and taking long walks alone. Sometimes, I‚Äôd find them all together, sitting in the living room, discussing something that went quiet as soon as I entered. Not secretive - just‚Ä¶ separate.

I never resented them for it. Nor did I feel especially left out. Mostly, it just felt like the threads that had tied us together had loosened, just a little. They were still mine, as far as I was concerned. Still loved me. But sometimes, when they laughed too hard at nothing I could hear - when they exchanged glances I couldn‚Äôt decipher, I‚Äôd catch myself thinking: these are the versions that came back.

And wondering if that was enough for me.

I must have walked for hours.

Not with purpose. Not really. Just following one trail after another, watching the way the sun filtered through the leaves, letting it all pull me deeper into the woods. A part of me was hoping I‚Äôd get tired. That I‚Äôd sit down somewhere and clear my head.

But I didn‚Äôt. I kept walking.

Past old logging stumps, crooked stone outcroppings, and mossy bridges, I kept thinking about home - how the house might feel right now. Quiet. Stretched thin. I imagined Lauren sitting at the kitchen table, flicking through her phone. Ellie and Alex squabbling in the other room, half-bored, half-wired from screen time. The little life we‚Äôd built together still buzzing along without me.

The sun kept sinking. The woods turned golden, then bronze, then something colder - all gray tree trunks and long blue shadows. I found myself on a ridge I didn‚Äôt recognize. The trail had thinned to little more than deer path.

I stood still for a while, watching the sun brush its last warmth across the trees.

The light had gone syrupy - thick and golden, oozing between the trunks like it was reluctant to leave. Shadows stretched long and crooked, flickering softly as the wind stirred the upper branches. A pair of birds darted overhead, trailing a thread of sound behind them that frayed and vanished into the stillness.

Everything felt paused, like the forest was holding its breath, waiting to see what I‚Äôd do.

I sighed. Adjusted the strap of my pack. And turned around.

Time to man up. Go back. Face the noise, the mess, the tight little world that waited for me.

I took the same path, weaving through underbrush in the reverse of my own trail. Branches snagged less this time. The air felt cooler. Quieter, too. Not dead, but subdued. The way it sometimes got before the evening birds started their songs.

Up ahead, I could just make out the turnoff that led toward the trailhead, toward the gravel lot where my truck waited. I pictured the climb down, the way the headlights would cut through the blue dusk. Maybe I‚Äôd stop somewhere on the drive back. Get Lauren‚Äôs favorite milk. Try to do something right. I stepped forward-

A voice. Low. Close.

‚ÄúDaniel?‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúDaniel ‚Äî is that you?‚Äù

*Lauren?*

I turned.

The trees swayed gently.

‚ÄúPlease. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know where I am.‚Äù

I stood at the edge of the trail, breath sharp in my throat.

‚ÄúDaniel, please.‚Äù

Her voice again. Almost whimpering.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm hurt.‚Äù

My mouth went dry. A strange urge to run. But it was her voice. Not just the sound ‚Äî the cadence. That soft, uncertain rise she used to have when trying not to cry.

The one I hadn‚Äôt heard in years.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

Another voice. Higher. Cracking at the edges.

‚ÄúDad, where are you?‚Äù

Alex.

Then ‚Äî barely a beat later:

‚ÄúDaddy? I‚Äôm scared. Where are you?‚Äù

Ellie.

Her voice shook ‚Äî the exact pitch she‚Äôd used when the power went out, when she was six and couldn‚Äôt find her nightlight.

My hands trembled.

Because I‚Äôd heard these voices before. But not like this. Not since before the camping trip.

Before they came home colder. Distant.

Smiling too tightly. Hugging too briefly.

Back when they still looked at me like I was theirs.

‚ÄúDaniel?‚Äù

Lauren again. Just over the ridge.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù

The words escaped before I could stop them.

Then - the dry crunch of leaves underfoot. A rhythm. Getting closer.

I turned.

Three figures emerged from the brush - clothes torn, faces streaked with soot and dirt.

Lauren stumbled toward me. Then the kids. Ellie clinging to Alex‚Äôs arm, eyes wide with a desperate, aching kind of hope.

‚ÄúDaniel,‚Äù Lauren whispered, voice cracking. ‚ÄúOh my god - Daniel!‚Äù

She threw her arms around me. I caught her on reflex. Felt her weight, the tension in her limbs. She smelled like pine and smoke and sweat.

She smelled real.

The kids were next. Alex burying his face in my coat, Ellie‚Äôs arms locking tight around my ribs.

‚ÄúWe- we didn‚Äôt know where you went,‚Äù Lauren said. ‚ÄúEverything was strange. The trees‚Ä¶ they kept changing. We thought‚Ä¶‚Äù

She pulled back. Studied my face.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I wanted to say yes.

They felt solid. Familiar.

They clung to me like people who‚Äôd survived something unspeakable.

And for one trembling second, I almost believed.

But then, like a crack through glass:

*Weren‚Äôt they supposed to be home?*

I didn‚Äôt say it aloud, but I must have felt something was wrong. That subtle stiffness in my shoulders. The way my eyes kept flicking around without thought. The way I stayed one step behind them as we walked.

I told myself the only explanation that made sense - that they‚Äôd come out looking for me in the dead of night and gotten lost. The woods could twist and turn you without warning. Maybe they‚Äôd just wandered too far. Long enough to lose their bearings. Long enough to feel scared.

But something deeper disagreed. A quiet wrongness that wouldn‚Äôt settle.

Like stepping into a familiar room where everything‚Äôs been moved half an inch.

Your body notices, even if your mind can‚Äôt say why.

I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to ask. I was scared of their answer - scared of what it might mean. So I said nothing. Just led them toward the road.

We didn‚Äôt talk much on the way. They were exhausted. Ellie tripped twice, and I carried her for a while. Lauren kept glancing at me like she was afraid I‚Äôd vanish again if she looked away. I smiled each time, told her we‚Äôd figure everything out soon.

‚Ä¶

We reached the truck just before dusk. Lauren laughed, soft and dazed, when she saw it.

‚ÄúYou still drive this old thing?‚Äù

I nodded - not responding in words, unlocking the door.

Ellie fell asleep leaning against the window as soon as we pulled onto the road. Lauren held her hand. I kept both eyes on the stretching lines of the highway, stealing glances at my family every so often - just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt dreaming it all.

‚Ä¶

But of course, reality had to eventually come crashing down.

We pulled into the driveway just as the porch light came on. I killed the engine. The truck was filled with silence - the kind that comes right at the precipice of the irreversible.

For a second, I just sat there. One hand rested on the wheel. My reflection in the windshield betraying my apprehension back to me. Lauren stirred beside me. Ellie and Alex yawned in the back seat, stretching and blinking themselves awake.

Then the front door creaked open.

And Lauren - the other Lauren - stepped out onto the porch. My Lauren. At least, the Lauren that I‚Äôd kissed goodbye that morning. Her hair was still tied up from cooking, and she was wiping her hands off with a dish towel.

She smiled when she saw the truck. Familiar. Unbothered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back early - do you want sup-‚Äù

Then she saw them.¬†

Her voice cut mid-syllable.

The dish towel fluttered down onto the gravel at her feet.

I could barely breathe - my hand on the cab door - stuck half open.

The other Lauren - the one in the car with me - had gone ghostly pale. Her eyes locked on the woman standing on the porch. Her mouth moved - once, twice - without any sound.

Ellie gripped my sleeve, whispering.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. All I could see was Lauren looking at Lauren. My eyes filled with something beyond fear. The one question I'd dreaded the possibility of having to ask.

*If she‚Äôs here, at home‚Ä¶ then who did I bring back?*

Porch-Lauren took a step back. Her eyes were locked on the woman beside me - the same face, the same eyes, the same trembling lips.

‚ÄúDaniel‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, barely an audible whisper. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

I glanced at her, and back at the Lauren next to me. Her hand rested, faintly, against the passenger-side door. She looked like she was on the edge of collapsing inward.

The words turned to ash in my mouth.

Porch-Lauren stood there, not crying, but tears streaming down her face nonetheless.

Porch-Alex‚Äôs hand had flown up to cover his mouth, and porch-Ellie held her head in her hands, whispering *no no no* to herself, backing toward the house like she could undo it all by stepping out of frame.

The ones beside me?

Frozen.

Staring.

Mouths agape.

As if struggling to comprehend the crushing weight of truth that had fallen onto them.

For a moment, I felt nothing. No fear, no anger - just a kind of supernatural stillness. The shapes beside me‚Ä¶ they fit in all the ways they were supposed to. Like the way they did before the camping trip. Like in the way Lauren leaned slightly toward the sound of my breath. Like the way Alex always stood behind Ellie, comforting her in distressing situations. And yet, something about the symmetry - the doubling - made it all feel like a lie told too well. I didn‚Äôt know - I couldn‚Äôt know - which direction the truth was facing.

I looked back up at porch-Lauren, who had begun to take on the essence of something colder and sharper in her expression. Her gaze shifted between me and her counterpart, then to the kids standing behind her - and then to the kids in the car.

She didn‚Äôt scream. She didn‚Äôt run. She just stood there, hands shaking, resolutely against the impossibility, and said:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not coming inside.‚Äù

The other Lauren flinched. I felt it - the sharp, anxious breath she took through her teeth. Ellie gripped my sleeve tighter.

‚ÄúLauren‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, voice straining as the words felt like ash in my mouth. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. I don‚Äôt think - I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre copies. Or.. or if something else happened. If they got lost-‚Äù

She shook her head.

Hard. Once.

That was all.

No words. No outburst. Just that one, solid refusal - and I understood what she meant. Some truths can‚Äôt be stretched. Some lines you just don‚Äôt cross, even if the world‚Äôs split clean down the middle.

The silence held - taught as a wire - until I spoke again.

‚ÄúThe guesthouse. They can stay there. Just for now. Until we figure this out.‚Äù

Porch-Lauren‚Äôs jaw tightened. She didn‚Äôt look at me. Her eyes stayed locked on her - the mirror version, now standing ten feet away in the flickering porch light.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, quietly.

‚ÄúLauren,‚Äù I said, softer still, pleading. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt go back out there, in the forest. The kids - look at them. They‚Äôre just scared. Confused. Maybe we all are.‚Äù

She still didn‚Äôt look at me. But I saw her blink, considering my words. Then she stepped back into the doorway, her voice as brittle as glass.

‚ÄúFine. But they‚Äôre not coming in this house.‚Äù

She turned away and disappeared into the hallway, the screen door slapping shut behind her.

I stood in the gravel, heart thudding.

Behind me, Lauren - the other Lauren - let out a shaky breath. Ellie was still pressed against me. Alex said nothing at all.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs this way.‚Äù

We moved past the main house in silence, feet crunching over the gravel. I felt the presence of my other family still lingering behind the windows - watching. Or hiding. Maybe both.

The guesthouse sat at the back of the property, on the other side of our garden, half-covered in vines, paint peeling in the corners. It hadn‚Äôt been used in months.

I unlocked the door with the key hidden under the planter, and stepped inside, turning on the single ceiling bulb. The air was stale, and dust floated like soft static in the light rays.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much,‚Äù I said, voice thin. ‚ÄúBut at least you‚Äôll have a roof over your head, while we figure things out.‚Äù

Lauren nodded, numb.

Alex sat down, heavily, on the couch and put his head in his hands. Ellie curled up next to him.

I stood there, hand still on the doorknob, not knowing which direction to turn.

*If they‚Äôre not real‚Ä¶ then why does it feel like I‚Äôm abandoning them again?*

‚Ä¶

After much hesitation, I slept in the main house that night.

Lauren didn‚Äôt say anything when I came in. She was already in bed, facing the window, sheets pulled up over her shoulders. The room smelled of lavender and eucalyptus - the same diffuser as we‚Äôve always used.

I didn‚Äôt bother showering. I just peeled off my clothes, and climbed in beside her. The mattress shifted under my weight. She didn‚Äôt move. Not an inch.

Her back was warm against my shoulder, her breathing steady.

I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling. I listened to her breaths.

*Inhale.*

*Pause.*

*Exhale.*

*Pause.*

*Repeat.*

They were perfect. Almost‚Ä¶ too perfect. Rhythmic in a way that felt practiced - subtly stiff. Like she knew I was listening.

I tried to convince myself that was ridiculous, but I couldn‚Äôt stop.

I kept thinking about the other Lauren - curled up on the guesthouse couch, with a blanket wrapped around her knees, exhausted- but in a real way that I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. The tremble in her voice. The weight of her hand on my shoulders.

And here, beside me, was a woman who knew all our inside jokes, our favorite recipes, the shape of my back, the ache in my knee from that old ladder fall.

But suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time she had looked at me in the way guesthouse-Lauren had.

Not really, anyway.

Her breath hitched - just once. Maybe she felt me watching. Maybe she was just shifting in her sleep.

I closed my eyes and tried to match her rhythm. But it wasn‚Äôt until I started counting backward, that I realized I‚Äôd been holding my breath this whole time.

‚Ä¶

That night, I dreamt of the guesthouse.

It was warm.

Light spilled forth from every lamp, like poured amber. The air buzzed faintly with music - some old folk song, hazy and half-remembered, spilling from a radio that no longer worked. The walls were a different color, a sunny eggshell I didn‚Äôt recognize. The kind of color that made you feel safe.

Lauren brought out a platter of waffles and bacon, smiling wide. Ellie set the table, her cheeks pink with laughter. Alex leaned back in his chair mid-sentence, recounting some old story from school, with way too many detours. Everything shimmered with just the right kind of joy.

I ate without thinking.

I laughed when they laughed.

The windows were fogged from the heat, but the glass door - the one facing the main house - stayed clear. And at some point, without realizing when, I began to feel them.

Eyes on me.

Three figures.

Standing inside the house.

Watching.

I didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt speak.

But something made me glance up from my plate.

The lights in the main house were off.

In the hazy glow of indirect sunlight, by the window stood Lauren. Ellie. Alex.

Still. Expressionless. Perfectly visible through the window, as if they‚Äôd been there the whole time.

They didn‚Äôt wave. Didn‚Äôt knock. Just stared, faces flat and unreadable, like portraits hung behind glass.

Ellie‚Äôs hand was against the pane. Not pressed - just resting. Her breath left no fog.

Inside the guesthouse, laughter swelled again - Alex laughing too hard at a joke no-one told. Lauren refilling my glass, despite it being full to the brim. Ellie brushing crumbs onto my shirt with practiced, doting hands.

But I kept looking at the house.

At the three shapes inside it.

The guesthouse grew hotter, brighter. The air began to buzz louder, and that looping, familiar tune warped out of recognition.

I woke up with a start. No gasping. No sweat. Just the peculiar feeling - like something had been added to me while I slept.

Lauren was still beside me. Breathing steady. The same pattern as before.

But then I began to notice a hum, soft, almost below the threshold of sound.¬†

*Had it been there the whole time?*

‚Ä¶

I told myself I needed air. That was all. Just space. Just a few minutes away from the stiff, awkward silence of my bedroom.

I wandered down the steps to the guesthouse. The door was slightly open.

Inside: warmth.

It smelled like butter. Like browning toast and something just familiar enough to sting. Light spilled through the blinds in thin, golden slats, catching dust in the air like snow.

Lauren stood at the stove, barefoot. Humming something tuneless, but very much her own. Her hair was tied up in a loose bun - the way it used to be when the kids were still little. She didn‚Äôt look up.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be up yet,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt sleep very well.‚Äù

She smiled, just faintly. ‚ÄúFelt like cooking.‚Äù

I stepped inside and saw the pan. Scrambled eggs. Bright yellow, just the way she used to make them. A half-handful of cheddar. Chives. No milk. She always said milk made them rubbery.

House-Lauren had been making them differently lately. A bit harder than I remember. A bit denser. Like she‚Äôd somehow forgotten the rhythm of it.

I sat. I ate.

They tasted right.

Everything felt just right.

I looked around. The guesthouse felt softer, somehow - as if the overnight presence of Lauren and the kids had made its spirit whole. The old mugs, which used to sit untouched on the shelf like forgotten props, now looked lived-in - well-loved. Ellie‚Äôs blanket, tucked gently under her chin as she slept curled on the couch, no longer looked like something we‚Äôd thrown in the guesthouse ‚Äòjust in case; - it looked like it had always belonged to her - smelling faintly of childhood and weekend morning cartoons.

Hesitantly, begrudgingly, I took slow steps, returning back to the main house. Alex had held my hand, asking me to stay longer, and I rustled his hair, promising I‚Äôd come back.¬†

The house felt colder. House-Lauren was just coming down the stairs as I slipped through the door, dressed and alert, but with that sort of washed-out look - like a painting left out in the sun for too long.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early,‚Äù I said.

She glanced at me, then away. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou hungry?‚Äù she asked, already halfway through the kitchen. ‚ÄúI could make eggs.‚Äù

I hesitated - way too long. There was a picture in my mind I couldn‚Äôt shake: the steam wafting off the plate in the guesthouse . The smell of browning butter. The way guesthouse-Lauren had sprinkled on extra chives just-so.

‚ÄúI ate,‚Äù I said.

She paused. Her hand hovered just a moment too long on the fridge handle, before letting it fall.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù she said, softly. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

She began cooking. Just with three fewer eggs than usual. One fewer slice of toast than usual.

From the hallway, I could hear Alex shifting in the living room, his chair creaking like an hold hinge. Not speaking. Just listening.

I lingered in the hall longer than I meant to.

The kettle clicked off behind her, but Lauren - House-Lauren - didn‚Äôt move right away. She was moving through the rhythm of breakfast - reaching for plates, twisting the burner on - but something about it felt unfamiliar. Just in the way a childhood song sounds when someone else hums it.

I kept my eyes on the floor, the table, the faint streaks of morning light that filtered in through the blinds. But I could feel her watching me in pieces. Never directly - glances from the corner of her eye as she moved.

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

And neither did she.

I moved to the living room, and switched on the desktop computer in the corner. I wasn‚Äôt even sure what I planned to do - any kind of work to make the hours pass.

House-Alex was curled at the far end of the couch, knees pulled up, a book open in his lap. But his eyes weren‚Äôt on the pages. They stayed fixed on the window - or maybe on the glass itself, where my reflection flickered with every shift and keystroke.

Each tap of my keyboard sounded too loud in the quiet room. Sharp. I could feel him listening to every press. I didn‚Äôt look at him, but I could feel his attention. Not accusing, just‚Ä¶ watchful. And I thought of guesthouse-Alex. How easily he‚Äôd folded himself to my side, hand in mine. Of the way he‚Äôd smiled when I promised I‚Äôd be back.

Here, house-Alex just sat still. Like a photograph I wasn‚Äôt meant to touch.

‚Ä¶

Lunch was sandwiches. Soggy in the middle. Too much mayo.

We ate in silence. Alex listlessly scrolled his phone under the table. Ellie took hers apart bite by bite, crust first. Lauren barely touched hers.

I sat at the living room coffee table after, handling some bills and doing some accounting. Trying to work - or at least pretending to. My fingers stayed on the same lines of print for hours. The light shifted across the floor in slow bands, but never moved.

From where I was, I could see the guesthouse through the window. Just a sliver of it between the hedges. Nothing specific - just a corner of white siding, and the glint of sunlight off the glass.

I kept glancing at it. Unconsciously at first. Then with intention. The way you look at a shut door, when you‚Äôre waiting for someone to knock.

House-Lauren noticed. Of course she did.

By the thrd time she caught me looking, her hands slowed as she peeled carrots over the sink. She didn‚Äôt say anything.

By the fifth, she set her peeler down.

Dinner was almost ready when she finally spoke. Her back still to me.

‚ÄúIf you want to eat with them,‚Äù she said, voice even, ‚Äúgo. I don‚Äôt really care.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to protest. To explain. But there was nothing I could‚Äôve said that didn‚Äôt sound like a complete lie. She wiped her hands on a dishtowel. Turned back to the stove.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to beg you to stay.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt say anything when I left. House-Lauren kept cooking. House-Ellie locked herself up in her room. House-Alex stayed curled up on that couch, his eyes tracking my position as I tracked through the living room, and out into the garden.

The door to the guesthouse opened before I could knock.

Lauren was already setting the table - four plates, cloth napkins, charming old silverware. Like we used to do when the kids were little, and everything still felt worth the effort. The food was simple. Warm. steaming.

Alex and Ellie were already seated, talking softly about something. Not their day - nothing present-tense. It was a conversation pulled from some half-remembered Saturday, the kind that ends in laughter over nothing at all.

It didn‚Äôt feel like a trick.

It felt like being remembered.

I sat down. Ate. The way I hadn‚Äôt in weeks.

But at some point - between bites, between laughter - I glanced out the window. Toward the house.

They were there.

Lauren. Alex. Ellie.

Standing at the sliding door, backlit by the kitchen lights, not moving. Not speaking. Just watching. Their faces unreadable. Unmoving.¬†

For a long, flickering second, the air tasted like salt again.

No one at the guesthouse table noticed.

‚Ä¶

I told myself I‚Äôd just lie down for a minute after dinner. Just a moment, to clear my head. The couch still smelled like us ‚Äî like the fabric softener she used, the cheap one we could never agree on.

I closed my eyes.

When I woke, it was light.

Too light.

I sat up, disoriented, throat dry.

The house across the lawn was still. No lights. No movement. I checked my phone.

8:42 a.m.

I walked up the path slow, stomach twisted. The front door was unlocked.

Inside, it was quiet.

Too quiet.

House-Ellie and house-Alex were still asleep, curled together on the couch like they‚Äôd drifted off watching TV.

But house-Lauren was gone.

On the desk by the hallway, something waited.

Two notes.¬†

The first was folded neatly into thirds. I opened it. It was in Lauren‚Äôs handwriting:

*""Alex,*

*I‚Äôve gone to bring your father home.*

*Your real one.*

*Do not let the one here into the house.*

*Keep Ellie close.*

*Mom""*

Just like that. Not a goodbye. Not an explanation.

My chest felt tight, like something had been carved out without me noticing, and I was only now discovering the hollow. A metallic taste crept into my mouth.

And then I looked down again and saw it.

A second slip of paper, tucked beneath a cup.

It was creased. Worn. As if it had been carried around in someone‚Äôs pocket. Reread more than once.

The handwriting was mine.

My handwriting.

But I didn‚Äôt remember writing it.

And before I could stop myself, I was reading.

*""Lauren,*

*I‚Äôve been watching the house from the treeline.*

*I see someone who looks like me inside.*

*He‚Äôs with you. With the kids. Living my life.*

*I don‚Äôt know who he is, or how this happened, but I remember everything. I remember Ellie‚Äôs birthmark behind her left knee. The way Alex used to cry when the radiator clicked on at night. I remember the night you lost your voice and still hummed to calm them both. He won‚Äôt get those right.*

*I‚Äôm scared that if I try anything, he‚Äôll hurt you.*

*Please, if you believe me - meet me at the booth in the back of the coffee shop where we first met. I‚Äôll be waiting.*

*Don‚Äôt let him in.*

*Don‚Äôt let him see this.*

*I love you.*

*Daniel""*

I stared at the letter, fingers cold around the edges.

My mind raced, but nothing landed. Thoughts skidded across the surface like stones on ice, never sinking deep enough to mean anything.

Suddenly -

Gravel crunched outside. A car door slammed.

The door swung open and she stood there, wind-tossed and flushed. A cold line of sweat down her temple. And behind her stood‚Ä¶ him, hanging just a step back in the shade like a shadow pretending to wait its turn.

I stood from the little kitchen table.

‚ÄúI knew it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou were never real.‚Äù

Her mouth parted, brow creasing. ‚ÄúDaniel‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt use my name like you have any right to it.‚Äù My voice cracked and kept going. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve known. You‚Äôve been different since the woods. Distant. Cold.‚Äù

The man behind her tilted his head.

‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôve brought him?‚Äù I stepped forward, hands out, like I could physically keep them from entering. ‚ÄúWhat, is this a trade? Your real husband?‚Äù

Her face twisted. ‚ÄúYou think I wanted this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou brought him here!‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I thought you weren‚Äôt real!‚Äù she snapped.

Silence.

Even he stilled.

Her voice dropped. ‚ÄúI waited. I waited for you. But something‚Äôs been wrong. I kept thinking‚Ä¶ what if they got you instead? What if he was still out there, trying to get back?‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou really believe that?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou really think I‚Äôd come back and‚Ä¶ what? Forget how you like your coffee? Forget how Ellie always sleeps with one sock on? Just get it close enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt see it?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been looking at them! Out there! In the guesthouse! Like they‚Äôre your real family‚Ä¶ Like I‚Äôm the replacement.‚Äù

We stared at each other.

And then we both turned, slowly. To look at him.

He smiled, just a little.

And said nothing.

Then suddenly - the feeling of Ellie, pressing up against me.

I didn‚Äôt look down at first. Just let her cling to my side, small and trembling. Maybe she didn‚Äôt want to see us fight, I thought. Maybe it all scared her. Of course it would have.

I placed a hand on her back, gently.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I murmured, voice raw. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be okay.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I felt it.

A sting, sharp and sudden, down near my thigh, like a needle slipping in sideways. I flinched, eyes darting down, and for a split second, I didn‚Äôt understand what I was looking at.

And then, something else.

A flicker.

Her shirt; it wasn‚Äôt the same one.

Not the faded cartoon one she‚Äôd been wearing on the couch. Not the one I‚Äôd carefully tucked the blanket around just that morning.

This was the other one.

The one guesthouse-Ellie had been wearing.

The cold came next. Blooming outward from the puncture.

I looked at her face. Sweet. Unblinking.

‚ÄúI missed you, Daddy,‚Äù she said.¬†

But she wasn‚Äôt saying it to me.

And then everything started to tilt. The ceiling slid away like paper.

The last thing I saw before it all folded was house-Lauren, her eyes wide. Not with anger anymore, but horror. Recognition.

As we fell, she met my eyes.

My Lauren.

And then the dark came down, gentle and complete.

‚Ä¶

I woke to the low hum of the basement furnace.

Dim light filtered through the small slit of a ground-level window, dust dancing in the beam like ash suspended in amber. My leg pulsed dully in a distant ache. My back pressed against cool concrete, and beside me, warmth.

Lauren.

Her head rested against my shoulder, one hand curled lightly near my chest, as if she‚Äôd fallen asleep mid-reach.

Just beyond her, tucked beneath an old wool blanket, were Alex and Ellie. Curled together on a pile of stored winter coats, pale and still.

They hadn‚Äôt stirred.

I didn‚Äôt move at first. Just listened. The silence wasn‚Äôt total. Pipes creaked overhead, and somewhere far above, something akin to footsteps shifted. But down here, it was still.

Lauren stirred. Blinked.

Then looked at me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here,‚Äù she whispered, voice hoarse from sleep.

I nodded. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go.‚Äù

She sat up slowly, her eyes flicking past me toward the children. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still out?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever they gave us‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll wear off,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEventually.‚Äù

She let out a breath - long and unsteady. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd lost you again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought I was the one being replaced,‚Äù I said quietly.

‚ÄúWe both did,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúWe were both so scared of being wrong.‚Äù

For a moment, neither of us spoke, as if allowing the squeaky pipes above to weigh in on our conversation.

Then she said:

‚ÄúLooking back‚Ä¶ the way Alex stared at you so intently - I think he knew. In his heart of hearts, I think he recognized you. Even when I couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I followed her gaze. Alex‚Äôs arm had fallen across Ellie protectively, fingers twitching now and then.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt spend enough time with him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAlways focused on Ellie. She needed more help. Or maybe I just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know how to talk to a boy that age without screwing it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe never took it that way,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe looks up to you, Daniel. Even when he was scared, he watched you like he was waiting for something.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought he was just afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúBut not of you.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. My throat burned.

‚ÄúI wanted to believe it wasn‚Äôt you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause if it was, then I‚Äôd have to admit I almost gave you up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to believe you weren‚Äôt real,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBecause if you were, then I‚Äôd have to admit I couldn‚Äôt tell. That I failed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were both fools.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre still here.‚Äù

We sat in silence, the weight of everything unspoken thick around us. Just the four of us now; one family, stunned and quiet and still alive, as morning crept across the world above.

Just then, I heard a small, sharp inhale.

Alex stirred among the winter coats, face scrunching up as if trying to push the sleep out from behind his eyes.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù he whispered.

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, buddy?‚Äù

He looked to Lauren. Then to Ellie, who shifted in his arms a second later, rubbing her eyes and curling instinctively toward the sound of our voices.

Her voice was even smaller. ‚ÄúAre we home?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to answer that. But Lauren did.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre together,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what matters.‚Äù

Alex sat up. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still here, aren‚Äôt they? The other ones?‚Äù

Lauren nodded grimly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not safe yet. But we will be.‚Äù

There was no grand declaration. No rousing speech. Just the quiet resolve that passes between people who have nothing left to lose.

We began to plan.

‚Ä¶

It was our seventh day down in the basement.¬† The bruises had faded. The cuts had scabbed. But the house was still wrong. Still watching.

Down in the basement, we ran through the routine one last time. Bags packed. Paths memorized.

Lauren adjusted the strap on Ellie‚Äôs backpack, her hands steady.

Alex looked to me. ‚ÄúWe ready?‚Äù

I looked at all of them.

And nodded.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

The lock on the basement door gave a soft click, almost imperceptible, as the paperclip - one we managed to scrounge up among the basement clutter - twisted in Lauren‚Äôs shaking hands.

She let out the barest breath. Relief. Fear.

I pushed the door open an inch at a time, listening.

No footsteps.

We'd studied them for days - the rhythms above us, their routines. Their lives. We knew when the kitchen floor would creak, when they paused in the hallway to murmur just out of earshot.

Up the stairs. One by one.

We held our bags tight. Left the heavier things behind. One chance.

The hallway yawned ahead, quiet and dim.

We crept past the coat rack. Past the shoe mat. Every breath loud in my chest.

The front door waited, barely ten feet away.

I reached out.

Fingers touched the knob.

Turned.

I turned, just long enough to find Lauren‚Äôs hand behind me.

And then I felt it.

A sting. Low, sharp, buried near the hip.

Another.

Her breath caught - a thin gasp.

I spun.

Ellie stood behind me. And Alex. Pale. Wide-eyed. But wrong.

The way Alex‚Äôs shoulders sat. The way Ellie‚Äôs hair curled too neatly at the ends.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I breathed. The cold was already spreading. ""Why would you-""

They said nothing.

Then, from the living room down the hall, a sound. Struggling. Wet cloth against duct tape.

And I saw them through the doorframe. Tied. Gagged. The real Alex. The real Ellie. Eyes wide. Desperate. Locked on mine.

Behind me, the others stood quietly.

And smiled.

I stumbled backward, eyes locked on the children ‚Äî no, not children ‚Äî things wearing my children‚Äôs faces. My legs felt hollow. Cold bloomed outward from the punctures like frost through old pipes.

And then he stepped into view.

From the living room. From behind the real children.

Me.

Or something wearing me just right.

Faux-Daniel's smile was gentle. Familiar. Off by half a second.

""Going somewhere?"" he asked.

Lauren moved before I could stop her.

She slammed her shoulder into me, drove me backward toward the door. I tried to catch her, but my limbs wouldn‚Äôt cooperate.

The door swung open behind me.

Light. Air. Cold and real.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù she screamed. Her voice cracked - desperate and raw - and she shoved again, hard.

I stumbled out onto the porch. The world tilted. My feet found gravel, then grass, then pavement.

Behind me, the door swung shut.

Just before it closed, I looked back.

He was there.

My double. Standing in the doorway, framed by the house light.

And Lauren. My Lauren - no longer screaming, no longer fighting - caught between them.

Then the latch clicked.

And I was alone.

Standing in the middle of the road, breath like fog in the night air, legs shaking.

‚Ä¶

I ran. Or tried to.

The cold in my limbs made everything feel distant, rubbery. I stumbled down the road, shoes slapping the wet pavement. Houses passed by like memories ‚Äî flickering porch lights, curtains shifting.

I must‚Äôve walked for hours.

Or minutes. Time bent strangely around me, refusing to settle.

Eventually, someone found me. An older man, maybe, or a teenager - I can‚Äôt remember exactly. They helped me into their truck, asked questions I couldn‚Äôt answer, dropped me off outside a 24-hour diner with a motel next door.

Now I‚Äôm here. In some dingy motel room, the walls thin enough to hear the neighbors arguing two doors down.

I haven‚Äôt slept.

I keep picturing Lauren‚Äôs face in that doorway. Her eyes when she pushed me. The look she gave me ‚Äî not just desperate. Trusting. Like she believed I could fix this.

So I will.

Because if I don‚Äôt - if I leave them there, living out some mimicry of our life, with those things wearing our faces, then no one else ever will.

Because I saw the fear in Alex‚Äôs eyes. I heard Ellie‚Äôs muffled cries.

Because she chose me.

Because I‚Äôm still me.

I had once thought about driving straight to the sheriff‚Äôs office. Telling someone what had happened. But the more I played it out in my head, the clearer it became.

They weren‚Äôt hiding.

They were living. Shopping at the same grocery store. Answering the same phone. Taking the kids to school in my car, waving at the neighbors.

They had proof. Alibis. A full week of surveillance footage if anyone bothered to check.

I didn‚Äôt have anything. No wounds. No evidence of a struggle. Just a story that sounded like a breakdown.

And what if I did tell someone? What if the cops did come knocking?

What would stop them from opening the basement door‚Ä¶ and finding it empty?

From smiling and saying, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one else here.‚Äù

From killing them and burying them in the time it took me to get a search warrant.

Ever have one of those days where your brain feels like jelly and your to-do list is staring at you like a disgruntled toddler? ü§î Yeah, me too. We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîlost in the fog of unproductivity, questioning all your life choices, wondering if you‚Äôll ever get anything done again. But here's the good news: there are some handy techniques that can get us back on track faster than you can say ""caffeine boost."" 

**Here are a few of my favorite mental reset techniques:**

- **Walk it Out:** Sometimes all you need is a little fresh air. A quick stroll can clear your mind and get those creative juices flowing. Plus, it‚Äôs a great excuse to step away from your screen!
  
- **Dance Break:** Crank up your favorite song and just‚Ä¶ move. Seriously, put on that jam and dance like no one is watching! It‚Äôs hard to feel unproductive when you‚Äôre busting out your best moves.

- **Mindfulness Moments:** Let‚Äôs be real, we live in a chaotic world. Taking a few minutes to breathe deeply and center yourself can do wonders. Picture this: you inhale positivity, exhale negativity. Ahhh, feel better already, right?

- **Mini-Mission:** Have a small, non-intimidating task waiting for you? Go tackle it! Even if it‚Äôs just organizing your desk or replying to one email, checking something off your list can give you that sweet taste of accomplishment.

- **Change of Scenery:** Switching up your environment can make a massive difference. Move to a different room, hit a coffee shop, or even just rearrange your workspace. A new view might spark new ideas!

- **Journaling Blitz:** I often find writing it out helps. No rules‚Äîjust a stream of consciousness. Write about your slump, your dreams, or even your dinner plans. Sometimes the act of writing can reset your brain.

# Chapter 1

After five years of marriage, Evelyn was finally pregnant.

But she found her marriage certificate was fake!

It turned out her five-year marriage was a lie!

She and Theodore had been childhood sweethearts.

He loved her to death‚Äîor so she thought.

He had chased her for years, planned an elaborate proposal, and showered her with affection after marriage.

So why‚Ä¶ why give her a fake certificate?

Determined to get answers, Evelyn immediately booked a flight to Elvenda, where Theodore was on a business trip.

She needed to confront him and needed to know the truth.

Evelyn arrived at the hotel where Theodore was staying and was just in time to see a wedding taking place.

Elvenda was a unique country, each person could only marry once in their lifetime.

There was no divorce, only widowhood.

She had no intention of staying to watch. She pushed her way through the crowd toward the elevator.

As her eyes flicked past the groom inadvertently, who was surrounded by people, she caught sight of him, and it struck her like lightning!

The man was dressed in a leather jacket and tight pants, wearing high boots and a beret, a red wide belt cinching his waist.

He looked every bit the local man, radiating happiness.

It was none other than her husband of five years‚ÄîTheodore.

If she hadn‚Äôt seen it with her own eyes, she would never have imagined Theodore would dress like that!

‚ÄúCongratulations on the wedding, Theodore!‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to say, Theodore, you‚Äôre impressive. You can throw such grand weddings both at home and abroad!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Theodore, are you really serious about that poor little girl Gianna?‚Äù

Another person asked curiously, ‚ÄúDoes this count as bigamy? After all, didn‚Äôt Theodore already marry Evelyn back home?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou clearly don‚Äôt know the whole story. Theodore never actually registered his marriage with Evelyn back home. He kept it a secret, waiting for Gianna to came of age. Legally, he‚Äôs been single all these five years!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way! That‚Äôs wild. Theodore sure knows how to play the game.‚Äù

Evelyn stood frozen in the crowd, feeling her blood running cold.

She thought she had misheard, but the next words from Theodore hit like a plunge into icy water.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely serious about Gianna. Back then, she risked her life to donate blood and save Evelyn. She was willing to live in Evelyn‚Äôs shadow for years without asking for anything in return. All she wanted was a long-lasting marriage, and I can give that to her,‚Äù Theodore spoke slowly, each word deliberate and measured.

So that was the truth.

Tears welled up in Evelyn‚Äôs eyes without her even realizing it. The fake marriage certificate had been Theodore‚Äôs doing.

Five years ago, Evelyn had been in a car accident. It was Gianna, who had just entered high school, who had rushed her to the hospital and donated blood to save her.

Gianna came from a poor family and had only a sick mother to rely on. As a way of thanking Gianna for saving Evelyn‚Äôs life, Evelyn and Theodore had covered all of Gianna‚Äôs school expenses and even sent her abroad to study and travel.

Theodore had said that because Gianna saved Evelyn, she had saved him too.

He was willing to give everything he could to show his gratitude.

What Evelyn had expected was that Theodore‚Äôs way of showing gratitude also involved raising Gianna to adulthood and marrying her.

What was even more ridiculous was that, over these five years, Evelyn had never noticed. She had no idea when they had become involved.

One of Theodore‚Äôs friends couldn‚Äôt help but ask, ‚ÄúWhat about Evelyn? Aren‚Äôt you worried she‚Äôll find out?‚Äù

Theodore lowered his gaze, quickly tapping his phone screen with his slender fingers. His voice carried an almost imperceptible confidence. ‚ÄúI will always love Evelyn, but she will never find out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou all better keep your mouths shut. Don‚Äôt let anything slip to Evelyn.‚Äù

At that moment, Evelyn‚Äôs phone vibrated.

She looked at the message from Theodore, her heart freezing, a chill spreading through her.

‚ÄúHoney, I miss you. I don‚Äôt want to be away on this business trip. Every second without you feels like torture. I‚Äôll try to come home on our anniversary. Your loving Theodore.‚Äù

Evelyn clutched her phone tightly, raising her gaze to see Theodore moving further away. Pain gripped her chest.

Her vision blurred gradually, and hot tears welled up in her eyes. This wasn‚Äôt her Theodore.

Her Theodore was her childhood sweetheart, the one who had grown up with her, the one who had once climbed through her window to pick up her fallen hairpin and broken his leg while comforting her not to cry.

He was the one who, at eighteen, climbed to the peak of a snow-capped mountain just to confess his love for her, swearing to love her forever and never lie to her.

He was the one, at twenty, who had written her 9,999 love letters and baked a hundred different cakes to propose to her.

He was the one who had planned a grand wedding for them when they were twenty-two. He was the one who, after their marriage, couldn‚Äôt bear to be apart from her, showering her with love day and night...

He wasn‚Äôt this liar in front of her, who could say he loved her while marrying another woman.

Evelyn‚Äôs heart twisted in agony. She bit down on her lip hard, her phone vibrating again with an incoming call from Theodore.

She hesitated for a moment, then answered the phone.

‚ÄúHoney, where are you? Have you eaten yet? Why is it so noisy there?‚Äù

Theodore‚Äôs voice was as gentle as ever, filled with love in every word.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, Theodore?‚Äù Evelyn instinctively tightened her grip on the phone, wondering if Theodore would come clean. She thought if he confessed, she would have a serious talk with him, perhaps even give their relationship another chance.

But Theodore didn‚Äôt hesitate to speak. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a meeting. I missed you so much, I had to step out to call you. Honey, are you out shopping? Buy whatever you like.‚Äù

Evelyn‚Äôs lips suddenly curled into a faint smile, but the light in her eyes died. She fell silent for a few seconds before softly replying, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

Theodore immediately sensed her change in tone, and unease crept into his voice. ‚ÄúHoney, are you upset? If anything‚Äôs wrong, just tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a rush to try on clothes. I‚Äôll hang up now.‚Äù

Evelyn ended the call and turned her gaze toward Gianna not far away, dressed as a local bride, as she slipped into Theodore‚Äôs arms.

‚ÄúHoney, do I look good?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look beautiful. My woman looks good in anything.‚Äù

Theodore said with a gentle smile, wrapping an arm around her waist and pressing a tender kiss to her forehead.

His smile pierced Evelyn‚Äôs heart.

So, his tenderness and indulgence weren‚Äôt just for her. He could share his tenderness and affection that should only belong to her with another woman.

Theodore, how could your heart hold room for two women?

Evelyn fled the hotel in a panic, crouching in an alley, curling up into a ball, allowing the tears to fall freely.

She cried until she nearly fainted, then slowly stood up. A cold determination flashed in her eyes.

She wouldn‚Äôt continue this fake marriage of five years.

She didn‚Äôt want Theodore anymore, either!

Since they were already legally married, she would let them be together.

In two weeks, it would be her parents‚Äô death anniversary. After honoring them, she would leave. She would disappear completely from Theodore‚Äôs world.

Evelyn took a cab to the airport and booked the earliest flight home.

The first thing she did upon returning was to schedule an appointment for an abortion.

# Chapter 2

‚ÄúMs. Bennett, your abdomen was severely injured in the car accident. The fact that you're pregnant is a miracle. If you decide to terminate the pregnancy, it might be very difficult for you to conceive again in the future.‚Äù The doctor looked at Evelyn with a troubled expression. ‚ÄúYou should think it over carefully and discuss it with your husband.‚Äù

Evelyn‚Äôs fingers curled slightly, a sharp pain piercing her heart. Theodore had never told her about this.

Whenever the Whitmores and the Bennetts pressured them to have a baby, Theodore would always take the blame, saying he wasn‚Äôt ready to have a child because he wanted to enjoy their life together without the interruption of a baby.

Her eyes brimmed with tears as she thought of how much he cared for her, always trying to protect her from hurt.

But no matter how thoughtful he was, it couldn‚Äôt change the fact that he had lied to her.

‚ÄúThank you, doctor. I‚Äôll think about it,‚Äù Evelyn replied, her voice shaky.

She walked out of the exam room in a daze, but unexpectedly ran into Theodore and Gianna who were already back from abroad in the hallway.

Theodore was carefully supporting Gianna as they walked out of the ultrasound room, his face full of worry. His tender, affectionate gaze was fixed on Gianna‚Äôs face, unwilling to look away for even a moment.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry so much, Theodore. I‚Äôm pregnant, not sick,‚Äù Gianna smiled, her eyes soft. She had been young when she met Theodore, and even now, she still called him ‚ÄúTheodore‚Äù without hesitation.

Theodore smiled back, his joy uncontainable. ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm worried. This is our first child. I have to take good care of you.‚Äù

Evelyn tightly gripped the appointment slip in her hand, her body growing colder with each passing second. It felt as though her heart had shattered, tears welling up in her eyes, but no tears would fall.

It was true, when the pain was unbearable, it was impossible to cry.

Theodore supported Gianna as they stepped into the elevator, and Evelyn watching behind them slowly unfolded the appointment slip in her hand. She turned back to the doctor‚Äôs office and scheduled an abortion for the day after tomorrow.

She refused to let her child be born into a world full of lies. And she didn‚Äôt want her child to be born without a father.

It was as if fate was playing a joke on her. As she walked through the underground parking garage, she saw Theodore and Gianna again. Without thinking, she followed them in her car.

Theodore took Gianna to her revolving restaurant.

Evelyn‚Äôs heart sank. The revolving restaurant had been where Theodore had designed and build for her birthday last year.

He had told her that only she deserved to dine there. But now, he was taking another woman there.

Inside the restaurant, Gianna sat in Evelyn‚Äôs favorite spot, the table in front of her piled with desserts. Not far away, Theodore was pushing a serving cart toward her.

With elegance, he plucked a flower from his chest and handed it to Gianna, underneath it was a diamond necklace. ‚ÄúCongratulations, my little princess. You‚Äôre going to be a mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúTheodore, thank you, I‚Äôm so happy.‚Äù Gianna‚Äôs eyes welled with tears. ‚ÄúYou even cooked for me yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me have just one bite. After that, you can go. I‚Äôve already monopolized you for days. You should go back to Evelyn to keep her company,‚Äù she said, blinking her eyes hard, forcing out a few tears.

Theodore‚Äôs heart ached as he pulled her into his arms. ‚ÄúSilly girl, I‚Äôm not going anywhere today. I‚Äôll stay by your side.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what about Evelyn? Tomorrow is your anniversary with her. If you don‚Äôt go back, she‚Äôll be upset.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already arranged everything. You don‚Äôt need to worry,‚Äù Theodore said, gently touching Gianna‚Äôs hair before fastening the necklace around her neck. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my wife now, and from now on, I‚Äôll make more time for you and our child.‚Äù

From around the corner, Evelyn took a few steps back, her back pressed against the cold wall. The chill seeped through her as her body trembled uncontrollably.

Of course, Gianna was Theodore‚Äôs legitimate wife.

And she was nothing but a fool without a title.

She remembered the first time Theodore brought her to the revolving restaurant, how he had prepared a diamond necklace for her, how he had secretly learned how to cook from a Michelin-starred chef for a month just to make her a meal.

‚ÄúHoney, taste my cooking. From now on, I‚Äôll take care of all your meals.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll love you for the rest of my life, only you.‚Äù He‚Äôd placed the necklace on her, whispering a vow in her ear.

Now, Theodore had transferred all his love and affection to Gianna.

Her chest was tight and painful. Theodore‚Äôs ‚Äúfor the rest of my life‚Äù was too short.

Evelyn quickly turned and fled, her tears streaming down her face as she left the restaurant.

She went to a law firm, asking the lawyer, Asher, to liquidate her assets and return everything related to Theodore to him.

Her parents‚Äô inheritance was enough to last her several lifetimes. She didn‚Äôt lack money. She just wanted to cut ties with Theodore as quickly as possible.

As the evening darkened, she finished her business and drove home.

The empty villa had only a single light left on by the maid. Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed on the sofa, gazing at all the photos of her and Theodore around the house. Her heart felt as if it were being crushed under a heavy stone, each beat sending sharp pain throughout her chest.

She rubbed her forehead, then got up to take down all the framed photos from the wall.

The first photo they had taken together when they were children, her in a pink dress, with Theodore calling her the most beautiful princess.

The photo of their first dance, when he had gently held her waist, telling her she could only dance with him from now on.

Their first date photo, where he spun her around ceaselessly, saying he was the happiest man in the world.



She tore up the photos, one by one, feeding them into the shredder. All the memories between them were reduced to shreds.

For the entire night, she repeated this process, erasing every sweet memory they had shared.

By morning, her arms were numb from her repeated actions, but Theodore had still not returned.

And today was their wedding anniversary.

# Chapter 3

On their anniversary day, Theodore posted a heartfelt message on social media right at midnight, expressing his love and gratitude to Evelyn. Within hours, the post had garnered millions of likes and shares. The city's electronic billboards flashed with a romantic video Theodore had personally edited, showing everyone just how deeply he loved her.

Outside their villa, a large crowd had gathered at some point. They had arranged 1,825 bouquets of roses, which lined the path leading to a massive hollow crystal ring in the center. Inside the ring were the latest clothing and handbags from luxury brands. At the top of it all sat a small music box that repeated Theodore‚Äôs soothing voice.

‚ÄúHoney, happy anniversary. I love you, just like always.‚Äù

Evelyn remained expressionless. She shut the door and buried herself under the blankets, as if none of it concerned her.

A moment later, Theodore called. His voice was filled with guilt. ‚ÄúHoney, something came up with work. I can‚Äôt make it home for our anniversary, but I promise I‚Äôll make it up to you when I get back.‚Äù

Hearing his clumsy excuse, Evelyn suddenly laughed, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. You go ahead with your work.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney, you‚Äôre upset,‚Äù Theodore said, sensing her shift in tone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve prepared lots of surprises for you. I hope you‚Äôll like them. I‚Äôll make it up to you in a few days.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, work comes first. I‚Äôm just not feeling well. I‚Äôm going to rest.‚Äù Evelyn coldly hung up the phone.

She curled up into a ball, fighting to suppress the pain in her heart.

Outside, the celebration continued. Drones arranged by Theodore put on a light show in the sky, forming various shapes to express his love for Evelyn.

Reporters had gathered, eager to interview her, hoping to continue promoting their love story.

Evelyn ignored them, her phone ringing repeatedly.

As she saw Theodore's name on the screen, her vision blurred again. She wanted to pick up the phone and ask him why he had broken his promises, why he had fallen in love with another woman.

But in the end, she just silently turned off the phone and buried her head in the blankets.

Time passed before the blanket was suddenly thrown off. A harsh light flooded the room, stinging Evelyn‚Äôs eyes.

Against the light, she saw Theodore, haggard and pale, hair messy, his eyes filled with worry and regret.

Realizing she was upset, he had rushed back immediately. He‚Äôd called her non-stop, but she hadn‚Äôt answered, and it had terrified him.

When he saw Evelyn, he pulled her into a tight hug, his voice cracking, hoarse. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre at home! Honey, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

Theodore‚Äôs eyes were red, his body shaking uncontrollably. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never leave you alone at home again. When you didn‚Äôt answer my calls, I thought the world was falling apart.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more important than anything. I‚Äôm here now, and we‚Äôre going to spend our anniversary together.‚Äù

Evelyn didn‚Äôt speak. Theodore thought she was still upset, so he kneeled down beside her, trying to appease her. ‚ÄúHoney, promise me you won‚Äôt ignore my calls or shut me out anymore, because I can‚Äôt bear it.‚Äù

His nervousness and fear didn‚Äôt seem fake. He truly loved her, but his love was divided.

‚ÄúYou came back fast,‚Äù Evelyn said, her lips curling slightly. Theodore‚Äôs face shifted slightly, a hint of guilt crossing his features.

‚ÄúHoney, you haven‚Äôt eaten all day, right? Let me take you to the revolving restaurant.‚Äù Theodore changed the topic, gently smoothing the stray hair from her forehead.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go,‚Äù Evelyn shook her head.

Theodore‚Äôs anxiety grew. ‚ÄúThen get some rest, I‚Äôll make you something downstairs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Evelyn gave a cold nod and turned her back to him.

He assumed she was still angry. Taking a deep breath, he left the room.

Minutes later, there was noise coming from downstairs.

Evelyn went down and found Theodore‚Äôs friends in the living room, helping him hang up newly developed photos of the two of them. They had been taken earlier and were being returned to the walls.

When they saw Evelyn, they immediately started defending Theodore.

‚ÄúEvelyn, you scared Theodore half to death! I‚Äôve never seen him this anxious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you get upset again, let us know! We‚Äôll have your back, but just don‚Äôt throw out any more photos and don‚Äôt turn off your phone again. Theodore might die because of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt find Evelyn again, Theodore will lose it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right! He fainted just looking at the empty walls and even started going through the trash.‚Äù



‚ÄúShut up, all of you,‚Äù Theodore growled as he walked out of the kitchen, wearing an apron. His face was full of anger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault. I made my honey sad, and she has every right to punish me.‚Äù

‚ÄúTheodore really spoils Evelyn rotten. He doesn‚Äôt care about his pride in front of Evelyn. Evelyn is so lucky,‚Äù Gianna walked out from the crowd, smiling with envy.

Theodore kept his composure, smiling warmly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my lover and surely I‚Äôll spoil her.‚Äù

Evelyn felt a wave of disgust wash over her. His words were all fake.

But she didn‚Äôt want to expose him.

Evelyn spoke coldly, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to hang the photos. I want to change the color of the walls.‚Äù

Theodore walked over to her, wrapping his arm around her waist. ‚ÄúAlright, no one needs to hang them. We‚Äôll do whatever my Honey says.‚Äù

‚ÄúTheodore‚Äôs totally whipped,‚Äù someone teased, but Theodore didn‚Äôt seem to care.

He helped Evelyn sit down on the sofa and went back to the kitchen to keep working.

Theodore cooked all of Evelyn‚Äôs favorite dishes, but she found the food tasteless.

With one hand, Theodore carefully served her food. With the other, he secretly held Gianna‚Äôs hand under the table, fingers tightly entwined.

Evelyn suddenly felt disinterested. She couldn‚Äôt wait to leave, to escape from Theodore.

After dinner, Theodore didn‚Äôt give Evelyn the chance to refuse. He actively bent down to put on her shoes and socks, lifting her into his arms and carrying her out. His friends laughed behind them.

Even Gianna laughed and teased along, but Evelyn clearly caught the fleeting flash of jealousy and venom in her eyes.

Theodore had arranged a fireworks display on the ocean and hired a band Evelyn loved to perform.

Halfway through the performance, Theodore excused himself to go to the restroom.

Evelyn, feeling an inexplicable impulse, followed him.

# Chapter 4

In the VIP lounge, Gianna threw herself into Theodore‚Äôs arms, tilting up her seductive face to kiss his lips.

‚ÄúTheodore, I missed you so much. Just let me kiss you for a while.‚Äù

Theodore wrapped one arm around her waist, the other pressing against the back of her head, responding with fiery passion. As they kissed passionately, the air grew thick with tension.

After a long while, Gianna pushed him away, cheeks flushed and breathing heavy.

‚ÄúThat's enough. You should go back to Evelyn now.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure to let me go just like this?‚Äù Theodore's eyes shimmered with desire as his fingertip brushed across her swollen red lips.

Gianna lowered her gaze. ‚ÄúI'm not. But I don't want Evelyn to be upset. She‚Äôs even stopped answering your calls because of me. I can wait until you're done with her and come back to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're so understanding, it breaks my heart,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúBut I can't bear to leave you either. Be good and listen to me. Don‚Äôt think about anyone else. Just focus on the pleasure I‚Äôm giving you right now.‚Äù

His kisses trailed down from her lips to her neck and chest. Soft moans of pleasure escaped from Gianna's mouth as her nails dug into Theodore's back.

‚ÄúTheodore... don‚Äôt kiss me there... I can‚Äôt take it,‚Äù she gasped.

‚ÄúYou little temptress,‚Äù he teased, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt this exactly how you like it the most?‚Äù

The room was filled with lustful sounds and heated whispers, an intimate scene that made Evelyn feel like she‚Äôd plunged into an icy abyss.

She bit down on the back of her hand hard, forcing herself not to cry aloud. She had thought her heart couldn‚Äôt possibly break any more than it already had. But seeing it with her own eyes still tore her apart.

Theodore hadn‚Äôt just betrayed her emotionally, he had betrayed her entirely.

A burning churned in her stomach. A wave of nausea surged. She clutched her mouth and ran to the bathroom, vomiting until she was lightheaded. A dull pain radiated from her lower abdomen.

She gently placed a trembling hand over her belly, tears blurring her vision.

Baby, I‚Äôm sorry.

I'm sorry you had to see your father like this. And forgive me I can‚Äôt bring you into this world.

Her face pale, Evelyn staggered out of the bathroom. The deck was lively and festive, but Theodore and Gianna were nowhere to be seen.

By the time the fireworks show ended, the two finally returned one after the other, Theodore walking slightly ahead of Gianna, who wore a satisfied, glowing expression.

Gianna deliberately sat beside Evelyn and opened a velvet jewelry box with a cheerful smile.

‚ÄúEvelyn, this is for you. I made it myself,‚Äù she said sweetly. ‚ÄúThank you and Theodore for taking such good care of me. I didn‚Äôt save you five years ago, I think you two saved me. I wish your marriage everlasting and you‚Äôre always happy.‚Äù

Inside the box was a bright green bracelet, so vibrant it almost hurt to look at.

Evelyn stared at it blankly, then forced a smile. ‚ÄúKeep it for yourself. I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

Gianna‚Äôs hand trembled, her eyes reddening instantly. She looked instinctively at Theodore.

But Theodore seemingly ignored her silent plea. His gentle gaze remained fixed on Evelyn, as if she were the only one he saw.

‚ÄúIf my honey doesn‚Äôt like it, then take it back,‚Äù he said.

Gianna bit her lip and quietly put the gift away, feeling hurt. ‚ÄúThen may I at least propose a toast to Evelyn? I hope she‚Äôll always be happy.‚Äù

Evelyn didn‚Äôt refuse this time. She accepted the drink and took a sip.

Gianna's smile returned. She turned and walked away, but in that brief moment, her eyes glinted with something cruel and sinister.

She tripped on a chair and cried out as she fell, clutching her abdomen in pain.

‚ÄúIt hurts...‚Äù

Everyone around her panicked. Someone nearby quickly picked her up. When they saw the red stains blooming on her dress, they were stunned and gasped.

All eyes turned to Theodore quickly. Evelyn instinctively looked at him too.

But Theodore remained calm. When he met Evelyn‚Äôs gaze, he smiled gently and took her hand.

‚ÄúTake her to the hospital,"" he said nonchalantly. ""I'm going to stay with my honey and enjoy the rest of the show.‚Äù

People hurried to escort Gianna off the yacht. Theodore continued to hold Evelyn‚Äôs hand as if nothing had happened, letting the music performed by the band wash over them.

If she hadn‚Äôt already discovered their real relationship, she might have been fooled by his performance.

Evelyn's heart grew colder. The pain in her abdomen worsened.

Just as she was about to ask to go home, Theodore's phone rang.

‚ÄúMr. Whitmore, you rushed home earlier today, and we still haven‚Äôt finalized that contract. Can you come to the office now?‚Äù his assistant‚Äôs anxious voice came through the phone.

Theodore frowned, hesitating for a few seconds before hanging up. When he looked at Evelyn again, there was a hint of guilt in his eyes.

‚ÄúHoney, I need to go to the office for a bit. Just wait here, okay? I‚Äôll send the driver to pick you up.‚Äù

Evelyn gave a cold smile. ‚ÄúSure, go ahead.‚Äù

He stood up and leaned in to kiss her forehead, but she turned away, pretending to cough.

Theodore didn‚Äôt press it and quickly left.

Evelyn knew he had gone to the hospital.

Strangely, the pain in her heart began to fade.

She waited for half an hour, but the driver never showed.

A wave of intense cramping twisted her stomach. She hunched over, glancing at the broken glass on the floor, the one that had held her drink.

A horrifying thought struck her.

Gianna had drugged the drink.

Clutching her abdomen, Evelyn forced herself to her feet and picked up a shard with liquid residue, carefully wrapping it to keep as evidence.

The pain grew worse, spreading from her stomach to her lower belly. She clearly felt a force tearing apart her belly and something hot trickling down her legs.

She instinctively tried calling Theodore, but he didn‚Äôt answer.

She tried the driver, but there was also no response.

With the last ounce of her strength, Evelyn dialed for an ambulance...

# Chapter 5

When Evelyn woke up again, she was in the hospital. For a moment, she felt dazed.

She touched her flat abdomen, and her heart clenched painfully, she had lost the baby.

‚ÄúMs. Bennett, where is your family? You still need to pay the remaining fees. You‚Äôve been poisoned with heavy metals and need to cooperate with the police investigation. And sorry, you‚Äôve lost your child.‚Äù The nurse, seeing that she had woken up, began asking her about her condition.

Evelyn‚Äôs fingers trembled as she reached for her phone and called Theodore, but the screen showed that his phone was off.

She forced a bitter smile. After he left last night, he hadn‚Äôt answered her calls, nor had he tried to reach out.

He had once said he would be there for her the moment she needed him.

Now, he was ignoring her calls to be with Gianna.

‚ÄúI have no family. I‚Äôll pay for it myself,‚Äù Evelyn replied weakly.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get out of bed. I‚Äôll take care of the payments. You rest,‚Äù the nurse kindly insisted, trying to stop Evelyn from moving.

As the nurse made her notes and left the room, she couldn‚Äôt help but mutter, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both women, yet their life couldn‚Äôt be more different. There‚Äôs a woman next door, just a threatened miscarriage, and her husband‚Äôs so frantic he booked the entire VIP floor, flying in the top medical team from around the world overnight to try and save the pregnancy.‚Äù

The nurse glanced back at Evelyn. ‚ÄúThis poor woman, poisoned and miscarrying, and she doesn‚Äôt even have any family.‚Äù

Evelyn heard the nurse‚Äôs words, knowing she was referring to Theodore and Gianna. Her heart felt empty, and there was no longer any emotional response.

Evelyn transferred herself into a VIP room, and while hospitalized, she arranged for tests on the glass fragments to check for toxins, determined to find out who had poisoned her.

Theodore didn‚Äôt contact her even after she was discharged.

She went straight to the villa of her family, took the ring her mother had left her, and locked the precious heirlooms in a permanent safety deposit box.

She decided to sell the villa and never return.

Then, she went to the state court to change her name, because she was going to make sure Theodore would never find her again.

Back at home, she saw Gianna lounging on the couch, wrapped in her blanket, snacking while watching a drama.

Evelyn furrowed her brows. Before she could speak, Gianna stood up from the couch.

‚ÄúEvelyn, you‚Äôre back. Have you eaten? Theodore went to buy a cake. Do you want a chocolate one?‚Äù Gianna smiled, her eyes gleaming with a sense of pride she couldn‚Äôt hide.

‚ÄúWho gave you the right to touch my things?‚Äù Evelyn‚Äôs face darkened as she stared at the disorganized coffee table, feeling a rush of frustration.

She had always hated people touching her things, even more so when things were disorganized in her own house.

Theodore knew her habits. He rarely brought anyone home, and if he did, he made sure everything was cleaned and sanitized in time.

Now, he was letting Gianna lie on her spot, using her blanket, eating her snacks.

‚ÄúEvelyn, are you angry? I‚Äôll give it back to you.‚Äù Gianna casually poured the chips onto herself, raising an eyebrow, ‚ÄúPick it up.‚Äù

Evelyn froze, about to speak, but Gianna quickly knelt down to clean up the mess.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Evelyn. I was so hungry I almost fainted, so I ate your snacks. Don‚Äôt be mad, I‚Äôll clean it up right now.‚Äù Gianna‚Äôs eyes were red, tears barely held back.

‚ÄúHoney, what‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù

Gianna‚Äôs sudden change of attitude caught Evelyn off guard. It wasn‚Äôt until she heard Theodore‚Äôs voice behind her that she finally understood everything.

Evelyn turned just in time to see him looking at Gianna on the floor, clearly catching his eyes flashing with a brief hint of concern.

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have touched her things without asking.‚Äù Gianna‚Äôs voice trembled as she lowered her head.

‚ÄúYeah, my honey doesn‚Äôt like people touching her things. What‚Äôs going on here? Why‚Äôs the living room such a mess?‚Äù Theodore frowned, handing Gianna the cake. ‚ÄúTake the cake and go back. Don‚Äôt come to my house again.‚Äù

Gianna paused, staring at the cake in her hand, before slowly standing up to take it.

But in the very next second, Gianna stood up and, as if she lost her balance, stumbled straight into Evelyn. Caught off guard, Evelyn staggered backward with her.

In a flash, Theodore stepped forward and caught Gianna in his arms.

Evelyn near Gianna was knocked backward, her head crashing into the shoe rack with a sickening thud. Blood started pouring from the back of her head instantly, and a wave of dizziness overwhelmed her. The last thing she saw was Theodore holding Gianna tightly in his arms.

# Chapter 6

Evelyn had slept for a long time. When she groggily woke up because her mouth dried with thirst, the entire room was dark.

Struggling to gather the strength to sit up, she instinctively reached for the bedside table, where Theodore would always leave a glass of warm water for her every night. But tonight, it was empty.

A hollow feeling filled her chest, and she gave a bitter, self-deprecating smile. After Gianna got pregnant, no matter how hard Theodore tried to pretend, he wouldn‚Äôt go back to loving her the way he once loved Evelyn.

She got up and went downstairs, but as she passed by the guest room, she heard Theodore‚Äôs voice. She instinctively paused.

‚ÄúIt was my fault Evelyn got hurt. I shouldn‚Äôt have been so reckless,‚Äù Gianna‚Äôs voice trembled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pregnant. You can‚Äôt starve yourself. Evelyn is overreacting. I spoiled her too much. Don‚Äôt cry anymore, or I‚Äôll be heartbroken,‚Äù Theodore said, holding her, and gently patting her head. ""You‚Äôve gotten more and more emotional.""

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that,‚Äù Gianna pouted coquettishly, her sultry face tinged with grievance, making her all the more alluring.

Theodore's Adam's apple bobbed as he averted his gaze. The passion on the yacht had been too much, nearly causing Gianna to miscarry. Now, he was too afraid to act recklessly again.

‚ÄúTheodore, do you want to do it? It‚Äôs a pity Evelyn got hurt; otherwise, she wouldn‚Äôt be able to satisfy you,‚Äù Gianna teased.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not as tempting as you even if she didn‚Äôt get hurt. You little vixen, I can hold back and wait. Once the baby is stable, I won‚Äôt spare you,‚Äù Theodore smiled wickedly.

‚ÄúI can help you, Theodore,‚Äù Gianna said, her voice sweet, as she slid down, kneeling between his legs.

Her seductive face and pure-sounding voice were in stark contrast, and with her actions, Theodore couldn‚Äôt help but groan.

‚ÄúDamn, you‚Äôre amazing, you little slut.‚Äù



Seeing this scene again, Evelyn‚Äôs heart didn‚Äôt stir at all. She numbly continued to walk downstairs to get some water.

Perhaps it was due to the head injury, but she had slept unusually deeply. It wasn‚Äôt until the next evening that she woke up.

‚ÄúHoney, I wanted to save you, but you collapsed too quickly. I couldn‚Äôt catch you...‚Äù Theodore hurriedly explained when he saw her awake, his eyes flickering with unease.

Evelyn looked at him, too tired to call out his lies. She simply asked, ‚ÄúWhere is Gianna?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should blame me if you want to blame someone. Gianna‚Äôs just a little girl and she is too reckless. But she didn‚Äôt mean to bump into you. She almost got hurt herself,‚Äù Theodore explained on Gianna‚Äôs behalf.

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Evelyn replied, her tone calm, with no trace of emotion. ‚ÄúTomorrow is my parents‚Äô death anniversary. Will you come with me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Theodore said, relieved to see Evelyn wasn‚Äôt angry, but then his gaze lingered on her.

He couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that she had changed. There seemed to be less love in her eyes when she looked at him.

Theodore wanted to ask her, but Evelyn had already closed her eyes.

She spent the entire night in a haze, almost as if she were still sleeping. Theodore tried talking to her several times, but she didn‚Äôt respond.

The next day, on the anniversary of her parents‚Äô passing, Evelyn woke up early, washed up, and changed into a black casual outfit. She got into Theodore‚Äôs car, ready to leave.

Theodore thoughtfully prepared breakfast for her, along with a bouquet of chrysanthemums. Seeing her face pale, he felt a pang of sympathy, thinking she was upset. He tried to engage her in conversation along the way.

Evelyn remained indifferent, hardly responding to him.

When they arrived at the cemetery, Theodore received a phone call. His expression shifted to one of concern, and he abruptly slammed on the brakes, stopping by the side of the road.

Evelyn wasn‚Äôt expecting it and was thrown forward, the seatbelt cutting into her shoulder, leaving a red mark. She couldn‚Äôt help but ask, ""What happened?""

‚ÄúHoney, there‚Äôs an urgent matter at the company. I need to handle it,‚Äù Theodore said, his face pale with anxiety and worry written over his eyes. ‚ÄúGo ahead and pay respects to your parents. I‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù

Evelyn nodded understandingly, opening the door, stepping out of the car. Before she could even steady herself, Theodore rushed off, nearly pulling her down with the force of his departure.

As she watched the dust kicked up by his car tires, Evelyn smiled faintly. Theodore seemed to have forgotten that his phone was connected to Bluetooth. She clearly saw the caller ID flashing with Gianna‚Äôs name: ‚ÄúGianna Babe.‚Äù

Gianna was hurt and called Theodore, crying for his attention. Without hesitation, Theodore decided to leave her to go see Gianna.

But Evelyn didn‚Äôt care anymore.

She had long since stopped loving Theodore, and even the resentment she once held seemed to have faded.

- **Applause (uTest)**

I swear, the only thing crazier than all these apps paying is how few people talk about them. Like, WHY didn‚Äôt anyone tell me sooner? Your lazy scrolling = get paid to scroll?! Just‚Ä¶ what??

TLDR:

In a world that increasingly celebrates individuality and passion, accessories have become more than mere fashion statements. They are personal emblems‚Äîexpressions of who we are, what we love, and what brings us joy. For pet lovers, especially those with a deep affection for cats, this means embracing wearable art that reflects their feline devotion. Enter cat-themed necklaces and earrings: stylish, expressive, and surprisingly versatile. These accessories are more than just cute trinkets‚Äîthey are essential symbols of identity, conversation starters, and tokens of emotional connection.

# A Symbol of Feline Love

At the heart of every cat necklace or pair of earrings is love‚Äîpure, unfiltered love for our furry companions. Cats are known for their elegance, mystery, and fiercely independent spirit. By wearing a necklace or earrings featuring a cat, pet lovers keep a part of that spirit close to their heart. For many, these accessories are more than decorative; they symbolize a beloved pet or a cherished memory.

Whether it‚Äôs a delicate silhouette of a sleeping kitten on a pendant or whimsical cat-shaped studs, each piece resonates with personal meaning. It‚Äôs a way for cat lovers to express their bond with their pets when they‚Äôre at work, out with friends, or even traveling‚Äîtimes when their actual cats aren‚Äôt by their side.

# Stylish and Versatile

One of the reasons cat-themed jewelry has become so popular is its stylish adaptability. Today‚Äôs designers offer pieces that range from minimalist and elegant to bold and playful. Whether you prefer sterling silver, gold-plated designs, or even bejeweled versions, there's something for every aesthetic.

A subtle cat-earring or a fine gold chain with a tiny cat pendant can be the perfect addition to a business-casual outfit, providing a touch of personality without overwhelming the look. On the other hand, statement earrings shaped like lounging felines or geometric interpretations of cats can add a unique flair to an evening outfit.

This versatility makes cat jewelry suitable for all kinds of wearers‚Äînot just the loud and proud cat moms, but also those who enjoy more understated or symbolic styles. It's the kind of accessory that fits into every wardrobe, season, and occasion.

# Emotional Comfort and Connection

For many pet lovers, wearing cat jewelry brings emotional comfort. It serves as a reminder of their feline friend, providing a sense of closeness even when they‚Äôre physically apart. For those who have lost a beloved pet, these accessories can act as touching memorials, keeping the memory of their cat alive.

Jewelry, after all, is often worn as a symbol‚Äîof love, grief, joy, or commitment. A [**cute cat necklace**](https://mymarket12.com/product/cute-cat-necklace/) given as a gift can symbolize a shared love of animals, a personal milestone (like adopting a new kitten), or simply a gesture of friendship and understanding. Wearing such a piece can be deeply comforting, like carrying a piece of your pet‚Äôs spirit wherever you go.

# A Conversation Starter

Cat lovers are a passionate community, and nothing starts a conversation faster than a shared interest. Wearing a cat necklace or a quirky pair of cat-shaped earrings can spark chats in elevators, coffee shops, or offices. ‚ÄúI love your earrings‚Äîare you a cat person too?‚Äù can lead to stories about mischievous kittens, rescue cats, and the joys of pet ownership.

These accessories help foster a sense of community. They subtly signal to others that you‚Äôre part of the feline-loving crowd‚Äîa tribe that understands the joy of a soft purr, the comedy of a cat chase, and the quiet companionship of a curled-up tabby on a rainy afternoon.

# Celebrating Feline Aesthetics

Cats are natural muses. Their fluid movements, striking eyes, and elegant forms have inspired artists and designers for centuries. This aesthetic appeal translates beautifully into jewelry. A sleek silver silhouette of a cat in mid-stretch, a minimalist outline of a cat‚Äôs curled tail, or a gemstone pendant shaped like a cat‚Äôs eye‚Äîall evoke the natural beauty and mystery of felines.

Wearing such pieces isn‚Äôt just about showing off your love for your pet; it‚Äôs about appreciating the visual poetry of cats. It‚Äôs about celebrating their grace, their charm, and their undeniable style.

# Sustainable and Ethical Choices

The rise of conscious consumerism has also touched the world of accessories. Many independent artists and eco-friendly brands now produce cat-themed jewelry using recycled materials, ethically sourced metals, or cruelty-free manufacturing processes. This allows cat lovers to extend their compassion beyond their pets, making choices that are kind to animals, the environment, and the people who make the products.

Supporting small businesses or artisans who share your values adds another layer of meaning to your purchase. Not only are you wearing a symbol of your love for cats, but you‚Äôre also contributing to a more ethical and sustainable world‚Äîsomething any animal lover can be proud of.

# Gift Ideas for Pet Lovers

Cat jewelry also makes the perfect gift. Whether it‚Äôs a birthday, an adoption anniversary, a holiday, or just a token of appreciation, a well-chosen cat necklace or pair of [**cute cat earrings**](https://mymarket12.com/product/cute-cat-earrings/) can be incredibly thoughtful. Personalized options‚Äîsuch as pendants engraved with a pet‚Äôs name, birthstone charms, or photo lockets‚Äîadd a custom touch that makes the gift even more special.

For new cat owners, it can be a celebration of a growing bond. For long-time feline fans, it‚Äôs a way to acknowledge their lifelong love. And for someone grieving the loss of a pet, it can serve as a quiet, heartfelt tribute.

# Where to Find the Perfect Piece

Thanks to the internet, finding cat-themed jewelry has never been easier. At Market12, you'll discover a curated collection of unique, high-quality jewelry designed to last‚Äîperfect for daily wear or special occasions. Crafted with care and attention to detail, our pieces reflect a range of styles, from vintage-inspired to modern minimalist and bold statement designs. We also offer customization options, so you can create a piece that truly speaks to your personality and love for your feline friend.

# Final Thoughts

Cute Cat necklaces and earrings aren‚Äôt just accessories‚Äîthey‚Äôre small declarations of love, style, and identity. For pet lovers, they offer a beautiful and personal way to stay connected to what matters most. Whether you‚Äôre showing off your passion, remembering a pet, or just enjoying the elegant charm of feline-inspired design, these pieces have a unique power to comfort, connect, and captivate.

In short, if you're a cat lover‚Äîor shopping for one‚Äîa cat necklace or pair of earrings isn‚Äôt just a perfect accessory. It's an essential one.

It was drowning ‚Äî but not in the lucrative, champagne-fizz way. No, I was drowning in what I call *administrative theatre*: moving data from one spreadsheet to another, composing follow-up emails I could have written in my sleep, shuffling meetings around like some sort of over-paid calendar butler.

It wasn‚Äôt *death by a thousand cuts*. It was death by a thousand *self-inflicted* paper cuts.

**Here‚Äôs the truth most leaders are too dignified to admit:**

You don‚Äôt lose your week to big disasters with their own Hollywood theme music. You lose it to four-minute fiddly tasks ‚Äî done 300 times.

And here‚Äôs the twist: I didn‚Äôt hire more people, drink more coffee, or get ‚Äúdisciplined.‚Äù I simply *removed* those tasks from my reality using three small, clever automations.

**Automation One: Client Reports (4 Hours ‚Üí 20 Minutes)**

Before: Every week I would enter a kind of digital triathlon ‚Äî analytics ‚Üí CRM ‚Üí project tool ‚Äî desperately collecting data, reformatting it, and emailing it in a ‚Äúclient-friendly‚Äù format.

After: I taught the machines to do it. Every Friday at 5 PM, the system pulls the numbers, drops them into my template, exports a PDF, and emails the client. Setup took under three hours. Now it saves me the equivalent of *two full working days* every month.

**Automation Two: Cross-Platform Data Sync (5 Hours ‚Üí 0)**

Before: A new lead arrived. I became a human API ‚Äî copy-paste, copy-paste ‚Äî CRM, spreadsheet, Slack.

After: Now a single input sets off a Rube Goldberg machine of updates and notifications. Took an afternoon to build. Saves me around *three working weeks a year*.

**Automation Three: Payment Follow-Up (4 Hours ‚Üí 45 Minutes)**

Before: I was half-entrepreneur, half-polite-debt-collector.

After: Invoices trigger a polite-but-progressively-firmer sequence of reminders, escalating until payment arrives. My cash flow improved. My stress vanished. And I‚Äôve stopped waking up at 3 a.m. wondering who owes me money.

**In six months:**

298 hours recovered

$56,400 in billable time freed

$165/month in tool costs

ROI so absurdly high it should be illegal

The real gain? Mental bandwidth. That rare, intoxicating state where you can think about *opportunities* rather than ‚Äúwho needs chasing this morning.‚Äù

**Hard truths for would-be automators:**

* Automate outcomes, not tasks
* Start with one bottleneck
* Keep human checkpoints (automation is a scalpel, not a chainsaw)

Your job as a founder is not to be busy. Your job is to be *multiplied*. The right automations don‚Äôt just save time ‚Äî they give you a second, better-rested version of yourself‚Ä¶ minus the scandal of actual cloning.

Things like wanting to step in and pay for a hot woman‚Äôs coffee, covering her gas at the station, carrying her shopping bags through the mall, or helping her with something without expecting anything in return.
For dommes, how would you honestly feel if something like that happened in real life? Imagine you‚Äôre a hot woman at a caf√© and a man politely offers to pay for your order. Or you‚Äôre out at a nice restaurant, and a stranger discreetly covers your dinner bill. Maybe you‚Äôre walking through a store and someone politely asks if they can pay for something you like, whether it‚Äôs a piece of clothing, a perfume, or even something for your home.
What about seeing you at the grocery store and quietly paying for your cart without making a big scene? Or noticing you browsing in a boutique and offering to buy the item you were looking at, purely because they think you deserve it? Even smaller gestures, like paying for your parking, upgrading your seat on a flight, or sending over a dessert at a restaurant, can feel like little real world moments of Findom energy.
Do you think it‚Äôs worth normalizing these acts so they‚Äôre seen as empowering, flattering, and respectful rather than awkward or suspicious? Could this help more men feel confident in embracing their submissive side and treating hot women like royalty in everyday life, not just in private or online?
I‚Äôd love to hear from dommes about how you‚Äôd personally react in these situations and whether you think society should make these gestures more common.",0,1754995217.0,paypigsupportgroup,4,0.4,False

About me:

* 30 years old, down to earth and sarcastic by default, with a soft spot for dad jokes (sorry in advance).
* My hobbies include stepping on LEGO in the dark, trying to cook like I‚Äôm on a cooking show, and pretending I understand how the school app works.
* I‚Äôm emotionally available, baggage-claimed, and just looking to connect. Whether it‚Äôs a witty exchange, flirty chats, or something that grows into more.

About you:

* Someone who‚Äôs open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn‚Äôt mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.
* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo‚Äôs asleep.

Not looking to rush anything. Just good convo, mutual vibes, and maybe some playful banter to break the ice.

I've been studying at the beginner level for a few months now with Duo and Coffee Break Gaelic. I discovered Dot√†man while listening to BBC Radio nan G√†idheal a few weeks ago. I was driving my kids to pre-school and they loved it and demanded more. It's more or less been the soundtrack of our drives since then. 

I'm picking up quite a few of the words but it sure would be handy to have the lyrics. I haven't been able to find them online (except for Einsean, Tractar agus Bhan). Does anyone have a resource they can point to with the lyrics for the songs from the Dot√†man cassette? 

I've been listening to it here:

https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=LTcogoPNmMM&si=ngzvHvXmT7NaEm50

Here‚Äôs the song list:

1. Einsean, Tractar Agus Bhan
2. Dorch Air An Oidhche
3. Uisg' Agus Siabann
4. Tuill
5. Fuachd
6. Gnog, Gnog Aig An Doras
7. Aig A' Chidhe
8. Bocsaichean Beaga, Beaga
9. G√†rradh Iain Eardsaidh
10. Oran A' F√≤n
11. Gealach Ur Is Rionnagan
12. Anns A' Chidsin
13. Brig, Brag Air An Uinneig
14. 'S Toigh Leam Mo Bhiadh
15. Preusantan
16. Rudan Fada

Or if any fluent speakers are willing to do a service for the good of the language and write them down... I know of at least two kids who would benefit greatly from having access to the lyrics!

Right now I‚Äôm doing a **16/8** schedule, with the goal of moving into **18/6** next month.

Currently, I have **lunch around 1-2 PM** and **dinner around 8-9 PM**. The issue is that I‚Äôve always loved breakfast (my favorite meal of the day lol) and skipping it has been the hardest part so far. I‚Äôve read that working on an empty stomach can improve focus - and I‚Äôve noticed this to a certain extent - but I haven‚Äôt *really* felt the full effects yet.

However, I can‚Äôt really sacrifice lunch or dinner to keep breakfast. If I gave up dinner and had breakfast at, say, 10 AM, I‚Äôd have to stop eating by around 4 PM and I know I‚Äôd have trouble sleeping on an empty stomach. On the other hand, having breakfast and dinner but skipping lunch feels absurd, because I rely on that midday meal for the ‚Äúenergy kick‚Äù that gets me through the afternoon.

Anyway: in the mornings, I‚Äôm mostly drinking water and coffee, but I still don‚Äôt feel 100% comfortable. 

My questions are:

* Any recommendations on what I could have in the morning that **won‚Äôt break my fast**? Any tricks to make the mornings easier?
* Does this discomfort fade with time?
* When should I expect to hit that ‚Äúfull focus‚Äù work potential in the mornings w/ my empty stomach?

The cleverest businesses have realised something simple. AI agents are not here to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù staff ‚Äî they are here to quietly do all the boring, repetitive, sleep-inducing work your team hates so your humans can finally do the stuff that actually moves the needle.

The best part? They work while you sleep. They do not get bored. They do not call in sick. And they never forget a lead, an invoice, or a follow-up. They also cost less than your weekly coffee bill in per-hour terms.

Here are the five AI workhorses worth hiring immediately.

**1. The Customer Service Agent**

Think of it as the most unflappable employee you will ever have. Handles 80% of inquiries instantly, at any hour, with a smile baked into its syntax.  
It pulls up order history in milliseconds, never gets grumpy during the night shift, and can politely deal with the same question a thousand times without feeling dead inside.

ROI hint: Most companies see payback inside two months because this ‚Äúemployee‚Äù will never insist on a bigger desk or leave for a competitor.

2. The Sales Follow-Up Agent

Humans are terrible at follow-up. We get distracted. We forget. We prioritise the wrong leads.  
This AI won‚Äôt. It pings, emails, and nurtures every prospect on perfect timing. It works a lead for six to twelve months with the diplomacy of a ma√Ætre d‚Äô and the persistence of a debt collector.  
The result? More deals closed, fewer leaks in the sales funnel, and warm leads handed to your closers rather than the cold ones you secretly dread calling.

3. The Appointment Scheduling Agent

Most meetings die in the scheduling stage ‚Äî murdered by email ping-pong or unanswered calls.  
This AI books meetings directly from chat, text, or email. It syncs with calendars and even remembers to send reminders so your prospect actually turns up.  
It will book someone at 8pm on a Sunday while your competitor is watching Netflix.

**4. The Lead Qualification Agent**

Your salespeople‚Äôs biggest time-waster? Talking to people who can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt buy.  
This agent politely asks the right questions up front, scores the lead, and routes the serious ones to the humans. The rest get put into nurturing sequences until they are ready.  
It learns who says yes and updates its qualifying criteria, so over time, your pipeline gets hotter without you lifting a finger.

**5. The Data Entry Agent**

Quite literally your robot intern. It reads invoices, forms, even dodgy scanned PDFs. It extracts the useful stuff and puts it in the right place without typos or sighs.  
If a human did it, they would spend 80% of their day clicking between tabs. This AI does it in seconds, perfectly. Over the year, that adds up to hundreds of human hours freed for work that actually matters.

**Why These Agents Pay for Themselves**

Operating costs drop by up to 60%.  
Response times collapse from hours to seconds.  
Lead conversion jumps 35-57%.  
Staff get back multiple hours a day for higher-value work.  
And yes, revenues grow ‚Äî not because of ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù alone, but because your business can suddenly handle more without breaking.

**How to Implement Without Tears**

Start with one agent on your worst bottleneck.  
Train your team to oversee, not micromanage.  
Integrate with your existing software via API and avoid overcomplicating things.  
Once it‚Äôs running well, you‚Äôll start looking for the next job you can hand over, and eventually you will wonder why you ever paid people to manually copy-and-paste numbers between spreadsheets.",1,1754994557.0,EasyBizWins,0,1.0,False

1mo4zzm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mo4zzm,What does this rash indicate?,"I‚Äôve had this rash on my chest and side for several years. It never goes away fully but sometimes is more visible than others. Also sometimes I get really itchy on my back and legs. Separately my nasal passages closes up whenever I am around cooking fumes or air pollution e.g kitchen, restaurant, coffee shop etc. This all kicked off when I got Covid 5 years ago. My GP has no answers other than antihistamines and Ryaltris nasal spray ( neither help much) Ironically nasal strips and vicks vaporub seem to work better. Eating processsed food or food high in dairy content make the rash and itching worse. I am coeliac for 40 years which hasn‚Äôt been an issue - I stick strictly to the gluten free diet.  I also have swollen fingers (which may not be related). Any suggestions would be appreciated",1,1754994413.0,AskDoctorSmeeee,0,1.0,False
