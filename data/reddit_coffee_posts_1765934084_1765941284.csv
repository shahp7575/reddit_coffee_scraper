When I was expecting my second baby during covid, my husband by choice chose not to work. Prior to this, He was working long hours and travelled for work and eventually I assume he got burnt out and just couldn't do it anymore. Over the years, when he worked this job I would ask him to cut hours so he could spend some time with me and our first baby . He had a lot of debt and eventually paid that off but continued to work crazy, long hours. So for example, if we are going out as a family and he gets a call, we would turn back. He would drop us home and head to work.

I complained quite a bit to him about spending time together but he always explained he was doing it for us. I also told him that once he paid off his debt , lets be careful with the money as our family is growing. I also worked part time and I was easily able to take care of mine and my daughter's needs Alhamdulillah fairly well. Any money he gave I would save and eventually he would slowly take it back . I once remember him bragging to me that he was getting a raise and he made over 13K a month and I asked him awkwardly lol (since a husbands job is to provide) if I can have $500 a month. I am not a big spender but from what I understood he had a habit of getting into debt so I was planning on saving that money for a down payment on a home (which he promised we were going to buy). He however just laughed in my face and asked ""If I had been thinking about that for a while..."" I let it go. The debt was not from me. I noticed in their family, you could never really see where the money was going. No nice clothes or anything valuable in our apartment and was always stingy when it came to eating out. We would share a cup of coffee...until I lost it and said enough is enough lol

I never really knew how much he was making because I didn't have access to his accounts. He would show me any pending loans he had to pay off. He knew exactly how much I had and was pretty honest about my savings (which I regret a lot)

During my second pregnancy, he didn't work for a year and half (so again, he stacked up alot of debt. I was working to make my hours so I could receive EI during my maternity leave. In that time we also moved into our brand new home. I helped with half the down payment, took out line of credit for closing costs and helped financed our appliances for our home. I did tell my husband that the money I saved I wanted to use for furniture . He also would tell me strange things like how he borrowed money from his brother and father . I know that was a lie but he kept saying it to me before we entered our home. I ignored it.

When we moved into the home, I would tell my husband that we bought a home together and it's important that he goes to work so that we do not lose it. We have a family to raise . I look back to this and I don't understand why I had to convince this grown man to be responsible for us . I felt like I was carrying a lot on my shoulders and I had a very difficult pregnancy and post partum depression. I was told that there was a chance my son would be born with a genetic defect and because my husband was so unsupportive I would always be thinking ""How am I going to do this?"" This man is so irresponsible. Alhamdulillah, my son was born normal and healthy. I will always be grateful for this blessing. He is four years old now.

I was always asking my husband what he planned on doing in terms of work and in that time frame I also noticed he was becoming irritated with me. This was unusual behaviour and he would openly joke about getting a second wife. I noticed he would tell me he hated me and then apologize because he felt bad. At the time, I kept thinking I was the problem. I was very emotional and upset with him because I not only financially tried to make life easy for him but also was dealing with his disrespectful family members who were constantly causing issues. I felt like he didn't appreciate my efforts one bit because he was not doing his share in our marriage which was providing for us. I was frustrated because I felt I was doing everything.

I noticed he was also saying a name out loud in his sleep and I also heard it a few times ..him thinking out loud I guess. It was a nickname. One day, I saw him open his Instagram and I saw the name I heard him say. I also found the girl's picture and asked if this is that girl that he liked. He said ""yes"". I rolled my eyes and let it go.

YEars later, when he was away, I snooped through his computer and I found messages between him and that woman. I was shocked because I thought to myself I didn't even know this man could be this romantic. He was flirting lol. Meanwhile I get silent treatments when his mother, father , sisters, brothers are not happy with me. No affection, no spending time with me. I also came up in their conversation and she asked ""How is your wife?"". He said , ""She's nice"". That's it . His messages were from the time my son was 6 months old and I needed him to be a supportive, kind partner. This also makes sense why he was so annoyed with me because he was thinking about another woman.

When I told My therapist, she said ""What consequences did he get?"". I yelled at him when he came home and he said he knows he was wrong and was hoping to keep both of us. Delusional. He also said he just wasn't happy with me and didn't feel anything. I remember thinking to myself I should've picked up my kids and left before he came home and let him be scared. Consequence where he was going to lose me --that's what I should've done.

To this day I haven't gotten over it. Occasionally it'll come up and he will say to me ""That's not cheating"". I remember saying to him, I want that kind of attention for myself ..the kind you gave her. He dismissively said to me, he's never seen his parents be lovey dovey with each other. Unfortunately, he did see his dad repeatedly cheat on his mom. His brother has 4 kids and he was seen on a dating website by someone I know.

I get nervous about my babies. I pray they don't turn out to be like this.

1polq4p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1polq4p,Stanly Ranch Review,"**Overall Impression**

Stanly Ranch is an ambitious Napa Valley resort that’s hit its stride. The property feels warm, intentional, and quietly luxurious, a young resort (opened 2022) that’s figured out what it wants to be. Recent leadership under new GM Tom Donovan, who previously turned around Wildflower Farms, shows in the details: sharper service, more cohesive programming, confident execution. This is a well-designed resort that’s grown into itself.

**Location and Setting**

The resort sits on roughly 700 acres at the southern end of Napa Valley in Carneros AVA. The setting is peaceful and low-slung with a working-ranch feel.

The southern location is an asset for the right traveler. You’re an easy hour and a half from San Francisco or Oakland, well-positioned for Carneros wineries, and removed from the up-valley wine touring circuit. If you’re flying in specifically for intensive wine touring and want to be near Yountville and Rutherford, you’ll drive more. It’s carved out its own niche: spacious, activity and wellness-focused, genuinely family-friendly.

**Accommodations**

Rooms are spread across ranch-style buildings, stand-alone villas, and private houses give the property a neighborhood feel rather than traditional resort density. Landscaping has really matured and grown in these past few years, so that throughout the property, lush plants and large pollinators delineate pathways and provide privacy (and a lovely fragrance throughout).

I stayed in an Arbor room which had an outdoor shower and vineyard-side fire pit and outdoor seating area. Rambler rooms are the entry-level option which I’ve seen mentioned on this sub before - they’re fine for couples who don’t care about the outdoor shower (they don’t have them), but they’re not the reason to book here.

Villas are where this property shines, and what surprised me most: Stanly Ranch is an excellent family resort. All villas are two-bedroom layouts with full kitchens, living areas, and big outdoor space. Every unit includes a private patio and outdoor fire pit. Configurations are all queen-queen & king setups) and I can picture families actually using these spaces, letting kids play outside, spreading out.

**Pool and Spa**

I want to give the caveat that my family and I are pool/beach people. We bring our bathing suits everywhere we go and if a pool is unusable it is borderline catastrophic for our kids. The pools here are top notch.  They’re all heated to 87 degrees (see my steam/fog filled picture for proof). I swam in December and was genuinely happy (loved the huge hot tubs as well). If you have kids who are water dogs like mine, this place is a dream, especially in winter.

But moving on:

The real strength is the wellness infrastructure: Hale House and Spring House sit together on a dedicated acre designed for “thermal and restorative experiences.” This is one of the best spa setups in the valley, which makes sense. The Bay Area is at the epicenter of the longevity/biohacking trend, and the products, treatments, lotions and potions here all reflect that. I wish I had time to try them all.

Hale House anchors the wellness program with (very large) fitness center, movement studio, and spaces for yoga and meditation. Spring House delivers: cedar sauna, eucalyptus steam room, Himalayan salt room, cold plunge, and hyperbaric chamber (didn’t try but wanted to). The facilities are excellent and designed for guests who want to build wellness into their day, and for people who like to work out on vacation.

**Food and Drink**

I was in the valley specifically for some dining/winery appointments (shout out to my friends at Quintessa - I think their VIP tour is maybe the best in the Valley). I had a few meals at Bear - dining is solid and consistent, thoughtful, well-executed, appropriate to the setting. This isn’t a destination dining property per se, but you eat well and there were lots of locals hanging which is always a good sign. Something I appreciated: property wines (from vines planted throughout the property) are made by Hudson (very good and a smart signal of local credibility). Pastries at the coffee shop rival anything from Bouchon Bakery (nothing can top Model English Muffins but otherwise anything from there too).

I didn’t get a chance to dine there but I peeked into the new dining space, The Bloom Room (floral designer Edgar Martinez Ruacho has filled the private dining room with flowers turning it into “a superbloom”). If you have any interest in appealing to anyone on social media, book this posthaste and get your pics on Instagram. It was cool AF.

Finally, shout out to the minibar, stocked with complimentary soft drinks and genuinely excellent, small production local wines (Corison, Frogs Leap, Anthill Farms) and Rishi teas.

Food for Bear is partially grown on property, as well as eggs from their heirloom chickens and ducks. A very cute little side quest to visit them. 

**Experiences and Activities**

Programming is varied and authentic to the setting: sound baths (this is a California resort after all), falconry, guided hikes, ranch experiences like jam making, cooking classes and wreath making. The Little Ranchers program for kids is genuinely strong and makes this a viable family option in a region where most luxury properties ignore children. Full disclosure I have had family clients stay and love the program - and now seeing it firsthand I want to go back with my own kids to experience.

**Final Takeaways**

Stanly Ranch has found its footing: spacious, wellness-focused, genuinely family-friendly, with modern ranch aesthetics and strong event capabilities. The villas, thermal spa facilities, and southern valley location give it a different character than up-valley resorts—warmer, more relaxed, less wine-centric in tone. Recent leadership has tightened execution where it matters.

**Who This Resort Is For**

•	Wine travelers focused on Carneros AVA and southern Napa who want proximity to cooler-climate producers, sparkling houses, and Pinot Noir specialists

•	Families wanting Napa Valley with genuine kid-friendly infrastructure and accommodations that are set up for them

•	Wellness-minded travelers

•	Guests preferring modern design, outdoor living, and relaxed ranch vibes over traditional wine country formality

**Who This Resort Is Not For**

•	Wine travelers who want to be based near Yountville, Oakville, and Rutherford for intensive up-valley touring

•	Travelers seeking intimate, food-driven Napa hideaways with culinary theatrics

•	Anyone prioritizing classic wine country opulence over contemporary ranch aesthetics​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",3,1765940717.0,FATTravel,1,1.0,False

But lots of troops have no idea how to use the ecwcs properly, so let's teach them.  If you ACTUALLY know what you are doing. Quick primer for those of you with NCOs who don't know/care. 

The Extended Cold Weather System is a set of clothing items designed to keep you warm without overheating under exertion. Each different set is confusingly called a ""level"", which does NOT mean you have to wear all the layers under it to wear the next layer. The system is designed to be worn in 3-ish layers, though sometimes, as we will see, one layer can act as 2 layers. The first layer is the base layer, wicking moisture from the skin, the second layer is the insulating layer, providing warmth, and the third layer is the shell, providing weather resistance. Many times you will find that you will be more comfortable wearing less on your bottom than top.

First, a bonus layer! 

Level 0: your T shirt. not much to say here except one thing. If you have to wear one, and have high speed soffee or whatever t shirts, leave them behind in cold weather. They are cotton or a poly cotton blend, and cotton retains moisture and sucks warmth when wet, and dries slow. You want a polyester t shirt, for cheap stuff the basic training DLATS stuff at clothing sales works, or better yet any of the moisture wicking shirts up there. 

Level 1: the ""Silks"". This is the base layer of the system, and is designed to be worn against the skin. (Don't be a goober and wear it over your t shirt.) This layer has some mild insulating properties, and may be okay on its own (or just the top, yes you can wear the top without the bottoms) in mild temperatures, but its main purpose is to wick moisture away from the skin. You can wear this in lieu of your t shirt, (per ar670-1). Or you can wear your t shirt over it if you need just a tiny bit more, or want to avoid an argument. If you wear the bottoms, those ARE your underwear, dont wear your brown thunders under them. Almost always a base layer, but can serve as both the base and insulation layers in mild temps. Should not be excessively baggy, but not snug

Level 2: the ""Waffles"". This is a combination layer. It is both the second, heavier, base layer and also the first insulating layer (the one that retains body heat) and can be used as either or both. You can wear this against the skin as a base layer, combining moisture wicking and insulation, over your t shirt (remember, cotton kills), or over your Silks,  in that order of warmth. You can mix and match too. Silk bottoms, tee, and waffle top is a perfectly fine combo. Again, this can be used as a base layer OR an insulating layer, or act as both. Should again fit confortably, not loose or snug

Level 3: the Fleece ""jacket"". This is a contentious layer, and i probably wont make many friends right now. Yes, you can wear this as an outer shell or traditional jacket. No, its not a great idea unless there is no wind or precipitation and you know for a fact that there will be none. The fleece has exactly zero wind blocking properties, retains rain, mud, ect ect. However, the fleece excelles at retaining body heat. This is your most potent insulating layer. You probably should not have this on unless you are relatively static, and it works best under your level 4/5/6 top. The silks should be worn under this layer as a base layer, and for very cold weather may be combined with the waffles as well. This is an insulating layer, and should be tried on over the waffle top or ocp top for a comfortable fit. A good rule of thumb is to retain this layer in an east to access place, utilize it while static, and doff it before initiating movement or strenuous work. Also, compressing this layer (ex. Under body armor) limits its effectiveness, though not to the same degree as a puffer or woobie style clothing item like a smokers jacket.

EVERY LEVEL FROM NOW ON SHOULD BE TRIED ON OVER THE FLEECE JACKET TOP AND WAFFLE BOTTOMS FOR A COMFORTABLE FIT.

Level 4: the ""Windbreaker"". This is pretty much what it sounds like. This is a shell layer that is wind designed to keep the wind out, the heat from the insulating layers in, and has mild water resistance. This layer does not have a bottom, so it can be worn with either ocp bottoms or level 5 bottoms, and should be worn over any combination of base and/or insulating layers. PRO TIP: the chest pockets aren't pockets, actually. They are combination heat dumps and hand warmers. When you first start to feel yourself get warm, unzip the chest pockets and billow them open as much as you are able. This will allow heat to escape and is your first step in managing heat before removing a layer. These tend to run short so i recommend one size longer

Level 5: ""the Soft Shell"". This is another shell layer, but for slightly more adverse conditions due to the inclusion of pants and a hood. Just about everything said above applies to this layer as well, with just 2 things to add. If you have made it to this layer, you are no longer wearing either ocp tops or bottoms. Remember what i said about cotton blend t shirts? Your ocp's are a cotton blend and adding them into the mix will defeat the way the ECWCS works. Secondly, there is a notion floating around that this layer is waterproof, it is not a substitute for your wet weathers! It is water and wind resistant, and will soak through in any prolonged precipitation. There is also a school of though that the top should be sized to wear over your kit, thats personal preference. Get with an NCO with cold weather experience.

Bonus level 5.5: your IOTV/MSV. if you find yourself standing around in all your stuff, or are pausing for a moment and need a little warmth, instead of striping and adding layers, you can just throw your body armor on then take off. This works best with an IOTV, but it will put another layer over your core for short pauses, and if your top is sized to be worn over it, can be used as a last ditch insulation layer, just keep it loose to maintain airflow inside your sustem. Also a decent hand warmer. 

Level 6: ""extreme cold/wet weathers"". Look, i dont know whats extreme about this. I dont know the dofference between this and the wet weathers. I DO know what one of your 2 wet weather it is though, its the one with the silvery grey inside, not the black-grey ones. These ones do what they say on the tin, put them on when there is precipitation. I recommed you size these ones to he worn over the entire ecwcs, (level 1,2,3, and 5) and your other wet weathers sized to be worn over your kit. No one likes a wet IOTV. They are also the ultimate wind jacket. Try not to wear these during a movement if you can get away with it, you will sweat. PRO TIP 1: these dont stay waterproof forever. There is a waterproof spray that you get from supply (NSN in the back of the TM for ECWCS) that needs to be reapplied after every washing or hard rain. PRO TIP 2: get these bitches baggy and wear literally whatever the fuck you want under them. Woobie hoodie and pants, whatever.

Bonus Level 6.5: ""MOPP Gear."": make friends with CBRN guy and take your time figuring out what size fits comfortably over your other stuff, jacket and trousers. If you dont have marshmallows, this is your level 7. If you're mounted, youve probably gotta carry these with you anyways and they make a great emergency ""holy shit its cold"" shell layer for static conditions. The jacket is a halfway decent imitation m65 when sized right.

Level 7: ""Marshmallow suit"": size this to be worn over your kit and everything. If you have one, you're probably gonna get real cold weather training. Ive worn these exactly once, so i dont have much experience. I can give you 2 tips thought. This is a down type puffer material, so compressing it will make it not work anymore, so try not to lay down or put body armor over it. And it makes a fantastic parka liner. If you have these, go to the thrift shop, buy a set of wet weathers that fits over them, apply the waterproofing spray, and wear them over to ensure you dont get wet (static only). If its cold enough for marshmallows, getting wet if a serious safety issue.

Thats all for now, if i feel froggy later I'll do a post on FREE gear.

She is an amazingly gifted individual, a highly motivated B type personality. The type of person who is a good friend to anyone in need. She works at a non-profit during the day and volunteers in the community constantly, helping out with differing community non profits in the area. There’s no money in it but there’s a lot of joy.

She has been pondering since graduation to get another degree. With recent upper management complications at work, she’s made up her mind to quit her job and pursue a new 2 year degree that opened up at the university. Her and a friend from volunteering are both going to do this program. The friend has a plan for starting a business afterwards to support all these non profits. There’s already backing and she would like my wife to join her. This would be a great opportunity and she is very excited for this next chapter.

I’ve been the primary income earner in our household. I’ve always said, if she doesn’t enjoy doing it, then to find something else. She’s not frivolous or a job hopper but the time has come to do something different. Unfortunately, this lifestyle makes her financially dependent.

I work 40-70 hours per week at an absolutely soul sucking job. When I get home, I cook dinner. On the weekends I spend my time prepping our breakfasts and lunches, washing/ putting away all the laundry, cleaning the house, and whatever miscellaneous chores need to be done. I handle the finances, though she has more of a mind for it than I do. She’s very busy, so if it doesn’t have to deal with any events in her groups she will forget, I have to do the planning and execution.

Back in college, I had some health issues. The last (2) years these health issues have reared up again. She leaves everything on the floor, doesn’t put trash in the bin, and leaves dishes anywhere. It’s been very difficult to keep the energy to keep up during the week with these health issues right now. That means my weekends are now completely workdays. During these events and event planning, she will go out with her group to hobnob 3-4 times a week. It usually lasts anywhere until 11 or until 2 in the morning.

We’ve talked about it over the years but there’s never any change. She knows I’ll do it. She knows that saying she gets overwhelmed will be seen as an acceptable excuse.

I’m tired. I’m lonely. I’ll still make the coffee she likes every morning. I’ll make her favorite foods and make sure her weekly vitamin holder is filled. I won’t stop loving her. Once she finishes this program, Once she is financially stable and supported by this new position; she can have 80% of everything but she’s going to have to make her own coffee and put her own dishes in the wash. I can’t do this until the day I die.",3,1765940354.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,1.0,False

My sister (35F, first time to Europe) and I (31F, several trips to Europe) just got back from our first Paris trip. I wanted to thank you all for your recommendations and suggestions in this sub; it was very helpful, so wanted to provide my experiences to maybe help someone too!

**The Stars**

\- Hotel Grand Powers (8e): outstanding service starting as soon as you arrive. Hot towels and champagne for check in, daily text messages to see how you're doing, Diptyque bath products. They gave me a hand-written birthday card. Amazing staff and along a quiet street. Would absolutely stay here again.

\- Motors Coffee (3e) and Good News (9e but there are several locations) satisfied my sister's insane coffee addiction. Good News was the few places we found that offered ""large"" coffees by her American standard. Motors had the best breakfast pastries. Try the orange one if it's available.

\- Maison Bergeron (7e): our favorite croissants of the weekend.

\- Several servers/baristas/shop owners allowed me to practice my day 32 Duolingo French. Some just answered in English, but most met me with patience and a smile as if they were saying ""thank you for trying"". I didn't feel discouraged at all not being a native French speaker and can't wait to keep learning.

**The Noticeably Good**

\- Marcello (6e) for Italian and L'Atelier Entrecôte et Volaille (2) for steak frites were our favorite dinners. The truffle special at Marcello and the burger at L'Atelier were surprisingly delicious. Simple service at both, no issues but nothing above and beyond.

\- Focaccia Novettino (9e but there are several locations) was our favorite lunch. Easy and fresh.

\- The SAs at the Rue Cambon Chanel were the friendliest and most helpful. Very patient and willing to show everything in stock. Did not have the same experience at the Rue Saint Honoré location.

\- My sister (a Disney adult, used to have annual WDW passes) LOVED Disney. It was very easy to navigate inside the park and the rides far surpassed their WDW counter parts. For me though (a non-Disney adult), I would've skipped.

\- Flying AirFrance in Terminal 2E was easy upon exit. Our carryon bags were not sized or weighed, which was a point of confusion for us before the trip.

\- We purchased physical Navigo cards for the metro since so many Americans seemingly struggle with loading them onto digital wallets. We found the physical cards so easy to reload at the stations and avoided all confusion.

\- The pastries/desserts at Pierre Herme were better than the macrons.

**The Not So Good**

\- On the Disney topic I didn't realize (due to jetlag, the lack of reliable public transit in the US, or both) that the RER A to Disney split in different directions. We ended up on a train going to Boissy Saint Leger at first, but realized the mistake before it was too late. We were able to switch to the correct train easily. So if you are going to Disney and take the RER, make sure your train is going to Marne La Vallee. It will have a Disney logo on it lol

\- Christmas market at the Tuileries was so uncomfortably packed. We made the mistake of going on Friday night, so I wish we could have seen it during the week. It was nice to be festive but the crowds made it hard to see the booths with any real dedication. I just felt like I was in the way. Same with Galleries Lafayette. The Christmas decorations were nice...but you would've thought they were giving away winning lottery tickets in there. Again probably had to do with our timing but not worth the stop IMO.

1polgq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/COCSA/comments/1polgq8/trigger_warning_i_committed_abuse_during_my/,TRIGGER WARNING: I committed abuse during my childhood (with details),"Hey everyone, how's it going? I'm here to give a detailed confession about my awful childhood.

I remember when I was 5 or 6 years old, I accidentally found a DVD of my dad's. I thought it was one of my cartoons, but when I put it on, it was a sex scene of two women licking each other. I remember staring at it for 5 minutes, and it kind of triggered something in me. From that moment on, I became extremely addicted to sex. I remember that at the same age, around 6, I started having sex with a girl in the family who was a year older than me. I don't remember how it started, I just know we did it (this lasted until we were 13, with both of us consenting). When we were still 6 or 7 years old, we were caught in the bathroom doing it. I remember being punished, but we didn't have any ""separation"" or anything like that. I can't remember any conversations about sex education either, so we continued doing it. When I was about 7 years old, I got my first cell phone, and having access to the internet without my parents' moderation made me addicted to pornography very early on. Seeing all that messed up my perspective on limits; each piece of content was more bizarre than the last. I had access to videos I saw when I was 8 years old. I showed them to my cousins, who were the same age, as if it were a normal video. We watched them secretly, unaware of how harmful it could be. We also did something else; I don't remember the act, I just know we did it naked among ourselves. Around that time, I remember my father discovering my video history, and I could only blame my cousin because I was afraid of being punished, but nothing serious happened. He just said it wasn't my age or something like that, but even so, I couldn't stop. I continued. Some time later, my mother discovered my history. She and my stepfather were disgusted by the situation. She told me she had lost her appetite for coffee. I felt very bad, but I didn't understand why all this was happening if the things I saw were ""normal"" among people. She called my father, and it was the same conversation: promising not to do something like that again. But it was so impossible to avoid; I kind of felt like I needed or depended on it, always wanting to satisfy myself. That's what always happened when I felt that signal in my... When I was nine, my father caught me watching those videos again, and I begged him not to tell my mother so I wouldn't be grounded and have my phone taken away. He didn't tell her, which only made the situation worse. When I was 9 or 10, I watched some videos about incest, themes with stepmothers, mothers, etc., and my stepmother slept with her butt facing upwards in a nightgown, her butt exposed. I always thought about these kinds of videos as situations that could happen, so I ran my finger over her panties, and she turned around in a panic and asked what I was doing. I was scared and pretended I was picking up a little tongue that I'd dropped there. The incident was never discussed. This stepmother also had a daughter the same age as me, and I tried to do something with her (at age 10), but she wouldn't let me (and I didn't really understand why, since I always did it with that other girl in the family). I remember she talked about it with her mother, and my father treated it as something kind of... ""Normal"" for a child, I don't know if he was trying to protect me or was afraid to understand that I was doing bad things, but it was obvious that I needed to be stopped and needed help. When I was 9 or 10 years old, I called a cousin of mine who was 3 or 4 to a room and said we were going to talk, and I only remember her and me lying on a mattress and me rubbing against her, with clothes on, but still something very bad. This only happened once with her. I lived my normal life, I didn't know the weight of these things. When I was about 11 or 12 years old, I was at my grandmother's house and I started to get aroused for some reason, and that girl from my childhood that I used to have sex with wasn't there (she lived next door, like a backyard). I remember sitting outside, aroused, and her younger sister came over, she was about 4 or 5. I ended up abusing her on impulse (I know it doesn't change anything). It was more than just grooming, but there was no penetration (I don't want to go into more detail because it's disgusting). I wasn't..."" I was naive and knew what I was doing was wrong, but I never had good sexual experiences, so I wasn't aware of the gravity of what I was doing. I didn't know how bad it was. I didn't intend to hurt her; in my mind, it would only be a crime if I forced her. I only knew the crime of rape, which was forced sex, in my mind at the time. I don't remember if it was before or after that time, but I was sitting on a park bench and an old man started looking at me, and I stared back. He started masturbating while looking at me. I was offended by that and left. I told my father, he came, and the old man left. Then they asked me if I was staring at him and that's why he did that. I didn't understand very well, but I know I never saw that old man as someone who did anything really bad. Today, I can't even condemn him or wish anything bad on him. I just hope he never did it to anyone else again. When I was twelve, my stepmother's daughter and I started holding hands, something silly that, over time, evolved into... Touching her private parts, something consensual up to a point where she didn't want it anymore, and I insisted until she told her mother. I didn't expect it to escalate into something so serious, after all, they were both doing it. But when my stepmother told my father, he beat me severely. I had never been beaten so badly. I didn't expect that reaction from my father. I thought I would be punished like the last few times. I'm grateful that this happened, and that's when I started to understand the weight of the actions I had taken before. The older I got, the more I realized how abominable the things I had done were, and that turned my life upside down. When I was 14, I started to see myself as a monster. I looked in the mirror and felt so much hatred, indignation, and disgust for myself. I started to see myself only as an abuser, something that shouldn't have existed. I punished myself by punching my body and face. All I could do was cry in the bathroom, or anywhere alone. I had panic attacks and started... I had severe anxiety, I constantly ruminated on these thoughts, and whenever memories of the things I did came back, I would just cry and beg forgiveness from everyone I hurt, praying to God that I had never done those things and that I could have a normal and healthy childhood like other children. I compared myself to everyone around me and felt like trash. I always had suicidal thoughts, but I was always a coward who was afraid of getting hurt, so I never managed to kill myself. I tried a few times to stab myself in the stomach to see if I could achieve anything, but whenever it hurt too much, I stopped and felt like a coward for not being able to do it for them. I wished insane things for myself, wishing something would happen, a natural death, or that a car would run me over. I even wished that someone would rape me so I could get revenge. Everyone around me noticed that I wasn't okay. I withdrew from all social interactions, excluding myself from everything—parents, cousins, anyone I really liked. I didn't have the courage to... Talking to them about what was happening, I was always very afraid of losing them, that they would start to see me the way I saw myself, so I convinced myself that my life was over, I convinced myself that they already saw me as something bad. I started seeing people being good children and having a very good relationship with their parents, and that hurt so much. My heart was destroyed, I felt like my soul was destroyed. I never again saw any hope of having a normal life, a good life, always being labeled as a monster. I resorted even more to trying to kill myself. I tried researching in many ways, but I was always taken to the protection center. I tried to live a normal life hiding behind a mask that wasn't me, always wishing to be what I pretended to be: a good person, who never did anything bad to anyone, a person who helps others and is willing to change others, a good son, a good grandson. And what hurt the most was knowing that I lost the chance to have all that without having enough maturity at the time to understand the weight of my consequences, without... Understanding the magnitude of the mistakes I had made, I always thought that if my parents had seen and helped me when I needed it back then, these things would never have happened. I had some traumas and a severe depression. I became afraid to touch a woman in any way; I didn't want to hurt anyone else. I felt anxious around children, afraid of the things I had done. I didn't want to be a bad person, I didn't want to be that kind of person, but I couldn't do anything about it. I just had to accept that my life was ""over,"" so I just tried to live as best I could. I felt so bad that I went to the people I had hurt, begging for forgiveness. It hurt so much that some of them didn't know why I was apologizing. I could only cry in front of them. I tried to live a life masking everything I felt: the fear, the worry, the disgust, the anxiety, everything bad I felt about myself. I tried to mask it by being a good person, but whenever I was alone, I would shrink and start crying, wishing everything were different. I always wanted to be able to have a relationship, to get to know someone. I wanted someone, to make that person happy, to have a family like I saw in movies, but I didn't have the courage to approach a woman. I didn't want to be a burden and a disappointment. I had a great fear, something that prevented me from having contact with another woman. As I said, I never wanted to hurt anyone again, and I never saw that anyone would want to be with someone like that. I didn't even want to be myself. I always put myself in other people's shoes, always seeing that I only deserved death. I knew I couldn't erase what I did, but that's how I tried to live. After a while, ignoring everyone, I met a woman, and she was interested in me. I started to be interested in her. With each interaction, I wanted to find out what she wanted from me, what she saw in me, since I distanced myself from everyone. It was the only time I let a stranger into my life, but always cautiously. After all, I always missed good opportunities in my life because I felt I didn't deserve them. I even tried throwing my life into religion, but I realized nothing changed; I was deluding myself with... I saw false promises and realized I was becoming one of those Christians who force others to believe, and I didn't want that, so I distanced myself. I always felt lost in my life, without seeing anything good. I really wanted to live, even knowing I didn't deserve it. I wanted to be everything I pretended to be, so I let this person into my life. We became friends, and my feelings for her grew too much. She was too good, but I always distanced myself from her whenever I saw something big developing. I know it hurt her, but I didn't want her to get hurt more by discovering the person I was. But she always got closer, so I just let that feeling surface for the first time. We started a relationship. I was always very afraid to touch her; I couldn't muster the courage to have sex with her for a long time. I had traumas and fears from the past. I was always very respectful, until she took the initiative. I was a little uncomfortable, but I tried, I gave her space, and I felt disgusted afterward. Every time we do it, I end up remembering everything and I feel very disgusted. After a few years, I finally mustered the courage to open up to her, telling her everything in detail. I didn't know if she would believe me or not; I was sure she would distance herself. After all, only I know how I still see myself today, and she knows now too. Even so, she decided to believe me. She sees me as someone who wants to be better, someone who strives to make those they love happy. I still can't understand that. While it makes me happy, it destroys me because I know the responsibility I have to carry forever. She's a very good person, and I love her very much, but I'm afraid she'll regret staying with me. I don't want to be a disappointment in the life of someone who believes in me, so I want to work hard for her. But whenever I see those thoughts coming back, my life freezes. I can't do anything but stay quiet in my corner, dwelling on bad memories and thoughts. This is destroying me to this day.",1,1765939973.0,COCSA,0,1.0,False

The evergreen crown of the trees weeps its leaves / It’s always the same oak-scented breeze / One leaf flew over my head like a joke I didn’t get / Like an easy riddle that I refuse to guess / That leaf was about to land on my shoulder / Unbeknownst to me, a delicate hand reached over / She snatched it and kept it in her pocket / I walked this river as if nothing had happened / How I regret not looking back; it’s that scene / She came out of nowhere; I was not aware

Your bittersweet, musky voice ripens my cheeks / You hum your sultry songs; I can’t speak / There was a word, and it was on the tip of my tongue / Your choice of glances and phrases, a lack thereof / I gun myself never to make you my muse / Yet I cannot be the only one squinting as you / Fly up; I’m barely learning how to / Swift off your flaming bronze feet; can you wait for me / I’m only here to embrace the storm you made / Seasons may change, but my reasons stay the same

Some air must have blown the dirt out of my eyes / I see you clearly; I want you to be mine / Some rising tides, flooding my doors / It's clear that there are signs, only that I am yours

I did think about bringing a big power station to run my Breville, but that felt a bit over the top. So I went with a smaller setup instead: a lightweight portable power station, an electric kettle, a compact grinder, and a French press.

Broker here!

Before the year ends, here’s a checklist to squeeze the most out of your mortgage. Small tweaks now can add up to over $100k saved over 30 years, without changing your lifestyle.

1. Check your interest rate
Even a 0.5% drop can make a huge difference.

$600k mortgage at 6% to 5.5% = ~$68.6k saved over 30 years


2. Use an offset account
Parking savings against your mortgage reduces interest.

$50k in an offset on the same loan = ~$57.9k saved

Combine both rate drop + offset = ~$126k potential savings


3. Adjust repayment frequency
Switching from monthly to fortnightly repayments reduces compounding slightly.

$600k mortgage at 6% = ~$5k extra saved


4. Review unnecessary features
Some loans include redraw or insurance features you might not need. Removing them can lower ongoing costs.

Even small fees = $1–2k saved over time


Example for a smaller loan:

$450k mortgage at 6%, $40k in offset = ~$46k saved over 30 years


It doesn’t require cutting your coffee budget or lifestyle, just some strategic number crunchin. For anyone curious about what tweaks would make the biggest difference for their own mortgage, happy to help work it out.",3,1765939536.0,AUfrugal,0,1.0,False

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just *going through the motions* instead of truly living? Like your energy is a flatline and your focus is scattered like confetti? Yeah, been there. But I've stumbled upon some stuff that's genuinely shifted things for me, and I wanted to share in case it helps some of you too.

Let's ditch the overwhelm and talk about practical, *game-changing* hacks that can seriously boost your daily energy, sharpen your focus, and help you thrive, not just survive.

*   **The Power of the ""Micro-Win""**: Forget huge, daunting goals for a sec. What's one tiny thing you can accomplish *right now*? Making your bed? Drinking a glass of water? Answering that one email? These little wins are like fuel for your motivation. They build momentum and make the bigger stuff feel less impossible. Seriously, celebrate those micro-wins!

*   **Environment is Everything**: Your surroundings have a massive impact on your mindset and energy. Think about it: a cluttered desk can lead to a cluttered mind.
    *   **Declutter**: Start small, just one drawer or one corner of your room.
    *   **Natural Light**: Open those curtains! Sunlight is a natural mood and energy booster.
    *   **Movement Zones**: Designate little areas for different activities. A comfy chair for reading, a clear space for working out.

*   **Fueling Your Engine (Beyond Caffeine!)**: We all love our coffee, but what about real, sustained energy?
    *   **Hydration First**: Dehydration is a massive energy drain. Start your day with a big glass of water.
    *   **Nutrient Density**: Think whole foods. Avocados, nuts, berries, leafy greens. They're packed with sustained energy.
    *   **Strategic Snacking**: Avoid sugar crashes. Opt for things like a handful of almonds or an apple with peanut butter.

*   **Focus Multiplier: The ""Deep Work"" Sprint**: Ever get lost in a task for hours? That's the magic of deep work.
    *   **Time Blocking**: Dedicate specific chunks of time (even just 30-60 minutes) to one single, important task.
    *   **Eliminate Distractions**: Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs. Create a distraction-free zone.
    *   **Pomodoro Technique**: Work intensely for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat. It's surprisingly effective for staying on track.

*   **Mindset Reset Button**: Sometimes, the biggest barrier is our own thinking.
    *   **Gratitude Practice**: Before bed or first thing in the morning, jot down 3 things you're grateful for. It shifts your perspective.
    *   **Positive Affirmations**: Even if they feel silly at first, repeating positive statements about yourself can rewire your brain.
    *   **Embrace Imperfection**: Nobody's perfect. Give yourself grace. It's okay to have off days. The goal is progress, not perfection.

These aren't overnight cures, but little shifts that, over time, compound into massive improvements. What small hack has made a big difference in your energy or focus lately? I'd love to hear what's working for you all!

And hey, sometimes navigating these shifts can bring up a lot. If you're finding yourself struggling with emotional well-being, remember there are resources to help.

Hi, I (26F) work at the front desk of a small business hotel in a very busy area, and I think I need advice?Honestly, I don’t know if I made a grave mistake.

Almost every day, a homeless man enters our building to say hi, ask for water, say some random stuff, and then leave. (Before you ask me why I let him in: in my culture, we treat homeless people completely normally as long as they don’t represent a danger, and every receptionist had given him water/coffee before I even worked here.) He’s not drugged or drunk, but it seems like he has mental health issues because of past addictions. At first he never made weird comments, in fact, his talk was quite harmless about being friends with famous people and stuff like that. He does say some slightly misogynistic comments, but so do most men from my country.

Last month, he made a dirty “joke” that I did not like, and I let him know, it was a “joke” about me sitting on a dick. He apologized and didn’t come back for a few days, then came back like normal. After that happened, I’ve been denying him water and coffee, politely telling him multiple times that the reception space is only for guests, yet he keeps coming back. Every time I tell him the same thing, he says some nonsense and then leaves.

However, today he made a comment about raping me, which is completely unacceptable, creepy, and disgusting. I told him to leave immediately, to which he didn’t respond and just stood there. I repeated that he had to leave, and he began insulting me (not yelling, just insulting). Then I escalated the situation by getting mad. I started yelling at him, “YOUR COMMENTS ARE UNACCEPTABLE. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE NOW AND DO NOT COME BACK.” “I DON’T WANT TO SEE YOU HERE OR I’M CALLING THE POLICE.” He stood there by the door, not wanting to leave, to which I responded by yelling in his face, “LEAVE AND DO NOT COME BACK.” When he left, he stood outside looking at me and insulting me from the other side of the glass window. He wasn’t yelling, but his face was so scary.

Now, I’m regretting it. Honestly, I don’t know what came over me. I never scream, but I was enraged. I don’t get paralyzed by sexual harassment, I get mad… I was so mad by the fact that this man is friends with nearby store owners, and he would never say that to the male workers in the area. I’m terrified because he knows where to find me, and you never know what someone like him is capable of, he was very mad.

Tomorrow I have to work… same hours, same place. What do I do if he comes back? Should I call the police the moment I see him enter? I’m thinking of keeping the door locked, but guests enter and leave all the time during my shift. Has anyone gone through something similar? I’m no longer mad I’m just terrified for my safety..

I've prided myself on fostering deep meaningful connections, and that includes people where a romantic relationship might not have worked but where there is still a person worth sharing friendship with. These two people were exes from years past, and content to be my friends (as far as I knew) with the occasional coffee catch-up and a call every now and then to see what's happening in each other's lives. But this year brought new, younger, partners their way and all of a sudden I found myself on the blacklist with no warning or communication.

It's like just because they are male, and I am female, that I absolutely cannot be trusted. Both these new partners have never spoken to me or know anything about me.
If they did, they'd know I'm not like...a horrible person that would ever threaten their relationship. The insecurity in these people is just incomprehensible to me.

I'm bisexual, I don't have this safety net of only befriending girls .

From tights to veils - everything!

Irina barely had time to blink. The first blow was in the temple, the second - in the forehead.

\- What are you... what are you doing?! - the girl shouted, instinctively covering her face with her hands.

This story began with the fact that sometimes guardian angels interfere in our lives, protecting us from rash decisions.

Irina met Artem at the university. He was a teacher at the department, looked almost like a senior, but a strict look betrayed maturity and experience. He was about thirty.

Irina immediately attracted Artem's attention: long blond hair, slim figure, light smile, which made his heart beat faster. He often asked to stay after classes: check the tasks, discuss projects. Gradually, he became a ""special teacher"" for her.

Irina was flirshing with happiness. Not some classmate, but an adult, confident man takes care of her! The girls in the group were jealous, the guys were squinting, and she more and more often caught herself thinking that she really fell in love.

Artem took care of it beautifully: brought flowers, made morning coffee, gave a ride by car. Everything seemed serious, adult and almost fabulous.

Six months later, he offered her a hand and a heart.

\- Why delay? - he said, looking into Irina's eyes. - It's fate.

Irina was confused, but she heard only the main thing: ""fate"".

She immediately called her mother:

\- Mom, Artem made an offer!

Svetlana Viktorovna was silent for a long time.

\- Daughter... you're only twenty-two... Maybe you'll live together first? See how it will be...

Father, Nikita Ivanovich, frowned:

\- Who is this Artem? Let's look at it ourselves first.

But Artem insisted on introducing Irina to his parents first. Their house was spacious, with a fireplace in the living room and flowers on the windowsills. Olga Petrovna met Irina with a cold look, a restrained smile only increased the feeling of tension. Mikhail Ivanovich seemed good-natured, but almost silent.

At dinner, the questions followed one after another:

\- Where do your parents work?

\- How much do they earn?

\- How many years have you been studying?

\- How is your health? Are your monthly regular?

Irina answered honestly, but was embarrassed at the last question. She felt like she was on the exam without preparation.

When she said that her father was the boss in a large company, and her mother was a housewife, Olga Petrovna barely perked up:

\- I have money... Well, then you won't disappear.

Irina then did not understand that these words were not approval, but neglect. Artem looked only at his mother, as if enjoying her every line.

Irina's parents looked worried:

\- What a sloppy... - grumbled the father. - Will he be able to protect the family?

\- He's not an athlete... - my mother added. - Too cold look...

But Irina was blinded by love. One thing was ringing in my head: ""I'm a bride.""

The wedding was scheduled for August. Irina already presented a cream dress and a small bouquet of lilies. But the plans collapsed when Olga Petrovna said that Irina would get married in her dress.

\- You'll put on my dress, no talk! And no girlfriends, no ransom and nonsense! - she ordered.

Svetlana Viktorovna's daughter watched it with sadness.

Two weeks before the wedding, Irina came for a fitting. Artem was not at home, Mikhail Ivanovich was also absent. The apartment was quiet, only the clock was ticking quietly.

\- Well, Irochka, - Olga Petrovna said, taking out a dress from the closet, - be careful. It's thirty-five years old... not a joke.

Irina started pulling on new tights. And then the door suddenly opened.

\- What are you doing?! - the mother-in-law shouted.

I whispered. ""Just go!"" He shouted, pushing me toward the door. ""We'll talk when you're not being hysterical. I need to calm Vanessa down now. The door slammed behind me. I stood in the hallway, blood dripping onto the floor. Seven years. I had stood by Brian through everything after my parents died. He had found me at my lowest point and promised me forever. Then his best friend died, and everything changed. He had made that promise over Jason's corpse—that he would take care of Megan no matter what. I had sacrificed my dreams, turned down promotions, and canceled my art school scholarship all to help him build his career while I faded into the background of our relationship. I still remember the night he held me as I sobbed over my parents' graves, whispering that he would be my family now, a promise that turned to ashes in my mouth. I went to the bathroom down the hall to clean my wounds, wrapping a towel around my arm to stop the bleeding. When I returned to our apartment door, I heard sounds that stopped me cold. “Oh, Brian... yes... right there..."" ""You're so beautiful, Vanessa. You're all I need."" ""What about Viola?"" ""She means nothing to me now. You're the only one I care about."" ""Harder, Brian... please..."" My heart shattered into a million pieces. So this was the truth. Sending me away wasn't about calming Vanessa down, it was an excuse to be with her. I entered quietly, numb to everything but the pain in my chest. I went straight to our bedroom and pulled out my suitcase, throwing in everything I could grab. Brian appeared in the doorway, his hair disheveled, lips swollen. ""What are you doing?"" I didn't look up as I continued packing. ""I'm leaving. I'm done with your lies.""
Chapter 2

CHAPTER TWO ""What do you mean you're leaving? Are you serious right now?"" Brian's face twisted with disbelief. I clutched my suitcase tighter. ""I can't take this anymore. I'm bleeding because Vanessa pushed me through a glass table, and you're acting like I'm the villain!"" Brian ran his hands through his disheveled hair. ""Vanessa is having an episode and instead of being understanding, you want to leave? How selfish can you be, Viola? After everything we've been through!"" ""Selfish? I've given you seven years of my life!"" ""And what about Vanessa? She's lost everything! Her parents, her brother—Damien was all she had left, and now she only has us! You know she's fragile. You know she needs special care!"" ""And what about what I need? What about…"" ""God, it's always about you!"" He slammed his fist against the wall. ""I promised Damien I would take care of her. What kind of man would I be if I broke that promise? Is that the kind of person you want to be with? Someone who abandons people when they need help?"" Tears stung my eyes. ""That's not fair."" Brian's expression suddenly softened. He walked over and took my hands in his. ""Okay, I'm very sorry. I shouldn't have yelled. You're hurt. Let me take care of that wound for you."" I stood frozen as he began cleaning the cuts on my arm. The sudden change in his demeanor confused me. Just as he was wrapping a bandage around my arm, a piercing scream came from the living room. ""My head! Brian! My head!"" Vanessa wailed. Brian immediately dropped my arm, letting the bandage unravel. ""We have to go. Now."" ""But my arm…"" ""That can wait,"" he snapped. ""Come on, we need to take her to the hospital."" I stared at him in disbelief. ""Am I seriously expected to help take care of her after what just happened?"" Brian's eyes flashed with rage. ""Because of YOU, she's having an episode now! Come on, let's take her now!"" He rushed to Vanessa, scooping her into his arms while I stood there, wounds still fresh, my promotion news forgotten. He didn't even look back as he barked orders at me. ""Grab her purse! And don't forget her medication!"" At the hospital, Brian transformed. The man who moments ago had wished I would bleed more was now frantically calling for doctors, his voice breaking with concern. ""Please, someone help her! She needs immediate attention! Is there a specialist available?"" The nurses rushed Vanessa into an examination room while Brian paced the hallway, making calls to every doctor he knew. I sat alone in the waiting area, the memory washing over me like cold water. Last year, when I had that severe abdominal pain, Brian had simply told me to ""take a Tylenol and stop being dramatic."" By the time I called my colleague Sandra to drive me to the hospital, the infection had spread. The doctor said if I had waited even two more hours, I might have died. Sandra had stayed with me all night while Brian was ""working late."" I later discovered he was with Vanessa, comforting her after a bad date. Once Vanessa was stable, I slipped away. There was something I needed to get from the hospital—the small urn containing my parents' ashes. The only thing I had left of them after the car accident that took them both three years ago. When I returned to the hospital, Brian looked relieved. ""Thank God she's stable now,"" he said, not even noticing I'd left. Then he lowered his voice. ""If something had happened to her, you would have joined your parents soon enough."" My blood ran cold. Had he just threatened me? Vanessa emerged from the room, leaning dramatically against the door frame. ""I feel so weak,"" she whimpered. Brian immediately rushed to her side, scooping her up in his arms. ""I've got you, sweetheart,"" he whispered, his lips close to her ear. The way they looked at each other made me sick. Like I wasn't even there. ""Let's get you home,"" Brian said, carrying Vanessa toward the exit. I followed silently, clutching the small urn to my chest. When we reached the elevators, Brian pressed the button. ""Wait,"" I said. ""Can we take the stairs? You know I'm claustrophobic."" Brian rolled his eyes. ""Are you serious right now? I'm carrying Vanessa! We can't take the stairs!"" ""But I can't"" ""God, Viola! Can't you be considerate for once in your life? Vanessa needs to rest! She can't walk down five flights of stairs, and all you are thinking of is your irrational fear?!"" The elevator doors opened, and Brian stepped inside. I hesitated, my heart already racing. ""Get in or stay behind. I don't care anymore,"" he snapped. I stepped into the elevator, pressing myself against the wall as my chest tightened. The doors closed, and I felt the panic rising. My breathing became shallow, and the small space seemed to shrink around me. ""Brian,"" I gasped, holding out the urn. ""Please help me hold this. I can't—I can't drop it."" But at that moment, Vanessa moaned. ""My head is pounding again.” Brian immediately turned his attention to her, adjusting her in his arms, whispering soothing words. ""Brian, please,"" I begged, my hands shaking violently. ""It's about to fall—"" Too late. The silver urn slipped from my trembling fingers, hitting the elevator floor with a crack. The lid popped off, and the ashes—all I had left of my parents scattered across the dirty elevator floor. ""No!"" I cried, dropping to my knees. ""No, no, no!"" I tried to scoop the ashes back into the broken urn, but it was useless. Tears blinded me as I watched the last pieces of my parents disappear between the cracks of the elevator wall.
Chapter 3

CHAPTER THREE I knelt on the elevator floor, desperately trying to gather my parents' ashes with trembling hands. ""Viola, get up. You're embarrassing yourself. People are going to think something's wrong with you. This is exactly why I can't take you anywhere these days."" Brian hissed through clenched teeth. I looked up at him through tears. ""Something is wrong! My parents' ashes are all over this dirty floor! How can you just stand there?"" The elevator doors opened, and an elderly couple stepped back in shock when they saw me on my knees. ""Is she okay?"" the woman asked Brian. Brian flashed his charming smile. ""She's fine. Just having one of her episodes. My poor fiancée has... issues."" He tapped his temple meaningfully. ""We're taking care of her."" The woman's eyes widened as she pulled her husband back. ""Let's wait for the next one, dear."" As the doors closed, Vanessa's voice cut through my sobs. ""Just look at what you've done. You've made a complete scene, and now poor Brian has to explain your behavior to strangers. How many more times must he apologize for you, Viola? How much more can you put him through?"" Brian stepped out of the elevator when it reached the lobby, careful not to disturb Vanessa. ""Viola, we're leaving. Come now or find your own way home."" ""I'm staying,"" I whispered, still trying to scoop the ashes into the broken urn. Brian shrugged. ""Suit yourself."" I stayed behind, trying to salvage what little I could of my parents' remains, but it was useless. Most had disappeared between the elevator cracks or been trampled into dust. Eventually, I dragged myself out of the hospital and took a cab home. The apartment was quiet when I arrived. I went straight to our bedroom and pulled out my largest suitcase. Enough was enough. I couldn't take this anymore. I was folding the last of my clothes when I heard the front door open. ""Viola? Are you home?"" Brian called out. I wiped my tears quickly and stepped into the living room. Brian was alone, his face arranged in an expression of concern. ""Baby, I'm so sorry about what happened,"" he said, rushing to embrace me. ""I should have been more understanding. I know how much that urn meant to you."" I stood stiffly in his arms, not returning the hug. ""You're still upset, I can tell,"" he sighed, pulling back to look at me. ""But it was just a vase, Viola. We can get you another one. A better one—gold-plated, even! Your parents would want you to move on."" Before I could respond, his phone rang. He stepped away to answer it. ""Hey, what's up?... Yeah, she's here... Did she what?... Her stupid ashes?"" His voice dropped to a whisper, but I could still hear him. ""Don't worry about it. I'll handle her."" He hung up and turned back to me with a plastered smile. ""That was Vanessa. She's feeling much better now and wanted to apologize about your vase. Isn't she considerate? You'll forgive her, right?"" ""I've already forgiven her,"" I lied. ""Great!"" Brian clapped his hands together. ""Listen, there's this party tonight at The Sapphire. Let's go—it'll help clear your head. I want to make everything up to you."" Two hours later, we arrived at what was clearly not a small get-together but an elaborate event at a luxury hotel. The moment we walked in, I noticed people staring at us—or rather, at me. ""Your dress looks familiar,"" a woman whispered to her friend. ""Isn't that the same pattern Vanessa is wearing?"" ""God, she's such a copycat,"" another person murmured. ""No wonder he's clinging to Vanessa instead."" ""I heard she can't even keep her job,"" someone else said. ""That's why he's paying for everything."" ""She's so plain next to Vanessa. Like a cheap knockoff."" ""I heard she trapped him after his best friend died."" I looked down at my dress—a simple blue design Brian bought at a department store. As we moved further into the hall, I spotted Vanessa wearing an identical dress, except hers was clearly designer, with good beadwork and superior fabric. I suddenly realized why Brian had insisted I wear this particular dress. ""You knew,"" I whispered to him. ""You knew she'd be here wearing the same dress."" Brian's grip tightened on my arm. ""Don't start. We're here to have fun."" Vanessa spotted us and rushed over, greeting Brian with a lingering kiss on the lips. ""Thank God you made it! Thank you for helping me decorate this hall earlier for my birthday."" Birthday? I turned to Brian in confusion. Vanessa hugged me next, her expensive perfume suffocating. ""Thank you for coming, Viola. It means so much to have you here!"" So while I had been mourning my parents' ashes, Brian had been here helping Vanessa decorate for her birthday party. He'd told me we were going for a simple night out—not that we were attending the birthday celebration of the woman who had pushed me through a glass table this morning. I watched in horror as Brian wrapped his arm around Vanessa's waist. ""You look stunning tonight,"" he whispered, loud enough for me to hear. Vanessa giggled, pressing herself against him. ""You already told me that when you helped me zip up this dress."" I stood there, invisible, as they continued their intimate conversation. When Brian's hand slid down to Vanessa's waist, pulling her closer, I walked away toward the bar. ""Vodka, neat,"" I told the bartender, fighting back tears. ""Make that two."" I turned to find Vanessa standing beside me, a cruel smile playing on her lips. ""You know, Viola,"" she said, taking the drink from the bartender, ""I've always wondered what Brian saw in you. You're so... ordinary."" ""What do you want from me, Vanessa?"" ""I want you gone."" Her smile disappeared. ""Brian and I have been together for over a year now. The only reason he hasn't left you is because he feels sorry for you—poor, orphaned Viola with nowhere to go."" ""You're sick, Vanessa."" Her eyes flashed with rage. ""And you're pathetic. Still hanging on when he's made it clear who he wants."" She picked up a glass of red wine. ""Here's a little birthday gift from me to you."" Before I could move, she tipped the glass, spilling wine all down the front of my dress.
Chapter 4

CHAPTER FOUR The cold red wine seeped through my dress, clinging to my skin. I gasped, jumping back as people around us turned to stare. ""How dare you!"" I shouted, my voice trembling. Vanessa's eyes widened with fake innocence. ""It was an accident!"" Before I could respond, she grabbed another glass from a passing waiter and poured it over her own identical dress. ""Oh no! Look what happened to me too!"" she wailed dramatically. I stood frozen, confusion washing over me. Why would she ruin her own expensive dress? Brian rushed over, his face filled with anger. ""What's going on here?"" ""Viola pushed me!"" Vanessa sobbed, throwing herself into his arms. ""She ruined my dress because she was jealous that mine is designer and hers is cheap!"" ""What? That's not true!"" I protested. ""She poured wine on me first!"" The crowd that had gathered around us began whispering. I could hear their judgments. ""Poor Vanessa..."" ""That Viola is so jealous..."" ""I heard she's been harassing Vanessa for months..."" Brian's eyes narrowed as he looked at me. ""How could you do this? On her birthday?"" ""Brian, please! She's lying! I didn't…"" ""Enough!"" he shouted, silencing me. ""You've been acting crazy all day. First the scene at the hospital, now this?"" Vanessa buried her face in his chest, her shoulders shaking with fake sobs. ""I just wanted us all to have a nice time..."" ""I know, baby, I know,"" Brian cooed, stroking her hair. He turned to me, his voice cold. ""You couldn't stand that her dress was better than yours, could you? You had to ruin it if you couldn't have the expensive one."" ""That's ridiculous!"" I cried. ""She's manipulating you!"" ""The only one manipulating anyone is you,"" he hissed. ""You've been trying to make Vanessa look bad since the moment you met her."" ""You're choosing to believe her over me? After seven years together?"" ""Seven years of what, Viola? Seven years of your constant neediness? Your jealousy? Your pathetic attempts to compete with Vanessa?"" Each word was like a knife to my heart. ""You know what?"" Brian continued, his voice dripping with disdain. ""I'm tired of making excuses for you. Tonight was supposed to be special for Vanessa, and you've ruined it—just like you ruin everything!"" Vanessa pretended to sway on her feet. ""I feel faint,"" she whimpered. ""I've got you, sweetheart,"" Brian said, lifting her into his arms. He turned to me one last time. ""Don't bother coming home tonight. I'll be comforting Vanessa."" As they walked away, I heard him whisper to her, ""I'm sorry she ruined your birthday. I'll buy you a new dress—anything you want."" I stood there, wine dripping from my ruined dress, as the crowd parted for them. The whispers followed me as I stumbled out of the party, humiliation burning my cheeks. When I finally made it back to our apartment, I went straight to the bedroom and pulled out my suitcase. This time, I was really leaving. My phone buzzed with a notification. It was Vanessa's social media update: ""His stupid fiancée tried to ruin my expensive dress out of jealousy, but my Brian is getting me a new one—even more beautiful than before! Can't wait to wear the wedding dress we picked out last month! #FutureMrsHuntington #CountdownToForever"" The post included photos of Vanessa trying on wedding dresses, with Brian smiling beside her in several pictures. The dates on the posts showed they were taken weeks ago. My heart shattered as I scrolled through them. They had been planning this wedding while I was still wearing his engagement ring. While I was still cooking his meals and washing his clothes. My phone buzzed with a message from Brian: ""Sorry about my outburst and making you feel disgraced. I've ordered that expensive case for your parents' ashes. Bringing it home soon. We can talk when I get back."" I deleted his number without replying. Then I reached into my purse and pulled out the divorce papers my lawyer had prepared earlier that week. I signed them and left them on the kitchen counter with my engagement ring on top. As I was about to leave, I noticed a small package on the coffee table. It was a wedding invitation—for Brian and Vanessa's wedding. Next month. So this was their plan all along. Push me out just before their wedding. Make me look unstable so no one would believe me when I told the truth. I grabbed my suitcase and took one last look around the apartment that had been my prison for seven years. Then I walked out, closing the door behind me forever. At the airport, I clutched my ticket—one-way to Paris. The weight of seven wasted years finally lifted from my shoulders as I walked through the terminal. ""Miss? Your boarding pass?"" the attendant asked. I handed it over with a smile. ""Thank you."" As I settled into my seat, I looked out the window at the city lights below. You took everything from me, Brian. Now watch me build an empire that will bring you to my knees",1,1765938696.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

The next few days run like clockwork. I wake up, get dressed, brush my teeth, and send Anna one of Ruthie’s photoshoot pictures. Clearly, she’s enjoying her time away; I get short messages back - some variation of ‘my cute/lovely/pretty daughter/Ruthie/baby girl’, and a ‘thank you so much for taking such good care of her!’ By day four, her responses are just emoji reactions. Fine with me. 



I’m not going through the rigmarole of changing a doll’s nappy twice a day, so I leave Ruthie’s on, and put a clean one in the nappy pail. That way, Anna will come home to freshly washed nappy cloths regardless. I do make her a bottle, though - I test the temperature on my wrist and everything - and ‘feed’ Ruthie for a minute or two. I just use the same bottle throughout the day - I stick to the feeding times, but I’m not making up 8 separate bottles a day for a doll. I feel bad putting the excess formula down the sink, but it’s clear Anna’s been using them, and I don’t want her to come back to full cans and accuse me of starving her imaginary daughter. 



Then, the rest of the day is mine. I can watch whatever I like on Anna’s big telly - no Mum over my shoulder turning her nose up at all of my watch suggestions, or commenting on how ugly she finds the actors. I really never wanted to go into childcare, but if most of the job is watching TV in peace, then maybe Mum was right after all. I can’t tell her that, of course. I’d never hear the end of it. I listen to music, I play on my phone. I relax, and I *feel* relaxed for the first time in a long time.



I go to bed at whatever time I like (which I’m annoyed to find out is not much later than Mum’s been demanding), and dress Ruthie in her onesie pyjamas before I settle down for the night myself. It can be fiddly fitting her bent arms into the narrow sleeves, but I manage. The novelty hasn’t quite worn off, so I have enough shots of Ruthie in different outfits to keep me going for at least an additional week. Job well done. 



The nightmares aren’t fun, but it’s easier to get out of bed in the morning when the adrenaline makes you feel like you’ve just snorted a line.



\-



On day five, my phone rings. It’s Mum. I stare at the phone screen for a moment, and consider rejecting the call. I don’t, though, and I take a deep breath before pressing the answer button. 



‘Hi, Mum.’



‘Abigail, it’s been nearly a week. I’ve been worried sick.’ 



‘Why? You know where I am.’ 



‘Do I? For all I know, you’ve run out on your job and gone to France.’



‘France?’ I ask, stifling a laugh. ‘Why France?’ 



Mum sighs exasperatedly on the other end of the phone. ‘Abby, please don’t change the subject. Why haven’t you stayed in touch?’ 



I try to think of a way to say *because being away from you has been absolute bliss* that won’t set her off, but I come up empty. 



‘I guess I’ve not been on my phone much.’ That’s a lie. I lost three hours to Instagram doom scrolling this morning. ‘Sorry, Mum.’



‘You’re definitely feeding the baby enough, aren’t you? They need more than three meals a day.’ 



I roll my eyes. ‘I *know*, Mum. There’s a schedule.’ 



‘And you can’t give water to a baby that young.’ she adds



‘Yes, we covered that in the course. Remember, that course I did for a whole year?’ 



‘I remember you saying that poor woman who taught you was barren. What would she know?’ 



‘I didn’t say she was *barren*, I said that she and her partner were trying IVF. She only told us because they thought one of the embryos might have taken.’ 



‘And it didn’t.’ Mum retorts.



*Peaceful thoughts*. ‘She had 30 years’ experience working with kids. I think she knew what she was doing.’



‘Well, let’s just hope you do, too.’ 



I hold the phone away from my mouth so that she doesn’t hear me trying to compose myself. I know Mum doesn’t have the most faith in me. I just wish she didn’t have to make it so bloody obvious. 



‘Thanks, Mum.’ I grit out. 



‘She sounds like she needs changing, Abby. When was the last time you changed her?’ I pull a face at my phone. Is Mum receiving messages from Ruthie via long-distance osmosis? The house is silent, save for the gentle hum of Anna’s double-door fridge, so I’m not sure what Mum thinks she’s hearing. 



‘You’re right,’ I say. ‘I’d better go and change her. Talk soon.’ I hang up before she can get another word in. 



I saw some Haagen-Daazs in the freezer earlier. I think I deserve it after a chat with Mum.



\-



For the first time in five days, I forget one of Ruthie’s feedings. For a second, I panic, before realising how silly I’m being. What’s she going to do, starve to death? Still, I can’t shake the weird guilt as I go up to the nursery for the belated feeding routine. I open the door with some trepidation, and Ruthie is…



Fine. Obviously. Still, I think the formula is starting to turn - I shouldn’t have left it so close to the radiator. There’s a slight sickly-sweet smell pervading my nostrils, and I have to breathe through my mouth so I don’t get nauseous. I pick up the bottle, and pick up Ruthie, and hold the nipple to her plastic lips. 



I stand there for a while, rocking the doll, staring out the window to the street below. No one looking in would be able to tell she wasn’t real, but the people passing by don't look up once, too focused on their journeys home from work. My mind wanders, and I think about Anna. How did she get to this point, and why is there no one looking out for her? 



Her partner left her, clearly. Maybe when they lost the baby, maybe when she got the doll. But then, maybe the doll was his idea. Maybe he left when she stopped treating it like a doll.



Where are her friends, her parents? I imagine myself in the same situation; insisting to Mum that she wasn’t a toy, that my baby had come back, *can’t you see her*?



For all my Mum’s faults, she’d never let me end up like this; playing house with a child that wasn’t really there. I snort then, realising that that’s exactly the situation I’m in, and all thanks to Mum, after all.



I start, suddenly. Tension in my scalp, a sharp pain. Looking down, my hair has gotten twisted around the doll’s arm, as if she’s reached up and pulled on it. I tuck her under my arm and fix my hair. I’m going loopy. Maybe this is how it started for Anna.



Enough. 



I put Ruthie into her crib, her plastic eyes staring straight ahead of her into the baby monitor camera. Grasping her by the skull, I twist her head around until she faces the wall. I don’t need a creepy doll staring me down all night. 



What I need is to feel normal again. I’ll go back to playing dollies in the morning; tonight, I need to be in the land of the living.  



Downstairs, I find a packet of microwave popcorn in the pantry, out of place amongst the supergrains and muesli. Perfect. 



I pair my microwave popcorn with a shit sauvignon blanc I smuggled in when I arrived, and even shitter television, and settle in for the night. Anna has properly posh throw blankets - thick and soft and so warm. I let myself imagine being in Anna’s shoes; maybe not the baby, but living by myself in a big, lovely house. Away from the oppressive atmosphere of Mum’s flat. Just space and quiet and independence. Maybe I could get my own fake baby to keep me company. I’d probably prefer a cat, though. 



My head starts to nod during the final 15 minutes of Love Island. I could fall asleep right here, but my anti-depressants wreak havoc on my skin if I don’t take my makeup off at night.  At least I can go through Anna’s cabinets and see what expensive products I can afford to take a swipe out of. Then I’d see how effective my Superdrug stuff *really* is. 



The credits roll, and I gather my bowl and glass to take to the kitchen. The baby monitor is on the counter, placed in a way that seems almost accusing. I feel a twinge of guilt; I had promised Anna I’d keep an eye on Ruthie. But exactly what trouble was a lump of unsupervised plastic going to get into? I dump my stuff in the sink, and pick up the monitor. Then nearly drop it again. 



I’d turned Ruthie away from the camera. Why, then, was she now facing it, mere inches from the lens? For a few minutes, my eyes are locked with the doll through the monitor, my heart pounding in my chest. Like I’m scared that if I take my eyes off her, she might suddenly vanish, then show up behind me or something.



*Get a grip,* I tell myself. I must have misremembered. Maybe there’s some sort of motor in the doll, like those backflipping dogs. Unlikely, but still more likely than the doll coming to life. I hurry up the stairs, storming into the nursery. Ruthie is staring straight at me with those painted eyes. I pick her up by the arm, dangling her as I push up her top and inspect her for a battery pack, or wires, or *something*. I drop her back into the crib, and take a few deep breaths. *The doll didn’t move. You just remembered wrong.*



I hate this feeling. I hate feeling like I can’t trust my own eyes, my own memory. *I thought I was doing better*. I have been. I spent six months of my childhood on a fucking psych ward, and I am not going back. 



I grab the knitted blanket that’s draped over the edge of the crib, and cover the doll. There. She can toss and turn as much as she likes under there, as long as I don’t have to see it.  



I go into Anna’s bedroom and find her Macbook on the desk. Sitting, I fire it up and start googling flights. 



It was a conversation I’d had with my therapist after my last attempt; *You don’t want to die, you just don’t want to be here. So why pick the nuclear option?*



She was right. Ending my life didn’t have to mean dying; it could just mean escaping to a new one. Suicide felt like freedom, but so could selling all my earthly possessions and working on a rice paddy in China, or volunteering at an animal sanctuary in the Dominican Republic. I could do anything, go anywhere, and I’d never have to speak to Anna, or Mum, or the girls from the ward again. 



For an hour, I research yoga retreats in some of the most remote locations in the world, then how to get hired at one. I look at nearby hostels, the local currency, traditional food from the region, until the buzzing in my head is finally silent. Then, I delete my browsing history, and shut down the laptop. 



It’s a coping mechanism, that’s all. I’m never actually going to up sticks and Eat, Pray, Love my way through Asia. It’s just not an option for someone like me, unless Anna decides to up my payment by several tens of thousands. But deleting my history is far cleaner and easier than scrubbing blood off Mum’s bathroom tiles at 2 in the morning. Still, I’m tired. My head hurts, and my body aches from the tension I’ve been holding in it. 



I go straight to bed without washing my face or brushing my teeth. I forgot to take this morning’s dose of medication anyway.  



\-



I can’t sleep, because the bed has lumps. Sharp lumps. I cry out as something digs into the flesh of my hip, breaking the skin. I inspect the damage, and there are tiny half-crescents carved into my skin, blood beading up in the wounds. Little fingernails. I roll over, getting tangled up in the duvet, clumsy with panic. Ruthie is crushed in the dip left by my body, her head at an unnatural angle, and her mouth gasping for air like a fish.



I wake up.



I fumble for the baby monitor, sure that Ruthie will have thrown off the blanket somehow. It takes me a moment to process what I’m looking at. But, despite my paranoia, I realise that the dark shape on the screen is just the blanket, exactly how I placed it. I force myself to slow my breathing down. 



*The doll is not possessed, get a grip.* 



Still, something’s wrong. The red light on the monitor is flashing. Not quickly or evenly, which might indicate a low battery, but lighting up randomly for a few seconds at a time. As if it’s picking up noise. I hold the monitor to my ear. Nothing. I turn the volume dial all the way to the right, then try again.



Silence. 



I twiddle the dial, in case it turns the wrong way, for some reason. Apparently not. Low battery? But the picture doesn’t flicker. I stand still, and strain my ears. The house is silent, save for the ticking of the kitchen clock, loud enough that I can hear it from downstairs. I approach the staircase, straining my ears for any noise. The monitor continues to flash, though the blanketed shape doesn’t move. 



Slowly, I creep into the hallway, padding along as if I’m afraid of rousing something. The blood is rushing in my ears, but it’s the only sound I hear. The door looms ahead of me, a portal to whatever chaos is being quarantined inside. I press my ear to the wood, but can only hear my own heartbeat.



I curl my fingers around the doorknob, knuckles blanching white as my grip tightens, but something stops me from turning. A creeping, rising dread in the pit of my stomach. I don’t want to see her. The idea of looking into her lifeless, painted eyes makes me sick, the nauseating sour milk smell suddenly coming back to me.



I let go of the knob. 



The light on the monitor has stopped flashing, and stays off. Ruthie, I decide, can look after herself tonight. 



\-



I sleep fitfully; waking up from half-remembered dreams of babies and shitty nappies and women in saris, before plunging back into sleep. I’m finally startled awake by a high-pitched scream. The adrenaline courses through my body as I sit straight up in bed. I wait, and listen, but no other sound comes. The scream must have been part of a dream; the sound produced inside my own head. 



The central heating hasn’t quite kicked in properly yet, so I pull my cardigan over my pyjamas, and steal downstairs, not sending so much as a glance towards the nursery door. I make a disgusting bowl of muesli with soy milk and bring it back to bed with me. I spend the entire morning watching TikToks on my phone, though I rarely manage to make it through a whole video, as short as they are. So much for taking this job seriously. Well, as seriously as you can take caring for an inanimate object. Anna doesn’t seem particularly preoccupied with the welfare of her daughter - she hasn’t even seen the message with the last photo I sent. Still, I send her one of Ruthie’s wake-up photos, sending it to my recycling bin afterwards so I don’t use it again.



Just after noon, the doorbell rings. I freeze. A parcel? Or a friend of Anna’s? I don’t want outsiders coming into the house, not with whatever sinister presence is lurking just beyond the nursery door. But if I don’t answer, they could tell Anna, who might worry and return, cutting the sit short. I force myself out of bed, and hurry downstairs. 



I shouldn’t have worried. Not about that, at least. It’s Mum. 



‘What are you doing here?’ I ask, opening the door and stepping back to give her space to enter. 



‘I wanted to see how you were getting on.’ Mum says, already scanning her environment. And I want to see that baby.’



‘You can’t.’ I say bluntly. ‘She’s sleeping.’



Mum purses her lips disapprovingly. ‘At midday? You should have gotten her up by now. And still in your pyjamas. I thought you were going to take this seriously.’ She tuts at me. I just stare back numbly. 



‘So? How’s the baby?’ she asks, labouring her words like I’ve refused to answer a question she never asked in the first place. 



‘Sleeping.’ I say again.



‘Yes, you said. How are you getting on?’ 



‘It’s fine. She’s really easy.’ 



‘Really?’ Mum eyes me. ‘You look like you’ve barely slept.’ 



‘The mattress I’m on,’ I lie. ‘It’s really uncomfortable.’



‘Don’t tell me she’s got you on boxsprings, a big house like this?’ 



‘It’s memory foam.’ I say. I don’t know why I feel the need to defend Anna. ‘I just find it too soft to sleep on.’ 



‘Oh, well; apologies for not getting you accustomed to memory foam mattresses.’ *Oh good, sarcasm*. ‘I did the best I could with the lot I was given.’



‘I didn’t mean it like that.’ I say wearily. Conversations with Mum feel like I should have warmed up for them, sometimes. 



‘It’s nice.’ Mum says, gesturing to the house; her attention already diverted. ‘I would have chosen a different colour for the walls, but maybe it’s a work in progress.’ 



‘I’m actually really busy today-’ I begin, but she cuts me off.



‘Nonsense, they’re easy at this age. Or is she making you clean for her, too?’



‘She’s paying me a lot of money.’ 



Mum tuts again. ‘Figures. I’m sure you’re cheaper than hiring a nanny *and* a cleaner.’ Moving to the kitchen, she sees my unwashed dishes in the sink, and shoots me a look. I pretend not to notice. Finally, she finishes her self-guided tour of the bottom floor, and waits expectantly at the bottom of the stairs.



‘Well, take me to the baby.’ 



I swallow. ‘I said no, Mum. She’s sleeping. She doesn’t sleep well.’ 



‘No wonder; you have her sleeping at all hours! Why would she sleep at night? Come on, I want to make sure you’re looking after the baby properly.’ 



I bristle at that. After all her insistence that this was my calling, pushing me into taking this job, she’s not convinced I can do it?



‘Anna asked that I don’t have visitors round.’ I say.



‘Good.’ Mum nods approvingly. ‘You’re caring for a baby, you’re not on holiday.’ 



‘That includes you.’ 



Mum sighs.



‘Darling,’ she begins, her voice dripping in faux concern. ‘You’ve not been well. This is a big responsibility for you, and unfortunately, you still need me to make sure you’re progressing forwards, not back.’ 



I swallow hard, and bite back tears. *I’m doing better. I am.* 



Aren’t I?



Mum’s timing, as usual, is spot-on. The weird stuff that’s been happening lately; I can’t help but worry that I’m slipping back out of reality. The pit in my stomach threatens to bubble over, and I try my best to breathe through it. 



Mum’s watching me, a vague expression of satisfaction on her face. Sometimes it feels like she wants me to stay sick. Stay reliant on her. I can’t let her live my life for me. 



‘I’d like you to leave, please. I’ll see you when the job is finished.’ 



Mum cocks her head condescendingly. ‘It’s nice to see you assert yourself. But I need to check on the baby.’ She begins to climb the stairs, and I get a flash of her finding Ruthie under the blanket. How would I even begin to explain? Even if she believed that Anna was the one who thought the doll was real, she’d probably end up getting *her* sectioned. 



‘Why don’t you run out and pick us up some coffees?’ I try, my brain working overtime to get her away from the stairs. ‘My treat. There’s a lovely little coffee shop at the end of the street.’ 



‘You go.’ Mum replies immediately. ‘I’ll stay with the baby.’ 



‘Anna would kill me.’ I gabble, adrenaline thumping in my chest as she inches closer upstairs. ‘She said specifically that I had to be with her at all times. She said the only reason she hired me was because she trusts me, and she’s never been able to trust anyone else. Plus, I’m pretty sure there’s cameras, so she’d know.’ 



I’m just talking, now. Mum’s not an idiot, but my half-panicked rambling wouldn’t convince her even if she was. But she has paused her journey up the stairs, at least, and turns towards me slowly. 



‘Oh, God.’ Mum says, her eyes widening in melodramatic horror. ‘You’ve not done anything to the baby, have you? *Have you, Abby?*’ 



‘What? No, of course not. She’s fine. Ruthie’s fine!’ I need to get her out of the house. My chance to tell Mum the truth has well and truly passed; I can already see her working herself up, and if she finds out the truth, she’ll come up with some ridiculous theory - I killed the real Ruthie and buried her under the floorboards. There never was an Anna, and I’ve just broken into someone’s house to play a reverse Norman Bates. Or, most likely, that this is some jab at her; a convoluted metaphor for her horrible parenting that I’ve set up, because *everything* is about her.



‘Get *out,* Mum.’ I say, surprising myself at the quiet threat behind my firmness. Mum also falters for a moment. But then, her expression turns nasty. I know this look all too well; the curled lip, the bright eyes. The *sneer*. The mask hasn’t slipped for a while. We got the hang of playing Mum and Daughter while I was on the course, because for so long, her favourite role was bully. 



‘The thing is,’ she spits, through gritted teeth, ‘your track record with babies isn’t the best, is it, love?’



It’s like a punch in the gut. She always knows exactly what to target. When I was younger, I used to wish she would just hit me instead. At least I’d have bruises to show someone, bruises that would fade with time, and not stick around for years after, haunting me every time I tried to sleep. Chipping away at my sanity, until I’m being tackled to the ground at 14 years old with a bloodied compass in my hand and deep red gashes trailing up my arms.



‘Don’t.’ I murmur softly. Mum just nods, her expression regretful but her eyes still fierce.



‘I have to, Abby. No baby deserves what you did, and if I can save this one from a similar fate, then it’s my moral responsibility.’



*I hate you*, I think, repeating those words over and over in my head until I’m silently screaming them at her. But I don’t dare open my mouth. If the waterworks start, she wins.



‘Now,’ Mum continues, her voice still low and dangerous, ‘I’m not leaving here until I know that little girl is alive and well, because I just can’t trust you, my darling.’



‘Please, Mum.’ I choke out. Mum just smiles, then turns and starts back up the stairs. As soon as her back is turned, I slump against the banister. Of course she wins, she always wins. This was my chance to get away from her, if only for a while. Time for the house of cards to fall down.



Halfway up the staircase, Mum stops. She turns back to me, her face registering something like…disappointment? I search her face for some clue for what comes next. 



Just like that, the mask is back in place, and she sighs heavily. 



‘Well, I’m relieved.’ she says. ‘I don’t know what all the melodrama was about, Abby, I really don’t.’



I watch her in stunned silence. I can’t work out what just happened. Is this a trick? Is she trying to distract me so she can tackle me into submission? I step back as she descends down the stairs, just in case, but she moves past me, towards her bag and jacket. 



‘I have neither the time nor energy to go through this again, so you get your wish; I’ll leave you alone. Natasha will be pleased; she’s probably been feeling quite neglected with all the time I’ve spent worrying about you instead of looking after her. And in the state she’s in, too.’ she adds, reproachfully. 



Tash will definitely not be pleased. I’d gotten a mardy text from her a couple of days ago, sarcastically thanking me for freeing up so much of Mum’s time that she was now able to turn her attention on Natasha and her bump. Mum was never as awful to Tash as she was to me, not by a long shot, but it doesn’t mean she can stand her either. 



It takes another minute or so to usher Mum out the door, and my arm is itching to slam it in her face. Before she finally leaves, she tells me,



‘You know I’m proud of you, don’t you?’ 



It *hurts*. The insincerity, the gaslighting. The fact that despite everything, I *want* her to mean it. I roll my eyes to hide the tears welling up in them, and her lips purse. 



‘I think you should probably check on the baby.’ are her pointed, parting words. It takes every ounce of my mental fortitude to close the door without slamming it behind her.



I go to the couch, bury my face in Anna’s thickest, fluffiest cushion, and I scream and scream and scream. 



It’s the first night in this house that I don’t dream. 



\-



In the morning, I go to take a shower - I was instantly enamoured with the rainfall shower, and have been using it daily - but my hand falters on the tap. I’ve ignored the big, clawfoot bath under the window. I can’t even remember the last time I had a bath. It was CAMHS’ treatment of choice whenever I’d ring them for help, but the pokey little tub in Mum’s bathroom wasn’t so much a suicide deterrent as it was an inviting receptacle for a toaster. This, however, was a bath you got in for pleasure, not one you got crammed into with your sister after a muddy day at the park. There was a basket so chock-full of Lush bath bombs that I could take one without it being missed. And besides, hadn’t Anna told me to make myself at home? 



I use a bath bomb *and* bubble bath. They kind of cancel each other out, but the real luxury is being able to use either without Mum in my ear warning me about bacterial vaginosis. The bath is absolutely *steaming*, and I dip my fingers into the colourful, soapy surface. I snatch my hand back out. Of course, someone like Anna wouldn’t be relying on a crappy boiler that only got going once the bath was half-full. I brace myself and plunge my hand back in to pull out the plug, dousing my hand with the cold tap before I can feel the burn. 



While I leave the water to equalise to a more bearable temperature, I nip to the kitchen for a hot chocolate. I’ve well and truly given up on the coffee machine, but a hot bath and a fancy Whittard’s hot chocolate almost make the whole haunted doll thing worth it. I check my phone while the microwave heats up the milk, swiping away the message and voicemail notifications from Mum. She hates me giving her the cold shoulder; that’s *her* strategy. If I ring her back, she’ll start acting aloof; as if I’m not the one returning her call. She’ll string me along until I finally apologise, like I always do. But I don’t need her; I can handle this. I’m a fucking adult now; a fact I think she’d like me to forget sometimes. 



Mug in hand, I make my way back up to the bathroom. A few more minutes of twiddling with the taps, and I finally have a bath that’s a decent temperature. I slip into the water, and lean back against the sloped end of the bath. 



For a few minutes, it’s wonderful. Peaceful and warm, the concoction of bath products just short of being overwhelming. But then, I remember exactly why I stopped having baths. 



\-



I’m twelve years old and I’m staring at a pregnancy test I swiped from Boots; the cheap ones they don’t lock away in the cabinets. 



‘What does two lines mean?’ Elliot asks. Even at that age, in that moment, I recognise the irony of having to explain how a pregnancy test works to the grown man who’s made it necessary for me to use. 



‘Pregnant.’ I say. My voice doesn’t sound like mine. 



‘Check again.’ he says. 



‘What the fuck do you think’s going to change?’ I snap. ‘Two lines means pregnant, check it yourself.’ I pick the box up from the sink and throw it at him. I was so bold back then; I didn’t even care that it would probably earn me a slap. He doesn’t move, though, and the box hits him in the shoulder, before falling to the floor.



‘I can’t be a dad.’ he says blankly, and I let out a wordless shriek, pushing him out the door and slamming it in his face, my knickers still around my ankles. 



*I’ll kill you if you end up like me*, Mum had always said. I’ve beaten her record; pregnant two whole years younger than she was. The tummy ache I’ve been feeling for weeks straight is worse than ever. There’s a *baby* inside me. I want to vomit and vomit and vomit until it comes out, but even I’m old enough to know that’s not how it works. 



Naked from the waist down, I stand in the filthy bathroom and contemplate what comes next. 



I’ll get fat and throw up every morning. A great, disgusting whale that smells of sick and cries all the time. I have vague memories of Mum pregnant with Tash. She’d always been so glamorous and energetic, and suddenly she was this big, angry lump on the sofa, who never had the energy to wash herself or tidy up. For the first few months of her life, I hated Natasha for it. I used to give her little head or body a smack when Mum was out of the room. It didn’t matter; I always got shouted at when the baby started screaming; whether it had been my fault or not. 



I’ll have to stop going to school. I’ve only just been deemed cool enough to hang out with Daisy and the other girls; the bullying would be even worse than before. Not just a chav, not just a crybaby, but *worse.* All the names I’ve used on other girls I know; skank, slut, sket. Short, guttural words you can spit at someone, or hiss under your breath when they pass.



Elliot will go to prison. I can tell the police it wasn’t him, but Mum will sing like a canary once she knows her suspicions were true. She loves being right, much more than she loves me. I’ll get put into foster care; maybe Tash too. Besides, if one of Mum’s kids could go so astray, it must be her parenting. We’ll get dragged out of the house in front of the neighbours, and Mum will never talk to me again, even when I’m older, and the father of my child is a registered sex offender. 



Because then, there’s the baby. They’ll make me keep it, probably, like Lila from over the road did, even when they put her in the group home. I’ll have to feed it and bathe it and change its shitty nappies, and pretend that I love this creature that’s ruined my entire life. 



But I have options. Babies are delicate, even more so before they’re born. After all, Mum had tried her hardest to keep her pregnancy after Tash. She was determined not to have the same complications that had come up with baby number 2, so she ate healthy, rested as much as possible, and took so many pills and vitamins she could have run a pharmacy out of our medicine cabinet.



And it still died inside her. 



\-



I can hear a baby crying. 



I clamber out of the bath. All the therapy, all the medication, all the fucking *years*, and the memories are still vivid as day. I know better than to let myself go back there, but here I am; in a nice, head-clearing bath - like a clear head isn’t exactly what I always try to avoid. 



I don’t bother towelling myself off; I just pull last night’s knickers and t-shirt onto my wet skin. I hate the feeling, but it’s comfortingly distracting. The crying continues, needling its way into my head. I hum, trying to drown it out. It’s so lifelike - high-pitched and desperate, with a raw edge to the sound. 



It’s coming from the nursery.



I burst into the room, dripping water and bubbles all over the floor. The sound persists, seemingly muffled under the blanket that covers Ruthie. 



Five things I can see; blanket, crib. Don’t break down. Window. Four things I can touch; who cares? Three things I can hear; screaming. Why is the doll screaming? Dolls don’t scream. I can’t hear two other things, it’s just *screaming*, filling up my head until it’s about to explode. Screaming, my screaming this time. Do I sound scared or do I sound angry? I don’t know, I can’t think shut up shut up *shut up*.



I rip the blanket off, and the screaming stops. Mine and hers. But her plastic has turned to flesh, and it’s a real baby squirming under my horrified gaze. 



I know who’s haunting me, now. I never gave you a name. It would have made you real. But you’re not real; you’re a memory, and Ruthie is a doll. I know what you want, but I can’t give it to you. I pick Ruthie up by her onesie; I couldn’t bear to feel skin instead of plastic. She dangles in my hand as I take her through to the bathroom. 



I remember your face - eyes blinking up at me from the bottom of the toilet bowl. Your little mouth opening and closing for a moment before I flushed you away; like you were trying to form the word *mama*. Of course; you didn’t have a face. You couldn’t have been more than 7 weeks of growth - you weren’t baby-shaped yet, just a clump of blood and tissue, like everyone says. But I saw you clearly, a fully-grown newborn with tiny fingers that reached for me. And I pulled the chain. 



I’m sorry, but you’re going back into the water. It’s where you belong. At least the bath probably smells nicer. This whole house seems to reek of rotten milk.



\-



I climb back into the spare bed, still naked and dripping wet. I don’t feel tired, or scared; I don’t feel anything. Just a slight ringing in my ears from the screams. Maybe I sleep. More likely, I stare at a blank wall for hours on end.  



\-



The sun is setting by the time I finally drag myself out of bed. My hair feels neither dry nor wet, but some stiff, greasy combination of the two. I feel empty. Physically empty - I haven’t put anything in my body since the two sips of cocoa I managed before my bath - but also spiritually empty; exorcised. I wish it felt like a relief, to have the metaphorical monkey off my back, but there’s a creeping dread I have to push down; like I’ve lost some vital part of myself. 



Ruthie is still floating in the bath; plastic once more. I pick her up and hold her to my chest in some ghoulish parody of skin-to-skin contact. I just hold her and rock my body from side to side, water running down in rivulets between my breasts.



‘Sorry.’ I mumble to her.



I’m not ready to live on my own; that much is clear. I’ll finish out the week, then tell Mum I’m sorry, and can I stay in my room? She’ll pretend to be annoyed, or disappointed, but secretly, she’ll be glad. Things are always good for a while once I’ve admitted that I need her. She’ll remind me to take my medication more regularly, and I’ll go back to the bland, agreeable shell of a person I’ve been until recently. Turns out that *is* the better-case scenario.



I carefully dress Ruthie in the prettiest dress I can find in her tiny wardrobe, and tuck her into her crib. I even press a kiss to her tiny, plastic head. Then, I go back to bed.

1pokx4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeWrite/comments/1pokx4x/any_feedback_appreciated/,Any feedback appreciated,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/[r/DrCreepensVault](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/). The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.",1,1765938397.0,FreeWrite,0,1.0,False

1pokvny,https://i.redd.it/d980cps3do7g1.png,Please Rate My Resume – Seeking Entry-Level Positions (Civil Engineer / Quantity Surveyor / Graduate Engineer / Junior Management Trainee / Junior Project Manager) Constructive criticism is highly appreciated.,"I am currently preparing for job hunting early next year and would appreciate feedback on my resume. I am considering whether to start submitting applications by February or wait until March due to personal circumstances. However, I also recognize that the first quarter of the year typically offers more job opportunities, making it an ideal time to apply.

**Notes and Clarifications:**

1. Board exam rating was intentionally omitted as my rating is not worth mentioning (below 80).
2. School year and academic term for university projects and research were excluded.
3. Month and year of seminars attended, as well as specific dates for certifications and licenses, were not included.

**Reason:** Space constraints and the goal of maintaining a concise, efficient one-page resume.

A short gap year may be noticed, but this can be explained by my decision to prioritize obtaining professional certifications and to take time to attend to personal obligations and responsibilities.

**Language Proficiency:** Fluent in English and Filipino (omitted from the resume due to space limitations).

University projects and research were included to demonstrate relevant skills in **quantity surveying, project management, and materials testing**.

**Questions for Feedback:**

1. Should I tailor or “retrofit” my resume for each job application?
   * For example, adjusting the listed software based on the job posting. While I am highly proficient in quantity take-offs and transportation-related software, I am still developing my skills in design software such as AutoCAD, MIDAS, and Revit (not currently listed). Would it be better to customize these per role, or is listing all tools acceptable?
2. My licenses, certifications, and training are currently grouped together due to space constraints. Should I prioritize this section further by adding dates, even if it exceeds a one-page resume?
3. Regarding honorifics and suffixes after my name (e.g., **RCE, SO2, RMP, ME-1**):
   * Is it still appropriate to include these after my name if they are already specified in the licenses and certifications section? I have seen others do this, but I am personally unsure if it adds value.

Tonight, we feast!  The bears fired 17 million arrows today, and we ate them all.  We opened at the perilous low of $1.25, staring into the abyss that claimed us yesterday.  But there was no fear this morning.  No hesitation when dawn crested the horizon.  The ""First Light"" revealed a battlefield that belonged to us.  Bears emerged from the defenses with swords drawn, and coordinated a precision counter-attack that reclaimed the $1.38 resistance in the first 15 minutes of trade.  Price smashed the door down before the enemy could even pour their coffee.

The most telling signal came AFTER the violence.  **Silence**.  Price held its ground on only 17 million volume, far below our 30-day average of 38 million.  How?  Because the sellers are exhausted.  They could not push price down because they had nothing left in the quiver.  The supply is drying up.

We closed at $1.39, green and defiant.  The Closing Cross settled over a million shares yet again, at $1.38, a final attempt to paint the tape, but the structure holds.  We are no longer surviving; now we advance.

Taking a look at the daily, the repair work is undeniable.  ""The Descent"" that terrified the crowd yesterday has been halted, and hopefully for good.  The bottom band of the Keltner Channel was amazingly effective and sent price on a very nice bounce, keeping the trend structure intact.  We should see an interaction with the EMA soon, if not tomorrow.  By turning $1.38 from resistance back into support, we have paved over the cracks in the foundation.  We are now knocking on the door of $1.42.  Three times we marched up to that gate today, and three times we were pushed back.  The bears will call this a ""Triple Top,"" but we know better.  Price didn't flush after the rejection, it held the line.  That is called ""Supply Absorption.""  Let's dive a little deeper.

Zooming in on the hourly, we can see the discipline.  After the morning blitzkrieg destroyed the $1.30 resistance, price spent the entire afternoon in a tight consolidation between $1.37 and $1.40.  This is the ""Flag"" flying over the castle.  The ""Smart Money"" didn't run for the exits.  Instead, they stood in the shield wall and waited.  With the ""Dream Bowl"" Token distribution now just 8 days away, the shorts are running out of time, and today proved they are also running out of ammo.  The session has closed, and the silence continues.  Price held steady at $1.38 throughout the entire after-hours session. The panic is gone. Let's dive a little deeper, as it is time to congratulate the...

...Candle!  Of!  The!  Day!

https://preview.redd.it/9p3vwh2u9o7g1.png?width=1297&format=png&auto=webp&s=24caee310134b741b5f66e5769a399154068771b

Today’s champion is the morning's vanguard!  Dropping into the trench at $1.25, it didn't flinch.  Instead, it led the charge straight out of the gates, ripping through the enemy lines to $1.37 in a single 5-minute breath.  It set the tone, reclaimed the momentum, and proved that the Watch was awake.  We salute you, candle-friend.

Before we end the show, I will provide a forecast for the battle to come.

**Best Case**:  High volume at open, with a rapid claim of $1.42.  Targets would be $1.48 and $1.51.

**Worst Case**:  Weak open, losing $1.38 early.  Downside targets are $1.31 and $1.25.

**Most Likely(Technically)**:  Open in today's range of $1.38-$1.42, staying mostly flat or possibly slightly green.  Energy will build while waiting for a true catalyst later in the week.

Yesterday was the test, and today was the answer.  The door at $1.42 is weakening. Tomorrow, we kick it down.  My merchants are still standing fast @ $1.05, but my eyes are looking towards the sky.  Rest well, Watchmen.  I will return on the morrow.

The Night Watch stands.

1pokpt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pokpt3/update_im_building_a_reverse_job_board_where/,Update: I’m building a reverse job board where companies pitch to candidates - here’s what’s new after 2 weeks...,"Hey r/SideProject, quick progress update.

About two weeks ago, I shared a project I built out of pure frustration with job boards and ATS systems. The idea was simple: flip hiring so companies pitch to candidates, not the other way around.

A lot of you checked it out, gave feedback, and thankfully broke things. Since then, I’ve been heads-down building and tightening the experience.

Here’s what’s changed since that post:

**What’s new and improved**

* The pitch inbox now works like a text-message chat instead of stiff email-style threads
* The sign-in and sign-up flow has been solidified and cleaned up
* Candidates can now view roles and save them to their profile to track interest and status
* Notifications are live. Right now this includes badges and new pitches, with interviews, new matches, and profile views coming next
* Skills gap analysis so candidates can see where they’re strong versus missing
* Role match analysis that breaks down why a role is or is not a fit
* Candidates can browse companies and follow them to track role activity
* Badges are live and active
* The seeker (company) side has officially begun
   * Seeker dashboard
   * Role posting and role analytics
   * Pitching candidates
   * Saved candidates and shortlists
   * Google Calendar integrations
   * Account settings

Over the last two weeks, with the help of test candidates, I’ve ironed out a lot of rough edges. This has meant long nights, early mornings, and more coffee than I’d like to admit, but I’m okay with that.

Even if this never becomes the next massive hiring platform, I know why I’m building it.

I was a desperate candidate once. I was tired of silence, ghosting, and rejection without context. I wanted to know why I wasn’t the right match instead of feeling invisible. So instead of crying into a pillow, I built something that tries to restore a bit of dignity and transparency to the process for candidates and for hiring teams drowning in resumes.

**What I need now**  
I need more real candidates using the platform.

More candidates lead to more signal, which leads to more companies, which leads to better matches. I can’t test that loop alone.

If you’ve ever:

* Been ghosted after applying
* Felt filtered out by bots
* Wanted visibility without spamming applications
* Or are passively open to being discovered

I’d really appreciate you checking it out.

Create a free candidate account, build your profile honestly, and tell me what feels confusing, unnecessary, or broken. There’s a feedback button built in for a reason.

Best on desktop for now. Mobile is still in progress.

If you find something dumb or break something important, you’ll genuinely be helping shape this.

1pokm9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/cant_sleep/comments/1pokm9i/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.



They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.



One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.



“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope. It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it. “Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.” “Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”



They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them. “A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.” “Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.” Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue. “Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.” 

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

diverted from an unseen underground spring rushed through the channels, and the great wheel turned, its rhythmic groan. A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. 

“It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.” A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’” “The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.” “He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’” “An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed. “But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’” “Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle. “The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..” Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom. They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat. It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset. “What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it. “I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it, the final prize.   
“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.” With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut. The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered. “It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area. “Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted. “Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router."" Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud. Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

*Get up*, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. *Get up, you have to move. You* ***have*** *to find her.* The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move. She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface stirred, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

A thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered. ""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment."" There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box."" he listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/nosleep. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

From the first date it just clicked in that rare way where convo doesn’t feel forced. She was smart, funny, a lil awkward in a good way, and we ended up talking for hours then just walking around w no plan. Lots of eye contact, light touching and smiles.

Over the next month and a half we saw each other about once a week. Coffee dates, long walks, one dinner that turned into sitting in her car till midnight. On paper it looked great, but emotionally things stayed kinda safe. No real escalation. Just stuck in that weird in-between zone.

Any time I tried to move things forward she’d pull back a bit. Not rude, just unsure. After our sixth date I finally asked where her head was at. She said she wasn’t sure if it was romantic or more friendship and wanted more time.

Old me would’ve waited forever and overthought every text like an idiot and slowly killed my own confidence. Been there, hated that shit. This time I didn’t. I told her I’m looking for mutual interest, not confusion, and that I was gonna step back. No pressure, no convincing, just honest.

It sucked bc I really liked her, but walking away felt lighter. Like I wasn’t carrying this mental weight 24/7 anymore.

Suddenly, about a week later she hit me up asking to talk in person. We met and I said what I actually felt without rambling or softening it. I used Wingdate AI app thru my airpod just as a small assist to keep my thoughts straight and handle things correctly in the moment, but the words were still 100% mine.She told me stepping back made her realize she didn’t wanna lose me.

We’ve been official for about 2 months now. Things feel calm, mutual, and easy. No guessing games, no chasing, no overthinking dumb shit. Just showing up as myself. Feels damn good knowing it worked out without forcing anything.",56,1765937512.0,dating,11,0.95,False

1pokkhf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pokkhf,Mesquite flour from my desert food Savannah.,"My beautiful mesquite trees always produce huge harvests and never need irrigation. I leave 95% for the wildlife, but there's more than enough for us humans here. Awesome for pancakes and corn bread. 

It can be tricky to harvest without getting wounded a little by the thorns 

The pods are difficult to grind, though. It took me a while to find a method that works. 

The sticky sugars will clog most flour mills. I let them dry on trays and then age in open buckets for at least 3 months so they aren't so sticky and syrupy. Any mesquite bean weevils present will emerge and fly off to find love (don't do this inside your house unless you want pet bruchids). 

I grind them in a Vitamix blender and sift to separate the pod flour from the fibrous pericarps. After drying, it can be milled finer in a flour mill or masa grinder. 

It's very sweet, and can be sprinkled in coffee or on food as a mellow sweetener. 

The fibrous bi-product from sifting makes good animal feed for winter or fine mulch. 

Pods can also be roasted before grinding for a rich smoky treat. Roasted ground pods make a nice beverage when brewed just like coffee. 

Flour or chopped up pods can be boiled in water and reduced to a sweet syrup much like sorghum or sugar cane. The syrup can be made into jelly. 

I find the flour's flavor to be a little overwhelming and prefer to mix it with other flours, herbs, or ingredients.",88,1765937377.0,Permaculture,4,1.0,False

I woke up at 4 a.m. again. The house was cold, a coldness I felt in my heart. Fire and coffee started. Not even the dog wanted to touch the snow today; I can’t blame her.

It’s been 58 weeks since I was forced to leave you—not by my own choice. What hits me isn’t the love we shared; it hadn’t even developed. It’s seeing you. I miss your face.

I miss the little dimples in your cheeks, the cute freckles, your adorable ears, and those hazel eyes. I swear your eyes change color with happiness. I have seen it.

I miss the shape of your nose, your chin, the outline of your jaw—your everything. There’s a mole right above your lip on the left. I always wanted to kiss it. We never touched.

I miss seeing you and the slight smile you always carry. If I were to go blind, I could trace your face with perfection. I studied it well.

1pokhxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1pokhxx/help_with_fudge/,Help with fudge,"Long story short, I'm stupid and messed with the sugar content because things are too sweet to me and it messed with the consistency. So now I need help with ideas to help the consistency of my fudge without it being really sweet and I'm on kind of a time crunch here as I need to make them by Friday morning.

I have a family recipe that hasn't let me down once but this year I wanted to experiment with different flavors. I made a butterscotch and only changed the chips I was using (butterscotch instead of semisweet), but when I tasted it it was WAY to sweet. Turns out theres more sugar in the butterscotch than the semisweet, in hindsight that makes sense. I made another batch and used a little less sugar (recipe calls for 3 cups i only used 2), still to sweet for me but made peace with that, however it took a longer time to set and was still a little soft after 3 days. Honestly I figured I did something wrong in making it this year.

My next test was a peppermint. Sounds easy right? Just use peppermint chips with the chocolate chips. However, no store around me had peppermint chips so I used peppermint extract along with the vanilla and just did half of each so I didn't mess with the original recipe. But, again things being to sweet for me, I used less sugar. This one was the closest to being the right consistency and I think as long as I add a little more peppermint extract and dont touch the sugar ratio it should, maybe, be fine.

Now onto my problem child. The coffee fudge. I did a little (emphasis on LITTLE because I had too much faith in myself) research on this one to find out how to get the coffee flavor in there. As I suspected, instant was the best bet. But as I wanted it to be bitter I didnt add ANY sugar (instantly knew that was a bad idea) and put the instant coffee directly into the fudge. Obviously it didnt set at all. So i tried another batch with a little bit of sugar, probably not enough If im being honest, and since the coffee flavor of the first one wasnt very obvious so I made a very concentrated coffee and added that in place of extract. Aaaand again obviously that one didnt set either because I added liquid at the end.

So my question is, is there any way to make a fudge that will set without adding a lot of sugar and making these two (peppermint and coffee) flavors way to sweet?

The original recipe is:
1 1/2 stick butter
Nestle Semi sweet chocolate chips 12 oz
1 Jet puffed marshmallow cream
3 level cups of sugar
pure vanilla about 2 teaspoons
2/3 cup of evaporated milk",2,1765937169.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

1poka3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheChills/comments/1poka3k/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.



They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.



One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.



“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.



It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.



“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”



“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”



They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:



Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.



A wave of excitement washed over them.



“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”



“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”



Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:



“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”



“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.



The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.



With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.



“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”



They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.



A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.



“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”



A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.



“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.



The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”



“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”



“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”



“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”



“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.



“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”



“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”



“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.



“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”



“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”



“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.



“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.



“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”



Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”



A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.



As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”



“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom



They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.



The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.



“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”



“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”



They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.



It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.



“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”



“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.



Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.



“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.



“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”



They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.



It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.



They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.



“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”



With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.



Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.



The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.



The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.



“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.



“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.



“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”



“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”



“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.



“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”



The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.



“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”



He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.



“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.



“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.



The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.



A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.



""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.



""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""



A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,



No Service.



His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""



""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.



""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""



Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.



Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.



He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.



He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.



""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""



At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.



Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.



The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.



A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.



The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""



Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.



As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.



Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.



""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.



Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.



She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:

I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is; the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other. I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:

You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

* One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday

* One question for me

If you talk about **fashion and modern culture**, they assume it can’t belong here because  
“Chennai is traditional… Chennai is conservative… Chennai is simple…”

But here’s the truth no one talks about:

Chennai didn’t lose its culture.  
Chennai **protected** it.

And somewhere along the way, that protection got misunderstood as *being outdated.*

But the real Chennai we see today is different:

A city where people can wear **kurtas and streetwear, silk sarees and power suits** — and all of it fits.  
A city where someone can go to **temple in the morning and a club at night**, without seeing a contradiction.  
A city where **tradition and modernity don’t fight — they coexist.**

To outsiders, Chennai still looks like:  
*“filter coffee, temples, simple dressing.”*

But the people living here know:  
Chennai is **tech and art, music and fashion, startups and street style, culture and ambition.**

Chennai didn’t stop evolving.  
The world just stopped noticing.

And maybe it’s time we **show the world the version of Chennai we actually live in.**  
Not the stereotype.  
Not the outdated imagination.  
The real one —  
**modern, expressive, stylish, culturally rooted, globally aware.**

This new **Gemini local search update** just turned Google Maps and AI Search into one experience.

# What The Gemini Local Search Update Actually Does

Before, Gemini gave you text answers.

Now, it gives you *local experiences.*

Type “best coffee in London” — and Gemini instantly shows:

* Top-rated cafes
* Photos from Google Maps
* Reviews and hours
* Directions and phone numbers

All in one screen.

No switching tabs.  
No scrolling through listings.  
Just the answer — powered by AI.

This is the **Gemini local search update** in action.



# Why It’s Such A Big Deal

This isn’t a small UX tweak.

This is Google rewriting how people search for local businesses.

Gemini now uses real-time Maps data, local reviews, and images to give you human-level context.

You don’t just *read* about the restaurant.

You *see* it.

That means every business — coffee shop, salon, gym, or local SEO client — now appears directly inside Gemini’s AI answers.

That’s the new front page of Google.



# The Future of Local SEO Starts Here

If you run a local business or work in SEO, you can’t ignore this.

Because the **Gemini local search update** is going to decide who gets attention — and who disappears.

When you ask Gemini,  
“Where should I eat tonight?”

It will pull the top results from Google Maps and overlay them inside its AI summary.

That means optimizing for Gemini is the same as optimizing for visibility in Maps.

Your business info, reviews, and photos now matter more than ever.



# What Gemini Local Search Looks Like

You’ll see cards appear under the AI answer with:

* Business names
* Ratings
* Directions
* User photos
* Open hours
* Review summaries

It feels like Google Maps inside an AI chat.

It’s clean, visual, and fast.

That’s why this **Gemini local search update** changes how people make decisions online.



# How To Rank In The Gemini Local Search Update

1. Optimize your Google Business Profile. Make sure your name, address, phone, and hours are correct.
2. Add Real Photos. Gemini now displays them directly in the AI results.
3. Get Consistent Reviews. The AI summary highlights businesses with clear, positive patterns in feedback.
4. Use Location Keywords. “Best pizza in Chicago” still matters — Gemini pulls location intent from your content.
5. Add Short Descriptions. AI reads these to understand what you offer.

This is how local SEO evolves — you’re optimizing for an AI that summarizes, not a list of links.



# Why This Update Helps Small Businesses

For the first time, small businesses can compete visually — not just by link authority.

Gemini doesn’t just show the top-ranked sites anymore.

It shows the *best-reviewed* ones.

That means good experiences, great reviews, and accurate data matter more than backlinks.

That’s a massive opportunity for local entrepreneurs.

The **Gemini local search update** levels the playing field.



# What This Means For SEO Agencies

Your clients aren’t just ranking in blue links anymore.

They’re ranking in AI answers.

That means agencies must track two visibility points:

1. Traditional Google rankings.
2. Gemini AI placements.

If your business isn’t showing up in AI-generated local answers, you’re invisible to the next generation of search users.

The SEO game just changed — and it’s local.



# What Comes Next

Google’s next move is deeper Gemini integration.

Soon, you’ll ask:  
“Find a quiet café near me with free Wi-Fi and outdoor seating.”

Gemini won’t just suggest options — it’ll show exact spots, user photos, and live directions.

It will feel less like a search engine, and more like a personal assistant with local awareness.

That’s the future of the **Gemini local search update.**



# 5-Minute Action Plan

1. Log into Google Business Profile.
2. Update every photo, description, and category.
3. Ask happy customers for detailed reviews.
4. Add FAQ sections to your website using local keywords.
5. Check your business visibility in Gemini.

Those five steps position you for this new AI-driven local search world.



# FAQs

**Q: Is the Gemini local search update live now?**  
Yes — rolling out in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia first.

**Q: Can I track AI visibility yet?**  
Not officially, but Google will soon show Gemini impressions in Search Console.

**Q: Does it replace Google Maps?**  
No. It integrates Maps into AI — they now work together.

**Q: How do I get my business listed?**  
Use your Google Business Profile and upload verified info.

**Q: Is it free?**  
Yes. It’s part of Gemini’s core features.



# The Bottom Line

The **Gemini local search update** just merged Maps, Reviews, and AI.

It’s faster, smarter, and more visual than anything Google’s ever done.

Local SEO will never be the same.

You don’t rank for keywords anymore.

You rank for *experiences.*

“Shit. Weird dream,” I muttered, unable to grasp what had happened. My breaths were strained, and my heart pounded as I walked to my nightstand.

“Babe, you were mumbling to the wall and then just hit your head on the wall.” She stepped closer to me as I sat on the side of our bed. She pulled the cord on the lamp next to me and grabbed my head, pulling it into the light.

“Well, I have a headache.” My eyes strained against the bright bulb.

The nightmares had started a week before, and they had been getting progressively worse. I didn’t want her to worry, but I knew I would be walking on eggshells if I dodged any more of her questions. It was not the first time this had happened, but it never went physical either. I’d felt like something was coming for me, stalking my dreams and getting closer. The sun was still below the horizon, and my heart was still pounding through my chest and an uncertain queasiness washed through me.

“I couldn’t see much,” she let go of my head and knelt in front of me, “but you woke me up while whispering to yourself over there, and then I just saw you slam your head into the wall.”

 Before she could ask me what my dream was, we were interrupted by our bedroom door creaking open slowly. A silhouette in the doorway snapped us out of our thoughts as its quiet voice broke through my heavy breathing.

“Daddy? Mommy?” It had a familiar drowsy tone and I squinted my eyes adjusted to the light. It was Ava, who had just turned 6 a week ago and was restless for her first day of school that morning.

“Oh, honey,” Jessica sighed and I thought she was trying to console Ava, but I felt her hand rest on my back. When I turned to her, she was looking at me. Her eyes pushed into my mind.

“I had a bad dream,” Ava’s lip quivered as she walked up to my side of the bed. 

I looked at her and for that moment nothing else had happened this morning. I lifted her to my lap and she put one of her arms around me. “Me too, honey.”

“Daddy woke me up.” She pressed against my chest as she softly giggled to her mom . “You saved me from the bad man.”

“Aw, it was only a dream, sweetheart.”  My breath and heart calmed as she settled against my body. I was in parent mode now, and my daughter was upset over her inner demons. I turned with her on my lap and looked at my wife. “Go back to sleep, Jess. I can handle this.”

“Are you sure, Daniel?” She stood up after I nodded and the three of us walked to the door. She kissed Ava on her forehead, and then my cheek, before softly shutting the door as I walked into Ava’s room.

I flicked on the light and Ava flinched in my arms. She was already drifting off to sleep, but I had done too much damage by turning on the light and she opened her eyes wide. Her blonde hair and green pajamas lit up with color. I did my best to avoid the toys and loose stuffed animals on the ground as I took her back to bed and tucked her in.

“He was in the corner,” she looked over to the foot of the bed, clutching the blanket as she hid away..

“I’m gonna stay here with you tonight.” I walked over to the corner, picking up the toys as I went to show her it was empty. “I’ll protect you from whatever monsters are here. Okay?”

“Even from the bad man and the water?” She crossed her arms and looked at me. 

“There’s no bad man, sweetie. Not while I’m around.” I patted her head and tried to hide that the mention of water took me back. My heart pounded again.  “I’ll keep you safe, don’t worry.” 

“I’m scared, Daddy.” Her voice was weak as she spoke. She’d been having nightmares since her birthday last week, but she had never remembered them until that night. “Don’t let him get me.”

“I promise. Nothing will happen to you, sweetie.” I sat along her bed and held her hand as she shut her eyes. She gripped as much of my hand as she could and I felt her hold loosen as she fell asleep. “I love you, dear.”

“I love you too, Daddy.” She spoke as softly as she did when she came to my room.

I stayed awake the rest of the night. Her nightmare permeated my mind as my eyelids grew heavier. Staring into the dark corner of the room, I felt like I could hear water starting to seep through the walls.

...

“Are you doing better now?” Jessica met my tired eyes in the kitchen as she prepared Ava’s lunch and my own. Her hazel eyes matched her silky brown hair as the steam from cooking food rose to her face.

“I think so. It's just going to be a long day.” I poured some coffee and downed the whole cup. The chill from the stone counter shot through my hand as I leaned against it. I still didn’t want to get too far into her questioning, so I made a quick decision. “I’ll get Ava ready.”

“Honey?” She stopped me as I rushed to Ava’s room and I looked back. “I’ll drive her today, you focus on getting to work.”

I could feel her prying eyes trying to break me apart and I couldn’t blame her.  Jess was always trying to get me to open up. It was a part of her work, I would tell myself. She meant no harm. 

We hadn’t spoken much about our childhoods and I would’ve liked her not to pry as much. But I guess that was something middle-aged people sacrifice to avoid loneliness. Being together for as long as we had been, shotgun weddings aside, it did bring me comfort that she respected my privacy and didn’t care too much for my past.

I shook Ava and my nightmares from my mind as I helped her get ready. Honoring my wife’s proposal, I watched them pull out of the driveway before I left for work. The sound of rushing water stalked me on my drive. Penetrating my mind and drowning out the constant drum of the cars around me rolling over the road, flooding the streets, and swallowing any calming silence that could come from our small town.

...

My eyelids hung heavy as I worked in my office and the breakroom coffee wasn’t pulling me from the sleep that I had missed the previous night. Clerk work wasn’t a terrible gig, but I also had no other real talents or skills aside from being good with numbers and overly organized. The telephone hardly rang, and the silence in my cubicle didn’t help me as I kept dozing off.

I was filling out more paperwork and my hand cramped within the first hour of the workday. Everything seemed to drag along as they usually do. The work slowed by midday, and Jess made her usual lunchtime call, asking me how the food was and telling me some gossip about the other parents on the first day of school. I always told her that what the kids tell her as a counsellor is private. She would always brush it off and claim to be talkative. She concluded with the goings-on of her work’s students and their teenage dilemmas. 

Another call started to come through to my telephone and I quickly hung up on my wife after exchanging pleasantries. I switched the phone to the other line.

“Mr. Windsor?” A female voice came through the phone.

“Yes, who is this?”

“It’s Nurse Joyce.” She replied with a rasp that I recognized as a smoker’s. I heard crying from the other end of the line. “From the school. It’s your daughter, sir. We need you to come in to take her home.” 

“Got it.” I stayed silent for a moment, hoping to hear some reasoning for the interruption. Before any voice came through, the crying was cut off by a click on the other end of the line.

My boss wasn’t ecstatic about me leaving, but he could tell I was worried. I stepped into the elevator from the quiet hallway. The doors slid shut and I felt the box start to descend. As I descended, a feeling of queasiness washed over me.

They always say the room starts to spin when you are faint, but the walls weren’t turning like I had imagined. Instead, I felt the ground rumble to a halt. I started to panic even more than I had been, thinking that the elevator was stalled in place. As I peeked through the crack in the door, I didn’t see walls, but instead was looking to an open space. 

I hyperventilated as the sound of pulsing water grew louder. It began to seep through the slit between the doors and the elevator rang as if it had made it to some bizarre floor. A murky water was pooling into the small elevator box.

“No, this can’t be real.” I shut my eyes like a toddler, like my daughter must have when she thought she saw that bad man in her room.

The doors separated slowly, allowing more water to pour in as it settled at my knees. And I suddenly realized where the elevator stopped. My hometown’s Trinity Lake, but there was something different about the water, more polluted and grimier than I remembered. I hadn’t been there since my high school graduation. 

I shook my head violently, hoping that hitting myself would pull me out of this delusion. I was looking down at the dormant water at my feet when I saw a shape form in the smoky brown water. It rose slowly, toward the surface, almost breaking the surface of the water.

“Hey, are you okay?”“What?” I was instantly pulled from the vision by a woman's voice. I was cornered in the back of the elevator. An arm reached out to my hands that were trembling. My hands and eyes went to my legs to see the water, but my clothes were dry. Embarrassment flushed into my face and I could feel my cheeks burning up as I looked into the mirrored elevator wall. I turned to her and quickly stood up, picking up my briefcase and pushing past her. “I’m fine, I just need some air.”

“But sir!” She didn’t continue as I was already out of the lobby and approaching my car.

I almost broke the key unlocking the door and sat down in the seat fatigued. I put my hands on the wheel and started the car. Still rattled from the elevator scene I must have made. My mind raced. I knew what this all was. But I didn’t know what was making me see these things.

Sometime a decade before the drinking age was raised, I graduated from high school and my class held a huge celebration after the ceremony. All 152 of us left our school’s gym in our gowns and triumphantly rode out to Trinity Lake. It was a state park, but we were just kids who wanted a place to screw around and get drunk. I had lacked better judgment not to go out there and been running since the night I peeled out of the lake’s parking lot.

Our graduating class pulled up to the docks by Trinity Lake and started to party. If only the rangers had come by to shoo us away. Our town was small and the rangers knew us, they probably left us to have our own fun before we officially entered adulthood.

The sound of approaching footsteps took me out of my daydream as the building’s receptionist was approaching my window. But before she could knock against the glass, I started the car and drove out of the parking lot.

Every time I looked in the rearview, I saw the same mountain ridge that was hundreds of miles away in my hometown, the same that walled off Trinity Lake. I nearly crashed into a tree on the back road leading to my daughter's school. No matter how far I drove, the mountains stayed the same size. Even if I had turned onto another road, or winded around a bend to where I should face these phantom peaks, the mountains remained in my rear view. And I could have sworn they were getting closer. I fixed my gaze on the road and tried my best to ignore whatever I was seeing behind me.

I pulled into the school’s lot and sped into a space. I didn’t even bother with my locks as I ran into the front office.

“Hello, Mr. Windsor.” The receptionist greeted me by standing up with a tired smile strained from abuse after the first day formalities. The endless welcoming of and lack of reciprocation from the families coming in. “What’re you doing here?”

“What? You called me.”

“No, your wife left early with her. She didn’t tell you?

The same hum of fluorescent bulbs from my office were above the front desk. It grew louder and my head started pounding with the sound of the receptionist’s footsteps bending around the desk. My arms went limp and I barely caught myself on the front desk. The sharp clacking of her heels blended with the sound of sloshing steps through water.

My gaze shot toward her as the sound echoed in my mind. She paused at my sudden movements just before reaching me and she wore a wild look on her face. I looked down to the floor where she stood, but there was no water. I looked back to her and quickly sobered up as I realized whatever happened in the elevator was starting again.

Her expression turned to a concern that pushed into my soul and I could see her step back in hesitation. I tried to calm her worrying at that moment and gave a strange wave, attempting reassurance. I started to walk out and her reflection in the entrance windows stayed still, looking at me as I left.

Knowing if I went back to work there would be many questions, I called the day short and drove home to see my daughter. I avoided looking at my rear-view, not wanting to see my car pursued by the mountains. By the lake. All I thought about was how my wife would react to all this.

...

“Honey.” Jess stood up from the couch in the living room and Ava was sitting on the floor by her feet in a trance. She started to walk to me. “You’re home early.”

“I got a call about Ava.” I stared at my daughter as she wore that same look on her face that I saw on my trip home. She knelt back down to our daughter. 

“You didn’t have to come home, though.” She was still looking at Ava as she put her hand on her back. “Joyce only called you to tell you I was taking her home early.”

“I–that’s not…” I put my things down and approached them in the living room.

“She hasn’t spoken to me at all.” Jess spoke with frustration as she stood and walked away from Ava, handing the reins to me. “Not even at school after she had her episode.”

“Ava,” I sat on the floor in front of her and put my hands on her shoulders. “What happened?”

Ava stared blankly into my chest. After a moment of silence she looked up to my eyes and a glossy twinkle showed me she still was there. Her eyes reminded me of my little sister, Abby. The same auburn hair and the same curious yet helpless look in her eye.

She had tagged along that night at the lake. I didn’t know she was in the backseat of my shitty little car, which was all I could afford from my job. She shouted through the deafening rock music I was playing and handed me a note from our Aunt. It had a few bucks taped to it, and I couldn’t see the harm in letting her come to the grad party, so long as she stayed out of trouble.

“Daddy…” Ava spoke to me and took me out of my daze. “You weren’t there. He was coming for me.”

“Who? What are you talking about?” My chest pounded.

“The man from my dream.” Her voice shook slightly. “Please, don’t let him get me.”

“Oh, honey. I won’t.” I pulled her into my chest and she wrapped her arms as far as she could around me. “I’ll protect you.”

She seemed to have calmed down at that moment and Jess, who had moved to the kitchen, was staring across the space at us in the living room. Her arms crossed and a worried look came across her face as she listened in on our conversation.

I stood up next to Ava and gave Jess a weak smile. She turned away from me and started on supper. With her attention elsewhere, I silently picked up Ava and I carried her to her room. 

...

The next morning was silent and I had woken up in my daughter’s room again. Pans and plates through the walls sounded like some strange machinery turning and shifting. I stood from the floor and fluffed the stuffed animal I used as a pillow so it regained its shape.

I gave Ava a kiss while she rested and quietly stepped out of the room, pushing the door closed softly. I was trying my best to keep quiet, but the door let out a drawn out and quiet squeal. Sneaking through the hall, I entered my home office, and a fax had been sent through from my boss’s receptionist. Martin wants you in today. Early. She signed it with her initials and the rest of the page was blank, but the bottom of the page was damp, leaving it soft and brittle.

My wife left the bedroom door cracked open and I quietly went inside. I wanted to avoid waking my wife while I got dressed to go to work. She was sleeping in the bed and I never saw her move under the comforter. I saw that she left a note on the kitchen counter for me, it must have been why she left the door cracked open. 

Honey, leave Ava with me today. We’ll be alright. Yours, Jess.

I left my own note, some scribbled attempt at gratitude and an apology for the day before. I left it right next to hers and then left the house, not making a sound as I locked the door.",1,1765935852.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pojynk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SirCreepingtonPasta/comments/1pojynk/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.



They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.



One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.



“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.



It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.



“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”



“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”



They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:



Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.



A wave of excitement washed over them.



“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”



“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”



Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:



“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”



“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.



The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.



With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.



“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”



They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.



A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.



“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”



A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.



“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.



The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”



“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”



“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”



“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”



“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.



“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”



“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”



“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.



“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”



“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”



“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.



“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.



“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”



Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”



A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.



As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”



“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom



They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.



The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.



“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”



“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”



They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.



It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.



“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”



“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.



Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.



“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.



“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”



They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.



It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.



They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.



“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”



With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.



Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.



The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.



The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.



“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.



“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.



“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”



“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”



“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.



“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”



The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.



“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”



He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.



“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.



“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.



The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.



A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.



""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.



""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""



A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,



No Service.



His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""



""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.



""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""



Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.



Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.



He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.



He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.



""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""



At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.



Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.



The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.



A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.



The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""



Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.



As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.



Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.



""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.



Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.



She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.



Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.



The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.



The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.



Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud



Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.



Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.



She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.



As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.



She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.



As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?



She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.



""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.



Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.



Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.



The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.



The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.



The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.



Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.



a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.



He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.



""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""



There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""



He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.



He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.



Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

1pojxa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scarebnb/comments/1pojxa7/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.



They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.



One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.



“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.



It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.



“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”



“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”



They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:



Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.



A wave of excitement washed over them.



“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”



“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”



Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:



“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”



“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.



The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.



With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.



“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”



They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.



A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.



“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”



A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.



“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.



The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”



“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”



“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”



“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”



“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.



“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”



“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”



“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.



“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”



“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”



“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.



“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.



“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”



Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”



A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.



As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”



“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom



They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.



The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.



“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”



“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”



They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.



It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.



“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”



“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.



Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.



“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.



“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”



They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.



It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.



They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.



“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”



With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.



Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.



The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.



The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.



“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.



“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.



“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”



“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”



“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.



“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”



The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.



“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”



He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.



“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.



“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.



The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.



A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.



""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.



""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""



A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,



No Service.



His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""



""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.



""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""



Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.



Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.



He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.



He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.



""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""



At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.



Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.



The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.



A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.



The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""



Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.



As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.



Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.



""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.



Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.



She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.



Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.



The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.



The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.



Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud



Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.



Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.



She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.



As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.



She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.



As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?



She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.



""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.



Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.



Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.



The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.



The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.



The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.



Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.



a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.



He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.



""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""



There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""



He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.



He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.



Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.

\* also, incase anyone actually is thinking deeply into this, i am diagnosed with PTSD and an eating disorder which i hear can heavily relate to hormonal disorders such as pcos and endo.

EDIT\*\*\* i am currently on aurovella continuously and have not had a period or pain for 3 months which is a heavy factor into why i am skeptical about surgery\*\*

So I've been single for almost ten years (don't ask me why, I'm 31 F) and I'm finally in a relationship that I feel secured with. 

A few weeks back, my friend hooked me up with one of her husband's friend. And at first I was sceptical only because I've been hooked up before and it didnt end well. But I took the bait and finally decided that if he is going to message me that I'll respond. I've been told by my friends that I can be quite intimidating and I need to chill out. So I did. 

So hes a divorced 33 year old, with two kids. He is the primary caretaker of his kids and he made the time to visit me at work, which I thought was really sweet. 

So finally on our first date, it was so good. Nothing fancy but yet he took the effort. I preferred that he take the lead on where to go, which was a walk on the beach and going for coffee. Couple hours later we didn't want the date to end so we went for pizza. 
He was a gentleman and so considerate with everything.
Me being an overthinker, I asked him so many questions and he for me too, and we have so many things in common. 
After the date, he said he didn't want to wait and asked me to be his girlfriend. 

And now the overthinker has made another appearance. And I'm thinking, am I being love bombed or is this guy being genuine, so my wall is still up.

I am at the very start of my CSF leak journey! I have a lot of medical issues and recently got a hEDS diagnosis and my doctor recommended I read “Disjointed”. I read through it and the big thing that stuck with me was how many of my symptoms fit with a CSF leak. (Add in that they’re common in hEDS and I have history of an epidural and a spinal.) I mentioned it to my neurologist and she suggested I do a 48 hour lie flat test. 

My symptoms completely resolved at 24 hours flat, and not only did my neck have zero pain for the first time in years, I actually had improved ROM as well. By 48 hours, some of my symptoms had returned, including a migraine that started around the 40 hour mark- but I think that’s a combo of not having caffeine during the test, and having some of my POTSy symptoms flood back in. All my symptoms came cascading back once I stood up, way worse than baseline. I didn’t think I could even stay awake for 2 hours, so I drank a cup of coffee and a lot of the symptoms improved, but were still worse than baseline. (I did zero research beforehand on what results meant what because I didn’t want to skew my data, and didn’t even realize there’s a big caffeine connection with leaks, haha.)

I met with my neurologist yesterday to go over the symptom rating sheets, and she confirmed it was a “very positive”(?) result. My MRI with and without contrast of my brain (taken as an epilepsy protocol in November, following a “maybe seizure” that happened in October) did not show anything suspicious that would point to a leak. Neurologist ordered MRIs of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, but said she doesn’t have faith in any of the hospital systems in Wisconsin being able to find a leak and I should prepare that they will all come back ‘normal’, at which point she will send me to Duke. 

I feel overwhelmed. Hopeful, because I feel so freaking desperate to have something to cling to that might make me better, but also scared because I am a single mom of two young children and my brain is spinning a little thinking about how I could even make that work. 

I get that this is a sub specialty, but are there really no closer quality options? I’m in Milwaukee. My neurologist is Aurora-based, but most of my specialists (there are a lot 😅) are within the Froedtert network. My neuro seemed to think Mayo would not be a good option. 

Thoughts? Advice? Things you wish you would have known right when you started exploring this?

1pojuv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1pojuv6/started_a_few_weeks_ago_down_4_lbs/,"Started a few weeks ago, down 4 lbs!","First post here! Just wanted to both track my progress and celebrate a little— I’ll apologize in advance for the long post, this is the first time I’m airing all of what I’m doing to anyone. 

Started on 11/24 (and got a little side tracked with the holidays and being sick, so now on a 2 week streak) to moderate calories and build better habits in general. About to weeks ago I (24f) weighed in at 209 lbs, and am down to 205! :) 

It’s not a lot, it’s not my goal, but it’s important to acknowledge that even a little progress is still progress— this has been a big mentality I have reminded myself. Doing a little is better than nothing, and it leads me to do more! 

Some tips I have for those starting and in it: 

-Don’t wait to start. You can start build better habits right now! Drink more water, sub out the soda. Start moderating and tracking calories. Go for a brisk walk around the block. You can do any of this at any time. 

-have an app or a calendar that you can track your progress. I have found this has GREATLY helped me keep track, and is positive reinforcement when I get to ‘check something off’ for the day. THIS IS NOT A SPONSOR, but I have really enjoyed the app ’Habit’. It helps you make and track new habits (including adding something into your routine or reducing/quitting something). Find something similar! 

-I have a widget on my Home Screen that stares me in the face and helps me track progress. Find something similar that you look at consistently (notepad on the fridge, pocketbook, Home Screen widget, etc.) SEEING what your goals are, and reminding you to get them done. I have a ton of annoying daily reminders to “Drink Water!” “Go for a walk! “ “Workout”

-Find out how you are motivated. I am extrinsically motivated and a very social person. I need a workout buddy that can join me on the treadmill but leave me along for an ab workout. I am fortunate to have a friend that is a great pal for this, and my boyfriend recently started going to my gym! Another person to hold me accountable. 

-Moderating calories has been huge for me. I cut out my daily sugary latte and have been forcing myself to drink black coffee or tea. I always could tolerate it enough, even if it wasn’t what I wanted. It gives me a caffeine fix (without too much caffeine, another habit is to reduce caffeine intake) and is not as caloric. I need to try to make sure I eat the amount I need to, as I have a few times fallen short. However, my appetite has been overall reduced recently. I’m not sure why? 

-drinking water, chewing gum, and making myself chew each bite of food 20 times has helped to make me feel full. It may seem excessive, but I used to just shovel food and not fully chew. Chewing your food makes it easier to digest and activates the saliva proteins and enzymes to help digest food, helping the gut. 

Well I think that’s all I got. Congrats if you made it to the end lol. Remember to recognize the progress you make and even a little is still more than none! Leave some advice and tips in the comments if you have any!! :) ",1,1765935327.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.67,False

I had been experiencing pregnancy symptoms the whole time, nausea, vomiting, sore boobs, exhaustion, cravings.The exhaustion and nausea had gotten better the last couple weeks but I didn't worry because I was still having morning sickness and sore breasts.. fast forward to yesterday, I get to my first appointment and the doctor tells me they are treating this like my annual, they will just due a pap and blood work and follow up to order ultrasounds etc. I asked if we could at least listen for heart rate because ive been so nervous and the doctor agreed. He pulled in the in office ultrasound and was quiet for too long..he told me it didn't look like they would expect for being 10 weeks along, so maybe I was earlier. But I had tested positive almost immediately at 3 weeks, before even a missed period. There is no way I was earlier. The doctor said nothing about not finding a heartbeat but I obviously noticed there wasn't one. He said not to worry yet because the in office scans aren't the best and they ordered a stat ultrasound.

I enjoyed the conversation, we made lots of strong eye contact during, and she was asking me tons of personal questions about me and my life etc.

After that whenever I would see her in this shared public space, she would always come to me directly and keep starting more similar conversations, sit by me, etc.

Eventually I asked for her number and she gave it to me. After that we started frequently coordinating schedules to meet at the place to hang out and do the activity there together as a team, with a group of friends there etc.

There have been multiple times where she has texted me late at night around 11:30pm to ask me when I would be around so we could play together and one time, I was going out of town for the weekend and she texted me at 11:45pm to say “Have a fun trip! Let me know when you get back so we can get some games in together.”

She’s a very social extroverted bubbly person in general and I am exactly the opposite.

During this time we were frequently meeting up but mostly in a group context. Her friend there would frequently manufacture situations for the two of us to hang out in the shared space together.

Anyway, what I’m getting at here is there were A LOT of signals that this girl was into me - probably more than I have ever had from a girl in the past.

Last week she texted me again at midnight and asked if I could go play with her on Monday at 2pm - which I couldn’t unfortunately, but then she rescheduled right then and there for that Wednesday at 11:30.

So we met up Wednesday and had a great time. Tons of chemistry - something which a lot of the regulars at this place have noticed (they started asking me where she was when I was there by myself, and at least 3 different friends there asked me directly if we were dating).

So I knew she was going away for 5 days this past Friday on a ski trip with her family.

I texted her around 10:45pm and said “Hope you have an amazing trip! Want to grab coffee and tell me about it when you get back?”

ALSO she told me she would show me pictures etc when she got back just a few days prior.

She didn’t respond that night or the next day, but on the following day, she “liked” my message and said nothing else lol.

Truly a wild situation with everything else during the past month getting to know each other, coordinating schedules, flirting in person etc.

My plan right now is to not say anything and just see if she re engages once she’s back from her trip.

A little frustrating because I was looking for some real clarity and I feel like she did the least clear thing imaginable lol.

A few weeks ago, right after I got the Lelit Victoria, the Delonghi started acting up. I guess it felt threatened, neglected, jealous, or all three.

It started coming up with error messages saying there was no water in the circuit. And each time, I was able to resolve it by dispensing hot water and running water through the machine.

Yesterday, however, a new error message popped up. With just a hint of irony. See pic above.

I sent the machine to the service centre and was told that the technician found internal leakage, which was causing the machine to be unable to dispense coffee properly.

To resolve this issue, they told me the following parts would need to be replaced — pump, infuser, mechanical valve, trolley (whatever that is) and coffee grounds container*.

Then they told me it was cost around $350 to fix it. I did a quick Google search and found new bean-to-cup automatics at around $450. Called them back and told them to keep the machine.

Now waiting for my new bean-to-cup to arrive in a couple of days.**

* I was told that in order to use the improved trolley, the coffee grounds container must be replaced as well, as the components are designed to work together.

** For those who are wondering why I need a bean-to-cup now that I’ve got an espresso machine, it’s so that those who live under the same roof (i.e. my wife) can have her coffee first thing in the morning before I wake up…and when I’m traveling.

For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/[r/DrCreepensVault](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/). The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration.

1pojhma,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1pojhma/any_feedback_appreciated/,Any Feedback Appreciated,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream. Then, he opened a new browser tab and navigated to a high-end, boutique travel website. He found the listing for the Tuscan villa, its pictures showing a sun-drenched paradise of rolling hills and rustic charm. He clicked on the admin portal, entered his credentials, and marked the property as ""under maintenance."" The listing vanished from the public site.

Finally, he opened a Tor browser, its icon a small, purple onion on his desktop. He navigated to a familiar address: reddit.com/[r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/)nosleep. The page loaded a list of stories, and he began to read, his eyes scanning the titles, looking for a spark of inspiration. He opened a fresh document on his computer and began to take notes, his fingers flying across the keyboard, already building the foundations of his next masterpiece.",1,1765934248.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

But what caught my attention was this street beside the market lined with coffee stores and roasters. The air around the area literally smells like newly roasted coffee as in! Stopped by one of them and found these gems on a glass display. Looking inside I can see the big old-style roasting machines churning out this classic Kapeng Barako. 

I bought some to take home with me. ☕️
