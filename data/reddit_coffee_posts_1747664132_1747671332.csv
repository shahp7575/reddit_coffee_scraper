Before diving into specifics, let me just say‚ÄîI never imagined I‚Äôd get so excited about nugget ice, but as someone who loves hosting gatherings and indulging in refreshing drinks, this machine feels like a luxury I didn‚Äôt know I needed. I‚Äôve paired it with everything from iced coffee to cocktails, and it‚Äôs held up spectacularly. That said, there are a few quirks worth sharing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention was its aesthetic. The stainless steel housing combined with sleek black accents gives it a modern, almost professional-kitchen vibe. I was a bit concerned about its size after unboxing‚Äîit‚Äôs not compact, measuring 16.9 x 9.84 x 16.9 inches, and weighs about 32.6 pounds. This means you‚Äôll need to reserve some counter space or consider storing it elsewhere when not in use. On the flip side, its sturdy build gives confidence it‚Äôs built for longevity. One of my friends who visited immediately asked if I had secretly transformed my kitchen into a bar station with this as my centerpiece.

**Rapid Ice Production**  
This thing doesn‚Äôt mess around when it comes to ice-making speed. In just five minutes, the first batch of nugget ice drops into the basket. I timed it multiple times because, let‚Äôs face it, we all doubt manufacturer claims‚Äîturns out, it‚Äôs legit. If you‚Äôre as impatient as I am when hosting or simply requiring cold beverages on demand, this is pretty spectacular. The full-day output of up to 55 pounds is overkill for most households, but during a recent family BBQ, it came in clutch. Everyone‚Äôs beverages stayed frosty for hours on end. Most importantly, the process is relatively quiet, which is an underrated feature.

**Nugget Ice and Its Perks**  
The nugget ice produced by this machine isn‚Äôt your ordinary cube. If you‚Äôve ever been to a fancy caf√© or a high-end bar and noticed that pebble-shaped, chewable ice, this machine recreates it perfectly. It‚Äôs soft, crunchy, and oddly satisfying to chew on. My kids went absolutely wild for it in their sodas and slushies. Not to mention, it cools beverages way faster than traditional cube ice because of its shape. For anyone into mixology, nugget ice elevates cocktails by keeping drinks colder without watering them down as quickly. I‚Äôve developed a bit of an addiction, adding it to everything from smoothies to plain water.

**Ease of Operation**  
You‚Äôd think an ice maker this advanced would come with a steep learning curve, but it's surprisingly straightforward. Once plugged in, you only need to fill the reservoir, press a button, and let it do its magic. There‚Äôs an automatic ice-making cycle, meaning it knows when to pause if the basket‚Äôs full (thanks to its infrared sensor) and resumes production when there‚Äôs room. My teenager figured it out without any instructions, which is saying something. The intuitive design even extends to the cleaning process. Simply hold the ‚ÄúCLEAN‚Äù button for three seconds, and it runs through a self-cleaning mode. It‚Äôs almost too easy.

**Pros**  
- Produces chewable, crunchy nugget ice ideal for cocktails, sodas, and smoothies.  
- Quick ice-making cycle with first batch ready in five minutes.  
- Large capacity, generating up to 55 pounds of ice daily.  
- Quiet operation, even during peak output periods.  
- Self-cleaning feature reduces maintenance hassle.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The size might be challenging if your counter space is limited.  
- The weight of the unit makes it less portable compared to smaller ice makers.  
- While the nugget ice is fantastic, it isn‚Äôt as durable for hardcore crushing tasks like in certain blenders.  
- It automatically pauses ice production when full, which is generally great, but the 30-minute resume cycle could be bothersome for heavy-duty use.

**Competing Products**  
Having tested a few of its competitors, the Aeitto ICMK18 holds its own‚Äîbut not without valid comparisons. Take the GE Profile Opal, for instance. It‚Äôs slightly more compact and equally adept at producing nugget ice, but it comes at a significantly higher price point. Alternatively, the Frigidaire EFIC235 offers a less expensive way to access nugget ice, though its build feels cheaper and the production speed lags by comparison. What sets this model apart is its balance between capacity, production speed, and overall design. Still, the GE Opal does edge out in visual appeal with LED lighting and app connectivity, if you‚Äôre into that.

**Financial Value**  
This unit delivers serious bang for the buck. While cheaper options exist, they often require sacrificing capacity or production speed. On the other hand, high-end models with all the bells and whistles can cost nearly double. For the price range this machine falls into, you‚Äôre getting industrial-level ice production in a home-friendly appliance. It‚Äôs worth every penny for someone who hosts frequently or values chewable ice. Is it for everyone? Perhaps not. But if nugget ice has become your go-to preference, this investment feels justified.

Acidic foods/liquids. I won't go into the science because I don't really know it but I'll tell you some quick hit optimizations to stop doing and to start.

  
1. Don't take your meds with coffee, orange juice, soda, or anything like that. If you must have coffee, give it an hour before or an hour taking your meds.

2. The more sustainable advice would be to change diet re: acidic stuff but, honestly. Go buy a huge bottle of Essentia alkaline water. Make that be the only thing you drink before and after, and ideally into the next day.

It should feel much closer to how you remember it feeling, but it could take a few days for it to plateau depending on how much of that water you drink. I mean I was getting chorizo sausage egg and cheese bagels for breakfast which I know wasn't doing me any favors in the acid pH game lol.

Warm and spicy cinnamon with a lot of gooey vanilla and coco, and base of a musk vanilla combo - this is NOT blind buy safe unless you can handle sickly sweet perfume smells.

While I have never tried any speculoos biscuit and don't know it's smell, I do love tiramisu and coffee so if you want those, don't get this! 

This is a dense, almost overripe like banana smell that's quite synthetic initially and it starts to blast a spicy sweet cinnabun roll smell massively. Once it is settled the vanilla and some chocolate ish smell shows up (like a very soft version of Al rehab choco musk which is very heavy for me) and the dry down is a sweet skin scent of musk and vanilla.

The starting banana synthetic essence is too much for me so I don't spray it anywhere close to nose, but after 30 mins it's much more enjoyable. I get so strong banana note that idk what their banana bliss even smells like.

I would like to share with you my small mushroom coffee brand that I spent over a year developing. It combines high quality Columbian Arabica coffee with functional mushroom extracts such as lions mane, reishi, chaga, cordyceps - they are also adaptogens which means they help your body deal with your unique stressors. It has a multitude of benefits such as helping with focus, stable energy, stamina, gut health, better sleep and more.  

I developed it mainly because after a lot of trial and error trying to find natural alternatives to adhd meds (this was a slippery slope for me), I stumbled upon lions mane and chaga which were the only things that seemed to make a difference. I later added reishi and cordyceps to the blend as they have athletic and longevity benefits. I've also found it to enhance my stamina and strength in the gym.

This is not meant as medical advise - just sharing my honest experience and story behind the brand. :)

My customers have reported benefits I've personally not felt such as better sleep and feeling well rested (I never struggled with this), so it works differently for everyone on their specific issues which I find interesting having been in business for over a year now and hearing how people benefit from it. 

I also try to find the highest quality ingredients, won't use anything I won't be comfortable drinking everyday. We use double extracted 10x mushroom extracts so its actually potent and is included in active doses, instead of negligible quantities which is common in the industry. They are sourced from the best suppliers who use traditional Chinese medicine standards to grow the mushrooms. As are all the other ingredients we use in the blends. 

We also sell mushroom cacao and matcha. However, mushroom matcha will be out of stock until the next harvest from our Japanese supplier.

1kqfcxd,https://v.redd.it/mqo92afdhr1f1,"My Local QT is Now Officially ""The Future"": Met a Robot Floor Mop, and Humans Are Already Fighting It!","I just had the most surreal experience at the QuikTrip on Hemphill St in Fort Worth, TX (1101 Hemphill St, Fort Worth, TX 76104), and I have to share this. As I was making a beeline for my much-needed coffee fix, a mechanical scrubbing noise started to emerge, and around the corner glided... a robot floor mop!

This wasn't some tiny Roomba; this was a legitimate, autonomous cleaning bot. It politely announced something like, ""Excuse me, I am cleaning the floor. Thank you for visiting QuikTrip."" My jaw pretty much hit the freshly mopped floor. This is my first time running into a robot in the wild like this, especially outside of a lab or a controlled environment.

What really blew me away was how busy the store was. It was absolutely packed with people, and this robot was just navigating through the thick of it. It made two passes, and on the second one, I finally pulled out my phone to capture it.

Now, we've all seen the movies, right? Terminator, Skynet... this is how it starts, people! But seriously, what I found even more concerning (and strangely hilarious) was the human reaction to the robot. I kid you not, I heard several people mumble ""F'n robots"" under their breath. Even more dramatically, I witnessed people deliberately obstructing its path! When the Pudu CC1 politely chirped ""excuse me..."", these folks literally stood there with their arms folded, glaring and ignoring it. It was like a mini, passive-aggressive human vs. machine showdown in aisle 3.

This particular cleaning robot is the PUDU CC1, manufactured by Pringle Robotics (you can check them out at https://www.pringlerobotics.ai/TheBots-cc1 and https://www.pudurobotics.com/en/products/puduCC1). It's fascinating (and a little unsettling) to see these autonomous service robots being deployed in public retail spaces with such high foot traffic.

Has anyone else encountered these QuikTrip robots? Are they in other locations? What are your thoughts on robots being used in public settings like this? Are we witnessing the slow creep of automation in retail, or is this just a practical step towards more efficient cleaning?

Let me know your thoughts on this QuikTrip robot encounter and the future of robots in our everyday lives!",1,1747670412.0,QuikTrip,1,1.0,False

I have torn the ACL while playing soccer. I had a surgery and I need to go often to physio therapist while recovering and preparing to do sports again. I live in Spain but im from Poland. The physio therapist they have assigned me is very handsome, 8 years older then me and dating some 20 year old model (i know it from instagram). He never mentioned that he has a gf. im f32 he is m41

We have a lot of fun during sessions. Its a difficult recovery, so we talk a lot about it, he supported me when i had meltdowns crying. We talk about everything except his relationship hehe. He is also ex soccer player and we talk about spanish soccer a lot. He always have this smile on his face when sees me. Recently he helped me to buy tickets for a concert that it was impossible to buy for because he knew i liked the artist (told me that he remembers when 3 months ago i asked him to play this music for me work out to). 

He is very direct, plans my recovery in details. But we have fun and during last session he danced and sang a bit which i found super funny. He just makes me laugh a lot.

Im very closed and difficult to open up, and i usually wait for the guy to make a first move‚Ä¶i have poor experience in dating men in general long term, so im not maybe making myself avaiable. But i bring often snacks to the clinic, but thats who i am in general. Last session i brought him breakfast (but also for myself). He offered to make a coffee and we sat down for 5 min between sessions. I really like him haha but i also have daddy issues so his unavailability (he is my health provider and is in a relationship) is an emotional high for meü§™  ",0,1747670391.0,physicaltherapy,3,0.14,False

When I brew 500 ml, it's never quite as good - sometimes overextracted, sometimes just lacking a bit of the flavour nuance. I've gotten it pretty close (I increase my grind size, use low agitation, and keep the ratio a bit shorter at 30:500), but I'd love to hear what you do to make the most of your larger batches. 

My go-to brewer is a V60, but I also have a Switch 03 and a Chemex. I use Cafec T-90 filters on the V60, but I'm stuck with Hario tabbed filters for the larger Switch. Grinder is a K-ultra, starting at 7 for small brews and 7.5 for large ones.

But‚Ä¶CW: poop..





.
.
.
.
.

I‚Äôm a very regular person, by 8:30 AM, after my standard three cups of black coffee.

I cannot drink coffee within 3 hours of running due to the three children I‚Äôve popped out and my dubious pelvic floor. I also did a bunch of hydration the day before but not so much morning of due to said pelvic floor (yeah yeah, I work on it..).

Therefore, I could not poop before yesterday‚Äôs 7:45 start time HM. By mile 3 I experienced some rectal discomfort and by mile 8 I slipped into a port o potty, only to find myself  barely able to squeeze out a small amount of stool that had clearly turned milkshake consistency due to running. An emptying poop was out of the question.

I wasn‚Äôt at risk of pooping myself, but I was uncomfortable and everything would‚Äôve been easier if I could‚Äôve just crapped before my HM. 

Anyone else have a mismatch between poop and race timing? Tips/tricks? My middle kid has a GI condition and I found myself gazing longingly at his pediatric suppositories‚Ä¶",2,1747670346.0,XXRunning,1,1.0,False

I guess I just need to get this out, and I'm hoping yall might understand better than some other subs. TW for grief and relationship issues.

I'm 39/f, recently Dx AuDHD. My dad died in February. He was 81 and not in great health but it was still very sudden and world shifting. I have images I can't get out of my head some days. The grief has been... hard. There are no words, really. And on top of that, I'm pretty much the only one here for my mom, who's on her own for the first time in 78 years.

I've been struggling since February. I understand now with help from my therapist that I'm in burnout. It's all I can do to get out of bed each day, to bathe, to eat. I'm really only able to do maybe half a day of focused work. I have no patience for anyone or anything. I don't enjoy things I used to enjoy. My body hurts all the time. Grief is its own kind of work and it is exhausting.

My husband was supportive during my dad's passing, the funeral, and for about two weeks or so afterwards. But he also took on a massive job in February (we run our own small business) that took all of his focus and energy. He started taking adderall, as he was Dx with ADHD not long ago himself. The dosage was too strong but he stayed on it for a month. He was strung out, living almost entirely on black coffee and adderall, and worked from about 8:30am to 2am every day with few breaks. To say he was emotionally unavailable is an understatement. He took his stress out on me, was constantly critical and demanding, all while knowing full well the mental state I was in.

He quickly ran out of patience with me. He has told me that I'm drain on both him and the company. He said his therapist told him he needed to start ""protecting himself because of how much he compensates for me."" When I asked him how he has to ""compensate"" for me, because I couldn't even get him to stop piling on much less emotionally support me, he said that it was his thoughts and I didn't have the capacity to understand.

I go into daily meltdowns at this point from interactions with him. He'll help me in practical ways but he offers no grace, comfort, patience, safety, or softness for me. I feel like I'm being kicked while I'm down. Nothing I do is good enough or fast enough. If I have a feeling he doesn't like, I'm berated for expressing it. 

We have been fighting since yesterday morning and I am just wrung out and done. He begged me to stay and try to work on things with him yesterday, but when I expressed my feelings (basically what I've written here) he said I'd already made my mind up and there was nothing he could do. Basically put it all on me that I'm choosing to walk away while he did everything he could.

My family doesn't understand my AuDHD, my queerness, or my worldview. I have love there but not real support or understanding. I don't have any friends. So the thought of leaving my only safe space in the world and my only familiar comforts is terrifying me rn. I'm spiraling. I don't know what to do. I'm scared to lose the only security I have, but I don't think I can take much more of this. Thanks for reading.",2,1747670127.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

1kqf5fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kqf5fo/went_to_the_gold_coast_for_a_job_interview_and/,Went to the Gold Coast for a job interview‚Ä¶ and ended up in a rom-com I didn‚Äôt ask for (but lowkey needed),"I just got back from a solo trip to the Gold Coast and Brisbane, and I‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around everything that happened. Originally, I flew up from Melbourne for a two-day job interview. It was supposed to be in-and-out maybe chill a bit, grab some sun, then fly home.

But life had other plans. What I got instead was five days of chaos, warmth, and the kind of flirt-energy I never get in Melbourne. Like‚Ä¶ was I suddenly main character coded?

Day 1: Interview + Mean Receptionist + The Tinder Twist
After my interview on the 15th, I checked into a pretty nice hotel. The next morning, I went looking for the buffet breakfast and couldn‚Äôt find it. Literally, for two days, I failed to locate it. So finally, I asked the front desk. The blonde receptionist there (you know the type: platinum hair, blue eyes, icy tone) answered me with the most passive-aggressive energy I‚Äôve ever met.

She rapid-fired directions I couldn‚Äôt follow, then said, ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs 10:20, so you probably won‚Äôt eat anyway.‚Äù I asked for a refund for the breakfast I never got, and she said no it‚Äôs ‚Äúpart of your package.‚Äù I left feeling annoyed, hungry, and kinda humiliated.

I wrote a complaint email and went to check out. That‚Äôs when the duty manager appeared.

And‚Ä¶ plot twist: this man looked like he walked straight out of a Pinterest board. Tall, sharp jawline, kind eyes just effortlessly handsome. He apologized sincerely, bought me a coffee and sandwich, and said, ‚ÄúNext time you‚Äôre in town, message me directly. I‚Äôll upgrade your room.‚Äù I was like: sir???

But wait. That night, I opened Tinder‚Ä¶
We had matched.
Before I even filed the complaint.
And he had messaged me first: ‚ÄúHey, how‚Äôs your weekend going?‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt replied. And I don‚Äôt know if he knows. But the plot‚Ä¶ thickened.

Day 2: Brazilian Uber Driver Energy
I changed hotels that evening and my Uber driver? Ridiculously hot Brazilian guy. The vibe in the car was instantly flirty. As I got out, he gave me his number and said, ‚ÄúIf you need a ride to Brisbane tomorrow, I‚Äôll take care of you.‚Äù We‚Äôre still in contact. The tension? Yeah, it was there.

Also Day 2: Teppanyaki Chef Situation
Later that night, I went to dinner with a friend. The chef doing the teppanyaki show? My literal type ‚Äî tattoos, build, a little tan, probably mixed Filipino. He drew a heart on the grill with sauce and said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in this playful way.

So I asked for his number.
He gave it.
We texted. If I wasn‚Äôt leaving early the next morning, I think something could‚Äôve happened.

Day 3: Enter the Taiwanese Guy
I needed a ride to Brisbane, and trains weren‚Äôt running. I found a guy on Rednote Taiwanese, super chill. He offered to drive me up. We vibed the whole ride. I tried to give him gas money, he refused. I bought him lunch. That Uber would‚Äôve cost me $100+, and this man just wanted good conversation and good food. Respect.

Day 4: UQ Student & Unexpected Confession
In Brisbane, I met another guy from Red who showed me around University of Queensland, took me out for dinner, and then the next morning ‚Äî helped me check out, brought me to brunch by the water, took me gift shopping, and dropped me at the airport.

On the way there, he said something I still think about:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my type. Physically and energy-wise. But I‚Äôm not going to make a move. I‚Äôm grown now. I just admire beauty and leave it be.‚Äù
What???

So now I‚Äôm back in cold, grey Melbourne, wondering what just happened.

I‚Äôve lived here for years. Never ‚Äî and I mean NEVER ‚Äî have I experienced that much attention, kindness, and flirtation. But in Queensland? It was like I unlocked a whole new dimension. People were kind. Present. Playful. And I felt‚Ä¶ seen.

So now I‚Äôm asking:

Was it the vibe I gave off?
Was it the off-season beach energy?
Was it just a string of coincidences and kind-hearted strangers?

Or maybe was I just finally aligned with the universe?

I‚Äôm taking my will-be 11 year old daughter for a day in Cleveland for her birthday in August. We‚Äôre going to go by 27 club coffee (bc obviously she loves pink, poppunk, and MGK) and manicures at Paint, and ending the night with Disney‚Äôs Descendants/Zombies concert at rocket arena. 

SO MY ASK: she has a rare dietary thing called PKU, she can only eat 12g protein into a day. Gluten free pastas don‚Äôt cut it because they add protein into them. She has spaghetti noodles that come packaged from the company we buy them from. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows of any type of restaurant that would cook these for her. They don‚Äôt need anything special, just boiled and salt and butter. Or would let me bring them with us for her to eat, while I buy something. Normally we just order her fries everywhere we go, and we could do that this time too‚Äî I‚Äôd probably opt for somewhere gluten free then. But I didn‚Äôt know if there was some off chance somewhere on her was a chef, cook, owner, had some thoughts on this and being able to actually take her to dinner somewhere. 

I have a backup plan if it‚Äôs not doable and I‚Äôm going to put in the work to call some places. We used to live in Columbus and every now and places would do it once I explained the situation. We live in Akron now and don‚Äôt go many places!

I know the answer is most likely ""nothing"" (or the classic ""have you tried exercise/healing stones/yoga/essential oils/etc""). I'm just grieving, I suppose.

Modafinil, Ritalin, Vyvanse, caffeine. 98% of the time, they have little to no effect. Not only that, but they also have given me unbearable side effects as well. 

I once drank 10 cups of coffee in a day and still had to desperately go lay down and sleep.

At this point, I believe that even if I snorted cocaine, injected an energy drink into my veins, drank 100 shots of espresso, ate raw coffee beans, then swallowed 100x maximum dosage of ritalin and vyvanse, I would still immediately go take a nap afterwards.

It's not tolerance either, because I've tried quitting all sorts of stimulants for a long time and it's all the same.

In the past, caffeine would help a little bit. Actually, if I took too much, I would get quite jittery and anxious. I started drinking at 12 years old because I kept passing out in class (in fact, my pediatrician was the one who told me to do so, rather than investigating the root cause further). 

Now? Nothing. I just keep deteriorating. Frankly, I would be elated to lend my body to be studied.

Originally, I flew up from Melbourne for a two-day job interview. It was supposed to be in-and-out ‚Äî maybe chill a bit, grab some sun, then fly home.

But life had other plans. What I got instead was five days of chaos, warmth, and the kind of flirt-energy I never get in Melbourne. Like‚Ä¶ was I suddenly main character coded?

Day 1: Interview + Mean Receptionist + The Tinder Twist
After my interview on the 15th, I checked into a pretty nice hotel. The next morning, I went looking for the buffet breakfast ‚Äî and couldn‚Äôt find it. Literally, for two days, I failed to locate it. So finally, I asked the front desk. The blonde receptionist there (you know the type: platinum hair, blue eyes, icy tone) answered me with the most passive-aggressive energy I‚Äôve ever met.

She rapid-fired directions I couldn‚Äôt follow, then said, ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs 10:20, so you probably won‚Äôt eat anyway.‚Äù I asked for a refund for the breakfast I never got, and she said no ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Äúpart of your package.‚Äù I left feeling annoyed, hungry, and kinda humiliated.

I wrote a complaint email and went to check out. That‚Äôs when the duty manager appeared.

And‚Ä¶ plot twist: this man looked like he walked straight out of a Pinterest board. Tall, sharp jawline, kind eyes ‚Äî just effortlessly handsome. He apologized sincerely, bought me a coffee and sandwich, and said, ‚ÄúNext time you‚Äôre in town, message me directly. I‚Äôll upgrade your room.‚Äù I was like: sir???

But wait. That night, I opened Tinder‚Ä¶
We had matched.
Before I even filed the complaint.
And he had messaged me first: ‚ÄúHey, how‚Äôs your weekend going?‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt replied. And I don‚Äôt know if he knows. But the plot‚Ä¶ thickened.

Day 2: Brazilian Uber Driver Energy
I changed hotels that evening and my Uber driver? Ridiculously hot Brazilian guy. The vibe in the car was instantly flirty. As I got out, he gave me his number and said, ‚ÄúIf you need a ride to Brisbane tomorrow, I‚Äôll take care of you.‚Äù We‚Äôre still in contact. The tension? Yeah, it was there.

Also Day 2: Teppanyaki Chef Situation
Later that night, I went to dinner with a friend. The chef doing the teppanyaki show? My literal type ‚Äî tattoos, build, a little tan, probably mixed Filipino. He drew a heart on the grill with sauce and said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù in this playful way.

So I asked for his number.
He gave it.
We texted. If I wasn‚Äôt leaving early the next morning, I think something could‚Äôve happened.

Day 3: Enter the Taiwanese Guy
I needed a ride to Brisbane, and trains weren‚Äôt running. I found a guy on Red (Chinese social app) ‚Äî Taiwanese, super chill. He offered to drive me up. We vibed the whole ride. I tried to give him gas money, he refused. I bought him lunch. That Uber would‚Äôve cost me $100+, and this man just wanted good conversation and good food. Respect.

Day 4: UQ Student & Unexpected Confession
In Brisbane, I met another guy from Red who showed me around University of Queensland, took me out for dinner, and then ‚Äî the next morning ‚Äî helped me check out, brought me to brunch by the water, took me gift shopping, and dropped me at the airport.

On the way there, he said something I still think about:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my type. Physically and energy-wise. But I‚Äôm not going to make a move. I‚Äôm grown now. I just admire beauty and leave it be.‚Äù
What???

So now I‚Äôm back in cold, grey Melbourne, wondering what just happened.

I‚Äôve lived here for years. Never ‚Äî and I mean NEVER ‚Äî have I experienced that much attention, kindness, and flirtation. But in Queensland? It was like I unlocked a whole new dimension. People were kind. Present. Playful. And I felt‚Ä¶ seen.

So now I‚Äôm asking:

Was it the vibe I gave off?
Was it the off-season beach energy?
Was it just a string of coincidences and kind-hearted strangers?

Things like taxes and tuition for the kids, not to mention therapy bills. I've been selling my things when necessary to pay these bills. 

At the same time, every day, Amazon delivers something. Something that struck my wife's fancy. Not to mention that, going through our bank statements for the last 90 days, she has spent $3000 on tattoos, not to mention $4000 on Amazon in the last 6 months. 

Meanwhile, she has chided me about my spending and complained that her credit card is maxed out. 

I scrimped and saved for 2 months to take her on a weekend getaway to a local spa resort. I work from home so I'm not spending money on gas, parking, or eating out at restaurants other than eating my kids leftovers from Chik Fil-a. My weekly treat is a medium coffee from Dunkin, which I get on Saturdays when I buy a couple of donuts for the kids. I haven't gone to a movie theater in over a year. 

My wife has self-esteem problems and telling her that her spending is driving us deep into debt just makes things worse as I think she's shopping to get a dopamine hit. I've tried to be diplomatic about it - ""Hey, uh, honey. We've got a whole lot of bills. Like we need to pay for the girls Sunday school and camp. Can you maybe try to hold off on all the tattoos and things like that?""

A few gems:

- Cursor: AI-first code editor that *gets* your codebase. Like Copilot‚Äôs nerdy cousin that actually understands you.
- Supabase: Firebase but make it open-source and less ‚ÄúGoogle owns your soul.‚Äù
- PostHog: Analytics that you can self-host, for all you ""keep my data on my own damn server"" types.
- Railway: Effortless app deployment. Honestly feels illegal how easy it is.
- Fireflies AI: Meeting notes without listening to Jeff talk for 45 minutes? Yes please.
- Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini: Battle of the AI chat gods‚Äîwhose side are you on?
- Copy.ai & Taskade: For when content needs to happen but your coffee hasn't kicked in.

Everything has a free tier (ish), so I‚Äôm curious‚Äîanyone here tried building something real with these? Stuff that shipped? Or are we all just hoarding logins and testing APIs at 2am with no context?

Also‚Ä¶ Bubble. No-code apps. Genius or gateway drug to spaghetti UX?

Would love to hear what tools you're actually using and if any of them replaced full teams for you.

My home is now ruled by **two Sphynxes** ‚Äî one male and one female. If you‚Äôve also found yourself living with two tiny bald goblins that alternate between purring cuddle monsters and hyper parkour demons, this guide‚Äôs for you.

**1. Double the cats = double the bath schedule**  
Sphynxes get oily and dirty faster than furry cats, and with *two*, it gets real.  
üîπ Aim to bathe each cat every 7‚Äì10 days.  
üîπ Use gentle, unscented cat-safe or baby shampoo.  
üîπ Bathe them separately unless they‚Äôre weirdly chill about it.  
üîπ Dry them thoroughly and keep them warm after!

**2. Clean their ears weekly (and individually)**  
Both cats will get wax buildup in their ears ‚Äî even more so if they groom each other.  
üîπ Use cotton pads and ear cleaner or warm water.  
üîπ One cat might have more buildup than the other ‚Äî clean accordingly.  
üîπ Never use Q-tips deep in the ear canal.

**3. Wipe-downs between baths are essential**  
If they start feeling sticky or leaving oil marks on furniture:  
üîπ Use alcohol-free pet wipes or a soft damp cloth.  
üîπ Focus on armpits, neck folds, belly, and tail base.

**4. Trim nails & clean paws regularly**  
Double cats = double claws and double toe gunk.  
üîπ Trim claws every 1‚Äì2 weeks.  
üîπ Wipe between paw pads to prevent greasy buildup.

**5. Warmth is a priority**  
Sphynxes are always seeking heat ‚Äî now times two.  
üîπ Set up heated beds or cozy spots with blankets.  
üîπ Consider light cat clothes if your place gets cold.  
üîπ Expect both to pile on top of you for warmth. Personal space? Gone.

**6. Watch the sun exposure**  
They‚Äôll sunbathe any chance they get ‚Äî but their naked skin burns fast.  
üîπ Keep them out of harsh direct sunlight.  
üîπ Use UV-filter window film if needed.  
üîπ No sunscreen ‚Äî just keep them shaded.

**7. Diet affects skin & energy**  
Sphynxes burn more calories (no fur + active), and what they eat shows on their skin.  
üîπ Feed high-quality food ‚Äî possibly grain-free or vet-recommended.  
üîπ Monitor for skin issues or allergies, especially if they eat differently.  
üîπ Make sure both drink enough water.

**8. Expect constant attention-seeking (from both)**  
These cats are *needy*, intelligent, and social.  
üîπ Be prepared for synchronized zoomies.  
üîπ They‚Äôll want to be involved in *everything*.  
üîπ You are now the center of their universe ‚Äî times two.

**Bonus: Be ready for chaos and cuddles**  
They‚Äôll wrestle, groom each other, steal your blanket, and knock over your coffee. But also nap curled up like a yin-yang of wrinkly love.

Happy to answer questions or swap Sphynx stories ‚Äî fellow hairless pet parents, how are *you* holding up?

Sometimes I think about the little things that shaped me more than I realized.

When I was a little girl, we lived close to my mom‚Äôs parents ‚Äî just a short dirt road walk away. We didn‚Äôt stay there long, maybe a year. But every summer morning, my brother and I would run barefoot down that road to Gramma and Grandpa‚Äôs. Not to win anything ‚Äî just to get there first. The pancakes were waiting.

We‚Äôd slip through the back porch screen door and onto the black and white tiled kitchen floor. Grandpa would be sitting with his coffee and saucer (he always poured his coffee into the saucer to drink it), and Gramma would be flippin‚Äô pancakes at the stove.

There was always a big stack on the table.  
We‚Äôd hover, and she‚Äôd say,  
‚ÄúYa‚Äôll wait until your Grandpa‚Äôs had his fill. Then you can have what‚Äôs left.‚Äù

Grandpa would finish, place his cap on his head, pat us both, and say,  
‚ÄúNow you fellers be good today.‚Äù  
Then he‚Äôd leave.

And Gramma would say,  
‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ you can have what‚Äôs left.‚Äù  
There was *always* enough left.

I never sat down. I never used syrup. I just grabbed a pancake and ate it standing there.

I didn‚Äôt realize until much later in life  
what that plate meant ‚Äî  
how it never ran out,  
how even when we had to wait,  
there was *always something left.*

Gramma made sure of that.

It wasn‚Äôt about food.  
It was about love.

Chapter One:

The first bell echoed down the long, sunlit hallways of Gallatin High School, mingling with the scrape of lockers and the chatter of students easing into another day. Eric Dandasan shuffled into the building, his backpack slung low over one shoulder, eyes half-lidded against the bright Montana morning.

He passed clusters of kids swapping weekend stories, the scent of pine cleaner and cafeteria coffee hanging in the air. His own thoughts felt heavy, clouded by the dull throb behind his temples that had started the day before‚Äîand stubbornly refused to fade.

‚ÄúHey, Eric!‚Äù someone called.

Jamie, from his history class, waved near the lockers. She had that easy, magnetic grin that made the crowded halls feel a little less chaotic.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Eric replied, forcing a nod as he fell into step beside her.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Jamie said as they turned the corner, ‚Äúready for Alden‚Äôs quiz tomorrow?‚Äù

Eric shrugged, rubbing the side of his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm gonna make it through today without passing out.‚Äù

Jamie gave him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúRough weekend?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really. Just this headache that won‚Äôt quit.‚Äù

‚ÄúSkipped breakfast again?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù He tried to keep his tone light, but even his voice felt tired.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, nudging him with her elbow, ‚Äúif you need to copy my notes later, just say the word.‚Äù

He gave a faint smile. ‚ÄúThanks. I might.‚Äù

The clock above the main entrance chimed again. They reached the door to Mr. Alden‚Äôs classroom, the low murmur of voices spilling out into the hall.

Jamie shot him a look. ‚ÄúJust survive until lunch.‚Äù

Eric nodded, touching the worn leather strap of his grandfather‚Äôs old watch‚Äîa small comfort in the swirl of movement and noise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try.‚Äù

They stepped inside.

Scene Two: Algebra

The bell rang sharply, signaling the end of history class. Mr. Alden‚Äôs voice faded as students shuffled out, their footsteps echoing down the linoleum halls. Eric packed his notebook slowly, rubbing his temples where the dull ache had been creeping all morning.

‚ÄúSee you later, Eric,‚Äù Jamie called from the doorway, already laughing with a group of friends.

‚ÄúLater,‚Äù he muttered, forcing a smile.

The hallway buzzed with the usual midday energy‚Äîlockers slamming, students laughing and weaving through crowds. Eric‚Äôs vision wavered for a moment as a sharper pulse throbbed behind his eyes.

He gripped the edge of his locker for balance, blinking hard to clear the fog.

‚ÄúHey, you okay?‚Äù a voice asked.

Eric looked up to see Jamie approaching again, concern knitting her brow.

‚ÄúJust a headache,‚Äù he said, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been bugging me all day.‚Äù

Jamie didn‚Äôt look convinced but nodded. ‚ÄúYou should take it easy. Maybe hit the nurse if it gets worse.‚Äù

Eric shrugged, closing his locker. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

They walked in silence for a few seconds before Eric added, ‚ÄúThanks, though.‚Äù

Jamie gave a light nudge with her shoulder. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt pass out in Algebra. That class is brutal enough without someone face-planting in the middle of it.‚Äù

Eric managed a quiet laugh. ‚ÄúNo promises.‚Äù

The bell rang again, and they slipped into their seats just as Ms. Carter began handing out worksheets. Her sharp eyes moved across the room, daring anyone to be unprepared.

Eric‚Äôs pencil hovered over the worksheet, but the numbers swam in front of his eyes. Ms. Carter‚Äôs voice droned on about factoring quadratic equations, but it barely registered.

He pressed his fingers to his temples again, trying to ease the pressure. The headache had sharpened into a steady throb, and now a faint metallic taste crept into his mouth.

The room felt warmer than usual. He glanced around‚Äîstudents were busy, some tapping pencils, others whispering answers. The fluorescent lights above flickered once, briefly casting the room in a sickly hue.

Jamie caught his eye and gave him a small, encouraging smile. Eric tried to return it but felt a sudden wave of nausea. He shifted in his seat, careful not to draw attention.

‚ÄúEric?‚Äù Ms. Carter‚Äôs voice cut through the fog. ‚ÄúAre you feeling alright?‚Äù

He blinked rapidly, swallowing hard. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù he whispered, though the words felt heavy.

The throbbing behind his eyes pulsed faster, and he squeezed them shut for a moment, willing the pain away.

A sharp prickling sensation started at the back of his neck, crawling upward like tiny ants.

He opened his eyes just as a small drop of blood escaped his left nostril.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he murmured, reaching up to dab it quickly with a tissue.

Ms. Carter‚Äôs brows knitted together with concern as she approached. ‚ÄúEric, maybe you should see the nurse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be okay,‚Äù he insisted, but his voice betrayed him‚Äîshaky and weak.

Jamie stood, moving to his side. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs get you out of here.‚Äù

Eric hesitated but nodded, feeling the room tilt slightly as he stood.

The bell rang, signaling the end of class.

As they walked down the hall, Eric fought the urge to sit down right then and there.

Outside the classroom, the chatter of students faded into a low hum. He took a deep breath of the cool hallway air, the sharp sting in his nose lingering.

Jamie glanced at him, eyes wide. ‚ÄúYou really should‚Äôve told me sooner.‚Äù

Eric shook his head, trying to steady himself. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of it.‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs okay to slow down, Eric.‚Äù

He wanted to believe her.

The lunch bell blared and the hallway filled like a busted dam. Eric kept to the edges, skirting groups of students laughing too loud and moving too fast.

He wasn‚Äôt hungry. The ache in his head had spread‚Äîdull pressure behind his eyes and a weird stiffness in his neck. Like he was holding himself up wrong.

Jamie had peeled off after Algebra with a quick, ‚ÄúSee you later,‚Äù and he hadn‚Äôt tried to follow. The cafeteria was too loud anyway, too bright. Instead, he drifted outside to a low stone wall behind the school commons, where the breeze still carried some of the morning‚Äôs chill.

From here, he could see the ridge lines in the distance, snow clinging to their shaded crests. Below them, half-built neighborhoods sprawled over what used to be his grandfather‚Äôs grazing fields. He used to ride out there on weekends with his dad before the land was sold off, one acre at a time.

Eric pulled out his phone and stared at the black screen, forgetting why he‚Äôd taken it out in the first place. He blinked. The pressure in his temples was sharp now, as if something inside his skull was expanding, just slightly‚Äîjust enough to make him dizzy.

A strange memory surfaced. Not a real one‚Äîat least, it couldn‚Äôt be. He saw himself standing at the edge of a burning building, the smell of smoke thick in the air, sirens wailing. His hands were shaking.

Then it was gone.

He blinked again and looked around. The courtyard was just as it had been: noisy, teenagers moving in packs, football spiraling through the air. Nothing was on fire. His hands were fine.

But for a moment, he wasn‚Äôt sure.

He sat still for the rest of lunch, the sounds around him muffled, his body heavy. Something was off. He didn‚Äôt know what.

But it was getting harder to ignore.

Eric sat at the table in the library, the fluorescent lights above humming faintly, mixing with the soft rustle of pages and the occasional click of a keyboard. The monitor in front of him glowed dimly with a half-read Wikipedia article: Annexation of Texas. The text blurred slightly as he stared at it, unfocused.

He rubbed his temples with both hands. ‚ÄúDammit,‚Äù he muttered under his breath, reaching for his backpack and fishing out a half-empty bottle of Advil.

As he unscrewed the cap, something caught his eye‚Äîthe portrait of George Washington hanging above the bookshelf. It looked‚Ä¶ wrong. The colors seemed too vivid, the eyes a little too watchful. Almost like the old man in the frame was studying him back.

Eric blinked and looked away, brushing it off. He shook two pills into his hand and popped them into his mouth, swallowing dry.

‚ÄúEric Dandasan!‚Äù a sharp voice cracked through the quiet.

He turned to see Mrs. Halvers, the school librarian, approaching with a disapproving glare and a cardigan pulled tight over her shoulders. ‚ÄúWhat did you just put in your mouth?‚Äù

Eric sat up straighter. ‚ÄúJust Advil, ma‚Äôam. I‚Äôve got a headache.‚Äù

She stopped a few feet from his table, arms crossed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre aware of the school‚Äôs medication policy. Hand them over.‚Äù

Eric hesitated, brow furrowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Äî‚Äù

And then it hit.

The pain wasn‚Äôt just behind his eyes anymore‚Äîit was inside them. A sudden pressure, sharp and electric, like something was trying to burst out from behind his forehead.

He gasped, gripping the edge of the table. Everything around him‚Äîthe shelves, the portrait, Mrs. Halvers‚Äîwavered.

And then he heard it.

Screaming.

Not in the library.

In his head.

‚ÄúERIC!‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice called out, desperate and terrified.

Fire. Blinding and furious. Smoke curled around him. Heat pressed against his face. The smell of burning plastic and scorched wood flooded his senses. Someone was calling his name from the flames.

‚ÄúERIC!‚Äù

His hands were shaking, and he couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt speak.

He blinked‚Äî

And the fire was gone.

So was the library.

He was sitting at a different desk now. Cooler air. A flickering projector cast diagrams on the whiteboard‚Äîlabeled organs and vascular systems.

Laughter rippled around him.

His heart hammered in his chest.

‚ÄúEric,‚Äù came another voice, annoyed now. ‚ÄúI asked you a question.‚Äù

He turned, confused, and saw Mrs. Carson standing beside his desk, arms folded. The classroom around him came into focus. Biology. Fifth period.

What the hell?

‚ÄúMrs. Carson‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice was dry. ‚ÄúMay I‚Ä¶ may I be excused?‚Äù

She frowned, studying his face. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look well. Yes. Go.‚Äù

Eric stood on legs that didn‚Äôt feel like his. The bell hadn‚Äôt rung. He‚Äôd missed time‚Äîninety minutes at least.

Eric stepped out into the hallway, the noise of the classroom fading behind him. The air felt colder here, and for a moment, he was just standing still, trying to catch his breath.

He looked down at his hands‚Äîslightly trembling. The lingering heat of that impossible fire still burned somewhere inside his mind, even though the hallway was quiet, empty.

He should feel relief. Instead, something tightened inside his chest. He didn‚Äôt belong here‚Äînot really.

He started walking, the dull headache now pulsing steadily. The school corridors stretched on, long and lifeless 

Eric arrived at the nurse‚Äôs office, a place he had never actually been before. The walls were pale and sterile, the scent of disinfectant hanging faintly in the air.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù the nurse asked, looking up from her clipboard.

‚ÄúYeah, um‚Ä¶ my head,‚Äù Eric said, pressing a palm to his temple. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a headache.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, lay down,‚Äù she said, motioning to the small cot tucked into the corner of the room.

Eric settled onto it, the paper sheet crinkling beneath him. The nurse moved beside him, gently wrapping a blood pressure cuff around his arm and checking his vitals‚Äîmore out of protocol than concern. Everything read normal.

She gave a small sigh and a polite smile, likely chalking it up to another student looking for a break from class.

‚ÄúOkay, get some rest,‚Äù she said, jotting something down on her clipboard. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll inform your teachers. What‚Äôs your name, hon?‚Äù 

""Eric, ma'am. Eric Dandasan,"" he answered, his voice still groggy.

The nurse jotted it down on her clipboard. ""Alright, Eric. Just get some rest, dear,"" she said with a gentle smile.

Eric lay back on the cot, the room spinning slightly as he settled in. The sterile scent of rubbing alcohol and faint hum of fluorescent lights faded into the background. Before long, his eyes fluttered closed.

The sound of the final bell jolted him awake.

Eric sat up slowly, disoriented. ""How long was I asleep?""

""Just a few hours, dear,"" the nurse replied, straightening the papers on her desk. ""That was the final bell. Think you can make it home, or should I call your parents?""

He rubbed his eyes and nodded. ""I think I‚Äôll be okay.""

Gathering his things, Eric stepped out of the nurse‚Äôs office and into the now-quiet hallway. A faint ache still pulsed at his temples. He moved slowly to his locker, the echo of his footsteps oddly sharp in the emptiness.

Opening it, he began switching out books, grabbing his backpack and slipping it over one shoulder. A wave of nausea hit him out of nowhere, forcing him to pause, one hand gripping the locker door for balance. He closed his eyes and waited for it to pass.

Maybe he should call his mom for a ride.

He pulled out his phone, thumb hovering over the screen‚Ä¶ but after a moment, he slid it back into his pocket. His father wouldn‚Äôt approve. He‚Äôd say the walk would do him good.

With a resigned breath, Eric shut the locker and turned toward the front doors, steeling himself for the twenty-minute walk home‚Äîeach step feeling just a little heavier than the last.

(Part 2)","""It's different this year."" She handed me a small vial. ""Iron filings dissolved in salt water. Mark your doorway and windows tonight.""

""What about the campers? Jesse and the others?""

""We can't save everyone,"" she said sharply, then softened. ""Not yet. But if we can get Tyler back, prove this can be reversed... maybe we can return with help.""

I pocketed the vial. ""Hank showed me the lake boundaries. Something came up from the water.""

Dani's hands stilled. ""Did it see you watching?""

When I nodded, she cursed. ""They'll come for you tonight. The swimmers always collect witnesses. That's why there's a rule against it.""

""There's no such rule in the book.""

""It's newer. Added after Tyler."" She resumed packing. ""They update the rules whenever someone gets taken. Each rule marks a specific loss.""

On my way back, I passed the camp store. A light burned late. Through the window, I saw Eliza and Hank by the open glass cabinet. Hank examined Tyler's watch under a small light; Eliza consulted an old, leather-bound book.

I ducked out of sight, reaching my cabin. I carefully applied the iron-salt mixture to my threshold and window frames. As it dried, faint silvery traces appeared, visible only at certain angles.

Sleep eluded me. Around 2 AM, soft tapping began at my window‚Äîlight, rhythmic, too precise for rain. I kept my eyes shut tight, remembering Hank's warning. The tapping grew insistent, then stopped. Abruptly.

Then, a new sound: the mechanical whirr-click of a camera shutter. Followed by my brother's voice.

""Nate. I got you something. Open your eyes.""

My body tensed beneath the covers, sweat beading.

""I acknowledge but decline,"" I whispered, recalling Rule 3.

Splintering wood came from the roof, then scratching along the walls. Something heavy dropped onto my porch with a thud. I risked opening my eyes. A dark silhouette pressed against the window‚Äîhumanoid, but wrong. Its head branched into antler-like protrusions. The silver traces on the frame glowed faintly where it touched.

""Little brother,"" it said in Tyler's voice, distorted as if speaking through water. ""You came to find me. Now let me in.""

I remained silent, clutching the leather notebook under my pillow.

The thing outside tapped the glass with what looked like a camera‚ÄîTyler's missing camera. ""I have proof now. Of what lives out there. Let me show you.""

When I didn't respond, it pressed harder. The glass creaked. The silver traces flared brighter, and the creature hissed, pulling back its hand as if burned.

""You've been talking to the Martin girl,"" it said, voice twisted with anger. ""She'll get you killed like she got your brother killed.""

The accusation made me sit up. ""What do you mean?""

A mistake‚Äîacknowledging it, engaging.

Its face pressed against the glass, features shifting, blurring like wax. ""She told him how to cross safely. She lied."" Its mouth stretched into a grin too wide. ""She wanted him to become a door. For her brother. But the rules don't work that way. We don't work that way.""

A distant horn blasted three times‚Äîthe signal to remain indoors. The creature's head jerked toward the sound.

""Two nights,"" it said, backing away. ""Two nights until the moon is full. Will you be ready to see what's on the other side?""

It melted into darkness. Minutes later, screams echoed from a camper cabin.

Morning revealed Pine Cabin had lost another member‚Äîa boy who ""received an emergency call."" The remaining campers looked shaken, especially the sensitives, who huddled together, whispering.

Jesse approached me by the lake. ""It took Kevin last night,"" he said. ""We all saw it. Something pulled him right through the wall like mist.""

""Did you tell anyone?""

""Staff know. They're lying to keep everyone calm, but the sensitives felt it. The boundaries are thinning faster.""

That afternoon, Eliza announced a moonlight hike for the following evening‚Äî""to observe nocturnal wildlife."" Creek Cabin and three others were selected. All contained campers on the ""high sensitivity"" list.

""It's happening tomorrow, not during the full moon,"" I told Dani during dinner prep. ""They're taking the sensitives into the woods.""

""That breaks their pattern,"" she said, alarmed. ""Something's wrong. The boundaries must be weakening faster than they expected.""

""We move tonight then,"" I decided. ""I'll create a distraction at the campfire. You grab Tyler's watch from the cabinet.""

""And then?""

""We take it beyond the boundary stones, where Tyler disappeared."" I showed her the coordinates from his notes. ""Tonight. While we still can.""

As dusk fell, campers gathered. Eliza and senior staff exchanged concerned glances, counting heads. Seventy-seven remained where eighty had arrived. The forest was feeding earlier.

Across the fire, Jesse caught my eye, showing his notebook: THEY'RE COMING THROUGH TONIGHT. NOT WAITING FOR MOON.

Above, clouds revealed a moon, heavy and swollen, close to full. Its light painted the lake silver, illuminating movement beneath the surface‚Äîripples spreading toward shore.

The boundary stones along the waterline glowed faintly, pulsing as something pressed against the rules holding them.

The campfire program ended abruptly when fog rolled in from the lake‚Äîthick, gray wisps slithering across the ground like searching fingers. Eliza ordered campers back to cabins. This wasn't normal fog; it moved with purpose, curling around ankles.

""Keep them inside,"" Eliza instructed staff. ""Salt lines across every door and window. No one opens up, no matter what they hear.""

As Creek Cabin's counselor, I escorted my group back. Jesse lagged behind, whispering to the other sensitives. Inside, campers prepared for bed, though few seemed inclined toward sleep. Fear ran through the room.

""It's coming from the lake,"" whispered Mia, a sensitive camper. ""They're swimming to shore.""

""Who is?"" another asked.

""The ones who were here before,"" Jesse answered. ""Before the camp. Before the stones. Before people.""

I checked my watch: 9:47 PM. I needed a distraction soon. Through the window, staff reinforced boundary stones, flashlight beams cutting fog.

""Everyone stay here,"" I instructed. ""I need to check in with the head counselor. Jesse's in charge.""

He met my eyes, a silent understanding. ""We'll maintain the salt lines,"" he said, holding his pouch.

Outside, the air hung heavy with moisture and a coppery smell. Counselors hurried between buildings, carrying boundary mixture. Hank directed a team reinforcing stones by the sports field.

I ducked behind the dining hall, circling to the boathouse where Dani waited with backpacks.

""Change of plans,"" she said. ""They've moved the cabinet contents.""

""What? Where?""

""Eliza's office. Preparing them for tomorrow's ritual."" She handed me a crowbar. ""We need to break in, now.""

""The distraction‚Äî""

""Nature provided one."" She gestured to the fog pouring onshore. ""Everyone's focused on securing boundaries. It's now or never.""

We crept toward the main lodge, keeping to shadows. Most lights were off, but a dim glow came from Eliza's office. Peering inside, the room was empty. On her desk sat a wooden box with iron fittings‚Äînothing like the glass cabinet.

""Back door,"" Dani whispered, leading me around. The lock was old; the crowbar made quick work of it. We slipped inside, navigating dark hallways to the office.

The wooden box felt warm, almost alive. Its iron lock bore symbols matching the boundary stones.

""Can you open it?"" I asked.

Dani produced a vial‚Äîthe same iron-salt solution. ""Tyler figured this out. The lock isn't mechanical; it's a ward."" She poured liquid into the keyhole. The metal sizzled, then clicked open.

Inside lay eight items, each in velvet: a baseball cap, a friendship bracelet, a Walkman, a Swiss Army knife, a disposable camera, a hair clip, a college ring, and Tyler's watch. Each pulsed with faint blue light, like heartbeats out of sync.

""Grab only Tyler's,"" Dani warned. ""Touching the others could wake their bonds.""

I carefully lifted the watch. It felt unnaturally cold. The second hand still ticked backward.

""Jason's bracelet,"" Dani whispered, fingers hovering. ""I should take it‚Äî""

""One at a time,"" I said, pulling her hand back. ""We get Tyler first, then come back for Jason.""

Shouting outside interrupted us‚Äîstaff gathering on the lawn. Through the glass, I saw Eliza holding a dowsing rod, turning until it jerked sharply toward the lodge. Toward us.

""They know,"" Dani hissed. ""We need to go. Now.""

We fled through the back door as flashlight beams swept the front entrance. Behind us, Eliza's voice: ""The anchors! Check the office!""

Rather than heading for the forest, Dani pulled me toward the boathouse. ""Water crossing,"" she explained. ""They'll expect us by land. The boundary is weaker over water, but so is their tracking.""

We slipped inside, dragged a canoe to the edge. The fog had thickened to wet cotton, limiting visibility. The lake lay preternaturally still, reflecting moonlight like obsidian.

""Stay in the middle,"" Dani instructed as we pushed off. ""Don't touch the water. Don't look directly at anything you see beneath the surface.""

I clutched Tyler's watch, paddle in the other hand, gliding silently. The boundary stones continued underwater, their tops breaking the surface in a line. Each glowed blue, like the anchors.

As we approached the stone line, the water stirred. Dark shapes moved beneath us, circling the boat.

""They're escorting us,"" Dani whispered. ""The swimmers. They know we have an anchor.""

""Is that good or bad?""

""Depends what they want."" She paddled steadily. ""The boundary is just ahead. Once we cross, we'll aim for that cove. The old Beaumont cabin ruins are a quarter mile inland.""

I felt the moment we crossed‚Äîa sensation like cobwebs breaking across my face, followed by a pressure change. The watch grew colder, ticking speeding up.

Beyond the boundary, the forest seemed ancient, trees taller, denser. No blue lights drifted here‚Äîinstead, shadows moved independently, flowing like oil.

We beached the canoe. The moment we stepped onto land, the watch's ticking became audible‚Äîa rapid backward count growing louder with each step away from the lake.

""It's accelerating,"" I said. ""What does that mean?""

""It's closer to its owner."" Dani unhooked a compass. ""This won't work out here, so we follow the watch. The colder it gets, the closer we are.""

We hiked through untouched forest, guided by moonlight. The watch grew steadily colder until it burned against my palm like dry ice. The trees thinned, revealing a clearing where stone foundations marked a long-gone cabin.

In the center stood a crude altar of piled stones. On top sat a vintage camera‚ÄîTyler's missing camera.

""This is where he crossed over,"" Dani whispered.

The watch ticked frantically, hands spinning backward. I approached the altar and placed the watch beside the camera.

""Now what?""

""Now we call him."" Dani's voice took on a formal cadence. ""We have the anchor. We stand beyond the boundary. We call the lost one home.""

She took a deep breath and shouted: ""Tyler Blackwood! Follow your anchor home!""

The forest fell silent‚Äînot a leaf rustled. The watch stopped ticking.

""Tyler Blackwood!"" I called, joining her. ""Follow your anchor!""

A low moan emanated from the trees, as if the forest were in pain. The ground trembled. Shadows between trees elongated, stretching toward the altar.

""It's working,"" Dani breathed.

The air shimmered above the altar, distorting. A figure took shape‚Äîblurry, then solid. Tyler's face formed, but wrong, stretched, twisted. Branches or antlers sprouted from his head; camera lenses reflected moonlight where his eyes should be.

""That's not Tyler,"" I gasped, stepping back.

""It is,"" Dani countered. ""Part of him, at least. The rest is... what took him.""

The figure‚ÄîTyler but not-Tyler‚Äîreached for the watch with elongated fingers. As he touched it, the transformation accelerated. Antler-branches receded, lenses sank into human eyes, stretched features regained human proportions.

""Nate,"" he croaked, voice raw. ""You came.""

""Tyler?"" I stepped closer. ""Is it really you?""

He nodded, the movement practiced. ""Not... all me. But enough."" His gaze shifted to Dani. ""You... you told me it would be safe.""

Dani's expression crumpled. ""I thought it would be. I'm sorry, Tyler.""

A twig snapped behind us. Flashlight beams cut through the trees‚Äîstaff from camp, led by Hank and Eliza.

""Get away from the altar,"" Eliza commanded, voice carrying power. ""You have no idea what you're doing.""

""We're bringing him back,"" I said, standing between them and Tyler.

""You're releasing what's inside him,"" Hank growled. ""The anchor keeps it contained. Removing it breaks the seal.""

Tyler's form flickered, revealing the antlered figure beneath. His hand closed around the watch.

""Too late,"" he said, voice overlaid with something deeper. ""Door's open now.""

The ground shook more violently. From camp, a horn blasted‚Äîone long continuous blast.

""The boundary is collapsing,"" Eliza shouted to her staff. ""Fall back to secondary containment!""

""What's happening?"" I demanded.

""You've destabilized the balance."" Eliza's face twisted with fury and fear. ""Eighty years of careful maintenance, undone in a night.""

Tyler‚Äîor what wore his form‚Äîsmiled. ""August sends his regards, Eliza. He's coming home.""

A thunderous crack echoed across the lake. Blue light flashed from camp, followed by screams.

""The campers,"" I gasped.

""They'll be taken,"" Dani said grimly. ""All of them. That's what happens when the boundary fails completely.""

Tyler extended his hands. ""Come. There's a safe place. Not much time.""

""Don't trust it,"" Hank warned as staff retreated. ""That's not your brother anymore.""

I looked at Tyler‚Äîthe brother I'd come to save‚Äîand saw something ancient looking back. Something that wore his face like a mask.

""What are you?"" I whispered.

""Threshold guardian,"" he replied in Tyler's voice. ""Doorkeeper. The eye that watches between worlds."" He tapped the camera. ""I record what crosses. I judge what passes.""

""And my brother?""

""Part of me now. As I am part of him."" He held out his hand again. ""Choose quickly. The swimmers are coming ashore.""

Time seemed suspended. My brother's hand before me, the collapsing camp behind. From across the lake came chaos: screams, the horn, a deep rumbling.

""What happens if I go with you?"" I asked Tyler, or whatever fraction remained.

""You become like me. A watcher. A keeper."" His expression softened into something more recognizably Tyler. ""It's not death, Nate. It's transformation.""

Dani grabbed my arm. ""We need to decide now.""

Through the trees, I spotted Eliza and staff retreating toward the lake, drawing symbols with boundary mixture. Beyond them, shadows flowed like spilled ink‚Äîliving darkness pursuing them.

""The swimmers have breached the shore,"" Tyler warned. ""They hunger for what they've been denied.""

""The campers,"" I insisted. ""My cabin. Jesse and the others.""

""Some will become doorways. Some will become food."" Tyler's bluntness carried my brother's directness. ""The sensitive ones may survive as watchers, like me. The rest..."" He shrugged, the gesture uncannily similar.

""I can't abandon them."" The decision crystallized. ""I need to go back.""

Tyler nodded. ""Then take this."" He removed the camera. ""It lets you see truth through the lens. What's real, what's mask."" His form flickered. ""You can't save everyone. Focus on the sensitives‚Äîthey're the only ones who can rebuild the boundaries.""

I accepted the camera. It felt warm. ""Will this protect me?""

""No. It makes you a target."" Tyler stepped back toward the altar. ""But it gives you power no human should have‚Äîto see beyond the veil, to record what exists between worlds."" He tapped his watch, which had begun ticking forward. ""You have until sunrise. After that, the old rules won't apply. August will write new ones.""

""August Beaumont? He's coming back?"" Dani asked.

""He never left."" Tyler pointed toward camp. ""He's been waiting in the lake. The boundaries held him, feeding him annual offerings."" A smile too wide split his features. ""Now he's hungry for more than just the sensitives.""

Another crash echoed, followed by sickly green light.

""Go,"" Tyler urged. ""I'll try to slow the swimmers. The camera will guide you.""

""Come with us,"" I pleaded.

He shook his head. ""I can't cross back completely. Not anymore."" He embraced me briefly, his body wrong‚Äîtoo angular, joints bending impossibly. ""Find me when it's over. I'll be watching.""

He melted into shadows, leaving only the impression of antlers against moonlight.

Dani and I raced back to our canoe, the camera bouncing against my chest. The lake had awakened‚Äîchurning with movement as things rose from the depths. Pale shapes broke the water, climbing onto shore with jerky motions.

""Don't look directly at them,"" Dani warned. ""Row, fast!""

I paddled furiously, fighting waves. Through breaks in the fog, I glimpsed camp in disarray‚Äîflashlights darting, figures running, boundary stones uprooted, markings dark.

Halfway across, our canoe jolted to a stop. Water bubbled. A hand‚Äîpale, webbed, too many joints‚Äîgripped the gunwale.

""Swimmer,"" Dani gasped, smacking it with her paddle.

The hand didn't release; more appeared, grabbing the sides. Faces broke the surface‚Äîhuman-like but wrong, features rearranged. I recognized the missing Pine Cabin girl, eyes empty sockets, mouth stretched to her ear.

Acting on instinct, I raised Tyler's camera and snapped a photo. A flash illuminated the night. The swimmers recoiled, releasing our boat with shrieks like metal scraping stone.

""It hurts them,"" I realized, taking another photo.

Each flash pushed them back, creating a momentary circle of safety. We reached camp shore. Chaos reigned. The boundary had collapsed‚Äîstones scattered, broken, symbols faded.

Staff had barricaded themselves and campers in the main lodge. Through windows, I saw salt lines, hastily drawn symbols. Other campers had fled to various buildings, creating pockets of resistance.

""Creek Cabin,"" I told Dani. ""I need to check on them.""

We ran across the sports field, dodging shadows. The camera grew warm whenever danger approached. I raised it several times; each flash dispelled darkness.

Creek Cabin's windows glowed dimly. Through the glass, my campers huddled, surrounded by a salt circle. Jesse stood at the perimeter, reading from the rule book.

I pounded on the door. ""Jesse! It's Nate!""

The reading paused. ""Prove it's you.""

""How?""

""Say the response to Rule 3.""

""I acknowledge but decline,"" I called back.

The door cracked open. Jesse peered out. ""Mr. Blackwood? You came back?""

""I couldn't leave you."" I slipped inside, Dani following. ""Is everyone okay?""

""We're maintaining the circle,"" Jesse explained. ""The sensitives figured out we could adapt the boundary rules for smaller spaces."" He nodded toward three campers holding white stones from boundary markers. ""But it's failing. Something big is coming.""

Outside, a deep horn blast sounded‚Äînot the camp signal, but something older, deeper.

""August,"" Dani whispered.

""Who?"" Mia asked.

""The original owner. The one who opened the door."" I surveyed the group‚Äînine campers from my original ten. ""Where's Ryan?""

Faces fell. Jesse spoke softly: ""Something came through the wall. Looked like his mother, but... wrong. He went with it.""

I gripped Tyler's camera. ""We need to get to the main lodge. Combine our groups.""

""It's too far,"" a camper protested. ""Those things are everywhere.""

I held up the camera. ""This will protect us. It repels them.""

""For how long?"" Jesse asked. ""Sun rises in three hours. We can hold this circle until then.""

""The boundaries won't reset at sunrise,"" Dani cut in. ""Not this time. We need to establish new rules, new boundaries, or everything within miles will be consumed.""

""How do we do that?"" Jesse asked.

""The original ritual,"" she replied. ""Beaumont's, but in reverse. Close the door he opened.""

A thunderous impact shook the cabin‚Äîsomething large striking the wall. Through the window, I glimpsed a massive shape moving past, taller than the building, crowned with branch-like protrusions.

I raised the camera, looking through the viewfinder. What appeared as a shadow resolved into a figure‚Äîa man in outdated clothing, body stretched impossibly tall, head crowned with antlers branching infinitely.

""August,"" I breathed.

I snapped a photo. The flash illuminated him fully. He turned toward our cabin‚Äîa face too smooth, too perfect, like wax. He raised a hand the size of a car door and pointed.

The walls creaked, wood splintering.

""The circle won't hold,"" Jesse warned. ""He's too strong.""

""We need to run,"" I decided. ""Now, while he's distracted.""

I distributed remaining boundary mixture, instructing campers to mark themselves. Dani helped.

""Stay together,"" I instructed. ""I'll lead with the camera. Dani guards the rear. Sensitives in the middle‚Äîthey want you most.""

The cabin groaned. We burst through the door into chaos‚Äîthe night alive with creatures crossing freely. Staff fought a retreating battle.

Through the camera viewfinder, I spotted a clear path to the main lodge‚Äîshadows ran thinner there. ""This way,"" I directed, leading our group.

We sprinted across open ground, the camera flashing. Halfway there, a wall of fog cut our path‚Äîthick mist coalescing into human-like figures.

""Swimmers,"" Dani warned. ""They've fully crossed over.""

Through the lens, I saw them clearly‚Äîformer campers and staff, bodies vessels for what lived in the lake. They encircled us.

""Give us the sensitives,"" they spoke in unison, voices bubbling. ""The rest may go.""

""I acknowledge but decline,"" I replied, raising the camera.

Before I could take a photo, a blur of motion struck from behind the swimmers‚Äîa figure moving with impossible speed, antlers silhouetted. It tore through them, creating an opening.

""Tyler,"" I whispered.

Through the gap, I glimpsed the main lodge. Eliza stood on the porch, drawing complex symbols. Behind her, Hank directed staff positioning stones in a new configuration.

""They're establishing a new perimeter,"" Dani realized. ""We need to get inside before they complete it, or we'll be locked out.""

We charged through the opening Tyler created, racing toward the lodge. Behind us, Beaumont's massive form pursued.

""Run!"" I shouted.

Eliza spotted us, hesitated, then stepped aside, letting us pass before resuming her drawing.

Inside, terrified campers huddled. Staff reinforced windows and doors. Hank directed stone placement around the foundation.

""You brought them right to us,"" Eliza hissed.

""I brought survivors,"" I countered. ""Including four sensitives who can help strengthen your new boundary.""

She studied our group, gaze lingering on the sensitives. ""Beaumont wants them. If we give him what he wants‚Äî""

""We'd just be continuing what you've done for decades,"" I interrupted. ""Feeding the monster. It never ends.""

Through the window, I watched Beaumont approach, fog swirling. Swimmers gathered behind him.

""He's here,"" Jesse whispered, hand pressed to the wall. ""He wants in.""

The building trembled as Beaumont reached toward it, fingers elongating. Through Tyler's camera, I saw the truth‚ÄîAugust Beaumont had become a puppet, animated by countless smaller entities nesting within him.

""The boundary's not holding,"" Hank shouted as symbols faded.

Outside, Tyler appeared on the lodge roof, still caught between forms. Through the attic window, I heard his voice: ""Let me in, brother. I can help.""

I looked at Dani. She nodded grimly. ""We need all the help we get.""

I raised the camera to the attic window and took a photo. The flash illuminated Tyler's true nature‚Äîbranch, shadow, lens, fragments of my brother.

""I invite you in,"" I called.

The window burst inward. Tyler's form flowed into the lodge like smoke, reforming beside me. ""You needed a watcher,"" he said, voice echoing strangely. ""Someone who stands between.""

Outside, Beaumont's massive fist struck the building. The remaining stones glowed, then faded.

""We can't hold him much longer,"" Eliza admitted, fear breaking through.

Tyler placed a hand on my shoulder, fingers too long. ""There's one way,"" he said. ""A final rule that binds all others."" He raised his gaze to the ceiling where pre-dawn light appeared.

""What rule?"" I asked.

His smile stretched too wide. ""The one written in the oldest language. Blood and light. Dawn comes.""

The sun breaks over Prospect Mountain as I finish writing. My hand cramps, but I must record everything. Some details blur‚Äîa side effect of what happened at dawn.

They call it a gas leak now. The official explanation for why thirty-seven people vanished. The foundation closed. Buildings stand empty behind fences marked ""Environmental Hazard."" Authorities advise avoiding the area.

I finger the scar from wrist to elbow‚Äîa perfect line where I split my skin that morning. My blood joined that of the other survivors, creating the final boundary. Not stones, but people carrying fragments within us.

""The old rules were written on stone,"" Tyler explained. ""The new ones must be written in living vessels.""

I see them differently now‚Äîswimmers, watchers, guardians. Through my viewfinder, the world reveals hidden layers. Sometimes I spot them in the city‚Äîhumans not quite human, edges blurring.

Jesse texts weekly from Cornell. His sensitivity has grown; he documents boundary fluctuations. Mia works with Hank‚Äîthe only original staff I trust‚Äîcataloging anchor objects from the old store, now in his cabin.

Eliza disappeared. Whether taken or fled is unknown. Dani visits monthly, comparing notes. The boundary held, but at a cost‚Äîwe're the living stones, human markers separating worlds.

Tyler remains somewhere in between. I glimpse him occasionally through the camera‚Äîantler shadows watching from forests or reflected in water. He left a note in the rule book:

The rules have changed, but the need for rules remains. What sleeps beyond still hungers. What watches still waits. Keep the boundaries, little brother. I guard one side. You guard the other.

August Beaumont never fully emerged. Our ritual pushed him back, but I feel him testing the new boundaries. In my dreams, I hear lake water, feel cold fingers reaching through fog.

The camera sits on my desk beside the notebook where I've written the new rules‚Äîseven statements maintaining the fragile separation. The first is simplest: Never stop believing what you've seen.

Last week, a letter arrived‚Äîa leadership retreat invitation from Syracuse University. Different name, same foundation. Starting again somewhere new.

I packed my bag that night‚Äîcamera, notebook, salt-iron mixture. The cycle continues, but this time, I know the rules that matter.

The coffee shop fills. A businessman's reflection shows antlers. A barista's hands bend impossibly. The woman at the corner table has eyes that never blink.

They're everywhere now. The boundaries grow thinner.

But we remember what happened at Camp Whispering Pines.

We carry the boundary within us.

We keep the rules.

And sometimes, when I photograph the Adirondack forests, I capture my brother in the background‚Äîa threshold guardian watching between worlds, keeping his side of the promise.

**Start with a Foundation** Use a tray to create structure. It pulls everything together and gives your tabletop a sense of order.

**Add Height & Layers** Stack coffee table books to add height and visual interest. Vary the size and orientation for a designer touch.

**Incorporate Candlelight** Whether it‚Äôs a sculptural candleholder or a pair of sleek pillars, candles add both ambiance and texture.

**Bring in Nature** Fresh florals or sculptural greenery bring life to your vignette. Bonus points for pairing a bold vase with your bouquet.

**Accent with Personality** Include one or two eye-catching objects‚Äîa decorative bowl, an art-inspired sculpture, or something with shine.

**Keep It Balanced** Mix materials (think marble, glass, metal) and make sure your layout has visual balance‚Äînothing too symmetrical, nothing too scattered.

We styled these two looks using some of our favorite pieces‚Äîfrom sculptural silver vases to shimmering glass bowls‚Äîfor a luxe look that‚Äôs polished, but never overdone.

As a person, I am someone who is confident around other people in general but when I fall in love with someone I become naturally submissive and strive to become the best version of myself that I possibly can be. 

Acts of service: my dream in life is to perform acts of service where I am solely responsible for all the house chores, cooking, laundry and even making sure that your shoes are clean. This will be in addition to working a full time job. 

Acts of kindness: I would love hold an umbrella over your head, carry your bag, serve you tea, juice coffee or anything you ask, run errands for you, driving you around to different places. 

Health and fitness: I watch my weight, exercise and eat healthy most of the time. Occasionally, I indulge myself with an ice cream, chocolate dessert or a pastry. 


WHAT DOES NOT MATTER TO ME IN A PARTNER

Religion (I will respect what you believe in) 

Anger issues: does not matter to me

Character and Personality: Since, I am a person who can adapt according to my future partners personality and character, this is not something that is important.

Level of Education: I got an executive level job without a Degree years ago (now I have one) due to my other strengths and capabilities. This is why, I feel that my future partners level of education is not important.

Hairstyle: hair colour and style don't matter to me. To be honest even if you were bold and wearing a wig it would never bother me.

Location: As long as I have someone I can love and care about, location does not matter as I have lived in different places in the world such as Jungles, Mountains, the coast where the beach was just 40 meters away and every day I would wake up to the view of sun rising over the Ocean. Even if we don't live in the same location at the moment we can be friends and keep in touch on Facebook or Instagram, althought it is on Facebook that I roll out updates that are happening both in my personal and professional life. This way we can figure out how we make this work and as soon as the opportunity presents itself, we can meet, get married, and where I will be yours forever. Many people think that distance is a problem, but in reality, it is not.

Your past: whatever you did in your past does not matter as I believe that everyone deserves a second chance in life. We all make mistakes, but learning from those mistakes and becoming a better person is what what matters. 

Send me a message if your interested and let's get to know each other better.

I suffer from (C)PTSD, ADHD and GAD, all of which are clinically diagnosed. ADHD and anxiety are an awful combo as i need to be stimulated (methylphenidate) which usually makes anxiety worse lol. 

My therapist/psychiatrist prescribed a type of sedative (medazepam) to me some two weeks ago now, on top of my other meds. It worked like a charm at first but these last three or so days it‚Äôs been going downhill.

I analyzed the possible causes of this and decided perhaps it‚Äôs because I hadn‚Äôt left home so I foolishly decided to go out to a busy area of town on a national holiday. It was an absolute fucking disaster:

I immediately got hit with an unusually strong anxiety attack while on public transport. It was so strong and I didn‚Äôt have any meds to get it under control so I decided to grab a beer since alcohol is a depressant (I know, it was a dumb decision as alcohol usually makes depression worse, plus I‚Äôm medicated but I couldn‚Äôt really think rationally.)

I‚Äôm very strict about my alcohol consumption and it was already a bummer that I resorted to it when I wasn‚Äôt planning to drink today. I only drank a single pint but it was enough to make me pretty dizzy, which I absolutely hate. I immediately grabbed some food afterwards and drank a ton of water.

Ironically though it did help with my anxiety. While now my anxiety levels dropped from, say, 8/10 to around 5/10, I‚Äôm extremely pissed at myself and in general.

Why the fuck did I think it would be a good idea to go out to a part of town filled with loud noises and annoying people? 

Now I‚Äôm sitting at an overpriced coffee shop and mostly in control of my senses. I absolutely fucking hate every part of this. In a minute I‚Äôll put my headphones on and go the fuck home. 

I will be consulting my psychiatrist as soon as possible of course and while I‚Äôm miserable, at least I‚Äôm functioning. Right now I just feel pretty bummed. Living with mental disorders is like a curse. When the fuck does it end? ( I know it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúend‚Äù but I‚Äôd like to be stable for a good while at least)

I will give you as much context as I can but being short.

My (29F) long distance boyfriend (32M) has been caught lying to me multiple times. Sometimes hiding stuff that he didnt need to hide. I recently found he had four secret instagram accounts and when I confronted him about it he said he was sorry that he forgot. That he has ADHD (i do as well) and that he forgets things. He said he never did anything bad with those accounts. Problem is thats not the first time he lied. First time he lied he lied about his coworker Kim,. He was only following her on instagram and when we first started dating he quickly followed his other coworker to cover up that they were friends. Even though I asked ""is she your close friend?"" then later hid about some messages he had with a teenager in church- I checked and there was nothing inappropriate. He was the youth leader at his church and became best friends with one of the teen girls and she considered him as family. Understandably I had issues with that because ever since I graduated college at 21 I didnt even feel like I had a lot of things in common with the teens at my church and even though I have been a camp leader I never even considered any of them close enough to do what he did- they followed each other on instagram and would joke with each other and go to coffee sometimes. Im Colombian in the US and I found several accounts of him following Colombian youth groups in Colombia and Colombian restaurants and waitresses. He did confess to me that on multiple occasions he in the past hit on the Colombian waitresses and specifically only followed Colombian accounts.

On top of those big ones there were other small little lies. Over and over I have started having panic attacks. To these he responds- remember to do your devotionals baby, and ""how can I pray for you and help you with your condition?"" he keeps promising to change but its been 9 months since he first lied- when we started dating- and he continues to lie. But now he just always claims he is ""sorry"" and he ""forgot about it"" I had a mental breakdown last week I was contemplating dying, I understand as a Christian is hard to comprehend but I was almost interned in the hospital. I cant sleep. I cant eat well. On top of everything he has been asking for advice to my family, his family, his friends and he basically just says ""I dont know what to do with her she is so jealous."" because ever since he started lying I get really anxious about other girls he works with or messages since I dont know what is the truth anymore. I have thought about breaking up but he says "" Don't do this to me."" and ""Sorry Im a failure."" appealing to my more empathetic side- or throwing the blame on me- or crying. His Mom told me ""He is a good Christian guy and he would never fail you- he deserves someone who is not anxious."" Instead of telling my family and friends I wanted to ask a bunch of strangers because I know you wouldnt be biased.

1kqe9w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1kqe9w3/fruit_slip_up_messed_me_up/,Fruit slip up messed me up,"I had been doing well on a Carnivore diet with dairy but hit a rough patch, and I need your advice. I live in a household where almost everyone eats a lot of processed food. The pantry is always stocked with tons of chips, sugary sweets, and more. 

Today, I gave into a sugar craving and ate a banana with whipped heavy cream, honey, and cinnamon. My thought process was ‚Äúthis will be way better than the processed food at least.‚Äù I was also curious to see how my stomach would react. In short, my stomach instantly felt irritated.

Within 5 minutes, my inner carb demons were awakened, and the cravings intensified. I proceeded to eat custard cakes, chocolate biscuits, flavored crackers, and other processed food uncontrollably. The distress in my stomach right now is something to behold, and I‚Äôm very disappointed in myself.

I‚Äôd like to get your thoughts on how to move forward. 

My questions are:

- How do I completely eliminate sugar cravings? Should I stop all dairy? (I‚Äôve been eating cheese, full-fat milk with coffee, and unsweetened probiotic yogurt fairly often, as they‚Äôre animal-based and helped me for a good amount of time to avoid cravings. I‚Äôm aware some of these products have carbs, like lactose in milk and yogurt, and I suspect dairy might be a trigger. If I stop and push through, will the cravings go away?)

- How do I reset my stomach and recover from this?

- Would it be best to fast for a few days?

- I also have Ulcerative Colitis. what‚Äôs the most effective version of the Carnivore diet for managing it? 

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: 

if you‚Äôre feeling good on Carnivore but struggling with sugar/carb cravings, absolutely do not give in. Fruit and honey set this off for me, so if you were previously a carb or processed food addicted person, don‚Äôt be fooled, as they may flip that switch.

TL;DR: Thriving on Carnivore despite UC, but a banana with honey triggered a processed food binge. My stomach‚Äôs a mess, and cravings are back. How do I kill sugar cravings, reset my gut, should I fast, and what‚Äôs the best Carnivore diet for UC?",1,1747667792.0,carnivorediet,3,1.0,False

I am very mad, but also really sad.","I lost my job recently because of the DOGE/new admin BS about ""saving money."" The treasury is actively withholding congressionally appropriated funds illegally. So my org laid off about half of the staff, myself included.

I am not going to lie, I thought I would be fine, I had been there for 7 years and considered myself ""well liked"" enough that I would survive the cuts. I was dead wrong. Other people who been there a long time were also cut, while people who had only just started a year or 2 ago were kept on. It was a punch to the gut. I understand that they had to make cuts, but it still sucks.

I also foolishly assumed that they would be honest with me as to why I was laid off. Nope, my manager told me that he did not make the decision, that the executives did, and that he only found out after the fact. That may be true, and I assumed I Deserved the dignity of knowing why (my performance evaluation was good, i did not have any active conflicts), but nope. Silence. I get why they didn't tell me, but again, it sucks hard.

And one of the worst parts was the callousness of it all. This org likes to pretend that it treats its employees differently compared to corporate America, that we are a ""family."" Well guess what 7 years of service gets you: A boiler plate scripted phone call from your manager without any personalized messaging. It felt like he was reading from a script. My supervisor also never bothered to reach out despite telling me multiple times that we ""are a team and look out for each other.""

The thing is that I don't think I am a special snowflake who deserves a parade or whatever, lots of other people also lost their jobs. But I don't think a phone call with some empathy is too much to ask? After working with me for several years, is that really a bridge too far? Talk about some of the good things I did?

So I am extremely upset and mad about the whole thing, fuming actually. But I am starting to realize that this anger is also a veil for some deep sadness that I am feeling. I am sad that I was deemed expendable and less worthy than some of my junior colleagues, I am sad that I was treated like a one time use coffee cup by people I worked with several years, and I am sad about the whole situation. I am applying to jobs but feel like I can't get past the AI filter. I feel worthless as a human being. 

At least some of my co workers reached out, so I am grateful for that. But at the end of the day I am just a cog in the machine, and I will be disposed of without remorse, no matter how many times they tell you otherwise.

She‚Äôd like my instagram posts at 12am when I was sleeping and kept sending gym selfies of herself. 

We went to meet on our 2nd date to get taco‚Äôs, she shared her location with me, but I didn‚Äôt accept it. I just said its not necessary and I don‚Äôt do that. She got there, we had a great dinner and after she got in my car and we kissed. Its like her personality shifted right after this. She said she doesn‚Äôt want me talking with other girls but only her and called me babe cuddling me. I told her I don‚Äôt want to rush things at all, and she seemed to be a little controlling wanting a relationship now. Hence, we barely know each other. 

After we left, she sent nude videos of herself on Snapchat to me and kept saying she loves me. Should I run like hell because I feel like this is love bombing. She seems to want to rush things, and its too much. Now she‚Äôs posting things about me about how im her man, and how she will love and respect me.

Basically I took a dozen titles (*Book Lovers, The Kiss Quotient, The Love Hypothesis, Yours Truly, Red, White & Royal Blue, Love and Other Words, One True Loves, It Ends with Us, Archer's Voice, Me Before You, The Simple Wild,* and *The Flatshare*), extracted ""top attributes"" from each one, then compiled them all into ""top of the top"" 

  
None of these are mind blowing secrets no one's ever thought of, but I think it's pretty cool to see the recurring patterns. Here's what I found, with a couple of excerpts:

  
**1. Crackling Banter**  
Rapid-fire wit/self-deprecating humor turns dialogue into a chemistry engine.

\- ""If there‚Äôs one thing that makes me horny,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs deforestation.‚Äù"" (*Book Lovers*)  
\- """"Can we call him Doctor D?"" ""No."" ""Why?"" ""Because Doctor D sounds like a penis thing."""" (*Yours Truly*)



**2.Sensory-Soaked Setting**  
Textures, smells, skylines; everything echoes emotion, making place a co-protagonist.

\- ""I pull in the scent of coffee and toast, the sound of music rumbling beneath the bustle of the customers."" (*Love and Other Words*)  
\- ""We went to three stores and I tried on twelve pairs of jeans. Some were too baggy, some too tight..."" (*One True Lovers*)

**3. Family/Friend Anchor**  
These circles ground the romance, adding warmth, stakes, comic shade.

\- ""But that evening was the exception in my relationship with my sister, a rare moment of kinship between two people who merely coexisted."" (*OTL*)  
\- ""Mum couldn‚Äôt work, as she had to look after Granddad, and Granddad‚Äôs pension amounted to almost nothing."" (*Me Before You*)

**4. Close-Up Voice**  
Intimate first-person lens pulls readers inside the heartbeat, thought-stream, secret longing.

\- ""You‚Äôve got to say this for desperation: it makes you much more open-minded."" (*The Flatshares*)  
\- ""As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, looking down from twelve stories above the streets of Boston..."" (*It Ends with Us*)

**5. Competent Wreck**  
Protagonist is polished on the outside, a mess on the inside. Fosters relatability and sets up a growth arc.

\- ""He‚Äôs not going to be the youngest elected congressman in modern history without earning it, but nobody needs to know how hard he‚Äôs kicking underwater."" (*RW&RB*)  
\- ""I just want to work on the data."" (*The Kiss Quotient*)

\--

And for fun I also went ahead and visualized the narrative modes for these books, and the genre as a whole. Can't share images on this sub, but you can see it [here](https://imgur.com/a/5nU7D9U) \- cool stuff if you're into data ;)

1kqe5h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kqe5h1/is_it_love_if_it_hurts/,Is it love if it hurts?,"Hello. So I‚Äôm going through a breakup right now. I‚Äôll tell my story, I‚Äôm just sharing this more for myself than truly seeking help and advices tbh. Well, I‚Äôm just here to vent. I will try to keep it short but I know I‚Äôll end up writing too much. I divide the story in six parts: (1) How we met and got together (2) After we became adults (3) How we got together again (4) During this second relationship (5) The second breakup (6) Now

I‚Äôm sorry if I write too much, it will be loooong but a lot is going on in my life and I am so tired of it. Also, sorry if my English is bad.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî (1) How we met and got together.

‚Äî First year in high school, I‚Äôm 14 then 15. Not paying attention to anyone, feeling alone in my mind. I had friends but I felt lonely. This girl from my class that I noticed a bit approaches me one day, straight up asking if she could be my friend (it may sound weird and yes, it was). I said no. After being asked the same question several times for a week, we inevitably ended up being friends because we would sometimes hang out with the same group of friends. We became really close friends quickly. We were so different, but I never knew you could be both so different yet so similar to a person.

I realized my obsession for her before I could tell myself that I even liked her. I always had attachment issues and fear of abandonment, but with her, it felt like I only thought about her, and the more we spent time together, the more I couldn‚Äôt see a future without her in my life in a way or another. Then I realized it could be love, although I was still confused if it was some sick obsession or just‚Ä¶ simply love.

Time pass, I‚Äôm in second year of high school, Covid is here, and so are quarantine and social distancing at school.

She had to live somewhere else after our first year of high school, really far away, but we were still talking regularly by messages, and calls in games and all. We had a discussion one day and that‚Äôs when I thought that my feelings may be reciprocated. We confessed when we saw each other IRL. So we started a long distance relationship, only seeing each other a few times a year. I honestly don‚Äôt remember how long we stayed together. But it was several months.

Covid was giving everyone a hard time, including mine. Everything was so stressful: my parents, school and my future, my own pessimistic and very depressing thoughts. I even regularly self-harmed. Feeling loneliness because I had no friends anymore (like I said I never managed to keep friends, I always end up isolating myself from everyone at some point)‚Ä¶. Etc. So many factors. So when for a week she seemed a bit more distant, just a little bit, I felt unloved and after I had another countless argument with my parents yelling at me, I had enough of everything and broke up with her just like that by messages, saying really, really mean things in the process. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what was being said and I don‚Äôt want to look for screenshots of that moment. Only a few things (and some horrible shits I said), but I think she said that she never really loved me, it was just curiosity. Needless to say I regretted it afterwards and cried for days. To the point that my heart ached so much I ended up passing out or at least I had some sort of black out for a little moment. It freaked me out and I thought I had a heart attack or something so I promised myself to never feel this much emotions for someone (yet it still happened another time months later).

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî (2) We became adults

‚Äî We kept in touch a bit. When I was in college we eventually interacted one way or another a little bit. Because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. She was my first real relationship and at that point in life, I never unloved her. However my mind did almost give up on the hope to be reunited with her in the long term, just as friend or not. It was not the chaos anymore in my mind, just emptiness and I felt numb and dumb, living life without really living it, skipping class and spending all my money on food and coffees. I went to my first bar, drank my first real alcohol, went to my first night club, kissed strangers and letting girls leave marks on my neck. Always ended regretting though. I was always thinking about her and I felt so disgusted at myself to even let others grabbing me and kissing me so easily when I was drunk. No matter how much people praised my looks, I always saw myself as ugly and unattractive. I never had sex, never had another partner even for ""fun"". I don‚Äôt know why it felt like cheating, when it wasn‚Äôt, because I wasn‚Äôt with her anymore. It just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel right. At all. So I just hated sex in real life without even truly experiencing it.

I learned that she was in a relationship with a guy. We saw each other IRL only once or twice a year, every time because I asked for it. A certain year, in December, she said she may not be able to see me after all this time. I didn‚Äôt force it and felt disappointed, but accepted it. Who was I to start arguing like a pre teen about it? We were barely close now, we barely chatted. I had no rights. I was almost a stranger to this girl who I was the closest with once. So one day I went out to town, trying to get her out of my mind for once, by piercing my right lobe and feeling something new. Wore something original and pretty classy, I made the effort to try to look good even though I was just going out at the tattoo salon to get that piercing. When it‚Äôs done, I go home.

Who do I see on the almost empty bus, sitting two meters away from me? Yes. And she was with her man. I didn‚Äôt know if my eyes were working correctly, if my glasses were giving me hallucinations. I mean there were so many times I‚Äôd see girls who look like her but were not her. But this one felt so familiar, and so was the guy next to her. Her hands, her clothing style, her glasses, the style of her backpack‚Ä¶. Everything was so familiar that my heart skipped a bit. But I froze when I heard her sniffing a bit. Just one little, soft sniffing, because of the cold or whatever. How can I see the one I call the love of my life and convince myself it‚Äôs not her, but then hear her sniffing once and I recognize her by that familiar sound? It‚Äôs ridiculous. Anyways, I literally ran away from that damn bus and almost slipped and fell, then cried for days again. I texted her if it was her that I saw, and we talked about that a lot afterwards, and I ended up saying how much I still loved her. I even told her I wanted to be with her again, but of course I was rejected. I didn‚Äôt even realize my feelings were so strong, I thought I still loved her but I could never feel strong emotions because of her. I was wrong, very wrong.

We met again months later. I gave her earrings I wanted to gift her quite some time ago. I asked her if she loved him so much, if she could imagine being with him for the rest of her life, she said maybe. I asked her if one day, in our life, I will have a small chance. She said 0%. Well at least she was loyal. Anyways we parted ways and I thought it was over and my life was over. Months later she contacts me in a weird way, but long story short that‚Äôs when we started contacting each other again. We secretly communicated like that for more than a year, I think. Time passes slowly. I meet new people that I am still friend with to this day. They are truly amazing people and really good friends.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî (3) How we got together again

‚Äî A lot happened. And we end up talking for real again. She sent an emote in a game I was about to drop for good. I saw it quite some time later and responded with another emote, didn‚Äôt expect an answer. But that‚Äôs how we gradually started talking in-game again. Slowly, but surely. Then we would talk by messages a lot. I would know what happens in her life, and I would also talk about mine. I then learn that her man, who she was with for three years, is an absolute jerk and bastard. At least, that‚Äôs what I call him. I already hated him for no reason (I mean I didn‚Äôt have any hatred towards her other exs, but this one I just did). I was drunk when I learned about how he treated her, so I left the club, leaving my angry friends alone, called her, got so emotional and said what I had to say.

I also need to say a big thank you this Uber driver who prolonged the whole ride by kilometers, taking a uselessly longer path just so I can stay a bit more in the car and talk to him about it. We had a nice chat and he actually gave me advices and his thoughts about it. I felt better and it helped me clear my mind. So thank you, Uber driver, you deserved that tip. The day after, she broke up with him and thanked me. She was too attached to him and didn‚Äôt have the heart to leave him even if her friends told her to, but she opened her eyes for good and got rid of him and thanked me.

I was glad and relieved for her. It‚Äôs funny because a year ago, I didn‚Äôt wish for her to be happy with the one she loved. Quite the opposite actually. I didn‚Äôt wish her the best like many wishes their loved one to be genuinely happy with someone else. I guess I had enough resentment in my heart to think that. I know it‚Äôs bad to not wish the best for the one you say you love the most. But when she‚Äôs now single and close to me? I am not that much of a bastard and I was already broken anyway. The thought of trying to get back to her? An opportunity? It didn‚Äôt even cross my mind. I was just happy to be close to her again, that we would talk like we used to when we were younger, my love for her still so strong but sleeping deep inside my heart.

She asked me out a few months later. I was taken off guard I must admit. We were seeing each other IRL and I was already reluctant. No reason in particular. It‚Äôs like I was afraid of seeing her in real life instead of through a screen. Scared of what? I don‚Äôt know. But I managed to keep my composure I think. I didn‚Äôt give her an immediate answer. It was not the place, nor the time for me.

So many questions in my head. Why me? Why now? She didn‚Äôt say she liked me, only asked me if I wanted to be together with her again, what does that mean? Does she really love me? What if she still hasn‚Äôt healed from her previous relationship? What if it‚Äôs a mistake? Will she leave me one day? If I say no, will she insist and try to get me back, or will she just accept it and leave me alone for the rest of my life and forget about me for good? Etc‚Ä¶. I kept thinking about it and gave her my answer the next day.

So I said yes. Kind of obvious but yeah.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî (4) It lasted approximately five months.

It was nice to begin with. I finally felt alive even though I was still insecure. She went back to where she lives and we were in a long distance relationship again. I was not the type to say things like ¬´¬†Good morning love, good night love, how was your day? What did you eat? How are you?¬†¬ª. I wanted to, but she often responded so late, I would feel so sad and ridiculous to send a ""Good night"" at 11pm only for the message to be seen and answered the next day at 11am or in the afternoon. If we did talk like that, it was occasional, pretty rare. But it didn‚Äôt seem to bother her, nor me. I would sometimes love bombing her with words of affection. I wasn‚Äôt confident enough to do that the first months but gradually I opened up more and wasn‚Äôt that afraid to flirt a bit, like saying how good she looked in an outfit, how beautiful she is, how much I love her, things like that.

It was very shortly after we got together, she became a bit more distant, took her time to answer texts. I felt a bit left out but I tried to convince myself that it was okay and she had friends who she always hangs out with, school and a job too. She was more busy than me. Sometimes I answered a text a few seconds after receiving it, and she would see it hours later and she wouldn‚Äôt even be busy with anything at all. But I was used to it now. The worst that happened was three days without any news. I was so anxious that something might have happen and I even check the news of her town. I don‚Äôt really remember the exact explanation she gave me. Saying things like she was busy, and all. One day she told me that she sees the notification of my vocals on Instagram or my messages, and she‚Äôs either too busy at the moment, or doesn‚Äôt want to answer me just because, or because she doesn‚Äôt have any ""social battery left"" (funny how we‚Äôre different about this because after a long and tiring day, the first thing I want is to talk to her and not the annoying clients that come and go), and then she would forget about my messages and remember it hours, or even days later.

I didn‚Äôt like to complain every time something was bothering me. But if it became too much for me, I texted her a very long paragraph or two or three explaining why it does bother me. For example when she told me she was going to have a walk at the beach. I later found that she was actually with her ex (the jerk). I knew they were still in ""good terms"" and were just friends, but it just hurt, you know. She didn‚Äôt tell me to not make me jealous, but isn‚Äôt it worse to discover it myself? She didn‚Äôt lie, she just didn‚Äôt tell the truth. But it still hurt more. I sort of tried to ghost her for three days because it felt like my whole world was like a whale crushing me. At the end I just sent her a big paragraph explaining how uncomfortable I was regarding this matter.

She was drunk that night, and she answered before reading it all and thinking a lot about it. She said things like ""I hear you and understand it might be uncomfortable to you, but I told you I wanted to keep things polite and respectful between him and me. We didn‚Äôt leave in bad terms and I wanted to keep being friends with him, I don‚Äôt even see him as a man anymore, just as someone who got lost and made mistakes. I know it might be annoying for you. I‚Äôll try to distance myself from him. I can‚Äôt promise you anything, but I‚Äôll do what I can."" I was so mad and sad by that answer because she answered exactly how I expected her to respond. I knew she‚Äôd say things like ""I hear you and understand, I can‚Äôt promise you anything, bla-bla-bla‚Ä¶"" I just know her too well. I just knew. Anyway the next day when she was sober she must have thought about it a lot and, after I sent her another big paragraph saying I was sorry and that I don‚Äôt want her to be sad if she‚Äôs not hanging out with him so she can keep seeing him at the condition she‚Äôs telling me every time and that I do not wish to keep her away from her friends, she told me she cut all ties with him. I believed her.

Months pass, she still takes forever to answer my texts but she doesn‚Äôt act out of character and I am convinced that she loves me, even if it‚Äôs a bit. She tells me how things aren‚Äôt going well in her life regarding her social life (she never told me those things happened when it actually happened. I wonder how our relationship ended up with her keeping those things from me. I care about her, I would have help or support her). I love her more and more by the days, but also, I learned how to love myself again. I start to feel very positive, seeing myself in the future I never thought I‚Äôd imagine again. I see myself living with her, coming home in the evening after a long day at work and chilling on the couch with her, with pets why not, I even thought about children even if it‚Äôs something more complicated. I thought about marriage, growing old, retirement, travels, arguments, getting her flowers on a random Thursday, cooking for her, cleaning for her, helping her with everything, things like that. A normal life. I dreamt of a normal and peaceful life for once. We don‚Äôt make promises and don‚Äôt often talk about our dreams of the future, but she did talk about thinking of going back to our hometown for her studies, living together in an apartment so I can leave my parent‚Äôs house and she can leave the place she actually lives at, that she said ""have given her so much trauma"".

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî (5) She broke up with me

On a random Wednesday morning she broke up with me. She was almost ghosting me since Sunday before. My texts were left on read, then delivered even to this day. At some point, I called her. I knew she didn‚Äôt like calls, and I always respected that and only called her once or twice when I was drunk, but I needed to know what going on. She didn‚Äôt completely ignore me, she sent me two random pictures of cans on Monday. But that‚Äôs all. Needless to say my calls weren‚Äôt picked up. Instantly to voicemail. And I called countless times. I am pretty sure she blocked me, just like that, without any warning. She didn‚Äôt block me on Instagram though. But she might have hide my notifications. When she saw I called her on Instagram she asked what was going on. I asked if her SIM card had some issues and she said it still bugs sometimes. So I felt relief‚Ä¶ but a few minutes later, three big paragraphs saying she breaks up with me.

Basically she apologized because she said she won‚Äôt be able to come back for a few months due to financial issues. But also that she thinks she mistook friendship and love. That I love her too much, and she feels guilty of not feeling the things as strong as I do. That she even thought of meeting new people (which she says she didn‚Äôt do). Also that she never really felt attracted to me, which made me think I was so ugly again and I can‚Äôt look at myself in a mirror anymore.

I was so desperate and didn‚Äôt just accept it. I tried to convince her, saying how we can work on that, that it‚Äôs the distance that ruins everything, that because of the distance it‚Äôs normal to feel some sort of loss or doubting our love or craving for a human touch and direct affection. After all, since the time we were back together in later December, we didn‚Äôt see each other IRL. I told her I could buy a plane ticket and come see her tomorrow, that I could even move out to be closer to her home and I‚Äôll find another job there. She refused because she had exams. I must have sound so pathetic but hey, I was losing my love again. She thinks my whole life depends on her. It might have been true for a period of time. It might have been true at the beginning of our new start. But like I said I learned how to appreciate myself and do a job I really knew I would like, it wasn‚Äôt just about her anymore, even if she was still my top priority (and still is). I was thinking about myself and my well-being for once.

The worst thing is the use of hesitation in her texts. Words like ""I don‚Äôt think, I think, maybe, I probably‚Ä¶"" etc. It was giving me false hope. I told myself that if something was wrong, if she went through something stressful (exams, driving test, social life‚Ä¶), I could help her. She said that she felt bad for using me, that she talks to me because she likes talking to me, and also because she would feel less lonely when talking to me. After, she says that she was very lonely and learned to appreciate loneliness for the past few months, and with that peace of mind she lets me go and is being honest with me for once instead of lying about her love for me. It just didn‚Äôt sound right to me. And I also saw myself, years ago, thinking that loneliness was so good and made for me, only to be even more depressed as the days went by without realizing.

I tried to give so many arguments, I tried to convince her. She ended up promising me that she‚Äôll think about it, but she thinks she already made up her mind. She said we‚Äôll talk about it a week later, after her exams are over next Friday. When I insisted to come see her, she said she‚Äôll come back to talk to me IRL about it, that she has to see her father anyway. I‚Äôm so scared of when that day will come. It will come soon. I don‚Äôt want to hear out loud the words that I hate to hear. I already know what her answer will be. I think I know.

I thought she wouldn‚Äôt be thinking about contacting me at all until we meet again. She did say she was thinking of deleting me from Instagram so we can‚Äôt accidentally see each other‚Äôs stories and run in each other online, but if needed I could contact her on WhatsApp (she once told me she hated this app). I thought I‚Äôd be ghosted, no-contact‚Ä¶ but she still asked me how my driving test went Friday. She asked about me. I asked about her. I said good job before she went to work. I was planning on asking about her driving test this evening, but she told be about it this morning without me reaching out first.

It‚Äôs a pure bliss. But also a pure torture. It still gives me hope. I told myself I should not text first and only text if she answered me, to let her the space she probably needed and give her the loneliness she wants by breaking up. I am afraid of talking as often as I did, but risking of scaring her away. And I am also afraid of not talking to her, and risking that she loses interest in me quickly and find someone else or realize that she doesn‚Äôt miss me when we‚Äôre not talking. I am lost. I think she‚Äôs lost a bit too. Not the same lost as me though.

I‚Äôve lost all the confidence I did build these last months. Everything. Back to square one‚Ä¶ maybe lower. We reach out our hand to each other when we needed it the most, and I got karma for the pain I gave her after I broke up the first time, I guess.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî (6) Life is shit

Wednesday: she broke up with me.

Thursday: I receive a call from the doctors. I donated my blood a few weeks ago and apparently they found some issue in my blood. I asked the lady: ""Is it something that can threaten my life?"". Guess what she said? ""Well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ yes. If you don‚Äôt take any treatment and receive medical care soon, then yes."" Super nice. I honestly didn‚Äôt feel anything when I got these news. No anger, no sadness, no disbelief. Nothing. Just got a call, listened and accepted it. I have no idea what illness or infection it is. They can‚Äôt tell me on the phone and I have to wait Wednesday (in two days from the moment I write those lines). I know there is a higher chance of me becoming bald because of stress than me dying very soon. Maybe it‚Äôs nothing. Maybe it‚Äôs not that bad, just a bit of medication for a lifetime and I can live long. But still.

Friday: I fail my driving test.

Saturday: Started at 10am. I am so bad at work that I got reprimanded real bad for the first time, both by colleagues and clients. I didn‚Äôt realize I was being rude or unfocused, I tried to not let my mood get in the way but it was so hard. I threw up in the toilets at work and felt sick on my stomach and my whole body felt like burning because of stress (it happens every day since the breakup). I wanted to take a day off but they refused with a big smile, saying that if I handled it for four hours, I can handle four more. Two hours of break time, I finished work at 9pm like usual, completely exhausted and irritable.

Today is Monday, and it felt like the universe is playing a game and toying with me. How can things go so wrong in such short amount of time? Friends tried to distract me by hanging out, but it‚Äôs just not enough you know. I am probably disrespectful and not thankful enough with them. They really listened to my yapping and brought me to eat and drink and I could only repay them with a smile and my presence. But it just doesn‚Äôt make me happy. I keep thinking about her, my mysterious illness, my mistakes, my life so far.

And to be honest I even thought: ""If my love breaks up for good and wants to erase me from her life, then I‚Äôll just refuse medical help and let whatever illness I have take my life sooner. I am 21, very young, maybe too young to over react because of a simple breakup. But it‚Äôs just too much, you know. Family, love, money, health‚Ä¶. For the moment I won‚Äôt tell her about what the doctors said. I don‚Äôt want her to stress about something like that, if she would even stress about that in the first place. I don‚Äôt want her to feel forced to stay with me because omg I‚Äôm probably dying. And I certainly don‚Äôt want to hear her saying something like: ""It‚Äôs another reason for you to enjoy youth and life! Meet other people and move on without me!"". I hate hearing those words. Because I only love her. I always will. As pitiful as a swan.

I don‚Äôt even live in a country where I have to worry about health and money that much. I don‚Äôt even live in a house that will throw me out for no reason, no matter how tense the atmosphere is everyday because of my parents. I still have friends. I don‚Äôt have anything I can complain about. But I still do complain. And I feel so ungrateful and I feel like a bastard and a coward for that. So many bad things happen in the world. Wars, murders, bad politicians making bad decisions, bad news everywhere, every day, every time. And here I am, a 21 years old cashier still living in my parent‚Äôs house, saying how life‚Äôs too hard.

I just wanted to be loved by her. Maybe I love too much. I know it‚Äôs not true, but my mind is still screaming at me: ""Love‚Äôs not real, and if it is, it‚Äôs not for you. Not ever.""

Maybe I‚Äôll write an update Wednesday or in a week, after my world will definitely be in ruins. I don‚Äôt use Reddit that much but it‚Äôs nice coming back to this app once in a while.",1,1747667491.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1kqe3sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1kqe3sr/top_5_strategies_from_the_viral_blueprint_vault/,Top 5 Strategies from the Viral Blueprint Vault,"**Hey, fellow content creators!** üåü 

Ever feel like you‚Äôre spinning your wheels trying to go viral? Trust me, we‚Äôve all been there. You put in hours crafting that perfect post, tweet, or video ‚Äì and then crickets. It‚Äôs enough to make you want to throw your keyboard out the window. üò© But what if I told you that there are tricks out there in the *Viral Blueprint Vault* that can help you work smarter, not harder?

Here are my **Top 5 Strategies** that from the Vault that can turn your content from ‚Äúmeh‚Äù to ‚ÄúOMG, I need to share this!‚Äù 

**1. Know Your Audience**  
This might sound like a no-brainer, but hear me out. You‚Äôve got to get in their heads. Think about:
- What problems do they need solving?
- What makes them laugh, cry, or shout, ‚ÄúOMG, same!‚Äù?  
Try creating a profile for your ideal follower. It‚Äôll help you craft content that resonates on a deeper level.

**2. Trend-spotting Like a Pro**  
Ever scrolled through TikTok or Twitter and thought, ‚ÄúHow did this become a trend?‚Äù Get in before something blows up!  
- Set up Google Alerts for keywords in your niche.  
- Follow industry influencers.  
- Use trending hashtags, but add your unique twist.  
It‚Äôs like riding a wave before it crashes, and you want to be out there surfing, not drowning.

**3. Storytelling is Your Secret Weapon**  
Why do you think we‚Äôre addicted to Netflix shows? Because they pull us in with stories! So, make your content sing with a narrative:
- Share personal anecdotes. Did you have a cringe-worthy moment you can laugh about now?
- Create relatable scenarios that your audience can see themselves in.  
We‚Äôre all just living out our own stories, so let‚Äôs make those connections!

**4. Engage, Engage, Engage!**  
Ever been in a conversation where someone just talks AT you? Annoying, right? Don‚Äôt let your audience feel that way. Instead:  
- Ask questions in your captions.  
- Respond to comments like you‚Äôre chatting with a friend over coffee.  
Community isn‚Äôt just a buzzword; it‚Äôs where the magic happens!

**5. Experiment Like You‚Äôre in a Science Lab** ‚öóÔ∏è  
Don‚Äôt be scared to try new formats or styles. One day you might write a heartfelt post, and the next, create a meme. It‚Äôs about finding what makes your audience tick. Maybe:
- Focus on short, punchy content one week, then dive into deep-dive articles the next.  
- Use polls or feedback to see what they want more of!  
Learn what works for you through trial and error. If it flops, just laugh it off and move on! 

So, what do you think? Got any strategies you‚Äôve tried that paid off? Or maybe a story of your content going way better than you expected? Let‚Äôs hear about it! Sharing is caring, and who knows? Your experience might just help someone else break through the noise. üöÄ",1,1747667378.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1kqe3na,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareAndDispair/comments/1kqe3na/toilet_bound_soul/,Toilet bound soul,"hello everyone, I am 32 years old. Ive had crohns for a few years, it's been such a horrible life and experience due to this illness. I wanna reach out and see what others have done or been doing to fix themselves instead of taking humera, prednisone and mesalamine 

initially I had a flare when I was younger around 25, gave me and endless supply of mesalamine and doctor through me out the door and off I went. it was painful, the doctor told me to eat whatever I wanted and I did and found out fried foods did not help the bloody stools 

My mom had noticed I was giving up, at 25 it was hard my life was starting as an adult and had many plans and I had given up. A man that could do anything but was bounded by pills for the rest of my life. I took the medication for awhile but I had given up, I was okay will letting it gets worse and me passing away. But mothers being mothers gave me the push I needed. Feeding me alfalfa pills and potato starch in water and eating vegetables. I got better in time riding my bike here and there and lifting weights I was back I was my  old self.........

  
forward a few years I am 29 now my life had its up and downs but that's life nothing I could handle. drinking on holidays never blacking out or excessive drug abuse at all either until sept 22,2022 

I spent the weekend in Vegas on a vacation ended up dehydrating myself and drinking a bit here in their maybe a total of 3 beers right and some snow too top it off. I never really recovered myself from being dehydrated so when I was back from vacation, I get a canes asada burrito and a Starbucks coffee and a breakfast sandwich and hot Cheetos not to forget. the next day bloody stool it came back. I blamed the food it was something I never regularly eat but I wanted to spoil myself.

got put on humera started treatment and it worked but unfortunaly due to the AZ heat once that started my stress on the body increased its been a total of maybe a month since Ive been flared up 

  
occasionally I will spice my water with mineral drops or turmeric and eat yogurts and nothing but the most simple made foods, sourdough with live culture, siggis yogurt, lean meats, liver, bone marrow, organic chicken, salmon, vegetables, and goats milk, just peanut butter crushed not processed, bananas, and I started juicing my own juice, carrots with orange, pineapple with cucumbers with kale and celery.

  
I even started this metal detox that ive start in hopes to clean my body to the max 

  
last night I did a detox bath (epson salt 1cup, bicarbonate 1cup, Indian healing clay 2tbsp. hot water and soak for 20mins. during my bath I was dying if you have crohns you understand that head fucks us up bad. I fought through it, once I was out the bottom of my feet had clay stuck to it I wasn't able to wash it off it was weird like magnetic pulling impurities. I was sweating from my pits and forehead, so I grabbed some yogurt with bananas and went out side for some reason. after I was finished eating I went inside and I felt static all over my body my arm hairs were straight up so I start touching the items that would shock me from walking on the carpet or sliding off the couch and nothing, in a sense I felt recharged 

  
this morning my usual bathroom routine was different it was not blood it was a puddle of brown stuff it was weird not sure if its the Impurities leaving my body but I am definatly  doing it again 2-3 times a week as well as the metal detox 

  
new added supplements I will try is acemannan aleo vera leaf extract and will relay results 

along with drinking bicarbonate 1/4 tsp with 20oz water for inflammation 

  
ive heard many things on what to take this that yada yada but never really seen any science to back it up 

so if anyone out there has taken or tried these things please share it, our bodys and DNA is different so some items will not work but I am willing to try and be a lab rat to help others get better 

  
I weigh 180 not from the medication making me bloated I am very fit and active 

  
so new things to add to the list later will be suramin a parasite killer 

parasite detox 

going to Mexico to get dialysis done to filter my blood from plastics and heavy metals 

fasting for 7 days 

I am trying to get rid of the prednisone since its so harmful and affecting my vision so any help helps

1kqe12u,https://i.redd.it/85rr24457r1f1.jpeg,A Walk-Away Emergency Landing In Grand Canyon,"**A 1967 Walk-away Emergency Landing in the Bottom of the Grand Canyon**

I do oral histories with people who worked or hiked or boated or flew in the Grand Canyon. This is an interesting story so go get some coffee and settle in...

Fifteen years ago, the Grand Canyon High School Coach Dan Lopez had told me that one of the Hudgin Air Service/Grand Canyon Airlines sightseeing planes had made a dead-stick landing on a large sandbar in Grand Canyon. Dan said he helped a pilot named Wayne Learn take that plane apart and Wayne flew the pieces out by helicopter.

During an interview last year with retired Park Engineer Dan Cockrum, he recounted the 1966 construction of the Silver Bridge near Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Dan mentioned taking many flights in and out of the Canyon by helicopter. The pilot was Wayne Learn. Learn and Bob Thurston started helicopter tours at Tusayan, Arizona, in April of 1966, forming Tusayan Helicopter Service, INC. Wayne used a Hiller OH-5A for this operation.

After interviewing Cockrum, I interviewed Ellen Hudgin and her sons Doug and Louis. This story tumbled out and it all came together.

Ellen‚Äôs husband Henry flew several thousand tours in the Grand Canyon with his older brothers Al and Palen. In 1950 they started flying early high wing PIPERs over the canyon from the Red Butte Grand Canyon Airport. When PIPER introduced the low wing Apache and Commanche in the mid 1950's they discovered that the view was much better when flown below the rim and looking up. Another benefit with the low wing was in a turn the wing moved out of sight whereas in a high wing your view was blocked in a turn. They continued to fly low wing tours after moving their operation to the present day Grand Canyon Airport when it opened in the mid-1960s. Two decades later after a midair collision in the Canyon, the FAA required all tours be flown above the canyon rim.

In the late 1950‚Äôs, Al introduced a Turbo Charged Bell 47 Helicopter to the flightline and did tours with the helicopter while Henry, Palen and other pilots flew Pipers and a De Havilland Dove during the busy summer season. Tragically, Al died in that helicopter on the San Francisco Peaks on July 11, 1961, but that‚Äôs another story.On July 11, 1967, Henry‚Äôs flying day started in Nogales, AZ, after the funeral for his mother. He‚Äôd loaded his wife Ellen and their children into a Piper PA-32-300 Cherokee 6 and flew north across the state of Arizona to the new Grand Canyon Airport at Tusayan. On arriving back at the Canyon, Henry got right to work flying that afternoon‚Äôs tours in the same Cherokee 6.

Later in the afternoon he flew a sightseeing tour over the east end of the Park. The tour proceeded as normal up to about Hance Rapids when the diaphragm that controls the fuel/air mixture in the fuel injection failed. At that point the engine was still running but had lost most of its power and was surging badly out of control. With the loss of power, the airplane began to lose altitude with no hope of regaining it back. Running out of altitude and options, Henry knew of a sand bar past the confluence of the Big and Little Colorado Rivers by Kwagunt Rapids. It was perfect for an emergency landing and Henry nursed the airplane there. He arrived with little altitude to spare. Without missing a beat, as he continued to lose altitude, he calmly told his passengers to make sure their seat belts were securely fastened. His passengers thought nothing of it. This was, after all, a tour flight and they assumed they were landing along the river as part of the tour.

When Henry touched down on the soft sand and gravel bar, the main landing gear collapsed, quickly followed by the nose gear. He slid the plane to a stop and asked everyone to get out of the plane. It was baking hot in the bottom of the Canyon but at least the plane was not on fire. The plane‚Äôs radio worked, and Henry started making a mayday call. Another Hudgin tour plane heard the call, and on returning to the Airport, got word to Wayne Learn that a helicopter rescue was needed. Wayne flew his Hiller into the Canyon, landed nearby, loaded everyone up and flew them out of the Canyon. With approval from the National Park Service, Wayne flew back a few weeks later, took the plane apart with Dan Lopez, and flew the pieces out.

Flash forward to January 2025. I‚Äôm on a 30-day river trip in the Grand Canyon. I have a few pictures Louis Hudgin let me copy. Those pictures were taken that afternoon in 1967. And I‚Äôm at Kwagunt! The rematch was a lot of fun. The area where the plane landed was scoured by the Colorado River during the highwater of 1983. That may be why I found nothing of the damaged airplane and disassembly. Still, everything lined up and we were at the location where Henry and his passengers walked away from an emergency landing in the bottom of the Grand Canyon.Thanks to technical advisor Louis Hudgin, his brother Doug, their mother Ellen, NPS Park Engineer Dan Cockrum, and Coach Dan Lopez.

Yesterday, as I braked I had a coffee in the REAR cupholder, this leaned forward and spilled directly into the REAR USB port. After a while of driving, my iPhone Connected into the FRONT USB port disconnected from CarPlay, even though the Cable still had power (cable lights up green to show power). I turned the car off, used a pin and tissue to stick into the rear USB to soak up as much coffee as possible. I turned the car back on and no BOTH FRONT AND REAR USB ports do not work / have no power.

I've tried cleaning inside the USB port with alcohol 99%, but has not worked. I checked Fuse 17 in passenger side (Infortainment system) and it's fine. The cigar lighter has power, and the rear USB BLUE LED Ring still lights up - but Both front and rear USB ports are not working EVEN THOUGH leak was ONLY IN THE REAR.

  
I don't know what else to do and would really appreciate some help guys. Thank you so much.

P.s. I had pulled the Rear module USB Out as in the image, but it's stuck like this, I can't pull it out any further. It feels like there is cable tension and if I pull more I will snap cables. ",0,1747667159.0,Ford,3,0.5,False

I have noticed that the past few years, any time I start doing regular cardio (running or cycling mostly) my resting hear rate plummets within the first week or so. 

I would say I am average in fitness and while I do walk 3-5 miles a day at a 20 minute pace, and can run a 5k no problem, from everything I have seen the heart rates I am averaging are more normal for an elite athlete, not a normal guy.

 I have been getting low heart rate notifications (39-40bpm)  on my Apple Watch overnight several time over the past couple of weeks and my average resting while awake has been sub-50 as well.

  
For the most part these things don't bother me as when I do walk or run, my heart gets to what I would consider a normal exercise rate, however I have been having some weird heart palpitations as well that are freaking me out.

 Last year I noticed my heart doing this and I tracked it down to too much caffeine (1 cup coffee and two cups of tea immediately afterward) I cut out the tea and it went away. When I went for a life insurance exam, I mentioned to the nurse practitioner what I was experiencing and she suggested it was PVC's and to speak to a cardiologist if cutting caffeine didn't work. It did so I didn't think too much of it until it started again after I started running again to hopefully do a marathon later this year. I have no dizziness, pain or any abnormal tiredness apart from what I would expect trying to get back to running regularly again. But it feels super weird when my heart does an extra beat. I know it's not 100% reliable but I will try to attach a couple of photos from my Apple Watch that will hopefully demonstrate what I am talking about.

I am hoping to either hear that this is totally normal, or if not where I need to go from here. I appreciate any help you all can provide.",1,1747667021.0,askCardiology,1,1.0,False
1kqdy2x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kqdy2x,[Rum Review #145] Car√∫pano XO,"To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Hacienda Altamira, where the Car√∫pano rum company is located, the brand launched this product simply called XO in 2012. It is worth noting that the liquid in both Car√∫pano XO and Legendario is obtained from private reserves belonging to the family that runs Car√∫pano.

According to the master rum blender, the blend was aged between 18 and 27 years, and with a unit price of $380 per bottle, I'd like to believe this is actually true. According to her, this rum is a tribute to Venezuelans, highlighting Venezuelan productos that are very appreciated  abroad: chocolate, rum (of course), and the desire to excel of Venezuelans who leave our country.

The Venezuelan DOC allows the addition of up to 5% of flavorings, maceration of fresh or dried fruit, bark, oak chips, and other substances authorized by the Ministry of Health before or after aging. This rum is macerated with Venezuelan cocoa. But it's not usually something most brands will admit and it caught me by surprise when the brand openly admitted it. This maceration likely takes place in a stainless steel vat.

Made by: Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano  
Name of the rum: XO  
Brand: Car√∫pano  
Origin: Venezuela  
Age: 18 to 27 years (per the brand)  
Price: $380 

**Nose:** A very strong and prominent chocolate note, dominant and almost exaggerated, accompanied by the typical toffee of a well-aged rum, almonds, floral notes, old wood, vanilla, coconut and iodine, or at least a sea air note.

**Palate:** The palate is lush, with strong chocolate notes again, but this time it doesn't allow for as many additional flavors to be appreciated as the additional aromas on the nose do. In addition to the chocolate, the flavors of raisins, coconut, creamy coffee, and wood stand out, with an almost infinite lingering taste, making the second sip feel like a second wave sweeping you onto the seashore and washing over you even further.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Chocolate, of course. 

**Rating:** 7 on the t8ke 

**Conclusion:** It's very common to see Carupano's product range and find the most expensive one, and then think that anything other than that one (called Legendario) won't be in the same league. But the fact is that the entire Carupano Collection line carries prices that are far beyond what the average Venezuelan can afford. For that reason, these are also rums for sipping on occasions, which again are far beyond what the average Venezuelan can afford to celebrate. But one thing is clear to me: being able to try this rum is cause for celebration.

Is it an expensive rum? Yes, quite a bit. Is it worth it? It depends. It's not a rum for everyone. That's why it's limited to 2,000 bottles per year. Would I buy it? Personally, no. Mainly because I'm not one of those people willing to pay more than $100 for a bottle of anything. But also because I've tried rums I liked much better for less than $100, and this one costs almost $400.

1kqdxav,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kqdxav/went_to_queensland_for_a_job_interview_and/,Went to Queensland for a job interview and accidentally unlocked a whole new reality,"I just got back from a solo trip and I‚Äôm seriously still processing everything that happened.
What was supposed to be a 2-day in-and-out job interview trip turned into a 5-day rom-com level blur and I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôve been living in Melbourne for years and never had an experience like this. But something about Queensland ‚Äî specifically the Gold Coast and Brisbane ‚Äî unlocked a different side of people I‚Äôd never seen before.

Here‚Äôs what happened, in order.


Day 1 ‚Äì Interview + Hotel drama + a Tinder match I wasn‚Äôt ready for
The interview itself was fine ‚Äî nothing too dramatic. I stayed at a nice hotel for two nights and decided to get the breakfast buffet the next morning‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt find it. Like, at all. Day two, I went to the front desk to ask where it was.

The blonde receptionist was cold and honestly pretty rude. She fired off directions I didn‚Äôt understand, and then threw in, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 10:20, you probably won‚Äôt get to eat anyway.‚Äù I asked if I could get a refund since I didn‚Äôt get to use what I paid for, and she just brushed me off like I was being annoying. Said it was ‚Äúincluded in the package‚Äù and walked away.

I know it‚Äôs not the end of the world, but it just felt really dismissive. I was tired, hungry, and frustrated, so I wrote a complaint email. Then I went down to check out ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when I met the duty manager.

And here‚Äôs the part that messed with my head.

He was really polite, apologetic, actually bought me a coffee and a sandwich from the caf√© next door. Said if I came back, I should message him directly and he‚Äôd personally upgrade my room. All very professional and kind ‚Äî and also he was‚Ä¶ really attractive. Tall, clean cut, kind of the ‚ÄúPinterest board‚Äù white guy you‚Äôd expect in a Hallmark movie. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt think too much about it and went on with my day.

That night, I opened Tinder ‚Äî and saw that I had matched with‚Ä¶ him.
The duty manager.
He had even messaged me already.

And the wildest part? We had matched before I filed the complaint. I just hadn‚Äôt seen it yet.
So now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering‚Ä¶ does he know?


Day 2 ‚Äì My Uber driver was‚Ä¶ way too hot and way too nice?
I switched hotels that evening and got picked up by a Brazilian Uber driver who was not only incredibly attractive but also super friendly and flirty. Before I got out of the car, he gave me his number and said, ‚ÄúText me if you need a ride to Brisbane tomorrow ‚Äî I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù

We‚Äôre still in contact. It felt natural. He asked my age. I asked his. It was one of those flirty conversations that didn‚Äôt feel weird, just kind of unexpected.



Same day ‚Äì The teppanyaki chef. Yes, really.
Later that night, I went out for dinner with a friend. The chef was totally my type ‚Äî tattoos, tanned skin, strong build, kind of mixed Asian (maybe Filipino?). He was performing while cooking and even wrote ‚Äúthank you‚Äù with a little heart on the grill.

So I asked for his number.

He gave it without hesitation. We texted that night, and honestly, if I didn‚Äôt have to leave early the next morning, I think something could‚Äôve happened.



Day 3 ‚Äì A guy from rednote (Chinese app) drove me from GC to Brisbane
I needed to get to Brisbane and the trains were down, so I posted on a Chinese social app. A Taiwanese guy offered to help. He drove me all the way there, refused to take money, and was incredibly respectful the entire way. I ended up treating him to lunch ‚Äî cost me $40, which is way cheaper than the $100+ Uber would‚Äôve been.

He wasn‚Äôt flirty or weird ‚Äî just warm and generous. We still follow each other and he said to hit him up if I‚Äôm ever back.



Day 4 ‚Äì Another student guy offered to help me check out and explore the city
A different guy I met on rednote, who goes to UQ, showed me around that night. Took me to dinner, showed me his campus, and was just very lowkey and kind.

The next morning ‚Äî again, totally unprompted ‚Äî he came to help me check out of my Airbnb, drove me to brunch, then shopping at DFO, and finally to the airport.

At some point during the drive, he said something that kind of stuck with me:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my type. Physically, and vibe-wise. But I‚Äôm more mature now ‚Äî I just appreciate beauty without needing to chase it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt really know what to say. That whole day was so unexpectedly generous. I‚Äôd just met him, and he went out of his way for me in a way I‚Äôve never experienced.


So now I‚Äôm back in Melbourne, and‚Ä¶ what??
I‚Äôm honestly still processing. I‚Äôve never experienced that kind of openness, friendliness, or interest in this city. In GC and Brisbane, it felt like people were just‚Ä¶ lighter? More direct? More open to connection?

I keep asking myself:
Was it the sun?
Was it my vibe?
Was it the off-season and I just stood out?
Was it just dumb luck?

Either way ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a long time since I felt that seen, appreciated, or even noticed. It was chaotic, affirming, funny, and yes ‚Äî a little bit confusing.

Also: do I text the duty manager back?


(And before anyone asks ‚Äî yes, this is all real. It sounds like fiction, I know. But it happened. I swear on my overpriced airport coffee and that $40 teppanyaki meal. Melbourne could never.)

1kqdx9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1kqdx9p/is_this_really_working/,Is this really working?,"I am a 20yr old 235 lb male, about 5'9'' and approx 30% body fat. I am pretty moderately active, I am a student so i walk everywhere (average 9k steps a day) and for the last couple weeks I have been working a facilities job where I am doing a lot of walking, lifting and carrying (hitting 17-20k steps during work days). I also work at an ice cream shop about 12 hours a week that involves staying on my feet a lot, moving back and forth, and carrying stuff around. I also try to go to the gym to do 15-30min cardio sessions about three days a week.

Hence I calculate my maintenance calories (estimated from various online calculators and LLMs) to be about 2700 (a little higher on days I get extra gym time). 

Since I am a student I do not have access to a kitchen/fridge nor am i on a meal plan during this current post term summer session. So i eat out essentially everyday. I tend to eat pretty big meals/ over-order food and they are usually not good quality (a lot of Chinese food, italian food, wingstop/fried chicken... take a look at my post history in the various calorie count subs to see the types of meals I eat on a regular basis)

So I used to have this eating habits without thinking of weight loss (essentially these big take out meals for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner). Now that I started this weightloss plan a few weeks ago I essentially just stopped eating breakfast and lunch. I found that as long as I have my coffee fix in the morning (\~150-200 cals for my cold brew w/cream order) I am not really hungry until \~5-6pm. If I do get hungry I usually eat something small like greek yogurt or a protein shake, but I try to stay below 500 cal before dinner. Then for dinner I kind of eat whatever I want, not really worrying about the calories. 

Due to the increased recent activity and just eating less than before I *have* been dropping weight. The first cut I did for a few weeks in February got me to drop from \~247 lbs at my heaviest to \~237 in about 4 weeks. In march i did gain some weight back due to being on break where I was not strict about this plan and I went back up to 242lbs. I started top think about this one meal/deficit plan about 3.5 weeks ago and I am down to 234lbs which is my lowest in over a year. I weigh myself consistently with the same amount of clothes and the same time of morning to limit confounding variables. 

Is this really working or am i not really burning fat? I know the scale tells me i am and i feel i look better, but I think anyone trying to do weight loss would look at what i eat and tell me no way I am able to lose weight like this. ",1,1747666940.0,CICO,2,1.0,False

1kqdtpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1kqdtpr/calling_all_disney_people/,Calling all Disney people‚Ä¶,"I had the great fortune of staying at the Marriott Anaheim (work trip) and then immediately flying out to stay at the Swan in Orlando (vacation). So the reviews will be in a comparable season and business level. 

I stayed at the Marriott Anaheim for 6 nights. I have platinum status as well. They were able to get me into a room on the concierge lounge floor at 10:30am when I arrived. I totally didn‚Äôt expect that. Especially because I‚Äôm sure they can see I booked a discounted conference rate. The lounge wasn‚Äôt open on Saturday as the evening appetizers are served in the restaurant Friday and Saturday and breakfast is served in the restaurant Saturday and Sunday. I was surprised that when I went to cash in my appetizer voucher that I got to choose two. They were very delicious and were a whole meal themselves. Sundays breakfast was spectacular in the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know if they did a fancier menu because of Mother‚Äôs Day but there was a carving station. 10/10. The room was nice if a little dated in some areas. The balcony (which I think every room has) was very nice for relaxing since the weather was great outside. During the week the lounge breakfast was okay - the standard stuff. But they did let me bring in two guests (my coworkers) which was super nice of them. The appetizers were okay as well. Only two options every afternoon and I have allergies so it was really hit or miss for me. But my coworkers loved them. The lounge was never really crowded which is good because it‚Äôs quite small. This might also have been because they let you pile up a plate and take it to go. I never saw the desert options which run after the appetizers. The rest of the day you can go in and get fruit, coffee, juice, and water. This lounge has no free alcohol but there is alcohol to purchase but like $10 for a beer. The walk to Disney is long and hot - it‚Äôs about a mile. I had heard terrible things about the ART bus system but you can walk over to the Toy Story lot and take the parking shuttle bus for free. It doesn‚Äôt save time, actually takes a little longer and still is a bit of a walk, but not nearly as much. 

I did 2 nights at the Swan. I had put in for a SNA and got it. I got upgraded to a resort view with a balcony but my room was not ready by my 3pm arrival. I got the notification a little after 4 that my room was ready. The room was nice and spacious. There were two sinks which was nice and very plushy towels. It seemed like the room was on the newer side. The doors slammed though and you kind of had to let them otherwise they didn‚Äôt close all the way. The boat is only quick to Hollywood studios. Walking to Epcot is faster but can be tiring in the heat. I used the boardwalks buses to get to animal kingdom. I didn‚Äôt go to magic kingdom on this trip but I likely would have used their bus too. There is obviously no lounge at the Swan or Dolphin and you have a nice $50 daily resort fee. I didn‚Äôt not really explore the resort benefits but the pools were nice. Some of their stands for food are only open Friday and Saturday so be mindful of that - as I told myself I would get something tomorrow only to find out it was closed. They do have a wonderful firm pillow as one of the options on the bed. TBH one of the best hotel pillows I‚Äôve ever used. The Swan also gets you into the parks 30 min early and evening hours on Monday and Wednesdays. I don‚Äôt think I would stay there if I didn‚Äôt have points to burn.

I do not want to put my bf in the middle, what do I do now?","So the first few paragraphs will be background that is very important to understanding what happened. I will go quick but if you don‚Äôt want to read switch to the bottom half of the paragraphs. I know this is wordy this is four years of drama I‚Äôm trying to consolidate for anyone who reads this I really appreciate you. I really need all the advice I can get. Please be kind this is a really painful subject for me. 

So my bf and I are both 19 turning 20 in a few months. So technically she is not my mil but I have been with my bf since we were 16 so she‚Äôs been in my life for a long time and we are planning on getting married in the next couple years. 

Her disrespect of me started when I met her for the first time. My bf and I met online spent a year talking and then she flew to my home state with my bf to see a friend who lived there and we drove to see them. The morning after we first met we were supposed to meet at a coffee shop. She was running because she was hanging out with their friend when they were supposed to leave. My bf was trying to get her to hurry up and she was upset that he was telling her to hurry so she refused to leave the house leaving my mom and I at a restaurant for over four hours not telling anyone when she was going to show up. When she finally decided to show up she said my bf had schoolwork to get done‚Ä¶ totally lying for no reason. 

I could go into detail on other instances of disrespect while on that first meeting vacation but let‚Äôs just fast forward to more recent, what is relevant to today. 

My parents had been saving up for my graduation for high school and we were planning a cruise to Iceland. Once in a lifetime trip. We asked his mom and he wanted to go and his mom was like no I want to spend time with you. He was 5 months from 18 and his mom was like nope I‚Äôm the parent I said no. Then my parents offered for her or my boyfriend‚Äôs dad to go so they could spend time with him. His mom said no and since she was the custodial parent she said the father couldn‚Äôt go with my bf either.. literally 5 months from 18. The kicker in all of this? His father was on vacation the week of the cruise and she went on vacation with her bf. The week my bf could‚Äôve gone to Iceland he spent alone because his mom prevented him from a once in a lifetime trip because she ‚Äúwanted to spend time with him.‚Äù For what happened it is important to understand how controlling she is. 

This is what lead to the blow up between everyone. The next year I finished an associates degree so we decided to go take a trip (my family loves to travel.) we decided to fly to my boyfriend‚Äôs home state to see his family before we left. My boyfriend had been dishonest with my dad about something and my dad was mad about it. My dad never told my bf that he was mad, only me so my bf was never confronted. 

At some point I told my bf‚Äôs dad that my dad was upset. I did not see this as a really big deal, and I guess that was my fault I feel guilty about that a lot. I was not trying to stir the pot or something my parents are separated I at the time my dad and I were almost no contact. There was no drama to be had between the two families because I had basically no relationship with my dad. 

But a few days later we were planning on going on a long drive largely in the middle of nowehere to see my boyfriend‚Äôs grandparents. The second we got in the car my boyfriend‚Äôs dad started screaming at me and screamed at me the entire way to the grandparents house. I literally said nothing the whole time. I wanted to leave I tried to say something I was terrified. But he would scream more at me if I ever talked at all. As soon as he dropped us off at our hotel my boyfriend and I‚Äôs only request? Don‚Äôt involve my boyfriend‚Äôs mom in our disagreement. They were divorced and my bf was an adult, that should‚Äôve been respected. 

Well shortly after that on vacation my boyfriend calls his dad basically saying what he did wasn‚Äôt ok, give him space and leave his mother out of it again. He promised he would not. A few days later my boyfriend‚Äôs mom calls my boyfriend saying as soon as he gets back he needs immediately come to their home state to have ‚Äúfamily conversations‚Äù about me and I was not invited. My boyfriend said an immediate no and called his dad and was like what did you do. 

His dad said he was the ‚Äúpeace maker‚Äù of the family and he decided telling his mom was the right thing. My bf was like um.. there was no conflict between mom and I before you started something. And he did not tell my boyfriend‚Äôs mom that he trapped me in a car and all that. Only that my family and I were treating my bf badly and I was allowing it basically (not true) 

Anyway when my boyfriend refused to come she just unloads everything she dislikes about me over the phone. That she thinks I am rude, trying to baby trap him (because I said I wanted kids at some point), he better not ever get me pregnant because he‚Äôd be stuck with me, to go to in person college to ‚Äúmeet new people‚Äù and keep his options open, that I didn‚Äôt allow him to see his family, I was trying to keep him from her because when we stayed in their home state we had to stay in a hotel because I am extremely allergic to their pets, and that he needed to get an apartment that I didn‚Äôt live in so he could ‚Äúbring people over.‚Äù ‚Ä¶  I don‚Äôt care if he has friends over.. we all know what she meant by that. There‚Äôs plenty more where that came from but this is getting long. 

Really quick it is important to note that in our relationship which had been two and a half ish years at that point I had been out to see them like 8 times. My boyfriend had just moved in with us when this all went down like 6 months before  but already my family had paid for him to see his family twice at my request. Once without me and once I did come. We spent thanksgiving with them, I made her a dish to take to her boyfriend‚Äôs family‚Äôs house because she can‚Äôt cook really and wanted to make a good impression. To be nice I paid for all the ingredients and she forgot she needed a dish until 9 pm so I was at her house until 1 am making her a dish I wasn‚Äôt eating that I paid for while she was drunk. I have cleaned things in her house, hung out with her a lot, gone to see her mom in the nursing home and brought her gifts, sent her gifts for every occasion and sometimes just because, fed their pets, got up at 5:30 am multiple times to help her with stuff for her job and that is just what I‚Äôve done for her that I remember that doesn‚Äôt even count the father. It is not that I didn‚Äôt try and I was 18. 

Anyway, my boyfriend told his parents he wouldn‚Äôt be speaking to them anymore unless it was urgent until they apologized and promised not to talk about me anymore. His mom said she‚Äôd never stop voicing her concerns. So fast forward a year there has been almost no contact. We said no reaching out and she has never respected it calling my boyfriend over and over, liking and commenting on my social media posts, texting me ect. Anyway there has been no contact from us until May when my boyfriend‚Äôs grandmother unfortunately passed away. 


My boyfriend wants to be there for her funeral which they postponed so all the family could come in June. My boyfriend called his mom to tell her he is only coming to bury his grandmother, this does not mean things are fixed. He says on the phone call his mom seemed really apologetic saying that she knows what she did was wrong she went to therapy blah blah. He said she wanted to call me to apologize for everything that has happened. I took my boyfriend at his word and contacted his mom. 

We set up a time to talk. And it did not go as it had been sold to me at all. She never once said I‚Äôm sorry to me. She said everything that happed was a misunderstanding, she ‚Äúnever said she didn‚Äôt like me‚Äù or that she wanted my bf to breakup with me. She had those conversations when my boyfriend was in a hotel room with me so I heard plenty of things that she said. She said everything shy of that. I said some things she said just seemed kinda mean and she was just like ‚Äúmy boyfriend‚Äôs name, just misinterpreted what I said and told you I said things I didn‚Äôt say.‚Äù It seemed awkward to be like ‚Äúum we were in a hotel room I heard it and you‚Äôre lying ‚Äú so I didn‚Äôt. 

She said my boyfriend didn‚Äôt communicate well, and I should‚Äôve communicated what happened with my boyfriend‚Äôs dad with her. Which I would‚Äôve done if she called my boyfriend and said ‚Äúyour dad is saying some things I want to hear your side.‚Äù Instead of calling my boyfriend going off about me. But I was genuinely traumatized by what my boyfriend‚Äôs dad did and I didn‚Äôt want to get into a war between my boyfriend‚Äôs mom, dad, me and my boyfriend about a he said she said thing. I just didn‚Äôt have it in me. But she did not take any ownership over why I might not have felt safe talking to her. 

So anyway she said that was my fault or it was my boyfriend‚Äôs fault or it was his dad‚Äôs fault for what he did and everything I thought was her fault was actually a misunderstanding or someone else‚Äôs fault for how they handled it. I was the victim genuinely and I apologized multiple times. I apologized because she thought I was rude and 8 I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm autistic sometimes I am just socially unaware but I meant no harm I swear.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt get diagnosed until I was 18 you really wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell no one ever is. It had nothing to do with autism, I am perfectly capable of being like ‚Äúyeah sorry I was being a bitch‚Äù but the things she said I did didn‚Äôt even happen they literally didn‚Äôt. 

She said that we believed she was controlling but she talked to a therapist and they decided she wasn‚Äôt controlling‚Ä¶ a very different story than the one I had been told about what she‚Äôd say when I got on the phone with her. When my boyfriend quit talking to her she started contacting my parents trying to get them involved. She quite literally was trying to contact my parents so they would turn against my boyfriend and I in a conflict I was not even directly involved in because my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt talking to her. And she felt it was my fault that my boyfriend was upset about her actions. We were adults and he had been moved out for almost a year at that point, she had no right to involve them. 

While we were out of town she said she was no longer paying my boyfriend‚Äôs insurance, literally because she was mad. She still had the title to his car. She said if he didn‚Äôt find insurance and pay it she was going to fly to the state where we live and drive his car to where she lived and take it. Because she didn‚Äôt want an uninsured care in her name.. that no one was driving sitting in the driveway‚Ä¶ whatever. My boyfriend was out of town there was literally nothing he could do.  They figured it out he kept his car but the whole thing was really unnecessary. 

I should‚Äôve known better than to ever call her. I know a person cannot change that much. My boyfriend seemed so sure and he has hated us disagreeing. I should‚Äôve just been like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you and your mom worked it out but no.‚Äù And just seen if she could keep up being nice to him. I just hated seeing him living in this and if there was a chance we could get along so my boyfriend‚Äôs family didn‚Äôt have to be at odds I wanted him to have that. I should‚Äôve gone with my gut and not broken no contact but I didn‚Äôt. 

The most honesty she has ever given is that she is jealous of me and all the things I get to do with my boyfriend. And that is the truth, which she didn‚Äôt say to me she said to my boyfriend. But that is the real reason for all of this. That and that she genuinely does want to control him. She projects her desires to control him on me, I don‚Äôt want to, but she definitely does. That is the truth about all of this. 

I feel awful about all of this. I should‚Äôve covered up the fact that my boyfriend was lying, I should‚Äôve never told my boyfriend‚Äôs dad there was a problem, I should‚Äôve maybe done something around his mom been nicer something, I should‚Äôve never called his mom. 

At the end of the call I told his mom that we were good, because I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I felt it was wrong to argue with my boyfriend‚Äôs mom without talking about it with him first. I feel horrible for saying that we were good knowing we weren‚Äôt but I had no idea what to do. 

I want so badly to get along with his family. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work. I feel awful for putting my boyfriend in the middle. I never wanted any of this I came from a broken family and I wanted very badly to have a great ideal family with great relationships with my in laws. My boyfriend feels bad like it‚Äôs all his fault. He feels like lying to my parents is what started it all and is the reason for all my pain, he feels bad that he doesn‚Äôt just cut his mom off. 

He feels like he is not a man or protecting me because he doesn‚Äôt. I feel bad that he feels that way. I don‚Äôt want him to have to choose and he doesn‚Äôt he could have an arms length relationship with her but she is very good at manipulating and upsetting him. She knows exactly what to say to make him feel guilty and exactly what to say to get him to do what she wants. I don‚Äôt think any amount of therapy will ever make it not that way because it has been something she has been doing his whole life. My boyfriend tries to see the best in her. I knew from the moment I got on the phone with her that she wasn‚Äôt sorry and she was playing him. He genuinely believed she was even though I was like ‚Äúdid she ever say sorry.‚Äù And he was like no but she was explaining it I thought she was. Am I was like she was explaining how it was your fault that is not being sorry. 

He wants to know what I want and at this point I don‚Äôt know. If he his mom off the guilt will eat me alive. He wants it to go back to the way it was for the last year where they didn‚Äôt talk much. But we want kids in our early 20s this won‚Äôt be a long term solution she will never just disappear once there are children. 

Of course a person can have a distance relationship with their parents but seeing how well she manipulates him and yes he has been in therapy I just don‚Äôt see how that can happen. If you read all of my word vomit I greatly appreciate it I really need all the advice I can get.

Our LO had an amazing time meeting all the characters so we had spent the majority of time waiting in line, which was a bit exhausting. LO also did not enjoy the splash pad since LO got a bit overwhelmed by the crowd. The frozen dinner was worth paying for the cruise since LO was in awe and wonder during the dinner show. This dinner itself was worth paying for this trip since our toddler is a huge Frozen fan. Definitely ask the main dinner manager if there are any tables near the stage. Our server could not accommodate, but the main manager kindly looked further into the seating to get us a nicer table! 

Because of all the excitement, LO refused to nap and would be prone to tantrum. But on the second day, LO did collapse in the stroller from exhaustion. But LO was still waking up at 6am every morning, and we were exhausted since we all went to bed around 10:30am

The post dinner shows were really amazing, especially the Sea of Adventure (I think that‚Äôs the name). Aladdin (last day) was a bit more dialogue heavy so our toddler didn‚Äôt enjoy as much.

Food on Wish was good! Nothing amazing, but the variety kept our interests and our toddler was happy with the offerings.

Coffee by the pool deck was not so great‚Äîfelt like drinking some sort of black sludge water.

Here are my main thoughts on 3 nights Wish:

1. if you have a little girl, pack all of the Disney princesses dresses she enjoys. We were not able to secure any BB boutique appointments;

2. 2-day Rainforest pass was very nice to have since showering at the spa was much nicer than the room bathroom due to the water pressure being so weak. I do think massage sessions are a bit overpriced, but having the pass was plenty relaxing even for one hour per day (if you can manage to get away from your toddler for a bit);

3. Expect to wait in line most of the days if your child likes meeting characters;

4. Go to Castaway early and then come back for lunch since the ship is quiet by then and we got to enjoy some downtime and also snuck in the water slide time with min wait (it did get busy after 2pm);

5. Arrive one day earlier and request DCL transportation going to the port if you are departing from Part Canaveral, the whole process was very easy and also we had a good time staying at French Quarter, visiting Disney Spring to kick off our cruise vacation;

6. Bring your own snacks like apple sauce pouch or crackers as the ship doesn‚Äôt really have toddler friendly snacks (but plenty of food and ice cream);

7. Definitely treat Nassau as your Sea day.

In fact, I think it is the best plot, right after XC1. The premise, lore etc. is pretty good. I love how the plot actually addresses things like language (and how different species wouldn't even be able to produce the same sounds), how Mimeosomes function (pain, tears, hunger etc.) and more.

However, among all that brilliance, I think that XCX is hard to be taken seriously because of some outright silly stuff.

First and foremost, I think it is just weird how mankind is on the brink of extiction, having energy left only for a couple of months, is having trouble with local species, have no idea where the lifehold is, eventually find themselves amid a war (with other species outright stating they want to kill mankind) and... are perfectly fine in ASKING for people to voluntary join BLADE.

No pressure or anything. Sure, things are awfully dire, but you are free to just go around, use resources, maybe go shopping, have a coffee at the local starbucks etc. if you aren't feeling like giving a hand.

Not only that, but we have mankind reduced to a single city and yet, economy is somehow a thing. Not only economy, but capitalism, first and foremost. There are characters and companies worried about profit (which, somehow, is actually the most believable thing among all the stuff the game presents), the provisional government needs to work with budget and funds in mind and so on.

This is absolutely nuts. In such scenario, the most obvious thing that would happen is that any sort of provisional government would force everybody to be productive and work towards a goal. Resources would be strictly controlled (this means that making foie gras isn't an option, Lyn) and all sorts af facism and authoritarism shit would be happening since day one (in fact, it is such a missed plot. Waking up in another planet and struggling to fight for humanity while also having to deal with a brutal and oppressive government would be a treasure trove for the narrative).

Meanwhile, we also have Lao being seen as a traitor, and yet, being left to his own devices. By the time he steals Prog Aries and the data in Chapter 11 or so, Elma going ""I just had a suspicion!"" when Lao outright spits truth at them feels comical.



""It seems like Lao led a lot of Blades into traps and is actively trying to sabotage our goal, shouldn't we do something?""

""Nah, he is our friend! We should let him explain himself!""

\*months later\*

""What the hell, Lao?"" with the most shocked Pikachu face possible

One of them asked to meet up and seemed super chill about it, wanting a proper date and everything, which is really unlike the regular Netflix and chill situations. 

Long story short, we met up. We had a few drinks, and everything was going super well, like yapping non-stop. It got late, and we ended up around his... what a coincidence. We had fun for hours, like literal hours. It was amazing, and we cuddled all night just to repeat it in the morning. 

He had work the next day, so we got up and went for coffee before he had to go. We went our separate ways, and I got the bus back home. 

Since then, we've been on about 5 more dates. I really like this guy, to the point that on the second time I met him, I ignored everyone else I was talking to online. I haven't slept with anyone else, and my eyes are fully on him. 

The only thing is that his replies are so-so bad. Like 16 hours bad. He said he was sorry for it and he'd try to get better for me, but he just never goes on his phone. He works a lot, but everyone I've spoken to says, ""If he wanted to, he would"".

I asked for advice from my mum, and she said, ""Just ask him to be your boyfriend already"", but I feel like I'm rushing things that might be suspicious.

I'm quite available to chat throughout the day and would truly value connecting with someone (or a few someones!) to share the rhythm of daily life, explore our passions, and hopefully create a bond built on mutual understanding and genuine connection.

Here's a little about what brings me joy:

‚úçÔ∏è **Writing:** I find solace and expression in putting thoughts and stories onto paper. It's a way to reflect and connect with ideas.

üé® **Art (Drawing & Painting!):** There's something wonderful about both appreciating and creating art. It's a journey of self-expression and discovery.

üìö **Reading:** I love getting lost in a good book and exploring different perspectives and worlds.

‚úàÔ∏è **Traveling:** Experiencing new cultures and seeing the world broadens my horizons and offers invaluable insights.

üí™ **Gym & üßò Yoga:** I believe in nurturing both physical and mental well-being through staying active and finding inner peace.

üéÆ **Video Games:** I enjoy the social and storytelling aspects of gaming and the chance to unwind in different virtual realms.

üó£Ô∏è **Learning Languages:** The process of learning French and Japanese is fascinating, opening up new ways to connect with others and understand different cultures.

‚òï **Coffee & üçµ Tea:** I truly appreciate the simple pleasure of a good cup and the moments of reflection it can bring.

I'm hoping to find someone who values open communication, empathy, and the joy of sharing life's moments, big or small. I'm a good listener and value creating a supportive and understanding friendship.

So, what's a book that has particularly moved you, or is there an artist whose work you find deeply inspiring?

During a recent visit to Pune, I found myself immersed in a treasure trove of [furniture](https://soulwoodventures.com/products/) and design inspiration at Soulwood Ventures, a sprawling five-storey showroom nestled in Kondhwa. Known for their commitment to solid wood, intelligent layouts, and tailored interiors, the space offers far more than just furniture‚Äîit‚Äôs a design experience.

While wandering through their neatly segmented floors, the Modular Kitchens caught my attention. Tucked beside elegant [dining sets](https://soulwoodventures.com/dining/) and across from gleaming Wardrobes, these kitchens weren‚Äôt just about utility; they were about expression, comfort, and smart living. The blend of function and form was apparent in every drawer, cabinet, and countertop. But more than anything, they felt personal.

# What Makes a Kitchen ‚ÄòModular‚Äô?

A modular kitchen is, at its core, a well-structured ensemble of standardised units‚Äîcabinets, drawers, pull-outs, and racks‚Äîeach designed to make cooking more efficient and visually pleasing. At Soulwood Ventures, the kitchens are engineered for real life, not just showroom sparkle.

Each layout is designed to accommodate everyday cooking needs, from prepping spicy Indian gravies to baking European desserts. I noticed intelligent zoning‚Äîwet, dry, and cooking spaces were demarcated. The modularity allows for mixing and matching finishes, shapes, and functions to suit the size and flow of any home.

In contrast to traditional carpenter-made kitchens, modular systems at Soulwood Ventures promote cleanliness, easy maintenance, and long-term durability. Whether you‚Äôre designing a compact kitchenette or a large, open-plan kitchen-dining area, modularity offers flexibility like no other.

Benefits of Modular Kitchens

Walking through the sample kitchens on display, I was struck by how much *space* these designs actually create, especially when you don‚Äôt have a lot of it. Every corner is optimised. Pull-out spice racks tucked into slim columns, deep drawers for large pots, and corner carousels that rotate out with a whisper‚Äîeverything feels engineered for ease.

Beyond space-saving, modular kitchens also bring unmatched elegance to the home. At Soulwood Ventures, you can choose from a variety of finishes‚Äîacrylic gloss, matte laminates, or natural wood grains‚Äîthat either complement or contrast with other rooms. Their kitchen setups harmonise beautifully with their [chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/chairs/), TV Units, and centre [tables](https://soulwoodventures.com/tables/), reflecting a unified design ethos across the home.

Another standout is the modularity‚Äôs repairability. If something chips or breaks, you don't have to redo the whole kitchen. You can simply replace a single module. That‚Äôs a future-proof solution any homeowner can appreciate.

Soulwood Ventures‚Äô Approach to Modular Kitchen Design

It‚Äôs easy to assume modular kitchens are a one-size-fits-all solution. But not at Soulwood Ventures. Here, every kitchen is an experience tailored to its user. Collaborating with brands like Fine Edge Modular Furniture and Stellum, they bring to life intelligent, modern kitchen concepts rooted in both global design trends and Indian practicality.

The team seems to understand that today‚Äôs homeowner wants more than just a cooking space. They want a space to entertain, to relax, and to express themselves. Whether it‚Äôs pairing your kitchen cabinetry with an adjoining Dining Chair set or coordinating finishes with nearby Consoles, their offerings bridge functionality with aesthetics effortlessly.

There‚Äôs also a strong sense of cohesion throughout the showroom. A kitchen unit that opens up into a lounge area is matched beautifully with [sofas](https://soulwoodventures.com/sofas/) and Indoor Swings, echoing the same tones and materials. It all felt like stepping into a thoughtfully designed home.

# Space-Saving Solutions for Compact Homes

In Pune's bustling and ever-evolving urban landscape, where space is considered a luxury, every square foot matters. As cities continue to grow and living spaces shrink, the need for intelligent and efficient design has never been greater. Soulwood Ventures, with its extensive range of modular kitchen designs, clearly understands this modern challenge. Through clever design and a commitment to quality craftsmanship, they have demonstrated how even a small 100-square-foot kitchen can be transformed into a fully functional and stylish space.

One of the standout displays that caught my eye featured an L-shaped kitchen layout. The design maximised every corner of the space, with upper cabinets running right up to the ceiling. This simple yet effective design choice creates additional storage space, perfect for seasonal items, kitchen appliances, or less frequently used cookware. It's a design that cleverly hides clutter while still providing easy access to everything you need. By utilising vertical space, they ensure that nothing goes to waste, allowing homeowners to make the most of every inch.

In another setup, I encountered a U-shaped kitchen that showcased the versatility of modular designs. What stood out in this kitchen was how it integrated a cosy breakfast nook with space-saving Stools that could be tucked away when not in use. This is an excellent solution for smaller families or those who entertain occasionally. The nook added a charming touch to the design without feeling cramped, making it perfect for quick meals or casual conversations over coffee. These types of design choices are ideal for urban homes, where every square inch needs to be optimised.

The modular kitchen designs at Soulwood Ventures don't just focus on storage within the cabinets; the clever integration of pull-out pantries and vertical tray organisers adds a further layer of organisation to the kitchen. These features make use of otherwise wasted space, such as narrow gaps between appliances and cabinetry, to offer easily accessible storage for dry goods, canned food, or kitchen tools. For homes with limited storage, these innovative solutions are game-changers. Pull-out trays allow for the seamless organisation of spices, oils, and sauces, making them easy to reach while cooking. It‚Äôs all about creating more space where seemingly there is none.

But Soulwood Ventures‚Äô commitment to space-saving solutions doesn‚Äôt stop at just kitchens. As I wandered through the rest of the showroom, it was clear that their entire range of furniture was designed with the same thoughtful consideration for limited space. Beds with built-in under-storage provided a practical solution for urban dwellers with limited closet space. The drawers beneath the bed are large enough to store anything from linens to seasonal clothing, ensuring that no space goes unused.

Similarly, Writing Tables were designed with hidden compartments that helped keep the workspace tidy and organised. The ability to store paperwork, office supplies, or electronics in discrete drawers makes these desks both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Even [office furniture](https://soulwoodventures.com/office-furniture/) was designed with flexibility in mind‚Äîpieces that fold, adjust, or stack provide versatility for home offices that may need to double up as guest rooms or other multi-purpose spaces. These smart design choices ensure that compact homes are not only functional but can also cater to changing needs over time.

This emphasis on space-saving, however, doesn‚Äôt come at the cost of style. Soulwood Ventures combines practicality with beauty, offering designs that elevate the look and feel of the space. The result is a home that feels open and airy, without the clutter that often accompanies small living spaces. It‚Äôs a testament to their design ethos‚Äîfunctionality and style are not mutually exclusive, and every piece of furniture is crafted to reflect that philosophy.

# Material and Finish Options That Elevate Style

One of the standout features of Soulwood Ventures' [modular kitchens](https://soulwoodventures.com/modular-kitchen/) is the ability to personalise each design through a wide selection of materials and finishes. When I visited, I was immediately drawn to the material samples and swatches they provided, inviting visitors to touch and feel the quality of each option. From marine-grade plywood to moisture-resistant laminates, the kitchen units were made to withstand the demands of daily use while maintaining their visual appeal. This attention to quality ensures that the kitchen remains durable and stylish for years, even with heavy use.

What truly captured my attention was a matte-finished kitchen in a dusty teal tone. The understated elegance of the colour, paired with sleek brass handles, created a refined, contemporary look that was both chic and timeless. It was a striking example of how colour and texture can transform the mood of a space. The matte finish not only added depth to the design but also contrasted beautifully with the brass hardware, giving the kitchen a sophisticated, modern flair.

Another design that stood out was a kitchen with wood-textured laminate that gave the appearance of natural wood. This texture was not only visually stunning but also echoed the same warmth and authenticity found in other parts of the showroom, such as the [Indian sittings](https://soulwoodventures.com/indian-sitting/) and [sun loungers](https://soulwoodventures.com/sun-loungers/). The consistency of materials across different pieces in the showroom creates a cohesive aesthetic that flows seamlessly from room to room. The use of wood textures in the kitchen helped to tie the space to other elements of the home, creating an environment where all the furniture and design choices felt connected.

This flexibility in material choices allows homeowners to align their kitchen with their overall home palette, whether they prefer a modern minimalist look or an earthy, traditional feel. The ability to choose between high-gloss finishes, matte textures, and natural wood grains provides the perfect opportunity for self-expression. Whether you lean toward a sleek, contemporary design or a more rustic, homely vibe, Soulwood Ventures offers the materials and finishes that can make any vision come to life.

The variety of finishes also ensures that the kitchen design can work harmoniously with other furniture in the home. The Sofas, Dining Sets, [TV units](https://soulwoodventures.com/tv-units/), and [consoles](https://soulwoodventures.com/consoles/) in the showroom all reflected a similar design philosophy‚Äîthoughtfully crafted, quality-focused, and designed to make your home a functional yet stylish haven. Whether you're looking to create a contemporary kitchen that complements the rest of your living space or prefer a more traditional setup that echoes the earthy tones of your [dining chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/dining-chairs/) and [wardrobes](https://soulwoodventures.com/wooden-framing-wardrobes/), Soulwood Ventures ensures that you have the tools to create a space that's uniquely yours.

The marriage of practical storage solutions and stylish finishes at Soulwood Ventures is a true celebration of modern living. It shows that with the right planning and the right materials, even a small, compact kitchen can become a stylish and functional heart of the home. The flexibility in design, combined with the thoughtful attention to detail, proves that small spaces need not be limited by their size, only by the imagination of the designer and homeowner.

# The Role of Lighting and Ventilation

Lighting, I learned, can transform a kitchen. Soulwood Ventures showcases this perfectly with ambient under-cabinet LEDs that cast a soft glow on countertops. The task lighting over cooking zones, concealed strip lights inside deep drawers, and pendant lighting over island counters all combine to enhance functionality and mood.

Ventilation is also prioritised. Chimneys are seamlessly built into wall units, and many displays include modular overhead cabinets designed to allow proper airflow. Large windows and exhaust provisions ensure that Indian cooking, rich in spices and aromas, never becomes overwhelming.

Good lighting and ventilation might sound like afterthoughts, but at Soulwood Ventures, they‚Äôre design fundamentals. It‚Äôs a refreshing approach that homeowners would do well to consider.

# Storage Innovations in Modern Modular Kitchens

Storage is where modular kitchens shine, and Soulwood Ventures doesn‚Äôt hold back. Think pull-out drawers with in-built organisers, tall units with adjustable shelving, hidden garbage compartments, and corner units that utilise every last inch.

One of my favourite finds was a slide-out pantry that extended fully with a single tug, housing everything from snacks to cookware. Another was a dish-drying rack hidden inside an overhead cabinet, complete with drip trays and air circulation.

It‚Äôs not just about fitting more, it‚Äôs about smarter placement. These same principles carry into their Wardrobes with compartmentalised storage, Office Chairs that tuck neatly under workstations, and multi-purpose [bar chairs](https://soulwoodventures.com/bar-chairs/) that also serve as reading nooks.

# Integrating Appliances Seamlessly

Built-in appliances are no longer a luxury‚Äîthey‚Äôre a necessity in modern kitchens. Soulwood Ventures understands this shift. The modular kitchens on display were equipped with integrated ovens, microwaves, dishwashers, and induction cooktops that melt into the cabinetry.

A wall-mounted oven sat between two tall cabinets in one setup, its sleek design matching the surrounding drawers. Refrigerators were often hidden behind matching panels, keeping the visual flow uninterrupted. Its design is with discretion‚Äîfunctionality without compromise on style.

These integrations pair well with other built-in elements throughout the showroom. From TV Units that house media consoles to [beds](https://soulwoodventures.com/beds/) with concealed headboard shelves, the idea is always to keep things seamless, clutter-free, and beautiful.

# Customisation for Indian Cooking Needs

Indian kitchens come with specific requirements‚Äîlarge pressure cookers, spice jars, masalas, and wet grinding. Soulwood Ventures nails this aspect with layouts and modules tailored to desi needs.

The spice pull-outs, oil trays, and heavy-duty drawers for steel utensils are designed with Indian cooking in mind. Separate zones for prep, cooking, and washing ensure that multiple people can work together without crowding. I even saw a modular unit that housed a small indoor tandoor‚Äîimpressive and imaginative.

It‚Äôs thoughtful additions like these that make their kitchens feel genuinely usable. The same philosophy is evident in their other offerings‚Äî[indoor swings](https://soulwoodventures.com/indoor-swings/) that balance tradition with modern design, and Dining Chairs that are both ergonomic and stylish for long family meals.

# Choosing the Right Modular Kitchen for Your Home

Choosing a modular kitchen can be daunting. At Soulwood Ventures, I appreciated how each display included not just furniture but suggested combinations, from [centre tables](https://soulwoodventures.com/center-table/) to Consoles, allowing visitors to visualise the entire living experience.

As a homeowner or renovator, you‚Äôd want to consider your daily habits, cooking style, and family size. Do you need a breakfast counter? Extra storage for bulk groceries? A designated coffee station? The team here encourages you to think through it all, even if you‚Äôre just browsing.

Their showroom is more than a place to pick furniture‚Äîit‚Äôs a place to imagine your home. It‚Äôs where Office Furniture coexists gracefully with Bar Chairs, and where design meets real-life use.

# Conclusion: A Kitchen that Reflects Your Lifestyle

My visit to Soulwood Ventures left me with more than just aesthetic delight‚Äîit reshaped how I see home design. A modular kitchen is not just a trend; it‚Äôs a lifestyle upgrade. One that merges form, function, and finesse in deeply personal ways.

If you‚Äôre looking to explore modular kitchens or even just wander through an inspiring space filled with beautiful sofas, beds, [stools](https://soulwoodventures.com/stools/), and [other accessories](https://soulwoodventures.com/other-accesories/), this showroom in Pune is worth your time.

1kqdd9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kqdd9b/four_more_miles_original_story/,Four More Miles *Original Story*,"A long drive, as it usually is, feels almost unbearable. The road continues to stretch as far as the lights will allow it. Only 4 more miles left. ‚ÄúThank God.‚Äù The traffic light approaches, burning red at the intersection. The sounds of street lamps are overwhelmingly loud, but maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm restless. It‚Äôs been a rainy and cold June‚Äîno signs of a approaching summer anytime soon.

Green‚Äîthe change of the light is aggressive. It startles my hands off my lap and back onto the wheel. Everything is bolder when you are alone. I continue down the road, the same drive I‚Äôve made numerous times. I can see the turns (very few), the potholes‚Äîall etched into the back of my mind‚Äîallowing me to let the machine do the heavy lifting. I can barely keep my eyes open. The coffee I got on the way is now cold. I never touch it at first because they always serve it too hot, so it just tends to rest in the cup holder. It hasn‚Äôt seemed to help anyway. Hell, it never does. Who am I kidding?

This road trip I call my ride home drags‚Äî12 miles of a dead silent straight shot. No turns, nothing. At least that‚Äôs over. The shit-hole I call home should be coming up soon, but in the distance something looks different. There‚Äôs something in the road, directly in the center, beaconing out like a lonely lighthouse. Luckily, it‚Äôs a 4-lane, so I can drive around easily. I still want to be cautious, so I come creeping alongside it. It‚Äôs a bicycle‚Äîan abandoned silver and blue 10-speed. Laid flat on its side. Oddly, it looks to be in perfect order. Strange, but nothing that out of the ordinary.

Except that the street lights are out. They‚Äôve always bothered me because it felt like they were never-ending. But without them, the road feels dead.

‚ÄúWhatever. Must be a power outage,‚Äù I murmur to myself in a quiet growl. They happen. Driving, driving, DRIVING. They say you get used to it after a while, but this dull drive would even bother the most seasoned truck drivers.

GREEN. The light snaps. What the fuck? I dozed off? That was a dream? When did I pull over? I know I was tired, but that‚Äôs not something you typically forget.

4 more miles. How great.

I notice my coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs warm. Hot, even. How? I‚Äôve had it for at least 2 hours, depending on how long I‚Äôve been asleep for as well. Going to check my watch. It‚Äôs dead. Stuck at 9:47 PM. Shitty watch anyway, but that‚Äôs what I get for using digital.

I put the car in drive. The light has been green for an eternity, so I continue as I was. Anxiously, I‚Äôm coming closer to where I initially thought I was before I sprung back to life like some crazed creature. I notice something in the center of the road‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs a bicycle? A 10-speed? Rusted with the faint memory of the blue and silver it once was. I knew it before I even got close enough to see it. It‚Äôs the same one I just saw‚Äîbut it can‚Äôt be. I didn‚Äôt see it, did I?

It‚Äôs all the same. The street lights‚Äîbrighter than 1,000 suns.

I need to get home. I keep repeating that in my head over and over and over.

The road continues. It feels longer and longer as I keep going. Turning on the blinker to the lot that I call home‚Äîturning catches me by surprise, as when I pull into the lot, there is nothing there. Just flat, paved ground.

Exploring Lisbon's culinary delights doesn't have to weigh on your conscience. Delicious and guilt-free options are plentiful in this vibrant city, allowing you to savor flavors while taking care of your health.

Start your day with pastel de nata, Portugal's iconic egg custard tart. Indulge in a lighter version made with almond milk for a guilt-free twist. Pair it with a cup of freshly brewed coffee to kickstart your morning.

For lunch, seek out the charming mercados scattered throughout the city. Mercado da Ribeira, for instance, offers a selection of fresh vegetables and grilled fish. Opt for a hearty sardinha assada (grilled sardines) that‚Äôs packed with omega-3 fatty acids and served with a side of seasonal greens.

As the afternoon approaches, indulge in gr√£o de bico (chickpeas) prepared in various ways: from hearty stews to simple salads. Rich in protein and fiber, this staple will keep you satiated without the added guilt.


Chickpea stew - a wholesome option that combines spices and vegetables.
Vegetable piri-piri skewers - grilled to perfection and bursting with flavor.
Acai bowls - a sweet treat packed with nutrients, available in many local cafes.


As the sun sets, consider dining at a local tasca that serves options like cataplana de peixe (seafood stew) made with fresh, sustainable ingredients. This dish is rich in nutrients and light on the palate, perfect for an evening meal.

With these guilt-free options, enjoying Lisbon‚Äôs remarkable cuisine becomes a wholesome experience that delights both the taste buds and the mind.

Do I have cause to complain and rebook? [Croatia],"TLDR: Meh-ish apartment not as nice as advertized, super sketchy building. I'd rather move. Do I have recourse?

Renting an apartment in Rijeka, Croatia for a few weeks. Professionally managed so to speak from a major apartment/real estate co here. I know that places tend to look better in the photos, but the other apartments I've stayed in here have consistently met or exceeded expectations. This one less so.

The apartment itself is ok-ish. Definitely not as well lit, cozy, and well maintained as the photos. The furniture is a lot more worn down, and things like decorative couch pillows etc MIA. Big area rug in the living room missing and cavernous. Various light bulbs out or lights not working. The light fixture in the bathroom doesn't work and just has wires sticking out. No hooks at all in the washroom (there is some in the photos). Desk chair which is a nice leather one with armrests in photos, is a basic worn out armless one irl (important cause this is a working trip). Virtually unstocked - no starter coffee pods, dishwasher tabs etc. All in all just pretty underwhelming/not as nice as expected especially from a commercial management company.

But particularly...notable is the building which feels like something out of a cut scene from a horror game. I've stayed in plenty of apts here and in europe and don't judge a book by it's cover. I've been in plenty of really nice apartments in buildings very much showing their significant age. This one though... the front hall is grungy, with bags of who knows what - garbage? reno materials? lining the hallway, and it smells like piss (which I'm quite sure it literally is). It's a five storey walk-up on some poorly maintained stairs, to the attic-floor of the building which looks like the hallway to a serial killer's dungeon. Grungy, dirty, half-finshied doors, holes in the wall/floor to the outside (made by human or animal? who knows!), etc.

I know I'm renting the apartment not the building but I expected more from a professionally managed unit and feel it's reasonable to expect some minimum level of decent condition/safety of the building.

I booked relatively last minute and stupidly did not look at reviews for the place on other sites like [booking.com](http://booking.com) which did speak to some of these elements. So it's pretty suspicious that there is only a single positive review on AirBnB. I guess I gave too much credit to the company which seems normally pretty legit.

Honestly I'd like to cancel and go find somewhere else. Either immediately or in a few days when some places I want are available. But not sure I have the grounds to get anything more than whatever the 50% refund for unused days gets me. Do I have any grounds to complain here?",1,1747665408.0,AirBnB,1,1.0,False

His family lives about 3 hours away, and they visit every 3 months or so. For context, I‚Äôm his first serious girlfriend, and he wasn‚Äôt able to date openly in high school, so his parents have never really had to ‚Äúshare‚Äù their son before. I‚Äôve tried to give them grace and be understanding of that. I get along well with his siblings, but his parents are harder to connect with.

I‚Äôm pretty introverted and I know my body language can sometimes come across as closed off, even if I don‚Äôt mean it that way. His family is loud, opinionated, and very close with each other‚Äîwhich is fine, but hard for me to jump into. Often when I‚Äôm there, everyone just watches TV and doesn‚Äôt really engage in much conversation, so I‚Äôm not sure how to connect or make progress. My boyfriend has expressed that he‚Äôs frustrated I haven‚Äôt gotten closer to them and says it seems like I shut down around them.

To add to the pressure, his mom recently told him that she thinks I hate them, though she said she wants to try grabbing coffee or doing something with just his sister and me. I‚Äôm open to that, but also really nervous because I already feel like they dislike me‚Äîand no one really talks to me when I‚Äôm there, so I don‚Äôt know how to fix this.

To complicate things further, my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really interact with my family either. My parents live just 45 minutes away, but they‚Äôre more private and home-oriented, so he‚Äôs only been around them a few times. He says he feels like they expect him to please me and don‚Äôt actually care to get to know him, which hurts me‚Äîespecially since I spend way more time with his family despite feeling so disconnected.

I‚Äôm starting to feel a lot of anxiety about this dynamic and worried that if it doesn‚Äôt improve, it could damage our relationship. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do, and it‚Äôs weighing on me.

But something about Queensland ‚Äî specifically the Gold Coast and Brisbane ‚Äî unlocked a different side of people I‚Äôd never seen before.

Here‚Äôs what happened, in order.


Day 1 ‚Äì Interview + Hotel drama + a Tinder match I wasn‚Äôt ready for
The interview itself was fine ‚Äî nothing too dramatic. I stayed at a nice hotel for two nights and decided to get the breakfast buffet the next morning‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt find it. Like, at all. Day two, I went to the front desk to ask where it was.

The blonde receptionist was cold and honestly pretty rude. She fired off directions I didn‚Äôt understand, and then threw in, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 10:20, you probably won‚Äôt get to eat anyway.‚Äù I asked if I could get a refund since I didn‚Äôt get to use what I paid for, and she just brushed me off like I was being annoying. Said it was ‚Äúincluded in the package‚Äù and walked away.

I know it‚Äôs not the end of the world, but it just felt really dismissive. I was tired, hungry, and frustrated, so I wrote a complaint email. Then I went down to check out ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when I met the duty manager.

And here‚Äôs the part that messed with my head.

He was really polite, apologetic, actually bought me a coffee and a sandwich from the caf√© next door. Said if I came back, I should message him directly and he‚Äôd personally upgrade my room. All very professional and kind ‚Äî and also he was‚Ä¶ really attractive. Tall, clean cut, kind of the ‚ÄúPinterest board‚Äù white guy you‚Äôd expect in a Hallmark movie. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt think too much about it and went on with my day.

That night, I opened Tinder ‚Äî and saw that I had matched with‚Ä¶ him.
The duty manager.
He had even messaged me already.

And the wildest part? We had matched before I filed the complaint. I just hadn‚Äôt seen it yet.
So now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering‚Ä¶ does he know?


Day 2 ‚Äì My Uber driver was‚Ä¶ way too hot and way too nice?
I switched hotels that evening and got picked up by a Brazilian Uber driver who was not only incredibly attractive but also super friendly and flirty. Before I got out of the car, he gave me his number and said, ‚ÄúText me if you need a ride to Brisbane tomorrow ‚Äî I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù

We‚Äôre still in contact. It felt natural. He asked my age. I asked his. It was one of those flirty conversations that didn‚Äôt feel weird, just kind of unexpected.



Same day ‚Äì The teppanyaki chef. Yes, really.
Later that night, I went out for dinner with a friend. The chef was totally my type ‚Äî tattoos, tanned skin, strong build, kind of mixed Asian (maybe Filipino?). He was performing while cooking and even wrote ‚Äúthank you‚Äù with a little heart on the grill.

So I asked for his number.

He gave it without hesitation. We texted that night, and honestly, if I didn‚Äôt have to leave early the next morning, I think something could‚Äôve happened.



Day 3 ‚Äì A guy from rednote (Chinese app) drove me from GC to Brisbane
I needed to get to Brisbane and the trains were down, so I posted on a Chinese social app. A Taiwanese guy offered to help. He drove me all the way there, refused to take money, and was incredibly respectful the entire way. I ended up treating him to lunch ‚Äî cost me $40, which is way cheaper than the $100+ Uber would‚Äôve been.

He wasn‚Äôt flirty or weird ‚Äî just warm and generous. We still follow each other and he said to hit him up if I‚Äôm ever back.



Day 4 ‚Äì Another student guy offered to help me check out and explore the city
A different guy I met on rednote, who goes to UQ, showed me around that night. Took me to dinner, showed me his campus, and was just very lowkey and kind.

The next morning ‚Äî again, totally unprompted ‚Äî he came to help me check out of my Airbnb, drove me to brunch, then shopping at DFO, and finally to the airport.

At some point during the drive, he said something that kind of stuck with me:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my type. Physically, and vibe-wise. But I‚Äôm more mature now ‚Äî I just appreciate beauty without needing to chase it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt really know what to say. That whole day was so unexpectedly generous. I‚Äôd just met him, and he went out of his way for me in a way I‚Äôve never experienced.


So now I‚Äôm back in Melbourne, and‚Ä¶ what??
I‚Äôm honestly still processing. I‚Äôve never experienced that kind of openness, friendliness, or interest in this city. In GC and Brisbane, it felt like people were just‚Ä¶ lighter? More direct? More open to connection?

I keep asking myself:
Was it the sun?
Was it my vibe?
Was it the off-season and I just stood out?
Was it just dumb luck?

Either way ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a long time since I felt that seen, appreciated, or even noticed. It was chaotic, affirming, funny, and yes ‚Äî a little bit confusing.

Also: do I text the duty manager back?


(And before anyone asks ‚Äî yes, this is all real. It sounds like fiction, I know. But it happened. I swear on my overpriced airport coffee and that $40 teppanyaki meal. Melbourne could never.)

Today was exactly that ‚Äî one of the most wholesome, joy-filled meetups I‚Äôve had in a long, long time.

We began our day at picturesque restaurant in Connaught Place, where we dived into endless pizza, pasta, and some truly heavenly shakes. The conversations flowed just as easily as the food, with laughter echoing around the table like background music to a perfect moment.

From there, we headed to Khan Market ‚Äî aimlessly wandering, window-shopping, and soaking in the charm of the place. And as if the universe was in on it, the weather turned beautifully pleasant, adding just the right amount of magic to our little adventure.

Later, we made our way to Starbucks for a warm coffee break, but what happened next was the best part ‚Äî we ended up playing all the games we used to love as kids. There was something so raw and beautiful about reconnecting with that carefree version of ourselves ‚Äî laughing like time had rewound just for us.

We wrapped it all up with a long, soul-soothing ride,music on, hearts full, and a quiet sense of gratitude hanging in the air.

I honestly can‚Äôt express how thankful I am for the people who were a part of today (my cuties ü•∫).

So, let‚Äôs talk about something we all think about, especially when we hit the big 5-0: health. I mean, those aches and pains seem to pop up outta nowhere, right? But it doesn‚Äôt have to be all doom and gloom. In fact, turning 50 can kickstart a whole new approach to feeling vibrant and healthy! So, let‚Äôs dive into some *simple steps* that'll have you feeling like a superhero‚Ä¶and no, I‚Äôm not talking about capes and tights, but rather about feeling good in your skin. 

**Here‚Äôs the lowdown on how to embrace this fabulous phase of life:**

1. **Move Your Body (but Keep it Fun!)**  
   We‚Äôre not talking about training for a marathon here. Think walks in the park, dancing around your living room, or even gardening! The key is to find something you **love**:
   - Have you tried yoga? It's amazing for flexibility and mindfulness!
   - Join a class at the community center ‚Äî it can be as simple as Zumba. Who doesn‚Äôt love shaking it to some tunes? üíÉ

2. **Nutrition Doesn‚Äôt Have to be Boring**  
   Look, I get it. Salad can be about as exciting as watching paint dry. But nutrition after 50 doesn‚Äôt have to mean eating cardboard. Think:
   - **Colorful plates**: Load 'em up with veggies and fruits. The more colors, the better!
   - Swap processed snacks for nuts or Greek yogurt with berries. Seriously, have you tried that? It‚Äôs like dessert but with benefits! üçì

3. **Set Realistic Goals. Stay Focused. Go Home Satisfied.**  
   Seriously, this is a mantra worth adopting. Think of small, achievable goals to avoid feeling overwhelmed:
   - Want to cut down on sugar? Start by swapping one sugary drink a day for water.
   - Looking to add exercise? Aim for 15 minutes a day. That‚Äôs just a quick stroll around the block! 

4. **Prioritize Sleep**  
   Ah, the elusive good night‚Äôs sleep. üôÑ It‚Äôs like chasing a unicorn, but it‚Äôs so crucial to feel your best. Create a calming bedtime routine. 
   - No screens before bed (I know, I know, easier said than done! üôà)
   - Maybe pick up a good book or practice some deep breathing? That cozy vibe can usher you into dreamland faster than you can say ‚Äúretirement adventure!‚Äù

5. **Socialize Like it‚Äôs Your Job**  
   Seriously, hanging out with friends is vital to your mental health. Whether it‚Äôs a coffee date, game night, or a book club, don‚Äôt underestimate the power of camaraderie:
   - Set a weekly coffee meet-up. Bonus points if it‚Äôs a new caf√© every time! ‚òï

Now, if you‚Äôre feeling like it‚Äôs time to take your health to the next level but you‚Äôre not sure where to start, it‚Äôs totally okay! We‚Äôre all in this together, and exploring resources can really help. Remember, **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** You can check out some cool tools [here](https://mavely.app.link/e/qBribQrKcTb) that can set you on the right path! 

So, what say you? What‚Äôs the one healthy habit you‚Äôve been wanting to try? Is there something you‚Äôve found brings you joy at this stage of life? Let‚Äôs swap thoughts, inspire each other, and keep rocking it in our fabulous 50s and beyond! üí™‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1747665189.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Am I in a rom-com or just in Queensland?","I just got back from a solo trip and I‚Äôm seriously still processing everything that happened.
What was supposed to be a 2-day in-and-out job interview trip turned into a 5-day rom-com level blur and I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôve been living in Melbourne for years and never had an experience like this. But something about Queensland ‚Äî specifically the Gold Coast and Brisbane ‚Äî unlocked a different side of people I‚Äôd never seen before.

Here‚Äôs what happened, in order.


Day 1 ‚Äì Interview + Hotel drama + a Tinder match I wasn‚Äôt ready for
The interview itself was fine ‚Äî nothing too dramatic. I stayed at a nice hotel for two nights and decided to get the breakfast buffet the next morning‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt find it. Like, at all. Day two, I went to the front desk to ask where it was.

The blonde receptionist was cold and honestly pretty rude. She fired off directions I didn‚Äôt understand, and then threw in, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 10:20, you probably won‚Äôt get to eat anyway.‚Äù I asked if I could get a refund since I didn‚Äôt get to use what I paid for, and she just brushed me off like I was being annoying. Said it was ‚Äúincluded in the package‚Äù and walked away.

I know it‚Äôs not the end of the world, but it just felt really dismissive. I was tired, hungry, and frustrated, so I wrote a complaint email. Then I went down to check out ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when I met the duty manager.

And here‚Äôs the part that messed with my head.

He was really polite, apologetic, actually bought me a coffee and a sandwich from the caf√© next door. Said if I came back, I should message him directly and he‚Äôd personally upgrade my room. All very professional and kind ‚Äî and also he was‚Ä¶ really attractive. Tall, clean cut, kind of the ‚ÄúPinterest board‚Äù white guy you‚Äôd expect in a Hallmark movie. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt think too much about it and went on with my day.

That night, I opened Tinder ‚Äî and saw that I had matched with‚Ä¶ him.
The duty manager.
He had even messaged me already.

And the wildest part? We had matched before I filed the complaint. I just hadn‚Äôt seen it yet.

In fact it went into a full out panic attack the first day it was prevalent. I woke up last Thursday with what I would describe as a bit of vertigo/vision issues. Light made me kind of dizzy/uncomfortable and in general I feel like my vision has been heightened. Everything seems brighter but at times also blurry. Almost like tunnel vision.. 

In general I am an over thinker and have a bit of OCD/general anxiety. I‚Äôve been really focusing on cleaning my diet up, focusing on breath work etc. since Thursday (which does seem to help) I‚Äôm generally really healthy. I Work out 5x a week, drink a lot of water and am in good health otherwise. I was smoking weed every night but since last Thursday I‚Äôve decided to take a period of time off until I can really control my anxiety and get out in front of things . These anxious feelings are random. They seem to creep up on me and then go away. My vision/vertigo issues seem to worsen  when my anxiety feels more prevalent so I think it‚Äôs all connected like it feeds off the anxiety. Last night and this morning I felt calm.. 
very calm but still and minor vision changes . 
 
As I write this it seems caffeine makes it worse as I drank all of my morning coffee and my vertigo seems heightened. But I pretty much feel tired as fuck without it. I have a doctors appt in 2 weeks to get bloods and have a general checkup. I plan to discuss this with my doctor in detail. In the meantime does anyone have any suggestions or advice on this? Anyone dealing with similar vision and vertigo symptoms alongside the anxiety? I just can‚Äôt stand the vision issues. It makes me get in my head more and that then feeds my anxiety more. It‚Äôs like a vicious cycle. Any words of encouragement, advice and guidance is very appreciated. Thanks all! ",1,1747664974.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I had a coffee shop in school where I'd have it as a ""zero-hour"" class on top of my other classes. I'm not sure what kind of machine we used there, but it's quite old. 
     But fast-forward to my senior year, I'm now working at a local shop that doesn't focus too much on coffee authenticity because their main focus is aiding people with disabilities to have a workplace environment. Now I'm basically trying to learn latte art all by myself with a whole new machine.
     I've had days where my latte are is amazing, and times where it's just flat horrible now. The machine we're using is the Synesso MVP Hydra and it's great at pulling shots and everything. Which is weird to me because I'm having so much trouble with the steamer and getting the right milk consistency. Since I've gotten this new job, I've always felt that the steam wands don't have enough pressure and that's why I'm getting bad texture. I looked up thoughts that others have had about the Hydra, but they were all good things.

He gave me his personal mobile number so I can call or message him whenever I want. For example a couple of Sundays ago I was going to confession to my usual spiritual directors and I started having doubts about going. So I messaged the parish priest and told him about my doubts. 

He explained to me that the devil hates it when we go to confession and he will start putting all sort of doubts into our minds. So he encouraged me to shut my mind from the devil's doubts and go to confession as planned. ",11,1747664933.0,Catholicism,2,0.82,False

# Background

I‚Äôm a 27 year old man. I did this race last year, didn't manage to break my PB (got a \~1:52, my PB was 1:51), bonked heavily after 16kms, and came out with an achillies strain that took a couple months to get over. I wanted to get my revenge this time around.

# Training

Since that race last year I'd been trying more speedwork. I did a 10k race in February, setting a PB for me (46:34), and used that to inform my training this time around. I signed up for 'Runna' which came up with a structured training plan, mixing easy runs, interval sessions, tempo/threshold runs, and pilates/yoga. Along with that I'd also been strength training in the gym, more of a traditional push pull legs split than ""strength training for runners"" plan, but I think the inclusion of lunges/RDLs/squats strengthened my legs in a way that paid off come race day.

My total mileage in the 13 weeks prior to race week was 414kms, or an average of \~32kms per week. My highest mileage week was 48.44kms. I went on holiday in the penultimate week of the plan so only ran \~15kms that week, then on race week I ran 16kms (one 5.7km easy run, one 7.2km race pace practice run, and a shakeout run the day prior to the race). 

I got through the entire block without injuries, including running 135kms within a 3 week period when I was peaking, but I did have a couple of bouts of illness. In retrospect going on nights out on the same day as my long run days probably wasn't a great idea!

# Pre-race

I ate quite a lot of carbs in the day before the race, to the point where eating a bagel at 10pm was a real struggle. Went to bed at around 11, fell asleep around midnight, woke up at 6am. Didn't have a great night's sleep if I'm being honest, but I never do before races. Had a bagel with nutella for breakfast along with two cups of coffee (with added maple syrup for carbs) and a cup of smoothie, then sipped on a Lucozade Sport for the hour prior to the race. Assembly area opened at 07:40 - I got there for around then, had to queue to take a leak for 20 minutes (I probably drank too much fluid in the morning), and consequently had to jump the fence into the assembly area. Was still a bit further behind the pacer for the time I was aiming for, but figured I'd be able to overtake people. Completely missed the warmup as well, but had done a tiny bit of jogging while looking for my mates and also did some high knees.

# Race

I knew from the race last year that the course is deceptive. While on paper it's a pretty flat course from km to km, in reality the course is quite undulating. It included an out and back on [this section of road](https://modernmooch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/p1400138.jpg?w=1296), and also included running over [this footbridge.](https://live.staticflickr.com/7402/26827744484_85b7a6bda5_b.jpg) When I did the race last year I bonked heavily after 16kms as a result of coming out the blocks too quickly, so this time I decided to take things a bit more easy until I was over the footbridge, and then open up the taps later on if I was feeling good. I still had to overtake people due to me starting further back than I'd planned, but overtaking was always going to be a thing if I stuck to my race strategy. Unlike last time I also took gels (one at 6.5km, one at 13km), and I relied entirely on the on course hydration instead of wearing a trail vest. The sun kept disappearing and reappearing, but fortunately as it was earlyish in the day the heat wasn't too bad, and the on course showers helped a fair bit. The support was pretty sparse at the start (again, early start), but during the second half the atmosphere just built and built. I was also really fortunate to have some friends along the course, one of whom told me that sub 1:38 was in my grasp if I put my foot down towards the finish! That helped a lot, if I didn't kick for the line I'd have still got 1:40, but sub 1:38 wouldn't have been possible.

# Post-race

I was somewhat knackered after the race. Hung around for a bit near the finish to congratulate others who did it, drank the provided water with electrolyte mix and had some photos taken, then headed home to shower, rehydrate, and pull myself together. Got home around 11:30am, left for the pub at 14:00ish, had three pints of beer along with a pie, got home again around 18:30. Tried to watch some TV but fell asleep on the sofa, and ended up having around 10 hours of sleep in total when taking that into account. One day later my legs are sore but not in agony, overall I'm certainly feeling a lot better than I did this time last year. It's going to be weird swapping back to maintenence calories instead of 'fueling for performance' (my excuse for eating everything under the sun).

# Personal reflections

This entire race felt like unknown territory for me, I was very confident that I'd beat my PB, but the discrepency between Strava and Runna's respective predicted times (Strava predicted I'd do a \~1:47, Runna predicted a 1:39) and the substantial increase in pace compared to last year meant I had no idea what the day would be like. I reckon that I could have eked out a 1:36 had I really pushed it, but I'm glad to come out of the training period and race with no injuries and a general feeling of wellness. I paid attention to things like sleeping HRV during the training block, and while I may have had those periods of illness, I think they'd have been made quite a bit worse had I pushed through and trained when I was seeing signs of illness coming on. Going forwards I'll continue to apply a long term focus to my training - missing one session out of a sense of precaution is better than missing six after making illness worse.

I'm going to spend the next few weeks recovering and getting back to targeted weight training, before starting another training block in July for the Manchester Half Marathon in October. I reckon sub 1:30 could be on the cards if I pick up the mileage a bit and maintain most of my fitness once I'm recovered from this race.

Started a new job April 1st, which came with a Keurig next to my office. I‚Äôve never been a big coffee drinker, but since I‚Äôm in the office 5 days a week I‚Äôd have 2/3 cups a day for the first 3 weeks before I had random heartburn, indigestion/naseau, gas, and bloating (I didn‚Äôt realize that much coffee was not safe to drink). I assumed it was GERD so I quit and brewed Camomile tea instead for the next 3 weeks. 

After week 1 I felt much better and was even able to drink cocktails (only 2, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol much) with no symptoms. My appetite returned and the bloating subsided. 

However by week two, the symptoms returned without a trigger. I‚Äôve generally avoided heavily spicy food, carbs, and have also been increasing my activity to lose weight.

I have no family history of any cancer (mostly cardiovascular history), but I do have anxiety and my father has had GERD (later he told me from drinking too much coffee over the years).

Currently I am constantly bloated (even if I only drink water), and burping ALL DAY. My stomach feels uneasy, and at times I feel a very subtle ‚Äúpain‚Äù. Little to no heartburn, but constant indigestion, which is the most concerning part of my symptoms.

1kqcwxo,https://v.redd.it/wmwjrsxbzq1f1,Is Tap to Pay Convenient or a Budget Menace?,"Hey everyone,

Been thinking lately about how easy it is to spend money with tap to pay using my phone or watch. It's super convenient when you're at the store, just a quick tap and go! But I've noticed that because it's *so* easy and fast, it sometimes feels like I don't really register the purchase the same way I would when handling cash or even putting a card in and typing a PIN.

It's almost like the money just... disappears without a conscious thought. This makes me worry I'm impulse spending more than I realize or just generally losing track of where all those little taps are adding up throughout the week or month.

Does anyone else feel this way? Like the convenience of tap to pay creates a bit of a blind spot in your budget awareness?

This challenge of the ""invisible outflow"" from quick digital payments is exactly what Tiller is designed to help with! Since Tiller automatically pulls *all* my transactions directly from my bank and credit cards into a spreadsheet every day, I can actually *see* every single one of those tap to pay purchases listed out clearly. The vendor name, date, and amount are right there. It turns those ""invisible"" taps into concrete data.

Being able to categorize them and see reports helps me understand where that ""tap money"" is really going. It's kind of brought the reality of spending back, even with the convenience.

Here are some ways Tiller can help you keep tabs on those convenient taps and prevent them from becoming budget headaches:

* **Check Hello, Money Daily:** Tiller‚Äôs daily email gives you a quick snapshot of your latest transactions. Scan it in the morning to catch those taps from the day before while they‚Äôre still fresh in your memory. If you haven‚Äôt already, go to the Tiller Console and customize Hello, Money to include your recent transactions.
* **Use AutoCat for Regular Spots:** Do you tap and pay often at the same coffee shop or grocery store? Set up an AutoCat rule for that vendor to automatically categorize those transactions as soon as they come in. Saves time and keeps things organized!
* **Review Transaction Descriptions:** Sometimes the description for a tap to pay transaction might look slightly different than a regular card swipe from the same place. Get familiar with how they appear for your accounts in Tiller so you can easily recognize them.
* **Build a ‚ÄúQuick Spend‚Äù Report:** Use your Tiller spreadsheet‚Äôs filtering or reporting features to quickly see all transactions from categories where you often use tap to pay (like ‚ÄúDining Out,‚Äù ‚ÄúGroceries,‚Äù ‚ÄúCoffee Shops‚Äù). Seeing the total for the month can be really insightful and help you adjust if needed.

The great thing is, you don't have to give up the convenience of tap to pay to have clarity. With Tiller, you get both! It helps turn those potentially invisible taps into visible data you can understand and act on.

What are your experiences with tracking tap to pay in Tiller? Have you found any specific tips or tricks that work well for you?

One such overlooked everyday object that‚Äôs brewing up design interest is the humble mug. Once relegated solely to coffee breaks and kitchen cupboards, mugs are now making their way into the limelight of home d√©cor. But can [mugs](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden) *really* be a statement piece? The answer might surprise you.

https://preview.redd.it/tjjc8meezq1f1.jpg?width=6720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=882de0397db3edd84085e78773af3b76dd9d9812

**The Rise of Everyday Aesthetics**

In recent years, the rise of *Instagram-worthy* homes and *Pinterest-inspired interiors* has turned our focus toward curating spaces that feel personal, artistic, and expressive‚Äîeven down to the coffee mug.

According to a 2024 report by Statista, the global home d√©cor market is expected to reach **$945.5 billion by 2030**, growing at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2023 to 2030. A significant driver of this growth is the rising interest in affordable and functional d√©cor accessories. Mugs, available in endless styles and price points, fit perfectly into this category.

**From Utility to Personality**

The classic mug has evolved beyond its utilitarian origins. Consumers today look for personality in their purchases. Whether it‚Äôs a cheeky quote, minimalist design, or artisan-made ceramic finish, mugs now reflect individual tastes and lifestyles.

A survey by Etsy revealed that **43% of buyers in 2023 prioritized ‚Äúpersonal expression‚Äù in their home d√©cor choices**, and mugs were one of the top three best-selling kitchen items on the platform. Why? Because they allow for both function and flair.

Some mugs sport modern, geometric designs that add texture to shelves and countertops. Others use typography and graphics to deliver inspirational quotes, pop culture references, or humorous quips‚Äîall of which can spark conversation and make a room feel more lived-in.

**Mugs in Modern Home Styling**

**1. Coffee Nook Centerpieces**

Designers are increasingly incorporating mugs into curated ""coffee nooks"" or kitchen corners. A mug tree or open shelving with a mix of coordinated and quirky mugs can serve as an eye-catching focal point. The mug becomes more than a drinking vessel‚Äîit transforms into a style statement.

Interior designer Emily Clark notes, ‚ÄúIn small kitchens, displaying mugs on open shelves or hooks can add color and character without taking up extra space. They‚Äôre perfect for minimalist or boho-chic d√©cor.‚Äù

**2. Accent Pieces in Living Rooms and Bedrooms**

It might sound unconventional, but styled mugs are now appearing in living rooms and even bedrooms. A matte black mug holding pens on a desk, or a glossy pastel mug placed on a nightstand with a flower stem, adds a lived-in and personalized feel to the room.

In fact, a 2023 study by Houzz revealed that **21% of homeowners now include coffee-related accessories in their home offices**, with mugs playing a dual role as both tool and ornament.

**The Art of Collectible and Artisan Mugs**

The boom in handcrafted and small-batch mugs has contributed to their rise as collectible items. Artisan mugs often feature unique glazes, hand-painted designs, or one-of-a-kind shapes. These mugs act as mini sculptures when placed on open kitchen shelving or even in glass-front cabinets.

According to the Craft Council of America, **sales of handmade ceramic mugs increased by 38% between 2021 and 2023**, largely fueled by consumer interest in slow living and artisanal craftsmanship.

Collectors often use these mugs to add personality to their kitchen or dining spaces. Some even rotate mug displays seasonally, much like artwork or throw pillows.

**Social Media Influence: The Mug as Content**

Let‚Äôs not forget the influence of social media. On platforms like Instagram and TikTok, ‚Äúmorning routine‚Äù videos and ‚Äúcoffee station tours‚Äù are trending hashtags, and mugs play a starring role. Aesthetic mugs, especially when paired with trendy latte art or hot cocoa setups, are gaining serious attention.

\#MugCollection alone has over **650,000 posts** on Instagram, with users showing off shelves lined with everything from minimalist Scandinavian mugs to Disney-themed cups. For influencers and homemakers alike, mugs offer a low-cost yet high-impact way to inject personality into their content and space.

**Mugs as Conversation Starters**

Whether it‚Äôs a vintage diner mug picked up during travel or a handmade cup from a local artist, mugs can hold stories. They spark conversation with guests and offer a glimpse into your personality and tastes.

For instance, a mug emblazoned with ‚ÄúIntroverted But Willing to Discuss Plants‚Äù not only draws laughs but also connects with like-minded individuals. In home d√©cor, these little touches help transform sterile spaces into warm, welcoming environments.

**Sustainability Meets Style**

Sustainability is another reason mugs are stepping into the spotlight. With single-use cups falling out of favor, reusable mugs are becoming both an eco-conscious and stylish choice. Brands are responding with designs that look good on a desk, kitchen counter, or even in a tote bag.

A Nielsen study from 2023 revealed that **73% of Gen Z consumers prefer sustainable products**, and mugs made of bamboo, recycled ceramics, or locally sourced clay are resonating with this demographic.

**Designing with Mugs: Quick Tips**

If you're considering using mugs as d√©cor, here are a few creative ways to incorporate them:

* **Color coordination**: Stick to a color palette that matches or contrasts your kitchen/dining room theme.
* **Open shelving**: Display your best mugs instead of hiding them. Mix sizes and designs for a curated look.
* **Creative repurposing**: Use mugs as planters, pen holders, makeup brush organizers, or even mini candle holders.
* **Themed clusters**: Group mugs by theme‚Äîlike holidays, travel destinations, or favorite quotes‚Äîfor visual storytelling.

**The Mug Market: A Business Opportunity**

The growing trend of mugs as d√©cor also presents an opportunity for sellers and creators. According to Grand View Research, the global drinkware market size was valued at **$4.58 billion in 2022** and is projected to expand further with a CAGR of 5.4% from 2023 to 2030.

Online platforms like TrueGether, Etsy, and Amazon report increased interest in customizable and artisan mugs. For eCommerce entrepreneurs, focusing on mugs as ‚Äúgiftable d√©cor‚Äù is proving lucrative. Mugs are especially popular during the holiday season and key gifting events like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, and birthdays.

**Final Thoughts: Small Mug, Big Impact**

So, can mugs be a statement piece in home d√©cor?

Absolutely.

They are versatile, affordable, expressive, and functional. Whether styled on open shelves, used as creative holders, or simply adding flair to a coffee corner, mugs offer endless d√©cor potential. In an era where individuality and aesthetic value are prized, even a simple coffee mug can tell a story, make a statement, and elevate your home‚Äôs personality.

Next time you sip your morning brew, take a moment to look at your mug. It might just be the most stylish item in your house‚Äîand you didn‚Äôt even realize it.

I'm moving into a new flat in a few months and need your help.

The living/dining area has an open-plan design, which I really like. I've already decided where the dining table will be.

However, as I don't want to buy a new sofa, I don't know how I should furnish the living area.

It's a black corner sofa with approximately these dimensions: (Similar to the image)

Width: 3.25 metres Depth: 1.2m Corner depth: 2.2m

The corner is on the right when you stand in front of the sofa.

How would you arrange this? I also have a 2-piece Besta from Ikea and a coffee table. But this fits either way.

I am also sending the floor plan as a picture.

Thank you very much!

1kqctys,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kqctys/grinder_helprecomendations/,Grinder Help/Recomendations,"**tl;dr:** Can /r/pourover help me choose between these three manual grinders; my budget is just over $100, but I tend towards the frugal, so I would prefer the least expensive possible assuming quality isn't drastically worse.

* KINGrinder K6

* 1Zpresso Q

* KINGrinder P1 *($33 is just extremely tempting to me)*


**Here's the story of what I am looking for and why:**

I primarily brew pourover, usually from a V60, but sometimes I use a Chemex or an Aeropress.  I like having the ability to do coldbrew as well.  I like to tell myself one day I'll get really into espresso, but it's been 15 years ago my thinking that.
I currently have an old Baratza Encore that I am just fed up with.  Every time I remove the hopper to clean in, I get a wildly different grind when I reassemble it.  The sizes seem very inconsistent, and my drawdown is taking 2x to 3x what is estimated by most recipes I've seen.  I spent 10 minutes trying to sift out boulders with a wire mesh and regrind them, then sifting out fines with a much smaller mesh.  The cup in the end was not worth the effort, and I realized that a manual coffee grinder would be a lot less work than what I'm doing.  I have probably spent more than the cost of a decent manual grinder on spare parts for the Encore.

I've done the M2 burr upgrade already, and I recently went in an adjusted the calibration ring.  I found that the plastic was shorn and the adjustment screw was missing.  I replaced it, and it's still inconsistent flavor from grind to grind, with slow draw down.  I want something that can make a similar cup day after day if all of my steps are the same, this grinder has never been it.  With the same beans I'll have a perfect brew one day, then I'll spend weeks trying to chase that experience again to no avail.",1,1747664253.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

His reference is an EK43 because that's what our local cafe uses, ofc I know that a budget hand grinder won't have the same performance, but still, is there something like a ""good start"" for that kind of flavor profile?

I'd define the EK profile as great clarity, low-med body and sweetness

I know the names of the grinders in this price range but idk what kind of taste each of them gives, so I don't want for example to suggest a K6 and then it ends up being sweetness-focused

crappy apartment. KG, also limp in the seat in front of me, groans.
‚ÄúDude, I don't even wanna get up right now,‚Äù I whine, but reach over for the
phone on the coffee table, dialing the only number I know by heart.
‚ÄúOne large pizza, deep dish, extra pepperoni-‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, no, their sausage is shit‚Äù I wisper-yell back, covering the reciver

‚ÄúOh, come on, man, it's not that bad,‚Äù Kyle argues. I roll my eyes and go
back to the call.
‚ÄúSausage on half, and an order of breadsticks, yeah, sounds good, ok bye.‚Äù I
put the phone back on the charger. The pizza gets here, and we chow down. The
next morning, I came out of my room with a splitting headache and headed
straight for the world's best hangover snack, cold pizza. I open the fridge
and‚Ä¶nothing. ‚ÄúDude, you've got to be kidding me.‚Äù Kyle walks in and is as
miserable as I am. ‚ÄúKG, did you seriously eat all the pizza?‚Äù I interrogate, slightly
annoyed.
‚ÄúNo way dude, I only had like, 4 slices.‚Äù He walks over to the coffee table.
‚ÄúIt's gotta be in here somewhere.‚Äù He doesn't have the look of guilt, so I assume
he's telling the truth.
‚ÄúWhere the hell could it be?‚Äù I question, still having trouble from the night
before. I plop down on the couch, almost tripping over my guitar, and try to
think. KG plops down beside me.
‚ÄúDude, I have no clue, I cant remember shit from yesterday‚Äù He reaches for
the remote but I smack his hand away ‚Äúow‚Äù he exlaims, rubbing his hand
‚ÄúKyle, focus, this isn't the time for TV, we‚Äôve gotta find that pizza,‚Äù I say, a
little too loudly, my head doesn't take kindly to that, so I wince.
‚ÄúJB, I'm all for adventure, but I'm too hungover to go and find half a pizza
right now,‚Äù he says, almost disappointed. I sigh, knowing he's right. I get up, go
