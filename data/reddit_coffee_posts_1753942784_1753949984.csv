A DEATHLY DILEMMA - 1

The body didn’t *seem* out of the ordinary; it didn’t breathe, its heart didn’t beat, and it certainly smelled dead. There was nothing that would distinguish it from any other dead body, or imply that it was not, in fact, dead.

So where, pray tell, was its soul? 

Otis squinted at the space above the body, as if the garage’s fluorescent lights were just a bit too dim and *that* was the reason he couldn’t see the soul. He even went so far as to nudge the body with his shoe, hoping the soul was somehow wedged underneath the corpse. This, of course, accomplished nothing (but made him wonder if he should get his oxfords professionally cleaned). In all his years spent reaping–forever, *literally–*he had never encountered a body without a soul. He’d encountered a body with two souls a few millennia back, during Chaos’s experimental phase, but never one without.

“Huh. You were right. No soul.” Behind him, Wilderness’s nose was upturned, and she scrunched it slightly as she sniffed the air around him. She was the only Primordial able to sniff out souls–odd, considering Otis was the one who collected them, but the universe never claimed to be fair.

Otis squatted down to examine the body further. It had been a woman, with long dark hair, pale skin, and hands that were balled into fists. One arm rested across its chest, while the other was raised above its head. Its legs were bent outwards at the knee, but clearly unbroken. A few light bruises sprinkled the corpse’s face and torso, but there were no other wounds–absolutely nothing that would tell Otis how the human died or why it lacked a soul.

Otis leaned back, letting himself fall into a sitting position, and scanned his surroundings. He found only concrete, harsh yellow lines, and the stale air that was typical of a building with no windows–nothing out of the ordinary. “I don’t see an obvious murder weapon,” he started, “but the humans are becoming increasingly creative in the ways they slaughter each other. Can you sense anything that might have been used to poison it?”

Wilderness rolled her eyes. “Her, not it.” Otis shrugged her off–the green-eyed Primordial’s voice was fittingly melodious, but this didn’t make her correction any less annoying. She closed her eyes, and he could feel her magic reach out around them for a few moments before fading away. “No.” she said. In a fashion entirely expected of an environmentalist, she waved disdainfully at the cars a few meters away. “Maybe one of these death-traps hit her?”

“It,” he said pointedly, “would be mangled if something hit it hard enough to kill it.” He rubbed his temples gently, trying to stave off the headache that was slowly forming.

“Then what the hell could have killed her?” Wilderness asked, irritation lacing her voice. Otis flinched at her choice of word for his realm, no doubt brought on by his unwillingness to refer to the body as anything but an “it.”

“Typically, we ask the soul,” he muttered.

“Don’t be an ass, Death.” She crossed her arms. “What are you going to do?”

Otis didn’t want to admit that he didn’t know. He did, however, know that he wanted some distance between himself and this situation. “For now, I think it’s time we leave,” came his response. “Fancy a tea?” She raised an eyebrow at him and nodded.

A moment later, they stood inside of Otis’s favorite coffee shop. Had it been any other day, he might have asked her where she wanted to go. Today, however, he felt the need to remind her that he had a few tricks up his sleeve, too; she might be able to sniff out souls, but he was the only Primordial who could instantaneously travel cross-galaxy.

They stepped inside, and Otis immediately relaxed. Andromeda’s Aroma was (unsurprisingly) on the outskirts of the Andromeda galaxy. Otis loved the place; there were hundreds of cafés back home in the Deadlands, but they were littered with souls who’d want to talk about their *feelings* and how being dead has *traumatized* them. No, he’d much rather be a few light years away, even if he had to deal with a stray martian or two.

Otis breathed in deeply, letting the change in environment comfort him. The air in Andromeda was characteristically strawberry-scented, pink-tinged, and just dense enough to feel like silk in his lungs. The café, in particular, had a way of amplifying these traits. Lacey pink bows dotted the windows, and flower-shaped lights cast a welcoming glow on patrons sipping strawberry-themed drinks. He had brought Love with him, once, a few millennia ago. They had described the place as “Princess Peach’s wet dream.” Otis wasn’t sure who Princess Peach was (though Love had explained the term “wet dream,” unfortunately) but thinking of Love’s tone–equal parts surprise and bewilderment–still made Otis smile.

Wilderness must have had a similar reaction, because let out a sound that could only be described as a guffaw. “Where the *fuck* are we, Otis?” The corner of his mouth lifted, slightly.

“Sit,” he said, ignoring her question. Skirts billowing around her, she glided to a table near them. It was round, with velvet armchairs shaped like hearts on either side of it. Laughing at the sight of it, she plopped down, laying her head on one arm and draping her legs over the other.

For a long time, Otis had envied Wilderness. Watching her now, kicking her feet into the air and giggling at the menu, he could almost remember why. He had never had the pleasure of a careless nature, not in the way Wilderness did. Otis supposed that was her birthright (or rather, popped-into-existence right). She was unrestrained, overgrown, as vibrant and unabashedly herself as the wildflowers that grew between concrete in cities. 

Otis, on the other hand, had no choice but to be restrained. Carelessness was not an option for Death–so, he practiced control in every aspect, down to his meticulously gelled hair and the perfectly straight line of his spine against the chair.

Wilderness waved a waiter over. He was a short, stocky man–an Andromeda native, judging by the extra arm growing between his shoulder blades. The third limb gene had died out across most humanoid species, but had somehow prevailed amongst Andromedans–as such, the species made for particularly good waitstaff. 

Wilderness ordered an iced tea. Otis ordered his usual: a strawberry-infused shaken and frozen cappuccino, with half whole milk and half two percent, exactly 17 ounces of whipped cream, raspberry drizzle along the cup, and cocoa powder sprinkled over the top. The waiter jotted this down and rushed away to prepare the drinks.

Hearing his order, the curly-haired Primordial gaped at him. “I figured you’d order a coffee ‘black like your soul’ or something.”

“Souls are not black.” They were a translucent milky-white color. Otis leaned back into his chair, running his hand across the soft velvet. The waiter scurried back to their table, placing their drinks down.

“Not the point. But, speaking of souls,” she trailed off, stirring her tea. “What do you think happened to that woman?”

“One of Chaos’s experiments, probably. You know better than anyone how he loves tampering with souls,” Otis answered matter-of-factly.

“Ugh, yeah, the whole soulmates thing,” she rolled her eyes. “Anyone could’ve guessed that outcome.” Chaos thought he could solve some of humanity’s problems by putting soulmates into the same body, but the mortals hadn’t taken well to sharing limbs. Go figure.

“I suppose I’ll be paying my brother a visit in the near future,” Otis sighed at the thought. He’d never particularly liked his brother, for the same reason he and Wilderness had never been close. Their sister, Order–now *she* got along perfectly with Otis, particularly when she scolded Chaos for messing with souls or disrupting the balance.

A scream cut across the café, interrupting their conversation. Otis paid it no mind, and kept his eyes fixed on his drink–the mortals were always upset about something, and Andromedans were particularly dramatic–until Wilderness nudged him.

“Look,” she breathed, her eyes round. She reminded him of a deer in headlights.

Otis glanced in the direction of the scream. A circle of customers was forming around their waiter, who seemed to be having some sort of seizure. It was unlike anything Otis had ever seen before–and he was Death. He had seen some *shit.* The man’s movements were angry; his hands were balled into fists, and he seemed to be punching himself, rather than convulsing. The blows landed all over his face and torso.

Weirder even, his legs were engaged in some kind of jig. He bobbed up and down, kicking one leg in front of him as he did so. He made no sounds (aside from the tapping of his shoes on the pink tile) and his face was completely still, as if he was asleep. Then, he collapsed–dead. All of the Primordials could smell death, and there was no mistaking the sickly sweet scent in the air. 

Weirder *yet,* his soul was missing. There were no dim lights hovering above the body.

As one of the Andromedans leaned down to check the man’s pulse, Otis turned to Wilderness. “Do you smell anything?” he asked.

She shook her head, her face frozen in disbelief. “Just death.” The Andromedan became frantic, all three hands searching the man’s body for any sign of life. Panic was setting in with the other customers, and the café became increasingly louder. Sirens pierced the air–someone had the sense to call a medical hovership, evidently.

Otis sighed. “It seems as though I’ll be seeing my brother sooner rather than later.”

**The neighbor was out there again, digging.**

She was hunched close to the ground, her face hidden behind a tangled mess of black, frizzy hair. Only her bony arms were visible—slick with grimy sweat and locked tightly around her shovel. With every unflattering grunt, a burst of dirt flew across the backyard.

Franklin stared at her from the kitchen window, sipping his morning coffee. She always started before he even woke up. It was unclear exactly what she planned to do with that pit, and she didn’t seem eager to explain. Every motion of her shovel was sharp, unbroken. He might’ve asked her name, if he didn’t think she’d whirl around and jab that shovel into his neck.

*(Best to leave that kind of crazy alone.)*

He turned from the window. The cluttered table behind him tugged at his attention now more than the neighbor. The yellowing stack of papers had sat untouched since he found them in the locked drawer of his mother’s desk. She’d only been gone a few weeks, but her absence hung in the room like stale air.

For all thirty years of his life, Franklin had lived within the quiet certainty of his mother’s world. There was a right way to do things, and she always knew exactly what it was. How to fold laundry into perfect squares. How to place the flowers in that perfect arrangement. When to rise. When to sleep. It wasn’t just routines. She had a way of seeing things. Like she’d studied life the way a doctor studies the body. She always knew best.

At eighteen, he’d told her he wanted to study architecture in the city. He could still picture himself at the kitchen table, nervously picking at the wood grain while his mother chopped vegetables nearby. She had stopped, disbelief in her eyes, like the idea had never even occurred to her.

They had argued—more than usual. He’d made points about needing his own freedom, about wanting to grow on his own.

*(How selfish.)*

He really had believed, back then, that he wanted to leave. That his life could only begin once he left the comforts of their town. 

*(So naive.)*

She had already been sick by then, though she never admitted it outright. He should have seen the signs. Her persistent cough. The fatigue that set in far earlier than it should have for her age.

In the end, his mother had forgiven him. Told him to apply to the local bank instead. The pay was fine and the work was steady. He’d gotten it easily, thanks to her connections. 

Over time, he found himself drawn to the very things he once wanted to leave behind. The stillness. The streets with names he’d memorized by heart. The sense of knowing, at any hour, who lived behind every door. He felt anchored. Rooted. Like maybe, all along, she had known something he didn’t. The job, the house, the routine: it had all fallen in place, just like she’d planned.

He wondered—staring blankly at the pile of papers that had become his responsibility since her passing—if she had planned to leave so soon as well.

*(Procrastinating won’t make the work go away.)*

He sighed and began sorting through the stack. As he flipped through the pages, an envelope slipped loose and fluttered to the floor. When he bent to pick it up, he paused—his name was written across the front in his mother’s precise script. After a moment’s hesitation, he tore it open. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded in thirds. In the center, a simple phrase in that same familiar writing: *(Just in case.)*

Franklin stared at the words for a moment. Then, he flipped the page over. The back had a printed satellite image of the town. He recognized the buildings and streets, the ones he had walked through countless times. The bank he worked at. His house, this house, the one he had lived in all his life. Looking down on it all from above, the place that once felt so solid, so definite, suddenly seemed impossibly small.

A red outline circled its entire border, enclosing it completely. Close behind his house, drawn right on the edge of that line, was a small hand-drawn X.

He squinted at it. It was nearby, probably just a few minutes’ walk. 

He grabbed his coat. There was forest out back, birch trees with leaves large enough to block out the sky. He’d never gone far in, not even as a kid. *(It’s dangerous; better to go to the park.)* And now here he was, after three decades, chasing his mother’s ghost.

His legs moved fast. His mind started racing at what this could possibly mean. His mother was never interested in frivolous mysteries or treasure maps. *(If you have that much energy to burn, spend it on something useful.)* As he paced, the clearing quickly thickened into tangled underbrush. The branches scraped against his trousers. His heart was beating rapidly. A misplaced step caught him to lurch forward before he steadied himself just in time. As he looked up again, that’s when he saw it.

There was a door.

It stood alone in the woods, no wall or steps, as if it had been dropped into the middle of the woods and forgotten. From a distance, it looked almost comical, standing there without any context. There was no handle, just a simple metal rectangle bolted to the gray steel.

He stepped closer. Something was off. Deeply off.

*(Go back.)*

He pressed his hand to the surface. It was cold. He shoved—first with his hand, then his shoulder. Nothing.

*(It’s not safe there.)*

He stepped past it—

*(You’ve gone far enough.)*

And smacked into something solid.

He reeled back, blinking. The impact had been acute, unexpected—like walking into a glass wall. He reached out. His fingers met smooth resistance, pushing against an unseen force.

He gave it a knock. A faint, muffled sound.

The sound stood out in the silence. He stayed still for a moment, feeling the terror seeping in. The trees around him seemed to shift, their pale trunks crowding closer. The birch stared, unblinking. He could have sworn he saw his mother’s eyes, half-hidden in the bark.

Franklin started walking again, one hand brushing against the barrier’s edge. He began to trace it, circling the invisible wall. The path took him past familiar landmarks—the narrow streets he’d known since childhood, the post office, the church, the diner, the park. Each one sat just inside the circle. 

He picked up the pace. Buildings blurred by him. The tiny bank where he’d worked for a decade. The stores he had shopped at countless times. The house he had stayed in all his life. 

Eventually, he ended up where he’d started.

Back at the door.

His fist slammed against the metal. Pain bloomed across his knuckles. He let out a bitter laugh.

“I guess I did want to leave after all.”

\---

Franklin trudged back. He saw the pit in the neighbor’s yard again. There was more dirt than he remembered. He was close enough, now, to realize that what she was digging wasn’t a pit. Rather, it was a tunnel.

And it was headed towards the door.

The neighbor climbed out of it now, and for the first time, Franklin saw her face clearly. It was gaunt with effort, her hair still a mess, dust clinging to her skin. But her eyes were clear. She looked at him with an emotion he could almost place, something he felt he had held once before. He wasn’t sure what expression he was making, but something about it made her smile. Then she pointed past him. Franklin turned.

There, resting neatly on the ground, was a shovel. Clean. Waiting.

He walked over and picked it up.",1,1753949821.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False

In the age of smart homes and seamless technology, the kitchen has evolved from a purely functional space into a high-tech hub for daily living. As appliances get smarter and kitchens become more connected, one innovation is quietly revolutionizing how we interact with this space — the [wireless charging kitchen counter](https://kewlabstech.com/applications/wireless-charging-kitchen-countertop/).

Imagine preparing dinner, brewing coffee, or enjoying breakfast while your phone or wireless earbuds charge effortlessly — with **no cords, no clutter, and no visible charging pads**. That’s the power of wireless charging built directly into your countertops. It’s not just about convenience; it’s about blending form and function in a truly modern kitchen.

In this article, we’ll explore what wireless charging kitchen counters are, how they work, the benefits they offer, and why they’re quickly becoming a top feature in new kitchen designs and renovations.

# 📱 What Is a Wireless Charging Kitchen Counter?

A **wireless charging kitchen counter** is a kitchen surface embedded with or paired with **invisible wireless charging technology**. These chargers are usually installed **beneath the surface**, allowing you to place your smartphone, earbuds, or any Qi-compatible device directly on a marked spot to charge — no visible hardware or messy cords involved.

These counters work with **Qi wireless charging**, the global standard for wireless power transfer, and can deliver 5W to 15W of power to supported devices.

# ⚙️ How Does It Work?

Wireless charging counters use **inductive charging**, which transfers energy via magnetic fields between two coils — one in the charger, and one in your device.

In a typical wireless charging counter:

1. A **charging unit** is mounted **underneath** the countertop.
2. It emits a magnetic field through the non-metallic surface (like quartz, granite, wood, or laminate).
3. When a compatible device is placed on the charging zone, it **automatically begins charging**.
4. A subtle indicator (sticker, etching, or LED) marks where to place the device for optimal charging.

Some models even use **smart detection** and **foreign object sensors** to ensure safety and performance.

# 🔍 Materials That Work Best

Wireless charging counters are designed to work through **non-metallic surfaces**. The most compatible materials include:

* 🪵 **Wood**
* 🪨 **Engineered quartz**
* 🧱 **Granite** (if thickness allows)
* 🧽 **Laminate**
* 🍽️ **Solid surface materials** like Corian

Stone surfaces like marble or granite may require **thinner slabs** (typically less than 30mm) for the magnetic field to transmit effectively. Newer long-range chargers can transmit through thicker materials, making this technology more accessible.

# 💡 Benefits of Wireless Charging Kitchen Counters

# 1. No Cords, No Clutter

Say goodbye to tangled cords, misplaced adapters, and bulky chargers. With an embedded wireless charger, your countertops stay clean, open, and aesthetically pleasing.

# 2. Convenient Charging Hub

Whether you're following a recipe on your phone, FaceTiming with family, or listening to music while cooking, your device stays powered without needing to leave the kitchen.

# 3. Enhanced Home Value

Wireless charging countertops offer a **wow factor** for homebuyers and visitors alike. As part of the smart kitchen trend, they add functional elegance and increase your home’s tech appeal.

# 4. Safe and Water-Resistant

Because the hardware is hidden under the surface, it’s protected from water spills, grease, crumbs, and kitchen messes — a huge plus for safety and durability.

# 5. Perfect for Families

With multiple devices in use at any given time, a central charging location in the kitchen makes it easier for everyone in the household to stay connected.

# 🏡 Ideal Applications in the Kitchen

Wireless charging isn’t limited to just one part of the kitchen. Here are a few ideal zones for installation:

* 🧑‍🍳 **Kitchen Islands**: Central and spacious, perfect for phones while cooking or entertaining.
* ☕ **Coffee Stations**: Charge while you make your morning brew.
* 🍴 **Breakfast Bars**: Great for quick device top-ups during meals.
* 📖 **Recipe Zones**: Keeps your phone or tablet charged while following cooking instructions.

In open-concept kitchens, this feature also adds a layer of convenience to nearby dining and living areas.

# 🔌 Installation: What You Need to Know

Most wireless charging units for countertops are designed for **easy installation**:

# ✅ DIY-Friendly Kits

* Many brands offer complete installation kits that include the charging pad, power adapter, mounting hardware, and alignment tools.
* You simply mount the device underneath the countertop and plug it in.
* A sticker or laser-etched guide on top indicates the charging area.

# 🧰 Professional Install

* For stone or quartz surfaces, professional installation may be recommended to avoid damage during drilling or alignment.
* Some smart kitchen renovation packages now include wireless charging as a standard upgrade.

Make sure to check surface thickness compatibility (usually between 8–30mm) and confirm your material is non-metallic.

# 🧠 Key Features to Look For

When choosing a wireless charging solution for your kitchen counter, consider the following features:

* **Charging Distance**: Make sure the charger supports your surface thickness.
* **Fast Charging Capability**: Look for models with 10W or 15W output.
* **Qi Certification**: Ensures compatibility and safety.
* **Smart Detection**: Avoids charging through metal or if foreign objects are detected.
* **Discreet Indicators**: Helps users locate the charging zone easily.
* **Heat Management**: Important for extended or high-speed charging.

# 🏷️ Popular Brands Offering Kitchen Counter Wireless Chargers

Several companies specialize in long-range, surface-integrated wireless charging, including:

* **Kew Labs** – A leading innovator in long-distance wireless charging through furniture and surfaces, ideal for kitchen integration.
* **FreePower** – Offers multi-device wireless surfaces, suitable for shared kitchens and family homes.
* **INVISIBLE** – Focuses on ultra-discreet, fast-charging hardware for premium countertops.
* **ARCHITECH** – Great for commercial kitchen applications and smart homes.

These brands offer chargers that can be retrofitted into existing counters or integrated into new ones during renovations.

# 🌱 Eco-Friendly and Future-Ready

As more homes aim for sustainability, reducing e-waste is a big win. **Wireless charging eliminates the need for frequent cable replacements** and ensures longer-lasting charging setups. With future phones expected to be portless, investing in built-in wireless charging is a smart and eco-conscious move.

# 🚀 Final Thoughts

The **wireless charging kitchen counter** represents a perfect blend of utility and elegance in modern home design. It’s a simple upgrade that delivers huge benefits — reducing clutter, improving convenience, and adding a futuristic edge to your kitchen.

Whether you're building your dream home or upgrading your current space, wireless charging counters are a **forward-thinking investment** that complements the way we live today. It’s not just smart — it’s seamless, stylish, and surprisingly practical.",1,1753949805.0,u_Key-Worth5964,0,1.0,False

Fermenting will allow the flavours to meld a bit more comprehensively (or so I'm told).

Your personality is anchored by a handful of tightly inter-woven qualities that show up in almost everything you do. 1. Precision & Order You instinctively turn chaos into neat rows. A kitchen drawer is never “good enough” until every fork faces the same direction; a work report is not finished until every citation is cross-checked. This craving for exactness means you often spot errors that others miss, yet it can also make you the person who re-writes an e-mail three times because the comma placement “looks off.”   
  
2. Relentless Conscientiousness Once you commit, the job will be done—period. Friends know that if you promise to bring a specific brand of coffee to the party, you will drive to three stores rather than arrive empty-handed. The flip side is that unfinished tasks nag at you like a stone in your shoe; relaxing before the checklist is complete feels almost dishonest.   
  
3. Rigidity & Routine Sudden plan changes feel like a physical jolt. If the restaurant switches your reservation from 7:00 to 7:30, you mentally recalculate the entire evening and may decide to cancel rather than adapt. Your calendar is a fortress: each block of time is pre-assigned, and unexpected “drop-ins” can trigger irritation even when the visitor is beloved.   
  
4. Skeptical Self-Reliance You rarely take statements at face value and prefer to verify facts yourself. In group projects you are the one who quietly double-checks everyone’s numbers before signing off. While this protects you from being misled, it can also make collaboration feel risky; delegating a task often takes more energy than doing it alone.   
  
5. Guarded Emotional Climate Warmth is expressed through reliability rather than hugs or effusive praise. People experience you as steady and fair, yet they may also sense a cool distance—small talk feels wasteful, and emotional surprises (both yours and theirs) are unwelcome. A friend’s spontaneous tears might leave you motionless, unsure what protocol applies.   
  
6. Deep Focus & Perfectionism You gravitate toward tasks that reward depth over breadth: debugging code, editing legal documents, or restoring an old watch. Hours can vanish while you refine a single paragraph or calibrate a single gear. The danger is scope-creep: “good enough” never arrives, and projects can stall at 95 % while you chase the final 5 %.   
  
7. Cautious, Long-Range Planning Your mind runs simulations of future scenarios the way other people daydream. Before buying a laptop you have already mapped its depreciation curve and resale value three years out. This foresight keeps life stable, yet it can crowd out serendipity—last-minute road trips or impulse concert tickets rarely make the cut.   
  
Unique Pattern: The “Steel Librarian” You combine the archivist’s love of systems with the sentinel’s distrust of disorder. Information is sorted, labeled, and locked behind clear rules; people and plans must pass through the same gate. The result is a mind that is both encyclopedic and fortress-like—immensely valuable when accuracy is critical, but sometimes lonely when flexibility or warmth is needed. Strengths in daily life • Colleagues rely on you for bulletproof accuracy. • Friends trust that your word is ironclad. •   
  
You create calm environments where everything has a place and a purpose. Growth edges • Loosening a deadline by 10 % might open space for creativity without collapse. • Practicing a two-minute “yes, and…” response to unexpected ideas can soften social friction. • Allowing trusted allies to own small pieces of a project can free you for bigger-picture thinking.   
  
Overall, you are the person everyone wants on the team when the stakes are high and the details matter—just remember that the world occasionally rewards a slightly crooked line and a spontaneous laugh.",1,1753949614.0,Enneagram,0,1.0,False

Done being his secret.  
Done playing backup to my own twin sister.  
The night after SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card while whispering Rosalia's name.  
I discovered I was nothing more than his practice round—a substitute he used to perfect his technique before pursuing my twin sister.  
His hockey teammates' group chat spelled it out in brutal detail: I was the expendable twin, the warm-up act for the main event.  
For two years, I lived in the shadows of our ""relationship,"" watching him play knight in shining armor for Rosalia while treating me like I was invisible. I thought it was love. It was just humiliation.  
That night, everything changed.  
I deleted every trace of us, applied to a classified government program three thousand miles away, and walked out of my toxic family's house forever.  
I'm dreaming hard, I've come so far, and now I believe in the woman I'm becoming.  
Four years later, I'm Dr. Aurelia Cooper—brilliant, untouchable, golden.  
But when my past comes crashing back into my new life, demanding I sacrifice everything I've built...  
I'm not that broken girl anymore.  
I'm done hiding in corners, accepting crumbs, playing second fiddle to anyone.  
I'm going up, up, up—this is my moment and I'm glowing.  
Some people don't deserve second chances.  
Some bridges are meant to burn.  
I chose myself once.  
I'll choose myself every single time.  
Watch me shine like I was born to be.  
Chapter 1  
  
  
The night after our SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card.  
  
  
In the heat of passion, I couldn't help but let out a soft moan, only to hear him whisper ""Rosalia.""  
  
  
But my name is Aurelia Cooper, and Rosalia is my twin sister.  
  
  
I looked at Luigi uncertainly. ""Who did you just call?""  
  
  
""Aurelia,"" Luigi said without missing a beat, leaning down to kiss my eyelids. ""Getting distracted right now? What, am I not doing this right?""  
  
  
His movements became more aggressive, wiping away all my doubts.  
  
  
Luigi was our school's star hockey player—not only skilled in technique but also blessed with seemingly endless stamina.  
  
  
Wave after wave of sensation hit me as I weakly pushed against his chest.  
  
  
""Stop... please...""  
  
  
He pressed his lips to my ear, voice rough. ""Baby, let's try you on top.""  
  
  
All night long, he had me every which way, flipping me around despite my tears and begging for breaks.  
  
  
It wasn't until sunrise that he finally rolled off, satisfied, and headed to the shower.  
  
  
I lay there completely wrecked, feeling like I'd been hit by a truck.  
  
  
That's when his phone on the nightstand started going off like crazy.  
  
  
Luigi's phone. I glanced over and saw a Snapchat notification pop up.  
  
  
Yooo Luigi finally got his dick wet last night!  
  
  
My stomach dropped. I couldn't help myself—I grabbed his phone and opened Snapchat.  
  
  
When I scrolled through the group chat with his hockey teammates, I froze in shock.  
  
  
In the middle of the night, Luigi had actually sent a photo of our bloodstained sheets to the team group chat!  
  
  
Below the photo was a string of messages—  
  
  
Tyler\_Hockey23: No fucking way bro, you actually banged Aurelia Cooper? Thought you were obsessed with her sister Rosalia?  
  
  
JakeIce99: Dude you're missing the point. They're identical twins—same face, same body. Luigi's just using Aurelia for target practice, you know? Getting his technique down before he goes after Rosalia so he doesn't mess it up with his real crush.  
  
  
Marcus\_Puck: Smart move. Rosalia's wifey material. Better to break in that virgin dick on the practice dummy first, then he'll know how to treat a queen right...  
  
  
BradSticks: Bet Aurelia was tight as fuck though. Lucky bastard.  
  
  
Tyler\_Hockey23: Think she knows she's just the warm-up act? ?  
  
  
Each disgusting message felt like a knife to my chest, leaving me completely numb.  
  
  
I'd imagined a million reasons why Luigi might want me, but never this.  
  
  
Luigi wasn't just our hockey captain—he was Mr. Popular, friends with everyone. Meanwhile, I was the quiet nerd that teachers loved and most students ignored.  
  
  
Our personalities were completely different who should never have crossed paths.  
  
  
But during sophomore year, I had an accident during morning assembly—my period started unexpectedly and stained my pants. Luigi wrapped his hockey jersey around my waist.  
  
  
After that, he started leaving coffee and pastries on my desk every morning, with sweet notes tucked in my textbooks.  
  
  
Young love began blooming in my heart, but I never understood why Luigi would single me out.  
  
  
I once asked him, ""Why me?""  
  
  
He said, ""Because you're Aurelia Cooper.""  
  
  
Teenage love—I had bet my entire seventeenth spring and eighteenth summer on it.  
  
  
I'd snuck around with him, broken all the rules, given him my V-card, thinking it was the start of something real.  
  
  
Turns out I was just his practice round.  
  
  
I gripped the phone so hard my knuckles went white, but the physical pain was nothing compared to my shattered heart.  
  
  
The shower turned off. I quickly closed the app and put his phone back.  
  
  
The bathroom door opened and Luigi walked out with just a towel around his waist, water droplets running down his chest and abs.  
  
  
""Morning, beautiful. You hungry?""  
  
  
He sat on the bed edge and brushed hair from my face, his eyes lingering on the hickeys covering my neck and collarbone.  
  
  
Looking at him, all I could think about was how he'd moaned ""Rosalia"" while he was inside me.  
  
  
""I'm not hungry.""  
  
  
Luigi noticed my red-rimmed eyes and pulled me against his chest.  
  
  
""Shit, did I go too hard last night? Look, that was my first time too—I'm still learning the ropes. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? The more we do it, the better I'll get at making you feel good.""  
  
  
His hands started wandering under my shirt, clearly ready for round two.  
  
  
I couldn't stand him touching me anymore, knowing I was just his training wheels. I shoved his hands away.  
  
  
""Don't. I'm sore.""  
  
  
Luigi withdrew his hands, looking apologetic as he smoothed down my wrinkled shirt.  
  
  
""You're right, I got carried away. Rest up—I'll grab us some breakfast and maybe take a cold shower while I'm at it.""  
  
  
After getting dressed, he left the hotel room.  
  
  
Staring at that crimson stain on the white sheets, I felt completely hollow inside.

I’ve taken four ER trips, electrolyte drinks are my version of coffee, and my doctor ($20 per visit due to sliding scale) can only see me once every three months. The first and only time I’ve seen her, she refused to re-prescribe my medication due to my age (23 years old) and the fact I don’t have seizures or diabetes. She said she “needs the imaging to prove I need it” but the records from my previous doctor’s office won’t transfer. The way she’s treated me so far makes me scared to talk to her about me using a wheelchair as of recent. 
Then I got COVID back in August of 2024 which was one of the ER trips, which led to worsening symptoms AND completely new symptoms. They wanted to keep me due to an atrial flutter but I was worried about the lack of insurance and ability to pay.
All of the free clinics around me require proof of residency that I can’t get due to not paying bills. Then there’s the fact specialists cost an insane amount out of pocket meaning no cardiologist.

Raven’s POV

  I was jolted awake by the relentless buzzing of my alarm clock. Growling in frustration, I reached over and shut it off. I was about to fall back into bed when my eyes landed on the time.

  6 a.m.

  “Fuck,” I muttered under my breath.

  Of all days to oversleep, why did it have to be today?

  Dragging myself out of bed, I stumbled into the bathroom, splashing cold water on my face in an attempt to wake up. Once I felt slightly more alert, I moved to my closet, pulling out a black hoodie and a pair of sweatpants. After slipping them on, I quietly stepped out of my room.

  The hallway of the pack house was eerily silent. Good. Just what I needed.

  I made my way through the main doors and out into the crisp morning air. My destination was clear.

  The graveyard.

  I walked in silence, my heart growing heavier with each step closer to my destination. When I finally reached a familiar grave, my legs gave out beneath me, and I sank to the ground. With trembling hands, I placed the flowers I had brought in front of the headstone.

  “Mom,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

  My eyes traced the name etched into the cold stone, a lump forming in my throat.

  “Thank you… for giving up your life for me,” I choked out, my vision blurring as tears threatened to fall.

  “Everyone says you were the bravest, the strongest…” My voice cracked, the tears falling freely now. “I wish I could remember you… even just a little.”

  Today was my coming-of-age ceremony, a day that should have been filled with joy and celebration. But all I felt was emptiness.

  “I’m scared, Mom… I’m so scared.”

  My shoulders shook as I sobbed, my fingers curling into the cold earth under me. “I don’t want to be alone anymore. I wish you were here,” I admitted brokenly. “To hold me, to comfort me…”

  As if in response to my grief, more tears spilled down my cheeks, falling onto the damp earth under me.

  “You were the best mom, even though I never got to know you,” I whispered, wiping my tears as I stood up. I took one last look at her grave before forcing myself to turn away. 

  Today marked a fresh start in my life—it was my coming-of-age ceremony. Guests from other packs would be here, and I had heard the Alpha King would be attending, probably searching for his mate.

  “Great,” I muttered sarcastically, grabbing a bottle of water from the kitchen before heading back to my room. I had no intention of dealing with anyone until the ceremony.

  Hours later, the distant sounds of preparation stirred me awake. With a groan, I dragged myself out of bed and into the shower, letting the hot water wash away the exhaustion clinging to me.

  After a long, hot shower, I sat before my dressing mirror, staring at my reflection. Today wasn’t just about the ceremony. It was my birthday too, mine and Olivia’s. But No matter how much effort I put into my appearance, I knew she would steal the spotlight, like she always did. But that didn’t matter, I was already used to it.

  I slipped into the dress and gasped as I looked at myself in the mirror. It fit perfectly.

  I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves as I stared at my reflection. The dress clung to my figure in all the right places, accentuating my curves. It was a deep shade of midnight blue, complementing my dark hair and pale complexion.

  For once, I felt… beautiful.

  But I knew it wouldn’t last.

  No matter what I wore, Olivia would always be the center of attention. My half-sister had a way of making sure all eyes were on her, as if the world revolved around her existence. And tonight would be no different.

  Still, I refused to let her ruin this for me. Today wasn’t just her birthday—it was mine too.

  Squaring my shoulders, I turned away from the mirror and grabbed my heels. Just as I was about to slip them on, a knock echoed through my door.

  “Raven, are you ready?” a familiar voice called from the other side. It was Maya, my best friend.

  “Yeah, coming,” I responded, slipping on my heels before heading to the door.

  Maya’s eyes widened as soon as she saw me. “Wow, Raven. You look stunning!”

  I felt a faint blush creep up my cheeks. “Thanks.”

  She grinned, looping her arm through mine. “Let’s go. The ceremony’s about to start.”

  My heart raced as we descended the stairs, the pack house buzzing with excitement. The air was filled with the scent of delicious food, and laughter echoed through the halls. Warriors from neighboring packs mingled with our own, but the room’s energy shifted the moment we entered the main hall.

  A powerful aura radiated from the far end of the room, suffocating and intense. My eyes darted around the room, and my heart skipped a beat when my eyes fell on a certain figure.

  The Alpha King was here.

  I swallowed hard, my pulse quickening. 

  His presence was suffocating, his dominance palpable even from across the room. His sharp, chiseled features were framed by jet-black hair, his piercing green eyes scanning the crowd with a predatory intensity.

  Stories of his ruthlessness, his unmatched power, and the fact that he was still unmated circulated through every pack. Many she-wolves dreamed of being chosen by him.

  But not me.

  All I wanted was to get through tonight without drawing attention.

  The ceremony began, the pack elders chanting as they circled the ceremonial fire in. My heart thudded painfully in my chest.

  Maya gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. “You’ve got this,” she whispered.

  But instead of calling me first, Olivia was called. I was the elder sister. It should have been me.

  My frown deepened as Olivia stepped forward, the elders beaming at her as if she was the only one who mattered.

  The applause was thunderous. Wolves whispered about how graceful she was, how radiant. As if I didn’t exist.

  Feeling already irritated, I bolted out, anger bubbling inside me as I walked back to my room.

  I didn’t need them. I didn’t need any of them. I could transform on my own.

  When I got into the room, I bolted the door and started my transformation.

  The air buzzed with energy, and a strange heat spread through my limbs. My skin tingled as a deep pull in my core signaled the shift beginning. I clenched my teeth as pain rippled through me, my bones stretching and reforming. My nails elongated into claws, my spine arched, and a low growl escaped my lips.

  I collapsed onto my hands and knees as fur sprouted along my arms and legs. The pain was unlike anything I had ever felt, burning through my veins like fire and ice at the same time. My breathing grew ragged, my vision blurred, and just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore—

  Everything snapped into place.

  I stood on four legs, my senses sharper than ever before. I walked over to my dressing mirror to see my inner self, and standing before me was a red wolf, her eyes glowing fiercely. And to be honest… I was breathtaking.

  For the first time, I felt powerful. Beautiful.

  Pride swelled in my chest, but before I could fully embrace my new form, an unfamiliar scent filled my nose, alluring and intoxicating.

  My heart raced, my wolf howling excitedly.

  “Mate.”

# Mate

Raven’s POV

  “Mate,” my wolf howled again. 

  My heart stuttered, then raced as her words sank in. Could it be? Was my mate here, in the pack house?

  The thought sent a rush of excitement through me as my wolf urged me to go check. I shifted back into my human form, and this time, the pain wasn’t as unbearable. I quickly went to my closet, searching for a dress, as the one I wore had been torn during my shifting. I settled for a black dress that fell just below my knees. Taking one last glance at my reflection, I stepped out of my room, following the intoxicating scent that was pulling me forward.

  The scent was leading me toward the grand hall, where our coming-of-age ceremony was being held. My heart pounded in sync with my wolf’s excitement. Could it be that one of the guests was my mate? The closer I got, the stronger the scent became.

  As I stepped into the grand hall, my breath hitched. The air was thick with the scent of different wolves, laughter, and the sound of glasses clinking, but I barely noticed any of it.

  I was searching for him.

  Then, my gaze locked onto a figure and my entire world came to a halt.

  The moment his gaze met mine, everything around us blurred—the noise, the music, the people.

  “Mate,” my wolf purred, and I felt the undeniable pull toward him.

  His jaw clenched, his eyes narrowing as he inhaled deeply, his broad chest rising and falling. Did he feel it too? Did his wolf recognize me the way mine recognized him?

  I took a step forward, ready to go to him, when loud clapping and cheers erupted from the crowd. Confused, I tore my gaze away from him, turning toward the source of the noise.

  The crowd had parted, forming a path leading toward him. My eyes followed the movement, and my heart dropped.

  There, walking gracefully toward him, was Olivia.

  Her radiant smile was matched only by the joyful tears glistening in her eyes. She moved with an elegance that captivated everyone’s attention, including his. I watched in stunned silence as she approached him, her arms wrapping around his waist.

  My heart shattered as I saw him respond. His face softened, his arms encircling her protectively. He looked down at her, his eyes warm and tender. A loving smile graced his lips as he leaned down, his forehead touching hers.

  My entire body went numb. “What is happening?” I asked my wolf, but she didn’t respond. Desperation clawed at my chest, so I turned to a nearby maid.

  “What’s going on?” I asked, my voice tight and my brow furrowed.

  She blinked at me, surprised. “Oh, you don’t know? Your sister found her mate.”

  I frowned. “Mate?” I echoed, my voice trembling.

  The maid nodded, smiling. “Aren’t you happy for her?”

  I couldn’t reply. I couldn’t breathe.

  I was taken aback by what had just happened. Could it be that my wolf was mistaken? I turned back to look at Olivia and the Alpha King.

  My mate.

  I stumbled backward, my breath coming in short gasps as the weight of those words sank in.

  No.

  This couldn’t be happening.

  My wolf whimpered, but she remained eerily silent. The bond that had just ignited inside me felt like it was being strangled before it could fully form. My heart ached, and my hands trembled at my sides as I watched Olivia smile up at him—my mate.

  The Alpha King.

  His eyes found mine again, and for a brief, torturous moment, I saw the conflict swirling within them. His jaw tightened, his fingers twitching at his side as if he were fighting the urge to reach for me. But Olivia’s laughter pulled him back, she clung to him, her delicate fingers resting against his chest possessively.

  I wanted to scream. I wanted to demand answers. But I couldn’t. Not here. Not now.

  I turned and ran.

  Murmurs followed me, whispers questioning my sudden exit, but I didn’t care. The grand hall blurred as I pushed through the doors, stepping into the cold night air. My lungs burned, my vision clouded by unshed tears.

  Was I wrong? Did I imagine the pull?

  No. I felt it. My wolf felt it.

  So why was my mate standing beside my sister?

  The pain was unbearable, a searing agony spreading through my chest. I clutched my arms around myself, stumbling toward my room.

  I reached my room, shutting the door behind me before collapsing onto my bed, sobbing. How had my life turned out like this? She had taken everything from me—my father’s love, the pack’s admiration, and now… my mate.

  Why, Olivia?

  Why did she always take everything from me?

  Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks. I wanted to scream, to break something, to demand answers—but what good would that do? No one ever listened to me. No one ever chose me.

  A soft knock at my door made me tense. I quickly wiped my tears and sat up, trying to compose myself. I hesitated before opening the door, and to my surprise, I found my father standing there.

  It had been years since I last saw him here.

  He walked past me into the room, the silence stretching between us before he finally spoke.

  “Your sister found her mate,” he said, his voice devoid of emotion.

  I scoffed. “Her mate? She stole mine,” I spat, my tone dripping with anger.

  His face remained expressionless, as if he already knew. “You have to let your sister be mated to him.” His tone left no room for argument.

  But I knew better than to stay silent. “Or I should tell him,” I challenged.

  “Tell who?” he asked sharply.

  “The Alpha King, of course,” I snapped.

  His expression darkened. “You will do no such thing.”

  “Watch me,” I countered, turning to leave the room.

  But before I could take another step, my father grabbed my arm and yanked me back.

  His gaze hardened. “You were never meant to have him, Raven. Accept it and stay silent. You will not tell anyone what happened if you still want to live,” he warned. “And for the time being, you will be locked up.”

  I gasped as he turned on his heel and walked out, leaving me stunned.

  Soon I heard the click of the door lock.

  He knew all along.

  I sank to the floor, tears flowing freely as I whispered, “He knew all along.”

  Suddenly, a sharp pain struck my heart, and I clutched my chest, gasping as the pain intensified.

  “What’s happening?” I whimpered to no one in particular. I rolled onto the ground, the pain unbearable.

  “Mate,” my wolf howled inside me, her voice filled with anguish.

  Then I realized.

  He was mating with my sister.

# Must Leave

Raven’s POV

  I clutched my chest as if that would ease the unbearable pain crushing me from the inside. My breath came in short gasps, and my vision blurred with the flood of tears spilling down my cheeks. My mate. The one the Moon Goddess has destined for me, was leaving, and he was leaving with my sister.

  How could he not feel the bond? How could he not sense me the way I sensed him? My wolf whimpered in my mind, still silent and withdrawn, as if the betrayal had shattered her spirit just as much as it had mine. She hadn't spoken to me since the moment I saw him standing next to Olivia, his hand resting protectively on her lower back. That touch was mine. He was mine. 

  I dragged myself up from the floor, my hands trembling as I gripped the edge of my bed. The window was still open, and the cold night air did nothing to soothe the fire of rage and heartbreak burning inside me. I forced myself to watch, even though it felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest with every passing second.

  Olivia turned, her face glowing with excitement as she wrapped her arms around him. He leaned in and whispered something in her ear, making her laugh. My stomach twisted violently. That laugh was supposed to be mine. Those whispered words—meant only for me. My nails dug into my palms, the pain grounding me even as my world crumbled.

  I wanted to scream, to run outside and tell him. Tell him the truth. That Olivia was nothing more than a thief, a liar, a traitor. That I was his fated mate, not her. That he was mine.

  But I couldn’t.

  My father made sure of that.

  His warning echoed in my mind like a sinister whisper: “Stay quiet, Raven. You don't deserve him. Olivia is the perfect Luna, not you.”

  I had wanted to fight back, to tell him that he was mistaken. That the bond wasn’t something he could change with a few cruel words and manipulation. But the look in his eyes told me he wouldn’t listen. He had already made his decision, already chosen Olivia over me. His real daughter. His real heir.

  I clenched my jaw, my whole body trembling as the car pulled away from the pack house, the sound of the tires against the gravel fading into the night. A piece of me left with them. A piece I would never get back.

  A sob escaped my lips, raw and broken. My wolf whimpered again, but still refused to surface. I needed her. I needed her strength. But she was just as lost as I was.

  I felt sick.

  Betrayal wrapped around me like chains, suffocating, and heavy. My own father had handed over my mate to her. My own blood. The sister who had never once treated me like family, who had taken everything from me since the moment we were born. And now, she had taken the one thing that was truly mine.

  I stumbled away from the window, my knees buckling beneath me as I collapsed onto my bed. My hands fisted the blankets, my nails digging into the fabric as I let out a silent scream. Why?

  Why didn’t he feel it? Why didn’t he look at me the way I looked at him? The way Olivia looked at him—like he was hers?

  Had the Goddess made a mistake?

  No. No, she wouldn’t. The bond wasn’t something that could be faked. He was mine. I was meant to be by his side, not Olivia. But she had taken him. They had taken him.

  And I had let them.

  My body shook violently as the reality of my situation sank in. I had nothing left.

  No mate. No family.

  Just pain.

  Tears soaked my pillow as I curled into myself, my breath coming in ragged gasps. My chest ached with a hollowness I had never felt before. And for the first time in my life, I realized something that sent a shiver down my spine.

  I wasn’t just heartbroken.

  I was alone.

  And I had no one except my wolf.

  Then I heard the door creak open. I was reluctant to move. I buried my face in the pillow as the door burst open. I felt footsteps approaching my bed, so I raised my head to see my father, a smile on his face.

  “What do you want, Father?” I yelled at him, the first time I had ever done that—but at this point, I didn’t care. He was a stranger to me.

  He took a long breath before speaking. “I just came to see how you are doin...”

  “Or came to see if I was broken by your betrayal?” I spat at him, cutting off his sentence.

  My father’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes darkened slightly, a flicker of something unreadable passing through them. He took a step closer, his towering presence making the room feel even smaller.

  “You should watch your tone, Raven,” he said smoothly, as if he wasn’t the one responsible for my suffering. As if he hadn’t just handed over my mate like I was nothing.

  I sat up, my hands gripping the sheets tightly. “Or what?” My voice was hoarse, laced with pain. “You’ve already taken everything from me. What more could you possibly do?”

  His lips curved into a smirk, but there was no warmth in it. “You act like this is the end, but it’s not. You’re stronger than you think, Raven. You’ll learn to accept your place.”

  “My place?” I let out a bitter laugh, shaking my head. “And where exactly is that, Father? In the shadows? Watching my mate love someone else? Watching my so-called family betray me over and over again?”

  He sighed, feigning disappointment. “Olivia was always meant to be Luna. You were never fit for the role, and you know it.”

  A growl rumbled in my throat, my wolf stirring faintly at his words. I wasn’t fit? I had trained harder than Olivia ever had. And yet, none of it mattered. Because in his eyes, I was never good enough.

  “Why?” My voice cracked as I looked into the face of the man who was supposed to protect me. “Why do you hate me so much?”

  For a moment—just a moment—something flickered in his expression. Guilt? Regret? But it was gone instantly, replaced by cold indifference.

  “You were never meant to be here,” he said simply, as if those words didn’t cut me deeper than any blade ever could. “Now, stop this pathetic display. Olivia and your mate will be happy together, and you will stay out of their way. Do you understand me?”

  Rage burned through me, hotter than ever before. I wanted to lash out, to scream, to make him hurt the way he had hurt me. But I knew it wouldn’t matter. Nothing I did would ever matter to him.

  I swallowed the lump in my throat, my nails digging into my palms. “Get out.”

  I yelled at him, my voice sharp and raged. “And don’t you dare think you have a daughter named Raven from now on,” I spat, hatred evident in my voice.

  He tilted his head slightly, as if contemplating my reaction, then let out a small chuckle. “As you wish.”

  He turned and walked toward the door, pausing only once to glance over his shoulder.

  “You’ll see, Raven. This is for the best.”

  And then he was gone.

  I stared at the closed door, my body trembling with barely contained emotion.

  How was he able to do it? How did my father and Olivia manipulated the mate bond? This was something I need to investigate But first, I needed to escape, I must leave this pack, and I will leave tonight.

# Mate Bond

Alpha Ethan’s POV

  Five Years Later

  I woke up to the early morning sun streaming through my window. Slowly, I opened my eyes, got out of bed, and drew the curtains closed. My gaze drifted to the sleeping Olivia, and I sighed. It had been five years since we were mated. Five long years.

  I walked into the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and took a cold shower. When I stepped out, a towel wrapped around my waist, I returned to the room, only to find the bed empty. Olivia was already gone. Shaking my head, I went to my closet, pulled out a heavy blue suit, and slipped it on. The fabric fit perfectly, accentuating my broad shoulders and muscular frame. I adjusted my tie, ran a hand through my slightly damp hair, and stepped out of the room.

  As I descended the stairs, the rich aroma of food filled the air, making me pause. This wasn’t the usual scent of meals prepared by the maids. My mind immediately went to Olivia. Could she be the one cooking? The thought almost made me laugh. Olivia never cooked. She never cared whether I had breakfast or not.

  Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to check the kitchen. Maybe she had changed.

  But as soon as I stepped inside, my hope was crushed. Elisa stood at the stove instead. I sighed.

  She turned at the sound of my footsteps, a warm smile on her face. “Good morning, brother.”

  I frowned. “You didn’t tell me you were coming back.”

  Elisa chuckled. “Chill, big brother. I wanted to surprise you, and I did, didn’t I?”

  I smirked. “So, tell me, how did you do it?”

  “You should already know. Didn’t you come here because of my cooking?” she teased, flipping an omelet onto a plate.

  A brief silence settled between us before I broke it. “I thought she was the one cooking,” I admitted, frustration lacing my voice.

  “She?” Elisa asked, her brow raised, but I didn’t respond.

  “Olivia?” she guessed.

  “Who else?” I muttered.

  Elisa sighed, shaking her head as she turned off the stove. “You should know by now that Olivia has never been the type to cook,” she said, disappointment evident in her voice.

  I ran a hand down my face, exhaling sharply. “I know,” I admitted, taking a seat at the kitchen counter. “It’s been five years, Elisa. Five damn years, and I still don’t feel the mate bond the way I’m supposed to. I thought it would grow, that maybe, with time, I’d feel something stronger. But every day, I wake up, and it feels… forced. Like I’m just going through the motions.”

  Elisa placed the plate in front of me, her expression unreadable. “Then why are you still holding on?” she asked, crossing her arms.

  I scoffed, picking up my fork but barely touching the food. “Because the bond is supposed to be sacred. Rejecting her after all these years would make me look weak. I thought maybe I was the problem. Maybe I wasn’t trying hard enough.” I clenched my jaw. “But regardless of what I do, Olivia is still the same. Cold. Distant. And when she does speak to me, it’s with nothing but irritation or demands. She barely acknowledges me unless she needs something.”

  Elisa sat across from me, her blue eyes filled with sympathy. “I’ve noticed,” she admitted. “She treats the pack like they’re beneath her, Ethan. Even the omegas fear her. She acts entitled, as if being Luna means everyone should serve her, but she gives nothing in return. You deserve more than that.”

  I let out a humorless chuckle. “Tell that to the elders. They believe Olivia is the perfect Luna. That she’s strong, independent, and exactly what this pack needs. If I go against that, I’ll have to justify rejecting my own mate. And honestly? I don’t even know where to start.”

  Elisa tapped my shoulder. “Then don’t force it.”

  Her words hit harder than I expected because deep down, I knew she was right. I had spent five years convincing myself that love would come, that the mate bond would eventually make everything right. But love couldn’t be forced. And whatever I had with Olivia—it was nothing like the stories I had grown up believing.

  I sighed, pushing my plate aside.

  Elisa hesitated before speaking again. “Be honest with yourself. And with Olivia. If she’s truly your mate, then ask yourself—why does she make you feel so empty?”

  I stared at my sister, her words settling deep into my bones. Olivia and I were bound by a mate bond, but it felt more like a chain than a connection. Every day with her was a reminder of what we lacked—what I lacked. Passion. Warmth. Love.

  Before I could respond, the sharp sound of heels clicking against the floor echoed through the hallway. A moment later, Olivia stepped into the kitchen, dressed in an elegant black dress that hugged her figure perfectly. Her hair was styled to perfection, and her makeup was flawless. She looked every bit the Luna the pack admired.

  But to me, she was nothing more than a stranger.

  Her sharp brown eyes flickered to me, then to Elisa. “What are you two talking about?” she asked, suspicion laced in her tone.

  I scoffed. “Is that how you greet your husband?” I spat in anger, my wolf silent but angry at her.

  Elisa, however, decided to speak. “We were just discussing how the mate bond is supposed to bring two people closer, not push them apart.”

  Olivia scoffed, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “The mate bond is what it is. We don’t have to be sickeningly in love, like some foolishly believe. We have an understanding, Ethan. That should be enough.”

  I clenched my jaw. “An understanding?” My voice was sharp, my patience thinning. “That’s all you have to say?”

  She crossed her arms. “Yes. You lead the pack. I stand by your side. We don’t need to pretend to be something we’re not.”

  I slammed my palm against the counter, making both Olivia and Elisa flinch. My wolf growled inside me, my dominance radiating through the room. “You are my mate, and you should act like it,” I snapped, my voice dangerously low.

  For five years, I had sacrificed my own happiness, waiting for her to change. But hell no—she only got worse.

  For the first time in a long while, Olivia hesitated. A flicker of nervousness crossed her face, but it vanished as quickly as it came. “Then that’s your problem,” she said smoothly, reaching for a cup of coffee.

  But I was faster. I grabbed her wrist, pulling her back. “You don’t walk out on me,” I growled. “I’m not just your mate—I’m your Alpha. And you will respect that.”

  I released her hand, making her lose her balance. She stumbled back and fell to the floor. 

  Just then, the door burst open. One of the guards on patrol ran in, gasping for breath.

  “Alpha,” he panted, worry in his eyes. “We’re under attack.”

# Rough Attack

Alpha Ethan's POV

“A rough attack,” I muttered to myself as I took in the chaos unfolding before me. The scent of blood tainted the air, mixing with the heavy aroma of damp earth and burning wood. The night had been eerily calm before the first howl shattered the silence, signaling the beginning of an invasion.

Without hesitation, I mind-linked my Beta, James. We’re under attack. Assemble all warriors immediately. We need everyone on the front lines—no exceptions.

James responded instantly, his voice sharp and alert. Understood, Alpha. How many are we dealing with?

I surveyed the battleground, my keen eyes picking up the swift-moving shadows in the tree line. More than a dozen, perhaps more, but something tells me this is just the beginning.  I sense more waiting beyond the trees. Move fast, James.

On it, he confirmed before cutting the link.

My claws elongated instinctively as I stepped forward, my wolf clawing beneath my skin, eager to be unleashed. I turned toward my Gamma, Caleb, who was already shifting, his powerful black wolf standing ready beside me.

“Hold the eastern flank,” I ordered, my voice laced with authority. “We cannot let them break through. If they do, the pack house will be vulnerable.”

Caleb growled in agreement before taking off, his massive form disappearing into the darkness.

A piercing snarl rang through the night as the first wave of rogues lunged forward, their eyes gleaming with savage hunger. I met them head-on, shifting mid-leap into my wolf form. My bones cracked and rearranged, fur bursting from my skin as I landed on all fours, fangs bared. The first rogue made the mistake of rushing me blindly—I clamped my jaws around its throat, snapping its windpipe with ease before tossing the lifeless body aside.

More followed, their movements frenzied and erratic. These weren’t ordinary rogues; they fought with an unsettling coordination, their attacks calculated. I barely had a moment to register this before three of them pounced at once. Twisting my body, I used their momentum against them, knocking two unbalanced while sinking my teeth into the third’s hind leg. A pained yelp filled the air as I dragged the rogue down, tearing into its flesh until it stopped moving.

Through the haze of battle, James’ voice rang in my mind again. Warriors are assembled and moving into position. We have around seventy on the field now, but I sent a distress call to the allied packs. If this is an organized assault, we’ll need reinforcements.

Good. We hold our ground until they arrive, I replied, dodging a rogue’s snapping jaws. I retaliated with a brutal swipe of my claws, shredding across its face.

Shouts and snarls filled the air as our warriors clashed with the rogues. The night pulsed with the violent symphony of battle—bodies colliding, bones crunching, pained cries echoing into the darkness. My pack fought fiercely, but the rogues kept coming, their numbers seemingly endless.

Then, from the shadows beyond the tree line, a figure emerged—a tall, imposing man, his scent foreign yet oddly familiar. Unlike the rogues, he didn’t charge into battle. Instead, he stood still, his piercing gaze locked onto me.

A growl rumbled deep in my chest as I took a step forward, readying myself. Whoever he was, he wasn’t just another rogue.

This attack wasn’t random. It was planned.

And the real fight was just beginning.

The rogue in front of me lunged, but I was faster. I slammed my weight into it, sending it crashing into the dirt before snapping its neck. Blood sprayed the ground as I turned to face the next attacker.

We were holding our ground, but barely. The rogues were relentless, their numbers growing instead of thinning. James and Caleb fought fiercely beside me, but I could see exhaustion beginning to creep into their movements. Our warriors were strong, but the onslaught was wearing us down.

Then, just as a massive rogue barreled toward me, something changed. A powerful presence rippled through the battlefield, a force unlike anything I had felt before. The air grew thick with energy, and for a moment, even the rogues hesitated.

A golden blur shot through the darkness, its movements swift and lethal. The massive wolf landed in front of me, its golden fur gleaming even under the dim moonlight. It moved with an otherworldly grace, its eyes burning with an intensity that made even the most savage rogues falter.

I had never seen this wolf before.

And yet, something about it felt familiar.

The golden wolf wasted no time, launching itself into the fray with devastating efficiency. It tore through the enemy lines, its powerful jaws crushing bones, its claws slicing through flesh like they were nothing. The rogues scrambled to defend themselves, but they were no match.",1,1753949293.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

One afternoon I’d popped into a coffee shop, barely talking above a mumble as I ordered. But the barista greeted me with the biggest smile, complimented my earrings (which I’d worn on a whim), and tucked a note inside my cup that just said, “Hope today gets gentler for you.”
It was such a tiny gesture, but it cracked something open in me I realized how much difference a little recognition makes when you’re struggling. That day, just knowing someone took a second to pour a bit of kindness my way was enough to nudge me back into the world with a softer heart. I paid it forward right after, buying coffee for the next person in line. Sometimes the smallest kindnesses show up exactly when you need them most, in places you don’t expect.

Subject-Property-343 was undeniably one of those rare figures. For years, if you wandered through the subreddit dedicated for hip-hop/trap artist Playboi Carti, his name was as familiar as morning coffee, as constant as the tide.

Most pilgrims to r/playboicarti came seeking communion with their beloved artist's mystique. But Subject-Property-343 harbored grander ambitions for his flock. Certainly, he served as their faithful herald, delivering Carti leaks and cryptic Instagram whispers with lightning precision that bordered on the supernatural. One Redditor summed it up:

>""30‑year‑old guy freakishly obsessed w karma who posts opium’s every move to 7 different subs 3 seconds after it comes out and spreads weird ass narratives.""

Yet his vision extended far beyond the realm of vampire aesthetics and Opium lore.

In his curious universe, the devoted followers of Playboi Carti deserved nothing less than complete enlightenment about the world's unfolding dramas. A pope's final breath, a celebrity's stumble from grace, the tremors of international affairs—all found their way into his sacred digital sanctuary. It was beautifully bewildering, watching serious global events bloom like unexpected flowers among discussions of red leather and baby voices.

He inspired fierce devotion and equally fierce opposition. To his faithful, he was an tireless shepherd of information, keeping vigil over both music and world alike. To his detractors, he was a karma-obsessed oracle whose relentless posting bordered on the divine madness of ancient seers. Perhaps both tribes glimpsed different facets of the same truth.

Even those who found his methods maddening couldn't deny the poetry of his dedication. Here was someone who had transformed the simple act of posting into an art form, accumulating over 1 million karma like a digital alchemist transmuting attention into something approaching immortality.

What elevated him beyond mere internet folklore was that precious moment of vulnerability when he paused his endless broadcasting. Upon reaching one million karma, instead of triumphant boasting, he offered something far more beautiful: genuine gratitude. He spoke tenderly of friendships forged in comment threads, of finding home in the most unlikely digital corners:

>""I am grateful for all of the friends I have made along the way throughout this journey from cashcartiwhatscyeah, 19toofar, AimanHakim249, LanaReysServant, SadeKissofLifeee, and countless others who have come and gone through this sub. They have truly made this small part of the internet feel like home. We may never know each other in our every day real life lives, but I cherish the friendships I have fostered on this platform.""

It was the kind of revelation that reminded us all that behind every username beats a human heart, seeking connection in whatever strange forms the modern world provides.

Now the great chronicler has fallen silent, claimed by Reddit's mysterious administrative forces. The Carti subreddit breathes differently in his absence—quieter perhaps, like a forest after the songbirds have flown south. Some celebrate this newfound peace, while others find themselves unexpectedly mourning the loss of their most peculiar guardian.

Whatever else may be said, Subject-Property-343 wove himself into the tapestry of internet legend. He transformed a humble music forum into his personal kingdom of information, ruling with benevolent chaos until the very end.

r/playboicarti feels a little less magical without his strange devotion illuminating the shadows.

1mdvozn,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mdvozn/my_husband_wants_an_open_marriage/,My Husband Wants An Open Marriage,"My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.

“And I………will always love you…..” he sings, closing his eyes.

His voice is terrible.

Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan's waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She’s younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she’s the funniest person in the world.

I’ve never seen him this happy.

The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they're shining for someone else.

Around me, everyone is laughing. It’s the company’s quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily’s performance hilarious. But I know what they’re really laughing at. They’re laughing at me. The CEO’s wife, sitting here while her husband practically gropes his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don’t even try to hide it.

“Do you think they’re going to kiss?” someone whispers behind me.

“Definitely. Bet they’ll be doing more than kissing after this,” someone else replies, and they both chuckle.

I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company’s hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer’s wife.

Or maybe they just don’t care.

The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. “Hi!” she says, a little too loud. “Do you work here?”

Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She's definitely an intern.

She’s pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.

I don’t respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.

Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.

“Julie!” the voice says, drawing my attention.

Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan’s company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she’s one of the few who calls out my name like we’re friends, even though we’re not.

“Samantha,” I reply, forcing a polite smile.

“I didn’t know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!”

“Oh?” I say. “Why’s that?”

“Well, you’re the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You’re so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,” she says, with an overplayed wink.

Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they’re on some private date instead of a work event.

“So, Mrs. O’Brien,” she says, smirking, “how are you enjoying the show so far?”

She's mocking me. The fucking bitch.

I force a bright smile. “Oh, it’s… fantastic,” I say, struggling to keep a straight face. “I’m thrilled to see my husband’s hard work is being rewarded with such… dedication from his staff.”

The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they're done with their nonsense.

But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. “Before we get down, we’ve got one more song for you!”

More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.

Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. “Well… umm,” she says. “I’ll catch up with you later.”

She quickly excuses herself.

Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. “Oh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That's Mrs. O’Brien.”

I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. “Let’s go,” he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.

Good. Let them run.

I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing “Everything I Do”—if you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She’s completely shameless, and he’s too drunk to even notice—or worse, he doesn’t care.

I can’t take it anymore.

Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what’s happening. They’ve been waiting for this—waiting to see if I’ll crack.

But I don’t care. I’m done playing the perfect wife.

I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn’t notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.

“Ryan,” I say. “We’re leaving now.”

Ryan looks at me, surprised. “Why?” he slurs, still holding the microphone. “The party's just getting started.”

I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. “Let’s go. Now.”

“Julie, come on,” he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I’m the one ruining his night.

I can’t help it. Something inside me snaps.

Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.

“Who’s in charge here?” I ask.

They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.

“Mrs. O’Brien,” he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. “Is there something—uh—something I can do for you?”

“Shut it down. All of it,” I say. “The party’s over.”

He blinks, not sure if I’m serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that’s left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage.

Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.

“Julie, what the hell?” Ryan mutters.

I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I’ve been holding in for too long. “You’ve had your fun,” I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. “Now it’s over.”

I don’t wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.

Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone’s too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense.

The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh.

Ryan's too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he’s the one who’s quiet, and I’m the one in control.

Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.

Ryan mumbles something under his breath—maybe an apology, maybe an excuse—but I don’t stop. I don’t even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.

“Take us home,” I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.

# CHAPTER 002: An Open Marriage

It’s true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.

In my case, I’m the unhappy one.

I’m the one who can’t sleep. I’m the one who watches her husband’s sleeping face at night, looking for a sign—anything to prove what I’ve suspected all along, that he’s cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That’s all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.

But Ryan never does. He’s too controlled for that.

I’m the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can’t see the name of the sender, can’t recognize the face due to the image size—though it looks like Emily. I can’t even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.

I’m in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it’s just 6 AM.

“Morning,” Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. “Feels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.”

“I’m glad you had fun,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.

“Something wrong?” Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.

“Wrong?”

“You seem… I don’t know, off.”

I’m counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm the hell down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn’t even remember?

“I’m fine,” I say.

Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He’s watching me with that innocent look of his.

Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn’t recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.

Funny how things turn out.

“You say you’re fine,” Ryan says, breaking the silence, “but you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.”

I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. “You humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn’t?”

“What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about your stupid karaoke performance yesterday with that bitch, Emily.”

Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. “Oh, not this again. I’ve told you a hundred times, Julie, there’s nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you’re obsessed or something.”

“Obsessed?”

I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn’t the wall.

“You have a life most women would kill for,” he continues. “A great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family’s bills. I’ve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it’s never enough, is it? You’re always whining about the same thing—Emily this, Emily that. It’s exhausting.”

I’m shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he’ll call my mother again, and she’ll tell me I’m being ungrateful. “Stop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,” she’ll say. “No one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you’re sorry for being a bitch.”

“How would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?” I say, glaring at Ryan. “Should I commission a carven image of you and worship it?”

“I’m not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.” Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now’s the right time.”

Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He’s going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom’s going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.

“What is it?” I ask, bracing myself.

“I want an open marriage.”

For a moment, the words don’t register. “What?” I say.

“That’s when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and—”

“I know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.”

He looks at me with disdain. “I wasn’t asking. From now on, we’re in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don’t bother asking questions.”

My heart slams in my chest. “It’s only an open marriage if I agree. And I don’t.”

I’m on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I’m already gearing close to a heart attack.

“I want kids, Julie,” Ryan says. “How am I supposed to have any if I don’t date someone else?”

I can’t help it; I begin to cry. “But it’s not my fault.”

“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”

I can’t believe he said that. We’ve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it’s always the same reply: you’re both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.

I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I’m standing naked in front of him. Ryan’s eyes widen in surprise.

I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. “Does this not move you anymore?”

“Julie—”

“Am I ugly to you now?” I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.

“Stop it,” he says firmly, putting space between us. “Put your clothes back on.”

Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs.

“Wait,” I call out, my voice shaky.

Ryan turns, impatient. “What?”

“It’s cool,” I say, my voice hollow. “Let’s have an open marriage.”

Ryan nods. “Good.”

And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.

\~\~\~

I like to say I’m a calm person. Sometimes I swear I’m the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I’ve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I’ve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I’ve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie’s house. Because their parents knew I’m a decent person.

But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.

I’m watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Fucking Emily. And she’s carrying suitcases.

“What’s going on?” I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.

Ryan smiles. “Julie, meet Emily.”

“I know who she is, Ryan.”

“Good. Then I won’t need to explain. Emily’s moving in.”

I’m honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, “Is she homeless?”

“No,” Ryan says. “She’s my girlfriend now.”

# CHAPTER 003: The Bar

I look at Ryan, then Emily. “I don’t understand.”

Ryan doesn’t even look at me, just grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away. “Stop being such a bad host, Julie. We’ve had a long day.”

“No way, Ryan. She’s not staying in this house,” I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.

He doesn’t respond. They’re already halfway up the stairs.

“Do you hear me? She’s not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don’t want her in my house.”

Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. “Your house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she’s staying, she’s staying. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. I don’t have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.”

Oh, my god. My chest tightens. “How could you do this?” I say. “Don’t walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.”

Emily turns to look at me, smirking. “By the way, you’ll need to move your things into the guest room. I’m not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It’s bad enough sharing him with you.”

All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They’re kicking me out of my own room.

The living room suddenly feels too small.

I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t be here.

“Ma’am, are you alright?” Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He’s wiping down Ryan’s Rolls-Royce, eyeing me with concern.

I hold out my hand. “The keys.”

“Ma’am?”

“The damn keys, Justin.”

He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he’s wondering why I need Ryan’s car when I have my own. Honestly, I don’t know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.

“Mrs. O’Brien, let me drive you—”

“No, Justin. I’ll drive myself.”

I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.

\~\~\~

It’s been over an hour, and I’m still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything—Ryan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I’d planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I’m no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It’s not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he’s bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?

The craziest thing is I can’t cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger—just this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it’s a defense mechanism. That I’m in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.

Well, they can all go to hell. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.

I know what I need. A drink.

I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.

“A shot of whiskey,” I tell the bartender. “Neat. And keep them coming.”

“Long night?”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say.

He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It’s harsh, but it’s better than the alternative—thinking about what’s happening back home.

As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, “Maggie! Maggie!”

I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he’s wrapping his arms around me. “Thank God I found you,” he says, pulling me into a tight hug.

I stiffen. “Who the hell are you?”

“Please, just go along with it,” he whispers in my ear. “I’ll explain later. I promise.”

Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.

“Luke! I knew it. You can’t hide from me.”

The stranger—Luke, apparently—turns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. “Veronica, what a surprise,” he says, feigning nonchalance.

“My name isn’t Veronica, it’s Evelyn.”

Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. “Right, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie—my wife.”

He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?

Evelyn glares at me. “You married this scumbag?”

I don’t know what to say, so I just nod.

“You should divorce him,” she snaps. “He spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?”

“But that's what we agreed on. A one-night st—” Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off.

“Fuck you, Luke.”

And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.

Luke breathes a sigh of relief. “Well, that one was a stalker. At least she's off my back now.” He turns to me, smiling. “Can I buy you a drink? You’ve definitely earned it.”

I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can't even process it. I think I need that drink.

“Make it two,” I say.

And Luke smiles.

# CHAPTER 004: The Deal

\~\~Luke\~\~

Lord knows I’ve seen my fair share of beauties.

But the lady beside me is something else. Not only is she the prettiest thing I’ve seen, but she’s married. Some men are just lucky.

“So, I’m guessing your name isn’t Maggie?” I ask, trying to ease the tension.

“No,” she replies flatly.

I nod, waiting for her to give me something more. “So, what is it?”

She gives me a slow, deliberate look. I can’t lie, wherever her eyes touch immediately burns.

“Look,” I say, raising my hands in mock surrender. “I’m not hitting on you. Honestly, I’m taking a break from women. They’re problematic.”

She lets out a laugh, a bitter one. “You’re the one who just hugged a stranger to dodge another woman you’ve clearly wronged, and you’re saying we’re the problematic ones? You men are all the same.”

She downs her drink like it’s water and winces at the burn. That’s her second shot in less than five minutes. I’ve got to say, I’m impressed.

“Let’s start over,” I suggest, offering her a fresh start. “I’m Luke.”

She rolls her eyes. “Yeah, I caught that. Your ‘problematic’ ex wouldn’t shut up about it.”

“She's not my ex,” I say.

“Whatever.”

Great, another woman convinced I’m the villain. Not even five minutes in and she’s already pegged me as the problem. I guess I deserve that one.

“So, are you going to tell me your name?” I ask, trying again.

I can tell she’s got money just by looking at her. She’s probably an heiress or the wife of some big-shot businessman. Those Louboutins, the Rolls-Royce keys sitting on the bar, and that dress—all of it screams wealth. Maybe that’s why she’s not keen on giving me her real name.

“You don’t have to tell me your last name,” I say with a grin. “But you look like you could use someone to talk to. Since you just saved my ass back there, I figure it’s the least I can do.”

She watches me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before finally relenting. “Julie. My name’s Julie.”

“Nice to meet you, Julie,” I say, extending my hand.

She takes it.

\~\~\~

Julie’s on her fifth glass of whiskey, and at this point, she’s unstoppable, pouring out her life story like we’ve known each other for years. I’ve already told the bartender to cut her off, but she hasn’t noticed yet.

“...So, I’m standing there, and they’re both going upstairs. To my room. And do you know what the bitch says?” Julie doesn’t wait for me to reply. “She says I need to move out of my room. My room.” She laughs so hard that she starts coughing. And then, just as suddenly, she’s sobbing.

I don’t know what to do. How do you comfort someone else’s wife without crossing a line?

“Julie,” I say. “Are you okay?”

She shakes her head. “I need another drink.”

“No, you don’t.”

She frowns at me. “What? You think I need one more person telling me how to live my life? You can all go to hell. I said I need a drink.” She taps her empty glass against the bar, but the bartender, Mart, knows better than to disobey me.

“Sorry, I own the bar, and I can’t let you drink anymore,” I say.

Her eyes narrow. “Oh, you own the bar? Good for you. I’ll find another one.”

She tries to stand, but I step in her path.

“Listen, Julie, I know you’re hurting, but this isn't the way to go about it. Have you thought about divorce?”

For the first time, her eyes soften, and she slumps back onto the barstool. “I can’t. I don’t want to be a disappointment to my family. They depend on Ryan’s money.”

I let out a snort. “Screw them. It’s your life. No one should make you feel like this.”

She gives a sarcastic smile. “Easy for you to say, Mr. I-own-the-bar.”

I’ve seen people like Julie before, people who won’t leave a toxic relationship because, deep down, they still love the person. She’s saying it’s because of her family, but I can tell it’s more than that. She’s not ready to let go of him. Love does that to you—it makes you hold on even when you shouldn’t. I know that feeling all too well.

What kind of solution could I possibly suggest that wouldn’t involve me physically dragging her out of the marriage?

Suddenly, an idea hits me. “You know what?” I say. “You need to get yourself a boyfriend. Someone to introduce to Ryan.”

“A boyfriend?” She looks at me like I’ve lost my mind.

It sounds like a stupid plan, but one thing I know about guys who cheat is that they can't stand being cheated on. It’ll drive him crazy. I’m hoping it leads to Ryan divorcing her, since she’s too chicken to do it herself.

“It doesn’t have to be a real relationship,” I add. “Just hire someone to play that role until Ryan comes back to his senses.”

Julie’s quiet for a moment, turning the idea over in her head. “That’s actually not bad,” she says, surprising me. “Are all bar owners this good at giving advice?”

I laugh. “We try.”

“Okay, but where am I supposed to find this ‘boyfriend’?”

Without thinking, I blurt out, “I could do it.”

Her eyes flicker over me again, slower this time. “You?”

“It’s easier than hiring someone. No need to go through the hassle of finding the right guy, making sure he knows what he’s doing. I’m single, not looking for a relationship, and I like a little adventure. I’d be perfect for the job.”

She studies me, weighing her options. After a moment, she says, “You are good-looking too.”

I raise an eyebrow, but she cuts me off.

“Don’t ask.” She pulls out her phone. “So, how much is this going to cost me?”

I hadn’t thought about money. I don’t need it, but if I offer to do it for free, it might seem weird.

“How much are you willing to pay?” I ask, playing along.

She glances around the bar, one arm raised as if to appraise the place. Her diamond ring catches the light, sparkling like it’s worth a fortune.

“Your bar’s decent,” she says. “What does it make? Two hundred thousand a year? Maybe five?”

I stay silent.

“I’ll double that,” she says.

I raise an eyebrow. “The two hundred?”

“The five hundred.”

Wow. She’s serious. “Deal. But I’ll only take the money after we pull it off.”

She extends her hand. “Deal.”

I shake her hand, her skin soft against mine. I then pull out a pen and scribble my number on a napkin. “Call me when you’re ready.”

She tucks the napkin into her purse and gives me one last look before heading out of the bar. I'm right behind her, escorting her toward a sleek Rolls-Royce.

“You sure you can drive?” I ask.

“I’m not that high, Luke.”

“Alright,” I say. “Give me a call.”

She drives off into the night.

I feel so guilty for letting her leave in that state. But what else could I do? I head back into the bar, already wondering what I’ve gotten myself into.

# CHAPTER 005: Breakfast News

\~\~Julie\~\~

Ugh, my head feels like it weighs a thousand pounds.

I crack my eyes open and glance around. I’m in my living room, but I can’t for the life of me remember how I got home last night.

Shit, Ryan’s car.

I scramble to the window, heart racing, and peek outside. There it is, still parked in the driveway. Thank God. Ryan would have been so pissed if I’d wrecked it.

I need a shower. And definitely a toothbrush. My mouth tastes like something died in it.

I drag myself upstairs, but as soon as I push open the master bedroom door, I freeze. Emily is on top of Ryan, both of them completely naked, moving in sync. Their panting fills the room.

I scream.

Emily yelps and tumbles off him, scrambling to cover herself.

“Jesus Christ, Julie,” Ryan mutters, sitting up and glaring at me. “Ever heard of knocking?”

I want to tell him I’ve never had to knock in my own house, let alone my own bedroom, but what’s the point? “I just came to grab my things.”

“It’s already done,” Emily snaps. “Everything you own is in the guest room.”

I nod stiffly and close the door. If I stay in this hallway a second longer, I might decide to walk back in there with a knife. So I climb down the stairs slowly, counting down from ten. You’ve got this, Julie. You’re doing great.

When I get to the guest room, I see Emily’s handiwork. My things are scattered everywhere—on the floor, on the bed, like some chaotic display of disrespect. I’m too tired and hungry to deal with it now.

In the shower, I let the hot water wash over me, willing it to cleanse the pain of yesterday, today, and whatever fresh hell tomorrow brings. The sound of the water is like white noise, drowning out the sobs I refuse to let out. I won’t cry for Ryan. I won’t cry for Emily.

“Martha?” I call, heading into the kitchen where our cook is busy with breakfast.

“Good morning, ma’am,” Martha says, glancing over. “Hope you slept well?”

“Like a baby,” I lie. “I’m starving, though.”

“I’ll bring your food in a moment. Please, take a seat.”

A few minutes later, she sets a plate in front of me, and I blink, surprised. Just a few pieces of lettuce and some sad-looking greens.

“Where’s the rest of it?” I ask, lifting an eyebrow.

“The new missus says we’re no longer allowed to cook high-calorie meals,” Martha explains, looking nervous. “I told her you had a meal plan, but Mr. O’Brien said I’d lose my job if I didn’t follow Ms. Emily’s orders.”

Of course. The little snake is starting a war. First, she takes my husband. Now, she’s messing with my kitchen. Game on.

“That’s fine, Martha. You’re just doing your job.”

I stare at the plate of greens, my stomach growling. I force a bite down, trying not to gag. It’s no wonder Emily’s so tiny—she eats like a rabbit. I try to finish it out of respect for Martha, but every bite feels like torture.

My mind drifts back to last night. Should I call Luke? How are we even supposed to pull off this fake boyfriend plan?

I grab my phone and shoot him a quick text, saving his number under Luke Escort. “Hi, it’s the drunk rich lady from last night. Just letting you know I got home safely, and no scratches on the car. I’ll be in touch about our plan. Cheers.”

I hit send.

Within seconds, his reply comes in. “Who?”

Oh, my god. He doesn’t remember me. Now that’s awkward.

But then he sends, “Kidding. I’ll keep my fingers crossed, Julie.”

Ugh. He’s insufferable.

Just then, I hear footsteps on the stairs. Ryan and Emily appear, hand in hand, looking smug.

“Good morning, Julie!” Emily chirps, smiling too brightly. Her teeth look expensive. “How was breakfast?”

I return her smile. “Delicious. Exactly what I needed. You’re right, we should all be eating like New Yorkers—everyone’s so tiny these days, they might start building smaller doors.”

Emily giggles, clearly missing my sarcasm. “That’s so true, Julie! Martha, we’re ready for our breakfast too.”

Martha brings them the same sad plate of greens she gave me. I smirk as Ryan takes a bite and immediately struggles not to spit it out.

“You like it, babe?” Emily asks.

Ryan nods, chewing reluctantly. “Yeah, it’s… nice.”

Perfect. Now, time to give him something else to choke on.

“You know,” I say, leaning back in my chair, “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I realize I gave you a hard time, Ryan. You didn’t deserve that.”

He glances at me warily, sensing something’s off.

“You’re my husband,” I continue, keeping my tone sweet. “And everyone’s entitled to their desires, even if they don’t make sense. So, I’ve decided I’m fully on board with this arrangement.”

Ryan doesn’t look comfortable. After all these years, he knows when I’m bullshitting.

But Emily does not. She seems genuinely relieved. “That’s great to hear, Julie! I mean, humans were never meant to be monogamous.”

“Is that so?” I say, raising an eyebrow.

“Definitely. From the beginning of time, our ancestors were explorers.”

Right. Biology lessons from the woman sleeping with my husband. Fascinating.

“Exactly why I’ve decided to do some exploring myself,” I say, watching their faces closely. “I’ve found myself a boyfriend.”

Ryan freezes, fork halfway to his mouth. Emily’s smile falters.

“Boyfriend?” Ryan asks, his voice tight.

I grin, enjoying the moment. “That’s right, honey. I figure it’s only fair. If you’re going to explore, so am I.”

# CHAPTER 006: A Manipulator

Ryan has been quiet since I dropped the news.

“Say something,” I say, my voice breaking slightly. But Ryan just stares at me, his jaw clenched, his face rigid. I know that look too well. It's his bomb-ticking look, the one he wears when he's moments away from an explosion.

“Julie,” Emily says. She glances at Ryan before going on, “I’m sure whoever you’ve chosen will be wonderful. After all, you found Ryan and kept him, so you must know how to make good choices in life.”

Her smile makes my fingers itch. I want to grab something—anything—and hurl it at her. My nails dig into my palms. Stay calm, I remind myself. If I react, Ryan will just assume I’ve lost my mind, and then where will I be? How would I fight for my marriage from an asylum?

“No,” Ryan says, catching me off guard.

“What?”

“The answer is no, Julie,” he says, cold and final.

I stare at him, not believing he just said that. “It wasn’t a request, Ryan. I was letting you know I’m exploring new options. So when you see me with someone else, you don’t ask unnecessary questions.”

His eyes narrow, and for the first time in a long while, I see anger in those green eyes. “Are you throwing my words back at me? Is that what this is? A game? You want to get me jealous by making up some boyfriend? Was that your grand plan?”

“Why would I want to get you jealous, Ryan?”

“Because that’s what you do, Julie.” His voice rises. “You’re a manipulator. Everything you say or do has a purpose. But this? This is crossing the line. You’re not getting a boyfriend, and that’s final!”

He slams his hand down on the table, sending a glass teetering over. Water splashes across Emily’s dress.

“Jesus Christ, Ryan!” Emily yells, standing up. “What has gotten into you?”

Ryan’s on his feet in a second, arms wrapping around her. His voice is soft and soothing as he apologizes into her hair. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…”

I stare at the wet patch on the table, willing myself not to break, not to let a single tear fall. If I cry, he’ll think he’s won. And I won’t give him that satisfaction. I need to stay strong. Ryan’s not in his right mind—he’s not thinking clearly—and I can change him. I just need to push a little harder.

Emily disentangles herself from Ryan and sits back down, smoothing her dress. She clears her throat. “Forgive Ryan for the outburst, Julie. He gets overwhelmed by little things sometimes.” She smiles, that same condescending smile. “It’s nice that you want to explore. We all deserve happiness.”

Her words make my skin crawl. A typical secretary, covering for her boss. I guess I’m the stranger in this marriage now.

Ryan drops back into his chair, his posture stiff but more composed than before. “You have me, Julie. I’m always here. What more happiness are you looking for?”

“Ryan,” Emily warns.

“No, Emily, stay out of this.” His voice is harsh now, and for a moment, I see the cracks in his composure. “Julie is my wife. You think I’m just going to let some random guy waltz into our lives and ‘hang out’ with her? What if he’s a con artist? Or worse, a kidnapper? You don’t know him! What if he’s just using her for her money?”

Emily doesn’t wait for him to finish. She stands up, turning on her heel and heading for the stairs.

“Honey, where are you going?” Ryan asks, panicking as he chases after her.

“I’m taking my things and leaving,” she says without looking back.

“Why would you do that? Please, let's talk about this.”

She pauses halfway up the stairs, turning just enough to throw a scathing look over her shoulder. “Because you don’t value my opinions, Ryan. You never have. How can I stay with someone who refuses to listen to me?”

His voice is pleading now. “Emily, please. What do you want? Just tell me, and I’ll do it.”

“Let Julie have her relationship,” she says.

Ryan stops in his tracks, his face pale, as though he's been slapped. For a moment, I think he’s going to scream, but instead, he just looks at her calmly. There’s a long pause before he turns to me. “Fine. I’ll let you have a boyfriend on one condition.”

“What’s that?” I say.

“I meet him. Whoever this guy is, I want to see him. Face to face.” His voice is quiet, but it carries an edge. “I have a lunch appointment tomorrow with a potential business partner. You can bring him over... thirty minutes into the break.”

I did not expect that. I wanted an explosion. I wanted Ryan to fall to his knees and beg me not to see someone else. I wanted him to finally show me that he still cared. But this… I recognize what it is. He’s calling my bluff. He thinks I’m lying, that this “boyfriend” of mine is just a desperate attempt to get under his skin. And by giving me until tomorrow, he’s daring me to prove him wrong. The worst part is that I can see the satisfaction in his eyes. He thinks I’m cornered, that I’ll back down and admit there is no other man.

It takes every ounce of strength not to snap at him, not to let him see how much his words sting. Instead, I keep my voice steady, my face neutral. “Agreed.”

His eyes narrow a little, surprised.

Emily clears her throat. She’s standing by the stairs now, her arms crossed, watching the scene unfold.

“Ryan,” she says. “We should go.”

Ryan doesn’t respond right away. Instead, he stares at me. The silence between us feels heavy, almost suffocating. His eyes are searching mine, waiting for me to crack.

But I won’t.

“Julie,” he says, “I hope you know what you’re doing.”

“I do.”

Ryan doesn’t say anything else. I can see the hurt in his eyes, the anger too, but he won’t admit it. That would mean losing control, and Ryan never loses control.

Emily watches us, impatient. “Ryan,” she says again, firmer this time. “We need to go.”

Finally, Ryan pulls his gaze away from me and walks to the door. His steps are slow. I stand still, my heart pounding as I watch him leave.

At the door, he stops and looks back at me.

We lock eyes, and I see the man I fell in love with, the man who once promised me forever. Then, just as quickly, his face hardens, and he walks out, closing the door behind him.

Emily follows, her heels clicking on the floor. She doesn’t look at me as she leaves.

I walk to the window, watching as Ryan and Emily get into his car. He’s still staring at the house, even as he opens the door for her, like he’s expecting me to burst out and stop them. His hand lingers on the door handle longer than it should, his posture tense.

I can’t breathe. My heart is pounding so loudly in my chest, I can barely think.

His eyes meet mine one last time through the window. Then he turns away, gets in the car, and drives off.

\~\~\~

Someone's in my bed. I can feel the person's hand in my hair. I smell alcohol in their breath.

I’m slowly coming awake, trying to figure out if it's real or if I’m still dreaming.

But then I hear my name, “Jules.”

That name. Only one person calls me that.

You know, the kind of stuff that waits on my to-do list for ages, even though I know how good I'll feel once it's done. Like, I love painting, but there are timees I just can't bring myself to pick up that brush, even if a part of my brain keeps whispering how much I'll love the end result.

I wonder if maybe it all comes down to some invisible motives deep down. Is it a fear of not being perfect or living up to expectations, maybe? 🤔 Or perhas it's the daunting feling of starting something that culd potentially lead to a series of otber twsks waiting in line, makibg it all feel exhausting before I even start.

Or it could be that I just need a breather, and my mind is trying to signal that, but it comes across as procrastination. Cuold the hidden piece be that I'm subconciously trying to avoid decision fatigue by not diving into decisions that could lead to more choices? Might be wrong, but it makes me think that perhaps some of these hidden motivations are more about avoidance and less about being lazy.

1mdvmmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mdvmmi/where_my_heart_was_hidden/,Where My Heart Was Hidden,"The juiciest scandal of the year at Kaverton University was the leaked sex tape of Elizabeth Fisher from the Art Department.

The video had been filmed in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel.

Elizabeth was completely naked, pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window by a man a full head taller than her. The sounds of their bodies moving in sync echoed steadily through the room.

When they finished, the man leaned close to her ear and murmured, ""Good girl.""

That phrase hit the group chat like a bomb, sending shockwaves across campus.

""That voice… No way! Is that Daniel?""

""Elizabeth's got serious game if she landed one of the university's board members. No wonder all the girls who used to bully her suddenly shut up.""

""I always thought Elizabeth was some innocent girl. Turns out she's a calculating bitch—like mother, like daughter.""

When the news reached Elizabeth, she was in her dorm, knitting a scarf for Daniel Woolridge.

Her roommate blasted the video at full volume, passing the phone around with a mocking grin.

She stretched her voice in exaggerated glee. ""Elizabeth, you're moaning like a pro. How much practice have you had?""

Laughter exploded around the room.

Elizabeth froze, her face draining of color. The half-finished scarf slipped from her hands as she bolted out the door.

She stumbled to Daniel's office, desperate to confront him, to ask what was going on.

But just as she reached the door, she heard a voice inside—sarcastic and biting.

""Daniel, you didn't leave Elizabeth a shred of dignity, huh? You made sure her face was crystal clear in the video. She doesn't even have a chance to deny it.""

Elizabeth's mind went blank. A deafening roar filled her ears as cold dread swept through her body.

""She brought it on herself. Messing with the woman Daniel loves most? She got what she deserved.""

""Yeah, poor Daniel. Not only did he have to spread rumors about Elizabeth's mom being a homewrecker, but he also had to play the hero, pretending to protect her from bullies and acting like he was madly in love.""

""By the way, Daniel, when are you planning to tell her the truth? If she finds out the guy she's been in love with is actually her future brother-in-law, she's going to pass out on the spot!""

Daniel lounged on the couch, looking utterly at ease, a cigarette dangling between his fingers as he tapped the ashes into the tray. His face was unreadable behind a thin haze of smoke.

Noticing the silence, one of his friends quickly added, ""Feeling sorry for her? Don't forget that she went all out to get Cheryl exiled abroad for two whole years. Do you think we should just let her off the hook after that? Cheryl was starving and freezing out there!""

At the mention of Cheryl Fisher, Daniel finally stirred.

He stubbed out the cigarette and said calmly, ""We'll wait until Cheryl's back. That day also happens to be a special anniversary that Elizabeth has been looking forward to. I'll give her a little 'surprise.' She'll pay back everything she owes Cheryl.""

Elizabeth's breath caught in her throat.

Through the smoke, her eyes locked onto Daniel's cold, sharp profile. Something inside her cracked wide open. The pain in her chest nearly knocked her off her feet.

So, all those disgusting rumors about her mother—they'd come from him? His affection—his protection, it had all been part of his revenge.

The woman he truly loved was Cheryl, her half-sister.

She couldn't bear to hear another word. Heart pounding, she turned and fled, stumbling blindly down the hallway.

But she didn't get far.

A group of girls stepped into her path.

""Well, well, look who it is. The star of the sex tape!""

""Just came out of his office—what, couldn't wait to offer yourself up again?""

Elizabeth's face turned ghostly pale. She tried to push past them, but they shoved her back and forth like a toy.

Then, suddenly, Daniel's low, icy voice cut through the chaos. ""Laying a finger on Elizabeth right in front of me? You must have a death wish.""

No one knew when Daniel had left his office, but now his tall, broad-shouldered figure was striding calmly toward them.

The girls scattered like startled birds the moment they saw him.

Daniel walked up to Elizabeth and gently smoothed her windblown hair. As he bent down and looked into her eyes, his fingers brushed lightly across her cheek.

""Didn't I tell you? If anyone messes with you again, just say my name.""

The sharp, acrid smell of tobacco assaulted Elizabeth's senses, instantly irritating her eyes and making her throat feel tight and scratchy.

The Daniel standing before her blurred with the one from her memories—the man who had protected her time and time again. It felt like a dream from another life.

Back when her mother, Julia Bennett, had taken her own life, her father, Samson Fisher, had gone back to his first love, Wanda Payne, leaving Elizabeth in a home where she wasn't quite an orphan—but it sure felt like one.

Then the rumors began to spread at school that Julia had been a mistress, and that Cheryl was the rightful daughter of the Fisher family.

As ""the mistress' daughter"", bullying became her daily reality.

It was Daniel who had pulled her out of that hell.

With nothing more than the weight of his name as a board member, he carved out a small, warm corner of the world just for her.

Just yesterday, on Daniel's birthday, the two of them had slept together, tipsy from too much wine.

That night, Daniel had shed his usual refined, aloof image and pinned her against the floor-to-ceiling window with a hunger that left her trembling from nerves and fear.

In that moment, when he took her for the first time, Elizabeth had felt like a lost bird finally finding its way home.

She had no idea that ""home"" was nothing more than a carefully laid trap.

Her mind swirled in a daze.

By the time she came back to her senses, Daniel was already leading her out of the administration building. She slid into the front passenger seat of his car without a word.

Chapter 2

As always, Daniel leaned over to buckle Elizabeth's seatbelt for her. Noticing the redness around her eyes, he spoke gently, his voice laced with reassurance.

""The video was an accident. I'll take care of it and make sure it's wiped clean. You're not in a good state today. Let me take you home so you can rest.""

Elizabeth pressed her lips together, but his earlier words echoed in her mind. Before she could stop them, tears spilled uncontrollably down her cheeks.

Daniel paused, clearly caught off guard.

He reached up to wipe her tears, then almost as if something had just occurred to him, he opened the car door.

""Wait here a second, I need to buy something.""

As the door shut behind him, Elizabeth noticed he'd left the wrong phone behind.

His phone sat in the cup holder between them. Almost without thinking, she picked it up and typed in Cheryl's birthday.

The screen unlocked instantly.

At the top of his WhatsApp chats was Cheryl's name.

In their most recent messages, Cheryl had asked him if he could cut things off with Elizabeth before she came back home.

Daniel had replied, ""She's just a toy. I was never really with her.""

Elizabeth's chest tightened painfully. Fighting back the burning in her nose, she scrolled further up.

For the past two years, while Cheryl had been abroad, Daniel had called her every single night without fail, always around 8:00 pm—the same time he always told Elizabeth he was in board meetings and couldn't be disturbed.

On top of that, he had been sending Cheryl money every month—six-figure transfers, clean and direct, with no note attached.

And Cheryl knew how to play it sweet too.

Every now and then, she'd send him selfies, asking for compliments, and Daniel would reply with cute animal stickers—ones Elizabeth had never seen before—telling her not to wear so little, to stay warm, to take care of herself.

Staring at the chat history, Elizabeth finally understood. She had never truly known Daniel at all. The kindness he'd shown her, the tenderness, the care—it was only a sliver of the love he gave to Cheryl.

Daniel returned to the car with a small box of emergency contraceptive pills.

He gently stroked Elizabeth's hair, his voice soft, careful, just like always.

""Last night was a little rushed. I didn't take the right precautions. Take this, just in case.""

Elizabeth clutched the box so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her lips were pressed together so hard that they nearly bled.

If she hadn't heard it with her own ears, she might still have believed Daniel actually cared about her.

But now, she was wide awake.

When the car pulled up in front of the villa, Daniel leaned in to kiss her goodbye like he always did. But this time, Elizabeth turned her head away and fumbled with her seatbelt.

Daniel's eyes darkened. He pulled her into his arms, holding her tight.

""Still upset about the video?"" he asked.

Elizabeth said nothing.

""I didn't film it. The hotel manager's already been fired.""

He lifted her chin with a finger, his voice low and coaxing. ""Elizabeth, I never wanted to hurt you. I never will. Our anniversary's coming up—I'll make it up to you then.""

Lies dressed as kindness cut deeper than truth ever could.

Her nose stung. She pushed him away and muttered, ""I'm going in.""

She practically ran up the steps and into the villa.

The moment she stepped through the door, she ran straight into Samson. His face twisted with rage. Before she could even open her mouth, he raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face.

""Elizabeth, I underestimated you. You want to date someone, fine. But to film some filthy, disgraceful video? You've humiliated me completely!"" he shouted.

His voice was sharp, cutting, and merciless as he continued, ""No wonder everyone at your school picks on you. It's not because they're cruel; it's because you're disgusting and shameless. You're the rot that draws the flies!""

He threw a plane ticket at her feet. ""I booked you a flight for seven days from now. Get the hell out, and don't ever come back.""

Elizabeth bent down to pick it up. Her fingers trembled, as if the thin slip of paper weighed a hundred pounds.

It felt less like a boarding pass and more like a final sentence—a declaration that the world itself had abandoned her.

Samson thought she was a disgrace and just wanted her gone.

That was fine—Elizabeth didn't want to stay, either.

""I'll go,"" she said calmly. ""And I'll do as you said. I won't come back. Ever.""

Samson froze, thinking he must have misheard her.

Back when he had arranged for Cheryl to study abroad, he'd tried to convince Elizabeth to go too. But she had refused.

After pressing her for a reason, he'd found out she was in love, head over heels, no less.

He'd assumed she would put up a fight again this time. He never expected her to agree so readily.

His anger cooled, if only just slightly. He spoke again, his voice sharp.

""Cheryl's coming back this weekend. I'm throwing a welcome party for her. You'll be there. The video's already out. If you don't show your face, the rumors will only get worse.""

Elizabeth nodded. ""Got it.""

…

She requested three days off from school.

In that time, she gathered everything Daniel had ever given her and listed them all online for resale at full price.

Three days later, Cheryl returned.

Samson hosted a lavish welcome party for her at Kaverton's biggest hotel, inviting every major name in business and high society.

And Daniel was among them.

Elizabeth hadn't expected to see him there. The moment she caught sight of him, she turned to leave. But Daniel grabbed her wrist and pulled her into a quiet hallway.

He pinned her against the wall, hands braced on either side of her, caging her in. His breath was warm against her ear as he spoke.

""You've been skipping school and not answering my messages. You didn't even say a word about our anniversary. Elizabeth, do you have any idea how worried I've been?""

Chapter 3

Daniel's eyes locked onto Elizabeth, his frustration over her disappearance simmering just beneath the surface.

Elizabeth pressed her lips together before forcing herself to meet his gaze. ""Mr. Woolridge, I didn't realize you could get so worked up over a meaningless hookup.""

The sudden sharpness in her tone, so unlike the obedient, quiet Elizabeth he was used to, caught him off guard.

Something defiant flashed in his eyes. In one swift motion, he yanked her closer, wrapping his arms around her waist in a possessive grip.

""A hookup? One time in two years, and you're calling that a hookup?"" he scoffed.

Elizabeth had no idea what had gotten into him. Before she could react, he grabbed her chin and leaned in like he was about to kiss her.

Just then, a voice interrupted them.

""Daniel, so this is where you ran off to. Cheryl's looking for you.""

Daniel frowned and loosened his hold on her. Turning to the man, he said, ""Got it. I'm on my way.""

Elizabeth tilted her head, feigning surprise. ""You know my sister?""

""Know her? Their relationship is a lot more interesting than you think,"" the guy said with a smirk. ""Brace yourself, Elizabeth. You're in for a shock.""

As the two of them walked away, a flicker of sarcasm passed through Elizabeth's eyes.

They operated under the smug assumption of her ignorance, confident that their orchestrated display of degradation would reduce her to pieces for their evening's entertainment.

What they didn't know was that she'd already pulled herself together, and she was more than ready to cut Daniel out of her life for good.

As the banquet reached its peak, the lights suddenly went out.

Moments later, a spotlight flared to life, illuminating the stage. Daniel appeared in a sleek black suit, escorting Cheryl, who was dressed in a stunning white gown, to the center of the room.

Samson beamed as he raised a hand to quiet the crowd. Then he spoke loudly and clearly, ""Thank you all for coming tonight.

""We're here not only to welcome Cheryl back from her studies abroad, but also to share some exciting news.

""The Fisher and Woolridge families have been close for generations. Years ago, we arranged an engagement between Cheryl and Daniel.

""Now that they've fallen in love, we'll be holding their engagement party at the end of the month. We hope you'll all join us to witness their happiness!""

As soon as Samson finished, Daniel's friends turned to Elizabeth, clearly waiting for her to break down.

But Elizabeth stood quietly and calmly in the crowd as if what was happening on stage had absolutely nothing to do with her.

Daniel frowned. This was the moment Elizabeth was supposed to lose control, to crumble. But instead, she was unnaturally composed. A strange irritation bubbled up inside him.

Cheryl, noticing the shift in his energy, leaned in and asked, ""Dan, what's wrong?""

Daniel quickly looked away from Elizabeth and replied smoothly, ""Nothing. Just spaced out for a second.""

But he knew better. Elizabeth had loved him. There was no way she felt nothing.

She was just putting on a brave face.

…

Elizabeth splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom, scrubbing hard.

Thinking back to how desperately she'd clung to Daniel, she felt nothing but disgust for herself.

No wonder he'd only touched her that one time in two whole years. It wasn't because he cherished her. It was because she simply wasn't worth touching.

And the night she had treasured—her first time—meant nothing to him. It was simply the perfect weapon to ruin her life completely.

When Elizabeth returned to the banquet hall, Samson called her over. ""Elizabeth, come say hello to your future brother-in-law.""

She walked up to Daniel with a perfectly measured smile. ""Hello, Daniel, my brother-in-law.""

The word hit him hard, and his expression darkened instantly.

Cheryl, completely oblivious, beamed. ""Lizzy, I just heard Dan's a board member at your school. What a small world! If you ever run into trouble, just ask him for help. We're family now, after all.""

Elizabeth clenched her jaw. ""I won't be bothering Daniel.""

She didn't even look at him, but she could feel his stare—icy and sharp, like a blade pressed to her skin.

After a few more polite exchanges, Elizabeth was about to excuse herself, but Cheryl looped an arm through hers with exaggerated warmth.

""It's been so long since we talked, Lizzy. I've got so much to catch up on with you.""

Before Elizabeth could respond, Cheryl dragged her into the lounge.

The moment the door shut behind them, Cheryl dropped the sweet act. Her smile vanished, replaced by a cold, cutting look.

""Elizabeth, I heard you slept with Daniel, and now the video's everywhere. Did you really think cheap, disgusting tricks like that would make him fall for you?

""Let me spell it out for you—he doesn't like you. In fact, he can't stand you. You know those rumors about your mom being a homewrecker? I told him to spread them.

""And about him chasing you? That was my idea. I wanted to watch you fall for him, bit by bit—just so he could be the one to destroy you.""

Chapter 4

Elizabeth asked quietly, ""Why?""

""Why? Because you don't know your place. Your mother's been dead for years, and you're still clinging to everything that belongs to the Fisher family.

""All of it should've been mine. You're the daughter of a mistress—what right do you have to enjoy the luxury and status that should've been mine?"" Cheryl scoffed.

Elizabeth could tolerate a lot, but not when someone dragged her mother through the mud.

She stormed up to Cheryl, her voice shaking with fury, every word forced through gritted teeth.

""My mother wasn't a mistress. She married my father without even knowing you or your mom existed. It was you two who drove her to her death.""

Cheryl hadn't expected Elizabeth to talk back. Her expression twisted in rage as she raised her hand to slap her.

Just then, the lounge door burst open.

From the corner of her eye, Cheryl spotted Daniel walking in and instantly switched tactics. Thinking fast, she grabbed a handful of mixed nuts from the table and shoved them into her mouth.

A second later, she collapsed to the floor, slurring her words dramatically through a mouthful of food. ""Elizabeth… why would you make me eat that? You know I'm allergic to nuts…""

Daniel rushed to her side without hesitation, shoving Elizabeth aside.

She stumbled back, hitting the edge of a nearby coffee table.

A porcelain cup shattered on the floor. Shards of glass tore into Elizabeth's palms, leaving her hands bloodied, but Daniel didn't even glance her way.

He was already kneeling beside Cheryl, wrapping her in his arms. ""Cheryl, are you okay?""

Tears welled in Cheryl's eyes as she clung weakly to his arm.

""I just wanted to catch up with Lizzy… I don't know what I said wrong. She suddenly forced me to eat those snacks… Look at me, Daniel. Am I breaking out in hives?""

Daniel looked down, and sure enough, angry red welts were rapidly blooming across Cheryl's skin.

""What do I do? The banquet isn't even over yet; I don't want to embarrass you in front of everyone. Makeup—right, I can cover it with makeup!""

Daniel gripped Cheryl's wrist tightly, his expression darkening. ""You're breaking out in hives and still worried about crap like that? Enough. I'm taking you to the hospital.""

He scooped Cheryl into his arms. Just before leaving, he shot Elizabeth a cold, scathing look.

Elizabeth forced herself to stand. Pain surged through her body with every movement. Blood poured freely from her hands, soaking her dress in seconds.

But she couldn't feel it. It was as if she'd fallen into a bottomless pit, and every ounce of sensation had drained from her body.

She called over a waiter and asked for a first aid kit, then silently tended to her wounds, her fingers trembling the entire time.

By the time she was done, her body was drained, her mind foggy. She dragged her feet toward the exit, too exhausted to think.

As soon as she stepped into the hallway, several figures lunged out of the shadows. Before she could react, they grabbed her and dragged her into a nearby storage room.

A rough hand clamped around her jaw, forcing her head up.

The next second, a burning liquid was poured straight into her mouth—pepper spray in liquid form, sharp and overwhelming.

Elizabeth's eyes flew open in horror.

Like Cheryl, she had a severe allergy, specifically to chili peppers. This much concentrated pepper could kill her.

""Mmff… stop…""

Elizabeth tried to fight back, but they didn't give her a chance. Cup after cup was forced down her throat—one after another.

She choked violently, her face flushed deep red as her body convulsed. Her wounded hands clawed weakly at the floor, the scraping sound raw and desperate.

The attackers didn't stop. If anything, her suffering only excited them further.

""Cheryl is Daniel's everything, and you dared lay a hand on her? Do you even know your place?""

""Heard you got bullied a lot at school. You probably got passed around by half the guys there. Do you think someone like Daniel—so proud and picky—would ever want a used-up whore like you?""

""Drink up, slut. Consider it your apology to Cheryl, or things are gonna get a lot worse for you.""

Elizabeth's vision blurred, her mind slipping further and further away.

With the last ounce of strength she had left, she whispered a name—barely audible. ""Dan…""

That was all she managed before cruel laughter exploded around her.

""Hah! You're still hoping Daniel's gonna come save you?""

""He's the one who told us to do this. You hurt Cheryl; he wants you dead!""

""Hey, let's rip her dress off and send him the pictures. Let Daniel blow off some steam, too!""

They swarmed her. In seconds, they tore her dress to shreds.

Then came the camera flashes, shot after shot of Elizabeth's battered, half-conscious body. Until finally, her strength gave out completely, and everything went black.

Chapter 5

When Elizabeth woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed.

Daniel sat beside her, working on his laptop. As if sensing her stir, he looked up and met her gaze.

The moment their eyes met, he let out the faintest sigh of relief, but his voice remained cold and sharp.

""How does it feel to be on the receiving end for once? Take this as a lesson. Don't mess with Cheryl again.""

Elizabeth turned her face away without a word. A single tear slid quietly down her cheek.

She used to see Daniel as her salvation. But now, after what he'd done to her… how was he any different from the people who used to bully her?

Daniel watched her in silence. For a moment, something strange stirred in his chest.

She was the one who'd gone after Cheryl out of jealousy. After everything she'd done, she deserved this.

So why did he feel guilty when he saw her cry?

Just then, a young nurse opened the door. ""Mr. Woolridge, the air conditioner in Ms. Cheryl's room just went out…""

Daniel frowned. ""Then fix it. Why are you telling me?""

""We've already called maintenance, but they won't be here for another hour. Ms. Cheryl keeps saying she's cold, and unfortunately, there aren't any spare rooms available…""

The second he heard that, Daniel stood up. ""What kind of hospital takes an hour to fix an air conditioner?""

His brows drew tight. ""Cheryl's always had a weak constitution. She can't handle the cold. Move Elizabeth and let Cheryl have her room instead.""

The nurse hesitated, glancing uneasily at Elizabeth lying in the bed.

Elizabeth had a severe allergy to chili peppers. After being force-fed so much of it, the fact that she was still alive was a miracle.

But the damage was done. Her esophagus and stomach lining were badly burned. Even the slightest irritation could put her in danger all over again.

Meanwhile, Cheryl had only eaten a single bite of a nut-filled dessert. A few allergy shots and she was already on the mend.

And yet, everything Elizabeth had suffered didn't seem to matter at all to Daniel.

""What are you waiting for? If Cheryl catches a cold in this dump, your entire hospital's going under,"" he snapped.

The message was clear. The nurse had no choice but to obey.

Soon enough, Elizabeth was moved to Cheryl's vacated room.

Daniel stayed with Cheryl. Elizabeth was left alone, lying in the oversized hospital bed, staring at the ceiling in a daze.

As the memories of everything she'd endured replayed in her mind, the dam finally broke. Tears spilled silently down her cheeks.

Then came the cold. A deep, creeping chill wrapped around her like a shroud.

She glanced toward the source and froze. The air conditioner was on, blasting icy air at full power.

In that instant, it all clicked.

Cheryl had lied about the air conditioner being broken. It wasn't about escaping the cold—it was about creating it.

She wanted Elizabeth to move here—to remain sick, weak, freezing. It was just another twisted form of revenge.

The temperature kept dropping. The air sliced into her skin like invisible knives. She trembled so hard her teeth chattered.

She tried to call for help, but her throat was too swollen. No sound came out.

She reached for the call button, but her arm was too weak. It barely lifted an inch before falling limply back to the bed.

Elizabeth curled into herself, clinging to whatever warmth she had left. She felt completely hopeless.

She didn't know how long she lay there—abandoned, freezing, and slowly slipping away—before someone finally came.

When she forced her swollen eyes open, the face that greeted her wasn't one of concern. It was Cheryl, standing at her bedside, smirking with sick amusement.

""Elizabeth, look at you. You're pathetic. You look like a stray dog,"" she sneered. ""Daniel did all this just to help me vent. By now, everyone would have seen your pictures—they're passing them around for laughs.

""Oh, and guess what? Some adult film companies reached out earlier. Said you'd be perfect for the lead in their next shoot. Isn't that hilarious?

Cheryl laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world.

Then, just as suddenly, her smile vanished. She grabbed Elizabeth's arm, right where the wounds were worst, and dug her fingers in.

Blood spurted instantly. Elizabeth's vision blackened from the pain.

""Now, do you finally understand who he loves? Be smart. Admit your mom was a homewrecker and disappear. I don't ever want to see your disgusting face again. You make me sick,"" Cheryl hissed.

The light in Elizabeth's eyes dimmed, fading into a hollow, lifeless emptiness.

Disappear?

She would.

Soon, she'd be leaving for a faraway country, and she would never look back.

# Best Custom Espresso Cups 2025: create Your Perfect Brew

Espresso, that concentrated shot of coffee, is more than just a drink; it's an experience, a ritual, a moment of indulgence. The quality of your espresso machine and beans are crucial, but the vessel from which you savor it plays a meaningful role.That's where custom espresso cups come in. More than just containers, they are an extension of your personal style and a way to elevate your coffee experience.

This guide explores the best options available, helping you craft the perfect brew, right down to the cup.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a custom espresso cup extends beyond its aesthetics. Materials, construction, and design features all contribute to the enjoyment and longevity of your daily ritual.**Durable Material:** The choice of material substantially impacts the cup's ability to retain heat and withstand daily use.

High-quality custom espresso cups are often crafted from porcelain, ceramic, or double-walled glass. Porcelain and ceramic offer excellent heat retention, keeping your espresso warm for longer. double-walled glass provides insulation while showcasing the rich color and crema of your espresso. The specific composition of the ceramic, such as bone china or stoneware, can further enhance its durability and resistance to chipping.

**Ergonomic Design:** The cup's shape and handle design influence its comfort and ease of use.

A well-designed espresso cup should feel balanced and agreeable in your hand.Features like a slightly flared rim can enhance the drinking experience by guiding the flow of liquid. A comfortable handle, whether a classic looped design or a modern minimalist form, ensures a secure grip and prevents burns. The overall size and weight of the cup should be proportional to the standard espresso shot size (around 1-2 ounces).

**Customization Options:** The ability to personalize the cup with designs,text,or logos allows for a truly unique piece.Customization options are at the heart of the custom espresso cup trend. These can range from simple monograms and initials to intricate artwork and company logos. The printing method used, such as screen printing, sublimation, or laser engraving, affects the durability and vibrancy of the design. The platform or service offering the customization should provide a user-friendly interface for creating and visualizing your desired design.

**Heat Retention:** The cup's ability to maintain the espresso's temperature is crucial for optimal flavor and enjoyment.

The thermal properties of the material and the design of the cup play a significant role in heat retention. Thicker-walled cups, particularly those made of porcelain or ceramic, tend to retain heat better than thinner glass cups.Double-walled glass cups offer superior insulation, creating an air gap that minimizes heat transfer. Many custom espresso cups are designed with a slightly tapered shape to further minimize heat loss from the surface.

**Size and Capacity:** The cup's volume should be appropriate for a standard espresso shot, allowing room for crema without overflowing.

The ideal size for a custom espresso cup typically ranges from 2 to 3 ounces (60 to 90 milliliters). This capacity provides sufficient space for a double shot of espresso and a generous layer of crema. Overly large cups can lead to rapid cooling and diluted flavor, while undersized cups risk spillage. The internal dimensions of the cup should also be considered to ensure that the crema forms properly.**Dishwasher and Microwave Safe:** Practical considerations such as ease of cleaning and reheating contribute to the overall user experience.

Look for custom espresso cups that are explicitly labeled as dishwasher-safe for convenient cleaning. The manufacturing process and materials used should be resistant to the harsh detergents and high temperatures of dishwashers. Microwave-safe cups allow you to quickly reheat cooled espresso without damaging the cup or design. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific care guidelines.

# Best Derby Cake Recipe in 2025: Easy & Flavorful!

The Derby Cake is a rich, decadent dessert deeply associated with the Kentucky Derby. It's a chocolate cake packed with nuts, chocolate chips, and bourbon, reflecting the traditions and flavors of the region. Finding the perfect recipe can be a quest, and with so many variations available, identifying the ""best"" one requires considerations of ease of preparation, flavor complexity, and overall appeal. This review examines a standout Derby Cake recipe that strikes a balance between being easy to follow and delivering an intensely delicious final product, making it a contender for the best Derby Cake of 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The standout Derby Cake recipe under review incorporates several key features that contribute to its exceptional taste and ease of execution.

**Unsalted Butter & Vegetable Shortening Base:** This recipe calls for a combination of unsalted butter and vegetable shortening. The butter provides rich flavor, while the shortening ensures a tender crumb and moist texture.

The precise ratio of butter to shortening is crucial for achieving the perfect balance between flavor and texture. The unsalted butter avoids adding excess salt,allowing the other flavors to shine. Vegetable shortening stabilizes the structure of the cake.

**Bourbon Infusion:** True to Derby Cake tradition, this recipe generously incorporates bourbon. The bourbon is added directly to the cake batter and, optionally, to a glaze to enhance the flavor.

The suggested bourbon is a medium-bodied Kentucky straight bourbon, providing a perfect complement to the chocolate, nuts, and spices in the cake. The use of bourbon adds a touch of Kentucky heritage and elevates the dessert.

**Bittersweet Chocolate & Chocolate Chips:** This recipe utilizes both bittersweet chocolate and chocolate chips. The bittersweet chocolate contributes to a deeper, more complex chocolate flavor, while the chocolate chips add pockets of gooey sweetness.

The quality of the chocolate used is crucial. High-quality bittersweet chocolate with a cacao percentage of around 60-70% will provide the best flavor depth. Chocolate chips with a mix of milk and dark chocolate create a balance of flavors.**Walnuts & Pecans:** A signature of Derby cake is the inclusion of nuts, typically walnuts and pecans. This recipe uses both, adding a textural element and nutty flavor that perfectly complements the other ingredients.

the nuts are lightly toasted before being added to the batter to enhance thier flavor and aroma. A combination of walnuts and pecans adds a variety of textures and complementary flavors to the cake.## Core Benefits

This standout Derby Cake recipe offers several core benefits that make it a compelling choice for both novice and experienced bakers.

**Simplicity and Ease of Preparation:** The recipe is designed to be straightforward and easy to follow. Clear instructions and readily available ingredients simplify the baking process, even for those with limited baking experiance. All the steps are well explained, removing any possible ambiguity and minimizing the chances of error.

**Exceptional Flavor and Texture:** Balance of nutty, chocolatey, and bourbon flavors creates a culinary sensation. Tender, moist crumb further enhances the overall taste and experience. The use of high-quality ingredients results in a deeply satisfying and flavorful cake.**Versatility & Adaptability:** While adhering to the traditional Derby Cake components, this recipe allows for minor adaptations to suit personal preferences. The amount of bourbon can be adjusted, different types of nuts can be substituted, or a different glaze can be used. This flexibility enables bakers to customize the cake to their specific tastes.

## FAQs Section

**can I make this Derby Cake recipe without bourbon?**
Yes, although bourbon is a key component of the traditional flavor, it can be omitted. Substitute it with an equal amount of apple juice or strong brewed coffee for a similar liquid content and depth of flavor.

**Can I use a different type of nut other than walnuts and pecans?**
Certainly. While walnuts and pecans are standard in Derby Cake, you can substitute them with other nuts like almonds or hazelnuts. Be sure to lightly toast them before adding them to the batter to maximize their flavor.

**How should I store the Derby Cake?**
The Derby Cake can be stored at room temperature for up to three days or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Make sure to wrap it tightly to prevent it from drying out. It can also be frozen for longer storage; simply thaw before serving.

## Competitor Comparison

### Product Comparison Overview

Here's a comparison with two alternative Derby Cake recipes demonstrating different approaches.

#### Standout Derby Cake

* **Base:** Balanced blend of butter and shortening for optimal flavor and texture.

* **Bourbon:** Generous amount infused directly into the batter and optional glaze.

* **Chocolate:** Uses both bittersweet chocolate and chocolate chips.

#### Competitor 1: All-Butter Derby Cake

* **Base:** Employs only butter for a richer, but sometimes heavier, texture.

* **Bourbon:** Limited bourbon quantity, primarily for glaze.

* **Chocolate:** solely uses chocolate chips and cocoa powder.

#### Competitor 2: Boxed Cake Mix ""Derby"" Cake

* **Base:** Starts with boxed cake mix to accelerate the process.

* **Bourbon:** Contains minimal bourbon flavor or none at all.

* **Chocolate:** Uses primarily cocoa powder.

### Key Differences Summary

The Standout Derby Cake excels in achieving a balanced texture and flavor profile while providing simplicity in its preparation. The All-Butter Cake offers a richer taste but can be challenging to achieve the ideal cake texture without the stabilizing effect of shortening. The Boxed Cake Mix version provides speed and convenience, but typically sacrifices flavor and texture complexity found in scratch recipes. The Standout Derby Cake offers a notable advantage in flavor, texture, and the experience of making an authentic dessert.## Ideal User Profile

I said (calmly at first), “Not really in the mood for beauty tips while Mom’s hooked up to machines.”

# The Special Hell of Holding On When You Should Let Go

You know that feeling when you’re [checking their social media at 2 PM](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), then again at 2:03, then convincing yourself that liking their friend’s post might [somehow send a cosmic signal](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)? When you’re analyzing their every move for hidden meanings while [they’re probably not thinking about you](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) at all?

I lived in that space for eight months. The space between [hope and delusion](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), where every spiritual practice becomes a [manipulation tool and every synchronicity ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)gets twisted into evidence that they’re coming back.

You’re not crazy. You’re not weak. You’re not [“low vibrational”](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) for struggling to let go. You’re human, and [you’re in love with someone who isn’t showing up for that love](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). The most spiritually aware people I know have been exactly where you are — [clutching their phone like a prayer](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), refreshing [conversations that ended months ago](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), and feeling ashamed for not being [“evolved” enough](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) to just move on.

The 2025 Leo Portal is [especially powerful](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) because it coincides with [major planetary shifts](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) that amplify [truth-telling energy.](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) Unlike previous years, this Leo energy [brings an unprecedented clarity](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) that cuts through [illusion faster](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) than ever before.

# My Personal Journey: Eight Months of Beautiful Delusion

Let me [paint you a picture](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) of how pathetic I’d become.

**My Daily Routine:** 

* Successful [marketing professional](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) by day 
* Analyzing his [Spotify activity during lunch breaks](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* Screenshot his [Instagram posts and zoom](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) in for clues 
* Convinced [myself his sunset photos](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) meant he missed our getaways

**The Spiritual Twist:** 

I’m an astrology enthusiast. I was literally reading both our charts daily, looking for [cosmic confirmation we were “meant to be.”](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

Every Venus transit = [“reunion energy”](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) or Every new moon = [“manifestation time”](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), Using spiritual tools to feed [my addiction to unavailable love](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

**The Rock Bottom Moment:**

I was sitting in my car after driving past his [favourite coffee shop](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). Again. His [horoscope app notification](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) popped up on my phone.

Yes, I’d subscribed to his daily horoscope. Judge me — I was judging myself plenty.

The reading said “[releasing what no longer serves you](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)” and I lost it. Not because it was profound. Because I realized I’d been getting [the same message for months](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) and ignoring it completely.

**The Night Everything Changed:**

That night, I did something radical. I opened the [emotional wellness app](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) that I had been following. Pulled [both our birth charts](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). Asked a different question.

Instead of: “[When will he come back?](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)”, I asked: “[Why isn’t this working?](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)”

**What I Found Shattered My Fantasy:**

* Our [Venus signs](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) were completely incompatible 
* His [Mars opposed my Moon](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* Our [composite chart showed karmic completion](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), not soulmate connection 
* Every [astrological indicator](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) I’d been ignoring suddenly made sense

I’d been trying to force [two puzzle pieces together](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) that were never meant to fit. Calling it “divine love” when it was actually “divine lesson.”

>“I wasn’t reading the stars. I was rewriting them to match my delusions.”

The next Leo Portal was approaching. Something [deep in my soul](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) knew this was my last chance to face [the truth before it consumed](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) me completely.

# The 5 Astrological Signs Your Ex Isn’t Coming Back

Understanding [**astrological compatibility**](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) and [**Venus retrograde vs Leo Portal energy**](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) helps reveal when to let go. Here are the cosmic indicators I finally learned to recognize:

**1. Your Body Rejects Their Energy** 

* Nausea when [typing their name](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) in your phone 
* Panic attacks [triggered by their favourite songs ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* Exhaustion so deep you [sleep 12 hours and wake up drained](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) 
* Hands [literally shaking when reaching for your phone](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) to text them

**2. Oracle Cards Keep Showing Endings** 

 Every reading points to [“release” and “new beginnings”](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). Messages about [self-love instead of reunion](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). Your intuition fights the cards [because you don’t want to hear it](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). 

**3. The Astrology Doesn’t Lie** 

* Venus signs [completely incompatible](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) 
* [Mars and Moon aspects](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) create constant conflict 
* Composite chart [shows lesson completion](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), not lasting love 
* Their [North Node path leads away from you](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), not toward you

**4. Synchronicities Shift Direction** 

* Stop seeing [their name everywhere](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) 
* Angel numbers change from [reunion codes](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) (222, 717) to [self-love messages](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) (444, 1111) 
* [Happy couples everywhere](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) while you feel empty inside 
* [Their horoscope contradicts](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) everything you want to hear

**5. The Universe Intervenes Physically** 

* Technology [“glitches” when you try to contact them ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* You [“accidentally” delete their number ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* [Social media algorithms](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) stop showing their posts 
* [Physical obstacles prevent you](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) from reaching out

# How Astrology Became My Reality Check (Not My Fantasy Fuel)

This year’s Leo Portal [energy is different](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). It doesn’t [coddle you or speak in whispers](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb).

It’s the universe saying: **“**[**Enough. Time for truth**](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)**.”**

Leo energy [demands authenticity](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). I’d been living a lie for eight months. [Using astrology to enable my fantasy](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) instead of [illuminate my reality](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb).

**Understanding Venus Retrograde vs Leo Portal Energy:**

**Venus Retrograde:** 

* Often brings [exes back temporarily](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) for closure 
* Creates [confusion and mixed signals ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* [Tests your boundaries and growth ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* Usually [temporary situations](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

**Leo Portal Energy:**

 • About [authentic heart alignment and Demands](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) truth over comfort 

* Forces you to [choose self-respect ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* Creates [permanent shifts in consciousness](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

The 2025 Lion’s Gate coincides with [powerful truth-revealing transits](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). This makes denial impossible.

**The Astrological Wake-Up Call:**

During the Leo Portal, [I did something radical](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). Booked a s[ynastry reading with an astrologer](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) who didn’t know our story. I wanted [raw truth, not confirmation bias.](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

Her words still echo: *“This connection was* [*meant to teach you about self-worth*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*, not secure you a relationship. His* [*North Node indicates he needs independence*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*. Yours shows you need to* [*learn not to lose yourself in others*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*. You’re both* [*exactly where you need to be — apart*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*.”*

She wasn’t cruel. [She was compassionate but clear](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb).

**The Reality:** The stars weren’t [conspiring to bring us together](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). They were [conspiring to help us both grow](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) in different directions.

**Why Leo Portal Energy Cuts Through Illusion:**

* Leo rules the heart and [demands honest self-expression ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
* Your [soul literally cannot sustain lies](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) during this portal
*  Like [cosmic truth serum combined with spiritual intervention](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) 
* Forces [authentic alignment over comfortable delusion](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

>“Leo Portal [doesn’t bring back your ex](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb). It brings [back your self-respect](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb).”

# How to Use Astrology for Breakup Healing: Step-by-Step Guide

# Understanding Your Venus-Mars Dynamic

**My Process:**

 • Studied [both our Venus signs](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) and their compatibility 

* Looked at [Mars signs to understand](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) our conflict styles

**Daily Practice I Used:** 

* **Day 1–2:** [Meditation asking for clarity](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) about the relationship

* **Day 7–8:** Setting intentions for [authentic love that honors my worth](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

# Birth Chart Self-Therapy for Astrological Compatibility

**Questions That Cut Through Fantasy:** 

* What does my 7th house really say [about partnership needs](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)? 
* How do my [Chiron placements show up](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) in this relationship? 
* What is my [North Node calling me toward](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)? Does this person support that? 
* Where is [my Venus?](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) Am I [honoring what truly makes me feel loved? ](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

**The Chart Reading That Changed Everything:**

My astrologer pointed out something devastating:

*“Your* [*Venus in Virgo needs consistency*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) *and practical demonstrations of love. His* [*Venus in Gemini thrives on variety and mental stimulation*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*. You’re trying to love* [*him in Virgo*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*, but he* [*needs Gemini love*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*. He’s giving you* [*Gemini love when you need Virgo love.*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) *Neither of you is wrong —* [*you’re just incompatible*](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)*.”*

>“Astrology doesn’t judge your love. It just shows you whether it can actually work.”

# The Transformation: From Desperate to Empowered

Six months after that [Leo Portal revelation](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), everything changed. Not because [I manifested him back — because I manifested myself back](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb).

**What Actually Shifted:** 

* Stopped checking his social media → Started checking in with myself 
* Began attracting people whose [Venus signs actually complemented mine](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)
*  My confidence [returned when I stopped seeking validation](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) from someone incapable of giving it 
* Learned to [trust cosmic timing](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) instead of trying to manipulate it

**The Plot Twist Nobody Warns You About:**

He did eventually reach out. [A random “thinking of you” text six months later.](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

Instead of excitement, [I felt… empty. Not angry, not hurt. Just genuinely indifferent.](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb)

I realized I’d been [grieving the loss of my fantasy](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb), not the loss of him.

I didn’t respond. Not out of spite, but [because the person who sent that text felt like a stranger](https://app.coto.world/Z8hhYz1FrVb) to the woman I’d become.

1mdvgy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mdvgy2/how_i_burned_40000_building_the_wrong_saas_and/,"How I Burned $40,000 Building the Wrong SaaS (And What Finally Got Me to $10k MRR)","**The “genius idea” that wasn’t**

In 2022, I thought I had found *the* SaaS goldmine.

A friend vented to me over coffee about how clunky their agency’s project reporting process was. They were spending hours each week cobbling together screenshots from different platforms (Google Analytics, Meta Ads, Slack convos) into Google Slides for clients.

*“What if I built a dashboard that auto-generated these reports?”*

Cue three months of excitement. I wireframed like crazy, hired a part-time dev, and invested in fancy UI. I was sure agencies would *throw* money at this.

Fast-forward 6 months later:  
**$40,813 spent**.  
**178 cold emails sent.**  
**12 product demos.**  
**3 paying customers.**

I was bleeding money. And worse: *no one really cared about the problem I was solving.*

**Where I went wrong (a post-mortem)**

Here’s what I learned, the hard way:

* **I built for one person, not a market.** Just because my friend had a problem didn’t mean thousands of agencies were desperate for the same solution.
* **I obsessed over UI, not UX.** The tool looked beautiful. But onboarding sucked. Integrations were buggy. The wow moment came *too late*, if ever.
* **I skipped pre-sales validation.** I didn’t ask the hard questions:“Would you *pay* for this?” “What are you doing today instead?” “What’s your #1 bottleneck in reporting?”

I assumed interest = purchase. It doesn’t.

**Pivoting to what actually worked**

Out of frustration, I paused everything.

I booked 20 calls with agency owners (people I found on IndieHackers, LinkedIn, and cold outreach). I asked only *one thing*:  
**“What’s something you do every week that you wish was automated?”**

Here’s what I kept hearing:

* “Chasing clients for approvals.”
* “Collecting creative assets.”
* “Getting clients to send feedback on designs.”

Lightbulb. 

I spent 3 days building a Notion doc with an embedded Typeform + Zapier. It auto-requested assets via email, logged responses, and pinged Slack.

Ugly. Hacky. No code.  
But people *used it.*

I posted a Loom walkthrough and got 9 beta testers.

**The slow climb to $10k MRR**

Instead of a grand “launch,” I treated it like a service first.

**Here’s how I iterated:**

* **Month 1-2:** Built a very basic MVP (just file upload + status tracking + reminders).
* **Month 3:** Added Trello/Slack integration based on feedback.
* **Month 4:** Switched from Airtable to Supabase to scale better.
* **Month 5:** Added Stripe and charged $29/mo. Got 17 paying users.
* **Month 8:** Hit 100 customers. Raised prices to $49.

**Current MRR: $10.6k. No team. No funding.**

Tools I used:

* Supabase
* Next.js
* [Clerk.dev](http://Clerk.dev) for auth
* Postmark for emails
* Stripe
* Mixpanel for analytics

**What changed the game**

* **Solve a problem people** ***already*** **pay to solve manually.** In my case, agencies already hired interns or used 5 tools to chase assets. I just replaced 3 tools and 1 part-timer with my SaaS.
* **Sell the workflow, not the features.** Most users didn’t care about “file versioning” or “custom roles.” They cared about *not emailing clients 4 times a week*.
* **Build the ugly version first.** My no-code Frankenstein solution validated the workflow before a single line of production code.
* **Talk to users. Not for validation — for** ***language*****.** The words they use → become your landing page copy.

**If you’re stuck, ask yourself:**

* Are you solving a *$10/week* problem or a *$1000/month* one?
* Are people already solving this problem manually (with duct tape)?
* Have you *watched* users go through your onboarding?
* Would anyone *miss* your tool if it disappeared tomorrow?

1mdvfx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CMFTech/comments/1mdvfx7/battery_anxiety/,Battery anxiety,"This is my ""modern""-ish phone in a long time.

I came from Xperia Z5 Premium (yes the infamous SD 810) from late 2015 to early 2022. Changed the battery for 3 times until I deem it not worth to repair anymore. Then I swapped my sim to Vivo y20s (100 USD), which is my company phone til I get my pre-ordered P2P. 

I'm not sure how much SoT a modern phone is supposed to have. I've seen posts ranging from 5-6 hours to 7-8 hours in a single charge. My SoT is usually from 4-5 hours but sometimes it's just 3-4 hours. I always charge to 90% from 20-35%-ish, depending on charger availability and the time I charge from the previous day (trying to maintain a 24 hours charge time).

Currently, I'm using Anker 33w charger. It usually charges rapidly around 25% for 15 minutes. So it's like under 45 minutes to 90%. Sometimes, the battery app indicates 55+ minutes to 1+ hour to full charge and I am perplexed by it. How can a fast charger be this inconsistent? 

Back to phone usage. Screen brightness is always below 20% and I spend most of my time indoors. For settings-wise, WiFi, hotspot, BT, location & adaptive battery are ON 24/7. No AoD. Digital wellbeing has bedtime mode set from 00:00 to 7:00. Most apps have their background usage disabled, except email and WhatsApp. App usage are as follows:

FB - 1 hr/day
Lazada (SEA shopping app, play some light, mini games to earn credits) - 1 hr/day
Shopee (another shopping app) - 0.5 hr/day
Reddit - sub 20 mins/day
WhatsApp - sub 15 mins/day
Google search/Threads - sub 3 mins/day
Camera/Chrome/Coffee app - sub 2 mins/day
Insta/Payment/Parking apps - sub 1 min/day
Average SoT for this week - 4+ hours

Yesterday, I even tried placing my phone on the table before I went to bed, just in case my movements during sleep will make the optical fingerprint sensor circle light thingy waking up. Tried to remove that factor, but still, my battery dropped by 7% doing nothing for 5 hours (yes, I had a bad sleep this morning). Previously it was just a 2% drop. Any ideas on what's happening? Did I missed out any info? 

For a phone in 2025 with 5000 mAh battery, low powered CPU (correct me if I'm wrong), I felt it quite underwhelming. Considered I don't game that much, no doom scrolling, barely watched any YouTube at all, but I've seen posts with 2-4 hours BGMI and 4 hours+ YouTube time, I wonder if my battery is faulty or CMF's QC is just meh... 

Yes this is just a $250 phone, we are a small company, our parts are gonna be more expensive than other big companies. STOP CRYING BRO 😭 

TL;DR - battery feels meh 😕, anyway to help improve it? ",1,1753948141.0,CMFTech,1,1.0,False
1mdvfm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mdvfm9/beauty_and_the_beta/,Beauty And The Beta,"# Chapter 1 Bailey

I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can. I should go to the packhouse to go and wish our pack's upcoming Alpha a happy birthday. The bane of my life. My brother’s best friend. One day to be Alpha Miles. Today he will turn 17, and meet his Alpha wolf. In all honesty, he was egotistical enough, thinking the world revolved around him, without him adding to that by finally gaining his wolf. Not your run-of-the-mill werewolf either. Oh no, Miles Davenport was destined to be an Alpha, so he would have a strong and powerful Alpha wolf, only adding to his arrogance and strength.

The crazy thing is, Miles had once upon a time been one of my closet friends too. In my younger childhood... Friends, that kind of thing comes when your father is the Beta to the Alpha. The children spend a lot of time together, and become friends. My older brother, Jordan, became the wing-man to Miles. His closest friend and ally, who as his Beta when the time came, was only right. But as the years went on, the friendship between Miles and I changed.

Friendship faded as he grew into a more popular sports star of our school. At the end of the day, he was always going to be popular, he was the upcoming Alpha after all, but as one of the top sports stars too, he was idolized. As was my brother. All the girls in school flocked around them like they were pop stars or something, and it was bizarre. I was nothing more to him now but a source of amusement for him and his sports buddies. A geek. Not one of the beauty queens who followed him around. Simply someone to make fun of.

I had gone from enjoying time with my one-day Alpha, to hating him, in the space of a school year. He thought he was god’s gift, and in all honesty, if he was, he is a gift I would return…

“Bailey!” I heard my Mum call from downstairs, telling me I was definitely running it close now for time. I know Jordan had already headed over to the packhouse a while ago with my Dad to meet his friend and our Alpha.

“I know.” I yelled back, looking at the books on my desk, desperate to continue with the assignment I was working on. I would so much rather continue working on the assignment and gain the additional credit available, work toward going to the college I want to go to instead of going to a party for the big-headed bully, I got to consider almost family, considering he was the son of my Dad’s best friend.

I stood from my seat, and walked to my mirror, adjusting my black skater dress I had chosen to wear today. Something plain and simple, easy to blend into the background, but a dress all the same if anyone asked why I hadn’t made an effort. Along with my chunky black sandals, I looked presentable, not that anyone would be looking at me. Today, all eyes would be on the birthday boy, as they always were. He would make sure of that. I flicked back my curly brown hair, before I walked out of the door, already dreading the hours that lay ahead…

My Mum pulled the car into the parking spaces outside the packhouse, while my younger sister Morgan was flicking at the curls around my head, simply trying to irritate me. She knew I would rather be anywhere but here right now, and was loving every last moment of it. “Aww, you want to go home Bailey-boo?” she teased.

“Stop you two, come on, your Dad is waiting inside. Let us go and find the birthday boy.” Mum says, sounding cheerful, completely oblivious to the fact how horrendous this party had the potential to be. She, too, worshiped Miles. Having seen him grow up alongside my brother, she seemed to think the sun shone out of his rear-end. It had always driven me insane.

“He won’t even notice us there.” I muttered under my breath as I followed her up the steps of the back house, shaking my head at my sister and how overdressed she looked. She definitely looked like she was out to impress someone today. A small part of me wondered if she hoped she might be the fated mate of Miles. After all, he was meeting his Alpha wolf today. He will have shifted for the first time today, and today could potentially be the day he can sense his fated mate out there waiting for him! There had been so much buzz around school about this, so many of the girls were excited about the potential possibility they could be his fated mate. The one chosen for him by the moon goddess. The one destined to be with him. So many of them are desperate for it to be them. While there I was desperate for anything but. I could think of nothing worse! Yet, looking at the amount of effort my younger sister had made today, I am beginning to think she was one of the many she-wolves that was holding out that hope…

We walked through the corridors of the packhouse, and it was filled with various pack members. Today was a day of celebration within pack, the birthday of the upcoming Alpha. And not just any birthday, the day he came of age. The day he met his Alpha wolf. The walls of the packhouse were adorned with decorations, music was blaring from various speakers dotted around the multiple rooms.

“Ooff, sorry!” a giggling she-wolf said to me as she nearly knocked me off my feet as she knocked into me. I would rather be anywhere but here right now. This was far too hectic and far too loud for me. I simply glare at the back of the girl as she moves away from me, not a care in the world.

I followed my Mum and my sister, who was almost skipping as she walked, toward the main lounge area. I can only assume my Mum had mindlinked my Dad to let him know we had arrived, and he said they were there, or else we could spend all day looking around for them! It appeared almost every member of the pack had turned up to celebrate the birthday of Miles fucking Davenport.

The lounge area was laden with people, music truly blasting, and everyone seeming to have a good time. Everyone but me. I caught the eye of my brother, leaning against the wall of the lounge, the furthest away from the door we had just walked into. He nodded in my direction before simply turning away.

‘Could have made an effort, Bailey.’ he mindlinked. ‘It is a birthday, not a funeral, you know?’

I felt my heart sink at his words. Great, the insults were starting already, which meant it would only be a matter of time until Miles started too. The two of them seemed to like working together like that. Finding great enjoyment in harassing me. I was only a year younger than both of them, and had desperately hoped the name-calling and insulting would ease off as they got a little older, but if anything, they seemed to get worse. All because I wasn’t like the girls they were interested in, I was sure of it. I wasn’t like the other girls. Made myself an easy target, my Mum told me, all because I enjoyed studying. Liked reading and learning. Said, I only made it harder for myself. The plan was to make it easier for myself by finding a way out…

“Jordan says your dress looks like you are going to a funeral, Bailey.” Morgan teased, fluffing up my curls again. My long brown hair fell in thick, unruly curls down my back. They drove me mad at times. Especially when my brother and sister decide to mess with them.

“Oh well, I wore a dress, like you asked.” I snapped, moving away from them, feeling angry already, so tempted just to turn around and walk home, only to be pulled back by my Mum.

“We are going to wish Miles a happy birthday. You will stay for a while at least. I do not need to be explaining to your Aunt and Uncle yet again why you have walked out on a social event, Bailey.” Mum warned me, her tone sounding grumpy, I swear she had to have read my thoughts on leaving the party already. I am sure she hated having me as a daughter, likely wishing for one that was more sociable, and one that enjoyed being a part of everything, instead of one that would rather have her head in a book.

“Awww, Happy Birthday, Miles!” I heard my sister squeal from by my side. I swear she spoke at a pitch so high only dogs could hear. Goddess knows why she is so excited. It is only his birthday. He likely doesn’t even care, he never normally does…

As I looked up, his blue eyes were locked on me, I raised my gaze to meet his, and could see his eyes shift to a darker blue… was that his wolf? I see a snarl across his face as he suddenly storms from the room. What the hell was that about?

‘Get out here.’ Miles is suddenly mindlinking me, and I have to say he sounded far from impressed. That, combined with the angry expression on his face, told me something was off. Would he have rather I had not come? Well, he was not the only one…

‘What?’ I questioned, completely confused. Was he annoyed over how I had dressed too? Jeez, it was just a dress. Does it really matter? I would go home if it was.

‘Outside now.’ He demanded once more, sounding even more irritated this time, making me realize I had little choice but to follow his orders, so I snuck away from the ongoing party back to the doors of the packhouse.

Only to find Miles pacing along the bottom of the steps, looking a mixture of confused and angry. So why did he need me here? Someone to take his anger out on? I was not willing to be that, I was sure about that… Just as I was about to walk away, he looked up.

“Fucking took you long enough.” He snapped.

I frowned, unsure what this was all about, but it was making no sense to me as I looked down toward him from where I stood at the top of the packhouse steps. His blue eyes shifted to the dark blue once more, like they had inside, taking me by surprise. His wolf is clearly lingering…

“What is wrong, Miles? Do you want me to get Jordan?” I asked.

“No I do not! I do not want anyone knowing this.” He snarls, a growl slipping from his lips, though whether that was aimed at me or whether his wolf was angry at him, I do not know…

“I don’t think I understand…” I began.

“You soon will.” He sneers, and I simply look to him in confusion. Nothing he says makes sense to me. Until he continues. “Only today did I realize. The thought makes me sick. Why our own moon goddess would play a trick like this on me, I don’t know. I am an Alpha. A fucking Alpha. I deserve a strong mate. A beautiful mate to be proud of. Not some feeble pathetic wallflower.”

My body trembles at his words. No. I had yet to gain my wolf. I did not know this yet. Why… Why him of all people? “I am your fated mate?” I question with a shaky voice. “Are you sure?”

“Are you fucking doubting me?” he yells. “And you won’t be. The moment you have your wolf, I will decide when the time is right to reject you.”

My heart twists and contorts at the thought. Rejection was meant to be the most painful thing possible. Why would he want to reject the mate chosen for him by our own moon goddess? Am I truly so repulsive?

# Chapter 2 Bailey

A Year Later

Yet another birthday party for our beloved upcoming Alpha. Ha. Not my beloved upcoming Alpha. I hated the fucker. Breaking my heart without a second thought. What I had done to deserve that I had never got a proper explanation from him. Other than the frequent insults, of why would he want to be with someone like me? Did I look like Luna material to him? I had no clue. What the hell did Luna material look like in his eyes? Some blond bimbo, no doubt. They were the she-wolves he tended to spend his time with within our pack. The ones who worshiped the ground he walked on. That would do anything he asked of them. Ones that I highly doubted read much more than the work set of them at school.

“Bailey!” my Mum yelled at me from the stairway of our family home. “Will you hurry up?!”

“Do I really need to come to the party?” I responded. “I am telling you, Miles will not be bothered if I am not there!”

“Your Aunt and Uncle will be though. And I am not explaining to them again why you are missing.” My Mum continues yelling. “Do you not realize just how many events you have missed this year, all because you have your head in a book?”

“Yeah Bai-Bai. Such a geek. No wonder you have no friends.” My sister Morgan giggles from outside my bedroom door.

“Piss off.” I hissed. “I have friends.”

I stormed from my room, and down the stairs toward my waiting family. I planned to greet the birthday boy, not that he would care in the slightest. I know that he would rather not see me at all. And then I would sneak home.

“Ew, are you wearing that?” Morgan asked.

I looked down at the skinny black trousers I had on and the white tank top. Great. I can’t win. Nothing I wear is approved of by my sister, evidently named the fashion queen without my knowledge. Oh well, I am dressed and wearing it. I think it looked good with my chunky black sandals I had on…

I scowled at my sister and walked out of the door. “Are we going or not?” I snapped at them all, truly not able to wait for the following month when I leave to go to university. Get away from them, and this pack!

The party was well underway when we arrived, music pounding from the speakers as couples made out in every available space, so I averted my eyes as we walked through the corridors of the packhouse to the lounge where we would no doubt find Miles reigning over his people. Being all important, like he was partial to considering himself.

‘Why are you here?’ Miles’s voice filled my mindlink, before I had even fully entered the room behind my parents.

Great. ‘I didn’t get a choice. Trust me, I would rather not be.’ I snapped back.

I was getting more than a little tired of the way he would treat me. Yes, he planned on rejecting me. Decided I was not for him, but he could have left it at that. I didn’t need treating like I was some sort of social pariah because of the fact he decided I was not right for him. I do not think I deserved that. I had endured enough bullying through my time in high school, for the fact I enjoyed my education.

‘Oh. Excuse me? Are you implying you were not going to come to the party of your next Alpha?’ Miles links with some serious attitude.

‘Miles, you just asked why I had bothered coming. Now you are asking if I was not going to come? Make your mind up.’ I argued.

‘Remember who I am Bailey. You are not above me. Never will be. Could have been equal to me at most had I seen you as suitable to be my mate, but no. You were beneath that honor.’ He sneers.

I felt anger racing through me. ‘And you think I would not have rejected you?’ I snapped, moving back toward the exit, not wanting to be here anymore. Until I felt a hand grabbing the back of my tank top, yanking me back.

My eyes darted upward to see the dark eyes of Miles. Sneering down at me. Our Pack’s upcoming Alpha. The most arrogant man I think I have ever met. One, thankfully, I did not have to be mates with any longer as the stupid fucker had chosen to reject his own fated mate before even giving her a chance. “Going somewhere Bailey?” he asked, his voice full of spite.

“Well, I do believe you asked me why I was here, so I assumed you wanted me to leave.” I told him.

Miles bows his head down so it is level with mine, he inhales deeply, like he still enjoys the scent of me. He has done this numerous times of late, which I find quite bizarre. But, I ignore him as he tilts his head to look at me, “Hmm, I think my Mum and Dad may have something to say if you leave. Their clever little Bailey. Heaven forbid.” He presses his forehead against mine. “Just stay away from me, and do not spoil my fun.”

I shake my head in disbelief at him, as he stalks away. Did he even think for a moment I would be going near him if I could avoid it? I would rather be anywhere but near him!

“Bailey, why are you harassing my friend for?” I heard my brother, Jordan demand, as he suddenly approached, causing many people to turn around and look at me. Wonderful. Nothing like starting pack gossip is there. I am sure Miles would appreciate that!

“I wasn’t harassing him, he came to speak to me. Asking why I had come.” I told him, and my brother laughed. He is as much an idiot as Miles. Any of my friends who have big brothers hate how protective they are. Me? No, my big brother is the one leading all the bullying and being a total dick to me. He finds great embarrassment in the fact his younger sister is far from being one of the popular group, and is, in his words, ‘far too into her books’. I think, in all honesty, my entire family found me, in one way or another, a huge embarrassment.

“Well, he has a point. Not like you will be joining in with the celebrations. You will probably be sitting in a quiet corner somewhere reading.” He teases.

“Well, it is certainly more intellectually pleasing than any of you would be.” I smirked at him as I walked away from my brother who was standing looking confused. I am sure he had no clue what I meant. The scary thing is he will be the next, pack Beta. Heaven help our pack. Between him and Miles they only had one brain cell between them, and that was one that they shared, I am sure of it! And even then, I think it was rechargeable and started losing power and knowledge at a rapid rate! They only graduated high school because they paid people to do their work for them.

As I snuck away, out of the busy lounge to the top of the stairway, where I hoped to hide out for as long as possible, I heard footsteps behind me. I quickly turned, hoping it was simply someone on their way to their bedroom or even to one of the spare bathrooms on this floor. But, sadly, luck was not on my side tonight. No. Miles was following me. Eyebrows raised and looking quite irritated.

“Oi. I want to talk to you.” he demanded.

“You asked me to go away a minute ago, didn’t you?” I asked him.

“Don’t think so, think it was more a case of why you were here.” Miles says with a smirk. Sitting on the top step with me.

“Miles, you have the whole pack here for your birthday, I am sure whatever you need to speak to me about can wait.” I shrugged, desperately craving peace, which, considering the pounding beat of the music playing, would be difficult.

“No. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” he questions, like he is irate at the fact I had not let him know. Why would I let him know?

“Why would I? We aren’t friends, Miles. You also are not my Alpha yet. It was arranged with my parents, me and your Dad, as Alpha.” I explained to him, unsure why this would even bother him. If anything, I would think he would be glad to get rid of me.

“You are going away though.” he murmurs.

“That is generally what happens when you go to college or university. Yeah.” I said with another shrug.

“There wasn’t one closer to home?” he hisses. “Because it seems to me you picked the one furthest away.”

“What does it matter to you? You hate me. I won't be here, You get your wish of being rid of me.” I snapped, truly sick of him trying to dictate to me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. I had worked hard in school, so I could do this. My parents had spoken to my Aunt and Uncle, the Luna and Alpha of our pack to allow me special permission to go to a university out of state to study, saying it was what I had dreamed of. I had nothing holding me back. And, with the fact Miles did not want me for his mate, or his Luna, I truly did not. Not that any of them knew of that. That was our own secret.

Even despite the pull to him as my mate since my wolf had arrived, I still found him truly repulsive. He sickened me. Though, the pains when he slept with the many she-wolves that visited his bed, made it even easier to detest the man that he had become. I still had no clue what I had done to deserve this treatment from this man, other than not being one of the popular group. But, I knew I deserved better than him.

Miles glanced at me, momentarily a thoughtful look passed over his face, almost caring, before a hardness replaced it. “That much is true. No more having to see the disappointing failure the moon goddess made of mating me to you. At least not for a few years. Who knows, perhaps you will meet someone while there. I suggest you do. That way you won’t have to come back, because, I, as Alpha, will be looking for my Luna.”

“Miles, I honestly do not care if you find someone else.” I told him, going to stand and head home, not wishing to spend another moment in the same place as him.

As I went to move away, he grabbed my hand, pulling me to him, so I was once more sitting level with him on the top step of the first floor landing of our packhouse. “Always so righteous aren’t you Bailey? You say you don’t care? We will see. Well, this will be on my terms. I, Miles Davenport, reject you, Bailey West, as my fated mate…” he began, and my head began to whirl as his words sunk in. The realization and excruciating pain of what was happening becoming too much for me…

# Chapter 3 Bailey

Three Years Later

I drove the long road down to pack. I hated this drive. It was like returning to hell for me. Lotus Shadow Pack. My very own version of hell. Though, three years away, studying had been truly amazing. Transforming myself into the woman I should always have been. Confident. Self-assured. Brave. Just me. And now a fully qualified teacher.

As a she-wolf, you spend so many years of your life being told your focus is finding your fated mate. Settling down with them and creating a strong matebond. A love. A family. Well, once I had come to accept that my naïve, teenage dreams would never surface, thanks to the moon goddess pairing me with a mate so incapable of loving anyone other than himself, I decided that my focus would be my career. My education had always been something I took great pride in. I loved to learn, and I had decided that I wanted to pass that gift along. I no longer cared what others thought of me. And, while at university, it felt so wonderful to be surrounded by others who felt the same way. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere.

And, I believe that is what allowed me to become the person I was meant to be. However, now, I had to return to my pack, at their orders. The agreement was, once I had completed my degree, I would return home. Unless, of course, I had found my fated mate. But, I knew within my heart, that was never to happen. For, my fated mate sat at home. Lording it over our pack. Acting like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Sleeping with any she-wolf that came near him, from what I heard, having rejected me.

I pulled up at our guarded pack gates. Harley, one of our pack warriors, currently on guard duty, stepped forward to my car window. “ID” he ordered.

I frowned at him. I do not think I have been asked for ID before when returning home, even in all the times I have visited home, though in all fairness, those visits have been few and far between. My visits were only when they were required of me. I had grown to loathe this place, and coming back had become less of a priority for me over the time I was away...

“Harley, it is me. Bailey.” I explained, trying not to smile at his mistake.

Harley looked at me closer. “Shit. Sorry Bailey, didn’t really recognize you there. You changed your hair. And you aren’t wearing your glasses. You look good.” He says with a shrug, quickly looking away, clearly embarrassed by his faux-pas.

I smirk at his response. Yes, my hair is somewhat tamer than it used to be. The curls straightened out, and my hair now neat and sleek down my back. My glasses I had worn for reading had been long gone. Having got my eyes fixed with laser eye surgery whilst away. Plus, I now wore a little simple make-up to accentuate my features. Nice to know somebody has noticed a difference…

“No problem. You still need ID?” I asked him.

He grins at me. “I think I know who you are. Nice to see you.” he nods at me in acknowledgment as the gate opens for me. “Maybe catch you around while you are back.” He adds as I begin to drive away.

I smiled in response, I guess there would be nothing to stop me catching up with any guy I wanted to now. Not that I was really bothered right now... but it was not like I had a fated mate to wait for any longer. And it wasn’t like Miles was making a point of staying single. Every time I had returned home, he had had a different she-wolf on his arm. Parading them through pack like a prized possession, only to have traded her in by the time I returned on my next visit. He was turning into quite the lothario. And quite a joke in my eyes.

I set off along the quiet, familiar roads of our sweet old pack. The evening sun was settling in the sky as I moved my car down the route to my family home. No doubt my Mum would be there waiting for me, perhaps my Dad, if he was in from work by now. My brother and sister, I was unsure. They still both lived at home with my parents, but were back and forth to friends' homes and my brother was looking to move into the Beta suite in the packhouse soon enough, in preparation for taking on the role from my father when the time came. Either way, they rarely bothered to rush home to see me when they knew I was returning. I don’t think seeing me was at the top of their priority list…

I pulled my car up on the street in front of my familiar family home. I could not believe I was home. Stuck back here. The dread within my stomach churned heavily at the prospect of many years stuck here. Miserable and unhappy, with no way out, now my fated mate had rejected me. Not that anyone other than Miles and I knew of that. No. He had decided he would be considered weak if others knew an Alpha had gone against the powerful Moon Goddess’s choice. So, this was our secret. Or he would make me pay in ways I did not want to imagine, apparently.

And, in all honesty, I did not want to think of it. He had allowed me to go away to do my degree. Doing the final bit of convincing when my Uncle, the current Alpha, and Miles’s father, along with my parents were on the fence. Or, so he said. How true that was, I would never likely know the truth, but it had been for that reason, and that alone I had chosen to do as he had asked.

If he had done the things he said, then he had allowed me to fulfill my dream of gaining my degree of teaching away from pack. To allow me to be just me, not the daughter of the pack Beta. And I have thrived because of it. But, now, I had to return. Back to where I belonged. And, while I may have gained my degree, I had no real future prospects. I was likely stuck here.

I stepped from the car, determined more than ever to find work, as I heard my Mum’s voice. “Bailey!” she greeted me from the porch steps, a big smile upon her face. “You look beautiful sweetheart.”

I smiled back at her, as I moved toward the front door. Only to see Miles leaving the house next door to ours. The Alpha home. Could I have timed my arrival home any worse?

His eyes met mine, giving me a dark stare before looking at my Mum. “Hi Aunt Brianna. You didn’t say she was home today.”

Mum smiled at Miles like she thought the world of him, though most of the time she generally did. “Ah, I think it slipped my mind. Bailey is home for good now, Miles. How wonderful is that?”

Once more, Miles gave me a dark stare. “Hmmm. Truly wonderful.” he said with some serious contempt in his voice.

‘You stay out of my way unless I say otherwise, you understand?’ Miles mindlinks me, as he moves toward his car.

“Are you not going to speak to him Bai?” Mum tries. “He will be Alpha this time next year, you know?”

“Oh it doesn’t matter, Aunt Brianna. Bailey will be excused this time. I am sure she is tired from her drive back home. But no doubt I will be seeing her around. And yes, she will have to get used to me as her senior. Her Alpha.” He says with a sneer, and at his words my stomach twists into knots. I don’t think I can stay here… I not only need to find work, I need to find work away from my pack, so I can move away to get away from my psychotic Alpha and ex-mate!

# Chapter 4 Bailey

I sit out in the garden drinking my morning coffee, with my laptop open scrolling desperately through the job vacancies, when I hear a deep growl to my left, causing me to swirl my head to look. Miles was resting his head on the garden fence from next door, overlooking our back garden, to where I was sitting. Watching me intently, the look upon his face was one of sheer disgust...

I had no clue how long he had been standing there, or what had angered him to the point of growling, but he had made me jump. “Fucking hell, Miles.” I snapped, giving him a dark scowl. I had done well the past week since arriving and stayed out of his way. Managing to ensure I avoided all pack events, and ensuring I dodged any places he was likely to be. Yes, it meant I spent an awful lot of time in my bedroom at home, but I would rather do that than have to deal with him.

Today, the sun was glorious, and I thought it would be nice to take my breakfast outside while I looked for jobs online. Sitting on the patio furniture we have in the back garden, under the warmth of the morning sunshine, my coffee was enjoyable, all until this stupid fucker disturbed me. I shook my head in his direction, wondering why he had snuck up on me. He had so many more places he could be...

“Who do you think you are cursing at?” Miles snarled.

“The creep who did exactly that. Crept up on me out of the blue for no good reason.” I rolled my eyes at him in disgust, only to see this seemed to anger him further. Though, I think anything I did would anger Miles. He seemed to hold some serious resentment towards me at the moment, but should I really expect anything less?

“I will come over there and deal with you, Bailey.” He hissed.

“Deal with me?” I questioned his choice of words. “Deal with me how? You asked me to stay out of your way. That is what I am doing.”

“What are you doing?” he chose to ignore my words, and looks to my laptop screen instead, so I slowly shut the screen down, so he would be unable to see. I do not want him knowing I am applying for work outside the area. I would not put it past him to stop it from happening. He seems to be being deliberately nasty of late, so I truly do not know what he would sink to, in order to be nasty towards me…

“Nothing of your concern.”

“I am your Alpha. So, all that goes on in my pack is my business.” He tells me with a smirk.

I shook my head with a smirk back, “Hmm, not quite Miles, you are not. Your Dad is still Alpha, so don’t be getting ahead of yourself.”

An angry look flared across his face once more. His handsome features contorted in fury. He did not like having people disagree with him. But I was not about to have him dictating to me...

“Just because you were my mate once upon a time does not give you the right to talk to me however you please, you know.” Miles snarls.

A SM from another store comes through the DT at my store multiple times a week for her partner beverage because we are otw to her store and open earlier. Because of this, I asked every shift at my store and both managers and was told the you can get your partner bev from any store as long as it’s within 30 minutes of your shift start. I open every day and there is a 24 hr store that only adds 10 minutes to my commute. It is better for *everyone* that I’m caffeinated before work and I don’t want to deal with grinding coffee and stuff at 3 in the morning when my bf is trying to sleep. I was specifically told by my store manager that I can go to that store and get my beverage before work because it is within the policy. 

I’ve been stopping at this store before work every day for over a month with no issues. But today the person at the window told me they’re the store manager and that your partner beverage has to come from the store you’re working at. Explained to her the manager from the other store “well she’s not supposed to do that” explained to her that my manager told me this was allowed and she just asked me what store I’m from again. I told her and told her I would talk to my manager. 

But does anyone know the policy before I go making a bigger stink about this? More than anything I’m irritated because I wouldn’t have even been doing this had my manager not specifically told me it’s fine.

## FAQs Section

**what size transformer do I⁣ need for my⁣ appliance?**
To determine the correct ‌transformer size, check ⁤the‌ power rating of ‍your appliance ⁤in watts (W) or volt-amperes (VA), often located⁤ on a​ label near ‌the power ‌cord ⁢or on the back​ of the device.⁤ Select a transformer with a VA rating ​that ​exceeds the ‌appliance's power​ rating by at least 20% to provide a safety margin and prevent overheating.running your appliance close to ⁣limit of the ⁢transformer can cause premature component⁢ failure, potentially‌ reducing the transformer’s⁣ lifespan.

**Can I use a step-up‍ and step-down transformer interchangeably?**
Not all transformers are designed for bidirectional voltage conversion. ⁤While some transformers can be​ used in both⁢ step-up (120V to 240V) and ⁤step-down (240V to 120V) configurations, ⁢others⁢ are specifically designed for one-way conversion.Always check the manufacturer's ‍specifications to confirm the transformer's capabilities before using it in a different configuration than intended. Doing so can‍ potentially damage both the transformer and the connected appliances.

**Are isolation transformers the same as 120 to 240 transformers?**
While some 120 to⁣ 240 transformers may also function as isolation transformers, not all 120 to 240 ​transformers provide isolation. Isolation transformers⁤ provide galvanic isolation between the input and output circuits, offering additional protection against ‍electrical ⁢shock and reducing noise ⁢in sensitive electronic equipment. Check the product specifications to determine if the ‌transformer includes isolation capabilities beyond voltage⁣ conversion.

**What is⁣ the expected lifespan of a 120 to 240 transformer?**
The lifespan of a 120 to 240 transformer can vary significantly depending on factors such as build quality, operating ​conditions, and ⁢load.Under normal operating conditions,​ a quality transformer can ‍last for 10-20 years ⁢or even longer. Overloading the transformer, operating it ‌in high-temperature environments, ​or subjecting it to frequent voltage fluctuations can reduce ⁤its lifespan. Regular maintenance,⁢ such ​as cleaning vents and checking for loose connections⁢ can also extend ​its ⁤operational life.

1mdvdds,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1mdvdds/bored_parents_during_football_practice/,Bored parents during football practice,"
It’s early evening, and I head out for a walk around the sports field just outside my house. It’s a typical fieldscene—kids running around in football gear, coaches shouting out instructions— football training is in full gear. 

As I stroll by, I glance over at the sidelines and notice something: or rather not notice something: the parents. I don't see a single parent watching their kids from the sideline. I mean I get it, it is not an actual match so probably not that interesting for them to watch- Or perhaps they’ve all gone to the local pub for a cheeky midweek pint?

As I continue walking, the mystery begins to solve itself. Lining the edge of the field is a row of parked cars, each one occupied by a parent silently scrolling on their phone, waiting for training to finish. 

I can’t help but wonder—why sit alone in the car in boredom when you could be on the sidelines chatting to other parents, passing the time with actual human interaction? It's not even particularly cold tonight, and yet this car-sitting ritual seems to be the standard, whether it's winter or the middle of summer.

And it gets me thinking—why don’t sports grounds here in New Zealand have a simple little canteen or bar? Somewhere casual where parents could grab a coffee or a drink and catch up with each other while the kids do their thing. 

Instead, every parent is tucked away in their own little metal box, seeing every minute slowly pass. And so the story ends sad.

I 20F was seeing a guy 21M on and off for 6 months who said and did a lot of things that made me feel like he really cared. He told me I was the nicest person he’d ever met. He remembered my coffee order, took me on spontaneous dates, called me often, and even referred to his place as “home” when texting me.

But despite all that, his actions were confusing, hurtful, and at times, downright disrespectful. He would offer to drive me home and then make me Uber last-minute, then leave, sometimes before the ride even got there. He’d yell, accuse me of things that weren’t true, and tried to bend my boundaries and once i spoke up about being uncomfortable he’d ghost. 

He got upset when I said I felt sick after taking Plan B and then got his mom involved, even though I said I’d be okay.

He also didn’t tell me a lot about his mental health stuff going on but i told him about mine because i wanted transparency between us. 



This cycle repeated multiple times. He’d come back after a few weeks, apologize, say he felt guilty, and ask for another chance. But each time, it felt like he hurt me more.

If you’re exploring new flavor profiles, check out the options for [buying whole coffee beans](https://kitline.com/product-category/food-and-beverage/bar-and-beverage/coffee-beans/).

On the other hand, the washed process removes the cherry from the bean early, producing a cleaner taste with brighter acidity. This method is favored by professionals and specialty cafes aiming for clarity and balance. If you're running a coffee shop and want high-quality, balanced coffee, consider [buying Arabica coffee for cafes](https://kitline.com/product-category/food-and-beverage/bar-and-beverage/coffee-beans/).

Lastly, the honey process blends elements of both methods, offering a smooth mouthfeel with layered sweetness. It's a great choice for specialty espresso drinks.

A few years ago, I got into community theatre as an adult through a production of *Something Rotten* — and I was instantly hooked. That experience gave me a new appreciation for performing arts, a creative outlet I didn’t realize I needed, and some of the first real friendships I’d made since school.

But I quickly noticed something: it can be really hard to find nearby theater groups, spaces, and shows. They’re scattered across websites, Facebook pages, old posters in coffee shops — and many don’t have much of a digital presence at all.

So I built something to help.

🎭 [**DramaClub**](https://dramaclub.app).app is a free app for community theater.

* Discover local venues, events, and auditions
* Connect with performers and creators
* Organize projects with private groups and collaboration tools

It’s **100% free**, no ads, and I’m covering all expenses myself right now. Eventually, I may add something lightweight like ticketing or donations to help cover costs — but right now, I just need feedback.

BUT - it's a community-driven platform and it only works if it gains traction. I'm a one man band and don't have any marketing behind this.

If you’re in a show, run a group, or just love this world like I do, I’d love for you to give it a try and let me know what works, what doesn’t, and what would make it more useful for you. Bring your friends. Post an audition. Create a collab group. I’ll be responsive to feedback and bugs!

1mdv5r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1mdv5r9/7_principles_from_deep_work_that_actually/,"7 principles from ""Deep Work"" that actually transformed my output (and why shallow work was destroying my potential)","Read this book when I realized I was ""busy"" all day but accomplishing nothing meaningful. Constantly switching between tasks, checking notifications every 5 minutes, and wondering why my most important projects never got done. Here's what actually transformed how I work:

1. Deep work is a superpower, shallow work is quicksand

I started tracking my time and was horrified at how 80% of my day was spent on emails, meetings, and random tasks that felt urgent but weren't important. Now I block 3-4 hours daily for deep work on my most valuable projects. I now accomplish more in those focused hours than I used to in entire days.

2. Attention residue is killing your focus

Every time you switch tasks, part of your brain stays stuck on the previous task. I used to jump from writing to emails to Slack to research. Now I batch similar tasks and use transition rituals (like a 2-minute walk) between deep work sessions to fully reset my attention.

3. Create rituals, not just schedules

I built a specific deep work ritual: same coffee shop corner, noise-canceling headphones, phone in airplane mode, and a legal pad for capturing random thoughts. The consistency signals to my brain that it's time to focus. My brain now automatically shifts into deep work mode when I follow this routine.

4. Embrace productive meditation

During walks or mundane tasks like folding laundry, I practice productive meditation - focusing deeply on a single professional problem. No phone, no music, just pure thinking time. I've solved more complex problems during 20-minute walks than in hours of scattered desk time.

5. Quit social media (or at least tame it)

I deleted Instagram and Twitter from my phone and only check them from my laptop during designated times. The constant dopamine hits were training my brain to crave distraction. Now I can read for hours without feeling the urge to check my phone every few minutes.

6. Schedule every minute (but stay flexible)

I started time-blocking my entire day, not just work hours. Even leisure time gets blocked. This isn't about being rigid but about being intentional. When interruptions happen (and they will), I quickly adjust the remaining blocks. No minute goes unaccounted for.

7. Work like hell, then shut down completely

I created a shutdown ritual: review tomorrow's priorities, close all tabs, say ""schedule shutdown complete"" out loud. After this ritual, I don't check work emails or think about projects. This complete separation allows my brain to recharge and often leads to breakthrough insights the next day.

I stopped glorifying ""busy"" and started measuring my days by depth, not hours logged. One hour of deep work on my book project is worth more than six hours of shallow email responses.

My biggest mistake before was thinking I could multitask my way to productivity. The human brain doesn't multitask  it task-switches, and every switch costs focus and energy.

A Goddess In Disguise: Divorce, Marriage, Domination","
A Goddess In Disguise: Divorce, Marriage, Domination

Chapter 1 The Fake Daughter Loses Everything
""Mrs. Gibson, do you have anything to say about your husband showing up at Marilee Jenkins' birthday party today and announcing that he's going to divorce you?""

""People are saying Marilee is Mr. Gibson's first love and the real daughter of your parents, while you're the fake. You've been enjoying her parents' love all this time and married to the man meant for her. Do you feel bad about that?""

""Your parents just said you're not really their daughter and cut off your money. You've been out of work for two years, living as a housewife, so how exactly do you plan to support yourself now? Mrs. Gibson, any comments?""

The birthday party was crowded, and Alexia Gibson found herself completely trapped. 

Reporters quickly closed in on her, pushing cameras and microphones into her face as camera flashes burst from every direction, giving her no space to breathe. 

Alexia just stood there, frozen. Her mind was still spinning from everything she'd just heard. 

So this Marilee Jenkins was the real daughter of her so-called parents and her husband's true love. 

And her? She was Roger Gibson's wife on paper, but clearly, just a joke to everyone else. 

Years ago, the Jenkins couple had pulled her out of some run-down neighborhood overseas, saying she was their long-lost daughter. 

But had they really not bothered doing a simple DNA test before welcoming her in? 

Why did they only discover the mistake now? 

Alexia's body tensed up. Her eyes drifted over to the man standing next to her. However, Roger's attention was not on her. He was looking at Marilee, as if they were the only ones in the room. 

Her voice came out strained as she asked, ""Why? You didn't even tell me.""

Roger's face was as cold as stone. ""Now you know. That's all that matters. It's over, Alexia. You were never good enough for me. Our marriage? Just a transaction. The only woman I've ever loved is Marilee. And you know why I never touched you after the wedding? Because you disgust me. You're like a spoiled dish--completely unappetizing.""

His eyes swept over her from head to toe, full of scorn. Her simple clothes, those outdated glasses--everything about her clashed with the glossy, high-class world he lived in. 

Before his harsh words even fully sank in, Alexia lifted her glass and threw the champagne right into his face. 

The drink hit him with a loud splash, soaking his face and pricey suit. He just stood there, stunned, as the liquid dripped from his hair and down his face. 

""A spoiled dish? You told me you wanted an ordinary housewife. Dad and Mom told me they wanted an obedient daughter, who never outdid anyone!""

Without hesitation, she threw the glass to the floor. The sharp crash instantly silenced the whole room. 

Roger's face turned red with embarrassment. His jaw tightened. ""Have you lost your mind?""

From the stage, the Jenkins couple yelled at her. ""Alexia, this is Marilee's birthday, not a place for your drama!""

People in the crowd rolled their eyes and muttered that she was nuts. 

None of them had a clue what she had given up for the two families all these years. 

Shoving through the crowd, Alexia made a beeline for the exit. Reporters swarmed after her like a flood. 

She shoved past them all, blind to the pouring rain, deaf to the murmurs and judgment surrounding her. Right now, all she wanted was to get away--far from the noise, the eyes, and the humiliation. 

But just as she broke through the crowd and made it outside, a bunch of Marilee's wild fans shoved her hard, and she slipped, landing on the wet road. 

Marilee was an A-list star in showbiz. Her birthday party was being livestreamed, and tons of fans had gathered outside. The second they saw Alexia step out, the crowd lost it, shouting like wild animals who had just found something to attack. 

""Alexia, you've got some nerve attending Marilee's birthday party. You've got no shame!""

""You're not even the real daughter. Just go back to whatever dump you came from, or are you too hooked on the Jenkins' money?""

""Roger's going to divorce you, and you still think it's okay to show your face around Marilee? Who do you think you are?""

""Go away already!""

Alexia lay there on the wet street, frozen for a second, while their nasty words echoed all around her. 

She let out a dry, bitter laugh. Everything was such a joke. A broken marriage, a cold family, and now they'd left her completely humiliated. 

What was the point of pretending for so long? She had kept her head down, put up with everything, and this was what she got in the end? 

A wave of helplessness washed over her. She closed her eyes, not even caring anymore as the freezing rain drenched her. 

Through the noise and chaos, a flattering voice broke through. ""Mr. Mason."" The polite greeting was followed by firm, steady footsteps coming closer in the rain. 

Moments later, a black umbrella appeared above her, silently cutting through the rain and offering her shelter from the storm. 


Chapter 2 Meeting Him Again At Her Absolute Worst
Alexia slowly looked up and met a sharp, intense gaze. 

The streetlights flickered in the rain. Waylon Mason stood there, tall and intimidating, with a strong presence that made people uncomfortable. 

Behind him was a row of fancy cars parked along the street, catching everyone's eye. 

His assistants were standing on both sides of him, and one was holding an umbrella over his head. 

But the umbrella Waylon was holding was tilted just to cover Alexia. 

Waylon took a slow step forward and leaned in. Before she could react, his fingers reached up and removed the heavy, black-rimmed glasses from her face. Her bright, beautiful eyes were now fully visible. 

He looked down at her with a smirk. ""It's been years, Alexia. Look at you--what a mess. Did you finally stop being that love-crazy girl, or are you still dreaming useless dreams?""

Every word cut deeper. Alexia's eyes started to tear up, and the little bit of strength she had left broke down under his harsh voice. 

She opened her mouth to retort, but before she could speak, Waylon suddenly picked her up in his arms in front of everyone, protecting her from the rain and everything around them. 

He walked toward the black car waiting nearby, carrying her as the bodyguards quickly stepped aside to make way. 

All the noise and the rude comments around them faded away. 

Everyone just stood there, stunned, watching them leave with shock written all over their faces. 

...

Inside the car, Alexia held onto her muddy, soaked dress with trembling hands. 

She looked down, her voice rough. ""Waylon, why'd you have to show up now?""

Why now...when everything in her life was falling apart? 

Waylon tilted his head at her question, then reached out and took her chin in his hand, gently but firmly lifting her face. His voice was calm, yet carried a cold edge. ""Why else? I came to check on the woman I liked the least.""

His eyes darkened, a smirk playing on his lips. ""So, Alexia, do you remember what I said to you seven years ago?""

Of course she did. 

Waylon was the golden child of the Mason family. Her biggest rival back in the day. 

The last time they met was at the airport, seven years ago. What was meant to be a goodbye turned into their worst fight. 

Waylon always hated how she begged for the Jenkins family's approval and how she held onto Roger like she had no pride. And she couldn't stand his ego and how he judged everyone she cared about. 

Back then, he'd warned her clearly--chasing approval from people who'd never truly accept her would only end in disappointment, leaving her with nothing in the end. 

But she was too hopeful to see it. She had told herself, ""It's okay if they don't like me now. If I work hard and put them first, they'll accept me eventually.""

They wanted her to marry Roger, so she agreed. Her brothers didn't want her getting too powerful, so she acted clueless and average. But behind the scenes, she was quietly taking out their threats and protecting both the Jenkins and the Gibson families. 

As Waylon's fingers held her jaw tightly, her warm tears fell on his hand, running down his knuckles. His expression wavered. The coldness faded just for a second. Then, he let go. 

Alexia's voice shook, still raspy from the rain. ""Waylon, you were right. They tossed me aside after exploiting me. For more than twenty years, I gave them everything I had. I was so st**id.""

It was a long time before Waylon finally spoke again. ""You were not st**id. They just weren't worth it.""

But Alexia didn't respond. 

He turned to look at her and saw her fast asleep. 

Later that night, Alexia suddenly came down with a high fever. 

Santino Blake, Waylon's personal doctor, got pulled out of bed by a single call and had to grab his stuff and rush over late at night. 

With his years of experience, Santino quickly ran a full checkup. He stood by the bed, looking at Alexia's pale, tired face, and let out a soft sigh. 


Chapter 3 Our Luna Is Back
Santino glanced over his shoulder and caught sight of Waylon on the balcony, cigarette burning slowly between his fingers. 

Sm**e curled up in lazy spirals, casting a ghostly veil over Waylon's sharp features, softening them with each exhale. 

Waylon rarely smoked. Santino could only recall one other time Waylon had smoked like this--two years ago. 

Santino stepped outside and joined him. ""She's stable now. She just picked up a chill from being stuck in the rain and took the shock pretty hard. I've given her an injection and some medication--she'll be all right.""

A brief pause allowed Santino to scan the night sky. ""I checked the headlines. The Jenkins family didn't just cut her off; they humiliated her for everyone to see--right in the middle of Marilee's birthday party.""

Anger edged into Santino's voice. ""Hadn't they done a DNA test before taking her back from abroad? This whole thing smells like a setup.""

A sudden vibration broke his focus--Alexia's phone was buzzing on the nightstand. 

Waylon strode inside, intent on ending the call, but the name flashing on the screen stopped him cold. A flicker of something dark flashed across his eyes as he picked up and put on the speaker. 

Shouting erupted instantly, the caller's anger unmistakable. 

""Alexia, you've ignored every call and message. What exactly are you trying to pull? Faking your own disappearance won't help. Tomorrow, you're signing the divorce agreement, and that's the end of it. I've shown enough patience. Stop standing in the way of Marilee and me. You've lived off the Jenkins family long enough. If you have any dignity left, walk away for good--it's the least you can do for Marilee. Don't worry about your share--you'll get what's coming. You looked after my grandmother and my mother these past years, fine. But don't overstep. Learn when to quit. Why aren't you answering me? Where are you?""

The stillness that lingered on the line finally made Roger uneasy. His confidence wavered and his words lost their edge. 

Santino internally begged for someone to step in and stop what was happening, feeling panic surge as things slipped further from control. 

From the moment Roger started speaking, Santino caught the way Waylon's face darkened. His eyes went cold and every hint of warmth vanished, leaving the atmosphere icy and suffocating. Santino could barely stand, knees threatening to give way. 

Waylon's expression turned sharp, his smile edged with cruelty. ""So that's the way you speak to her, huh?""

Every muscle in Roger's body tensed, instincts screaming a warning. His voice grew cautious. ""Who are you? Where is Alexia?""

Waylon let his gaze settle on the bed, where Alexia rested, her breathing faint but even. His response came as a gentle murmur, almost lost in the tension. ""She's asleep.""

He let a short silence hang before adding, ""And she's right here with me.""

The only thing that answered him was the explosive sound of rage through the phone. Roger's voice thundered down the line. ""What did you just say? Who are you?""

Amusement glimmered in Waylon's eyes as a low chuckle slipped out. ""Relax. You'll figure it out...assuming you live long enough."" Without another word, he ended the call. 

By morning, the rain had vanished, leaving sunlight streaming through the windows as Alexia stirred awake. 

She reached for her phone, greeted by a storm of missed calls and furious messages from Roger. 

Without reacting, she scrolled through the flood of texts, then let the device drop onto the sheets. Right now, a hot shower mattered more. 

Steam fogged the bathroom mirror as she faced her reflection. Something had changed--her eyes, once dull, now held a spark she hadn't seen in ages. 

For the first time in ages, she tried out a smile, and this one actually reached her eyes, genuine and alive. 

It felt like a fever had burned away all her confusion, stripping her heart of old pain and foolish loyalty to those who never deserved it. 

No more playing the fool. No more pretending everything was fine. This sad story was over. 

Wrapped in a towel after the shower, she scanned her contacts and paused on a name untouched for years. 

Her call barely rang once before chaos exploded on the other end. ""Luna! It's about d**n time! Tell me--are the rumors true? You're finally getting a divorce?""

Laughter and shouting burst from the background, her friends making no attempt to hide their eavesdropping. 

Alexia replied calmly, ""Yes, I'm going to sign the divorce agreement today.""

Celebration roared through the phone. Whistles, cheers, the clink of glasses--her friends were clearly turning it into a full-blown party. 

""Took you long enough to snap out of that trance! No more housewife blues. Our Luna is back!""

""Divorce is the best thing to happen to you! Roger never deserved you. Say the word and I'll handle him myself!""

""And don't get me started on that overrated Jenkins family. If not for you, they'd have collapsed during last year's crash. Luna, we're ready when you are--the Helix Consortium stands with you.""

Their laughter and support brought a genuine grin to Alexia's lips. ""In that case, I need a ride.""

Without missing a beat, a man's voice broke in, buzzing with excitement. ""A ride? For your grand return? Name it. I'll send the reigning racing champion to pick you up!""


Chapter 4 Do You Believe Me
The call had barely ended when the soft click of the door caught Alexia's attention, her head snapping up. 

There in the doorway stood Waylon, his height casting a shadow, his expression giving nothing away as their eyes met. 

Neither of them had anticipated this kind of encounter. 

Fresh from the shower, Alexia's hair clung damply to her cheeks, a robe slipping low on her shoulders, skin flushed and eyes still hazy with warmth. 

That oversized bathrobe, threatening to slip further, revealed soft lines of skin; the faint scent of shampoo lingered in the air, sweet and impossible to ignore. 

Waylon's gaze swept over her, lingering just long enough for her cheeks to flush, before he looked away calmly. ""Get ready. Breakfast is on the table.""

Moments later, Alexia emerged dressed, met by the aroma of a beautifully arranged breakfast. Hunger won out over pride; she took her seat without pretense, finishing most of the meal before pausing for breath. 

Little was said as Waylon let her eat in peace, only breaking the silence after she'd nearly cleared her plate. ""You need a lawyer?""

She set down her coffee cup, eyes meeting his squarely. ""So you've heard.""

Amusement tugged at his mouth, though his eyes stayed cold. ""Is there anyone left who doesn't?""

Alexia tasted the bitterness of the coffee and grimaced for just a moment, though she quickly composed herself. ""I can deal with it.""

As the words left her mouth, she realized he might think she was too stubborn to admit she needed help. After all, in most people's eyes, women being dumped were pathetic. 

""Do you believe me when I say that?"" she asked. 

A smirk played on Waylon's face, eyes narrowing with a knowing glint. ""Why wouldn't I? Alexia, he's the one who should've fallen apart.""

That unwavering gaze held her still, though she managed a small, genuine smile in return. ""You've always known how to make a good point.""

Once breakfast was done, Alexia got ready to leave. 

Reaching the doorway, she stopped and glanced back. ""Thank you,"" she said quietly, her gratitude unmistakable. 

There was no chance she'd forget his kindness. 

...

Ten minutes had ticked past their appointment, and Roger's patience was quickly wearing thin as he and Marilee waited for Alexia in a private club. 

""Why isn't she here yet? Is she refusing to divorce you?"" Marilee pressed herself closer to him, sugar in her tone as she pouted. ""You haven't forgotten our shopping plans, right? You promised you'd buy me a gown after this.""

Roger hummed in response. The weekend's banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce would be the perfect stage to introduce Marilee--the timing of her comeback couldn't have been more ideal. Every influential name in town would be present, all eyes fixed on Waylon's much-anticipated return. 

Just thinking about Waylon sent a flicker of unease across Roger's face. 

The Chamber of Commerce's open support for Waylon right before the election of its new president wasn't exactly good news for the Gibson family. 

A sudden uproar near the doorway snapped Roger's focus. 

His head turned, and in that instant, it felt as though the atmosphere in the room shifted. 

Everyone's attention zeroed in on a single figure gliding inside with effortless grace. 

Alexia walked in, her crimson dress hugging every curve, heels whispering over the polished floor. Each stride radiated poise and quiet confidence. The scarlet hue, that unmistakable glow--she looked like the sunrise brought to life. 

With each step Alexia took, Marilee's smile grew tighter, until it disappeared altogether when Alexia claimed the seat across from them. 

Roger couldn't hide his shock either; his eyes remained glued to Alexia's artfully made-up features. 

""You..."" Words caught in his throat, visible in the small, nervous bob of his Adam's apple. 

Nobody present could believe this woman was the same person from last night--the awkward glasses, the baggy checkered shirt, the sopping hair. 

Yesterday's pitiful girl had been replaced by someone utterly different, confident, unrecognizable. 

Nothing about their surprise caught Alexia off guard. Her beauty wasn't news to her; she'd just chosen not to make a show of it. Childhood lessons had always emphasized modesty, staying out of the spotlight, never inviting too much notice. 

Marriage only tightened the leash. Years spent tending to Roger's grandmother and fielding disapproval from a mother-in-law who'd been fed tales of her so-called wild youth. 

Not even her hair or the color of her clothes escaped scrutiny. Every detail had been censored into drab submission. 

Vibrant dresses never made it to her closet--only baggy, forgettable options filled the shelves. 

That chapter, though, was behind her. 

With unhurried confidence, Alexia called over a server, ordered a tequila, and began paging through the divorce agreement--unfazed by the attention. 

Marilee recovered her composure first, flashing a sweet smile. ""Alexia, I hope you're alright after yesterday. The reporters caught us all off guard. Someone told me you slipped in the rain. It must have been miserable out there.""


Chapter 5 Watching Her Unravel
Patience faded on Marilee's face as she waited for a reaction, but Alexia wouldn't even meet her eyes. Instead, she directed her attention to Roger. ""Is the Gibson fortune going up in flames? This is all I'm worth?""

A shadow crossed Roger's face. ""That's what the prenup says, so that's all you're entitled to.""

Even before they got married, he'd closed every door to the family's fortune, making sure she'd never find a loophole. 

Realizing Alexia was blatantly ignoring her, Marilee butted in, ""You're getting more than enough, Alexia. Was it love or money you wanted from Roger, anyway?""

Alexia still refused to acknowledge her, not so much as a glance. ""With an amount this pitiful? Hang on to it--you'll need every last cent when the Gibson empire falls apart.""

Those words wiped any patience from Roger's face. ""Don't push it, Alexia.""

Suddenly, Marilee's eyes shimmered with tears and her voice went brittle, as though her heart might break. ""Please, Alexia, don't do this to Roger,"" she whimpered. 

The crowd's attention snapped toward her as sobs and sniffles filled the space. 

Marilee reached for the delicate pink diamond at her throat. ""Maybe you never knew, but Roger and I have loved each other for years. He gave me this necklace on your wedding day--it's a symbol of his devotion. That cherry blossom garden in your backyard? Roger built it just for me, hoping I'd smile. You stole my life. Everything you have should have been mine. Don't you think it's time you let go and left quietly, without asking for more?""

An uncomfortable hush settled over the room. 

It was rare to see a mistress acting so brazenly, demanding the wife walk away with empty hands. 

Finally, Alexia turned to meet Marilee's eyes, her voice colder than ice. ""I stole your life? Was it me who went to the Jenkins family, begging them to accept me? Was I the one who refused a DNA test and strutted around calling myself their true daughter? Did I chase after Roger, desperate for a marriage?""

Every pointed question shattered the silence, each one sharp enough to cut. 

All color drained from Marilee's face, her body rigid beneath Alexia's icy stare. Not missing a beat, Alexia delivered the final blow. ""Go blame your own foolish parents.""

That snapped the last of Marilee's restraint. ""If it weren't for them, you'd still be digging through ga**age. You've been living a luxurious life for twenty years. Without them, you'd be nothing but a pauper.""

A sharp laugh spilled from Alexia. Her gaze drifted to the faded needle marks on her wrist. ""If this is what luxury looks like, I must have missed out. Pain, though? There was always enough of that to go around.""

Disbelief filled Marilee's eyes, her words trembling with contempt. ""Lies. You grew up surrounded by filth--you're nothing but ga**age. If my parents hadn't stepped in, you'd be gone by now. Some gang would have had its way with you and left you in the gutter--""

The rest never left her mouth. A sharp slap rang out, echoing in the room. 

Stunned, Marilee pressed trembling fingers to the swelling red mark, speechless. 

A cold smile curved Alexia's lips. ""There's nothing I despise more than people who never learned basic decency. The Jenkins family or not, I'd still be standing here as myself. But you? Without that divorce agreement, you're nothing more than a shameless mistress.""

Not waiting for a reaction, Alexia hurled the signed divorce agreement straight at Marilee, landing the hit with brutal precision. ""Think of it as my parting gift.""

Marilee flinched as the edges nicked her forehead, letting out a startled cry. The shock left her shaking, the color draining from her lips. 

Alexia watched the panic unraveling Marilee's composure, noticing the nervous twitch on her face. Pretending to care, she cocked her head and offered, ""Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?""

That question broke whatever restraint Marilee had left. ""Why would you ever do that?"" she snapped. 

Alexia gave her a look laced with fake concern. ""It just seems like you're not well at all.""

Marilee's voice cracked as she screamed, ""I am not sick!""

Even Roger turned, uncertain and uneasy as her shrill denial filled the room. 

Unbothered, Alexia let her reply drip with venom, hitting every nerve. ""Funny. People who are actually unwell always insist they're fine. Might be time to book yourself a session with a psychiatrist. And before I forget...cute necklace. But honestly? Junk stones aren't worth much these days.""

Marilee's face turned ashen, her fury and humiliation overwhelming her. Without warning, she collapsed straight into Roger's arms. 

Anger carved hard lines into Roger's face as he pulled Marilee close, glaring at Alexia. ""I never realized you could be so cruel. Just because you wore my ring, you think you can say whatever you want?""

Before Alexia could offer a comeback, a familiar voice cut through the tension, heavy with mockery. ""Really? That's your angle? Just because she wore your ring, you think you could speak to her like that?""

A collective g**p swept through the crowd, all attention snapping to the doorway. There, tall and dangerously handsome, a man entered, charm radiating effortlessly with every step.

I can't eat anything without experiencing a major bloating episode an hour or so later. My intestines get loud and gurgle a lot. I dont know what's causing it. Im guessing dairy might have something to do with it. Im not having any diarrhea with it either. In fact, my bowel movements are mostly normal outside of some floating stool. It's so bad I stopped taking psyllium husk until the bloating eases. The bloating is the worst at night, sometimes its so bad I can't sleep.It eases somewhat when I lay on my left side. I also have bad anxiety, which seems to make the symptoms so much worse. Do any of you deal with this? Does it go away? And if not, is there anything I can take to help with this?

They’ve always been close so I’m tying to get closer. We all met up today for coffee and I think I screwed up. One of the girls is black (for context) and she hated me in middle school bc of rumors our friend group made about me that she believed. So like we’re not besties or anything but we don’t hate each other. Like it’s all good. But at the meet up today, that girl (I’ll call her Z) was there and another girl was asking me if I knew this guy from our ortho, and I was like, “omgsh the black guy?” and when I said black I looked over at Z. And so they all bursted out laughing and I was like “no omgsh I’m so sorry that’s now how I meant it I just didn’t know if it was social acceptable” (mind you I am whiteee like the rest of us) and they just kept laughing so I laughed with them bc.. I’d rather laugh with them then them laughing at me. So later I apologized to Z and she was like “no it’s really okay it was funny” but I don’t think it was.. later one of the other girls was like “omgsh the white one??” And they all laughed. Idk. I texted Z a little bit ago after the meet up and this was the convo:

Me: Hi! Today was fun. Just wanted to say, I truly am so sorry if what I said came off wrong. I wasn’t if it was actually funny or just awkward and made you uncomfortable, I totally understand either way
Z: hi! it was fun. thanks for apologizing, i understand you didnt mean it that way, im not upset.  and i appreciate you reaching out! have a good night :)
Me: Okay, thank you. Of course! Hopefully we can all hang out again sometime. You as well!

And then that was it 😭 I can’t tell if she’s mad or if she thinks I’m racist but I promise I’m not. In my town there’s just not that many black people (ofc we’re not like… al white 😭) but I just don’t know a ton.

He has since apologized and said he basically wants me back and to see if things would work out again between us. We had been together for 6 years before. When I met up with him it was weird. We had been talking for months now about meeting up. I felt indifferent I think, but it could be my walls are up and it’s my way of coping. He asked if I had fun while we were in his car and he hugged me at the beginning and when we were leaving. 

We haven’t texted each other at all and I’m just wondering what this means. Maybe he’s processing his emotions just like I am. I’m not exactly sure how I feel but I have a hard time processing my emotions about most things, so I’m not sure if I feel indifferent about him or the stressful situation.

The boss of my company keeps making comments about my haircut and appearance, often in front of others, and it's gone from tolerable to humiliating. I’m mid-30s, mid-level management, and dress professionally (but not conventionally corporate). I thought about asking him to lunch to build rapport, but my partner thinks that’s risky. I’m hesitant to go to HR. What should I do?

I had an interaction today with the boss of my company that felt like the last straw, and I’m not sure how to handle it without risking my standing or making things worse. It's a large company (~250 in the office), I have been here 7 years, and worked my way up from entry level to a mid-management role. The boss is in his 50s, well-known in the industry, very charismatic, and has a kind of ""businessman/broker-type” presence. I’ve tried to click with him. But our interactions feel off, like he doesn’t like me, and honestly the feeling is probably mutual. I don’t mesh well with big egos.

Over the years, I’ve had maybe 10-12 brief interactions with him, all of which have been in passing at common areas in the office. In 8-10 of those, he’s made a comment about either my haircut or clothes. Nothing vulgar, but things like “wow, that’s some haircut” or “another haircut already?” Never a compliment, never anything substantive. At first I brushed it off as awkward banter. But as time passed, it started to feel more like low-level picking.

For context: I’m mid-30s, male-presenting, dress business casual (polos/dress shirts, dress pants, leather shoes), have visible tattoos, gauged ears, and a clean beard. My hair is shaved tight on the sides with a slicked-back Mohawk style. I keep it very tidy.

Lately, the comments have been more frequent. Three comments in the last 6 weeks. And the last straw occurred recently while I was in a meeting with internal and external stakeholders joining online. The boss stopped by the meeting room, walked in, and interrupted the meeting to make a comment to the whole room about my ""bold haircut,"" then asked a senior colleague what he thought about it. I gave a polite brush-off as usual, but it honestly felt humiliating.

After that, I decided I wanted to deal with it. My plan was to ask for a quick 1:1 with him, acknowledge that we don’t really know each other, and then invite him to grab lunch or coffee to try to build some rapport and see if I could change the tone between us. I messaged him asking for a quick chat but haven’t heard back yet.

I told my partner about the idea when ingot home from work, and she thinks I should avoid a private meeting like that. She’s worried it could backfire or be twisted if it’s just the two of us. I don’t think he’s malicious, but I also feel weird going to HR because I can’t see how that conversation ends well, and I don’t want to be labeled as sensitive or difficult.
I don’t know what his issue is. Is it me, my style, or what. But I’m feeling worn down and unsure of how to proceed. Any advice?",1,1753946670.0,AskHR,0,1.0,False

First one to ha long back with cozy vietnam travels. The guide phing ( Frank ) was very knowledgeable, funny and an intriguing figure. He made the day trip full of fun.

Second trip also with cozy vietnam travels was to ninh binh, hoa lu, trang an. The guide thanh was well versed with the history of viet nam.

Story :

Chapter 1 The Fake Daughter Loses Everything
""Mrs. Gibson, do you have anything to say about your husband showing up at Marilee Jenkins' birthday party today and announcing that he's going to divorce you?""

""People are saying Marilee is Mr. Gibson's first love and the real daughter of your parents, while you're the fake. You've been enjoying her parents' love all this time and married to the man meant for her. Do you feel bad about that?""

""Your parents just said you're not really their daughter and cut off your money. You've been out of work for two years, living as a housewife, so how exactly do you plan to support yourself now? Mrs. Gibson, any comments?""

The birthday party was crowded, and Alexia Gibson found herself completely trapped. 

Reporters quickly closed in on her, pushing cameras and microphones into her face as camera flashes burst from every direction, giving her no space to breathe. 

Alexia just stood there, frozen. Her mind was still spinning from everything she'd just heard. 

So this Marilee Jenkins was the real daughter of her so-called parents and her husband's true love. 

And her? She was Roger Gibson's wife on paper, but clearly, just a joke to everyone else. 

Years ago, the Jenkins couple had pulled her out of some run-down neighborhood overseas, saying she was their long-lost daughter. 

But had they really not bothered doing a simple DNA test before welcoming her in? 

Why did they only discover the mistake now? 

Alexia's body tensed up. Her eyes drifted over to the man standing next to her. However, Roger's attention was not on her. He was looking at Marilee, as if they were the only ones in the room. 

Her voice came out strained as she asked, ""Why? You didn't even tell me.""

Roger's face was as cold as stone. ""Now you know. That's all that matters. It's over, Alexia. You were never good enough for me. Our marriage? Just a transaction. The only woman I've ever loved is Marilee. And you know why I never touched you after the wedding? Because you disgust me. You're like a spoiled dish--completely unappetizing.""

His eyes swept over her from head to toe, full of scorn. Her simple clothes, those outdated glasses--everything about her clashed with the glossy, high-class world he lived in. 

Before his harsh words even fully sank in, Alexia lifted her glass and threw the champagne right into his face. 

The drink hit him with a loud splash, soaking his face and pricey suit. He just stood there, stunned, as the liquid dripped from his hair and down his face. 

""A spoiled dish? You told me you wanted an ordinary housewife. Dad and Mom told me they wanted an obedient daughter, who never outdid anyone!""

Without hesitation, she threw the glass to the floor. The sharp crash instantly silenced the whole room. 

Roger's face turned red with embarrassment. His jaw tightened. ""Have you lost your mind?""

From the stage, the Jenkins couple yelled at her. ""Alexia, this is Marilee's birthday, not a place for your drama!""

People in the crowd rolled their eyes and muttered that she was nuts. 

None of them had a clue what she had given up for the two families all these years. 

Shoving through the crowd, Alexia made a beeline for the exit. Reporters swarmed after her like a flood. 

She shoved past them all, blind to the pouring rain, deaf to the murmurs and judgment surrounding her. Right now, all she wanted was to get away--far from the noise, the eyes, and the humiliation. 

But just as she broke through the crowd and made it outside, a bunch of Marilee's wild fans shoved her hard, and she slipped, landing on the wet road. 

Marilee was an A-list star in showbiz. Her birthday party was being livestreamed, and tons of fans had gathered outside. The second they saw Alexia step out, the crowd lost it, shouting like wild animals who had just found something to attack. 

""Alexia, you've got some nerve attending Marilee's birthday party. You've got no shame!""

""You're not even the real daughter. Just go back to whatever dump you came from, or are you too hooked on the Jenkins' money?""

""Roger's going to divorce you, and you still think it's okay to show your face around Marilee? Who do you think you are?""

""Go away already!""

Alexia lay there on the wet street, frozen for a second, while their nasty words echoed all around her. 

She let out a dry, bitter laugh. Everything was such a joke. A broken marriage, a cold family, and now they'd left her completely humiliated. 

What was the point of pretending for so long? She had kept her head down, put up with everything, and this was what she got in the end? 

A wave of helplessness washed over her. She closed her eyes, not even caring anymore as the freezing rain drenched her. 

Through the noise and chaos, a flattering voice broke through. ""Mr. Mason."" The polite greeting was followed by firm, steady footsteps coming closer in the rain. 

Moments later, a black umbrella appeared above her, silently cutting through the rain and offering her shelter from the storm. 


Chapter 2 Meeting Him Again At Her Absolute Worst
Alexia slowly looked up and met a sharp, intense gaze. 

The streetlights flickered in the rain. Waylon Mason stood there, tall and intimidating, with a strong presence that made people uncomfortable. 

Behind him was a row of fancy cars parked along the street, catching everyone's eye. 

His assistants were standing on both sides of him, and one was holding an umbrella over his head. 

But the umbrella Waylon was holding was tilted just to cover Alexia. 

Waylon took a slow step forward and leaned in. Before she could react, his fingers reached up and removed the heavy, black-rimmed glasses from her face. Her bright, beautiful eyes were now fully visible. 

He looked down at her with a smirk. ""It's been years, Alexia. Look at you--what a mess. Did you finally stop being that love-crazy girl, or are you still dreaming useless dreams?""

Every word cut deeper. Alexia's eyes started to tear up, and the little bit of strength she had left broke down under his harsh voice. 

She opened her mouth to retort, but before she could speak, Waylon suddenly picked her up in his arms in front of everyone, protecting her from the rain and everything around them. 

He walked toward the black car waiting nearby, carrying her as the bodyguards quickly stepped aside to make way. 

All the noise and the rude comments around them faded away. 

Everyone just stood there, stunned, watching them leave with shock written all over their faces. 

...

Inside the car, Alexia held onto her muddy, soaked dress with trembling hands. 

She looked down, her voice rough. ""Waylon, why'd you have to show up now?""

Why now...when everything in her life was falling apart? 

Waylon tilted his head at her question, then reached out and took her chin in his hand, gently but firmly lifting her face. His voice was calm, yet carried a cold edge. ""Why else? I came to check on the woman I liked the least.""

His eyes darkened, a smirk playing on his lips. ""So, Alexia, do you remember what I said to you seven years ago?""

Of course she did. 

Waylon was the golden child of the Mason family. Her biggest rival back in the day. 

The last time they met was at the airport, seven years ago. What was meant to be a goodbye turned into their worst fight. 

Waylon always hated how she begged for the Jenkins family's approval and how she held onto Roger like she had no pride. And she couldn't stand his ego and how he judged everyone she cared about. 

Back then, he'd warned her clearly--chasing approval from people who'd never truly accept her would only end in disappointment, leaving her with nothing in the end. 

But she was too hopeful to see it. She had told herself, ""It's okay if they don't like me now. If I work hard and put them first, they'll accept me eventually.""

They wanted her to marry Roger, so she agreed. Her brothers didn't want her getting too powerful, so she acted clueless and average. But behind the scenes, she was quietly taking out their threats and protecting both the Jenkins and the Gibson families. 

As Waylon's fingers held her jaw tightly, her warm tears fell on his hand, running down his knuckles. His expression wavered. The coldness faded just for a second. Then, he let go. 

Alexia's voice shook, still raspy from the rain. ""Waylon, you were right. They tossed me aside after exploiting me. For more than twenty years, I gave them everything I had. I was so st**id.""

It was a long time before Waylon finally spoke again. ""You were not st**id. They just weren't worth it.""

But Alexia didn't respond. 

He turned to look at her and saw her fast asleep. 

Later that night, Alexia suddenly came down with a high fever. 

Santino Blake, Waylon's personal doctor, got pulled out of bed by a single call and had to grab his stuff and rush over late at night. 

With his years of experience, Santino quickly ran a full checkup. He stood by the bed, looking at Alexia's pale, tired face, and let out a soft sigh. 


Chapter 3 Our Luna Is Back
Santino glanced over his shoulder and caught sight of Waylon on the balcony, cigarette burning slowly between his fingers. 

Sm**e curled up in lazy spirals, casting a ghostly veil over Waylon's sharp features, softening them with each exhale. 

Waylon rarely smoked. Santino could only recall one other time Waylon had smoked like this--two years ago. 

Santino stepped outside and joined him. ""She's stable now. She just picked up a chill from being stuck in the rain and took the shock pretty hard. I've given her an injection and some medication--she'll be all right.""

A brief pause allowed Santino to scan the night sky. ""I checked the headlines. The Jenkins family didn't just cut her off; they humiliated her for everyone to see--right in the middle of Marilee's birthday party.""

Anger edged into Santino's voice. ""Hadn't they done a DNA test before taking her back from abroad? This whole thing smells like a setup.""

A sudden vibration broke his focus--Alexia's phone was buzzing on the nightstand. 

Waylon strode inside, intent on ending the call, but the name flashing on the screen stopped him cold. A flicker of something dark flashed across his eyes as he picked up and put on the speaker. 

Shouting erupted instantly, the caller's anger unmistakable. 

""Alexia, you've ignored every call and message. What exactly are you trying to pull? Faking your own disappearance won't help. Tomorrow, you're signing the divorce agreement, and that's the end of it. I've shown enough patience. Stop standing in the way of Marilee and me. You've lived off the Jenkins family long enough. If you have any dignity left, walk away for good--it's the least you can do for Marilee. Don't worry about your share--you'll get what's coming. You looked after my grandmother and my mother these past years, fine. But don't overstep. Learn when to quit. Why aren't you answering me? Where are you?""

The stillness that lingered on the line finally made Roger uneasy. His confidence wavered and his words lost their edge. 

Santino internally begged for someone to step in and stop what was happening, feeling panic surge as things slipped further from control. 

From the moment Roger started speaking, Santino caught the way Waylon's face darkened. His eyes went cold and every hint of warmth vanished, leaving the atmosphere icy and suffocating. Santino could barely stand, knees threatening to give way. 

Waylon's expression turned sharp, his smile edged with cruelty. ""So that's the way you speak to her, huh?""

Every muscle in Roger's body tensed, instincts screaming a warning. His voice grew cautious. ""Who are you? Where is Alexia?""

Waylon let his gaze settle on the bed, where Alexia rested, her breathing faint but even. His response came as a gentle murmur, almost lost in the tension. ""She's asleep.""

He let a short silence hang before adding, ""And she's right here with me.""

The only thing that answered him was the explosive sound of rage through the phone. Roger's voice thundered down the line. ""What did you just say? Who are you?""

Amusement glimmered in Waylon's eyes as a low chuckle slipped out. ""Relax. You'll figure it out...assuming you live long enough."" Without another word, he ended the call. 

By morning, the rain had vanished, leaving sunlight streaming through the windows as Alexia stirred awake. 

She reached for her phone, greeted by a storm of missed calls and furious messages from Roger. 

Without reacting, she scrolled through the flood of texts, then let the device drop onto the sheets. Right now, a hot shower mattered more. 

Steam fogged the bathroom mirror as she faced her reflection. Something had changed--her eyes, once dull, now held a spark she hadn't seen in ages. 

For the first time in ages, she tried out a smile, and this one actually reached her eyes, genuine and alive. 

It felt like a fever had burned away all her confusion, stripping her heart of old pain and foolish loyalty to those who never deserved it. 

No more playing the fool. No more pretending everything was fine. This sad story was over. 

Wrapped in a towel after the shower, she scanned her contacts and paused on a name untouched for years. 

Her call barely rang once before chaos exploded on the other end. ""Luna! It's about d**n time! Tell me--are the rumors true? You're finally getting a divorce?""

Laughter and shouting burst from the background, her friends making no attempt to hide their eavesdropping. 

Alexia replied calmly, ""Yes, I'm going to sign the divorce agreement today.""

Celebration roared through the phone. Whistles, cheers, the clink of glasses--her friends were clearly turning it into a full-blown party. 

""Took you long enough to snap out of that trance! No more housewife blues. Our Luna is back!""

""Divorce is the best thing to happen to you! Roger never deserved you. Say the word and I'll handle him myself!""

""And don't get me started on that overrated Jenkins family. If not for you, they'd have collapsed during last year's crash. Luna, we're ready when you are--the Helix Consortium stands with you.""

Their laughter and support brought a genuine grin to Alexia's lips. ""In that case, I need a ride.""

Without missing a beat, a man's voice broke in, buzzing with excitement. ""A ride? For your grand return? Name it. I'll send the reigning racing champion to pick you up!""


Chapter 4 Do You Believe Me
The call had barely ended when the soft click of the door caught Alexia's attention, her head snapping up. 

There in the doorway stood Waylon, his height casting a shadow, his expression giving nothing away as their eyes met. 

Neither of them had anticipated this kind of encounter. 

Fresh from the shower, Alexia's hair clung damply to her cheeks, a robe slipping low on her shoulders, skin flushed and eyes still hazy with warmth. 

That oversized bathrobe, threatening to slip further, revealed soft lines of skin; the faint scent of shampoo lingered in the air, sweet and impossible to ignore. 

Waylon's gaze swept over her, lingering just long enough for her cheeks to flush, before he looked away calmly. ""Get ready. Breakfast is on the table.""

Moments later, Alexia emerged dressed, met by the aroma of a beautifully arranged breakfast. Hunger won out over pride; she took her seat without pretense, finishing most of the meal before pausing for breath. 

Little was said as Waylon let her eat in peace, only breaking the silence after she'd nearly cleared her plate. ""You need a lawyer?""

She set down her coffee cup, eyes meeting his squarely. ""So you've heard.""

Amusement tugged at his mouth, though his eyes stayed cold. ""Is there anyone left who doesn't?""

Alexia tasted the bitterness of the coffee and grimaced for just a moment, though she quickly composed herself. ""I can deal with it.""

As the words left her mouth, she realized he might think she was too stubborn to admit she needed help. After all, in most people's eyes, women being dumped were pathetic. 

""Do you believe me when I say that?"" she asked. 

A smirk played on Waylon's face, eyes narrowing with a knowing glint. ""Why wouldn't I? Alexia, he's the one who should've fallen apart.""

That unwavering gaze held her still, though she managed a small, genuine smile in return. ""You've always known how to make a good point.""

Once breakfast was done, Alexia got ready to leave. 

Reaching the doorway, she stopped and glanced back. ""Thank you,"" she said quietly, her gratitude unmistakable. 

There was no chance she'd forget his kindness. 

...

Ten minutes had ticked past their appointment, and Roger's patience was quickly wearing thin as he and Marilee waited for Alexia in a private club. 

""Why isn't she here yet? Is she refusing to divorce you?"" Marilee pressed herself closer to him, sugar in her tone as she pouted. ""You haven't forgotten our shopping plans, right? You promised you'd buy me a gown after this.""

Roger hummed in response. The weekend's banquet held by the Chamber of Commerce would be the perfect stage to introduce Marilee--the timing of her comeback couldn't have been more ideal. Every influential name in town would be present, all eyes fixed on Waylon's much-anticipated return. 

Just thinking about Waylon sent a flicker of unease across Roger's face. 

The Chamber of Commerce's open support for Waylon right before the election of its new president wasn't exactly good news for the Gibson family. 

A sudden uproar near the doorway snapped Roger's focus. 

His head turned, and in that instant, it felt as though the atmosphere in the room shifted. 

Everyone's attention zeroed in on a single figure gliding inside with effortless grace. 

Alexia walked in, her crimson dress hugging every curve, heels whispering over the polished floor. Each stride radiated poise and quiet confidence. The scarlet hue, that unmistakable glow--she looked like the sunrise brought to life. 

With each step Alexia took, Marilee's smile grew tighter, until it disappeared altogether when Alexia claimed the seat across from them. 

Roger couldn't hide his shock either; his eyes remained glued to Alexia's artfully made-up features. 

""You..."" Words caught in his throat, visible in the small, nervous bob of his Adam's apple. 

Nobody present could believe this woman was the same person from last night--the awkward glasses, the baggy checkered shirt, the sopping hair. 

Yesterday's pitiful girl had been replaced by someone utterly different, confident, unrecognizable. 

Nothing about their surprise caught Alexia off guard. Her beauty wasn't news to her; she'd just chosen not to make a show of it. Childhood lessons had always emphasized modesty, staying out of the spotlight, never inviting too much notice. 

Marriage only tightened the leash. Years spent tending to Roger's grandmother and fielding disapproval from a mother-in-law who'd been fed tales of her so-called wild youth. 

Not even her hair or the color of her clothes escaped scrutiny. Every detail had been censored into drab submission. 

Vibrant dresses never made it to her closet--only baggy, forgettable options filled the shelves. 

That chapter, though, was behind her. 

With unhurried confidence, Alexia called over a server, ordered a tequila, and began paging through the divorce agreement--unfazed by the attention. 

Marilee recovered her composure first, flashing a sweet smile. ""Alexia, I hope you're alright after yesterday. The reporters caught us all off guard. Someone told me you slipped in the rain. It must have been miserable out there.""


Chapter 5 Watching Her Unravel
Patience faded on Marilee's face as she waited for a reaction, but Alexia wouldn't even meet her eyes. Instead, she directed her attention to Roger. ""Is the Gibson fortune going up in flames? This is all I'm worth?""

A shadow crossed Roger's face. ""That's what the prenup says, so that's all you're entitled to.""

Even before they got married, he'd closed every door to the family's fortune, making sure she'd never find a loophole. 

Realizing Alexia was blatantly ignoring her, Marilee butted in, ""You're getting more than enough, Alexia. Was it love or money you wanted from Roger, anyway?""

Alexia still refused to acknowledge her, not so much as a glance. ""With an amount this pitiful? Hang on to it--you'll need every last cent when the Gibson empire falls apart.""

Those words wiped any patience from Roger's face. ""Don't push it, Alexia.""

Suddenly, Marilee's eyes shimmered with tears and her voice went brittle, as though her heart might break. ""Please, Alexia, don't do this to Roger,"" she whimpered. 

The crowd's attention snapped toward her as sobs and sniffles filled the space. 

Marilee reached for the delicate pink diamond at her throat. ""Maybe you never knew, but Roger and I have loved each other for years. He gave me this necklace on your wedding day--it's a symbol of his devotion. That cherry blossom garden in your backyard? Roger built it just for me, hoping I'd smile. You stole my life. Everything you have should have been mine. Don't you think it's time you let go and left quietly, without asking for more?""

An uncomfortable hush settled over the room. 

It was rare to see a mistress acting so brazenly, demanding the wife walk away with empty hands. 

Finally, Alexia turned to meet Marilee's eyes, her voice colder than ice. ""I stole your life? Was it me who went to the Jenkins family, begging them to accept me? Was I the one who refused a DNA test and strutted around calling myself their true daughter? Did I chase after Roger, desperate for a marriage?""

Every pointed question shattered the silence, each one sharp enough to cut. 

All color drained from Marilee's face, her body rigid beneath Alexia's icy stare. Not missing a beat, Alexia delivered the final blow. ""Go blame your own foolish parents.""

That snapped the last of Marilee's restraint. ""If it weren't for them, you'd still be digging through ga**age. You've been living a luxurious life for twenty years. Without them, you'd be nothing but a pauper.""

A sharp laugh spilled from Alexia. Her gaze drifted to the faded needle marks on her wrist. ""If this is what luxury looks like, I must have missed out. Pain, though? There was always enough of that to go around.""

Disbelief filled Marilee's eyes, her words trembling with contempt. ""Lies. You grew up surrounded by filth--you're nothing but ga**age. If my parents hadn't stepped in, you'd be gone by now. Some gang would have had its way with you and left you in the gutter--""

The rest never left her mouth. A sharp slap rang out, echoing in the room. 

Stunned, Marilee pressed trembling fingers to the swelling red mark, speechless. 

A cold smile curved Alexia's lips. ""There's nothing I despise more than people who never learned basic decency. The Jenkins family or not, I'd still be standing here as myself. But you? Without that divorce agreement, you're nothing more than a shameless mistress.""

Not waiting for a reaction, Alexia hurled the signed divorce agreement straight at Marilee, landing the hit with brutal precision. ""Think of it as my parting gift.""

Marilee flinched as the edges nicked her forehead, letting out a startled cry. The shock left her shaking, the color draining from her lips. 

Alexia watched the panic unraveling Marilee's composure, noticing the nervous twitch on her face. Pretending to care, she cocked her head and offered, ""Do you need me to call an ambulance for you?""

That question broke whatever restraint Marilee had left. ""Why would you ever do that?"" she snapped. 

Alexia gave her a look laced with fake concern. ""It just seems like you're not well at all.""

Marilee's voice cracked as she screamed, ""I am not sick!""

Even Roger turned, uncertain and uneasy as her shrill denial filled the room. 

Unbothered, Alexia let her reply drip with venom, hitting every nerve. ""Funny. People who are actually unwell always insist they're fine. Might be time to book yourself a session with a psychiatrist. And before I forget...cute necklace. But honestly? Junk stones aren't worth much these days.""

Marilee's face turned ashen, her fury and humiliation overwhelming her. Without warning, she collapsed straight into Roger's arms. 

Anger carved hard lines into Roger's face as he pulled Marilee close, glaring at Alexia. ""I never realized you could be so cruel. Just because you wore my ring, you think you can say whatever you want?""

Before Alexia could offer a comeback, a familiar voice cut through the tension, heavy with mockery. ""Really? That's your angle? Just because she wore your ring, you think you could speak to her like that?""

A collective g**p swept through the crowd, all attention snapping to the doorway. There, tall and dangerously handsome, a man entered, charm radiating effortlessly with every step.

Before I say anything, a bit of context about myself, I (26) grew up in a messy and chaotic household, so I’m acclimated to mess more than the average person, and as an adult, I struggle with executive dysfunction, ADHD, and depression. I moved out at 21 because my living situation got too terrible to handle, and I thought I would be much better at adulting by now, but I’m struggling. This doesn’t excuse my “crimes,” haha, but I hope explains where I’m coming from.

My roommate (29) and I have had our fair share of tiffs in the past; he’s a pretty clean and methodical person. I’ve gotten better at doing certain things to his standards to minimize conflict, like washing dishes immediately after cooking rather than waiting until later. This was a big issue when he moved in.

But there are some other things I want to get better at, but it feels like I’m at war with myself.

Around the house, I’m really struggling with tidiness. Specifically clutter. I don’t leave trash around, but I have a bad habit of leaving behind my books, notebooks, cords, etc. in communal spaces like on the coffee table or dining table. And, frustratingly, if it gets moved into my room, it just becomes clutter in there, until I rally myself to clean up once a month.

I am taking medications, but I’m currently stuck in a feedback loop where I forget to take my meds, which causes me to become more depressed/dysfunctional, and makes me forget to take my meds more.

I’m want badly to be a better roommate and adult. How do I combat this “clutter blindness” and executive dysfunction? I’ve tried every tip in the book: setting timers, writing reminders, having organizer bins, designating specific places for things, etc., and it all makes me want to pull my hair out or outright doesn’t work. (Don’t underestimate my ability to ignore a phone alarm, despite my best efforts.)

I’m hoping others who struggle with forgetfulness, mental illness, and clutter blindness might have some practical advice for me.

I texted her: “Hey, did you leave an earring behind?”

She replied:
“I don’t have pierced ears.”

That’s when I noticed the earring wasn’t silver… it was something else. Warmer. Older. Almost ancient. And my phone’s screen started glitching whenever I touched it.

1mduvma,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1mduvma/managing_your_worklife_onceif_you_are_stuck_in/,"Managing your work-life once/if you are ""stuck"" in Corporate","I have followed ""antiwork"" for a while now - and while I 100% agree with its underlying mentality, to me it seems that many people approach this with a somewhat counterproductive, destructive or outright hostile mindset. Meaning, in a way that is detrimental primarily to yourself.

I am 40 years old and have somewhat managed to settle into my role (inhouse corporate legal). I have met some backlash and insults while posting here, with several people claiming that I’m more or less also “part of the problem” feeding into the system etc and I wanted to share a bit of a my perspective:

My mindset has always been based on the following: the Company, Corporate, Management, etc. do not care one bit about you as a person. Nobody cares that you exist. The sooner you learn and accept this, the better. Just two weeks ago we had a management call where an employee complained about people quitting in his department saying that they felt not properly compensated for their work. The CEO outright said that they are constantly evaluating if people are paid according to “market standards” and will adjust pay if they learn that “the market” pays more for certain roles than they themselves. This perfectly encapsulates the corporate management mindset. A corporation will always pay you exactly the \*minimum\* that they can get away with and not one cent more. You give your everything, innovate, make the company tons of money? You will still only get a salary and \*maybe\* a one-off bonus that is exactly the minimum to barely make you not quit on the spot. You will never receive a fair contribution that is equal to the value you have created.

Now you can cry about this on the internet for years. Or you could also adjust your own mindset based on that. The company is trying to get the maximum amount of work from me for the minimum amount of money? Ok. Then I will try to get the maximum amount of money for the minimum amount of work/effort. A simple equilibrium. This mindset is sometimes decried as “quiet quitting” which is of course ridiculous. It just means to deliver the amount of work that you are compensated for – and nothing more. If you pay a carpenter to build you a chair, you will get exactly that. A chair. You will not get two chairs. And you certainly won’t get an additional table for free, because he wants to show “motivation and engagement”.

What, you ask, is the point of this wall of text, what does this actually mean in practice? It means shifting your focus away from the best interests of the company towards the best interests of yourself in your role at the company. The company wants you to be “engaged”? Then I will mimic engagement. Last Friday a senior project manager wrote me an e-mail at 7 pm and I was “happy” to jump on a quick call with him. Little did he know that I already went to the gym at noon, took a nap after lunch, did my grocery shopping and laundry later. Because I was working from home.

Nature uses hypnotic rhythm to make one’s dominating thoughts and one’s thought-habits permanent. That is why poverty is disease. Nature makes it so by fixing permanently the thought-habits of all who accept poverty as an unavoidable circumstance.”






this hypnotic rhythm becomes a built-in, automated part of our lives via a three-step process of 1) action; 2) habit; 3) rhythm. Actions, including our thoughts, are the things we do that we have complete control over. We consciously decide whether or not these actions come into being. When we repeat the actions long enough, they become habits, the things that we do to give us our daily momentum and help us feel safe and comfortable as we navigate life. It’s possible for us to stray from these habits, but as they become more and more solidified in our lives, we tend to repeatedly return to them.
If those habits are repeated long enough, they then become —you guessed it—a hypnotic rhythm. This is when the habit becomes a part of what we are on a phenomenological level. In other words, those habits become linked to our identity and how we define ourselves. For example, I simply am that person who gets up at 6 am to go on a morning jog, vs., God forbid, occasionally staying in bed and making love to my spouse. I am that person who drinks black coffee every morning so that I maintain my strict intermittent fasting protocol day-in and day-out, though that matcha green tea with coconut oil and stevia recipe looks like a fun little change-up. I am that person who slips away after dinner to read a book in my office, though my kids really want to go outside and stargaze. These habits eventually get put on subconscious autopilot, and at that point, the actions associated with each habit require basically no willpower at all. At this stage, we may find that we have almost no control over those very actions, whether they produce good or bad fruit in our lives.





If those habits are repeated long enough, they then become —you guessed it—a hypnotic rhythm. This is when the habit becomes a part of what we are on a phenomenological level. In other words, those habits become linked to our identity

Can you guys give me some advice about this shop.

As you can see there is a brimstone. 👀 

My first thought was buying juzu & brimstone and go hunting for apparitions since there are a lot events in act 2 and already have the feel no pain. I believe double tap, pummel and whirlwind are good attacks to get me through to find heavy blade and other attacks... Its sucks that i cant afford the DE, but i believe i am one offering away from destroying the apire. Maybe its cope...

Second option i considered is the dark embrace, remove, heavy blade and maybe ghostly armor or maybe chrysalis.. and continue hunting the events for bites (blood vile swap) or apperitions for coffee dripper boss relic. Idk

Armaments+ opens the option for a fusion hammer

Not against snecko because of the arma+, DE- impervious and whirlwind

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: Orix Buffaloes vs. Saitama Seibu Lions**  
*Because nothing says “baseball wisdom” like a rookie pitcher’s velocity joke and a team that’s finally stopped buffaloing itself.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The **Saitama Seibu Lions** are the heavy favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **-150 to -170** (implied probability: \~61–63%). That means bookmakers think they’re about as likely to win as a vegan at a steakhouse. Meanwhile, the **Orix Buffaloes**, the underdogs, sit at **+200 to +240** (implied probability: \~40–45%), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Yeah, they’re probably gonna lose, but if they don’t, you’ll get paid.”

The **spreads** are equally brutal: Seibu is -1.5 runs, while Orix is +1.5. For context, that’s like giving a toddler a 1.5-inch head start in a sprint against Usain Bolt. The **totals** are locked at **5.5 runs**, with even-money pricing. Given that the Buffaloes and Lions just played a 10-run game (Orix won 6-4), this “Under 5.5” line feels like asking a toddler to predict the weather—optimistic, but not exactly grounded in reality.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Teruishi’s Velocity, Miyagi’s Humility

The Buffaloes have a secret weapon: **Terunobu Teruishi**, their second-overall draft pick, who recently threw 155 km/h in an All-Star game. His postgame interview? A masterclass in rookie humility: *“I think I’ll be able to throw around 50 km/h,”* he joked. (Note: 50 km/h is about the speed of a sloth on a coffee break.) But let’s not dismiss him—his fastball is legit, and he’s eager to wear the team’s “super cool” red summer uniform. If he can avoid tripping over his own cleats, he might just outduel the Lions.

On the Seibu side? We’re mostly left with whispers. Their last start against Orix was a 6-

One minute you’re knee-deep in emails, the next it’s already evening and you wonder, “What did I actually accomplish today?” Time tracking software can be the friendly nudge that helps pull you out of that haze.

**1. See Where Your Hours Really Go**  
We’ve all been there—logging time in a spreadsheet, then realizing two hours vanished somewhere between Slack, coffee breaks, and that “quick” brainstorming chat. A simple tracker records every minute spent on projects or tasks, so you get honest data instead of guessing.

**2. Ditch Payday Headaches**  
Running payroll shouldn’t feel like a math final. With automated timers, your team clicks “start” and “stop,” and voilà—accurate timesheets ready for invoicing or payroll exports. No more chasing down missing entries or fixing typos.

**3. Keep Everyone on the Same Page, Even Remotely**  
It’s hard to trust someone’s work when you can’t peek over their cubicle. Shared time reports foster transparency without the ick of micromanagement. Whether folks are at home, on the road, or squeezed into a coffee shop, everyone knows who’s working on what.

**4. Make Smarter Business Calls**  
Curious if that new client project is bleeding profit? Billable vs. non-billable breakdowns help you spot trends, set fair rates, and tweak your service offerings, so you’re running on data, not hunches.

Tools like WebWork Time Tracker strike a good balance: task-level reports, distraction alerts, and exportable logs without burying you in menus. But there are plenty of options out there, from lightweight free apps to robust suites.

What’s your experience? Have you tried time tracking in your small biz (or freelance life), and did it really move the needle for you? Let’s swap stories and favorite tips for getting those precious hours back.",2,1753944873.0,TimeTrackingSoftware,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Yakult Swallows vs. Yokohama DeNA BayStars: A Parlay of Peril and Puns**

**Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams**  
The Tokyo Yakult Swallows (2.3 implied probability ≈ 43.5% chance to win) are the underdogs against the favored Yokohama DeNA BayStars (1.53 ≈ 65.3% implied). The spread favors DeNA -1.5 runs, while the total line sits at 6.5 runs. Yakult’s recent three-game winning streak, including a 2-1 victory over DeNA last month, is a glimmer of hope. But let’s not forget: their new pitcher, Aoyagi Koyo, has a minor league ERA of 7.22—roughly the same as a coffee machine attempting to pitch.

**Digesting the News: Gratitude, Grit, and Glaring Weaknesses**  
Aoyagi’s press conference was all smiles, but his stats tell a different story. The man who once dreamed of MLB glory now faces the NPB equivalent of a “reality check”—a 7.22 ERA in 23 games. Yakult GM Ogawa called his NPB experience “impressive,” which is like saying a leaky faucet is “moistly adequate.” Meanwhile, DeNA’s recent performance? They lost 2-1 to Yakult in their last meeting, but their manager’s postgame quote (“We played a great game”) sounds suspiciously like a motivational speech for a team that forgot how to score runs.

**Humorous Spin: Baseball as a Circus Act**  
Aoyagi’s journey from Hanshin to Yakult reads like a tragicomedy. “I failed to make it to the majors,” he said, “but now I’m here to help Yakult get stronger!” If “stronger” means “more likely to hemorrhage runs,” then yes, Aoyagi’s a powerhouse. His 7.22

1mdueoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDcirclejerk/comments/1mdueoo/my_friend_keeps_telling_me_my_character_isnt_good/,My friend keeps telling me my character isn't good because she's not a 'femme fatale' female character.,"Hiya. Just an unoriginal rant.

My friend and I were discussing some of our fav characters we've created, and then I put forward my character, saying I loved her because she was a great character and I love roleplaying her. She is a very alluring and controlling Tiefling sorlock - looks just like the type you see on okbuddybaldur. She's a very kind party member, and with approval from my DM, she doesn't harm anyone, just breaks their bones and gives them concussions.

My friend made a passing comment that my character isn't a femme fatale female character so she isn't interesting. I was quick to defend my character - she's not psychologically a manipulative character, however, she is quietly charismatic and constantly chooses to deceive men about dangers that lie in store (for context, she has 2 or 3 NPC followers going at all times and they gotta walk ahead for traps #osr4life). She's not fully trained, and is constantly learning and studying along the way during campaign but she easily tricks hardboiled detectives into trusting her and her party.

Don't get me wrong, she has flaws, like being kind and perhaps too mouthy - but she's got this character arch where she's lost aura and becomes very talkative and oversharing instead of her usual mysterious self and her party helps her to farm that aura back.

My friend, who is definitely real, still disagreed, telling me that I can't possibly think a strong femme fatale character does not even kiss with poisoned lipstick. We ended up arguing because to me, a femme fatale character doesn't need to be directly manipulative - I see that as being my ex. (Correction here - it isn't my ex if they are directly manipulative, it is when they also turn my entire friend group against me and take the best furniture from my apartment. For example, my good coffee maker).

Furthermore, I think watching her develop her enchantment is a million times more interesting - it leaves so much room for her to grow as a seductress.

Anyway - she isn't agreeing with me and refuses to even play in a one-shot I'm running because to quote 'ever time we talk you've found some stupid new indie system that you swear is better'.",4,1753944094.0,DnDcirclejerk,2,0.7,False

At the back of a rack, I found a midi skirt—plaid, a little faded, with a wonky hem that someone had clearly tried to fix themselves. It was $10, so I grabbed it on a whim.  

Turns out, it’s become my most-worn piece. I’ve paired it with a turtleneck and boots for coffee runs, dressed it up with a silk blouse for a friend’s dinner party, and even thrown a sweater over it for lazy Sundays. It’s not perfect—there’s a small tear near the pocket, and the waistband is a little loose—but that’s why I love it. It feels \*lived-in\*, like it’s already part of my story.  

Do you have a thrifted/old/imperfect piece that’s become a staple? What makes it special, even with its flaws? I’d love to hear your ""ugly duckling"" fashion wins. ",1,1753943970.0,WardrobeWanderers,0,1.0,False

They can't figure out what the buttons are and repeatedly try to press the screen, they fail a couple of times and then start to try to press the item description multiple times like it will eventually work, they press the buttons right once but for some reason go back to clicking the item description again.
I am forced to come to the rescue by myself because they fail to understand me explaining stuff and keep clicking whatever they want.

Then I go back to my register and they start asking me where they put the money in(The slot has a massive symbol and arrow pointing to it), I try again by giving instructions and they fail to understand, forcing me to again to have to do it myself.

It's 7:00 in the fucking morning, my knee hurts and then they have to complain that my attitude sucks after, motherfucker ofc it sucks walking hurts and I have to deal with your near infant ass asking me to come over every two seconds because you can't figure out a damn coffee machine.

New grad nurse—hating my life and having so many regrets.

I don’t even know where to start. I’m a new grad on orientation on a super busy med-surg floor, and I’ve only been given 12 shifts total to get up to speed. I’m on shift crying in the bathroom some days because I’m starting to seriously think I made the wrong choice.

The environment is cold. Most of the nurses around me don’t seem to care there is legit no empathy, no warmth, just drama and cliques!!!!! I love patients, and I’m good at building rapport. Academically I did great in school. I never had an issue with meds, patho or clinicals. But I’m realizing that what I can’t handle is not feeling safe.

Is 1:8 normal for nights?
Is 1:6 normal for days?
Because that’s what I’m dealing with—and it’s acc scaring me.

I’m constantly behind, missing little pieces of my assessments, and having to run in and out of rooms multiple times. Nothing is explained well, people aren’t doing things by the book, and it makes me so scared I’m going to chart something wrong and lose my license before I even start.

I feel trapped. I’m supposed to start school again in January for my RN, but even that is starting to feel shaky. I’ve always had a passion for mental health nursing, but one of my placements in that area was so toxic it acc made my brain hurt . my preceptor didn’t teach me anything even when I would advocate for my learning and ask to go on coffee chats for feedback etc. 

I had to teach myself everything: meds, MSEs, legal forms, all of it. That experience already dimmed my passion. Now this unsafe, chaotic med-surg unit is just… draining the rest.

I’m still technically on orientation, and I already have a horrible feeling about this floor. The vibes are off. I don’t feel supported. I don’t feel safe. I don’t feel like anyone genuinely cares about the patients.

TBH I’m scared I’m going to become like them. I don’t want to lose my compassion or my spark, but I can feel it slipping.

I’m trying to stick it out for at least 6 months, but I honestly don’t feel confident that I can make it that far. I don’t think it’s going to get better.

I would feel really guilty if I decided I don't like someone after they just bought me dinner.

However, I noticed that with the past 3 guys I went on 10+ dates with, I ended-up paying for myself the entire relationship. And actually, I ended up spending more than the guy. For example, I would see a snack that I remember he liked, and I would get it for him, but never reciprocated.

I am financially well-off (100% due to my career, no nepotism) and I know I out-earn most guys around my age. I don't flaunt my wealth and I have no problems dating a guy earning less. But maybe because of my finances, guys don't feel the need to treat me out? Or maybe my insistence on paying for the first few dates is setting a precedent? 

It was so bad that when a guy on a first date bought me a cup of coffee after lunch, I nearly melted because nobody has really done that for me before 😭 Would love to hear other people's experiences!

TLDR: I pay for the first 1-2 dates, and I find myself paying for the rest of the dating relationship. Would like to understand possible reasons why this is happening.",4,1753943129.0,dating_advice,15,0.7,False

Todays offerings vs what she ate:

Yoghurt pouch : finished half with heaps of encouragement 

One piece of Vegemite toast no crusts: needed lots of encouragement 

Offered banana and turkey sliced : ate a single slice of turkey no banana 

I ate an oat bar so she wanted one.
She just crumbed it up and maybe had two tiny bites.

I went through maccas for. A coffee and a hash brown I didn’t want to offer her much take away but I bought her a hash brown just to see if she will eat.
No more than a few bites.

Made her a ham and cheese sandwich she eats maybe a quarter of it.

Afternoon snack.
Offered her cheese crackers and turkey again.
No crackers just a few bites of a slice of turkey.

I made a banana and honey milkshake for her and she had a gulps of a small cup but again that’s it.


I feel like she is only taking bites out of her food she’s never really fully eating a meal.
And if she does ever finish it it’s with soooo much encouragement and I have to play games with it to make her eat.
This is even when she isn’t sick.
It’s improved maybe by 20% more of consumption 

She still needs to eat dinner tonight I think she will have 5 mouth fulls.

Is this how toddlers eat?
I see some toddlers eating like men.

After a string of relationships where I ignored red flags, I started keeping track of both positive and concerning things that happen when I’m dating someone new.

	•	“Respected when I said I needed to leave early ✓”
	•	“Got weirdly intense when I mentioned my ex”
	•	“Remembered my coffee order 🥺”
	•	“Made 3 ‘jokes’ about my friends being a bad influence”

1mdu2pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mdu2pn/his_rejected_royal_mate/,His Rejected Royal Mate,"His Rejected Royal Mate

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It took his grandfather’s centennial birthday for him to finally bring our son, Gale, and me home to the pack.

He swore the pack Elders had finally given us their blessing.

Our son, buzzing with excitement, bounced on the bed, clutching the champion’s medal from his junior fighting tournament.

He’d fought tooth and nail to win it, just to make his father proud.

But the moment we set foot on the Blackwood Manor grounds, we saw him.

Adrian, with his arms wrapped around a blonde she-wolf, kissing her deeply.

Adrian introduced her with a smile. ""My mate, Sophia""

Our son, Gale, rushed forward to confront him, stabbing a finger toward the seemingly perfect bite mark on my neck.

""That's the mark Dad gave Mom! You all see it!""

But the pack’s Head Elder stepped forward.

After a cursory glance, he let out a cold sneer.

""A clever trick of blood magic,"" he said with contempt. ""It can mimic a scent, but it lacks the soul-deep connection of a true mate bond. Any experienced wolf can see through it.""

I turned to Adrian, my body frozen stiff.

He turned away from me, gently stroking the real mark on Sophia's neck, which glowed with a silvery, moonlit light.

""The Blackwood pack will not accept a half-blood who can’t even shift"" he said. ""The only one fit to stand by my side is Sophia.""

I looked at him, and a bitter laugh escaped me.

To think I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood for a man like this.

Chapter 1

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It wasn't until I walked in on him kissing his first love that I learned the mating mark he gave me was a fake.

I touched the back of my neck in disbelief.

""Eight years! You lied to me for eight whole years?!""

Everyone’s eyes were on me, but I could only see Adrian's expressionless face.

The face I had kissed countless times, the one I thought I would spend my life with.

""What is this, then?"" I ripped my collar open, revealing the delicate, crescent-shaped bite mark. ""What the hell is this?""

""Don't cause a scene, Elena,"" Adrian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Causing a scene?

A disbelieving gasp escaped me, and I staggered back.

For eight years, I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood, turned down a career I dreamed of, and cut myself off from my friends, all because he kept insisting, ""The time isn't right.""

""I'm causing a scene?"" My voice trembled. ""You're the one who made a fool of me!""

I walked toward him, needing an explanation, needing him to say this was all a misunderstanding.

But Adrian pushed me away, his touch cold and dismissive.

Like he was shoving away a stranger, a nuisance.

""That's enough. It's time for you to go.""

That push was crueler than any words.

The whispers around us erupted into a storm of murmurs.

""Poor woman. Used as a replacement and didn't even know it.""

""Did she really think the Blackwood pack would want an outsider as their Luna?""

""Look at the kid. He's not a pureblood. Just a mutt.""

Every word was a knife, twisting in my heart.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""

""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""

She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.

""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""

""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""

One hundred thousand dollars.

He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.

""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""

She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""

My legs started to give out.

""No... that's impossible...""

""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""

He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.

""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.

Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.

""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.

Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.

""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.

The medal clattered to the ground.

That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.

Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.

She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.

A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.

""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""

She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""

""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""

Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.

I lunged forward to protect him.

But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

""Elena.""

Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.

Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.

She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.

""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""

With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""

""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.

He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""

His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.

I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.

For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.

After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""

And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""

""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.

""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""

""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""

Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.

The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.

""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.

""Elena, control your whelp.""

""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.

""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.

I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.

A searing pain shot through me.

""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""

He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.

He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.

""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.

But Gale's foot slipped.

Time seemed to stand still.

I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.

""NO—""

A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.

Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.

""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.

My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.

""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.

His little face was turning pale as paper.

""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.

Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.

""Stop the act, Elena.""

Act?

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.

""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""

Regenerative ability?

Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.

He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!

I didn't have time to explain.

I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.

""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""

""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""

I looked back at Adrian.

He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.

He was completely ignoring his dying son.

""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.

He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.

Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.

He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.

""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""

With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.

The small body in my arms was growing colder.

Chapter 3

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.

""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.

I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.

He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.

A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.

""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""

I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.

I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.

Nothing.

""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.

The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.

Someone had tampered with my car.

An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.

""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.

I needed to borrow a car.

I needed to beg someone for help.

But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.

Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.

""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""

""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.

Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""

Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.

""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""

I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.

He called it an act?

""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""

""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""

""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.

Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.

Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.

""Quick! Get in the car!""

The car sped through the night.

I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.

His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.

""Faster, please, go faster!""

""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""

But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.

""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""

""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.

I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.

I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.

The heavy doors swung shut.

The red light above the door lit up.

I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.

It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.

Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.

I took a deep breath and answered.

""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""

""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.

""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""

The good of the pack?

My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?

""Your son is dying!""

""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""

I heard a door open on his end.

Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.

""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.

""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.

""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""

Playing house.

There it was again.

""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""

""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.

""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""

Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.

I couldn't listen anymore.

Eight years.

My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.

Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.

I was just a substitute, a plaything.

And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.

The emergency room doors opened.

A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.

""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""

A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.

The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.

For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.

I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.

But now, he just lay there.

His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.

Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.

A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.

I held Gale and cried all night.

When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.

Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.

The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.

The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.

They dared…

On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

Chapter 4

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.

Right where Gale used to love to slide down.

Footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.

When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.

""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""

He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.

He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.

""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""

I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.

""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""

""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.

""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.

""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""

Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.

""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""

I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.

""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.

Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.

""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""

""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""

""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""

""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""

""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""

She had a point.

If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?

""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""

""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.

But Adrian grabbed my wrist.

""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""

""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""

""This is our home!""

""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""

Sophia smirked.

""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""

""I gave everything for this family!""

""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""

""I suppressed who I am for you!""

""That was your choice.""

I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.

The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.

""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.

""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""

""Slander?""

""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""

I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.

No one believed me.

Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.

On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.

""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""

""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""

I walked toward the door.

""Just you wait.""

Adrian's POV

The next afternoon.

The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.

The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.

The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.

""Adrian Blackwood, do you willingly accept Sophia as your mate…""

The ceremony was proceeding smoothly.

But Adrian couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Elena's behavior yesterday…

He had assumed she was just struggling to accept his relationship with Sophia and was acting out for his attention.

But today, she was nowhere to be seen.

He had planned to wait until this was over, until he had the full power of an Alpha, to go and explain everything to Elena.

The mark was fake, but his love for her, he told himself, had never been.

A wave of panic suddenly washed over him.

""Where is Tyler?"" He suddenly remembered telling Tyler to go help Elena last night, but he'd never heard back.

The mind link wasn't connecting.

He sent Tyler a text.

Go check on Elena and Gale. See what they're doing.

The ceremony continued.

""And now, the couple will exchange vows…""

Just then, Tyler burst into the ceremonial grounds.

He was pale, his forehead beaded with sweat.

""Alpha!"" he cried, rushing to Adrian, his voice trembling. ""Something's happened!""

Everyone stopped and stared.

""Gale… Gale is really dead!"" Tyler's voice was practically a shout. ""I just confirmed it with the hospital!""",1,1753942839.0,Contemporary_Romance,3,1.0,False

I've drafted this post so many times but I end up writing a whole novel of background info. So here is my dilemma: My mom is broke. She works in sales and hasn't made a commission in years and I am terrified. The economy right now is in the dumpster, so i get it. I, myself, finished school in December and have been job hunting ever since and finally landed 2 part time jobs. Yay me! [Sidenote: I know the economy is bad but like daaaaaaamn] Now I can finally focus my time (when I'm not working) on building a portfolio in hopes of landing a full time job in my chosen career (software dev - current market for this field is also giving me anxiety but I love it so I'm pushing through. Also this is my second career ( I'm 30+ yrs old)). I don't make anywhere near the amount needed to help with the mortgage or her credit card debt (I personally don't do credit cards or any form of debt, if I cant pay cash then I can't afford it). I can cover my expenses and utility. My goal is to move out of her home as soon as I can for my own wellbeing (unrelated to the current issue at hand). She is always yelling at me about this in a way that sounds like I am the cause of this. I am usually supportive of her ideas to branch out into other industries and am honest when I dont think the idea is good (like starting a coffee shop - she knows nothing about coffee, the coffee scene is very competitive where we live and most shops do not make it, and it's too expensive to start). I think she would do well as a sales coach or life coach for single mothers ( her idea) but she refuses to learn the basics of social media (how to make a video, how to upload a video) and is constantly outsourcing to people who aren't good (think PowerPoint slide as a reel) or just straight up scam her. She signs up for things that she doesnt know how to use (VERY tech illiterate) that cost a lot of money. She is great at sales, she rocks at it but the women is impulsive, 0 patience, does not want to learn and does not think critically. Inevitably, she yells at me to fix her problems and when I try to teach her how to solve her own problems I get yelled at more and get insulted. I know her problems are hers, they aren't mine to bear but old habits die hard. I've tried asking and communicating to her to not unload her problems into my lap, I've tried guiding her to look up resources like guiding her through borrowing an ebook from the library or free online marketing courses through the library but she just doesnt bother learning and is always asking then yelling if I dont do it for her. I'm at my wits end. I've suggested finding a different kind of sales job (sales but different product) and her response is ""so i can make $10/hr, ha"" to which I inform her that ""no, other types of sales jobs can be very lucrative because they're commission based"" and she responded with ""so find me one. I dont know how to do it"" and I told her indeed.com and well that didnt go over too well with her. Now I do have a lot of empathy for my mom. She moved to a foreign country on her own (single mom) and she worked her butt off my entire life. She's tired, she wants to retire and live a soft life. I would love to be rich enough to let her retire but alas that is not my current reality. 

I dont want to postpone my future and have to learn marketing, video editing, etc to get her going in coaching and sales. I just want to go to my 2 part time jobs that I'm super excited by, work on my coding projects that really excite me and apply to dev jobs (get a full time job in my field) then save enough money and leave. Also, no one experiences this side of her but me. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.
