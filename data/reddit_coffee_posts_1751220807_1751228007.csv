Do you feel like you‚Äôre made of contradictions? Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn‚Äôt meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 25, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life‚Äôs not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won‚Äôt just get me, but who‚Äôs also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren‚Äôt a priority for you, we‚Äôre not meant for each other.

But this post isn‚Äôt just about politics. It‚Äôs about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go ‚Äúso I was just thinking...‚Äù

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there‚Äôs beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn‚Äôt found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night ‚Äúwhat even is happiness?‚Äù kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who‚Äôll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other‚Äôs chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one‚Äôs watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi. No filters needed.",1,1751227625.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1lno6cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1lno6cr/failed_2_12_days_into_my_fast_how_can_i_do_better/,Failed 2 1/2 days into my fast. How can I do better?,"M, 6' 0"", 235 ibs

I started off doing a few days of very low calorie and carnivore at the same time. Day 1 had some bone broth (so I guess a bit of a dirty fast), by the end of the day I was feeling kind of tired and had some muscle pain in my legs from doing a walk the day prior (at was a fast paced walk but I shouldn't be feeling my muscles be this sore). Day 2 I had some electrolytes but was struggling with it because clearly what I was using was acting as a bit of a laxative or something. By the beginning of the 3rd day I was walking from the hotel to the office at 2am (I do short trips for work) and I just felt sluggish, tired, unmotivated. I still had the energy to do the walk but I could just tell that this level of fatigue and general ""not okayness"" wasn't good so I chose to end my fast.

I'm disappointed because I did want to go longer and I wasn't even struggling with hunger or urges to eat... I just knew I had to call it. 

Things I think I'm struggling with:

* magnesium: I couldn't find no-salt (or similar) before the fast so I just bought some magnesium tablets and I'm pretty sure my body wants to shit that out immediately. I'll find some no-salt before my next attempt for sure.

* artificial sweeteners: I took the advice of sweetening my electrolyte cocktail with mio. In the past if I have too much artificial sweetener it will kind of go through me. I think this may have been a bit of a mistake on my part. Do any of you do unsweetened electrolytes and how do you handle that best?

* coffee: I switched back to black coffee from tea a while ago due to tea having less gut impact. This on top of everything else may have made everything worse.

* I may have tried drinking too many electrolytes over too short of a time period.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be great.",1,1751227587.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

I had an Innisia for about 8 years with milk frother and it gave out ao have a cheapo espresso pod machine until I decided.

I was almost going to get the Delonghi Evo superautomatic but now leaning back to Nespresso.

Can anyone share their experience pro or con? How long you have it etc? I am going to hold hope that their might be a prime day deal(most likely not) but hope to get something soon.

I know I could probably get a citzi but the steamer is calling my name.

1lno3xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1lno3xu/29m_anyone_want_to_chat_for_a_while_and_talk/,29M Anyone want to chat for a while and talk about anything?,"I'm looking to make some new friends on here. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for any type of chats about anything or everything. Hppefully will be more long term but also down for short term chats too. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. Also want to start making different types of bread/sourdough so if know anything about that I would like to learn. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck to play on the go or in loving room tv.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",0,1751227414.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.5,False

Throwing my hat into the ring here! I'm a 28-year-old guy from Pennsylvania, looking to meet a great woman for a genuine connection. I'm not really into games or fleeting encounters; I'm hoping to find someone I can truly click with, laugh with, and build something meaningful.
A little about me:

 *Professionally: I'm a billing analyst for a utility company near me. I find my work fulfilling and enjoy the challenges it brings!


 *Hobbies & Interests: When I'm not working, you can usually find me hiking local trails, playing some vidya games, reading manga, and watching pretty much any anime or horror movie I can get my hands on. I'm always open to trying new things and sharing experiences.


*Personality: Friends would describe me as sarcastic but kind, reliable, and a good listener. I value open communication, a good sense of humor, and someone who's comfortable being themselves.


 * What I'm looking for: 

I'm hoping to find a woman who is ambitious, kind-hearted, has a great sense of humor, enjoys intellectual conversations, and loves animals! 

Someone who's excited about life and isn't afraid to be authentic. Whether it's exploring a new town, trying a new restaurant, or just chilling on the couch with a good movie, I'm looking for someone to share those moments with.
If any of this resonates with you, send me a message! Tell me a little about yourself and what you're looking for. Bonus points if you have a favorite local spot for coffee, pizza or hiking! (:

Looking forward to hearing from you!

1lnnli4,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1lnnli4/am_i_wrong_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_cant_be/,Am I wrong for telling my girlfriend she can‚Äôt be my caddie girl because that‚Äôs always been my twin sister‚Äôs thing?,"Accidentally deleted my post, posting again.

I (23M) have been dating my girlfriend for three years. I also have a twin sister who I‚Äôm incredibly close with, she‚Äôs been my close friend for as long as I can remember. One of our longest-standing traditions started when we were 15: she became my caddie whenever I played golf. It wasn‚Äôt about the sport at first, it was just a way for us to carve out time together, just the two of us. When we started, we‚Äôd walk the course side by side, talking about life, venting about school, or just staying quiet and enjoying the sun. She always carried a small cooler bag with drinks and snacks she knew I liked, and she‚Äôd write fake ‚Äúmotivational quotes‚Äù on my scorecard in ridiculous cursive to make me laugh when I was playing badly.

When we turned 16, our dad gave us his old golf cart as a gift, and that added a whole new layer to the tradition. Now she drives the cart every single time, she calls herself my ‚Äúchauffeur‚Äù and always shows up with a new playlist just for our round. Some days she pretends she‚Äôs on the LGPA and dresses up in golf skirts and visors ironically, and other days she‚Äôs in sweats with an iced coffee, just vibing and giving me advice I never asked for. It‚Äôs silly, it‚Äôs grounding, and it‚Äôs ours. We still do it about once a month, and honestly, it‚Äôs one of the few things in my life that‚Äôs remained steady through all the changes that come with growing up.

A couple weeks ago, my girlfriend asked if she could come out and be my caddie sometime. She said it looked fun and wanted to be part of something that clearly means a lot to me. I told her sure and I‚Äôd talk to my sister about it. But when I mentioned it to my sister, she got really sad, and I felt bad. The next day, she was honest with me, she said she felt like she was losing something that was just hers. That being my caddie wasn‚Äôt just a role, it was a connection. And that she looked forward to those afternoons more than I probably realized.

And the thing is‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs right. This isn‚Äôt just about golf. It‚Äôs about how well she knows me out there. She picks up on things without me saying a word, she knows when I‚Äôm getting frustrated and starts humming softly to calm me down. She hands me the right club before I even ask. She remembers which holes throw me off and cracks a joke to break the tension. She even knows I won‚Äôt use the same tee twice and always brings extras without me needing to mention it. There‚Äôs a rhythm to it, and a comfort I don‚Äôt think I could recreate with anyone else.

This tradition helped us stay close through hard years, through heartbreaks, moves, stress, and everything in between. It‚Äôs always been a space where I can breathe, where we don‚Äôt have to explain ourselves to each other. And she‚Äôs not replaceable in that. I didn‚Äôt want her to feel pushed out of something that‚Äôs been so special to both of us.

So I told my girlfriend that maybe we could start a different tradition of our own, maybe mini-golf, lessons, or even just hitting the range together. Something that‚Äôs just ours from the beginning.

But she took it really hard. She said I was choosing my sister over her, that she just wanted to feel included, and that I didn‚Äôt even give her a chance. She‚Äôs been sort of sort of sad about it ever since, and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it.

I understand where she‚Äôs coming from, no one wants to feel like they‚Äôre on the outside of something meaningful to their partner. But this is something I‚Äôve held onto since I was a kid. Something quiet and sacred and real. I don‚Äôt want to give it up.

They think it was just about good service. Corporate spin to sell lukewarm gas station coffee as gourmet. And for most stores‚Ä¶ that was true.

But some stores‚Äîlike this one‚Äîweren‚Äôt offering coffee to customers.

They were offering it to something else.

I brought a new candy for Lila again tonight. Orange blossom honey chews I found at a Persian grocery. She smiled when she saw the bright foil wrappers. Took one, then vanished into the candy aisle with a humming noise I hadn‚Äôt heard before. Almost like singing.

Miss was already here too, lounging on the lottery counter like a panther bored with its prey. Her coat tonight shimmered like icicles and night fog. She was watching the coffee machine.

She never watches the coffee machine.

10:02 PM ‚Äì Shift Begins

The system clicked over to third shift. I walked the store once, locked the back door, checked the Slurpee machine‚Äîno red or black tonight.

But the coffee machine blinked at me. An orange light on the bean hopper pulsed once‚Ä¶ then again.

Low on beans.

Easy enough. I opened the cabinet under the counter. Nothing. I checked the backup shelf. Still nothing.

I stared at the blinking light for too long.

""Did we get any delivery today?"" I asked.

Miss didn‚Äôt answer.

""I know we had backup stock,"" I muttered, already checking under the register.

Still nothing.

A scraping sound echoed from the coffee machine.

Not dripping. Not brewing. Just‚Ä¶ grinding. Slowly.

‚ÄúLila?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúYou see where they moved the beans?‚Äù

She popped her head up over the counter.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

""Then‚Äî""

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt let it run out.‚Äù

Miss moved suddenly, landing on her bare feet like she hadn‚Äôt just been sitting down. Her expression wasn‚Äôt teasing tonight. It was cold.

‚ÄúThat machine‚Äôs older than it looks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt remembers being something else.‚Äù

10:34 PM ‚Äì The Beans Run Out

I tried topping it with a decaf blend from the tea shelf. No luck. The machine locked itself down and beeped once‚Äîlong and low.

Then it went quiet.

I stepped back. Just as the lights flickered.

The store went silent.

The fans. The cooler. The buzz of fluorescent light.

Everything stopped.

Then‚Ä¶

A drip.

I turned back to the coffee machine.

It was brewing. From nothing.

There were no beans, no water in the reservoir. But the pot filled anyway. Thick, black liquid. So black it looked matte‚Äîlike it absorbed the light around it.

I backed up. Hit the black phone in the office.

Ring.

11:05 PM ‚Äì The Man in the Gray Hoodie

He walked in like he was just another trucker. But his feet didn‚Äôt make noise on the floor. Not even a creak.

He walked right to the coffee machine. Poured himself a full cup from the pitch-black brew.

Didn‚Äôt ask. Didn‚Äôt pay.

He sipped it. Smiled. Then he looked right at me.

‚ÄúYou left her in the attic,‚Äù he said.

I froze.

‚ÄúYou were twelve. You thought it was a raccoon. But it wasn‚Äôt. It kept asking for you.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember what it sounded like when it stopped?‚Äù

They told me not to move. Told me to lock the front door. Told me to cover all mirrors.

I did it.

2:33 AM ‚Äì After the Silence

The machine started working again. Back to its old self. Beeping. Asking for fresh brew.

Lila stayed near me the rest of the night. Quiet. Resting her head on the counter when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking.

Miss watched the glass in the front door all night. She never blinked.

He had a chip made to bypass emissions vatts timing curve line pressures & basically used it as a Donut car he and his friends would do ghetto drifting events so he didn't care about the speedo, fuel, A/C or heat it was a couple hours with buddies couple times a month wearing out back tires.

I immediately put some exhaust on it and sent the cluster over to have it repaired I do care about how much fuel is in the tank, how fast & I'm going. When I got the cluster back it didn't work, or so I thought 30 minute drive to cluster shop plugs it in and yep everything works perfect.

I took dash pad out to fix the cracks and noticed nothing plugged into this. Is there supposed to be?

 This car was had sat & was on its way to part out when he got it. Didn't run you know the drill. Before he had the chip made he had swapped nearly all the relays out when he got the chip it started and ran well. Like holy smokes cant believe this is stock well. But he didn't care nothing else worked even the air bag is unplugged. 
Anyway I have pretty much retired and decided to go through the dash

I have another 93 parts car, but is doesnt have this (dash pad was near perfect) plug showing anywhere

In a world filled with noise, your love remains *my guiding star in the darkest nights*. But how do we grasp this magic? How do we make it blossom in the garden of our days? Here are paths from pen to heart, to nurture love‚Äôs seeds until our dreams bear fruit.¬† 

### 1. Whispers of the Heart¬† 
Let us dive into a sea of unspoken words, where distances dissolve between our breaths. Tell me your soul‚Äôs secrets, and let me recite my heart‚Äôs tale. Every word we scatter is a *silken bridge* connecting our worlds.¬† 

### 2. Hidden Messages of Longing¬† 
Flowers alone don‚Äôt speak the language of lovers! A meal prepared by a yearning heart, a note hidden in your pocket like a *stolen kiss*. These small gestures are maps leading us to love‚Äôs treasures.¬† 

### 3. Dance of Souls¬† 
Affection isn‚Äôt just a touch of hands‚Äîit‚Äôs hearing my heartbeat *before* my words. Ask me about the clouds in my day, and let me tell you of my evening passions. These melodies compose our eternal symphony.¬† 

### 4. Weaving Eternity from Moments¬† 
Let us stitch a gown from our memories, embroidered with stars! An unknown road to discover, or a cup of coffee in the rain. These moments are *wings* carrying us beyond reality.¬† 

### 5. Anthems of the Vulnerable Heart¬† 
Don‚Äôt let ""I love you"" dwell in silence! Say it like morning dew, write it on my forehead with tears of joy. These simple words are the *magic* that revives my heart at dawn.¬† 

### 6. Harbor of Souls¬† 
When life‚Äôs storms rage, let us be each other‚Äôs sanctuary. Carry me when I cannot fly, and I‚Äôll be your shade in the scorching noon. In this warmth, we discover love is an *unconquerable fortress*.¬† 

### 7. Sacredness in Differences¬† 
Let us build a temple for our unique mysteries, dancing to two rhythms in miraculous harmony. Honoring each other‚Äôs shadows is the *soil* where our love blooms.¬† 

### Epilogue: The Never-Ending Journey¬† 
Love isn‚Äôt a destination‚Äîit‚Äôs the *ocean we sail with every heartbeat*. Every whisper, every glance, every shared laugh is a wave carrying our boat to unseen shores. Remember: the greatest love stories aren‚Äôt written in words, but in the *language of united hearts*.¬† 
Come‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs write our next chapter.¬†",2,1751225644.0,unsentLoveLetters1st,0,1.0,False

This kind of thing has been happening more and more. Family dinners are a nightmare, with me constantly saying ""pardon?"" or just nodding along like I understood. Even the TV volume keeps going up, and my partner's definitely noticed. I'm in my late 50s, and I honestly thought this was something that happened much later in life.

1lnn83k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheapButGood/comments/1lnn83k/how_i_cut_my_grocery_bill_in_half_without/,How I Cut My Grocery Bill in Half Without Clipping Coupons,"Let‚Äôs be honest, grocery shopping in 2025 feels like you‚Äôre bleeding cash just for basic stuff. Meat? Expensive. Cereal? Basically a luxury item. And somehow, even a head of lettuce now costs more than your morning coffee used to. I hit a breaking point after realizing my grocery spending was swallowing nearly 10% of my income.

So I decided to change things but without becoming one of those Extreme Couponing people who have binders and a warehouse in their basement.

Here‚Äôs what actually worked for me (and might work for you too):

**1. Shop the sales.**  
Forget coupons for now. The biggest savings come from buying items only when they hit their lowest price. I started tracking prices with a basic notes app and checking weekly flyers using Flipp. Aldi and Lidl often beat Walmart.

**2. Build a small stockpile.**  
When pasta or cereal goes on sale, I buy enough to last 6‚Äì8 weeks. No hoarding, just buying smart. This means I rarely pay full price for anything now.

**3. Eat less meat.**  
Meatless meals a couple nights a week saved me hundreds. Lentil soup, veggie stir-fry nothing fancy, just filling and cheap.

**4. Plan around what you already have.**  
Instead of building a shopping list from recipes, I build meals around what‚Äôs in the pantry and on sale. It‚Äôs backward meal planning, and it works.

**5. Match coupons to sales (if you want to level up).**  
A $1 coupon on a $2 item? Yes. A $1 coupon on a $5 item? Meh. Use coupons only *after* you‚Äôve found the lowest sale price. Combine with cashback apps like Ibotta or Fetch if you want to stack it.

**Other stuff that helped:**

* Loyalty programs (free and sometimes shockingly helpful)
* Shopping seasonally (hello cheap squash in fall)
* Using leftovers creatively
* Reducing waste (buying less, throwing out less)

I‚Äôm not saying this is magic. It took a few weeks to get the hang of it. But now I save $50‚Äì$75/week without obsessing over deals or spending hours prepping. It‚Äôs doable even if you‚Äôre busy or bad at math.",1,1751225198.0,CheapButGood,0,1.0,False

1lnn73s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychHorror/comments/1lnn73s/the_cost_of_desire/,The Cost of Desire,"In the dim glow of her laptop, Maya scrolled through the dating app, her thumb hovering over profiles that promised wealth and security. At 36, she was done with chasing sparks. Love had left her bruised, so now she sought stability‚Äîa transactional arrangement, cold but certain. The app, Gilded Match, catered to those like her, pairing ambition with affluence. Her profile was clear: Seeking a partner who provides. No games, no drama. She swiped right on Victor, a 50-year-old tech mogul whose bio read like a contract: Generous. Discreet. Expect loyalty.

Their first date was at a rooftop restaurant in Seattle, the city‚Äôs skyline glittering like a promise. Victor was polished, his suit crisp, his smile calculated. Over small plates of overpriced tapas, he laid out the terms: a penthouse, a monthly allowance, and trips abroad, in exchange for her companionship‚Äîand silence. Maya‚Äôs heart didn‚Äôt race, but her mind did. This was safety, not love. She signed the NDA he slid across the table without hesitation.

The first month was flawless. Victor‚Äôs penthouse was a sterile palace of glass and steel, every surface reflecting her new life. He bought her dresses, paid her debts, and wired $10,000 to her account on the first of the month. But at night, when he thought she was asleep, he‚Äôd whisper to himself in the dark, words she couldn‚Äôt catch, like a prayer or a curse. She ignored it. The money was real; the rest was noise.

Then the dreams started. In them, Maya stood in a mirrored room, her reflection twisting into someone else‚Äîpale, eyeless, smiling with too many teeth. The figure whispered her name, its voice echoing Victor‚Äôs cadence, promising more if she gave more. She woke sweating, the penthouse silent except for Victor‚Äôs murmurs from the next room. She told herself it was stress, the price of a life she hadn‚Äôt earned.

One night, Victor handed her a black velvet box. Inside was a necklace, its pendant a heavy, obsidian stone that seemed to pulse under her touch. ‚ÄúWear it always,‚Äù he said, his eyes unblinking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of the deal.‚Äù She complied, the stone cold against her skin. That night, the dreams sharpened. The eyeless figure was closer, its hands clawing at her reflection, whispering, You wanted this. Pay the cost. Maya‚Äôs days blurred; she‚Äôd find herself standing in rooms she didn‚Äôt remember entering, the necklace tight around her throat.

She tried to leave. Packed a bag, booked a flight. But at the airport, her card was declined, her phone locked, her identity somehow erased. Victor was waiting at the penthouse when she returned, his smile unchanged. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt break a contract,‚Äù he said, his voice layering with the one from her dreams. The stone burned against her chest, and she swore her reflection in the glass walls moved without her.

Desperate, Maya confronted him. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to me?‚Äù she screamed. Victor‚Äôs eyes darkened, and for a moment, his face flickered‚Äîpale, eyeless, grinning. ‚ÄúYou wanted security,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI gave it to you. But everything has a price.‚Äù The room spun, the mirrors reflecting not her, but the figure from her dreams, now wearing her face.

She clawed at the necklace, but it wouldn‚Äôt break. The penthouse walls seemed to close in, the city‚Äôs lights dimming outside. Victor‚Äôs voice was everywhere, inside her skull, her veins. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine now,‚Äù it said, and she felt her thoughts unravel, her will slipping like sand. The last thing she saw was her reflection, smiling with too many teeth, as the stone pulsed in rhythm with her fading heartbeat.

In the morning, Victor sipped coffee, scrolling through Gilded Match. A new profile caught his eye: Seeking stability. No games. He smiled, the obsidian pendant glinting in his pocket, waiting for its next wearer.",1,1751225126.0,PsychHorror,0,1.0,False

In October I'll be going on my second cruise after one on the Oasis of the Seas a number of years ago now (pre-refurb), this time on the MSC World Europa. I'm going with family who are experienced cruises but have never been on this ship. For my first cruise it was obviously a huge ship with just massive amounts of people and things to do, but it was before the refurb so not quite as many things to do on that particular ship. However there were a few things I really appreciated at the time and a lot I don't remember because I was pretty young.

- Are there any easy ways to get soft drinks/soda around the ship? I remember lots of machines with all sorts of drinks in (this was years ago, no specifics) and I've read they have machines on this ship but equally that they've been turned off for months. Any updates on this?

- WiFi - does anyone know how much per day? And what is signal like the rest of the time, particularly in port?

- What drinks are free without any packages (this is the Fantastica level/class of rooms if it makes a difference)? I've seen that tea and coffee are free but also that a number of places you have to pay, and conflicting things about sort drinks, e.g. having to pay in the buffet?

- Any other tips? Emphasis on the fact that I remember very little from my first cruise so I would really, really appreciate any tips whatsoever! I've done some research but it's very daunting to know where to start, particular when looking for such a new ship that there's a bit more limited information on.

Thank you so much to anyone who has experience and is able to help!",1,1751224985.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

""I Thought I Was Faithful‚Ä¶ Until One Conversation Changed Everything. Here‚Äôs the truth, the part I rarely admit, even to myself in the darkest hours before dawn. It started small, a tiny crack in the carefully constructed dam of my life, and it grew into something vast and terrifying, almost drowning me in its complexities. This is my confession, laid bare not just for you, but finally, for me.  My name is Clara. I‚Äôm 34, navigating the sprawling, sometimes anonymous landscape of a city suburb. For seven years, I‚Äôve been married to Mark. Seven years of shared meals, quiet evenings on the sofa, predictable routines, and the comforting hum of a life built together, brick by careful brick. We weren't unhappy, at least not in any dramatic, fight-every-night way. Our life was‚Ä¶ good. Stable. Comfortable. But somewhere along the way, the vibrant colours seemed to fade to pastels. The deep, searching conversations we had in our early days were replaced by logistics who was picking up groceries, bills to pay, plans for the weekend that rarely ventured beyond the familiar. I felt seen, yes, but maybe not understood, not in the way I yearned for. There was a quiet ache, a loneliness that settled deep in my bones, a feeling like I was performing the role of ‚Äòwife‚Äô rather than truly being myself within the marriage.  Then David joined the consulting team at work. He was in his late 30s, with eyes that seemed to genuinely light up when he talked about his passions obscure indie films, philosophy books I‚Äôd only pretentiously added to my ‚Äòto read‚Äô list, the complexities of human behaviour. Our desks were near each other, and initially, it was just water cooler chat, the usual office banter. But he had a way of looking at you when you spoke, like your words were the most fascinating things he‚Äôd heard all day. He listened, truly listened, asking follow-up questions that showed he‚Äôd absorbed not just the facts, but the feelings behind them.  It began innocently. Shared lunches where our conversation drifted beyond work projects to life goals, frustrations, dreams we‚Äôd both quietly tucked away. Late nights at the office, fuelled by cold pizza and shared exhaustion, turned into vulnerable discussions about the pressures of our jobs, the compromises we felt we‚Äôd made. There was a spark, an intellectual and emotional connection that felt like finding a hidden room in a house I thought I knew intimately. It was intoxicating.  The temptation wasn‚Äôt a sudden, dramatic pull towards physical desire. It was far more insidious, a slow, gentle drift into an emotional current that felt irresistible. It was the anticipation of his ‚ÄòGood morning‚Äô message, the little inside jokes exchanged via Slack that made me smile genuinely for the first time that day. It was the way he remembered tiny details I‚Äôd mentioned in passing my favourite kind of tea, the name of my childhood dog, a minor fear I had. Mark remembered the big things, of course, our anniversary, my birthday. But David remembered the texture of my inner world.  With David, I felt a version of myself resurface that I hadn't realised I'd buried the curious, slightly quirky woman who hadn't yet categorised her life into neat boxes. I shared fears about not being good enough at my job, anxieties about the future, opinions on everything from politics to the best way to brew coffee, all the things I either felt Mark wouldn‚Äôt be interested in, or that felt too vulnerable to articulate in the comfortable silence that often fell between us. David met these revelations with understanding, validation, and a curious enthusiasm that made me feel incredibly‚Ä¶ alive.  The guilt started as a low thrumming beneath my ribs, like a faulty engine. It flared whenever Mark did something kind brought me coffee in the morning, or just reached for my hand while we watched TV. Each gesture of his genuine affection felt like a physical blow, a reminder of my quiet betrayal. I‚Äôd rationalise, telling myself, It‚Äôs just talking. It‚Äôs just friendship. I haven‚Äôt done anything physically. But I knew, deep down, that the line had blurred, then dissolved entirely. The emotional intimacy I was sharing with David felt far more significant, far more dangerous to my marriage, than a fleeting physical encounter ever could have. It was my heart, my mind, my deepest self I was offering on a silver platter to someone who wasn't my husband.  The dialogue with David was effortless, flowing, exciting. One rainy Tuesday evening, working late, we ended up in the deserted office kitchen, making tea. The clatter of spoons against mugs seemed amplified in the quiet. ‚ÄúRough day?‚Äù he asked, his voice low, leaning back against the counter. I sighed, rubbing my temples. ‚ÄúYou have no idea. Just‚Ä¶ feeling the weight of everything today. Work, home, just‚Ä¶ life.‚Äù He nodded slowly, his eyes meeting mine with that familiar, intense focus. ‚ÄúTell me about it. What‚Äôs the heaviest part?‚Äù And I did. I told him about the feeling of being stuck, about the dreams that felt increasingly out of reach, about the quiet desperation of wanting more connection without knowing how to ask for it, especially from the person I was supposed to be closest to. I spoke about the silence at home, not an uncomfortable silence, but one that felt empty of shared vulnerability. David listened without judgment, his occasional questions gentle, guiding me deeper into my own feelings. ‚ÄúIt sounds like you‚Äôre carrying a lot alone, Clara,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù In that moment, surrounded by the sterile office kitchen, I felt seen and understood in a way that took my breath away. It was a powerful, dangerous feeling. Later that night, I checked my phone before Mark woke up. There was a message from David: Just thinking about our conversation. Hope today feels lighter. A simple message, but it felt like a secret hand reaching out in the dark, acknowledging the hidden part of my life.  Dialogue with Mark, on the other hand, felt strained, or perhaps, simply lacking. ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù he‚Äôd ask across the dinner table, scrolling on his phone. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, picking at my food. ‚ÄúSame old.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, mine too. Did you remember to call about the internet bill?‚Äù The contrast was stark, and it only deepened the chasm I felt growing between us. I started resenting Mark for not being David, for not asking the right questions, for not seeing the ‚Äòreal‚Äô me the me that David seemed to effortlessly uncover. This resentment, of course, was entirely unfair. I wasn‚Äôt giving Mark the chance to see that part of me; I was actively withholding it, nurturing it in the secret garden I was cultivating with David.  The tension became my constant companion. Every message notification from David sent a jolt of adrenaline mixed with fear through me. I became secretive with my phone, taking it with me everywhere, deleting message threads, clearing my search history. The thrill of our connection was potent, a potent brew of validation and forbidden excitement. But the consequences were real, tangible. I was emotionally unavailable at home. My patience with Mark wore thin. I was constantly distracted, living partly in reality and partly in the fantasy world I‚Äôd built with David. Sleep became difficult, my nights filled with replaying conversations, dissecting intentions, and wrestling with the heavy cloak of guilt.  One evening, David and I stayed late again. The office was empty, the city lights twinkling outside the window. We were talking about fears the kind that keep you up at night. The air felt thick, charged. He reached across the table, covering my hand with his. His touch wasn't overtly sexual, but it was firm, comforting, and incredibly intimate. It sent a wave of heat through me, a wave that crashed against the wall of my marriage, leaving a residue of shame. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre incredible, Clara,‚Äù he said softly, his thumb gently stroking the back of my hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever doubt that.‚Äù In that moment, I knew I had crossed a line I couldn't uncross. The emotional affair had reached its peak, culminating not in a kiss or a touch, but in that shared vulnerability and that knowing, validating touch that acknowledged the depth of our bond, a bond that had superseded the one I shared with my husband. The guilt that followed was crushing. It wasn't just a thrumming anymore; it was a pounding drum, echoing the sound of something vital breaking inside me.  That night, I went home to Mark, kissed him goodnight, and lay awake, staring at the ceiling. The face I saw wasn't his, but David‚Äôs, his words echoing in my mind. It was a stark, terrifying realization. I was emotionally involved with another man, not because Mark was cruel or neglectful, but because I had allowed myself to seek validation, excitement, and a sense of being ‚Äòseen‚Äô outside of my marriage, without first trying to address those needs within it. I had prioritized a thrilling escape over nurturing what I already had.  The emotional affair with David didn't end with a dramatic confrontation. It slowly, painfully, dissolved under the undeniable weight of my guilt and the looming fear of the damage I was doing. I started pulling back, responding less frequently, making excuses not to stay late. David noticed, of course, his messages shifting from their usual warmth to a questioning concern. Ending it, or rather, letting it fade, was like mourning a loss, a painful severing of a connection that had become a lifeline, however unhealthy. The silence he left behind was deafening, filled only by the echoes of my own actions and the quiet presence of the husband I had neglected.  Looking back now, the dust settled but the scars still visible, I see it with a painful clarity. Emotional cheating is a slow poison. It might not have the immediate, explosive fallout of physical infidelity, but it corrodes the foundation of trust, intimacy, and honesty just as effectively. It forced me to confront uncomfortable truths about myself, about my marriage, and about my capacity for self-deception.  What did I learn? I learned that the grass isn‚Äôt necessarily greener; sometimes, it just looks that way from a distance, shimmering with the dew of novelty and unreality. I learned that emotional needs are valid, but seeking to fulfill them entirely outside of your committed relationship is a profound betrayal not just of your partner, but of the vows you made and the life you built. I learned that the thrill of temptation is fleeting, but the weight of guilt lingers, seeping into every corner of your life.  It forced a painful, necessary reckoning with Mark. Not a full confession of the extent of the emotional affair some truths are too corrosive, and mine felt like one I needed to carry alone, at least for a time, as penance but a conversation about the distance that had grown between us, the lack of connection I felt, and importantly, my own part in allowing it to happen. We started talking, really talking, again. It‚Äôs slow, sometimes awkward, but it‚Äôs honest. We‚Äôre relearning how to be vulnerable with each other, how to listen, how to connect on that deeper level I craved.  My view on love, commitment, and personal integrity has been irrevocably changed. Love isn't just a feeling; it's a continuous act of choosing, of showing up, of tending to the garden you‚Äôve planted, even when it feels overgrown or the soil seems barren. Commitment isn't just loyalty; it‚Äôs active engagement, a willingness to work through discomfort and seek intimacy within the established bond. And personal integrity? It‚Äôs about aligning your actions with your values, even when it's difficult, even when temptation whispers sweet nothings designed to make you feel seen at the cost of being true.  I still carry the guilt, a dull ache that reminds me of how easily I drifted, how close I came to losing everything for the fleeting validation of an emotional connection outside my marriage. It‚Äôs a heavy burden, but perhaps a necessary one. It serves as a constant reminder of the woman I was, the choices I made, and the integrity I am committed to rebuilding, brick by careful brick, within the walls of the life I almost dismantled. This confession isn't seeking absolution; it's simply an acknowledgment of a truth I can no longer hide from. I emotionally cheated, and the person it damaged most profoundly, was me.""",2,1751224973.0,story,0,1.0,False
1lnn3s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1lnn3s4/how_do_you_react_do_you_contain_or_comfort/,How do you react? Do you contain or comfort people's cries?,"I'm opening this thread in relation to another topic in which I talked a bit about empathy. I'm a person who is especially insensitive to other people's cries, and often I simply don't know what to do when another person cries.

This week in particular, I've seen a few people crying, and by chance I was the only one there to ""contain"" them, but I'm actually very clumsy and awkward when I try to do so. It's as if I lack that kind of instinctive response to crying that other people have, which allows them to better comfort the person who's crying.

First, a university classmate talked about a painful topic in class and went crying to the bathroom. The professor didn't have the best idea and sent me to check on him. I think she sent the worst possible candidate. When I found my classmate in the bathroom, I simply thought it best to give him a hug and that was it (which was pretty robotic on my part). I knew he felt bad, but I couldn't bring myself to feel anything for him. I just did the politically correct thing, I guess. After that, he asked me to go with him to get some coffee, and he ended up buying me some food. I guess it was best if I treated him? I don't know.

Second, the other day one of my students came to class crying. She was arriving very late, with about 10 minutes left. I clearly saw her crying, but I didn't want to ask her anything; I just gave her the lesson and that was it. I didn't do anything here.

Third, yesterday I saw a coworker crying a lot. I was alone in the building having lunch, and she came in crying like Mary Magdalene. I told her to sit down and asked if she needed help with anything. I tried to act concerned, but my performance was terrible because I really didn't care. She was a coworker I cared about very little and didn't care much about. I really just tried to contain her so I could feel useful and emotionally superior to her, although, as I told you, my performance wasn't good anyway.

This worries me a little (yes, it really only worries me a little; it's not something I really care about that much), not having even a good performance, because in the future I will be a psychologist myself, and my greatest weakness is precisely being able to provide psychological first aid to people who are crying or who have gone through an immediate bad situation.

This is something my own university teachers have mentioned to me indirectly, and they must have already analyzed me thoroughly.

And how do you respond when you see someone crying or should you restrain someone who is emotional?",0,1751224893.0,NPD,1,0.5,False

""I Thought I Was Faithful‚Ä¶ Until One Conversation Changed Everything. Here‚Äôs the truth, the part I rarely admit, even to myself in the darkest hours before dawn. It started small, a tiny crack in the carefully constructed dam of my life, and it grew into something vast and terrifying, almost drowning me in its complexities. This is my confession, laid bare not just for you, but finally, for me.  My name is Clara. I‚Äôm 34, navigating the sprawling, sometimes anonymous landscape of a city suburb. For seven years, I‚Äôve been married to Mark. Seven years of shared meals, quiet evenings on the sofa, predictable routines, and the comforting hum of a life built together, brick by careful brick. We weren't unhappy, at least not in any dramatic, fight-every-night way. Our life was‚Ä¶ good. Stable. Comfortable. But somewhere along the way, the vibrant colours seemed to fade to pastels. The deep, searching conversations we had in our early days were replaced by logistics who was picking up groceries, bills to pay, plans for the weekend that rarely ventured beyond the familiar. I felt seen, yes, but maybe not understood, not in the way I yearned for. There was a quiet ache, a loneliness that settled deep in my bones, a feeling like I was performing the role of ‚Äòwife‚Äô rather than truly being myself within the marriage.  Then David joined the consulting team at work. He was in his late 30s, with eyes that seemed to genuinely light up when he talked about his passions obscure indie films, philosophy books I‚Äôd only pretentiously added to my ‚Äòto read‚Äô list, the complexities of human behaviour.

I could have gone home from pride with so many nice, good looking guys last night, but like a fool I came home to my own bed because I wanted to text him about it instead only to find him ignoring my texts and looking for people to get off with over hot women. Ha ha. Silly me. 

Anyways. At least I know now. No more fooling myself. I'll give myself tonight to feel sad, and then tomorrow, I'll actually message one of the nice guys who have asked me to meet them for coffee or a date. One night to beat myself up for caring. And then on we go.

1lnmvq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1lnmvq3/no_friends_no_hobbies/,No friends no hobbies,"Hi guys idk if anyone reads these long posts but I‚Äôm really looking for any guidance as I‚Äôve been feeling pretty down lately.

20M in summer after my second year college. 

High school was great for the most part. Had some issues but I had friends and was happy. First year college was one of best years I‚Äôve had. Was close to my dorm mates and had friends we‚Äôd hang out and do fun shit all the time.

Well couldnt pay school and had to drop out for my second year. Went home for summer came back to rent an apt in my college‚Äôs town and work full time to get back to school. I have no coworkers (or none that I‚Äôd be friends with the one or two I do have). Everyone from my first year went their separate ways and we don‚Äôt see each other. It was pretty miserable I had 0 friends, trying to reconnect with past ones was unsuccessful. I just worked full time and I have my gf who I love but she is genuinely my only social interaction. And if we werent together now wow I‚Äôd be in such a bad place being truly truly alone. 

I paid school and joined for the end of second year for spring, thinking I‚Äôd make more friends and see people my age on campus (I mostly serve older folks at my coffee shop I‚Äôm working). It did not happen. My only interactions are the superficial how‚Äôre you doing and what can I get for you at work.

I hung out with some first year friends recently and met their other friends. We were smoking but I had a pretty bad high stressing about the social interaction and the people and ended up leaving early which sucked bc it felt like my only shot in a while at having some social life and the last weeks I‚Äôve kept remembering how horrible a night I had and how I fucked up.

So now I‚Äôm figuring out what to do. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD but wondering if more is developing. Social anxiety, depression, inferiority syndrome, something else? I don‚Äôt necessarily always feel sad day to day but when I think about it I feel pretty bad. I feel like I don‚Äôt belong anywhere, I won‚Äôt fit in with anyone, no one is looking for anymore friends. I‚Äôm just in a cycle of work and school. I haven‚Äôt been doing too hot academically even. Idk if computer science is what I want to do or if I like it, I‚Äôm not good at it but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I used to do some more fun things like soccer, working out and playing instruments but haven‚Äôt been able to get back into it. Now I just play video games and hang out with my gf those are like my only 2 activities rn aside from work. I wish I had a solid group of friends to regularly hang out with. I can‚Äôt invite anyone to my apt I literally only have access to one small room (rent is expensive) and there‚Äôs not much to do around town. I‚Äôve been buying a lot of stuff recently after being in a good habit of saving and it‚Äôs kinda made me feel a little better but that‚Äôs obviously not healthy. I just feel so self conscious whenever I‚Äôm around people I feel like I will never make friends again. Idk what to do but living like this is slowly hurting me more and more and I‚Äôm just so tired of it and feel like there‚Äôs nothing to do.",1,1751224342.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1lnmugu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1lnmugu/one_year_in/,One Year In,"I took my first dose of Zep on June 14, 2024. I was at about 245 pounds, fitting comfortably in 44-inch waist pants. Today, I‚Äôm at 195, wearing 34-inch slacks. For those keeping score at home, that‚Äôs 50 pounds, more or less, and five pants sizes. Been quite a ride.

I‚Äôve been fortunate. The only significant side effect has been constipation, which I‚Äôve learned to manage with coffee, dried fruit (both of which I happen to enjoy, anyway), and patience. As my doc notes, I‚Äôm eating less and it moves through my system slower, so there‚Äôs less to <ahem> process. I‚Äôve taken to keeping track of poop frequency, to make sure I don‚Äôt get dangerously backed up.

The first 40 pounds came off fairly quickly over the first six months; since then, progress has been much slower. That‚Äôs about what the charts have shown would happen, but I do wish that the last 20 or so pounds would get the hell out of here.

It took a while for people to notice. Some of that was because I also cut off a beard that I‚Äôd worn for something like 35 years, so when people saw me, they‚Äôd know that *something* had changed, but they couldn‚Äôt quite figure out what. It was only when I went out in a far-too-big blazer that friends said, Wait. You‚Äôve lost like a lot of weight, haven‚Äôt you? And once that seal broke, it was all that some acquaintances would talk about. When they asked how I did it, I‚Äôve been not at all hesitant to talk about GLP-1s, and what and how they do it. I don‚Äôt hear a lot of judgement, but I do hear a lot of misunderstanding about obesity as a disease. May friends are encouraging; people who judge me are (pretty much by definition) not my friends ‚Äî and therefore don‚Äôt matter to me.

It‚Äôs apparently pretty dramatic. A month or so ago, I went to a concert featuring a friend I‚Äôve done music with for about 30 years, though I hadn‚Äôt seen her for a couple of years. When I went up to her after the show to chat, we talked for a minute or so before she introduced herself and asked my name. She legit did not recognize me.

Beyond the cost of the meds, I‚Äôve spent lots more money on clothes in the last year than I expected. I‚Äôm paying more attention to my appearance, so I‚Äôve invested in some made-to-measure shirts (check out Proper Cloth) and had a couple of suits and sports coats tailored down. I now have a tailor ‚Äî not something that was never on my bingo card. That stuff ain‚Äôt cheap. (I‚Äôd do more of them, but the nature of work has changed such so I really don‚Äôt have as many places to wear good clothes anymore.)

I‚Äôm still working through my relationship with food. I‚Äôm certainly eating less, and eating differently. I still love chocolate, although there‚Äôs still a box of Mallomars in the cupboard from October ‚Äî the half-life of a Mallomar box in my household used to be about 12 hours. I‚Äôm drinking less, and I never was much of a drinker (at least, not since long-ago college). I still eat too much in social situations. Resisting clean-plate syndrome is still a challenge; I try to fight that by putting less on my plate to begin with. It‚Äôs a particular problem in restaurants.

If there‚Äôs been one big roadblock, it‚Äôs in access to the medication itself.  For most of the first year, I was well covered by my wife‚Äôs insurance ‚Äî although even that required endless hoop-jumping and goalpost-moving by Express Scripts. Then my wife retired and I went on a Medicare Part D plan. Despite Zepbound being on the formulary, I was surprised to learn that Zep will not be covered under *any* Part D plan for weight loss. My doc is trying to work his way through that. If all else fails, I intend to go the Lilly Direct vial route and self pay. Expensive, but I‚Äôm fortunate enough to be able to afford it. I‚Äôm certainly not going back ‚Äî and it‚Äôs probably cheaper to pay for the med than pay for new fat clothes. I‚Äôll be damned if I redo my closet upwards.

For those in the early days of your GLP-1 journey, wondering if the discomfort and initial lack of results is worth it, I‚Äôm here to tell you Yes, it is. Find an encouraging doc, work the program, listen to your body, and tell the haters to go straight to hell (in your mind at least, if you can‚Äôt manage the courage to say it out loud). I heard a good distinction once: Zepbound is an anti-obesity medication, not a weight-loss drug. It‚Äôs an important difference. The latter sounds something one takes for cosmetic reasons or vanity. The former is medicine you take to treat a medical condition, not unlike a statin to control cholesterol. (And we could talk, too, about how medical science has also evolved in its understanding of why some people‚Äôs cholesterol levels are elevated.) Obesity is an illness/condition, not a choice. It‚Äôs not your fault. Stand tall and take the shot. 

Good luck.",13,1751224256.0,Zepbound,4,1.0,False
1lnmu31,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1lnmu31/best_first_episode_of_tos/,Best first episode of TOS?,"What do you think is the best episode to start watching Star Trek TOS? I would be interested in hearing what specific order ppl think is the best way to introduce someone who has never seen Star Trek to what the show is all about. I don't agree with anyone who says start with the best episodes - the best episodes are the best because they stand out from the crowd. You can't appreciate how good an episode like City on the Edge of Forever is until you've seen what Star Trek IS, and then you can get wowed by how amazing it can be when it's exceptional.

IMO the best single intro episode not just to TOS but to all Star Trek is an above-average run-of-the-mill episode: The Squire of Gothos. It doesn't usually make anyone's top 10 list, but it's still really good and it's full of so many things that serve as a window into this universe.

Here's an exhaustive list of all the reasons why I love this episode and think it's the best one to watch first (spoilers): 

-It's fun, it's funny, and it's filled with the themes that make Star Trek great
-It starts out with the crew getting coffee on the bridge and showing the personalities of Kirk, Spock and Bones, a very humanizing moment for all of them that reminds us they're still like us in the future
-You see the details of the operation of the ship, like assigning people to the landing party, having replacement officers take their station, turning on the transporter console
-The way Kirk instantly takes charge of the situation as soon as he's unfrozen - he is the undisputed captain
-We learn we are hundreds of years in the future (although not quite 900 years as they say in this early episode)
-""Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest."" Kirk explaining the values of Starfleet
-""Do you know that you are one of the few predator species that preys even on itself?"" Funny observation by Trelane
-The way Kirk introduces everyone and their roles: ""This is Mr. DeSalle, our navigator. Dr. McCoy, our medical officer. Mr. Sulu, our helmsman. And Carl Jaeger, meteorologist."" How cool that even the weathermen in the future get to go exploring alien planets! (Also pretty ridiculous Jaeger gets a first name on his one and only episode, but we don't hear Sulu's first name for another 25 years lol)
-""I'm a scientist, not a military man."" ""Oh, come now, we're all military men under the skin.""
-We learn the phaser has multiple settings: ""What an interesting weapon you've got there. Now let me see, how does this work? Oh yes, this won't kill, and this will."" *vaporizes a taxidermy*
-More alien observations about humanity: ""Oh, how absolutely typical for your species: you don't understand something, so you become fearful.""
-We learn how the transporter works: ""We, meaning I and others have, to state the matter briefly, perfected a system by which matter can be transferred to energy, and back to matter again."" ""Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise."" ""Oh, crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated process. You see, we not only transfer matter from place to place, but we can alter its shape at will.""
-Kirk's sense of duty: ""If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too. Our shipmates need us. We have tasks to perform.""
-We learn the crew compliment of the Enterprise: ""There are 400 men and women aboard that ship."" ""Women?!""
-Scotty getting his due as the guy who makes the Enterprise go: ""Scotty, we need every ounce of your engines. We're going to put 100 million miles between us and that madman."" 
-Spock explains his heritage in a hilariously tense exchange: ""Isn't quite human, is he?"" ""My father is from the planet Vulcan."" ""And are its natives predatory?"" ""Not generally. But there have been exceptions.""
-The way Kirk tells Trelane to ""Get off my ship.""
-The literary references: ""Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!""
-The way Spock tells off Trelane: ""I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose.""
-Trelane's comeback: ""Oh, Mr. Spock, you do have one saving grace after all: you're ill-mannered. The human half of you, no doubt.""
-Uhura being musical and playing the harpsichord (with a little help from Trelane)
-""Captain, how long do we go along with this charade?"" ""Until we can think our way out."" Classic Star Trek storytelling of outwitting the superior force, unlike modern Trek which is boom boom pew pew nonsense
-The historical references: ""You know I admire your Napoleon very much."" ""A matched set, just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton.""
-They call it ""Spacefleet Command"" cuz they still haven't figured out all the terminology by this point in the first season, but you get the reference to the command structure of Starfleet
-The nautical terminology of spaceflight: ""Hard to port, Mr. Sulu.""
-Scientifically correct terminology mixed with futuristic terminology: ""Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room.""
-This devastating insult by Kirk: ""You don't think, Trelane. That's your problem. You miss opportunities, like your anger before, and mine right now. And you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool.""
-We see Kirk's unwavering devotion to his duty: ""While we're playing our game, free my ship, let it continue on its way."" ""Always back to your ship...""
-A heroic Kirk stands with dignity even at the end of his life: ""So this is victory? There's a sweet taste. Down, captain. On your knees."" ""You haven't won, Trelane."" ""I have. I could run you through."" ""But you haven't won anything."" ""On your knees, captain."" ""NO. Does it still taste as sweet?"" ""I order you. You've been beaten!"" ""But I'm not defeated.""
-A classic sci-fi twist at the end, where we find out the god thing is just a child whose parents are gonna ground him for all this.

Other things I love:
-Throwback reference to M-113 salt vampire from The Man Trap
-Kirk puffing his chest with his pompous swagger to challenge Trelane to the duel. We get to watch Shatner act and then act like he's acting, and honestly he nails it.
-The way Kirk chooses to go face Trelane alone: ""Captain, you're not beaming down - "" ""Yes, I am, Dr. McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mr. Trelane, and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship. Stand by communications. Mr. Spock, if you don't hear from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once, no turning back."" He's just so in charge always.
-""I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane."" ""I warn you anything you might say has already been taken down in evidence against you."" ""I've come for one purpose: to get back my ship. We've made you angry with our will to survive, have we? Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the others.""
-""Where's the sport of a simple hanging? The terror of murder, the suspense, the fun."" Great thing to say to someone so deranged and obsessed with war and killing and that sort of thing, as Kirk thinks his way out of this situation.
-The moment Kirk realizes Trelane knows nothing and deserves to just be slapped in the face.

I watched a lot of TOS on DVD back in the day, but I never had this episode on disc, so I didn't really come to appreciate it until a few years ago. But wow, it is in my opinion one of the shining examples of how fun, thought out, and well written classic Star Trek was. It really sums it all up in 45 minutes.

1lnmsm2,https://i.redd.it/n6bvo8vf0x9f1.png,Visit to Yusuf Bhai Store Hyderabad,"I visited the much hyped newly opened ""King of Perfumes"" Yusuf Bhai store in Hyderabad. Smelled a good lot of perfumes and it was a letdown to say the least. Among the ones I tried are -

1. Imagination - Unsure its some other perfume diffused onto the strip as there were 10 other people requesting to test n number of frags. But there was fresh pineapple in the imagination. To double check, I even asked a friend for the same and he confirmed. Weird.

Now I own a small sample of Imagination and Aqua Dubai. YB version had zero soapy or tea smell.

2. Ombre Nomade - Pure Raw Oud. Nothing Rose, Raspberry, Sweet or Incense in this.

3. Tam Dao - Its smelled like Raw Wood like you break a branch out of a tree,  raw af

4. Blue De Chanel - This one felt ok, although it smelled the citrus on the forefront was synthetic af and everything else gets overshadowed by that and stays in the background. Tried it on the skin and same result.

5. Baccarat Rouge -  This one I was unsure what I was smelling, this one I have clones of it with me and smelled OG before, This was going totally in a fruity direction than a oriental floral of what is expected of a BR540 perfume. Weird again.

6. Aventus - CDNIM edt watered down. ü§£

Now, I never test a perfume's longevity but all the tester strips I used had zero smell after 5 minutes of sniff session. Used coffee to reset my nose and still nothing. On the contrary, recently I tested Guerlain L'Homme Ideal a week back in a mall and had that strip stored in my bag. It still had a sweet smell in it. Speak volumes.

One thing I realized today, once you smell the OG or even a good clone from a good middle eastern houses, these renditions will never come close. But again opinion is subjective.

The staff was helpful enough in the store and I got the BdC as a friend was hyped af and asked me to pick it up. They were out of the bottle so recreated it fresh. ",8,1751224131.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,5,0.9,False

Morning. Stillness. Discovery.

The morning after Night 22 felt off.

Not wrong, exactly‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ hesitant. Like the store was waiting.

The Slurpee machine didn‚Äôt hiss the way it usually did when shutting down its overnight cycle. The hot case didn‚Äôt fog. Even the morning sun looked a little washed out through the grime-slicked windows.

I stayed a little longer than I usually do after a shift. Lila had wandered off just before dawn without saying goodbye, and Miss had disappeared somewhere in the back‚Äîmaybe into the cooler, maybe into the ether. Hard to tell with her.

I was cleaning under the wire rack near the supply closet, thinking I might restock the coffee stirrers before heading out. That‚Äôs when I felt the floor shift.

Just a little. Like something underneath was moving.

The loose tile wasn‚Äôt loose yesterday.

I pried it up with a flathead screwdriver. Beneath the tile was a shallow wooden cavity, lined in blackened felt. And inside it‚Äî

A journal.

Rough leather. Thick stitching. Faintly warm to the touch. It didn‚Äôt feel like cowhide. Or pigskin. Or anything I‚Äôve ever known. It smelled like old paper, candle wax, ash, and something faintly metallic.

There was no title. No markings on the cover. Just weight.

The weight of things forgotten.

When I opened it, the pages looked blank‚Ä¶ at first. Then I tilted it under the harsh light of the back room, and the words shimmered up from the parchment in sickly gray ink.

Some in English. Some in languages I couldn‚Äôt recognize. And some, written in what looked like scratched charcoal, that rearranged themselves on the page when I blinked.

I didn‚Äôt get far before the overhead light buzzed once, then blew out.

The journal snapped itself closed.

And the store‚Ä¶ took a breath.

Night 23 ‚Äì The Hourless Night

Entry begins 9:57 PM

I clocked in early. I always do now.

The manager didn‚Äôt show. Not surprising.

The store was quieter than usual‚Äîeven for the night shift. Miss hadn‚Äôt appeared yet. Lila was late. That bothered me more than it should‚Äôve.

I put the journal under the counter.

At exactly 10:01 PM, the fluorescent lights flickered once‚Ä¶ and everything froze.

Every clock in the building stopped.

Even the second hand on my wristwatch stalled.

The air inside didn‚Äôt move.

Yet‚Ä¶ the automatic doors hissed open. A customer walked in. She smiled. Picked up a pack of gum. Paid in exact change. Said, ""Have a nice night."" And walked out.

Time hadn‚Äôt resumed.

But people were still moving.

I ran to Register Two. Opened the drawer. The bills were all gone.

In their place: a single antique clock hand, resting atop a crumpled receipt from 1971.

I pocketed the hand.

The receipt burst into blue flame and vanished.

10:07 PM (though no clock shows it):
A man entered wearing a suit made entirely of tiny mirrors. His mouth didn‚Äôt move when he spoke.

""Time is thin here. Don‚Äôt sell to the ones who rhyme.""

He walked into the candy aisle and dissolved like sugar in water.

Then came the rhymers.

Three customers entered at once. All in coats far too warm for the weather. Skin waxy. Eyes too bright. Smiling like ventriloquist dummies.

One said:
""Spilled some gas, need a can,
six bucks thirty from my van.""

Another added:
""My wife is cold, her lips turned blue,
do you sell something warm and new?""

The third just stood and grinned.

I reached under Register One, tore open the emergency syrup bottle, and soaked three receipts. Printed zeroed-out transactions. Handed them over.

They blinked in unison. Took the receipts. Smiled wider.

And left without another word.


---

Somewhere behind me, a clock began ticking again.

Just one.

The small wall clock over the coffee counter. Second hand moving‚Äîjerky and unsure, but alive.

I pulled the antique clock hand from my pocket and inserted it into the side of the wall clock.

It clicked into place like it belonged.

Time lurched.

The store groaned.

Everything resumed.

The lights flickered again, but stayed on. My watch ticked forward.

10:42 PM.


---

The register reads:

End of Legacy Rule Activation: The Hourless Night
Object used: Clock hand from drawer
Aftereffect: No footage captured on any camera between 10:01 and 10:42 PM. Time stamp frozen. No customers visible.

After Midnight

Miss appeared behind me without sound, her long legs half-covered by a shimmering coat made of something not quite fur.

""You opened something,"" she whispered.
""Did I?"" I asked.
She didn‚Äôt answer. Just looked at the journal beneath the counter and stepped back.

Later, Lila arrived. Her hair was longer than it was yesterday. She looked at the clock, then at me.

""You saw it, didn‚Äôt you?""

I nodded.

She just said, ""Don‚Äôt open any more pages. Not until the first frost inside.""

And she drifted away, humming something low and strange.

Indoor Playscape Edition,"This afternoon, I took my three kids (9, 7, and 4) to an indoor inflatable play places. After cursing under my breath while paying $15 per kid, I guided my kids to the shoe cubbies, and into the warzo...I mean play zone...While dodging toddlers and trying to not think too much about how I could feel the germs clinging to my body, I started watching the other dads.  Don't worry, I only made eye contact with 3 dads in 90 minutes and it was only a-lot-a-bit awkward. 

Anyway, it hit me that we all have very different methods of ‚Äúdadding‚Äù in these lawless, soft/hard-surfaced arenas. So I present to you: The 5 Dad Archetypes of the Indoor Play Place. I spent minutes crafting these archetypes based on years of my own field research.

I‚Äôve been all five at one point, but these days I‚Äôm drifting dangerously toward a solid B/C combo as I coast toward 40.

What about you? What‚Äôs your go-to dadding style in these chaotic warzones? And does your method change if your partner‚Äôs there too?


The choices...


A. Active Agent: Socks off, knees bruised, plastic/carpet buens, and sliding down headfirst while yelling, ‚ÄúCANNONBALL!‚Äù as you tumble down or odd something. You are the jungle gym. You may have lost a contact lens in the ball pit and your body will certainly hate you later, but it was totally worth it. 

B. The Sideline Supervisor: Rocking the classic dad stance (arms crossed, knees slightly bent, aor leaning on the wall), sipping coffee and offering sage wisdom like, ‚ÄúThat looks like a them problem"" as they unleash havoc on themselves, sibling(s) or random stranger kids.

C. The Ghost Dad: Finds a chair or bench and silently scrolls or listens to an audiobook. You reappear for snack time, bathroom emergencies, and unexpected injury reports...but only if/when they come to you first.

D. The Germaphobe Gladiator: Arrives with a fanny pack of sanitizers, sprays down every surface like it‚Äôs a crime scene, and still questions every sneeze within 30 feet. In the parked car before entering, the kids are told to report to you no less than 5 times for hand sanitizer. Regardless, at least one of you has a bug 12-24 hours later. 

E. The Chaos Co-Conspirator: Encourages your kid to break the posted rules ‚Äújust a little.'. Joins spontaneous games of tag/hide-n-seek with your kids and even with strangers‚Äô kids. You and/or your kid(s) get a warning from staff.",3,1751223816.0,daddit,1,1.0,False

1lnmjjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lnmjjd/lotus_part_one_static/,Lotus Part One: Static,"**Part One: Static**

I wake up to static. Not the metaphorical kind; actual static, the sound of a busted air vent coughing out a thumping *sput* right above my head. Its hum paints the soundtrack to my waking moments. It‚Äôs been doing that for three months now, maybe even four by now. I used to keep track of time, back when time had shape. Now it just leaks.

The mattress pad under me is thin enough to feel the floor through it. Concrete, cold even in summer. There‚Äôs mold creeping up the walls like it‚Äôs trying to escape the room. I guess I can relate. Somehow no matter what I do the room just smells like dust and mildew, like it is actively rejecting the idea of inhabitants altogether.

I sit up. Cough. Something dry and bitter in my lungs. Might be the dust. Might be the synthetic they spray through the ventilation to keep the rats from breeding in the walls. Either way, I cough every morning, and every morning it reminds me I‚Äôm still here.

Unfortunately.

The room‚Äôs about ten feet by six. It used to be a maintenance closet. Now it‚Äôs mine, because the building manager knows I won‚Äôt complain. He isn‚Äôt wrong. I pay rent in trade: half-day labor, odd tech jobs, sometimes just silence. Silence is valuable around here. You learn that when you‚Äôve got walls that are only one solid punch away from becoming windows into the next miserable life one room away. I got lucky. Half my walls are concrete. Plus, despite the closet, I somehow managed to get a window. Not bad. Beats the neighbors next door, right?

I shuffle to the mirror, cracked and fogged with age. My face doesn‚Äôt surprise me anymore. I stopped recognizing it a long time ago. Gaunt. Uneven stubble. Eyes like used batteries. I splash a little brown water on my cheeks and slap my face like it owes me something. It doesn‚Äôt. Nothing does.

I cough again.

Outside, the sky is sick. Constant green-gray glow from the upper-level ad towers. They installed the ads a few years ago to keep rent prices low. It seems to have had the opposite effect. The sun hasn‚Äôt touched the lower district in over a decade. If anything, all it‚Äôs done is brought more violence to the area, now hidden by ads for instant coffee and Neurolinks. Just filtered light through synthetic clouds and surveillance cameras that hum above the streets like bored angels.

The world‚Äôs a landfill of half-lived lives, at least from my angle. People don‚Äôt look at each other anymore. Not out of fear, just exhaustion. Everyone‚Äôs selling something; scrap, code, bodies, religion. I used to write code for a big tech firm. Good code. Tight, elegant systems. Now I sell patches. Quick fixes for broken things that should stay broken. It pays well enough though. It‚Äôs my last useable skill I have left in a world like this and luckily people are still paying up.

I head to the street. My boots crunch on broken glass. Some punk kid in a torn jacket tries to sell me something. It‚Äôs a tiny bottle, no label, no promise. Says it'll ‚Äúslow the world down.‚Äù I shake my head. I used to say no because I was trying to stay clean. Now it‚Äôs just because I can‚Äôt afford the fall. I barely have enough to get liquored up these days.

I keep walking and pass a man slumped against a wall, eyes half-shut, grinning. Not the usual dead-eyed kind of grin you get around here, this one‚Äôs too wide, too bright for the world around him. There is something off about him. His sign‚Äôs cardboard, soaked through, but the message is clean and deliberate.

‚ÄúBegin your awakening.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt ask for change. Just watches me go with that eerie smile like he already knows something I don‚Äôt. I half catch him open his mouth as I pass. There‚Äôs a hum in the back of his throat like he‚Äôs breathing out a word that hasn‚Äôt formed yet. I roll my eyes and keep moving. Everyone‚Äôs selling something. Even salvation, if you squint hard enough.

I get to the job hub around noon. Used to be a subway station, now it‚Äôs something of a shadow market lit by dying fluorescents. Vendors sling cheap repairs, burner phones, drugs, girls, and half-broken entertainment rigs. If you can‚Äôt get it here, you can‚Äôt get it. Period. The air smells like burnt plastic and stale piss. I settle behind a folding table with a stack of frayed cables and an old diagnostic tablet. People bring me whatever they‚Äôve fried; cheap headsets, modded consoles, knockoff brainwave readers. A guy drops off a busted learning unit and says he wants it to play porn while he sleeps instead of language lessons. I tell him it'll cost extra to clean out the junk code. He doesn‚Äôt even blink. Nobody does anymore.

I guess I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm here today though, at just this time and at just this hour.

Because despite the squalor and filth, halfway through my shift, I see her.

Evie.

This isn‚Äôt just some girl I used to know‚Ä¶ No. This is *the* girl. The only person I ever really let in. The one who tried to pull me out when everything started collapsing. The one who stayed long after she should‚Äôve run. And then she *did* run‚Ä¶ but not because she stopped loving me. Because I stopped letting her.

Fuck.

Seeing her makes my heart pound to life. Not like when there‚Äôs a knock at my door or some kindly stranger lifts his shirt to flash a piece. This pounding isn‚Äôt survival instinct. No, it‚Äôs emotion; bare, uninvited, and hard as bone. It feels foreign in my empty chest. There‚Äôs something so wrong about seeing her mixed in with a crowd like this.

She walks past the row of stalls, not seeing me at first. Her auburn red hair is tied back. She's wearing real clothes, clean and simple. Her shoulders aren't hunched like the rest of us down here. She's gliding in a way that makes my own existence feel like drowning. She still has a pulse. God, she still glows. What on earth is she doing here?

My breath catches. My hands go cold. For a second, I forget where I am. I forget the buzzing lights and the stink and the way my body always feels like it‚Äôs one bad meal from shutting down. All I see is her.

And then, by some miracle, she looks at me. Her eyes slice through the crowd, burning into me like the last flash of a dying sun.

They widen for just a breath. That moment. That flicker of recognition. It slams into me like a confession.

""Jace?""

My name in her voice‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt sound like pity. It sounds like a memory; still warm.

""Hey,"" I say, or try to. It comes out dry, hollow.

She steps closer. I can see her eyes scan me up and down. Her face taking it in; not with judgement, but with something much closer to concern. ""Jace, oh God it‚Äôs so good to see you. What are you..? I mean‚Ä¶ are you okay?""

I attempt a smile, but it breaks halfway. ""Define 'okay.'""

She gives a small, sad laugh. Same one she always gave when I tried to dodge a real conversation with a bad joke. I try to think of something to say. Anything.

‚ÄúYou look good Evie.‚Äù But it sounds wrong in my mouth. A compliment that sputters out like a dying muffler

She cocks her head, ""I didn‚Äôt expect I‚Äôd see you here.""

""Yeah, well. Gravity works different down here I guess. Hard to climb back up, you know?""

Fuck. Another joke.

She‚Äôs holding a paper bag; something stamped with a soup kitchen logo I vaguely recognize. I glance behind her and see a group of volunteers passing out food to the line outside the shelter. Of course. Of *course* she‚Äôs here feeding strangers. That was always her.

I guess neither of us have changed much.

She studies me. Really studies me. She isn‚Äôt judging. Just *seeing,* the same way she always had*.* That was Evie for you. Always seeing the parts of me I tried to hide and somehow not flinching.

""You look tired,"" she says, voice soft.

""I am.""

A pause. A real one.

""You should call me. Just to talk. If you want. I still‚Ä¶ you know. Think about you.""

And just like that, the static inside me goes quiet. No hum. No ache. Just a breath I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd been holding.

""Evie‚Ä¶""

She glances up, her green eyes meeting mine, her eyebrows lifted just slightly. That look that always meant *go on, say it.*

I open my mouth.

Close it.

My throat locks up like it forgot how to form anything honest.

""Take care,"" is all I manage.

She gives me this soft, half-smile. Like she knows I meant more. Like maybe she wishes I‚Äôd said it.

She hands me a small folded card. Handwritten number. A name I already know like a prayer I gave up on.

‚ÄúYou too Jace. I hope I hear from you soon. It was‚Ä¶ Nice to see you.‚Äù

Then she disappears into the crowd, back to her world of warmth and meaning and people who still know how to speak without flinching.

And then she‚Äôs gone, swallowed by the moving crowd, off to hand out warmth in plastic bowls.

I stare at the card for a long time.

I hold it at a distance like a shard of something holy I‚Äôm too dirty to touch.

I stand there for a while. Long enough for the crowd to thin, long enough for the street noise to fold back into unintelligible mush.

My fingers brush the card again. Part of me, some stupid, stubborn, still-breathing part, thinks about running to her right now. No plan, no pretense, just my feet dragging me towards something better.

My own inner voice screams out:

‚ÄúRun. Say something real. You idiot. She‚Äôs still here. She still sees you. Do something.‚Äù

I could go after her. I could call out her name. I could follow that thread back to whatever‚Äôs left of the person I used to be. I could let myself feel the losses I‚Äôd let pile up.

And maybe, for a second, I really mean to.

I stand up, my feet moving before my brain has time to process why. But then a screen above the vendor stalls flickers.

It glitches, static and color bleed, and resets into something new. It distracts me just along enough to give me pause.

On the screen, a woman appears.

Stunning, mid-30s, maybe. Too clean cut to be anything but manufactured. Smooth skin, narrow eyes, pinned-up hair with not a strand out of place, and a white lab coat so crisp it looks starched into obedience. Not a blemish. Not a twitch. She looks like an angel in the way a statue might‚Ä¶ flawless, inhuman, built to be worshipped but never touched. A messenger from some cold, clinical heaven I‚Äôd never touch. I don‚Äôt know what it is about *this* ad that holds me; what makes it cut through the flurry of noise that usually bounces off my skull until my eyes glaze over. But it does.

For a moment my eyes slip back to the crowd ahead. Evie‚Äôs gone. Lost in the shuffle like she had been all along. And I should be running after her. But I‚Äôm not. I let my eyes travel back to the glowing rectangle. I‚Äôm staring at a screen like it has answers. And maybe that‚Äôs worse. Not losing her. Not even letting her go. Just... doing nothing. Like always.

The woman before me is beautiful, sure, but not like Evie. It‚Äôs the kind that makes you uneasy. Like if you stared too long, you‚Äôd realize her smile never quite touches her eyes, but it somehow doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm drawn to the screen nonetheless.

And those eyes, God, those *eyes*‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt scan or blink or flicker. They just hold, like they‚Äôve already memorized everything broken about you. They look *through* the screen, past the static and neon and piss-stained concrete, straight into your skull. She sees me.

Behind her, the screen cycles through impossible imagery, all remnants of the past. Sunlight bleeding through pine trees, waterfalls over untouched cliffs, glowing fields of wheat that sway in slow motion. Like some lost Eden just waiting to be unlocked again.

She speaks.

‚ÄúThe human mind was not built for this world. The chaos. The static. The endless pressure to endure.‚Äù

A bird chirps in its nest.

‚ÄúWhat if suffering wasn‚Äôt necessary?‚Äù

An endless ocean.

‚ÄúWhat if peace was never meant to be earned, but to be fully experienced by all?‚Äù

A rainstorm.

‚ÄúAt Lotus, we‚Äôve developed a way to return the mind to its original frequency. Beyond pain, beyond thought. A state once reached only by the ancient mystics‚Ä¶ and now, by you.‚Äù

A monk prays against a setting sun.

‚ÄúYou are not broken. You are simply shut off. Closed.‚Äù

A child laughs as her father scoops her into his arms.

‚ÄúTranscend the body. Awaken the self. Experience Nirvana for yourself.‚Äù

An endless galaxy unfolds.

‚ÄúEnrollment in our experimental neural ascension trial is open now.‚Äù

The screen fades to white.

Her face lingers‚Ä¶ smiling, composed. Eyes locked. Just a moment too long.

Then: blackness.

A number appears.

Below it, a short message:

‚ÄúBegin your awakening.‚Äù

The words feel gentle. Like hands on my shoulders. But there‚Äôs something coiled beneath them, too polished. Too practiced. So, why am I still so drawn in?

I glance around. No one else is looking. No one else is *seeing.*

Just more hunched backs and dead eyes, trudging through their own quiet drownings.

But somewhere deep inside of myself I feel it. Like a wire pulling something loose inside me.

I don‚Äôt move. Don‚Äôt blink.

It‚Äôs not the vague offer of peace. We get enough offers like that around here. It‚Äôs not the flashy images, or the pseudoscience.

It‚Äôs her.

It‚Äôs the *certainty* in her voice. Like a preacher‚Äôs promise.

I jot the number on the back of Evie‚Äôs note, flinching as I do, like I‚Äôve stained something sacred.

But that night, for the first time in months, I sleep through.

I dream of rivers made of light.

Wheat fields, soft and endless.

A silence so deep it feels like being held.

And for the first time in a long time‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt wake up afraid.

Because in my dream, the rivers hum like static.",4,1751223526.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751223484.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751223474.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

Inside well along with some winter rules seasonal rules , there were also Legacy rules. And as always, welcome to the night shift

---

WINTER RULES

(These rules are active only during winter shift conditions. Do not confuse them with standard store rules. You will know when winter has begun.)


---

Rule 1: The Cold Hour
If the clock behind Register Two freezes at 4:07 AM and the minute hand twitches instead of ticking:

Place the metal tin of salt (found under the sink) in the center of the store.

Open the lid, but do not make a circle or pattern.

If a customer enters asking, ""Where did the other aisle go?""

Say, ""It‚Äôs being reorganized.""

Give them one citrus candy from the backup drawer under Register One.


When the clock resumes, sweep the salt outside. Burn it at sunrise.



---

Rule 2: The Forgotten Box
If you find a delivery box dated before the year you were born:

Do not open it inside the store.

Place it in the far-left corner of the walk-in cooler.

If it hums, place one peppermint candy on top.

If the box is still there by sunrise, call the red phone and say, ""Package persists.""

If the box is gone by sunrise, review roof camera footage only. Do not check interior tapes.



---

Rule 3: Breath on Glass
If you can see your breath inside the store and the temperature reads normal:

Check all windows.

If one has writing on it, do not clean it.

Read the message aloud once.

Place a coin in the Register Two box.

Wait ten minutes before looking at the window again.

If the message is gone, remain silent until 5:00 AM.



---

Rule 4: The Name Frost
If you see a name written in frost on the back room mirror:

Do not say the name out loud.

Cover the mirror with the emergency poncho from behind the door.

Lock the back room and leave it sealed until the name disappears.

If the name is still there at 6:00 AM, you may go home. Do not fall asleep.



---

Rule 5: The Voice in the Snow
If any unplugged device begins playing static that sounds like whispering:

Tune the store radio to 88.7 FM.

Say out loud: ""Only the root sleeps deep.""

The voice will give you one of three things:

A name ‚Äì write it down and carry it on you.

A place ‚Äì burn it before sunrise.

An emotion ‚Äì feel it until the shift ends. Do not suppress it.




---

Rule 6: The Ash Fall
If ash begins falling outside instead of snow:

Do not leave the store unless your full legal name is called.

If someone enters smelling of fire or smoke, give them hot coffee without speaking.

If they drink, observe their reflection in the window.

If the reflection drinks differently than they do, call the red phone and say, ""Ash Reflection Divergence.""




---

Rule 7: The Golden Slurpee
If the Slurpee machine dispenses glowing gold liquid:

Do not taste it. Do not cycle the machine.

If the ghost girl appears and seems afraid, follow her instructions without hesitation.

If she is absent, offer the Slurpee to the tall woman in the fur coat. Let her decide what to do.

If no decision is made, seal the red nozzle with the ""Lamb‚Äôs Breath"" sticker from the back room drawer.



---

Rule 8: The Ice Shelf
If you find frost forming on any shelf near Register Two, and a single product seems older than the rest:

Place that product in a brown paper bag.

Put it under the counter and tape it shut.

Do not sell, eat, or touch the product again.

The manager will handle it.



---

Rule 9: The Gloved Man
If a man wearing gloves, sunglasses, and no coat enters after 2:22 AM and asks for directions:

Tell him you are not allowed to give directions.

Offer him the weathered map in the drawer under Register Two.

If he refuses it, leave the store floor and go to the back.

Lock the door.

Do not come out until the door chime rings twice.



---

Rule 10: The Black Slurpee
If the Slurpee machine begins dispensing a black fluid that reflects no light:

Immediately place an ""Out of Order"" sign on the whole machine.

Call the red phone and say, ""Red Slurpee."" If they ask, clarify: ""No, it's black. It's‚Ä¶ wrong.""

Follow all instructions exactly.

If told to lock yourself in the back, do so.

Do not exit until the red phone rings again and gives you the clearance code.

Do not open the door for anything else.



---

Generational Rules

These occur rarely and only when certain conditions are met.


---

Rule 11: The Yearling Mirror
On the last full moon of the year, the mirror in the bathroom may show something other than your reflection:

Do not speak to it.

Leave the bathroom and lock the door.

If the mirror fogs over and you hear tapping from the inside:

Call the manager.

Say, ""We have a Yearling.""


Do not return until after sunrise.



---

Rule 12: The Sleeping Bell
If a wind chime is found hanging inside the store and no one knows who placed it there:

Carefully remove it and place it in the freezer.

If it begins to ring without wind, call the red phone and say, ""Sleeping Bell Event.""

Wait for further instruction.

Do not hum, whistle, or sing until it is removed.



---

Rule 13: The Midnight Feast
If a large table appears in the middle of the store with covered dishes and lit candles:

Do not lift any lids.

Do not take a seat if chairs are present.

If someone invites you to sit and eat, decline politely.

If they insist three times, go to the back room, lock the door, and wait.

The table will vanish before sunrise.

If it does not, leave through the walk-in cooler and do not return until the following night.

---

End of Winter Rules.

LEGACY RULES

Also referred to as Deep Time or Generational Protocols.
Discovered in a leather-bound journal found under a loose tile in the supply closet, behind a disused wire rack.

The journal smells of smoke, ash, oil, and something that might not be animal.
Its pages are stiff with age and fear.
Some are blank unless read under candlelight.
Others appear only when certain phrases are whispered aloud.


---

Legacy Rule 1: The Hibernal Host (Centennial Event)

If the store‚Äôs ice machine begins overflowing without being turned on, and a pale handprint appears on the ceiling above Register One:

Begin the Winter Watch.

Burn a clove of garlic and a sprig of pine behind each entrance.

Play the cassette labeled ‚Äú1975 Visitor Log‚Äù (found in the tape drawer you‚Äôre not supposed to open).

If a man in a funeral tuxedo arrives asking for ‚Äúthe annual review,‚Äù say:

‚ÄúThe store still remembers.‚Äù


Do not engage further.

Let him walk the aisles.

When he leaves, do not ring him up.

If he asks why you haven‚Äôt asked for payment, say:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already been paid.‚Äù


Lock the doors behind him, no matter what time it is.

Do not mention this night to anyone for one year and one day.



---

Legacy Rule 2: The Candle Moth (Every 88 Years)

If a moth larger than your hand appears, flickering like a flame and circling the overhead lights:

Turn off every light in the building.

Light the emergency candle stored in the box labeled ‚ÄúProperty of Southland Ice Delivery Co.‚Äù

Place it on the counter.

The moth will land once. Do not flinch.

When it flies away, it may leave behind:

A burnt photograph.

A feather with writing on it.

A metal coin that hums.


Do not touch these objects until after sunrise.

If you touch them early, you are no longer you.



---

Legacy Rule 3: The Toll Keeper (Once per Century, Always in Winter)

If a small toll booth materializes in the middle of the store and a voice says, ‚ÄúExact change only‚Äù:

You must find a coin from the year of the last recorded death in the store.

If you do not know when that was, call the red phone and whisper: ‚ÄúI need the ledger.‚Äù

Slide the coin under the door of the toll booth.

Do not ask what the toll is for.

If you hear a child laughing from inside, leave the store.

Lock the doors. Do not return for two nights.



---

Legacy Rule 4: The Root Below (Possible Millennial Rule)

This rule was only partially translated. Appears in old Gaelic, fragments of Latin, and a scratched symbol that looks like a tree with human teeth instead of fruit.

What‚Äôs known:

If black roots appear beneath the freezers, spreading fast, and you smell something like vinegar and rot:

Place one item from each Slurpee flavor in a ring.

Leave a drop of your blood in the center.

Speak no words.

Close the store early, no matter what the system says.

Go home.

Sleep outside if you can.

Do not dream of the store.


If you do, you won‚Äôt wake up alone.



---

Legacy Rule 5: The Hourless Night (Bicentennial ‚Äì Rare Trigger: Leap Year + Winter Solstice)

If all clocks in the store stop, and time appears not to move for you‚Äîbut customers are still coming in:

You are in the hourless night.

Check the register drawer. If there is a clock hand where the bills should be, put it in your pocket.

You will need it to exit.

Any customer who speaks in rhyme must not be allowed to purchase anything.

Distract them. Talk nonsense. Ring up $0.00 and hand them a receipt soaked in Slurpee syrup.


To escape the hourless night, return the clock hand to the first wall clock that starts ticking again.

If no clocks resume, you must become the clock.

That part‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt explained.



---

NOTES LEFT IN THE MARGIN

These were scrawled in the back of the journal in jittery ink. Possibly by a former night employee. Possibly by something else.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt accept any package that has moss on it. Not again.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf someone knocks and asks for the year, do not answer truthfully.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe girl with the glass face isn‚Äôt real, but don‚Äôt tell her that.‚Äù

‚ÄúLila wasn‚Äôt the first. She‚Äôs just the last one who stayed.‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss used to speak more. Before the Candle Moth.‚Äù

---

I'm not sure what to make of these new rules, I wish the manager would actually answer questions. I wish I knew what happened to the ones before me. For now, so I guess I'll just continue doing what I do. Next time I'll follow up with night 23, and as always, welcome to the night shift.

Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751223452.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn‚Äôt pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria‚Äîand my motivation‚Äîwere on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn‚Äôt promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I‚Äôd tried before‚Äîand that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

The idea came from my own frustration as a home barista: I‚Äôd tweak grind size, dose, and brew settings for different beans, but could never remember what worked. So I decided to build an app to keep track of it all.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751223421.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751223397.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn‚Äôt pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria‚Äîand my motivation‚Äîwere on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn‚Äôt promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I‚Äôd tried before‚Äîand that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight‚Äîno skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit‚Ä¶ or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

I am 25 and I‚Äôve only had like 2 very short relationships so not a lot of experience and I didn‚Äôt get into my first relationship until I was 18 so yeah. I would say I am a very affectionate person, I love physical touch as a form of showing my love or especially receiving it. I found the guys I was with before could never ever scratch that itch I had or satisfy my needs so I have been constantly just craving this certain form of affection. 
I‚Äôve been through a lot of hardship in my childhood so from 21-24, I was in some serious therapy and did a lot of work and healing on myself. I learned to love myself, love spending time with myself, I enjoy the qualities I bring to my life and others, and I learned how to set up personal boundaries so I‚Äôm not letting toxic and unworthy men into my life.

I got a new job which really sets me up for my career so I feel like in terms of everything else besides a relationship, I am set up and doing really well. I have a nice car, a nice home, a secure job, etc. I just deeply crave love now. 
I was driving to my local coffee shop today and out of no where, this deep, deep craving for love and affection from a man just hit me like a tidal wave. It felts like an ache or need that I just can‚Äôt get or an itch that cannot be reached or scratched. 
When I kind of vent or speak about this issue I am having to someone close in my life, I am always told ‚Äúyour time will come, just be patient. Your person will come and satisfy all your needs‚Äù. I want a family and I want my person but I am 25 so I feel like my time for creating my family is starting and will come to an end before I even realize, that maybe it will be to late for me. 
This also might sound shallow but again, I got nothing left to loose, but I also want to be with someone I find attractive, someone I want. Sometimes I get vibes from guys that I chat to everyone now and then and I get the vibe that maybe they are interested in me but I just don‚Äôt feel attracted to them. But I feel like someone would tell me ‚Äúwell there you go, guys are wanting you but your just so picky‚Äù so idk I‚Äôm just frustrated and feel like a crack head with these cravings I get",13,1751223223.0,TrueOffMyChest,7,1.0,False

The 3am drives to nowhere with Iced Coffee in hand.
The thailay walay fries that somehow fix your mood.
The honking that never stops, the power cuts that test your faith, the sea breeze that arrives just in time to save your sanity.
You curse this city a hundred times a day and still can‚Äôt imagine a life without it.

Because somehow, between the concrete and the cracks, Karachi becomes part of your wiring.
It‚Äôs unforgiving, unpredictable but full of soul. A kind of madness that teaches you how to survive.
Where strangers become friends over chai. Where every sunset over the sea feels like a small apology for the day.

And yet‚Ä¶ do you ever catch yourself thinking:
What if I lived somewhere else?
Somewhere calmer. Where the nights are quiet and the roads make sense.
Maybe Islamabad‚Äôs stillness. Lahore‚Äôs warmth. Or even some small town that doesn‚Äôt smell like smoke and heartbreak.

If you have thought about it, where do you see yourself?
And how do you think someone who was raised in Karachi, loud, loyal, street smart and always slightly on edge adjusts to a place that doesn‚Äôt demand that kind of grit?

Not here to start a city war. Just wondering if anyone else feels that weird guilt, that if you ever did leave, it would feel less like moving‚Ä¶ and more like abandoning a part of yourself.

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751223150.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

1lnmdh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lnmdh3/should_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_be_the_braun/,Should the best drip coffee maker be the Braun BrewSense KF6050WH,"I‚Äôve been using the Braun BrewSense KF6050WH on a daily basis, testing all its features to brew my morning coffee exactly the way I want it. This drip coffee maker isn‚Äôt just any appliance; it‚Äôs designed to make brewing coffee a smoother, more enjoyable experience. Its combination of sleek design with innovative features makes it stand out in a crowded market, but as with most products, there‚Äôs a mix of good and less-than-ideal aspects.

**Elegant and Compact Design**

This coffee maker‚Äôs aesthetic caught my eye right away. The sleek white finish combined with a compact profile means it fits perfectly on smaller countertops and doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the kitchen. I‚Äôve even tucked the cord neatly using the built-in cord storage, reducing countertop clutter. The glass FlavorCarafe looks elegant, and it has a comfortable grip, which is something you‚Äôll appreciate during those groggy, early-morning pours.

That said, I do think the buttons on the control panel could have been slightly more intuitive, especially for first-time users. While the LED display is crisp and easy to see from across my kitchen, it did take me a couple of tries to figure out the programming!  

**Pure Flavor Technology Works Wonders**

The Braun BrewSense features what they call ‚ÄúPure Flavor Technology,‚Äù and honestly, I noticed the difference. Every cup comes out tasting robust and flavorful. Whether I brewed a single mug or a full pot, the coffee retained its rich aroma and depth. When I measured the water carefully with the unique level indicator and paired it with their gold-tone filter, the results were exceptional. Unlike paper filters, this reusable one allowed crucial coffee oils to reach my cup, which added an extra flavor punch.

If you‚Äôre someone who experiments with grind sizes, this coffee maker might require some tinkering. I noticed extraction varies a bit if the grind size isn‚Äôt just right, so you might need to reprogram for optimal results.

**Wake up to the Aroma**

This device comes with a 24-hour programmable timer, which means my coffee was ready when I shuffled into the kitchen half asleep. There‚Äôs nothing quite like the smell of freshly brewed coffee greeting you in the morning! The automatic shutoff feature brought peace of mind, and the easy-to-read clock made setting the timer surprisingly stress-free. 

[Check Braun KF6050WH BrewSense price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07cpjf2bg/)  

**Brew Pause and Freshness**

One of the best features is the brew-pause system. There were countless mornings where I couldn‚Äôt wait for the entire pot to brew. I was able to pour a cup mid-cycle without worrying about a mess ‚Äì no drips, no stress. The FlavorCarafe seals in freshness remarkably well, ensuring the coffee stays delightful even if I returned for a second cup an hour later. 

On the flip side, the capacity of twelve cups seems great, but it might not fully extract the same quality when brewing smaller amounts. While the 1-4 cup setting helps a bit with this, I personally found the taste a tad diluted compared to brewing a full pot.

**Smarter Design Elements**

This coffee maker shows Braun‚Äôs attention to detail. From its lower profile to the smaller countertop footprint, every element feels thoughtfully designed. Setting it up was a breeze, and the charcoal water filter ensures my water quality isn‚Äôt compromising the taste. The customizable cleaning feature is another bonus, especially since I reside in an area with hard water.

However, one minor gripe is the lack of a removable water reservoir. I found myself wishing it was detachable for easier refilling directly at the sink.

**Merits**

- The compact footprint easily fits into most kitchens without dominating the space.
- Gold-tone reusable filter enhances the coffee flavor by allowing oils to seep through.
- Programmable timer ensures coffee is fresh and ready each morning.
- Brew-pause system prevents messy drips and lets you pour anytime.
  
**Drawbacks**

- Buttons and setup might feel unintuitive for first-time users.
- Coffee quality isn‚Äôt consistent when brewing smaller quantities.
- Lacks a removable water reservoir, which would simplify refilling.

**Competing Products**

Having compared it to other drip coffee makers like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and the Ninja CE251, the Braun BrewSense KF6050WH offers slightly superior flavor extraction due to its Pure Flavor Technology. The gold-tone filter is a standout, whereas competitors often rely on disposable paper filters, which muddle coffee richness. On the other hand, the Cuisinart model offers a slightly larger capacity and a detachable reservoir, which some users might prefer for convenience, whereas the Ninja excels in faster brewing times.

If you value consistently rich coffee flavor and a compact, visually appealing design, this coffee maker edges out its rivals. It does fall short in water reservoir practicality compared to competitors, but that‚Äôs minor if flavor depth is your top priority.

**Affordable Quality**

Given the daily use this coffee maker has seen while testing, I genuinely feel it provides excellent value for money. You‚Äôre not just paying for a coffee maker; you‚Äôre investing in something that enhances coffee quality while looking stunning on your kitchen counter. While some may balk at other options with additional features, I found that the premium flavor and the fresh aesthetic make this worth its price tag.

I'm more productive during the night and find it really difficult to consistently feel productive in the morning.

I've been trying to ""shift"" my circadian rythm for a few months, on and off. I've been going to bed early and getting up before 6am for a few weeks now. While it's difficult to wake up initially, when I force myself I'm able to feel alert after about half an hour and a coffee routine.

All this definitely goes against my body. I'm forcing it. I've found that I could be getting up early for weeks at a time but all I need is one or two days of missing it and my routine is fucked up again!

I understand that I don't have to do this. However, the occasional productive mornings feel really good! I also have other reasons to be wanting to get up and start the day early. When this is the case, I want to keep going until I know for CERTAIN that it will never work for me. I'm willing to go with this for another month of not missing a single day before I come to that conclusion.

My question: has anybody been able to shift their body clock and not needed to force it after a while, and most importantly, felt it has made their life more productive as a result?

P.S. I've read a few books about habits, and the book Why We Sleep from Matthew Walker. Even that book doesn't answer my question. It talks about consistency and how that will lead to a shift but it still doesn't conclusivley say whether this will stick and whether it affects productivity.",3,1751223052.0,sleep,4,1.0,False

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand‚Äôs official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure‚Äîjust 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751222945.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

So, I decided to go all in.

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!
* **Archery**: I shoot at things, sometimes I hit them
* **DIY**: Bought a house 2 years ago, and might have finally run out of DIY. You get bonus points if you correctly guess how many holes the previous owners drilled for a single shelf
* **Pianist**: Occasionally the noises I make sound like anime songs
* **Reading**: I'm in my psychology/mental health/self-development/productivity phase. The Solo Leveling omnibus novel is also looking at me menacingly
* **Technology**: A general interest in computers, which ranges from gaming to building computers to home servers. And my day job is hacking
* **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: The usual culprits like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings
* **Japanese**: Plan to travel to Japan one day and would like to be at least conversationally proficient
* **Being a functional adult**: Cooking, cleaning, ironing, I can do it all. If I don't know something, I'll go learn
* Making lists and collecting hobbies...

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Homeowner with a stable job breaking computers
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con

Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking, vaping and drugs are dealbreakers
* Looking for someone at a similar stage in life and generally set my age preference on dating sites to 25 - 33. Not a dealbreaker though if the vibe is good
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

I feel so ugly and tired and disgusting. 

It took me an hour to heat up pasta sauce and make spaghetti. I don't even know how that is possible. 
I am eating it now. It's disgusting. And the bowl is so hot. Nuclear hot like McD coffee and I don't know why and i can't hold it so I can eat and it is making me want to cry. 
My toes are cold. That also makes me feel extremely aggravated.  

I am moving house. The new place is being renovated and running over time. 
The builder is a nightmare and I can't deal with speaking to him anymore.
The neighbours have complained EVERY SINGLE DAY and I really can't anymore. 
I don't even want to live there anymore.

My husband is exhausted from my behaviour and really can't be bothered with this whole thing anymore. 
I don't blame him.
I also just want to get a divorce because it is horrible to have to be so horrible all day. 

But I actually can't help it. 
Hard to describe exactly where it hurts. 

I saw my teenage neighbour cry/whinge/scream at her mother the other day and that feeling is exactly the one I have... and it's just not going. And it makes me want to shave my head like Britney. 
Ruin the complaint neighbours life. Just make that my goal in life. 
I want to smash up my TV with a bat or whatever stick I can find. It is not working because the internet is not working and don't even with that! 
I want to throw something through a closed widow! 
I want to go hang myself in the woods.
I want to peel my skin off because it 'feels wrong'.
The seam in my dress is making me so uncomfortable and distressed I want to tear it apart with my bare hands. Whilst screaming off the top of my lungs. 

Yes. That is what it is like this time for me. 
I don't know what to say. 
I had to write this down to try to figure out myself what is going on.

Discovering Mitolyn ‚Äì Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who‚Äôs been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery ‚Äúenergy‚Äù or no response at all. And I‚Äôd grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn‚Äôt your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic ‚Äúwellness booster‚Äù making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function‚Äîthe part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand‚Äôs focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn‚Äôt seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn‚Äôt about masking fatigue with stimulants‚Äîit was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine‚Äîcompounds I‚Äôd heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people‚Äîmen and women over 30, 40, even 60‚Äîwere saying the same thing: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect it to work. But it did.‚Äù

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn‚Äôt looking for a miracle‚ÄîI just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 ‚Äì Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn‚Äôt disappear dramatically, but one day I realized‚ÄîI was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month‚Äînothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy‚Äîbut real.

Month 2 ‚Äì Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn‚Äôt changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# [‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolynseller)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn‚Äôt just about weight‚Äîit was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 ‚Äì A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective‚ÄîI could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn‚Äôt experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn‚Äôt just give me results‚Äîit gave me momentum. I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúon a supplement.‚Äù I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751222690.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False
1lnm70x,https://i.imgur.com/IftzwOZ.jpeg,"Dark Chocolate Yogurt Pudding (10g carbs, 13g fat, 5g protein, 190 cals per 85g serving)","I've been messing around with those two viral recipes for ""2 ingredient chocolate fudge"" (chocolate and greek yogurt) and ""1 ingredient chocolate mousse"" (chocolate and boiling water), and landed on a combined recipe that is super easy, one-bowl (no blender, hand mixer, double boiler, or ice bath needed) and has a really nice flavor and texture. 

I haven't officially started my GD diet yet (still waiting for an appointment with Nutrition), so **please let me know if this seems GD friendly**! I'll also add, since I haven't started my GD diet, this is legitimately something I consider tasty enough to eat (*especially* for the low effort) even if you don't need to be watching your carbs. 

  
Ingredients: 

* 200g good-quality dark chocolate 70% cocoa solids (I used Valrhona feves) 
* 200g boiling water or coffee (I used a double shot of espresso and then boiling water up to 200g) 
* 200g whole fat greek yogurt (I used Fage)
* sea salt and vanilla extract to taste 



Method:  

1. If using a bar of chocolate, chop or break up into smaller pieces. Put into a bowl and pour the boiling water/coffee on top. Let stand for 1 minute, then whisk until smooth. 
2. Whisk in vanilla extract and salt
3. Whisk in greek yogurt (straight from fridge is fine) about a third at a time
4. Portion and chill for 1-2 hours



Nutrition Info: 

I split the total recipe into 7 portions of about 85g each. Per 85g serving,

* 190 calories 
* 5g protein 
* 10g carbs
* 13g fat 

  
Other Thoughts: I haven't had a chance to try these variations yet, but some ideas to try!

* I think if you prefer peanut butter to coffee flavor, you could use a tablespoon or two of peanut butter in the first step. Chopped nuts or cacao nibs could add some nice texture. 
* If you enjoy Mexican hot chocolate, I think you could omit the coffee and add a bit of cinnamon
* Peppermint extract might be nice
* For more protein balance, you could top each serving with a mix of PB and Greek Yogurt (I did that for one serving and found it very nice) 
* If you prefer a chocolate-cheesecake type flavor, you could try replacing the yogurt with blended cottage cheese and I think omit the salt (but I am too lazy to clean a blender for something like this)",4,1751222673.0,GestationalDiabetes,0,1.0,False

1lnm6cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1lnm6cu/zyns_nicotine_and_effects_on_the_spine/,"Zyns, Nicotine, and Effects on the Spine","Hello everyone. I found this community a few weeks ago and I wanted to share some experience in hopes of some interesting conversation and perhaps a deterrent to help people keep off of these things.

I started using Zyns in late April this year to quit casually smoking cigarettes. Many of my friends and coworkers smoke, so as a former smoker, I would justify the occasional cigarette by saying ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not buying packs, so it doesn‚Äôt count‚Äù. I eventually decided to kick the smoking since Zyns were tobacco free and I could still get a nicotine fix. 

As a big coffee drinker I‚Äôve always had a high tolerance to caffiene, so I quickly upped my Zyn intake to an unhealthy level upwards of 15 3mg pouches a day, sometimes 2 in my mouth at a time. There were no warnings of an upper limit on the container, so I figured whats the big deal? It helped me get through tough work days.

At the same time I was also doing a workout routine focused on compound movements including pullups. I am 2.5 years into strength training and in the best shape of my life. 

One day I wake up with a stiff neck and I think, okay maybe I did too many pull-ups yesterday. Fast forward a few weeks and I can barely function. My upper back pain is so severe that I can barely get out of bed. My gums are so painful it feels like I have chemical burns even in places I never packed the Zyns. The pain started in my neck and quickly began sprawling out from my upper back and neck into my shoulder blades and eventually made its home mainly in my right shoulder black, shoulder, and all the way down my arm to my elbow and fingers.

I then find threads on this subreddit detailing the exact same pains and lots of anecdotes about stopping the Zyns and the pain going away within days to weeks. My problem was that I quit and for two weeks there was no improvement. I began thinking that there was some sort of nerve damage done from chemicals in the Zyns that had affected me permanently. Many other users on the thread described months to years of undiagnosable pain and linked it to the Zyn. I started to fear that I had done irreversible damage.

I finally saw the right doctors and they concluded that it was a standard case of a herniated disk in the neck. This tracked and the sequence of events from the initial stiff neck to prolonging symptoms lined up with how I didn‚Äôt do anything I should have been doing following a traumatic neck injury. I am now finally experiencing relief on a course of steroids and muscle relaxers, and the healing should continue.

My thoughts are this‚Ä¶

The way nicotine is a vasoconstrictor and stimulant has a triple effect on spinal health. First, there are studies linking nicotine to deterioration of the spine and bone health in general. Secondly, as a stimulant, it causes jaw tightness and clenching for prolonged periods of time, which can affect the nerves and muscles around the neck and upper-back; especially when taking Zyns in slouched positions. Lastly, the way nicotine is absorbed by the method of Zyn is slow and prolonged rather than rapid bursts like from smoking, which will cut off circulation and nutrient absorption for longer periods of time, causing rapid degeneration to muscles and bones. This leads me to believe that the reason so many people have been linking Zyns to these horrible shoulder blade and back pains is because of the trifecta affect listed above. I believe Zyns ultimately increase the likelihood of disc and spinal health degeneration. 

I went from excellent spine health and peak physical health performance to basically disabled after 6 weeks of heavy Zyn use with no other major lifestyle changes.

Does anyone else think there is a causal link here? I hope others who are suffering can read this and know that there is a cure and that the pain can and will go away if you cut out the Zyns and heal yourself properly.",6,1751222629.0,QuittingZyn,5,1.0,False

I know the city‚Äôs changed a lot, and my sweet (and concerned) mama keeps warning me that ""Philly‚Äôs not the same as it used to be."" I get it, but my instinct says that during the day, with a clear route, we‚Äôll be fine. Still, I‚Äôd love¬†**honest local input**‚Äîespecially about the vibe in 2024‚Äì25 and any¬†**safety tips**¬†for families during the day.

‚û°Ô∏è Mural Mile  
‚û°Ô∏è Reading Terminal Market  
‚û°Ô∏è 15th Street Subway

‚û°Ô∏è Spring Garden Station  
‚û°Ô∏è The Rail Park

‚û°Ô∏è 30th Street Station (loop back)

We‚Äôd also love to stumble into¬†**live music**¬†(I know DnB daytime shows are rare, but even something vibey or unexpected would be amazing). Any suggestions?

Would love to hear your thoughts:

* Any must-see murals or hidden art stops we should catch along the way?
* Where‚Äôs the best coffee or iced tea near these spots?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Prediction for New York Liberty vs. Atlanta Dream (June 29, 2025)**  
*The New York Liberty, still reeling from their recent loss to the Phoenix Mercury and minus Jonquel Jones (ankle), are about to face the Atlanta Dream, who are 0-2 in their last two games but at least have a full roster. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a Sabrina Ionescu three-pointer‚Ä¶ or at least the intention of one.*

### Key Stats & Odds

* **Moneyline**: New York Liberty (-105) vs. Atlanta Dream (-115). The Liberty are the slight chalk here, but let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîJonquel Jones‚Äô absence is like losing your starter‚Äôs coffee before tip-off.
* **Spread**: Liberty -1.5 (-110) / Dream +1.5 (-110). Atlanta‚Äôs recent offensive struggles (scoring just 78 points in their last two games) might make this spread a tightrope walk.
* **Total**: 165.5 points (Over -110 / Under -110). With the Liberty‚Äôs porous defense (2nd-worst defensive rating) and Atlanta‚Äôs shaky offense, the Under might be the safer bet‚Ä¶ unless Brittney Griner decides to dunk on everyone.

### Player Props to Watch

1. **Kahleah Copper 2+ 3-Pointers Made (-145)**  
*Why?* The expert‚Äôs pick here is a masterstroke. Copper is a 35% three-point shooter this season, and with the Liberty relying on perimeter shooting to compensate for their missing bigs, she‚Äôs due for a hot night. Bet her to hit at least two triples‚Äîunless she‚Äôs too busy flexing her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the best‚Äù vibes.
2. **Napheesa Collier OVER 8.5 Rebounds (-130)**  
*Why?* Collier is a rebounding machine (9.2 RPG this season). Even without Jonquel Jones, her 6‚Äô5‚Äù frame and relentless hustle should dominate the glass. The Dream‚Äôs frontcourt isn‚Äôt exactly a wall of bricks‚Äîexpect Naps to clean up.
3. **Sabrina Ionescu Assists (Over 4.5, -146)**  
*Why?* The Liberty‚Äôs point guard is averaging 5.8 assists per game. With Natasha Cloud and Sabally needing dimes, Ionescu should flirt with double-digit dishing.
4. **Brionna Jones Points/Rebounds (Over 20.5/10.5, -120)**  
*Why?* The Dream‚Äôs star center is a double-double machine (18.1 PPG, 10.3 RPG). If she‚Äôs not dropping 20/10, someone‚Äôs probably broken the WNBA‚Äôs physics.

### Final Verdict

The Liberty‚Äôs stacked backcourt (Sabrina, Stewart, Cloud) should outshoot the Dream‚Äôs inconsistent offense, while Napheesa Collier‚Äôs rebounding and Kahleah Copper‚Äôs three-pointers tilt the game in New York‚Äôs favor. **Take the Liberty (-105)** and back Collier OVER 8.5 boards.

*Bonus Prop Bet*: Will Sabrina Ionescu‚Äôs pre-game warmup include a TikTok dance? **Yes (1000 odds)**. Probably not, but it‚Äôs worth the risk.

*Stay tuned for the postgame analysis‚Ä¶ or just blame the ‚Äúbad bounce.‚Äù* üèÄüî•

‚ÄúCome down to my office and we will explain everything‚Äù responded Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúFine all five of us‚Äù.

Newsome agreed. The five of them walked into Newsome‚Äôs isolated office. Liam stared at the ground,¬† looking very uncomfortable.¬†

Michael had felt sick to his stomach. He had allowed something traumatizing to happen to Cain once. These people he was with, if he had any suspicion they were part of the kidnapping, he was going to go hands on. They entered Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office and Mr. Newsome began talking.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Vortox, your son Liam was snooping around my classroom and started yelling profanities as a joke.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust why the hell would he do that? Where‚Äôs Cain?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe ran out the school doors, I think your son Liam riled him trying to play jokes.‚Äù

Barnliver chimed in ‚ÄúYes I think we will have to discipline them when we get Cain back. Probably after school detention for both of them.‚Äù¬†

Michael stared at both of them. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like something either of them would do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam‚Äôs actually had a history of horseplay last year and the year before‚Äù

Michael sighed and began to walk around the office. He knew his boys weren‚Äôt perfect but if words had a scent, this would be bullshit.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse to make them do after school detention. Would they get out of school detention?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want your children in school Mr. Vortox?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be honest, I don‚Äôt trust the three of you right now, I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†

Newsome grabbed a bag and started digging around. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt trust me, I will get all the logs that shows the progress Cain has been making.‚Äù¬†

Michael looked around his office and saw data logs on his computer. There were logs of ‚Äúdistances variable could fly‚Äù, ‚Äúfire variable‚Äù ,‚Äúobjects variable can move‚Äù. Michael was horrified. This wasn‚Äôt a classroom.¬†

Newsome‚Äôs eyes grew wide. He had been sloppy. How could he have left that up? He set the bag down and grabbed another. He began to maneuver around behind Michael and next to Liam.

Michael glared at Mr. Barnliver and growled ‚ÄúJust what the fuck operation are you-

Mr. Newsome shuffled through the bag and pulled out a pistol with a silencer on it and shot Michael in the back of the head. Michael‚Äôs entire body shook and straightened out momentarily. Blood sprayed the wall and Mr. Barnliver. Michael‚Äôs body fell to the ground. Liam screamed and swatted the gun out of Newsome‚Äôs hand. Liam and Newsome both dove on the ground wrestling for position to grab the pistol. Mr. Barnliver ran over and picked up the pistol. Newsome yelled ‚ÄúFinish him!‚Äù¬†

Barnliver pointed the gun at Liam as lay crying on the floor. His finger went to the trigger when something zoomed into the room and hit Barnliver with such force that they went through the wall. Liam heard footsteps from the opposite end of the room¬† and looked back. It was Geraldson. Geraldson stared at Michael‚Äôs body while a pool of blood began to flow underneath. Liam crawled out of the office. He couldn‚Äôt look at his dad‚Äôs body any longer.¬†

‚ÄúYou are all under arrest‚Äù commanded Officer Gerald. ‚ÄúLiam go outside.‚Äù Liam nodded and began to run out.¬†

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù a voice rang out from the hole in the wall. Mr. Barnliver‚Äôs severed head was tossed through a hole in Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLiam are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain stay in there!‚Äù¬†

Cain walked out. Glared at Newsome and Shultz who looked visibly frightened. Cain looked down at his dad‚Äôs body. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He grew red.¬†

‚ÄúShoot him, he's the dangerous one!‚Äù Shultz yelled out pointing at Cain.¬†

Cain grabbed her arm and snapped it into two. Ms. Shultz opened her mouth to scream but Cain grabbed a coffee mug sitting on the desk and shoved it down her throat. Muffled screaming came out of Ms. Shultz‚Äôs stuffed throat. Geraldson yelled for Cain but Cain waved his hand and set him flying back twenty feet.¬†

‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE!‚Äù yelled Cain in a deep voice unlike his own. Newsome began to run out of his office but Cain sent a force into his left knee making it unusable. Cain lifted both of them and threw them through the gymnasium doors. Geraldson ran and hit the fire alarm. This was going to get ugly if he didn‚Äôt get the other students out of the building. Cain levitated a foot off the ground and floated into the gymnasium. Officer Riddle ran around the corner and saw Cain floating and two other adults floating. ‚ÄúCain stop or I will have to shoot!‚Äù Cain waived his hand and tipped the bleachers on top of Officer Riddle. Cain screamed which shook the entire school. Officer Geraldson ran outside and directed the other officers to evacuate the other students. Cain ripped off Ms. Shultz‚Äôs limbs from her torso and threw the pieces to the side. It was just him and Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way Cain. We can get away from this.‚Äù¬†

Tears flew from Cain‚Äôs face as he roared ‚ÄúYou killed my father!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe world can be yours Cain.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt already is.‚Äù¬†

Cain lifted his hands and set Newsome on fire. Newsome screamed as he became a floating human torch. Cain screamed back as he made the fire hotter and hotter. Then Cain screamed and blew roof off of the gymnasium. Still levitating, Cain levitated down the halls of the school destructing the windows, walls and whatever stood in his way.¬†

Lara ran off and got into her car when Riddle had left. She had heard Geraldson on the radio. Cain was at the school. As she pull up she saw the school imploding from the inside. Students and adults were running away. Running for their lives. Lara parked in the parking lot. The entrance exploded. Cain walked out of the entrance his surroundings were lighting on fire as he passed. Some cops were trying to get in range to take the shot. No.. she couldn‚Äôt lose her baby again. Lara got out of her car.¬†

‚ÄúNo stop! Don‚Äôt shoot please! Cain stop this!‚Äù¬†

Lara ran toward Cain. She promised Cain she would never let anything happen to him again. She couldn‚Äôt sit back and watch him go again.¬†

An officer hiding behind his car held up his pistol and shot. Lara jumped front of Cain with her arms out. She was hit in the chest. Lara took a deep breath in and wheezed. Cain snapped out of his rage and caught his mother before she fell. He looked up and put a force field around him and Lara.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†

Lara smiled and touched his face. ‚ÄúCain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no not you too. Why?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain‚Ä¶‚Äù she forced out a laugh and a little blood trickled out of her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI always wanted to be good mom‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be disappointed in me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI could never be disappointed in you baby. I‚Äôm disappointed in the world and what they‚Äôve put us through.‚Äù She glanced out of the forcefield to see cops shooting at them with no effect.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too mom. Please don‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù Cain was crying watching his mom take her last breath. She began to struggle and Cain held her tighter. Then she was still. Cain laid her down staring at her. He slowly turned to the cop cars raised his hands up and blew every squad car up in front of him. Then he started blowing up the cars behind them.¬†

Geraldson could see the town being destroyed before his very eyes. Explosion after explosion. Bodies flying past him. Everything behind him was on fire. Geraldson broke his promise to always protect Cain and ran the opposite direction as far as he could.¬†

Liam was running but the explosions and fires were catching up fast. Everything was going to be destroyed until the army came in and took Cain out. Liam stopped. Living in a world where Cain died didn‚Äôt feel worth it. Liam ran toward the destruction. Floating ten feet off the ground, he saw his brother blowing up buildings and cars.¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain you have to stop. You‚Äôve taken out the cult. You are hurting innocent people now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took mom. They took mom Liam.‚Äù¬†

Liam looked down at the ground and tears fell.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of them Liam.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEven me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúDenny?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not Denny either.‚Äù

‚ÄúCain these houses, they belong to people like us. People like Denny. People like Charlotte or Carlie. You have to stop and go. If you don‚Äôt the military is going to take you out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to be around anymore Liam.‚Äù Liam could feel the fire closing in around him.¬†

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do it for yourself. Do it for me. We are all we have Liam. I can‚Äôt go on without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done too much Liam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre still my brother.‚Äù Liam smiled at Cain. Cain‚Äôs eyes became glassy. Cain floated to Liam, picked him up and flew out of Addersfield. Liam looked at the town glowing below. Cain waited till they were far enough away and put Liam on the ground. The both looked at each other.¬†

‚ÄúHow far do I have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúFar Cain. Far enough to where you are off the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill we ever see each other again?‚Äù¬†

Liam swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWe will find a way, Cain. That‚Äôs what us Vortox‚Äôs do.‚Äù¬†

The boys could hear helicopters getting near. Liam nodded to Cain and Cain shook his head. Cain started to walk away, paused, and looked back. ‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù¬†

They hugged for a brief second. Cain‚Äôs eyes began to glass up again. He let go of Liam, took off running and flew in the sky at a speed that was barely visible.

1lnluq1,https://i.redd.it/4nz0vgh9tw9f1.jpeg,How the Right Lounge Chair Can Transform a Living Room,"Creating a living space that feels just right isn‚Äôt always about big renovations or trendy updates. Sometimes, it comes down to one piece ‚Äî like a lounge chair ‚Äî that brings comfort, personality, and balance into the room. Lounge chairs may seem secondary next to sofas or sectionals, but they often end up being the spot everyone gravitates toward. When thoughtfully chosen, the right chair can shift the entire mood of a room.

Mid-century modern style remains a go-to for many homeowners, thanks to its timeless lines and clean design. It pairs well with a wide range of interiors ‚Äî whether your space leans cozy and traditional or sleek and minimalist. That‚Äôs part of what makes pieces like the[ Brookfield Swivel Glider Recliner Chair in Ivory Leather](https://midinmod.com/products/brookfield-swivel-glider-recliner-chair-ivory-leather) so appealing. It‚Äôs elegant but unfussy, with buttery leather and a smart swivel and recline design that adapts to how you actually live. Want to relax with a book? Watch a show? Sip coffee by the window? It fits in, effortlessly.

One of the reasons lounge chairs make such an impact is their versatility. They can anchor a quiet corner, offer extra seating when friends are over, or give a sense of completion to a room‚Äôs layout. In smaller spaces, they‚Äôre especially valuable ‚Äî acting as a focal point without making the room feel crowded. And when it comes to blending color and texture, options like the[ Bandera Swivel Glider Recliner Chair in Midnight Blue Linen](https://midinmod.com/products/bandera-swivel-glider-recliner-chair-midnight-blue-linen) prove how a pop of color can add just the right kind of contrast. The deep blue softens the mood, while the linen fabric adds a warm, tactile finish.

Choosing the right fabric isn‚Äôt just about looks. Leather, for example, tells its own story over time. It gets softer, develops a unique patina, and is easy to care for. Linen feels casual and breathable ‚Äî perfect for a laid-back setting. Velvet, on the other hand, adds a bit of luxury and depth. And for homes with kids, pets, or high daily use, performance fabrics are a game changer. The[ Wimberley Swivel Glider Recliner Chair in Latte Linen](https://midinmod.com/products/wimberley-swivel-glider-recliner-chair-latte-linen) strikes that smart balance between comfort and durability, blending into the background while still making a subtle statement.

Sustainability is another growing factor in how people choose furniture today. Many shoppers are moving away from disposable design and instead looking for pieces that will last ‚Äî both in quality and in style. That‚Äôs part of the appeal of mid-century modern lounge chairs. They‚Äôre not just on trend; they‚Äôve stood the test of time. Investing in one well-made piece often proves more rewarding than replacing cheaper options again and again.

Lounge chairs also serve more than one function. Maybe it becomes the go-to work-from-home seat. Or the perfect corner for your evening tea. The ones that swivel and recline give you even more flexibility. They‚Äôre easy to move into conversation zones or shift toward natural light, turning an unused spot into one of the most loved parts of the house. In homes where spaces are used for multiple purposes ‚Äî work, rest, play ‚Äî adaptable furniture is more important than ever.

Comfort is the final, but arguably most important, piece of the puzzle. A lounge chair should invite you to slow down. It should support your body in a way that makes you want to linger a little longer ‚Äî maybe even doze off on a Sunday afternoon. That‚Äôs why models like the penny lounge chair have such a following. They look beautiful, yes, but they‚Äôre built for real-life lounging.

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs not just about finding a good-looking chair. It‚Äôs about finding one that fits into the way you live. A velvet lounge chair might bring the drama you want for a bold space, while a mid-century modern lounge chair keeps things clean and classic. What matters is that it feels right to you ‚Äî in style, in scale, and in comfort.

At[ Mid in Mod](https://midinmod.com), we believe furniture should work for you. That‚Äôs why our collection of lounge chairs combines timeless design with everyday practicality. Whether you‚Äôre refreshing one corner or rethinking your whole space, we‚Äôre here to help you find the piece that makes it all come together. Because when a chair feels like it was made for you, it changes how you feel in your home.

1lnlu1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1lnlu1v/im_free_i_quit_no_regrets/,I'm free. I quit. No regrets.,"I quit. 135 and as the saying goes I'm getting my üíÖ done. I just want to say that I have never in my life ever experienced what I have experienced in my life working 20+ years. 

To summize I was a Chef for many years. Had the opportunity to want to take a change of pace and just focus on coffee. Now I did in fact work for Starbucks at a licensed store in Target 20 years ago...time was simpler then. And bring us to present 2025. Three weeks...it took 3 weeks for me to keep my integrity in tact as an SSV. And yesterday I had enough.

It wasn't the expectations of Starbucks standards, not at all. It was well understood the 4/4/12 tempo WHEN all your players are working. Its another when the management is so toxic that it trickled down to ALL other SSV who were my peers. And how it made  other partners/baristas feel.

Well checkmate I went above the SM and DM and made it to corporate. The response was as expected. I think what leaves me satisfied is knowing I walked away with dignity and my integrity in tact and taking myself elsewhere. They say they are intolerant of any abhorrent and aggregious behavior as what happened to me is waaaaaaaaaay deeper than just the store. Still haven't been paid properly...yeah I'll leave that right there.

I refuse to illicit harm or willful neglect just to make a buck for a drink designed for a diabetic with a sugar addiction. The modifications ALLOWED for customers needs a limit. The toxic environment employed is ridiculous if people are feeling threatened about having a job to pay they bills. Nobody is paid enough. As for mental health? I was told by the SM I should explore what the company offers implying I'm mental multiple times. WOW.THE GASLIGHTING is impressive...and INSANE!

Then to have my narcissistic boss call me for feedback after I quit? Unbelievable. I told her your people told me I couldn't perform so why be here?Oh wait it changed day to day. I've never had a other person invoke the name of my DM at me like a threat as much as I had working at this location from another SSV training me. And right on brand my manager of course  she twisted everything I said gaslighting me...absolutely not.This place will take your soul. Well shocker half your staff wants to leave or they are stuck. A partner told me yesterday 30 people have floated through there and quit since November 2024 when she transfered. Awesome I am 31.

This isn't about coffee or connection. Its about corporate greed and money. And there is nothing that would be convince me otherwise how everyone in management is sipping on the siren koolaide.  If your ever in Vegas...welcome to the thunderdome of a district. The current DM was former Google and knows the HR handbook. It will NEVER be in your favor only the company. Either comply or die. 

I rather die.

here‚Äôs my experience for anyone who wants to visit mykonos but is unsure after reading everything negative online: we were supposed to go exploring Sicily this summer with friends whose family lives there but our plans got cancelled last minute, so i had to book everything 2 months in advance (which i hate doing. i always book all vacations for the year either at the end or beginning of the year. so as our plans fell through and i always like to travel on budget - i went looking for cheapest travel + accommodation & close to the sea. so after hours of researching i was excited to see our next vacation will be mykonos - i‚Äôve loved greece ever since i was little. we booked 7 days. which everyone seems to think is a hell lol. but we have loved every second of it!! i‚Äôll say the amount of days you spend here should be based on what your goal is. we came here to relax, enjoy the sea, tan and explore new place. and we got all of it and if we could we would be here for few more days to really relax and tan. while we enjoy eating out and trying good restaurants we tend to do that on birthdays, anniversaries, special occasions or if we have no special plans in a month. but on vacations we focus on relaxing or exploring. we tend to try one or two good restaurants (beginning / end of vacation) but other than that we always eat on a budget. and i felt no difference here. our hotel is right in front of a beach, next to our hotel we have a market in which we had a cesar salad for 7.50‚Ç¨, chicken sandwiches with yummy sauces for 5.50‚Ç¨ (so obsessed with these. i‚Äôll miss this the most lol) or ham/bacon sandwiches for 5‚Ç¨, we also buy 1.5l waters for 1‚Ç¨ here.

other than that we had pita gyros in city - Sakis - for 8‚Ç¨ (i was so full i couldn‚Äôt even finish it) and as we were exploring the island we stopped in Extreme Gyros i had pork gyros with side of fries for 8‚Ç¨ (i jusr checked their wolt and you can even get some wraps for less than 6‚Ç¨) and my boyfriend had casa de gyros pita covered in fries with cheese and bacon for 12‚Ç¨ regular not the xxl version(wish we knew how big this is beforehand. bc it‚Äôs not the xxl version we thought it won‚Äôt be that big but it was too much and we could have split it as he only ate half and the other half they packed for us and he had it for dinner)

we rented atv for one day and we did a bigger shopping in cheaper market, a little bit more far off from mainstream locations but still very close as the island is small.

the airport transfer was in the price of our booking. but there is bus stop right next to our hotel and it costs only 2‚Ç¨ to go to the city, port and airport. breakfast was also in the price of our booking so we have slow mornings with very full filing breakfast & amazing coffee and beautiful sea view. 

the souvenir prices are the same as in other similar locations we have been to.

our last day here we will go exploring some more expensive restaurants and some yummy sweets i saw online, but you can still find food for under 10‚Ç¨ which is more than good enough, especially if you won‚Äôt be staying for too long! 

so yes, the drinks? expensive as hell! most of the restaurants in the city? expensivr as hell!
but you can eat for cheaper. you can enjoy very chill beaches as most of the people come here to party and shop till they drop. the beaches have crystal clear water. the sunbeds are 20‚Ç¨ but we brought our own blanket and paid 0‚Ç¨ lol. 

it is all doable! the people are so so so nice. the island is beautiful and not overcrowded. it just depends what is your goal! and if you plan and research in advance you can have an amazing time here! ",15,1751221571.0,GreeceTravel,4,0.89,False

‚ÄúCome down to my office and we will explain everything‚Äù responded Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúFine all five of us‚Äù.

Newsome agreed. The five of them walked into Newsome‚Äôs isolated office. Liam stared at the ground,¬† looking very uncomfortable.¬†

Michael had felt sick to his stomach. He had allowed something traumatizing to happen to Cain once. These people he was with, if he had any suspicion they were part of the kidnapping, he was going to go hands on. They entered Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office and Mr. Newsome began talking.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Vortox, your son Liam was snooping around my classroom and started yelling profanities as a joke.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust why the hell would he do that? Where‚Äôs Cain?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe ran out the school doors, I think your son Liam riled him trying to play jokes.‚Äù

Barnliver chimed in ‚ÄúYes I think we will have to discipline them when we get Cain back. Probably after school detention for both of them.‚Äù¬†

Michael stared at both of them. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like something either of them would do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam‚Äôs actually had a history of horseplay last year and the year before‚Äù

Michael sighed and began to walk around the office. He knew his boys weren‚Äôt perfect but if words had a scent, this would be bullshit.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse to make them do after school detention. Would they get out of school detention?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want your children in school Mr. Vortox?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be honest, I don‚Äôt trust the three of you right now, I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†

Newsome grabbed a bag and started digging around. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt trust me, I will get all the logs that shows the progress Cain has been making.‚Äù¬†

Michael looked around his office and saw data logs on his computer. There were logs of ‚Äúdistances variable could fly‚Äù, ‚Äúfire variable‚Äù ,‚Äúobjects variable can move‚Äù. Michael was horrified. This wasn‚Äôt a classroom.¬†

Newsome‚Äôs eyes grew wide. He had been sloppy. How could he have left that up? He set the bag down and grabbed another. He began to maneuver around behind Michael and next to Liam.

Michael glared at Mr. Barnliver and growled ‚ÄúJust what the fuck operation are you-

Mr. Newsome shuffled through the bag and pulled out a pistol with a silencer on it and shot Michael in the back of the head. Michael‚Äôs entire body shook and straightened out momentarily. Blood sprayed the wall and Mr. Barnliver. Michael‚Äôs body fell to the ground. Liam screamed and swatted the gun out of Newsome‚Äôs hand. Liam and Newsome both dove on the ground wrestling for position to grab the pistol. Mr. Barnliver ran over and picked up the pistol. Newsome yelled ‚ÄúFinish him!‚Äù¬†

Barnliver pointed the gun at Liam as lay crying on the floor. His finger went to the trigger when something zoomed into the room and hit Barnliver with such force that they went through the wall. Liam heard footsteps from the opposite end of the room¬† and looked back. It was Geraldson. Geraldson stared at Michael‚Äôs body while a pool of blood began to flow underneath. Liam crawled out of the office. He couldn‚Äôt look at his dad‚Äôs body any longer.¬†

‚ÄúYou are all under arrest‚Äù commanded Officer Gerald. ‚ÄúLiam go outside.‚Äù Liam nodded and began to run out.¬†

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù a voice rang out from the hole in the wall. Mr. Barnliver‚Äôs severed head was tossed through a hole in Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLiam are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain stay in there!‚Äù¬†

Cain walked out. Glared at Newsome and Shultz who looked visibly frightened. Cain looked down at his dad‚Äôs body. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He grew red.¬†

‚ÄúShoot him, he's the dangerous one!‚Äù Shultz yelled out pointing at Cain.¬†

Cain grabbed her arm and snapped it into two. Ms. Shultz opened her mouth to scream but Cain grabbed a coffee mug sitting on the desk and shoved it down her throat. Muffled screaming came out of Ms. Shultz‚Äôs stuffed throat. Geraldson yelled for Cain but Cain waved his hand and set him flying back twenty feet.¬†

‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE!‚Äù yelled Cain in a deep voice unlike his own. Newsome began to run out of his office but Cain sent a force into his left knee making it unusable. Cain lifted both of them and threw them through the gymnasium doors. Geraldson ran and hit the fire alarm. This was going to get ugly if he didn‚Äôt get the other students out of the building. Cain levitated a foot off the ground and floated into the gymnasium. Officer Riddle ran around the corner and saw Cain floating and two other adults floating. ‚ÄúCain stop or I will have to shoot!‚Äù Cain waived his hand and tipped the bleachers on top of Officer Riddle. Cain screamed which shook the entire school. Officer Geraldson ran outside and directed the other officers to evacuate the other students. Cain ripped off Ms. Shultz‚Äôs limbs from her torso and threw the pieces to the side. It was just him and Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way Cain. We can get away from this.‚Äù¬†

Tears flew from Cain‚Äôs face as he roared ‚ÄúYou killed my father!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe world can be yours Cain.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt already is.‚Äù¬†

Cain lifted his hands and set Newsome on fire. Newsome screamed as he became a floating human torch. Cain screamed back as he made the fire hotter and hotter. Then Cain screamed and blew roof off of the gymnasium. Still levitating, Cain levitated down the halls of the school destructing the windows, walls and whatever stood in his way.¬†

Lara ran off and got into her car when Riddle had left. She had heard Geraldson on the radio. Cain was at the school. As she pull up she saw the school imploding from the inside. Students and adults were running away. Running for their lives. Lara parked in the parking lot. The entrance exploded. Cain walked out of the entrance his surroundings were lighting on fire as he passed. Some cops were trying to get in range to take the shot. No.. she couldn‚Äôt lose her baby again. Lara got out of her car.¬†

‚ÄúNo stop! Don‚Äôt shoot please! Cain stop this!‚Äù¬†

Lara ran toward Cain. She promised Cain she would never let anything happen to him again. She couldn‚Äôt sit back and watch him go again.¬†

An officer hiding behind his car held up his pistol and shot. Lara jumped front of Cain with her arms out. She was hit in the chest. Lara took a deep breath in and wheezed. Cain snapped out of his rage and caught his mother before she fell. He looked up and put a force field around him and Lara.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†

Lara smiled and touched his face. ‚ÄúCain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no not you too. Why?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain‚Ä¶‚Äù she forced out a laugh and a little blood trickled out of her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI always wanted to be good mom‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be disappointed in me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI could never be disappointed in you baby. I‚Äôm disappointed in the world and what they‚Äôve put us through.‚Äù She glanced out of the forcefield to see cops shooting at them with no effect.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too mom. Please don‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù Cain was crying watching his mom take her last breath. She began to struggle and Cain held her tighter. Then she was still. Cain laid her down staring at her. He slowly turned to the cop cars raised his hands up and blew every squad car up in front of him. Then he started blowing up the cars behind them.¬†

Geraldson could see the town being destroyed before his very eyes. Explosion after explosion. Bodies flying past him. Everything behind him was on fire. Geraldson broke his promise to always protect Cain and ran the opposite direction as far as he could.¬†

Liam was running but the explosions and fires were catching up fast. Everything was going to be destroyed until the army came in and took Cain out. Liam stopped. Living in a world where Cain died didn‚Äôt feel worth it. Liam ran toward the destruction. Floating ten feet off the ground, he saw his brother blowing up buildings and cars.¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain you have to stop. You‚Äôve taken out the cult. You are hurting innocent people now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took mom. They took mom Liam.‚Äù¬†

Liam looked down at the ground and tears fell.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of them Liam.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEven me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúDenny?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not Denny either.‚Äù

‚ÄúCain these houses, they belong to people like us. People like Denny. People like Charlotte or Carlie. You have to stop and go. If you don‚Äôt the military is going to take you out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to be around anymore Liam.‚Äù Liam could feel the fire closing in around him.¬†

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do it for yourself. Do it for me. We are all we have Liam. I can‚Äôt go on without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done too much Liam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre still my brother.‚Äù Liam smiled at Cain. Cain‚Äôs eyes became glassy. Cain floated to Liam, picked him up and flew out of Addersfield. Liam looked at the town glowing below. Cain waited till they were far enough away and put Liam on the ground. The both looked at each other.¬†

‚ÄúHow far do I have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúFar Cain. Far enough to where you are off the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill we ever see each other again?‚Äù¬†

Liam swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWe will find a way, Cain. That‚Äôs what us Vortox‚Äôs do.‚Äù¬†

The boys could hear helicopters getting near. Liam nodded to Cain and Cain shook his head. Cain started to walk away, paused, and looked back. ‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù¬†

They hugged for a brief second. Cain‚Äôs eyes began to glass up again. He let go of Liam, took off running and flew in the sky at a speed that was barely visible.

It started slowly, just feeling some jitters in my hand and feet. A few minutes later, it's turned into an almost existential dread where I feel the urge to try to ""fix"" everything that's been stressing me out this last week. 

It gives me the urge to reach out to people, who I probably shouldn't be talking to in this state, like my boss or other family members. So luckily, I'm aware enough not to do that. I'm distracting myself by talking to people who aren't my coworkers and not reading headlines that could make my anxiety peak. 

The last time I've experienced this was before I got laid off, so it's bringing up a lot of old thoughts and feelings. But luckily, I'm able to say to myself that those thoughts/feelings are valid and to let them pass. But holy shit this feels so awful. 

  
So I've been reaching out to safe people that I can talk to and looking up things that I used to hyperfocus on to keep me distracted. ",5,1751221457.0,ADHD,7,0.86,False

I think I have had silent reflux since December, just didn't know it. I was coughing after eating, lots of mucus. I was dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety.

I had a flare after a very stressful period, and I have had mass improvements.

This is what I did.

1. I was drinking a LOT of coffee. I started to wean myself off. I am down to 1/8th of a cup, and I will be at 0 cups in two days. This prevented the dreaded withdrawal.

2. I started taking pepcid 20mg twice a day. I switched halfway through to a PPI and did not go well. I went back to pepcid.

3. I eat bland. I love pineapple, I love spicy foods, I LOVE hot sauce. I could eat Mexican food every day. This has been the hardest. But, I eat cream of wheat, bananas, eggs whites, ground turkey, lots of chicken breast, rice pudding, graham crackers, swiss cheese, etc. 

Typical day: Breakfast: cream of wheat, 1/2 banana mushed. Egg whites with a little bit of pepper (CAUTION, pepper can trigger reflex for many, it does not me) Lunch: chicken breast with herbs (bought an italian herb mix with no pepper, garlic or onion) and green beans. I split this into two portions. Dinner: Soup. I do carrots, celery, chicken broth, chicken breast, egg noodles. 1 piece of sour dough toast. Dessert: 1/2 serving of rice pudding with 1 graham cracker. Snacks: rice crackers with swiss cheese, delimeat and cheese, cantaloupe, yogurt. I try to be dairy free, and have tried dairy free yogurt. This week, I am using greek yogurt to make a ""sauce"" for my meals.

4. I eat SMALL portions. I eat 5-6 meals per day. I split my lunch into two servings. I eat 2 snacks. 

5. I elevated my head only, not my body. I have severe back injury and body injuries and sleeping on a wedge was a nightmare. I elevate my head and my shoulders and sleep so much better. I sleep on my back.

6. I drink alkaline water after lunch/dinner, especially if I feel acid.

7. I drink bovine colostrum.

8. I walk after dinner. I walk after eating in general. Even at work.

9. I lost weight. I am already on a fitness journey, so this has continued. I have lost 6 lbs in 2.5 weeks, which is a lot for me.

10. I have reduced my stress. I do deep breathing, journaling, therapy and started hydroxyzine. 

I hope this helps someone. I feel hopeful that this can go away or get better for many of us.

It started with what at first I thought was an ulcer from poor diet and alcohol use about a year ago. It started as sharp pain in my stomach that would last around 2 hours and have me curled up in bed the whole time. Around lunch time almost on the dot every day. However a round of omeprazole seemed to recover me from this.

 Fast forward to New Years this year and after a night of greasy food and New Years celebrations a similar pain comes on. I end up going to the ER as I thought I was having a heart attack or something it was so painful. I had chest tightness and trouble breathing, sharp stomach pain, and my face, hands, and arms all locked up in a twisted position with my muscles hard as a rock. By the time my partner got me to the hospital I couldn‚Äôt even talk my jaw was locked shut. They did an ekg and chest XRay and put me on oxygen for a few hours until my muscles untensed. And basically told me to get some electrolytes. 

Since then I have had this discomforting bloating and indigestion feeling all day everyday. Exacerbated about an hour to 2 hours after any meal. This is accompanied with an intense pressure headache that once started usually persists throughout the whole day. Along with the headache and indigestion I get this mental fog that is hard to shake or keep focused on things. I have had an endoscopy and ultrasound showing nothing. And an allergy test showing a slight wheat allergy which I have cut out of my diet for months now. 

I eat a very healthy diet and go on runs 5
Days a week and have great blood pressure. I have not drank alcohol except for mabye 3 times this year to test triggers, same with coffee. I have found that fatty foods, sugar and especially coffee will trigger the stomach pains and headaches especially bad. As well I had 2 alcoholic seltzers the other night and had this very intense episode in my sleep where I woke up cold, sweating, confused where I was with this sense of dread and a massive headache. I‚Äôm frightened it was aura before or after a seizure but have never felt like that before in my life. 

Nothing seems to be improving what‚Äôs going on and my doctor is still at a loss for what it could be. Healthcare is scarce at best in the part of the state I live in and my doctor just left town for the next 6 months.
Hoping to get on a Telehealth call and hopefully get more tests done I‚Äôm going to ask about a HIDA scan. Wanted to know if anyone had symptoms similar
With gallbladder attacks and whether there ultrasound showed nothing while a HIDA revealed more issues? Is there any diet plans that can improve symptoms or any diet tests that can confirm gallbladder issues or what to avoid?

A friend who owed me a small amount of money told me that my kid deserves having a cancer when I asked to get my money back. 

I was fuming when I read the message and thought of forwarding our conversation to her employer but after serious consideration I didn‚Äôt. Yesterday, I posted our conversation on social media, tagged her and put it in my story too. Some of our mutual friends reached out telling me that they also owed them money. 

Earlier today, she messaged me calling me names and wishing my kid to die which was just disgusting. I blocked her after telling her that she is a hateful human being and that she can keep the money that she owed me to buy more coffee to post on social media. 

I‚Äôm still upset that my kid almost missed her doctor‚Äôs appointment because I didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay for it. Took several payday loans and I somehow made it work. The only thing that I hated was how I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy my kid an ice cream after enduring all the pain at her doctor‚Äôs appointment which makes me feel like a bad mom.

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse to make them do after school detention. Would they get out of school detention?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want your children in school Mr. Vortox?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be honest, I don‚Äôt trust the three of you right now, I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†

Newsome grabbed a bag and started digging around. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt trust me, I will get all the logs that shows the progress Cain has been making.‚Äù¬†

Michael looked around his office and saw data logs on his computer. There were logs of ‚Äúdistances variable could fly‚Äù, ‚Äúfire variable‚Äù ,‚Äúobjects variable can move‚Äù. Michael was horrified. This wasn‚Äôt a classroom.¬†

Newsome‚Äôs eyes grew wide. He had been sloppy. How could he have left that up? He set the bag down and grabbed another. He began to maneuver around behind Michael and next to Liam.

Michael glared at Mr. Barnliver and growled ‚ÄúJust what the fuck operation are you-

Mr. Newsome shuffled through the bag and pulled out a pistol with a silencer on it and shot Michael in the back of the head. Michael‚Äôs entire body shook and straightened out momentarily. Blood sprayed the wall and Mr. Barnliver. Michael‚Äôs body fell to the ground. Liam screamed and swatted the gun out of Newsome‚Äôs hand. Liam and Newsome both dove on the ground wrestling for position to grab the pistol. Mr. Barnliver ran over and picked up the pistol. Newsome yelled ‚ÄúFinish him!‚Äù¬†

Barnliver pointed the gun at Liam as lay crying on the floor. His finger went to the trigger when something zoomed into the room and hit Barnliver with such force that they went through the wall. Liam heard footsteps from the opposite end of the room¬† and looked back. It was Geraldson. Geraldson stared at Michael‚Äôs body while a pool of blood began to flow underneath. Liam crawled out of the office. He couldn‚Äôt look at his dad‚Äôs body any longer.¬†

‚ÄúYou are all under arrest‚Äù commanded Officer Gerald. ‚ÄúLiam go outside.‚Äù Liam nodded and began to run out.¬†

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù a voice rang out from the hole in the wall. Mr. Barnliver‚Äôs severed head was tossed through a hole in Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLiam are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain stay in there!‚Äù¬†

Cain walked out. Glared at Newsome and Shultz who looked visibly frightened. Cain looked down at his dad‚Äôs body. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He grew red.¬†

‚ÄúShoot him, he's the dangerous one!‚Äù Shultz yelled out pointing at Cain.¬†

Cain grabbed her arm and snapped it into two. Ms. Shultz opened her mouth to scream but Cain grabbed a coffee mug sitting on the desk and shoved it down her throat. Muffled screaming came out of Ms. Shultz‚Äôs stuffed throat. Geraldson yelled for Cain but Cain waved his hand and set him flying back twenty feet.¬†

‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE!‚Äù yelled Cain in a deep voice unlike his own. Newsome began to run out of his office but Cain sent a force into his left knee making it unusable. Cain lifted both of them and threw them through the gymnasium doors. Geraldson ran and hit the fire alarm. This was going to get ugly if he didn‚Äôt get the other students out of the building. Cain levitated a foot off the ground and floated into the gymnasium. Officer Riddle ran around the corner and saw Cain floating and two other adults floating. ‚ÄúCain stop or I will have to shoot!‚Äù Cain waived his hand and tipped the bleachers on top of Officer Riddle. Cain screamed which shook the entire school. Officer Geraldson ran outside and directed the other officers to evacuate the other students. Cain ripped off Ms. Shultz‚Äôs limbs from her torso and threw the pieces to the side. It was just him and Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way Cain. We can get away from this.‚Äù¬†

Tears flew from Cain‚Äôs face as he roared ‚ÄúYou killed my father!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe world can be yours Cain.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt already is.‚Äù¬†

Cain lifted his hands and set Newsome on fire. Newsome screamed as he became a floating human torch. Cain screamed back as he made the fire hotter and hotter. Then Cain screamed and blew roof off of the gymnasium. Still levitating, Cain levitated down the halls of the school destructing the windows, walls and whatever stood in his way.¬†

Lara ran off and got into her car when Riddle had left. She had heard Geraldson on the radio. Cain was at the school. As she pull up she saw the school imploding from the inside. Students and adults were running away. Running for their lives. Lara parked in the parking lot. The entrance exploded. Cain walked out of the entrance his surroundings were lighting on fire as he passed. Some cops were trying to get in range to take the shot. No.. she couldn‚Äôt lose her baby again. Lara got out of her car.¬†

‚ÄúNo stop! Don‚Äôt shoot please! Cain stop this!‚Äù¬†

Lara ran toward Cain. She promised Cain she would never let anything happen to him again. She couldn‚Äôt sit back and watch him go again.¬†

An officer hiding behind his car held up his pistol and shot. Lara jumped front of Cain with her arms out. She was hit in the chest. Lara took a deep breath in and wheezed. Cain snapped out of his rage and caught his mother before she fell. He looked up and put a force field around him and Lara.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†

Lara smiled and touched his face. ‚ÄúCain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no not you too. Why?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain‚Ä¶‚Äù she forced out a laugh and a little blood trickled out of her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI always wanted to be good mom‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be disappointed in me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI could never be disappointed in you baby. I‚Äôm disappointed in the world and what they‚Äôve put us through.‚Äù She glanced out of the forcefield to see cops shooting at them with no effect.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too mom. Please don‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù Cain was crying watching his mom take her last breath. She began to struggle and Cain held her tighter. Then she was still. Cain laid her down staring at her. He slowly turned to the cop cars raised his hands up and blew every squad car up in front of him. Then he started blowing up the cars behind them.¬†

Geraldson could see the town being destroyed before his very eyes. Explosion after explosion. Bodies flying past him. Everything behind him was on fire. Geraldson broke his promise to always protect Cain and ran the opposite direction as far as he could.¬†

Liam was running but the explosions and fires were catching up fast. Everything was going to be destroyed until the army came in and took Cain out. Liam stopped. Living in a world where Cain died didn‚Äôt feel worth it. Liam ran toward the destruction. Floating ten feet off the ground, he saw his brother blowing up buildings and cars.¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain you have to stop. You‚Äôve taken out the cult. You are hurting innocent people now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took mom. They took mom Liam.‚Äù¬†

Liam looked down at the ground and tears fell.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of them Liam.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEven me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúDenny?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not Denny either.‚Äù

‚ÄúCain these houses, they belong to people like us. People like Denny. People like Charlotte or Carlie. You have to stop and go. If you don‚Äôt the military is going to take you out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to be around anymore Liam.‚Äù Liam could feel the fire closing in around him.¬†

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do it for yourself. Do it for me. We are all we have Liam. I can‚Äôt go on without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done too much Liam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre still my brother.‚Äù Liam smiled at Cain. Cain‚Äôs eyes became glassy. Cain floated to Liam, picked him up and flew out of Addersfield. Liam looked at the town glowing below. Cain waited till they were far enough away and put Liam on the ground. The both looked at each other.¬†

‚ÄúHow far do I have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúFar Cain. Far enough to where you are off the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill we ever see each other again?‚Äù¬†

Liam swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWe will find a way, Cain. That‚Äôs what us Vortox‚Äôs do.‚Äù¬†

The boys could hear helicopters getting near. Liam nodded to Cain and Cain shook his head. Cain started to walk away, paused, and looked back. ‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù¬†

They hugged for a brief second. Cain‚Äôs eyes began to glass up again. He let go of Liam, took off running and flew in the sky at a speed that was barely visible.

1lnljfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lnljfh/does_the_hario_v60_dripassist_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the Hario V60 Drip-Assist Coffee Maker Truly Enhance Your Brew?,"If you're anything like me and can‚Äôt start the day without a good cup of coffee, the Hario PDA-02-T might catch your eye. This poured-over coffee maker has been a daily companion in my kitchen for a while, and I must say it delivers a distinct coffee experience. While it provides noteworthy features and practicality, there are some aspects worth considering to see if it‚Äôs the best match for your coffee routine. Let‚Äôs break it down.

**Thoughtful Design for Practical Brewing**  
The design of this coffee maker is one of its standout features. It‚Äôs incredibly compact, which is perfect for my cluttered countertop. Made from clear materials, it has a clean aesthetic that doesn‚Äôt feel out of place and even manages to look intriguing during use. Everything about the build feels well-crafted, and the matte finish gives it a modest yet sophisticated appearance. The reusable filter is a huge plus, both environmentally and economically, especially for someone like me who brews coffee daily. However, I noticed over time that the clear materials tend to show stains and mineral buildup from consistent water usage, so regular cleaning is a must.

**Manual Brewing Made Simple**  
As a manual pour-over coffee maker, this device caters to those who appreciate control over their brewing process. I love how the Drip-Assist feature allows you to pour water at an even flow, mimicking the precision of a gooseneck kettle. This means no splashes, no spills, and a consistently good brew. You can use the included instructions that guide you to pour 50-70ml of water into the center first and finish with the outer ring. It sounds fancy, but trust me, even my coffee-clumsy uncle nailed it during his try without messing up the counter.

**Key Benefits**  
- Reusable filter reduces waste and saves costs.
- Compact size fits into tight kitchen spaces.  
- The Drip-Assist ensures even water distribution for a balanced extraction.  

[Grab Hario PDA-02-T at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b08xbjnvqh/)

**Limitations to Ponder**  
That said, not everything here screams perfection. While the Drip-Assist feature is great, the required pouring technique might feel a little rigid if you enjoy improvising your coffee ritual. For those unfamiliar with manual pour-over systems, it might have a slight learning curve‚Äîthough nothing insurmountable. Additionally, the plastic components, while durable, don‚Äôt give the premium feel some other coffee lovers might want.

- Stains and mineral buildup can be evident over time.  
- Slight learning curve for beginners transitioning to manual brewing.  

**Who‚Äôs It For?**  
This pour-over coffee maker is best suited for individuals who have a bit of experience or patience when it comes to brewing. It‚Äôs not necessarily for those who need to rush out the door within minutes of starting their day. If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys precision, customizable coffee strength, and eco-friendly practices, this product fits well into that lifestyle. My sister swears by it for brewing single-origin coffees where flavor profiles are a priority. She did, however, point out that it‚Äôs not the fastest method when comparing it to an automatic drip machine.

**Competing Brands**  
While the Hario PDA-02-T holds its ground, there are alternatives worth mentioning. The Chemex pour-over system is one competitor that focuses on larger capacity brewing and sleek glass designs. However, Chemex requires paper filters, which can add ongoing costs. Another rival is the Kalita Wave, which also emphasizes even water flow but leans toward a more compact form factor and uses proprietary flat-bottom filters. Where the Hario shines is its unique Drip-Assist component, keeping the brewing process consistent and beginner-friendly without additional accessories. On the flip side, brands like Fellow offer electric kettles with built-in temperature controls that better complement the pour-over experience.

**Quality for Price**  
Given the craftsmanship and features like the reusable filter and even water flow, this coffee maker presents decent value for its price point. Compared to competitors with similar capabilities, the Hario PDA-02-T keeps things budget-friendly without significantly compromising on functionality or quality. For me, this makes it appealing because investing in it didn‚Äôt feel like a gamble. Even though its simplicity might not wow every coffee enthusiast, it‚Äôs reliable enough to win over a large number of daily users. If you‚Äôre on the fence, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a worthwhile buy for anyone curious about controlled coffee brewing without a steep investment.

‚ÄúCome down to my office and we will explain everything‚Äù responded Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúFine all five of us‚Äù.

Newsome agreed. The five of them walked into Newsome‚Äôs isolated office. Liam stared at the ground,¬† looking very uncomfortable.¬†

Michael had felt sick to his stomach. He had allowed something traumatizing to happen to Cain once. These people he was with, if he had any suspicion they were part of the kidnapping, he was going to go hands on. They entered Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office and Mr. Newsome began talking.¬†

1lnlgoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lnlgoe/stomach_pain_headaches_brain_fog_but_tests_are/,"Stomach pain, headaches, brain fog but tests are coming back with nothing","I‚Äôm a 29m 150lbs generally healthy eater and active person whose been going through some stomach and head issues for almost a year now, with it being constant for the last 6 months. 

It started with what at first I thought was an ulcer from poor diet and alcohol use about a year ago. It started as sharp pain in my stomach that would last around 2 hours and have me curled up in bed the whole time. Around lunch time almost on the dot every day. However a round of omeprazole seemed to recover me from this.

 Fast forward to New Years this year and after a night of greasy food and New Years celebrations a similar pain comes on. I end up going to the ER as I thought I was having a heart attack or something it was so painful. I had chest tightness and trouble breathing, sharp stomach pain, and my face, hands, and arms all locked up in a twisted position with my muscles hard as a rock. By the time my partner got me to the hospital I couldn‚Äôt even talk my jaw was locked shut. They did an ekg and chest XRay and put me on oxygen for a few hours until my muscles untensed. And basically told me to get some electrolytes. 

Since then I have had this discomforting bloating and indigestion feeling all day everyday. Exacerbated about an hour to 2 hours after any meal. This is accompanied with an intense pressure headache that once started usually persists throughout the whole day. Along with the headache and indigestion I get this mental fog that is hard to shake or keep focused on things. I have had an endoscopy and ultrasound showing nothing. And an allergy test showing a slight wheat allergy which I have cut out of my diet for months now. 

I eat a very healthy diet and go on runs 5
Days a week and have great blood pressure. I have not drank alcohol except for mabye 3 times this year to test triggers, same with coffee. I have found that fatty foods, sugar and especially coffee will trigger the stomach pains and headaches especially bad. As well I had 2 alcoholic seltzers the other night and had this very intense episode in my sleep where I woke up cold, sweating, confused where I was with this sense of dread and a massive headache. I‚Äôm frightened it was aura before or after a seizure but have never felt like that before in my life. 

Nothing seems to be improving what‚Äôs going on and my doctor is still at a loss for what it could be. Healthcare is scarce at best in the part of the state I live in and my doctor just left town for the next 6 months.
Hoping to get on a Telehealth call and hopefully get more tests done but really just appreciate any kind of input from any of y‚Äôall on what possibly could be going on or what I can do with my health or what tests to take. ",1,1751220840.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
