1geegpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1geegpj/narcissist_milenmeshed_son_is_there_anyway_to/,Narcissist MIL/Enmeshed Son. Is there anyway to work this out or is my only logical option to leave? ,"
So I just got married in July 2024 and my DH and I are already talking divorce. All of this fighting really took off right before we go married. That is when I really slowly started to notice how insanely jealous and enmeshed my MIL was with her son. Here is everything that has happened in order:

1. The prenup - MIL basically told my husband he needs to get a prenup if we get married b/c she had to get one with DH‚Äôs father and DH father just used her for her money and still fought her in a her divorce. DH did bring this up to me before we got engaged. I agreed to it since he only mentioned putting the house he owned in it which is the house my husband inherited from his deceased father and grew up in. What I didn‚Äôt expect was a month before the wedding he gave me a prenup trying to get me to waive my right to alimony!! Long story short his mother kept telling him the whole time you‚Äôll be screwed if she ends up getting child support and alimony and to fight me on this. We fought so much on this and almost called it off. Finally after coming to an agreement my lawyer just had to sign. My lawyer took a while to sign her portion and mail it back to us and DH kept panicking that she wouldn‚Äôt send it on time before the wedding like somehow it was my fault that he waited 30 days before we got married. Then MiL gets on phone with me and is like he‚Äôs worried because the longer it takes the less valid it is and I need to understand where he is coming from and pressure my lawyer blah blah. I told them it wasn‚Äôt my fault they waited so last minute to do the prenup and they still got mad at me for the mail not coming and for it taking so long. We almost did not get married over this.

2. I tried to include MIL with wedding dress try ons and the only comment she made about me was that I had a fat line down my back (even though I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 120lbs). My family was honestly pretty shocked by how rude it was especially since they all kept saying how beautiful I looked and that was the only thing she could say.

3. During the wedding planning she kept making a fit to my DH that we had to have a rehearsal dinner at our newly renovated beautiful home and invite all her out of town guests and friends including her great uncles ex wife Sheila that she would not stop obsessing about the whole wedding. ‚ÄúSheila needs to be accommodated this way, Sheila needs to be accommodated that way.‚Äù It was insane. She even made my husband pay for valet at our house for Sheila and get ‚Äúbetter centerpieces‚Äù because Sheila would not have been impressed. My assumption is that Sheila is rich and well off and somehow MIL thinks if she‚Äôs nice to Sheila she will give her money. It was so stressful. She even asked my husband for $300 so she could give Sheila‚Äôs 60 year old son who was getting married a wedding gift. That‚Äôs when my husband snapped at her and said this is too much and she left our home. PS she did not contribute a dime to our wedding not even offer to pay for the cake or part of anything.

4. MIL did nicely offer to host the bridesmaids and me over to get ready for the wedding at her house with food and coffee in the morning. She said I could drop my wedding dress at her house once it was ready at alterations. When I went to pick up my wedding dress she told me to just keep it at my house instead cause it would be too much to make room for. My husband had to call her and talk to her about this saying we had no room at our house with renovations and then she called me and gaslighted me saying I misunderstood and she was ‚Äújust trying to give me options.‚Äù When my bridesmaids showed up no bagels coffee food or anything.

5. Fourth of July two weeks before our wedding hubby and I agreed we would be doing nothing cause we were so exhausted from wedding planning and renovating. I‚Äôm in my PJs resting and next thing I know is my DH is telling me his mom is coming over in 30 to have her and a friend over for Fourth of July. I told him that‚Äôs not ok and he said I know but she didn‚Äôt listen and told him she was coming over anyways. I‚Äôm in shock and clearly not ready for a party (later I‚Äôll also find out I was pregnant at this time and exhausted). So she comes in and my DH shouts mom Liz is mad at you! I‚Äôm like wtf. She then says we‚Äôll my son told me it was ok. And they proceed to have a freakin party at my house. I tried to talk to her about it later and both MIL and DH still maintain the other was at fault so I still have no idea what happened.

6. Thirteen days after the wedding, I try to talk to my husband about his drinking and he blows up on me and kicks me out of the house. I took a video of it because it was so bad and scary and just thought no one would believe me. My MILs response? ‚ÄúWell he was just having a temper tantrum and you need to go home and talk it out with him.‚Äù I told him we need couples therapy and his mom keeps saying no you guys don‚Äôt you just need to talk it out so DH reiterates this. I‚Äôm staying in the guest room at this point and so he hands me divorce papers saying he didn‚Äôt have a choice because I wouldn‚Äôt stop being mad (pretty sure his mom was telling him to do this too). THEN we find out I‚Äôm pregnant and miraculously she shows up at the house uninvited and unannounced with flowers. She came into the bedroom while I was sleeping and woke me up so I had to come out there and talk to her. She kept saying how amazing she‚Äôs gonna be a grandma and we have to go to couples therapy now to work it out for the baby!!! Then MIL and my husband sat there and continued to say that the baby name needs to start with an A and pick them out. It was disgusting.

7. The last straw - after our wedding she finally gave us a wedding gift of $2500 (which was very nice even though my parents paid for $30k of the wedding but okkkkk). We hadn‚Äôt written our thank you cards cause I‚Äôve been so tired with pregnancy/not feeling good and my husband refuses to do it. So we finally decided to deposit the checks since it had been two months and we didn‚Äôt want to upset people by delaying anymore. Next thing I know my hubby gets a text from his mom saying ‚Äúurgent call now,‚Äù he calls thinking she hurt herself, and she starts drilling him about how $2500 is missing from her account and how dare he cash it without writing her a thank you card blah blah blah. He‚Äôs in shock. She doesn‚Äôt know I can hear and after ranting for 5mins about how horribly rude we are she finally states ‚ÄúI know honey it‚Äôs not your fault it‚Äôs HERS.‚Äù I now have my confirmation that she keeps telling my SO that I‚Äôm the problem the whole time and that she‚Äôs freaking nuts. I tell my husband how upset I am that he didn‚Äôt stand up for me and we get in a whole other fight about it.

I then tell him I‚Äôm cutting his mother off and done with her. He doesn‚Äôt see that big of a problem with her behavior, refuses to put up boundaries, accuses me of trying to make him ‚Äúcut off his mom,‚Äù and tells me how I‚Äôm being horrible to HER and making HER upset by not talking to her. 

I‚Äôm just done. I got an apartment and am ready to move out. I can‚Äôt even think straight and we‚Äôve only been married 3 months. 

My question to all of you is do you think it is even worth it to keep going to couples therapy and try to work on this or do you think I just need to cut these people out of my life as he‚Äôs totally married to mom?

Also other red flags: I‚Äôm driving around a 15 year old car and he offered to help his mom out with her new 2023 car, MIL is his power of attorney, if he dies everything goes to MIL, even when we have a kid he said it will just be MIL and kids on his trust not me, she‚Äôs asked him for help to retire, she‚Äôs asked him to help her redo her backyard after we just did ours, she comes over unannounced all the time, she freaks out if I talk about her or her sons bad behavior to anyone, when I told her I was going to alanon for her son (which she used to go to) the only thing she could say was don‚Äôt talk about me in Alanon cause I‚Äôll be embarrassed, MIl has to do therapy for our marital problems, she tells her son about her Vjayjay problems she is having,literally even told him your marital problems are causing me so much stress I had an outbreak, and many many more that freak me out.

1geed3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1geed3r/it_started_with_an_itch_then_it_became_something/,"It started with an itch, then it became something else.","It started with an itch, the kind you dismiss as a stray irritant or the side effect of a poorly washed shirt. Nothing serious, just a vague discomfort on my forearm that I could scratch away without a second thought. By the next day, though, that itch had spread, snaking its way up my arm in patches that seemed to appear and vanish like ghostly bruises. When I looked closer, I saw faint outlines, almost like impressions beneath my skin, lines that seemed too precise to be random.

As the hours passed, I became acutely aware of that crawling, tingling sensation, as if something was squirming right under the surface, trailing like whispered secrets I couldn‚Äôt ignore. I forced myself to laugh about it, though the unease was already beginning to curl in my stomach. My friends joked that it was probably a new allergy or the side effect of too much late-night junk food. But this wasn‚Äôt an allergy‚ÄîI knew that. It was something else entirely, something I couldn‚Äôt easily explain away.

By the end of the day, I found myself instinctively covering the patches with my sleeves, hoping no one would notice how much I was scratching. There was no rash, nothing visible that should have made the itching so unbearable, but the irritation was constant, almost hypnotic in its persistence. And then, as I stood in front of my bathroom mirror that evening, rolling up my sleeve to inspect the strange marks, I noticed something far worse.

The skin on my forearm seemed‚Ä¶ uneven. Beneath it, as I pressed gently with my fingers, I could feel tiny bumps, like grains of sand shifting beneath the surface. My mind instantly jumped to all the horror stories I‚Äôd ever heard about parasites, though I dismissed it as soon as the thought arrived. But I couldn‚Äôt deny the physical reality, couldn‚Äôt brush away the sensation that something was undeniably, horrifyingly wrong.

That night, as I lay in bed, trying not to scratch, I felt that subtle shifting again, like a ripple running through the skin of my arm. It was slight, barely more than a whisper against my senses, but it was there, undeniable. I lay motionless, eyes wide open, feeling the unwelcome activity beneath my skin, a silent protest against sleep.

In a fit of desperation, I‚Äôd slathered on every ointment I could find, hoping it might soothe whatever was festering beneath. But as I closed my eyes, willing myself to ignore the sensation, a single thought began to gnaw at the edges of my mind: *What if it‚Äôs not just in my arm? What if it‚Äôs spreading?*

The itch, I realized, wasn‚Äôt just an annoyance anymore. It was a warning‚Äîa signal that something within me had started, and I had no idea how to make it stop.

The itch had spread by morning. What began as a single patch on my forearm had now crept up to my shoulder and down to my wrist. Each area tingled with an unnerving sensation, like ants crawling just beneath the skin, tracing invisible pathways along my nerves. I spent breakfast awkwardly holding my coffee mug, trying not to let my family see how much I was scratching. I could still hear my sister‚Äôs voice from the night before, mocking me for ‚Äúimagining things‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing paranoid.‚Äù But this was beyond imagination. The bumps under my skin were real.

I tried my best to avoid mirrors that morning, but the bathroom one caught me off guard as I reached for my toothbrush. My reflection stared back with dark, hollow eyes, evidence of a sleepless night spent tossing and turning. The skin on my forearm had taken on a strange, dull tone, slightly bruised and sunken where the itch was strongest. I pressed down on the spot again, feeling the telltale grit of tiny lumps shifting beneath the surface. They felt more distinct today, as if they had grown overnight, settling into my skin with a sickening permanence.

During my lunch break, I finally gave in to the impulse to Google my symptoms. Each result was worse than the last‚Äînerve disorders, rare skin diseases, parasitic infections. My stomach churned with dread, but I couldn‚Äôt stop reading, hypnotized by the horrifying possibilities. In the back of my mind, I tried to rationalize it away. Maybe it was stress? My job had been piling on the pressure lately, and I‚Äôd barely had a decent night‚Äôs sleep in weeks. But even as I thought this, I knew it was a weak excuse. Nothing about stress explained the feeling of something moving, something *alive*, beneath my skin.

By afternoon, the sensation had evolved. It was no longer just an itch; it was an almost rhythmic pulse, as though whatever was under my skin was slowly waking up, becoming aware. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it was probing, seeking something within me. When I wasn‚Äôt scratching, I was pressing my fingers against the bumps, trying to understand what they were. But each time, they slipped and shifted away from my touch, evading me like shadows under the skin.

As the day dragged on, the anxiety began to bleed into every part of me. I found myself barely focusing at work, my mind consumed with the alien presence in my own body. Colleagues cast worried glances my way, but I ignored them, unwilling to explain. Who would believe me? That I felt things crawling under my skin? I barely believed it myself.

I left work early, ignoring the concerned expressions of my manager and the odd questions from friends. As soon as I got home, I headed straight to the bathroom, rolling up my sleeve with a trembling hand. The patches of uneven skin had spread even further, branching like the veins in a leaf. It was now unmistakably clear that they were following a pattern, some kind of system that only they understood.

Unable to resist, I took a needle and carefully pressed it to the skin of my forearm, hoping that a small puncture might release whatever was trapped inside. The prick stung, and a bead of blood welled up, but nothing more. Frustrated, I pressed harder, trying to dig deeper, feeling the pressure build as I forced the needle further. But instead of relief, I felt a sharp, searing pain rip through my arm, and the skin buckled under my touch, pulsing in angry protest. I pulled the needle away, horrified, realizing I was only making it worse.

I sank onto the bathroom floor, clutching my arm, my mind racing. Whatever was beneath my skin, it didn‚Äôt want to be disturbed.

I couldn‚Äôt go to work the next day. The moment I tried to put on a shirt, the rough fabric brushed against my arm, igniting the sensation into a maddening fury. Every nerve seemed on edge, every inch of skin prickling with the unnatural movement underneath. It was as if my own body was rebelling, each patch of skin tightening over the hidden lumps as they shifted and pulsed.

I spent the morning in bed, sleeves rolled up, staring in morbid fascination as the trails of tiny lumps spread across my arm, weaving along my veins. The sight was dizzying. The tiny, gritty bumps beneath my skin were following a path, creating a map only they understood. I felt helpless, staring at my own body as it transformed into something unrecognizable. I was no longer just ‚Äúme‚Äù‚ÄîI was becoming their host, my skin their shelter, my body their prison.

Around noon, I heard my phone buzz on the bedside table. It was a message from my sister, checking in after our conversation the previous night. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to answer. How could I explain that what I‚Äôd tried to brush off as a skin irritation had become a full-blown infestation? I couldn‚Äôt even say the words to myself. Instead, I turned off the phone, cutting myself off from anyone who might try to reach out. This was mine to face, alone.

The hours dragged on, and the daylight began to dim outside. I lay still, paralyzed by fear and a morbid fascination, unable to tear my gaze from the gradual spread of the patches across my skin. I was half-caught in a trance, a waking nightmare that felt both surreal and inescapable. With every pulse, the bumps moved, shifting in sync with the beat of my own heart. They seemed to understand me in a way that was unnerving, as though each beat was their cue, each pause their signal.

The itching had dulled, replaced by something else‚Äîa raw, aching feeling as though my skin was being stretched from the inside. I ran my fingers along my arm, feeling the uneven texture beneath my touch, the lines and patches that had become almost a network. With a grim determination, I resolved to find out what they were, to confront whatever I had allowed to take root inside me.

Grabbing a small utility knife from my bedside drawer, I took a deep breath. My hand trembled, but I steadied it, pressing the blade just above one of the larger bumps on my forearm. A quick, shallow slice. Blood welled immediately, a thin line of red, but beyond the pain, I felt nothing else‚Äîno release, no dislodging of whatever was beneath. I wiped the blood away with a tissue, squinting as I tried to catch a glimpse of anything unusual within the shallow cut.

And then, as if in response, the bump under the skin moved. Slowly, it shifted just out of reach, retreating deeper, avoiding the light and the blade, evading me. My stomach turned, a nauseating wave washing over me. It was alive. A living thing, crawling just beneath my skin, aware of my attempts to remove it.

I stumbled back, clutching my arm, horror clawing up my throat as I realized the full extent of what was happening. Whatever was inside me, it wasn‚Äôt some random irritation, some easily excised intruder. It was something intelligent, something that knew how to evade, how to survive. I looked down, breathing shallow, watching the faint pulse beneath the surface, the outline of its path, winding its way along my arm and toward my shoulder.

The creeping sensation resumed, stronger now, winding through my skin like roots sinking into soil, spreading with a mind of its own.

I barely slept that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt the thing inside me moving, pulsing in time with my heart, twisting beneath the skin as though it was carving out its territory, claiming its host. My dreams were fevered flashes, glimpses of crawling shadows, of roots and tendrils winding their way through dark soil. And each time I jolted awake, that crawling, pressing sensation was there, more pronounced, as if the thing had grown while I slept, as if it had waited for my moments of weakness to sink deeper.

By morning, the transformation was undeniable. My skin had taken on a translucent pallor, faint veins crisscrossing in unnatural patterns. The bumps had spread down my forearm and up my shoulder, each one connected in a network of winding lines, an intricate web that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. I could no longer pretend this was something that could be explained or ignored. Whatever this was, it was taking me over, using my own body as a canvas to display its growth.

Desperation drove me to reach out, to find someone, anyone, who might know what was happening. I thumbed through my contacts until I found an old professor from university, Dr. Talbot, who had once taught a course on rare skin conditions and parasites. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in years, but the memory of his meticulous knowledge, his almost obsessive fascination with the peculiarities of human biology, pushed me to call. My voice was ragged, edged with panic as I explained my symptoms.

When I finished, there was a long pause, then a low, measured reply. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶sounds unlike anything I‚Äôve encountered, but it resembles certain parasitic infections. A rare few are known to mimic the patterns of the host‚Äôs nervous or circulatory system. If it‚Äôs following a path, it might be attempting to synchronize with you‚Äîperhaps even taking on your body‚Äôs blueprint.‚Äù

His words only intensified my dread. Synchronizing? Taking on my body‚Äôs blueprint? My grip tightened on the phone as I fought back the urge to scream. ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶how do I stop it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say,‚Äù he replied, his tone eerily calm. ‚ÄúBut I know one thing: most organisms that invade a host need something from them. Nutrients, control, even full integration. If this thing is synchronizing with you, it may be trying to merge in a way that cannot be undone. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove it.‚Äù

After hanging up, I found myself staring blankly at my arm, which felt less and less like it belonged to me. His words echoed in my mind‚Äî*integration, merge, host.* The implications rattled me to my core, an awareness that I was losing control not just of my arm, but of my very identity. I was becoming something else.

I grabbed my keys and stumbled out of my apartment, searching for answers or help or anything that might stop this. The sunlight felt harsh on my skin, each step sending waves of heat through my body, an unwelcome reminder that whatever was inside me seemed to thrive on my discomfort, feeding off the fear and pain that coiled inside. I headed to the nearest clinic, hoping a doctor might offer some concrete, medical explanation, something rational and fixable.

In the sterile brightness of the examination room, I showed the physician my arm, rolling up my sleeve with a resigned dread. Her face paled, eyes widening as she took in the web of bumps and lines, the undeniable network of trails tracing across my skin. She tried to hide her reaction, but I saw the flash of unease as she hesitated, as though unsure where to even begin.

‚ÄúWe might need to run some tests,‚Äù she murmured, but her voice sounded distant, as if I were underwater, hearing her through layers of fog. I watched as she examined my skin with gloved hands, her expression carefully blank. She pressed lightly along the bumps, and I felt that sickening shift beneath my skin, the creature‚Äîor creatures‚Äîmoving away from her touch as though defiant, aware of the intrusion.

‚ÄúAre you experiencing any‚Ä¶mental effects?‚Äù she asked, her words unnervingly cautious.

I hesitated, considering what to say. How could I explain the whispers that lingered in my mind, the strange, unsettling connection I was beginning to feel with the thing beneath my skin? It was no longer just a parasite or a disease. I could feel it now, pressing not only against my nerves but against my very thoughts, settling into the edges of my consciousness. I realized, with a shiver of horror, that it wasn‚Äôt just feeding on my body; it was feeding on my mind, integrating itself in ways I hadn‚Äôt thought possible.

I met the doctor‚Äôs gaze, but before I could answer, the creature moved again, this time with a distinct purpose, stretching along my arm and creeping toward my chest. The sensation was stronger, more insistent, as if it knew I was seeking help, as if it were tightening its hold. I gasped, the air seizing in my lungs as the realization crashed over me: it didn‚Äôt want to leave. It was fighting back, cementing its hold, rooting itself deeper.

In a final, desperate surge, I tried to push the creature back, pressing hard against my skin, willing it to recede, to give me some control. But the effort only seemed to strengthen it, each pulse intensifying, until the creature‚Äôs movements settled into a steady, relentless rhythm‚Äîmatching the beat of my own heart, synchronizing.

I stumbled out of the clinic, numb and exhausted, feeling my body slipping from my grasp, one inch at a time. The world blurred around me, sounds fading into a thick, buzzing murmur. Somewhere behind me, the doctor‚Äôs voice drifted out, muffled and distant, like it was sinking beneath water: *‚ÄúWait, we need to‚Ä¶ it could be dangerous‚Ä¶‚Äù* But her words dissolved into the haze, swallowed by the relentless, pulsing rhythm crawling through my veins, drowning out everything else.

As I walked home, I could sense it fully now, its presence growing stronger, not just in my arm, but in my mind. It was learning me, molding me, transforming me from the inside out.

By the time I reached my door, I knew, deep down, that I was no longer alone in my own skin. Whatever it was, it was there to stay.

That night, as I lay in bed, the final thread of hope unraveled. The creature had embedded itself so deeply that my body no longer felt like mine. Every movement, every heartbeat, every breath felt heavy and foreign, as if I were merely a shell that it inhabited. The skin on my arm and shoulder was now discolored and swollen, an angry, bruised landscape where the thing had claimed its domain. It looked sickly, bloated and taut, veins stretched to their limit and crisscrossing in unnatural directions.

The itching sensation had vanished entirely, replaced by a thick, pulsing ache. My skin felt too tight, like something was building pressure beneath the surface, straining to break free. I couldn‚Äôt resist anymore. I needed to see the full extent of its invasion. Moving slowly, I peeled my shirt away, exposing my shoulder and upper chest, where the network of bumps and lines had spread. The creature‚Äôs presence pulsed in time with my heart, a foreign rhythm that matched my own, yet somehow felt independent, like an echo that shouldn‚Äôt exist.

With trembling hands, I touched the swollen patch on my chest, feeling the unnatural warmth radiate from beneath. The skin was stretched to a grotesque degree, almost translucent, as if it were thinning out, dissolving into something weaker, more penetrable. I leaned in closer to the mirror, watching the faint, rippling movements under the surface. And then, to my horror, I saw it‚Äîa slick, sickly glint of something dark and oily, shifting just beneath the skin, oozing and coiling like thick, viscous sludge.

Unable to stop myself, I dug my nails into the taut skin, pulling until it broke. The pain was sharp and immediate, but my horror and curiosity overpowered the agony. I tore at the opening, and as the skin gave way, something thick and mucous-like began to seep out. It was dark, almost black, with a sickly green hue under the bathroom light, and it carried a smell so foul it felt like a punch to the senses‚Äîa mix of rotting meat and decay, something ancient and foul that had no business being inside a living human.

The substance pooled on the surface of my skin, thick and syrupy, like tar. It clung to my fingers, trailing in viscous strings as I tried to wipe it away, only for more to seep out, spilling from the wound like an infection brought to life. I stumbled back, gasping, as the creature within me seemed to react, shifting and writhing with a newfound aggression, as though angered by my attempt to purge it.

Then, from the open wound, something far worse emerged. Tiny, translucent tendrils began to poke through, curling outward like roots seeking soil. Each tendril was thin and wormlike, with a sickening wet sheen that glistened under the light. They wriggled, twisting and curling, exploring the air as if tasting their surroundings, seeking something beyond the confines of my body.

In a fit of panic, I slapped my hand over the wound, pressing hard to stop the flow, to force those writhing things back inside. But they continued to push against my hand, stretching and straining, their thin, squirming lengths winding between my fingers, slithering over my knuckles, searching. I could feel them coiling around my hand, cold and damp, with a texture that felt somewhere between slime and rot. My vision blurred with horror, but I couldn‚Äôt stop looking, couldn‚Äôt tear myself away from the monstrous sight unfolding on my own body.

With a growing sense of dread, I noticed something new‚Äîsmall, tooth-like structures forming at the ends of each tendril. Tiny, needle-thin spines, sharp and white, poked out from the ends, flexing as though testing their strength. And then, before I could pull my hand away, one of the tendrils latched onto my skin, its spines sinking in with a sickening prick. I gasped, feeling the sting as it burrowed into my flesh, anchoring itself to me. It began to pulse, pulling itself deeper, its body stretching and elongating as it forced its way under my skin.

I could feel each movement, each invasive push as it dug deeper, the sensation raw and visceral, a throbbing agony that burned through me. More tendrils followed, each one latching on, digging in with their needle-like teeth, burrowing beneath my hand, winding up my arm, creating a lattice of pain that seemed to spread in all directions. I tried to pull them off, but they were rooted firmly, part of me now, merging with my skin, my muscles, fusing in a grotesque symbiosis.

The creature was no longer content to hide beneath the surface. It was emerging, claiming me from the inside out, leaving no part of me untouched. I could feel it seeping through every cell, binding to my bones, spreading through my veins like a dark, invasive rot. And with each tendril that burrowed deeper, I could feel a change in my mind as well‚Äîa dull, creeping sense of surrender, as though the thing inside me was whispering, coaxing, merging its thoughts with mine.

I could no longer remember what it felt like to be just *me*.",1,1730152531.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1gee7m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/1gee7m4/from_zero_to_90_points/,From Zero to 90 Points,"I failed the OSCP exam. I passed the OSCP exam. This is my tale.

# My Background

I've worked in SRE for many years at a big company, but management left me rusty. I have a strong Linux, networking, and system design background, and I can code a little. I was clueless about Windows initially.

# Training Plan and Timeline

* **2023 April**: I started playing around on HTB and got more and more interested in security.
* **2023 October**: Decided OSCP was a good goal. Initially planned for two months of study, starting with HTB Academy's Penetration Tester curriculum.
* **2023 December**: I realized my two-month plan was pure fantasy.
* **2024 January‚ÄìMarch**: Completed PEN-200 course, 100% of the labs, and continued with HTB Academy and TJNull's list until I felt ready.

# First Attempt: Zero Points?!

My exam was scheduled at the end of April, 2024. Despite an encouraging start full of attack surfaces and leaked credentials, I got nowhere. I worked for 18 of the 24 hours, but I couldn‚Äôt secure a foothold. It all felt much harder than the PEN-200 labs. A crushing defeat.

# Stages of Grief, New Plan

I received the rejection email on May 3, 2024. Three weeks of self-pity and frustration led me to double down on fundamentals, slower enumeration, and more thorough note-taking. I shifted from hating all things Windows to appreciating the security challenges inherent in Windows and Active Directory.

* **2024 June‚ÄìJuly**: Focused on Windows/AD with HTB Academy and HTB CTFs.
* **2024 August‚ÄìSeptember**: Completed  about 70 HTB/PG targets with meticulous notes, integrating TJNull‚Äôs and Lainkusanagi‚Äôs OSCP lists for practice.

# Second Attempt: 90 Points

October 15, 2024, was retake day.

* **07:00**: Started. Within minutes I exploited a web service for an ""admin"" login on the AD set. Then I spun for a while in a SQLi rabbit hole.
* **08:55**: Got RCE. Got PE six minutes later.
* **11:28**: Domain Admin on AD set.
* **11:38‚Äì13:52**: Owned two of the three standalone machines.

That was already 90 points in about seven hours (hooray!) but I couldn‚Äôt own the final target, despite identifying several potential paths.

The final target was very similar to the most frustrating target from my first exam. I found all the same potential attack points as my first time around, but I uncovered another couple of interesting things (including credentials!) and so I figured it was only a matter of time and persistence.

For the next six hours, from about 2 PM until 8 PM, I tried breaking that final target, but I was stuck. After 8 PM I worked on a draft of the report, resetting targets and working through all of the exploits to make sure I had screenshots and that my descriptions of the exploits were correct. I finished a solid rough draft around 11:45 PM and went to sleep.

I woke up, showered, drank coffee, and took one last run at the final standalone with about 90 minutes remaining. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it, not even so much as a foothold.

I ate breakfast and began my final draft of the report, which took me about three hours to finish. 50 pages! In the process of writing it, I realized an obvious attack vector I had missed, a simple thing sitting right there in a big field of rabbit holes. I had dismissed it early on because it felt like a waste of time, and yet I proceeded to burn eight solid hours on everything else but that.

# Key Lessons

* **Don't Fool Yourself**: I was over-relying on hints during PEN-200 labs, rationalizing that I ""would have figured it out"" to such an extent that I wasn't even consciously realizing it. Explicitly categorizing practice targets into *No Hints Needed*, *Learned Something*, or *Try Harder* helped me correct this cognitive error.
* **Prioritize Weaknesses**: Focusing on Windows improved my performance significantly. The shift was evident when I started accidentally typing PowerShell commands on Linux boxes!
* **Recognize Rabbit Holes**: This comes through repetition, but you'll need to realize when you've tried everything you know and consider whether the current approach is distracting you from a better one.

# My OSCP Study Tracker

I modified the legendary TJNull and Lainkusanagi lists into an [OSCP Study Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nzEN0G6GzneWCfs6qte6Qqv-i8cV_j6po-tFlZAOx1k/edit?usp=sharing) for easy sorting and filtering. It tracks *No Hints Needed*, *Learned Something*, and *Try Harder* results. I also added a `Released` date-field for each machine, because it was useful to know if I was attacking a machine that was six years old or a more recent one. That also allows you to use Google dorks like `before:2024-08-31` to avoid spoilers. I took liberties by removing some items from those lists, e.g. I only included HTB and PG Practice platforms.

# TL;DR

Don't fool yourself about your reliance on hints. Make your weakest areas your strengths. Learn what rabbit holes feel like. Writing up your report with time left on the clock may reveal hidden answers. Good luck!",4,1730152149.0,oscp,1,1.0,False

Here are some thoughts on the places I tried in the 3-4 days staying here... 

Oxalis - I had high expectations for this restaurant, and I don't think they were warranted tbh? The food was fine, but nothing too special... I am a bit surprised that this is considered one of the best. The pasta dish in particular was just too salty and rich.

Bar Kismet - had to try b/c of obvious inclusion on many lists. I actually didn't get a lot of food here, so probably not qualified to make a full assessment. I got a seafood dish (forget which fish) with lobster bisque and brassicas. I enjoyed it, though it was not mindblowng. The tarte tatin with gouda was absolutely  delicious though.. The vibe of this place is extremely nice. I would say i enjoyed it quite a bit more than Oxalis, though i would have to try more food to be able to tell if it's mindblowingly good or not?

Dilly Dally cafe  - I loved this place. The decor is cute, it's clear they make everything fresh. The oatmeal they are making now is honestly some of the best I've tried.

Bliss coffee bar - good flat white, the food was honestly just average though? I went twice and tried different things.

Bar Sofia - I know this is part of a restaurant group that apparently doesn't treat their employees well? I have to say i actually really enjoyed eating here though... The food was filling   with very good flavors , but at the same time light and didn't weigh me down. The cocktail (can't remember what it was, something with guava) and their dessert (arroz con leche) were absolutely delicious. I know it's probably weird to enjoy a ""corporate"" place more than a local one, but the food was very good.

Ostrich Club -  i thought the food was kind of meh here. The sardines were ridiculously salty. The rest of the food was honestly just okay. Friendly service and cute vibes, but i regret spending quite a bit of $$ here.

The Ramblers coffee was fantastic, and actually it seems like there are quite a few coffee places here that make above average/ good coffee (East Cup Cafe , Steve-o-reno's , ). The coffee scene seems quite a bit better than Ottawa.

We've done 4 treatments to no avail, the roommate seems not to care about the roaches and mops the floors and cleans the surfaces less that 24 hours after the treatment, and leaves out a brown paper bag of compost 24/7 (essentially a buffet for roaches). 
It doesn't help that the appartment itself is ancient and there are spots where roaches can sneak back in though the walls and floors because I didn't have roaches up until AFTER they did a mandatory treatment of all appartments because one neighbor let it propagate too much, and they came to my place after. 

So I packed my bags and found a renovated and immaculately clean appartment and the first thing I did was put all my cookware and kitchen gadgets (air fryer, coffee machine, fan, and even my computer screen -where I can visibly see roach Antenna sticking out from the bottom vent- outside where the temperature is -3 at night and 5 in the day this week, and so far I see a bunch of dead reaches on the ground.  

What else can I do? My mom says make a mixture of alcohol and eucalyptus oil and spray everything down to irritate and kill the roaches. 

Tips please! 

PS. I've found a few live juvenile roaches in my appartment as a result of contamination from my old appartment. I'm NOT worried about a new infestation because I don't even have food at my place yet, and I've found some dead ones laying around as well. I kill whatever I see is alive.

Well some girl was on headset run and she got up to pending so she asked someone else to take her cars whilst she focuses on that. The girl on present didn‚Äôt know it nor did the person on bev cell so I was the only one on front counter who knows it.

I'm an electronics engineer and coffee enthusiast working on a DIY project to improve coffee quality analysis. I‚Äôm developing a device that goes beyond typical TDS meters to collect additional data about the coffee‚Äôs composition.

**Project Overview:**  
The device will include a visible-spectrum spectrometer to gather more detailed data on the coffee‚Äôs chemical composition. I‚Äôm also planning to integrate modules like a refractometer and an ultrasonic analyzer for a broader range of insights. Since this is a personal, non-commercial project, I‚Äôm working with a budget of about 100 euros (outside of my time), and I expect the project to take around 5 months.

**My Goal:**  
To build a practical open-source tool that coffee enthusiasts and researchers could easily assemble, calibrate, and use to gain insights beyond TDS measurements.

**Questions for Chemists:**

Hi,

I'm pretty new to miniature painting, and honestly I still have no idea what I'm doing. I have no background in arts or design, nor did I show any talent ever...

I got the Army Painter Starter set as a gift, which I admittedly did enjoy quite a lot. I did my best to follow the video tutorials

https://preview.redd.it/qcylqkco9kxd1.jpg?width=1545&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15128d6ea824d87ade1c1ef37b007904fe8d0b94

Being hooked, but feeling overwhelmed by all the Youtube contents I got myself the book ""The Art of‚Ä¶ Tommie Soule Volume 5"" plus the Warhammer introductory set to get some models/paints allowing me to follow the book.

  
In the first part of the book we learn on about consistency, the pull stroke, recess shading, and adding highlights. All that basically using the same consistency, and yes I did use the pull stroke only:

https://preview.redd.it/grhfrvwpakxd1.jpg?width=1975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4072006a204755b9d28507055f1aca63e6043ab

Next we learn about basing (+ dry brushing - you are encourage to check out Artis Opus dry brushing tutorials), playing with consistency (this time I used more transparent consistency for shading + highlights), and the side stroke. This time I wanted to paint a Tyranid. Unfortunately I primed all minis in black and the wraithbone color was clumbing really badly. In the hobby shop I got some steel mixing balls ... and a basing kit they have had on discount. I decided apply a dark and then a light pink base coat on the body and finally dry brush the body using wraithbone (also because with my basing kit I couldn't test dry brushing the base). 

https://preview.redd.it/29wqy7orckxd1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6f50f62afb362523d9774e4487175e6a9b60fa1

The front of the gun was painted with thin layers of pink and red.

  
Finally we learn about the push stroke, glazing, and the puddle. Unfortunately I have no idea where/when to apply those exactly, but as the book uses a space marine as an example I tried to add some ""light"" and shadows using those techniques (I took some photos from under a desk lamp to help me a little). I have had to restart as I got quite bad coffee stains on my first try. Still looks chalky here and there, and some edge highlights turned out lighter than I wanted them to be, but I'm still happy with the result (this time I kinda followed the basing instructions from the book)

https://preview.redd.it/onzy2jgbekxd1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fcbef5bebb2fe35ab0ce8e01bc0217d5c72c8ae

All in all I found the book super helpful, although it concentrates mostly on technique. I'm sure I will  re-read it in a few months again (I mean, I did read it like 3 times by now) as I most probably missed half of the contents.

  
Just received a copy of Figopedia, which hopefully will help me learn more about light placement.",5,1730151608.0,minipainting,2,1.0,False

I (23f) lost my girl today and I am distraught and losing my will to live if that makes any sense. She was my world and she was with me for more  than half of my life. I got her when I was 8 and she is and was my first and only pet. She was the only pet I ever wanted and still remember begging my mom to get me a dog and finally when she said yes I got my girl (Labrador/Dalmatian mix) from girl I used to play volleyball in elementary school. She outlived every dog in our neighbourhood and was fine until 3 days ago. She went so quickly and I feel so guilty because for the last time I couldn‚Äôt help her. I recently moved back to my house with my mom and she literally waited for my mom to come from work to die with both of us present at home. She had heart failure (she was 16 years old almost 17) and today vet even came to our house to see if he could help her with her breathing problem. Just as he left she collapsed then got up one last time to snuggle with my mom and me. It was touching and I was crying because I knew it was end. She died in corner of our backyard (she liked to go out after a meal so I have let her out like I have done so before so she could do her business as usual) while I was following her to help her and snuggle her. It was like she was avoiding my face, she turned her head from me. While dying I was petting her tummy and telling her it won‚Äôt hurt. The vet told us she wasn‚Äôt suffering since she went quickly (she was in bas condition for only 3 days including this day and she even ate today her favourite meal). I am sorry for a long and probably grammatically incorrect term ( I am not native English speaker and I also don‚Äôt live in English speaking country). How can I ever love any dog like her and not feel guilty about it? How can I ever feel like I loved her enough when right now I can‚Äôt even remember our funny moments like everything is blocked in my brain? I got her when she was only 2 months old and I was 8 now I have to live the rest of my adult life without her and it is killing me. We used to drink our first morning coffee with her and tomorrow she won‚Äôt be there. There is no cremation for dogs where I live so we burried her underneath the tree she used to like. Whole house and backyard feels like here and I can‚Äôt escape because everywhere I look she used to be. ",1,1730151510.0,Petloss,4,0.99,False

He comes back and says he needs some space and he would come back in a week. then he says he wants to go casual, see me casually, it offended me and i blocked him on chats. He then texted me on phone number to meet up with him. he says he had been dealing with some addiction issues for a while. I was surprised. then i unblocked him and he again asked to give him some space. and then asked to meet up again after a couple of weeks. then he says he cant do it he lost feelings for me. we both cried a lot. I said is it okay to go NC and then he says he if it would be okay to stay friends and catch up over a coffee or something. so we decided on that to stay connected. we meet a couple of weekends and then he asks again to stay casual it broke my heart at that time but then we sleep together. he said he would make sure we would never get serious again. I felt so bad that i stomped out of the house and went home. all this time we kept in touch on texts

then I missed him so much and then after a few texts exchange i begged him that i dont mind to do casual. he said now he doesnt want it. and he needs space. and to meet for a coffee. we met and he said he wants to move on i cried like an idiot and went home. we kept in touch on texts and agreed to meet as friends every weekend. 

we met two weekends more and I was fine but then out of the blue i started missing him because i could see the changes in his behaviours. he was this another person that made me feel bad, broke promises, keeping my texts on read, reply in 4 hours , cancelling plans without letting me know or with not explanations etc. we met up again and after that  i called him and begged him to give it another chance. he asked me not to text him that much so that he can move on. and asked me to meet for a coffee the next weekend

  
what the fuuuk is going on? what does it mean to ask for space, for me it means to think about things that are bothering and come back on things. which he never did. which made me hopeful. I was okay to go NC at the start and now I feel he has only used me emotionally and sexually to help him move on  and now my head is a big mess. now i cant stop thinking about us to get back together. I feel so bad. also i think he is seeing someone else now. 

  
NB - for those wondering we used to catch up when meeting for coffee, he used to ask every single detail on my life and when i used to ask him he answered vaguely or say nothings happening. in the recent catch ups his answers were not matching up as well.

My brother and his family came for a visit last month. My kids and I play with lego and we have fun leaving little dioramas around my house. Just silly stuff like a fight between Ironman and Darth Vader on the loot llama. It's just our way of leaving Easter eggs around the house. 

My nephew really liked them and decided to take a few home. When we noticed they were missing I asked my brother to bring them back. He said that it was just kids being kids and that he would them back the next time we saw each other. 

I saw him for coffee and I reminded him beforehand that I wanted all our stuff back. He ""forgot"" to bring the ""toys"". Okay. Game on. 

We went over to his place for a BBQ. I told my kids that unless all our stuff was returned to us when we got there literally anything in the house was fair game. Like the godless barbarians they are they went to town. When we left I don't think there were any remotes, small electronics, or beer mugs left at his house. I actually  had to sneak the dog back into the house before we left. 

I started getting calls on our way home. I ignored them. 

When I got home I returned his calls. He said a bunch of stuff was missing from his house. I said I would check with the kids. He said that I fucking well knew what happened and that he wanted his shit back. I said I would box it up and return it the next time we saw eack other. As long as we got our lego back. 

He was at my house with my Lego later that evening. He had even accidentally included stuff that wasn't ours. I returned it and his stuff. I told him that this is how we would be dealing with his kid in the future. 

He is pissed off that he had to make a special trip to return my stuff. My parents think that there is a huge difference between an eight year old taking Lego minifigures and a couple of teenagers pillaging their uncle's house.

 Pointers for Swiftly Selling Merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas

Craigslist is a favored online marketplace where you can vend anything from furnishings and gadgets to automobiles and garments. It's a fantastic platform for promptly selling merchandise, particularly if you reside in a bustling city like Little Rock, Arkansas. Yet, with so many potential purchasers and merchants, it can be daunting to make an impact and sell your merchandise swiftly. In this article, we'll furnish you with some pointers for swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock.

1. Capture high-quality images: When it comes to peddling merchandise on Craigslist, an image is worth a thousand words. If you want to entice potential purchasers, you need to capture high-quality images of the merchandise you're selling. Ensure the illumination is good, and the merchandise is spotless and well-organized. Capture images from numerous perspectives to give potential purchasers a lucid notion of what they're getting. Remember, the finer your images, the more likely you are to appeal to potential purchasers.

2. Craft a captivating depiction: In addition to high-quality images, a captivating depiction is crucial for swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist. Be sure to encompass essential particulars about the merchandise, such as its state, dimensions, hue, and any defects or imperfections. You should also mention any distinctive features or selling points. It's vital to be forthright and transparent in your depiction to dodge any potential misunderstandings with purchasers.

3. Establish a fair price: Pricing your merchandise competitively is pivotal for promptly selling them on Craigslist. Survey similar merchandise being vended in Little Rock to obtain an idea of the market value. You don't want to set your merchandise at too high a price, as this may deter potential purchasers. On the other hand, pricing them too low may prompt suspicion about the quality of the merchandise. Be certain to establish a fair price that reflects the state and value of the merchandise.

4. Be prompt in your responses: Potential purchasers are likely to make inquiries about the merchandise you're vending. It's crucial to be prompt and timely in your communication. If a potential purchaser has a query, be certain to respond promptly and furnish them with the information they require. Being prompt in responses can aid in establishing trust and confidence with potential purchasers, thereby upping the likelihood of a prompt sale.

5. Employ keywords: When posting your merchandise on Craigslist, make certain to utilize keywords in your title and depiction. This will assist potential purchasers in finding your listing when they rummage for specific items. For instance, if you're vending a sofa, make certain to include keywords such as ""comfortable,"" ""like new,"" or ""affordable"" in your depiction. This will augment the visibility of your listing to potential purchasers and bolster the chances of promptly selling your merchandise.

6. Regularly re-post: Craigslist can be a cutthroat marketplace, with new listings being appended frequently. To bolster the visibility of your listings and swiftly sell merchandise, it's advisable to re-post them regularly. This will propel your listings to the top of the search results, rendering them more visible to potential purchasers. Be sure to re-post your merchandise every few days to optimize their visibility.

7. Propose delivery: In some instances, proposing delivery for your merchandise can expedite their sale on Craigslist. Not everyone has access to a vehicle to fetch larger items, so proposing delivery can make your listing more appealing to potential purchasers. However, be sure to levy a fair fee for delivery to ensure it's worth your time and effort.

8. Prioritize safety: When vending merchandise on Craigslist, it's paramount to prioritize your safety and security. Always meet potential purchasers in a public place, such as a coffee shop or shopping mall. Refrain from inviting strangers to your home or sharing personal information, such as your address or phone number, until you feel at ease and assured in the potential purchaser.

9. Exploit social media: In complement to listing your merchandise on Craigslist, it can be advantageous to publicize them on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This will bolster the visibility of your listings and reach a larger audience of potential purchasers in Little Rock, Arkansas.

10. Extend discounts: Extending a discount or promotion on your merchandise can hasten their sale on Craigslist. For instance, you could offer a 10% discount for merchandise sold within a certain timeframe or bundle multiple items together for a reduced price. Purchasers are often enticed by deals and promotions, so extending discounts can aid in appealing to potential purchasers and swiftly selling your merchandise.

In conclusion, swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas necessitates a blend of high-quality images, compelling depictions, fair pricing, and prompt communication. By employing these pointers and strategies, you can amplify the visibility of your listings, entice potential purchasers, and promptly and efficiently sell your merchandise. Remember to prioritize safety and security when interacting with potential purchasers and exploit social media to publicize your listings. With these pointers in mind, you'll be well on your way to swiftly selling merchandise on Craigslist in Little Rock, Arkansas.

6 months ago I decided to make a change and quit my job and start travelling around for a while. First on my list - Brazil. I have always wanted to get to know my Brazilian heritage and get a true Brazilian experience across as much of the country as possible.

I decided to embark on a 3 month trip across the country.

**Prep**

I decided I had 3 goals before this trip:

* Learn a foundational level of Portuguese - *I used Preply for this and had an excellent tutor. This was ESSENTIAL*, *you simply cannot connect with people and culture as much without it.*
* Obtain a Brazilian passport through descendancy of a Brazilian - *this took roughly 2 months, quite a lot of paperwork but a relatively straightforward process through my local embassy*
* Secure a volunteering opportunity somewhere - preferably in a school - *this trip was also a chance to escape a boring job that I was dissatisfied with, so I wanted to do something rewarding. I found a place looking for someone to teach some English in a small town near Sao Luiz*

**My Top 10s -** *I decided to compile my favourite food, music & places that I ate, heard and saw respectively, it's not gospel but it truly is my favourite things about Brazil*

*Songs*

1. Nao Quero Dinheiro (Tim Maia)
2. Corcovado (Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim and Gilberto Gil)
3. Burguesinha (Seu Jorge)
4. Felicidade (Seu Jorge)
5. Exagerado (Cazuza)
6. Evid√™ncias (Chit√£ozinho & Xoror√≥)
7. Flor de Lis (Djavan)
8. Aquarela do Brasil (Cover - Gal Costa)
9. Gostava Tanto De Voc√™ (Tim Maia)
10. V√°rias queixas (Gilsons)

*Locations¬†- these are the places I went to on my trip*

1. Len√ß√≥is Maranhense¬†- *simply out of this world*
2. Fernando De Noronha¬†
3. Amazonas (Manaus + rainforest!)
4. Foz de Igua√ßu¬†
5. Parque Chapada Diamantina¬†
6. Pelourinho, Salvador do Bahia
7. P√£o de A√ß√∫car, Rio de Janeiro¬†
8. Olinda
9. Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro
10. Liberdade, S√£o Paulo

*Food*

1. Coxinha
2. Cocada
3. Feijoada¬†
4. P√£o de Queijo
5. Doce de leite
6. Brigadeiro
7. Churrasco
8. Tapioca¬†
9. Acaraj√©¬†
10. Farofa¬†

**The Good**¬†\- *unserious, but wonderful small things that I just love about Brazil*

1. Comida por kilo (food by the kilo) - *the best way to eat, good, clean and cheap food*
2. Cheap havaianas¬†
3. Samba street parties¬†
4. Carreta furac√£o¬†- *honestly google this, it's simply hilarious.*

**The Ugly** ***/ Bad***

1. Bureaucracy (burocracia) - *everything and I mean everything requires either ID, form submission or some kind of verification. It's tiresome and god can make me tired*
2. Podr√£o - *god this food is just ass, get me a kebab when Im drunk!*
3. CPF requirements¬†*- without this your life is so much harder in Brazil, I had one but it limits foreigners who aren't as lucky as I am to have a Brazilian dad!*
4. Any <50 centavos coin¬†- *seriously anytime I received a coin I almost never used it. Had a small bucket by the end.*

**Conclusion**

I set out get a deeper understanding of this weird, wonderful and wacky country. I achieved this - but I can see I have only scratched the surface of what Brazil really can do for you. Some of it's greatest flaws are also some if it's greatest strengths. For example, the bureaucracy - it's painful and frustrating but as we say '**Jeitinho**' an expression to denote getting through social situations with charm. Often I wasn't able to buy a bus ticket/enter a park/order what I wanted but with some portuguese charm you could find a way through it.

Brazil has it's problems but the people are loving, welcoming and fantastically¬†funky. Brazil has it all - unbelievable landscapes and beautiful people inside and out.

I still have much to learn to truly un-gringo myself but I am loving the journey and can't wait to return.

They are seniors in high school. Three years ago, during the freshman orientation for them, another parent introduced herself, flirted a bit, asked me to coffee, and we have been dating ever since. She has a daughter (17F) in the same grade. For most of our relationship, the daughter lived primarily with her dad, who was quite wealthy. The school the kids go to is private, both my kids were there on scholarship, GF's daughter's dad paid for it out of pocket.

GF's daughter's dad is hemorrhaging money because his business was hit with a big civil judgment about a year ago. He was able to get enough money to pay for the high school this year, but paying for college will be out of the question. 

I have through the years, saved a fair amount for my kids. It will be enough for each of them to go to college, wherever they want for undergrad, with some left over. 

Unbeknownst to me, my ex's parents, who are very well off, had put some money aside for my kids as well. We have no relationship them. They are devout Mormons. They disowned my ex when we had our kids out of wedlock. (I also think me being black was a factor, although they deny that.) But, it is more than 4x as much as I had saved. They reached out and have given me half of what they saved to use on the kids. But, if we want the other half, they want my kids to form a relationship with them. 

I am letting my kids decide if they want a relationship with that side of the family. In any case, my GF wants me to use this extra money, at least some of it, to help out her daughter with college. I refuse. My perspective is that she has two parents that can help, scholarships, financial aid, etc. Plus, my kids might want to go to grad school, buy a house, start a business, etc., and this extra money can help them do that. She retorts that if they need more money, there is always the option of forming the relationship with the grandparents and getting it. 

My girlfriend is calling me selfish, an AH, etc.

1geddcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1geddcm/freezing_roasted_beans/,freezing roasted beans.,"I buy coffee beans from the same roaster for many years (10?). and I typically get between 5 and 8 lbs at the time (in 1 lb bags.)

The moment the beans get delivered they go into the freezer for over night. The next day I vacuum pack all the bags, and back to the freezer.   When I need to open a bag I take it out of the freezer, let it come to room temperature before I open the vacuum. If I would open the bag while the beans are frozen, the humidity in the air will condensate on the beans. 

I transfer the beans into a zip bag and keep it in a countertop container with ""hermetic"" cover.

I know this process keeps the beans fresh for longer. Before the pandemic the roaster used 2 day shipping and the beans arrived so fresh they were still degassing.  And when I pulled a vacuumed bag out of the freezer, even after a couple of months, as the bag warms up, it will start degassing again, and will inflate the vacuum bag. :)

Please give me grace as you read this. It certainly has a lot of venting, try as I did to avoid that, and stick to being objective. 

Due to a lot of changing life factors - health, career, finances, (a lot of ups, downs, and changes to adjust to) we,  sadly, have pretty much put sex on pause. We are young, 26 and 24. I have tried my very best to not 'keep score' but, I know it was around January of this year when things really dropped off. We went from weekly, to maybe once a month, maybe. I - I have tried my absolute best to keep things feeling happy and fun. I've kept up showing her I care with little gifts while I'm out, or acts of service around the house. Got her a candle on a small work trip just a couple days ago. Its just, gone on so long now, I dont know. 

I've only recently brought this up to her after much internal sadness about it. She suffers from a chronic arthritis illness and was taking anti-depression medication, which is terrible, because she is suffering and here I am complaining to the internet about sex.

*Clearly I am a dick, I accept it. please just hear me out and offer advice. I'd like to fix this but I dont know how to move on.* 

In the winter, she was in school working on her feet, which is hard for her, and so I chalked most of the change up to that. Just kept on hoping for the future. This summer she was able to secure her dream internship which was a desk job at a great hospital, and I was really happy she was away from service jobs that stressed her body and caused her pain. And winter isnt great for people with arthritis anyway. She also started an anti-depressant around this time. 

 So, we moved in together this summer and she started her internship at the hospital. Unpaid sadly, I covered her car payments and a bunch of other stuff over that time. Which was extended because the hospital really dragged its feet getting her started. But I was happy to do it, because she was able to get her dream job WFH through this, and it seems like a great fit for her shes very happy there. Shes nice, and felt bad that I had to cover these expenses which effected her esteem, and thus her libido, she expressed. So, things sort of stayed the way they were. I did some reading, tried to de-center sex in my life, and just be happy. At one point I did buy her lingerie, I though it maybe could help her esteem? But, she said thanks for this and I never saw it again. I did sort of ask what happened to it, and she first said she didn't know how to introduce it in the bedroom, and that it didn't fit. For the record it was one of those bodynet things. But I just took her at her word and accepted it. That one kinda hurt to be honest. 

She is very much a beach girl, and I made great efforts to make sure we had plenty of road trips and fun this summer. I spent a lot of time, researching and coming up with cool things/events to do, as the area we moved to could be described as 'boring'. We had a great time. That was one of my best summers ever. We had many adventures. I wouldn't have missed it for the world but...I mean not to look at it too much but no we didnt really do much sexually beyond cuddling and good night kisses. Many weekends where I felt like we had a great time, I thought maybe we had a shot that evening, even felt like I was getting hints, and then I would be disappointed. Again, maybe once a month together, maybe, to be fair it was really hot with a strugging A/C. I was basically suffering in silence, happily, again just hoping for the future really. And, fell back into masturbation pretty hard. Maybe we weren't having such a great time. She said it was a great summer and she had fun. 

In July we were at the beach, and I couldn't get out of the water for some time because I had an erection that just WOULD NOT go away. I was thinking about dead fish for like 20 minutes trying to kill this thing. And well, she kept on encouraging me to leave the water. And I refused to say exactly why I wouldn't. I know people nearby were listening to us go back and forth, and probably figured out WAY before she did what was going on.  At that time, I was trying to avoid masturbating at all, in hope that it might do something for us, or at least I had to be available if the chance arose. Long story short it did eventually go away, but the whole exerience was very embarassing for me. I brought this up much later to her and she had no idea what was happening there I guess. 

In August, I was sent to a conference for work. In the days before I left, I could tell she as getting nervous I was going with a woman coworker. I expressed, not attracted to her at all, anything you need to feel secure I will give it. So most nights of the conference I facetimed her that evening before I fell asleep, gave her a full run-down of the day. No, I did not have an affair at a work conference. What did happen is a woman my age heavily flirted with me on the bus back to the hotel. She got seated next to me, and was complimenting me, talking to me, and finding ways to touch my arms, legs, and hands an awful lot for someone you just met. I'm no Fabio but I can take a hint. And I turned her down, not that she flat out asked me, but I did not go out of my to find her once we were off the bus. I just went to my room and facetimed my SO. But what did happen is I remembered what it felt like to be *desired* physically. I felt interesting, sexy, desired, things I hadn't felt in awhile. 

I proposed to her at the end of summer. Like I had always intended to. I had promised her, and I meant it. We did not do anything \*special\* that night. To reiterate, its not the focus, its just I'd like a little \*sprinkle sprinkle\* sometimes, felt like that was a special occaison, idk maybe. 

So, she was able to get her dream job working from home. I am very happy for her. She doesn't have to be in pain nearly as much. And her coworkers are so friendly I'm honestly jealous. And she can stay home and love on our cats. With our new dual income we were able to move into a nicer, larger apartment, with significantly less stairs, something else that had caused her trouble. Again I was hoping, things might get better with this, she might turn to me again. 

I feel terrible. Because I may have accidentally put her in this pressure cooker of sex and killed our relationship doing so.  I've brought up some of my feelings 3 weeks ago, and I think it's scared her a lot. I'm no yeller. I actually wrote everything down and read to her because I don't like being scary. It was very similar to this post, I didn't bring up Minnesota, that seems needlessly harmful. I did mention, 'hey you used to send me a sexy picture occaisonally while we were long-distance, maybe we could try that again.' But that never materialized. When we first moved in, she mentioned 'ohh i brought condoms too just in case'. So, I got my hopes up. 2-3 weeks after we've moved in, nothing. I tried to initiate, and was rejected. That one really did me in. And today she said she started her period, so I know for sure there is no chance.

Its hard getting your hopes up. What I think the problem is, is I'm getting my hopes up, and when it doesn't work out like I hoped. I get sorta sad. And I try to not let her see that, I did a good job of hiding the last couple months. But recently I can't hide it anymore. I just get idk sort grouchy/sad. 

I try really hard to hide it because I understand no one likes to be guilted into something. But last time she caught me bein grouchy I admitted this whole thing has made me pretty nervous about the future together. She expressed she was disappointed I didnt feel any better than I did 3 weeks ago. And I told her 'I've been feeling this way for months, Its going to take more than touching my butt 2 times to fix things'. I did not bring up that she completely ignored my sexy photo compromise. I brought up that I'm at least aware that I have unintentionally put some pressure on her, that I'm sorry, and im grateful for what we have and maybe we just need to go cold-turkey from sex to cool the pressure. I suggested two months. She literally gasped and said something to the tune of ""i can't believe you would suggest that long"" 

Things haven't been great, we're mostly moved in now. She complains about how hard moving was and how sore she is when I am the chap that moved 90% of things down 3 sets of stairs. She packed the boxes. I know, I know, moving is stressful, I'm trying to extend that grace. I'm just absolutely sick of ""why dont we move the \_\_\_"" today. OK ""we"" is going to be me. 

Now, she is going the extra mile to tell me when shes unpacking and putting stuff away, making it feel like a home. But, she skipped doing dishes for like a week, left her laundry literally freaking everywhere, and totally skipped her turn(s) cleaning the litterbox. It smelled f'ing disgusting. This did not used to bother me, but since shes mentioned me not fufilling these household tasks as a reason for our, or my issues, I'm trying to be more aware. And what I became aware of is the dishes only bother her if its my turn. She doesn't give a hoot when its her turn. Maybe that was just a byproduct of moving, its possible.  

We're hoping maybe celebrating halloween with friends in a couple days + a long weekend to recoup might rekindle something for us. She mentioned maybe a coffee & antiquing date together, whatever 'sounds best to me'............I want some peace and quiet. We've done many many dates together Ive had it. I've gotten my hopes up so many times, I dont want to ride that ride again. I cant keep yo-yoing like this. I cant keep hoping anymore. even if she did initiate, I so desperately do not want to go back to that pain again. Being so pathetic I get sad when a sex scene comes on in Friends because theyre having wayyyyy more fun than I am, and hey we are the same age...terrific. 

 I want to get back to my hobbies, and do them by myself, as long as I want. I want to be alone. I want to do what I want to do, without having to worry about someones feelings. I want that day entirely to myself. I dont want to do what she wants to do, coffee and antiquing. Thats stuff SHE likes. She proposes it because she has no idea what I like. But I know she wont take this well. Back to square 1. 

So, thats my sob story. I know someof you identify with this, I've been lurking for awhile. Kills me though. I feel wayyyyyyyy to young to be having these issues. 

As always there are 3 parts to a story: what I say happened, what she says happened, and what really happened. 

I'm sure I've probably missed signs from her, made it worse, I'm just so tired of being hurt. I want to feel authentically desired. Honestly I want the pain to end. I disassembled my gun as a precaution. So, all good there I guess.  Don't worry about me ill be fine. Hopefully one of you identifies with this, and feels less alone. 



tl;dr

When it comes to intimacy, and being physical, how do you not get your hopes up in daily life - and create pressure on your spouse?

So, we‚Äôve only been together for a few months now and the beginning was wonderful. For the first time ever I felt someone appreciated me and loved me the way I am and I loved (and still love him) very much. 

For a while ago it all has changed though. He often ignores almost everything I try to talk to him and this can continue for days until I just give up and leave his apartment to calm down. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I try to talk to him, he doesn‚Äôt answer anything. He doesn‚Äôt compliment me in any ways anymore and he doesn‚Äôt touch me at all in any situation. 

I have some difficult mental health problems but he always tells me how I have no reason to be depressed and it‚Äôs stupid how bad I‚Äôm feeling because I have no reason. And actually I have a lot of past trauma and ‚Äùreasons‚Äù even though I really don‚Äôt think you even have to have any reasons to be depressed. When I once had cried all day for my terrible feeling, I asked him why couldn‚Äôt he comfort me, even just hold me close and cuddle. He said he doesn‚Äôt want to. He rather plays games or watches movies than even asks me what‚Äôs wrong. 

Still he always expects me to take care of him and comfort him if he feels bad. He says his mental health problems are ‚Äùreal‚Äù and he has reasons to feel bad unlike me. He also expects me to clean up his home, make food, make coffee and do all those things when I come to his apartment. 

I have tried to talk to him how I feel he doesn‚Äôt want me anymore and how bad I feel ‚Äôcause of his cold and distant behaviour but he always just says he doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm getting ‚Äùmad‚Äù at him if he even listens. Sometimes he still asks me questions like ‚ÄùDo you hate me now?‚Äù, but never clearly tries to think of if he could do something differently. He seems to be one of those people who always finds flaws from other people and their behaviour, but never his own. 

I understand the beginning of a new relationship is always different than the time after it, but I don‚Äôt think that in a good relationship I should feel like he thinks I‚Äôm disgusting and that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt want to touch my body. I know I don‚Äôt look like a model, but so does not many other people. 

It hurts to think of it, but I‚Äôm wondering if he just got bored once he got me as his girlfriend and realized I‚Äôm not as awesome as he thought? Some people just seem to be like that: when the ‚Äùchase‚Äù is over, they don‚Äôt want it anymore. If I ask him does he still love me, he says yes, but he never says it by himself. 

I don‚Äôt know and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd really want to see what other people think of this situation. ",0,1730149373.0,relationship_advice,3,0.33,False

##What‚Äôs the Best Breed?

*‚ÄúI kind of wanted a German shepherd or Doberman but I got a Labrador. [...]*

*I will always promote Labradors, they are the most popular breed for service work for a reason. They were AKCs #1 breed for 30 years in a row for a reason. I‚Äôd highly recommend them to anyone because they can match most everyone‚Äôs lifestyle and needs when it comes to service work.‚Äù*

/u/TheServiceDragon (Dog Trainer) [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1fyi4ej/breed_choice_experience/lqzabp3/)

The most widely accepted ‚Äúbest breed‚Äù for a service dog is overwhelmingly: Labrador Retriever. Full stop.

##Can‚Äôt any breed be a service dog?

*‚ÄúAs a lawyer, the numbers on access issue complaints for 1st time handlers of large/non-standard, and ‚Äútoy‚Äù breeds in similar locations and situations is just a whole different file than the same locations and situations for early handlers of 3 breeds we typically recommend the most on this sub‚Äù*

/u/Burkeintosh [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1g1d0ek/tell_me_your_stories_of_your_own_off_breed/lrfo8r6/)

**Please read all of this with an open mind and good intentions. The information here is not based on a bias for Retrievers; this guide is based on best practices from the most reputable service dog programs and trainers across the world.**

‚ÄúCan [X] be a service dog?‚Äù is the most dangerous question asked on this sub. I won‚Äôt lie‚Äì the answer is technically ‚Äúyes.‚Äù The ‚Äúfab 5‚Äù breeds commonly cited are Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Standard Poodle, German Shepherd, and Rough/Smooth Collie (a great deal of debate surrounds the last ‚Äúfab 4‚Äù dog after Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, and Standard Poodle. I‚Äôm avoiding that debate by simply referring to the ‚Äúfab 5‚Äù.) Any breed outside of those five breeds are considered ‚Äúoff breed‚Äù choices.

Why is it dangerous to suggest that any dog can be a service dog? Many novices will use this question as a means to justify their own desires. Many people visiting this sub don‚Äôt ask about breeds in good faith; they visit the sub out of confirmation bias, thus hoping to get the answer they are looking for. There can be a dozen thoughtful responses about why a desired breed is ill-suited for the task at hand, or service work in general. 

Novice visitors to this sub are eager to seize on the rare off-breed success story. They love northern breeds, herding breeds, guardian breeds, or mixed-breed rescues, and they are convinced that if only they could turn their favorite dog into a service dog, their medical issues would be that much more manageable. This is heartfelt thinking, but it is wishful and dangerous.

**Please, if you are reading this guide: listen to overwhelming community and expert consensus.**

The ‚Äúfab 5‚Äù has begun to be reconsidered as the international service dog community recognizes that there are two types of dog who stand heads above the rest. As seen in the video linked above, the focus now is on the ‚ÄúDynamic Duo‚Äù or ‚ÄúTerrific Two‚Äù: Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers. 


##Why is breed so important?

Please understand that you are getting a service dog for your health. Picking a suitable breed should override any personal biases or preferences not directly related to your medical condition.

Raising and training a service dog will be one of the most time-consuming, frustrating, and expensive things you do in your life. We are all disabled here. There is no reason to make this difficult experience even harder than it needs to be.

Service dogs are very expensive treatment tools. Picking a poorly suited breed vastly increases the likelihood that they will wash from public access and thus become unsuitable to work in non-pet friendly public spaces. Washing a dog means that you have to get another dog and start over. If you can‚Äôt have two dogs (due to financial or housing circumstances), you have to rehome the puppy you spent years and countless thousands of dollars training. 

You must not approach this journey with the mindset of ‚ÄúIf they wash, that‚Äôs okay. I just won‚Äôt have a service dog and I‚Äôll have them as a pet instead‚Äù. 

This attitude is setting yourself up for failure. The reason to get a service dog is to mitigate your disability. You‚Äôre not able to thrive or be independent because of your condition. A service dog is a treatment tool to help you bridge the gap from ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù to ‚Äúthrive.‚Äù If this is a journey you are willing to give up, then you are undermining yourself and your health. 

A service dog is a treatment tool similar to physical therapy, psychological counseling, or medication. The goal is to use the treatment tools to mitigate your disability and improve your quality of life. If you find that medication isn‚Äôt working for you, you don‚Äôt give up on taking medication entirely. You work with your treatment team to find the right medication.

As owner trainers, we have to be willing to make impossible decisions. If this is a journey you are truly serious about, you need to be willing to wash a dog and rehome them. Or you need to be able and willing to let them be an at-home service dog while you get another service prospect. If you are not willing to make these decisions, a service dog may not be the right treatment tool for you (right now). 

Instead, I would recommend pursuing an Emotional Support Animal as a treatment tool instead. These are dogs, cats, rabbits, and other types of animals that bring a disabled person comfort by their mere presence. There‚Äôs no pressure on the animal‚Äôs level of training, behaviour in public, or their temperament. On this subreddit we do hear success stories of Emotional Support Animal owners who have a huge improvement in their disability. The act of caring for a creature and meeting their needs can be a very positive thing. Using a dog as an ESA forces people to frequently leave their house for walks and potty breaks. These may seem simple, but they can have a major impact on a person‚Äôs quality of life.

(Note: wash criteria and the complexities of at-home work and public access work are far outside the scope of this document. For questions about those topics, please search the subreddit first, and then make a post if you have additional questions.)

I had put a post up asking people to submit their stories of [‚ÄúWhat off breed did you get, and why shouldn‚Äôt others get it‚Äù]( https://www.reddit.com/r/service_dogs/comments/1g1d0ek/tell_me_your_stories_of_your_own_off_breed/). I intended to post a couple short blurbs here, but the post popped off way more than anticipated, and people took their time to write out their stories in long form to help give context. Please go give it a read. You can search (ctrl+f) your desired breed to try and find stories.

Below all the statements about appropriate breeds, I will include a section talking about off breeds.

##What characteristics make a good service dog?

*‚ÄúIf you need a minivan and buy a sports car, you can‚Äôt be mad when the sports car can‚Äôt handle carrying a family‚Äôs worth of crap on the weekdays, and your kayaking bikes on the weekends. I don‚Äôt care how cool the sports car looks when you ride around in it, you need the car that is actually built for the job that you need it to do, and makes your life easier. Even if everyone owns a minivan and you think that‚Äôs super lame, still just buy the minivan, and then personalize it with a cool racing stripe or maybe a fancy collar.‚Äù*

-Laura, Doggy-U [(source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZEREOVWh-o)

Ideal characteristics in a service dog include the following:

* Friendly and comfortable around people and other animals
* Able to handle a wide variety of situations without becoming stressed
* Handler-focused
* Alert, but not quick to react on their own
* Intelligent and trainable
* Eager to please
* Calm temperament

Characteristics to avoid in a service dog:

* Suspicious/protective natures
* Independent/aloof
* Low drive/lack of interesting in training
* High drive 
* High energy 
* Reactive (fear, aggression, barking)
* Prone to anxiety

Labradors are described by the Canadian Kennel Club as gentle, intelligent, kind and outgoing, eager to please, and non-aggressive.

In contrast, German Shepherds are described by the Canadian Kennel Club as intelligent, quick to learn, but also loyal and protective of their home and property.

Labs check all the boxes on what we want to see in a service dog. While German Shepherds do have many desirable traits, their loyal and protective nature can, in some instances, backfire and become undesirable behaviours and temperaments. 

##‚ÄúUnicorn‚Äù Dogs

An important concept we discuss in service dog communities is the idea of a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù dog. No, they don‚Äôt have horns and aren‚Äôt creatures of legend. A ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù is that special dog who succeeds despite being a breed whose behavior, temperament, and other qualities that generally make them unsuitable for service work.

This is another dangerous idea onto which many novice handlers latch. Calling them a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù is meant to illustrate just how rare and special these dogs can be. 

Service dogs require a very specific temperament to succeed, especially for any public access work. While yes, any breed can be a service dog, not all breeds have the innate temperament to succeed in service work. For breeds who have protective instincts, that runs counter to the qualities needed for a service dog; for everyone‚Äôs safety, service dogs need to be neutral and not suspicious. Breeds that are typically aloof do not display the behavior needed from a service dog, as they should be attuned and attentive to their handler.

I want to address negative perceptions about ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù dogs. Not all handlers go into this journey starting from zero. There are a large number of success stories from handlers who had a pet that was not considered a typical service dog breed. These prospective handlers know their personal dog, and with the help of professional trainers they can decide whether their dog is suitable for service work. When they‚Äôre at that point, it‚Äôs common to hear that the dog is already naturally alerting to the handler because of their long term connection. The dog is inherently a unicorn because of that connection. Conversely, we do also see posts from folks who say they have a dog from a breed that shows typical characteristics that aren‚Äôt well suited for a service dog, and want to know if the dog can be trained to do service work. The standard answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù.

I‚Äôll discuss more about unicorn dogs, and using your pet dog as a service dog, further below.

------------

##Why get a Labrador Retriever

This section will largely summarize the Doggy-U video I posted in the resources above. The material about Labradors generally applies to Golden Retrievers as well. A lot of the qualities for service dog success (that is, the necessary temperament) is built into these two breeds.

* Retrievers are ‚Äúgun dogs.‚Äù Over the centuries, they have been bred to chill out for long periods, quickly go do a task (retrieve a bird), come back to their handler and resume to chilling out. This pattern describes the majority of what a service dog will be doing for you. Chill, task, resume chill. Breed purpose aligns perfectly.
* ‚ÄúGun dogs‚Äù also have soft mouths by nature of their historical purpose. This makes them perfect for retrieval tasks of delicate items (hello, expensive smartphones!)
* They‚Äôre bred to work in conjunction with a handler and take direction
* They‚Äôre bred to be ‚Äúbomb proof‚Äù. Guns are not quiet. These dogs were bred to not react excessively to sudden loud noises, and to recover quickly if startled. Public access is full of sudden, loud, and surprising noises.
* Retrievers can be easy to exercise on days when you‚Äôve got low energy. As long as you can throw a ball, your dog can essentially exercise themselves! This is not a long-term replacement for proper exercise, but it can help you on days where you‚Äôre not able to meet their exercise needs otherwise. 
* Many handlers have retrieval based tasks. This aligns with the breed‚Äôs innate desire to retrieve, which makes them much more likely to enjoy the work and thus find it fulfilling
* The Labrador Retriever standard allows dogs between 55-80lbs. This is a huge range that lets handlers pick a size that they need, and are comfortable with (perfect for customizing how much pressure you want in your deep pressure therapy)
* You can customize the level of energy you want them to have. Show dogs typically have less energy, whereas field dogs are able to keep up with highly active lifestyles
* Short coat! Grooming needs are easier compared to Goldens, Poodles, Bernese Mountain dogs, Cocker Spaniels, and so on
* They‚Äôre bred to be friendly and work alongside and nearby other handlers and dogs. Some may say that being too friendly is a negative trait, but training neutrality is MUCH EASIER from a dog that‚Äôs too friendly compared to a dog that‚Äôs too suspicious (which can disqualify a dog from service work entirely)
* It‚Äôs much easier to find Retriever breeders who have experience with service dogs compared to off breed kennels that breed for sport or work.

##‚ÄúScary dog privilege‚Äù

* This is something that we perceive as handlers and is often not a factor for the general public
* Many novice handlers want to get a dog that will look scary enough to deter members of the public from approaching them. Often that will mean they get a dog that is recognized for protection work,which is the exact opposite temperament you want in a service dog. As soon as a dog does protection work, whether trained or naturally learned, it is no longer suitable to be a service dog (either by ethical or legal standards)
* ‚ÄúScary breeds‚Äù often increase the attention you receive in public. ‚ÄúScary‚Äù looking breeds such as a Rottweiler, Doberman, or Belgian Shepherd may not deter people at all. People will still try to interact with you and/or your dog just because they‚Äôve never seen them in a doctor‚Äôs office or grocery store before
* The best solution is to get a black Labrador Retriever. Research shows that many people unconsciously perceive large, dark dogs as scarier than other types. Put a tactical harness on your dog; don‚Äôt use bright patches or fancy gear. Get a spiked leather collar if you want (read: not chained or pronged solely for appearance). And get a male in the larger size range. The experienced handlers on this sub can assure you that you‚Äôre not going to be unduly bothered with a large black dog.

##When it‚Äôs a good idea to get a larger breed

Sometimes, getting a larger dog is necessary for medical reasons. 

* You need really deep pressure therapy. (Personal anecdote: I am a bigger guy [username checks out.] I can have my 70 lb Golden Retriever lay fully on top of me while I‚Äôm laying down for 30 mins without issue. It scratches the itch but never quite fully relieves my symptoms. I‚Äôm looking into a heavier breed for my next dog, but I will still be considering the positive attributes of a Lab as part of making that decision)
* You are a tall person who needs mobility tasks. Dogs that you rely on for mobility should be a specific height in relation to you, and Labradors may not quite match up even at the high end of the breed standards. (Note: mobility work where you put any weight on the dog needs to wait until they are 2 years old, and they need to have a full veterinary workup including OFAs to ensure that mobility work would be safe for the dog. Ensure that your breeder provides a 2-year genetic health guarantee in case there are any issues)

Cautions:

* Larger breeds inherently come with shorter lifespans. This means fewer working years, which means needing a new dog more frequently, and all the costs that come with it. This is an expensive road to take on your service dog journey
* Due to their size, these dogs don‚Äôt fit well into tight spaces. If you are looking for public access work and routinely want to visit coffee shops, restaurants, or ride a bus or an airplane, you will have a great deal of difficulty tucking them out of the way. There legitimately might just not be enough space for where you want them to go with you

Breed recommendations:

* Bernese Mountain Dog
* Great Dane

##When it‚Äôs a good idea to get a smaller breed

As above, sometimes getting a smaller breed is necessary for medical reasons. Some of these are the inverse of larger breeds

* You need lighter deep pressure therapy because you are shorter/lighter etc. (Note: this is not discussing light pressure therapy [LPT] which is very different. The community has debated whether LPT is a valid task, but that is outside the scope of this guide)

Cautions:

* Because of their small size, small dogs can sometimes be in danger on the ground in busy places. Many handlers turn to using a sling or backpack for their dog to keep them safe. This is a totally valid situation and a way to keep your dog close by so they can still alert, and stay safe. Still, many handlers report higher access issues because the general public will immediately dismiss a carried dog as more than a pet
* Small dogs inherently have longer lifespans. This is a caution because a small dog may live well past retirement, increasing the chances you will have multiple dogs on hand as you go through successors.
* ‚ÄúRetrieval‚Äù-type tasks become much more limited. For example, you can‚Äôt necessarily expect a small dog to be able to bring you your phone or a water bottle, since those depend on the size of the dog and their mouth
* Mobility tasks likewise are typically often out of bounds for these smaller dogs. They simply aren‚Äôt big enough to turn on a light switch, or press the accessible/automatic door buttons.

Breed recommendations:

* Cocker Spaniel
* Miniature/Toy Poodle

##Other considerations for selecting a breed

There are other medical reasons why a person would select a specific dog over another.

* Sensory sensitivity: there are some folks who have sensory sensitivity to certain textures or feel. These factors like general oiliness of a coat, rough or smooth coat, or curl of a coat, as well as length of a coat. Within the commonly recommended dogs, you can truly find most any combination you‚Äôd need
* Allergies: this is a hot button topic. People select poodles as they are commonly touted as ‚Äúhypoallergenic‚Äù due to their lower amount of shedding. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that there are three primary allergens a dog produces: hair, dander, and saliva. Just because a dog doesn‚Äôt shed, doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt react to dander or saliva. (Personal anecdote, I didn‚Äôt think I was allergic to dogs at all until I started having minor reactions to my guy licking me. Not enough to be an issue or any real bother, but enough to be a noticeable quirk)
* Grooming requirements: due to disability/income, some breeds may just be impossible for a handler to properly maintain their grooming. Regular grooming (like brushing their coat multiple times per week) will certainly prevent the worst issues, but even that is too much for some. Thankfully, Labs have nice easy short coats!

##You‚Äôre still convinced you don‚Äôt want any of the above 

Honestly if you‚Äôve read this far and you‚Äôre still not convinced, then it‚Äôs appreciated that you‚Äôve been willing to read with an open mind. Thank you for being mindful about your choice.

When we talk about off breeds, a lot of it truly comes down to how much extra work they may need to succeed as a service dog. It can take a lot of time and money to develop management strategies to minimize inherent breed qualities that are not ideal for a service dog. But that distracts from YOU and YOUR needs. A service dog is a treatment tool meant to support you, and make your life easier.

We are disabled, and that often means we have less energy or ability to devote to a dog‚Äôs training. That said, not all disabilities make off breeds prohibitive. The most common dogs we see discussed on the subreddit are psychiatric service dogs, and psychiatric disabilities present in many different ways. Somebody with PTSD may have an active lifestyle and a lot of energy that they are able to devote to ‚Äúmanaging‚Äù an off breed. In contrast, somebody with depression or bipolar 2 who goes through long periods of time where it can be difficult or impossible to find that motivation to leave the house, or train at all, may not be able to manage an off breed consistently enough to find success. Consider your personal circumstances, and long-term limits your disability imposes on you.

*[Her] experience is instructive in this regard. Catbird got a black Belgian Malinois as her prospect; she knew that her dog ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äù would compete in sport if ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äù didn‚Äôt make it as a service dog. ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äù has turned out to be a fine service dog; she has six tasks and counting, has taken more than 24 flights in the first two years of her life, traveled internationally, and earned her first AKC obedience title before the age of two. Why did Catbird succeed? As a disabled veteran who largely works from home, she has the time, resources, and experience to handle a high-drive and high-energy off-breed. ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äù is an environmentally focused dog who doesn‚Äôt feed off Catbird‚Äôs emotions; ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äù also has plenty of opportunities to satisfy her desire to chase prey, play tug, and do lots of other Belgian things. Catbird is able to manage most of her symptoms without ‚ÄúVanessa‚Äôs‚Äù help. If Catbird needed more support, it would be difficult for her to manage a dog such as ‚ÄúVanessa.‚Äù*

A key step you can take to setting yourself up for success with an off breed is to find some local handlers or professional trainers who have experience with the breed. Ask if you can sit in on a training session, or just offer to buy them a beverage and ask them some questions about their experience. A one-on-one format gives better opportunity for these types of conversations, compared to reddit. Take time to ask important questions about what lifestyle they have to support the dog, and how they meet the dog‚Äôs needs. Ask what issues they‚Äôve faced in training, public access, anything that you might be worried or curious about. (For a trainer, they may ask you to pay for a consult session - don‚Äôt balk at that, their time is valuable and they are great resources).

Unicorn dogs can be sought out. My most sincere recommendation is to start your journey as a handler on ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù, with a Labrador Retriever. Once you have experience as a handler and are more confident in your own skills, then go get your dream breed (taking everything here into consideration). Remember that this journey lasts through the rest of your life/ability. You will have more than one service dog; you don‚Äôt need to immediately jump into hard mode/your desired breed.

The best way to obtain a unicorn dog is by working with well established, reputable, and ethical breeders (who can often be unicorns themselves). You cannot simply find a breeder and choose the best pup from among the litter. You need to be willing to wait out multiple litters to find the best candidate. You need a breeder who is willing to work closely with you. And we have heard stories that many breeders are not willing to go through this type of process with a handler, let alone provide dogs for service work at all. Thus the process of seeking out a unicorn is a massive, long term undertaking, so it really is better suited for your second prospect. You won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre in as much of a rush and you‚Äôll have the ability to take your time.

##Can I use a rescue or shelter dog as a service dog?

*‚ÄúFor that one fairy tale story, I have 30 dogs that just weren‚Äôt the right fit for public access service dog work.‚Äù*

Laura, DOGGY-U [(source)](https://youtu.be/HnOAIxIQoew?si=JD3ZV6gvvcZMbPOT)

(credit to /u/FluidCreature for writing the basis of this section, I edited for clarity and additional content)

This is another dangerous question, because the answer again is technically yes. I included the above quote very purposefully though to illustrate how stacked the odds can be against you. If this path is a serious consideration for you, watch the above video. More than once.

We see a lot of people here who say they want to adopt a shelter/rescue dog as a service dog. Most frequently in my experience, they cite cost as the deciding factor. But making the decision based on up-front costs is not wise, as there‚Äôs a potential for shelter/rescue dogs to cost more in the long run, at least in the case of wanting a dog for public access work. I‚Äôll discuss some of those factors.

Shelters/rescues typically can‚Äôt offer any genetic health information or familial health history like an ethical breeder can. This means you‚Äôre taking a gamble on the health of this dog. They may have underlying conditions that haven‚Äôt presented yet. If you are doing any kind of mobility work, you absolutely need to do a full orthopedic workup. That‚Äôs very expensive, but it‚Äôs for the safety of the dog. It doesn‚Äôt matter what sort of care they‚Äôve had at the shelter/rescue, you should take your dog to the vet as soon as possible to be checked.

Most shelters/rescues will also spay/neuter their dogs prior to releasing them, including dogs under 6 months old. This means that (age dependent) the dog you‚Äôre getting has been fixed way too early in their life, [which can cause issues with behaviour and health problems later in life.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7359819/)

Shelters/rescues can guess the relative age of a dog, but it‚Äôs not uncommon for a dog to be older than they realized initially, which means a shorter working life. It may seem nice to skip the puppy phase, but it also means you‚Äôve skipped key socialization windows. If the dog hasn‚Äôt been exposed to the things you‚Äôd need them to be, socialization is going to need a lot more work and will potentially take longer, with a smaller chance of success. 

Similarly, shelters cannot make guarantees as to what the breed is. They can certainly make educated guesses. Many shelter dogs are mutts, which have unknown temperaments that could be the worst of both/all breeds in their genetics. 

Shelter dogs also have some common behavioural concerns: resource guarding, fearful behaviours, separation anxiety, and aggressive behaviours. These behaviours may not be apparent or fully realized until the dog has [settled into their home after a number of months.]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10431636/)

Some shelter/rescue dogs have been abused or neglected. On top of that, being in a shelter is inherently traumatic, even for stable dogs. These dogs can be so over-threshold and/or shut down that you won‚Äôt be able to get any read on their actual personality. Prevailing opinion is that a shelter/rescue dog will not begin to show their true personality until 3 months (or longer) after adoption. This means a sizeable time investment to truly see whether the dog will be suitable for service work. These dogs will need additional training (which means additional money) to address these issues.

Admittedly, dogs who have spent time in foster care directly before coming to you will likely have progressed past the worst of their trauma. They are (ideally) in foster homes who have experience working with these types of dogs. You will have additional information about their potential temperament and their quirks and behavioural concerns. This doesn‚Äôt negate all risk, but it definitely lowers it.

The next bits are the most sensitive parts.

The reason that some people adopt a rescue is to give the dog another chance at life and happiness. That is sincerely a noble goal. However, it‚Äôs not an appropriate reason to seek one out to train as a service dog. We need to put ourselves first in this journey, when picking out the right dog for service work. Your desire to love and support a dog who needs a second chance cannot take priority over the needs of your medical condition. 

You have to consider the scenario of the dog washing. Your noble goal runs directly counter to what is best for your health. Would you be able to take on a second dog, and keep this as a pet? Would the shelter/rescue pet even be able to handle not being the center of your world anymore? Are you willing to rehome the dog? It‚Äôs a dangerous path to be on that puts your health on the line. As stated above, if you are truly serious about having a service dog, you need to be willing to make the hardest decisions for your own benefit. You need to make sure you‚Äôre not putting too much pressure on yourself to keep the dog.

So overall it may seem like you are saving time and money by getting a shelter/rescue dog. In the long run, you are not likely saving anything. While it‚Äôs possible, it‚Äôs incredibly unlikely that this path will work out. It‚Äôs a massive gamble that involves so many potential complications, along with the difficulty of assessing dogs and trying to find your Unicorn dog. You truly need to consider whether it‚Äôs worth all the risk and work.

‚ÄúStarted‚Äù dogs often face all of these same issues.

##Training your current pet dog to be a service dog

This is also a question we see from time to time, and it‚Äôs a very valid one. Some owners experience difficulties in life where they find it more difficult as time goes by to truly thrive. They begin looking into service dogs and are daunted by all the complications in finding the right dog for them (this guide is a perfect show of that fact!) So, wouldn‚Äôt it just be easier to use their existing dog as a service dog?

Maybe, yes! Finally some good news.

Some pet dogs have already developed natural responses to things like heart rate, blood sugar, migraines, seizures, fainting. Some pet dogs have wonderful temperament and great public manners. These types of dogs could be good candidates, at the very least for at-home work.

But if you need a dog for public access, the most important thing to do is consult with a professional trainer. Form a relationship with your trainer, you will need it in case issues arise. You may think that your well behaved dog is perfect for public access, but trainers (ideally) have enough experience to spot things that novice owner trainers can‚Äôt. They can help find out how bomb proof they are. How reactive they are. But further than that - they are your best resource for when things go wrong. We love providing advice on reddit, but we never have the full picture, and only know what you‚Äôre writing to us (which is rarely the full context). Your dog may be attacked, may develop anxieties, any number of things. If you come to reddit asking what to do when that happens, everybody will tell you to consult your professional trainer. There‚Äôs no getting around it, the wash risk is not worth making mistakes at a critical period.

If you need public access and your dog is reactive, that is a sign they may not cut it. You will need to invest a lot of time, effort, and money (with your professional trainer) to see if the reactivity can be resolved. Friendly reactivity is much easier to get under control. But fear and aggression responses are an indication that you may need to go with a different dog.

Age is another key factor in determining whether you should put effort into training your pet to be a service dog. If your dog is still young and biddable, that‚Äôs great. But if your dog is already 7+ years old, by the time you truly finish off their training they‚Äôll be ready for retirement.

Using your own pet dog is where breed becomes less of a factor, if you‚Äôve been together for a long time. You know and understand them, and how to handle and train them. You have that pre-existing bond. That bond is incredibly important, you will know and understand each other and how to work together. The evaluation with your professional trainer still ensures that they have the right temperament and manners for public access work. To be clear: breed is still a factor, genetic dispositions are still a factor. But the amount of time you have worked with your specific dog starts to change the equation.

----------------

##Bringing it all together: how important are breed and origin of a dog, really?

This entire guide was written entirely to help you understand different risk factors on what will directly contribute to the success of your service dog. I cannot overstate enough that breed and origin have a large impact on the long term success of a service dog.

An important note that hasn‚Äôt been addressed yet is the true wash rates on dogs of any type. Reputable programs have a minimum 50% wash rate on their purpose-bred Labrador and Golden Retrievers. The wash rates on off breeds from disadvantaged origins is much higher.

Within our communities online and in-person, it‚Äôs easy to find success stories of any breed or origin. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the journey of the handler has been easy. People aren‚Äôt always open with their struggles. Owner trainers also often have far lower standards in comparison to programs, for good or ill. The people we see in our communities are the ones who are putting in effort into the journey of having a service dog. It‚Äôs important to recognize that not all handlers are in these communities though. There are handlers struggling out there alone because they don‚Äôt think to find these sorts of communities and resources. So we inherently see many good stories, and rarely the bad ones.

I recognize that there are disabled individuals who are of limited means (or suffer from degenerative conditions) and don‚Äôt feel they are able to wait to start their service dog journey. It was discussed heavily above what it takes to make a disadvantaged dog succeed. Experts will always discourage rescues, but I hope you did take the time to watch the DOGGY-U video regarding rescues to help set expectations on the work you will need to put in to offset the risks of the cheaper routes.

There are many different paths you can take on your journey to obtain a service dog. We‚Äôve talked about a lot of different factors that go into this decision. There are valid reasons for getting dogs of different sizes, and other valid medical reasons for selecting a specific breed (though they nearly always have candidates within suitable breeds). I have tried to remain unbiased, but also to make it clear that most of these paths can be extremely difficult, especially for your first service dog. Weighing the risk and work required to get your off-breed or rescue Unicorn can be borderline prohibitive. Not putting in the work to get your unicorn and just taking on the risk is dangerous for you, the dog, and your health.

Labradors are the best choice you can make, hands down. You can get them in different sizes, colours, and energy levels. But that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean they will succeed.

The most important factors in this journey will be your willingness and ability to learn and adapt to your chosen breed. Some breeds take more work than others, and that extra work needed can be tough since we as handlers, are disabled. Dogs from disadvantaged origins will take more time and work. The other most important thing in this journey is.. You need to be willing to wash a dog, and take the journey all over again.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

WOW, holy smokes that was a lot. If you actually got all the way through this, thank you. I ended up putting in much more time and effort into this than originally anticipated. I really do again want to thank the contributors, because it would have a been a much lesser guide without their input.

This is my love letter to the community; I appreciate what the service dog community has given me and I wanted to give back in the ways I know how. Even just through the journey of writing this piece, I have come a long way on opening myself to new ideas and options when it comes to service dogs. I hope through reading this, that you all have as well.

I cracked.¬†

As my relationship¬†with B continued, things at home continued to decline. Whereas I felt alive in threads and GIFs shared between B and I inside¬†our message app, I felt numb and detached when I was at home.

I began to remove myself emotionally from my marriage. My husband noticed 2 weeks before our trip to Spain that something was off. Sex, which was at least always enjoyed on Saturday afternoons, like boring clockwork, became something I now¬†declined. Our morning coffees together were now met in silence as I spent that time instead thinking about what B might be up to. On top of this, I started to feel resentment at my husband. Why is it so hard to love me?¬†It was another weekend afternoon. I declined sex again. My husband told me he didn't want to go to Spain. He told me it would not be a good time, that if we continued like this that it would be a waste of a vacation. I looked at him, and in a moment of anger shared that I wanted to have sex with other people. I told him he doesn't make me feel loved, desired, wanted --- that I didn't want a roommate that fucked me at 10AM every Saturday. That I wanted someone to finally look at me.¬†He agreed. He told me to go ahead and explore myself and ""come home and find out that you love me and want to be with me."" My anger was palpable. How dare he put this on soley me? Like I haven't been begging for him to love me all these years. And now I get the gift of consent to fuck random men in a foreign country. What I wanted was to feel loved. I wanted B.¬†

That's when I asked B to come meet me in¬†Spain. In my mind, I finally had a space to release this energy that's been eating at me throughout all these years. B said yes.¬†He told me he loved me the moment he arrived. My dress ripped apart as he tried taking it off. I told him we should take it slow but he was inside me by the end of the night. We spent the rest of the trip giggling, fucking, holding hands, fucking, making out, fucking, and getting higher and higher on eachother.¬†He told me he had never felt happier than in these moments. He called me his soul mate. By the end of the trip we picked out a house, planned to get a big dumb dog with bad knees,¬†*named our future daughter*, and mused about the life we could still have if we just believed in each other. He promised he could make me happy and that he would spend the rest of his life making up for all the stupid mistakes he made when we were younger. I had never felt so in love.¬†

It was 10 days of what felt like an addict going on bender. My brain was flooded with chemicals day after day. I told him that while I was insanely and ecstatically happy that I was also not sure if it was sustainable. I told him about limerence and that I worried that this would fizzle once the infatuation stage ended. He told me that this is just love. Like it was so simple.¬†But as the end of the trip drew closer, B got more restless. He told me he worried that he would never see me again after this trip -- that he was afraid that he would just be a stop over in my life. We ended up talking about the practicality of it all. How IDK if I'm ready to give up a life I built with my husband. I am afraid to give into chemicals that will fade away once we are comfortable¬†with each other. I am afraid to throw my life away because I am addicted to someone.¬†

I saw my husband 1 week after I arrived home from my trip. He ended up in Europe as well -- a work conference in Amsterdam. We talked about our experiences away. I told him about B. All of it. My husband told me all of it too -- like how he had hired prostitutes throughout his¬†trip. But as he talked, he broke down and cried. He told me he seeked out women that looked like me. That he doesn't want anyone else. That he missed me and that he was sorry he let it come to this. My husband and I made love in a way we never had throughout the entirety of our relationship. I felt connected with him again. WTF is wrong with me?¬†

My husband agreed to let me see B one last time.

B met me here, in my city, while my husband was away on another business trip. It was the same kind of high it was in Spain. And while I started that one last weekend with B thinking it would be the end of us, I left being convinced, yet again, that maybe this is love after all and I'm being stupid for not following it. Those final moments were so tender between us, and I cannot bear to let them go.¬†Even in his sleep, I would hear him mumble about me. He whispered in my ear, my name, and said ""will I not see you in 80 years...?"" It was gibberish but it was grief. He told me the next day that while there will be other women in his life after us, that he will be there waiting for me. He told me he just wants to love me forever. I told him not to wait for me. That I can't promise him that I will know, or ever know, what I want. And that I don't want him to suffer because of it.

I moved out 4 weeks later. I told my husband I need space to process everything that happened over the summer. I told him I was in love with someone else. He supported my decision so long as we don't see each other¬†during this time. It is an active exercise of self control every day not to reach out to B. I miss him so much. But I refuse to let my actions hurt him and my husband any longer.¬†I cannot reach out to him until I separate from my husband, even if that means he does move on before then. Seeing him at this moment would just make things worse.

But as I write this, I still don't know if I'm strong enough to keep away.¬†Every day is a struggle. You'll probably hear from me again, here, on this forum, not too far from now after some bad choice I'll end up making in the upcoming weeks. Till then...",5,1730149235.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve looked at hardware solutions like the Trimble TDC100 for data capture and considered software options like Forms on Fire, Fulcrum App, and GoCanvas, but need guidance on finding the best fit. The hardware must be durable for wet conditions and have a simple, user-friendly interface suitable for employees with limited computer experience.

**Examples of Challenges:**

1. **Data Entry Bottleneck**: Manual recording and transcription are slow and error-prone.
2. **Software Limitations**: Google Forms lacked the customization and efficiency needed, and we are evaluating other software solutions like Forms on Fire, Fulcrum, and GoCanvas.
3. **Hardware Requirements**: Wet processing conditions require robust devices (like the Trimble TDC100) with simple interfaces.",0,1730148708.0,instrumentation,1,0.5,False
1gecu3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1gecu3u/tw_questioning_host_sexuality_its_bringing_up/,Tw: Questioning host sexuality & it's bringing up past Lbgtq+ trauma when reflecting ,"So, I understand currently I'm not the core host. He's demisexual since like the age of 15, yet *before* that had ever come into play around the age of 11-13. I was fronting with my system brothers (OG's) and we've all been collectively queer parts of our host since the beginning, I feel. 

For example: I'm a nonbinary lesbian, my middle brother is bisexual and relationship/neurodivergent wise prefers aromance, my second eldest brother is *highly* bisexual too, yet in the end was married to another of our male alters. Then my youngest brother was genderfliud (now trans) and specifically has a T4T preference (he's married to one of our intersex alters) and then our eldest brother found he was gay and is a *huge* lover for bear guys specifically. 

Like, big, hairy, muscular, and tall fiercely loving men that could make him fold with the natural dominant approach/nature. (You guessed it, he's engaged) Yet, I'm not into any type of men, frankly I'm repulsed and traumatized by some (obviously)

Aside from them. I'm firm on my type of woman and I know I love big curvy, inspiringly creative, spunky girls. Like adventurous and expressive artists, like them strong and independent, but melts in my arms and cuddles up to me with such love after a long day. The kind girls that love to stop at the coffee shop for a cute coffee date, take pictures, draw a little (maybe watch me draw) and continue it during a walk in the park and sharing earbuds while listening to like super gushy, gay music. Like truthfully, I am *so* unattracted to men, I *know* I'm into woman only and ironically I very recently had a reflection about our past middle school ex-gf, who I vividly recall dating and came to the realization I might not be the only one feeling this like yearning?

Long story short, my host has been through a lot. He's been newly split off since 2021 and went through something traumatic involving being a victim of queer fetishizing by an ex-friend. Needless to say she caught him in a very vulnerable time during a toxic breakup and played the best friend to support him, yet she in reality was cornering him into dating down the road, even though he already rejected her more than once through the course of the year.

Yet that was a year ago, he's been through it with another (ex-bf this time). That was more than 6 months ago now and frankly he says because of the neglect he faced in the 4 months, it was childish nonetheless and he wasn't going to be fed into his ex games who was trying to get a reaction. So, with support of work and his friend group he said he was fine and will heal. So, now he's just been trying to heal on his own while dating himself to understand himself more and even understand us, his system.

Overall, he really doesn't want to be stuck in such a mental funk all because he moved back home/and is dealing with a ""mild"" breakup and has been trying to reconnect with our old group that ex- friend cut him off from last year and it's been great. So great he recently met and started talking to another guy friend (green flag) in the Friend group, during a gaming con and hit it off. 

Yet, he seemed to go back and forth with not only gay content creators and their ""how to date a woman"" dating advice or ""how to romantically connect with a woman"" and I'm not stereotyping, but he's been listening to Chappell Roan *a lot* and gets very emotional and even swooned over her lyrics and one thing we *all* know about him is he listens deeply to lyrics and loves each and every songs meaning on his playlist.  

Also, I haven't been here in a hot minute and whenever I'm fronting I feel this burning desire to be as gay as I want and to be such a massive stud (because I am one ü´†)

I don't know if this is just me, like when fronting? Or when he's fronting he seems to have this longing feeling. I honestly don't know if it's because the ex-friend really skewed his perspective of dating a lesbian woman or because he's really questioning if he wants a girlfriend, because clicking with a woman is so much more fluent for him rather than a man. The only issue that stumps him is he's GNC and he's taking T. So, in his head he feels he doesn't qualify to date a woman and thus possibly why we have men alters (plus trauma), like too many because of this fear of not being man enough to date a girl? Along with trauma, which I understand. Just even talking to them though. It kind of shows some have inner homophobia or even toxic masculinity about themselves..

 I don't know, I'm worried about him overall and was hoping to find some brainstorming or advice on this puzzling matter. Since he came forward to me about it since I'm into woman, like he's questioning.

Any queer systems are welcomed to answer even allies! No hate please, I just am trying to help my host understand himself more, thanks!- V.üé®",1,1730148663.0,DID,1,1.0,False

1gecqgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gecqgk/its_been_a_long_time_coming_for_me_20m/,It's been a long time coming for me (20m),"From a young age I was taught to believe in the teachings of the church. I was baptized at 8, and was told that I would feel different afterwards because it was the spirit being with me but really it was because I felt like part of an in-group. Unfortunately, that wouldn't last for long.

I guess I would say that I have always been a reluctant believer, and honestly if I had never been born into the church then I would have never joined by my own free will. Even as a kid I had many 'wait a second' moments that I brushed aside because I was naive and I trusted my parents and leaders. Things like: ""We don't worship Joseph Smith or any prophets"" (but I noticed the borderline creepy reverence for the GAs), or that I never really felt that the BoM was true so I gaslit myself into believing that it was, etc.

This sense of wrongness grew as I got older and began to think for myself. I have always disagreed with the church on political and moral issues. When they began to teach us in seminary about ""blacks and the priesthood"" and some church history stuff that was pretty deep--I had a seminary teacher who thought he could vaccinate us against anti-Mormon truths--instead of thinking that it was ""God's revelation"" to finally give non-white people membership privileges I recognized that it was just that church leaders were fucking racist.

I also struggled for years to feel like I belonged, but now I realize that it was because I just never fit the church. I was pretty appalled at members during the trump years, and it only got worse when the pandemic hit because I lost my shitty Mormon friends who didn't like me because I didn't sing their tune, and I became very depressed. 

I was probably actively PIMO by my senior year of high school, and I finally befriended some people who cared about me (a bunch of queers, who knew they could be more authentic). It all came crashing to a head when I realized that I had been suppressing my bisexuality my whole life. Suddenly not only did I hate going to church or activities because I recognized the fakeness of it all, but I dreaded it because I didn't want to out myself to such a hateful group of people. I refused to go on a mission at this time. I began to scour the general handbook for any leeway concerning my sexuality, but it didn't help and I just stopped attending.

I guess I still held out some hope that the gospel was true or some bullshit until last summer, when I had some heavily encouraged reintroduction to the church by my 80yo bishop grandpa that brought back those same feelings. I then had a heated argument with him about politics, where he called me satanic for being a Marxist and told me that he joined the church ""because it was a church that taught that anyone is allowed to do whatever they want"". I was so disgusted after a long summer of him saying racist and merciless things about minorities and poor people that I rejected this whole piece of shit religion right then and there.

I don't know why I didn't do it sooner honestly. I have had a bad taste in my mouth but now I'm just vomiting it all up: a crippled sexuality because of strict chastity rules; a sense of shame and profound self-hatred for myself because of thought policing; underdeveloped social skills because of the way the church fosters vapid relationships; a poor idea of how to be a man because of a lack of good male role-models.

My only saving grace outside of my very supportive friends has been my parents, who are open minded if a little ignorant. Even so, I am still pissed at the way they raised me in the gospel. My hypocrite father trapped me in a car and extracted detailed information about my pornography use in the name of ""helping me"" (a lonely boy with repressed sexuality used porn, surprise!). My parents discouraged me from forming friendships outside of the church and I could only date in a limited fashion after 16. I still have issues with dating and intimacy in all forms because of this.

I feel like my childhood has been stolen me and I have been given a rotten hand for adulthood. I am so fucking pissed some days because the church has held me back. I am also very glad to be done with it because I get to enjoy delicious black coffee and swear like I always wanted to and enjoy alcohol and figure out how to be myself before it became more difficult to find that real me.",5,1730148409.0,exmormon,6,1.0,False

All I do is go to work, go home and watch tv and it‚Äôs an endless cycle other than the odd coffee with my boyfriend once or twice a week but it all seems repetitive and I‚Äôm not too sure how to change my lifestyle.

I‚Äôm also a person who doesn‚Äôt like to try new things, however I know I need a hobby but also at the same time I‚Äôm not motivated and I can‚Äôt find something that I enjoy to want to even bother trying it. (I‚Äôm trying to get myself out of this cycle) I literally don‚Äôt know how to just push myself to do something.

The rest of my family (mostly grandma and aunt) can be infuriating though, just today my aunt brought up the topic after i told her i didnt finish my lunch as i had accidentally served too much and i couldnt eat all of it (I DIDNT EVEN EAT THAT MUCH MIND YOU) which kinda pissed me off especially after she asked if i had finally stopped drinking iced coffees every day, i used to drink 1 a day but ive toned it down, she just expects me to stop entirely even though im a college student with SEVERE adhd and coffee is a great substitute for meds and im a huge sweet tooth so ADD THAT PUMPKIN SPICE SLAYYYY, ahem anyways, after that interaction i just completely shut up, i had bought a cheesecake slice to share with her and mom but womp womp no cheesecake for her ig, anyways my dumbass mind spiraled as it always does (lord help me) and now i cant stop thinking on the comments i keep getting from her and grandma, and it made me kinda have a mental breakdown? and now my mind is telling me to just not eat what i like, eat very small portions of food, and just survive on water and pure pettiness ig? And i know thats not healthy but i dont see any other way of either getting them to stop cuz they got what they wanted or they realize they fucked up the moment i fucking collapse, either way i just want them to stop, i was having a good day before she fucked it up. So yeah now im just gonna starve until they leave me the fuck alone or i die idfk.

Everything was going great, I was loving my job, making friends, getting into a routine, got a whole bunch of healthy lifestyle changes to stick. We were finally financially stable after a rough year. 

Then completely of the blue, with no warning whatsoever, I got the familiar feeling that I was moving through mud and needed like three extra cups of coffee, but when I had more caffeine it wouldn‚Äôt do anything. Even when I was able to sleep full nights.  Completely exhausted. 

I was able to force myself to go to a concert I was looking forward to for months, even though my brain was telling me to stay home and feel sorry for myself. It helped a little bit. 

Then a torrential downpour soaked my computer through. I had booked a tattoo so I spent all of my extra money for the month already. My anxiety is through the fucking roof. After all of those years of work all my coping skills are completely gone. I was about ready to stop therapy, and now I can barely feed myself and am back to panic attacks, shaking, crying at everything, constantly worrying nonstop, unable to have any downtime relaxing whatsoever, only able to stare at my phone and worry. 

I had to call my parents (i‚Äôm almost 24. i‚Äôm not a kid anymore.) and get mommy and daddy to fix it. If I didn‚Äôt have my parents, I would be completely fucked and wouldn‚Äôt be able to work (my job needs a personal computer). I feel like such a failure and a burden to my family and wish I wasn‚Äôt so stupid. I should be further than I am. 

Computers are only a few hundred. I have parents who are in a position to and don‚Äôt mind helping. If I need to, I can put one on a payment plan for the next few months. There‚Äôs like so many logical inconsistencies with this anxiety. But I can‚Äôt see past it. And I feel like I‚Äôm just going to be stuck in this loop for all eternity and feel like shit for the rest of my life. What do I even do?

1gechmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gechmm/aita_for_contacting_my_dad/,AITA for contacting my dad?,"
For context, my mom (40f) and dad (72m) separated when I (18f) was around one year old. The story I was told by my mother is that she found my father cheating on her, so she ran away with me.

She said my father didn‚Äôt feed her while they were together; he was very stingy. He would budget a single can of sardines to last for a day‚Äôs meal. While she was pregnant with me, he made her work, and all her salary went to him. She told me a lot more, but that‚Äôs all I can remember right now.

My dad hasn‚Äôt provided any support for me, and I‚Äôve never seen him since I was a child. A few years ago, he contacted me. We chatted sometimes, but I didn‚Äôt really enjoy replying to him because of what he did. And he doesn‚Äôt like it when we chat; he insists we call because he thinks my mom might be the one chatting with him instead of me. He bad-mouths my mom, saying she brainwashed me and that she‚Äôs lying to me. Then last year, I finally stopped replying to him because my mom told me to. I never listened to his side.

So yesterday, after a huge fight with my mom, I messaged my dad. I asked for his side of the story, and today we had a call.

It turns out that, according to him, my mom was the one who cheated on him with several guys whenever my dad was abroad for work. While they were still together, she supposedly worked as a prostitute or something, being paid for sex. She would even tell my dad about these guys, saying they were really good in bed.

He said my mom was already a drug addict even before they met, and that he‚Äôs the reason she stopped because he was very against it. Then, after I was born, their relationship became complicated because my mom would always leave to meet up with other guys or do drugs. Every time she ran away, my dad would give her money whenever she asked for it.

He said my mom has hated me ever since I was a child (this is true up to now). She would always say she didn‚Äôt like me because I was ugly (I‚Äôm actually quite pretty, lol), annoying, and that I ruined her life. He said my mom didn‚Äôt cook food at home, only cooked rice, and boiled water for coffee. My dad, on the other hand, would always try to make food. Apparently, I was always crying back then because my mom wouldn‚Äôt feed me, and my dad would try to cook potatoes for me since he didn‚Äôt know how to cook rice, but I didn‚Äôt like potatoes. So he would often ask the neighbors for rice.

He said my mom was very lazy, didn‚Äôt do laundry, didn‚Äôt cook, nothing. People even called my dad ""the battered husband"" because my mom was always angry at him. Every time they were about to separate, my mom would threaten him with something‚ÄîI forgot what exactly‚Äîbut she would always demand money.

After they separated, my mom ran away and took me with her so she could get money from my dad. He gave her money, but he never got to see me. My mom even filed a case against him and spoke with a lawyer about dropping the case if he paid her 150,000 pesos. My dad agreed because he was a foreigner and had no standing here in the Philippines. When the day to pay came, my mom didn‚Äôt sign to drop the case and demanded even more money, which I think my dad gave, and we haven‚Äôt seen each other since.

After a few years or months, they reached an agreement where my dad would provide support for me. At that time, he didn‚Äôt have a job anymore, only a small pension because something related to unpaid SSS due to my mom. My dad offered 50 euros as support, but my mom responded, ‚ÄúEat that money yourself. It‚Äôs not even enough for my makeup.‚Äù

So yeah, he told me more, but I‚Äôve forgotten, and I‚Äôm tired of typing. So, was I wrong to contact my dad and go against my mom‚Äôs wishes? And is it wrong that I believe my dad more because almost everything he said matches what I‚Äôve experienced with my mom?",1,1730147805.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

1gec86k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1gec86k/tifu/,TIFU,"So this actually happened in May. I had recently left a long term relationship and decided it was time to get back out there. I (31F) downloaded Hinge and matched with a guy (33M) that was very good looking and we hit it off. After a few weeks, I agreed to go on a date with him. We agreed to meet up for a casual coffee date and a walk in the park. 
So it is time for the date and I show up on time but he is 15 minutes late, I let it go. Of course it‚Äôs awkward meeting someone and I had been out of the game for seven years so I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was expecting. Anyways, he gets out of the car, comes up to me and opens his arm for a hug, and I reciprocate. He then immediately goes in for a kiss with an EXCESSIVE amount of tongue. It caught me off guard, but he was really good looking so I let it go. Anyways, we go into the establishment and it‚Äôs a Mom and Pop coffee shop. We get inside, place our order and it is time to pay, but he just walks away with the drinks. I said out loud ‚ÄúI guess I will pay for them‚Äù, he responded with ‚Äúoh if you don‚Äôt mind‚Äù. I would like to note, I have absolutely no problem paying it just again threw me off because it was never discussed just assumed. Again,I let it go. We sit down and start having pretty decent conversation, but he is making very intense eye contact, which made me a little uncomfortable but not enough to throw any major flags. So it is wrapping up and it is time to go to the park. Like a dumbass, I agree to get into the car with a stranger an allow him to drive us there instead of following behind. So we are driving along and he is going the wrong direction to the park. I asked where we were going and he tells me he wanted to take me a mountain lookout. But the specific location he mentioned is known as a place nothing good happens. I veto that. He then tells me he wants me to meet his mother. I say no to that as well. This man pulls up to his mom‚Äôs house. I told him in not comfortable with this. He tries to reassure me by mentioning it‚Äôs really his close his mom just lives with him. At this point, the red flags finally start to make an appearance. I told him that we had agreed to a walk in the park. He reluctantly agreed and headed to the park. He was also swerving all over the road andI swear he fell asleep at least once if not twice. I wanted to just dip out, but I didn‚Äôt have my car so I had to ride it out. I convinced him to let me swing by to get my car so it wouldn‚Äôt be a hassle later. I should have bailed right then. But nooooo, me being a dumbass, I still follow him to the park. So we start walking and this man pulls his shirt off ave leaves it off for the remainder of the date. Keep in mind d it‚Äôs a public park with kids and old people. He wants us to sit on a bench to talk. We sit down. Yall, this man starts to pray, LOUD af. About how grateful he was that I was put into his life and how much he LOVES me and that I‚Äôm his girlfriend. People are walking past us just making eye contact with me as I mouth the words, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù. It was so awkward. I should probably mention this guy is like 6‚Äô4‚Äù at like 250+lbs. big enough that I knew I couldn‚Äôt take him if I ran. At this point, I was just trying to hurry it along so I could go home. We start walking again and he tries to lead me to the edges of the park. The crowd is no longer granny‚Äôs and little kids. I‚Äôm stepping over needles and around homeless people. There are a bunch of abandoned buildings nearby. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been in these buildings at night, wanna check em out with me?‚Äù I said,  ‚ÄúNO, I think my mom is calling I need to go home. Thankfully he didn‚Äôt push it too far. So he walks me back to my car and as I try to slide in, as I‚Äôm swinging my feet under the dash he grabs my left foot (wearing flip flops) and proceeds to put his mouth on my toes. Yall, the gasp I gasped! He notices, let‚Äôs go and says, ‚Äúhang on‚Äù. He is parallel parked in front of me so I can‚Äôt just leave. He digs in his truck for a while and comes back with a jacket. He throws it through my driver window all the way to the back of my SUV. Looks me dead in the eyes, serious af, and says, ‚Äújust so you know, I‚Äôm very possessive of my belongings, and you are not girlfriend now‚Äù. I just looked back and said ok cool. I took tf off. Something didn‚Äôt feel right, so I pull over a few blocks over and grab the jacket. I look in the pocket and there is an Apple Air Tag inside. I threw it in the dumpster at in the parking lot and took the longest way home I could. 

Dates over, I‚Äôm alive! I call my bff and tell her wtf just happened. She was like, ‚ÄúBITCH, did you forget how to google‚Äù. I get home, put my FBI cap on and start looking. Tell me why THREE mugshots pop up, drugs, assault, and domestic violence. I also find him in one of those, ‚Äúare we dating the same guy‚Äù groups. Yall, his exwife and other past partners had all the receipts. This man is crazy af. He is also in school to be an anesthesiologist! The last person I would want around while I‚Äôm unconscious!

# Welcome to your new Mod Free Origins SMP

We are are a Minecraft SMP Origins Server for 1.20-1.21 with custom tailored plugins that promotes a crossplay experience for both java and bedrock players without the need to install any mods. With heavy inspiration from the original Origins mod, we are inspired from the original mod  with additional new twist for the origins such as a Blazeborn's new heat gauge mechanic or Shulk capability to levitate enemies on hit.

We promote a friendly nontoxic environment and focus development to promote player to player interactions to create memorable experiences. We do not allow griefing, stealing, or harassment. We do offer a supporter rank for those wanting to show appreciation but only provide small QOL changes to avoid P2W advantages and to keep the server fair to all.

# Why Play Origins Reborn?

*Processing img w804v9xwyarc1...*

We offer a unique Towny experience via custom plugin integration to encourage both roleplay and teamwork within a low inflation player driven economy. Towns are encouraged to be a center point of activity for both town members and guests with new mechanics such as the Tavern and Market systems.

*Processing img 2743wr0yyarc1...*

Enhance the vanilla experience with the famous Brewery Plugin with over 20 new drinks ranging from brews, coffees, teas, liquid orbs of origin, and more.  New coinvent recipes have been added to allow megabuild  projects to be more obtainable. We plan to continue to add more Quality of life changes over time.

*Processing img ai0w71gyyarc1...*

While PVP is not the primary focus of the server, players may join an optional PVP bounty system. The bounty system allows players to receive bounties and hunt others for monetary reward, but at the risk of losing some yourself.  Opted out players have defenses to discourage unwanted PVP.

*Processing img 80lgf26dxdcd1...*

We strive to have compatibility for as many players as possible. This means anyone can join even without mods, and allow players from Mobile, Console, Bedrock PC, and Java to play. We do not support cracked clients though, so you would need access to a Minecraft account

At least up to the '8' number on my coffee maker's  coffee pot (I disagree that makes 8 actual cups)**  
  
Alright, so there is more to the story - but I did indeed end up in ER this weekend and it's very possible the reason is going cold turkey on coffee. And that is both \*wild\* (and scary) to me.  
  
Basically I got sick last week - and other than being ill enough to not want coffee, wanting to prioritise hydration (and also not wanting to visit the toilet more than I need to), I just didn't stopped drinking coffee.

Within 12 hours of the first day without coffee, I developed a persistant low-grade headache that no meds can seem to prevent. That has stayed with me until today. 

I ended up visiting the ER on Friday, and after a nice 8 hour stay, was eventually sent home with antibiotics and was told 'if you develop a fever, come back to ER'. 

Saturday I'm feeling better, other than the headache, but then Saturday night I have the worst night's sleep - muscles aching, hot and cold, dizzy, groggy etc. I then wake up Sunday morning and sure enough I have a fever of just over 100F. 

Per their instructions I head back to the ER - and after another nice old 5 hours with them, they come back with blood tests and 'say your markers are all down - so the fever isn't related to what you came in for.'

So the question then is - how TF did I get a fever/achey muscles/flu symptoms? They tested me for COVID and tested negative. No one else in my house got sick. Nor had I really seen anyone because the previous 5 days, I'd been at home in bed - and in the ER, I was in my own room.   
  
Possibilities could be food poisoning - I did get Sushi on Sat night - but so did the rest of my family. So then the other thing could be knocking coffee on the head cold turkey. 

I had a black tea on Sunday after returning from the hospital, and it really did make me feel a bit better. Then this morning (Monday, as I'm writing this), I woke from the best night's sleep I've had in 7+ days, and another black tea this morning has left me feeling \~60% of the way to better. 

**TL;DR - most things I search online don't mention an actual fever as a possible side effect - although some do call it out, most just state 'flu symptoms'. Has anyone else experienced symptoms that bad from quitting coffee? Either way the experience has made me revisit my relationship with coffee. I just ordered a bag of decaf beans, because there's no way something I have every day should make me feel like that just from skipping a few days with it.**

I also kinda laughed about the idea of checking into the hospital knowing what I possibly know now:

'Why are you visiting the ER today sir?'

I have a 2 bedroom unit (1,013 square feet) at Village West Appartments on Lindberg road and am looking for 2 people to takeover the lease from me and my roommate for the 2025-2026 year. The apartment is very close to the clubhouse/bus stop and is also locked in at a lower rent than you would have if you went directly through Village West, as they have raised the rent for new people.

rent: $819, utilities: $115, Insurance: $15

It is a total of $949 per person, per month, (including rent, all utilities, and the 15 renters insurance). (You can also get your own different insurance if you want to, but the default option is very economical).

Village West has a clubhouse with study space, printer, free coffee machine, a gym, an outdoor pool during the warm months, and your 35lindberg citybus pass is included as well.

Apartment amenities: The main area is furnished with a stove, oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, kitchen island, kitchen sink, dining table, chairs, 2 coffee tables and many cabinets. The laundry room has a washer and dryer and storage space. The bedrooms have 1 king size bed each, a desk, decent sized closets, a chair, a nightstand, and a dresser. Internet and internal heating and cooling are also included. There is also a decent sized balcony.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a story‚Ä¶‚Äù Jack Straw, twenty-nine, a man on the edge of the universe. The sidewalks of Eugene, Oregon, swirled with a gray mist that clung to him like the ghosts of forgotten mind movies. The rain was a relentless jazz ride cymbal, an unbroken tapping of drips and splashes dancing across the pavement, echoing the rhythm of his restless soul. Jack had long abandoned the need for an umbrella, opting instead for the rain-soaked embrace of his well-worn trench coat, a cliche from another time, another reality. The rain no longer meant weather.

Jack Straw was not your average investigator. No, sir. His badge was more symbolic than tangible, a token of his passage through a realm where the line between the tangible and the intangible was as thin as a whisper. His job, his calling, was to investigate the underbelly of alternate realities, to sift through the melodies of worlds that never were and yet always are. He was a cartographer of the unseen, mapping the contours of existence beyond the known.

He moved through the city's veins, a man out of sync with the monotony of everyday life. His eyes, dark as midnight, bore the weight of a thousand unseen stars. In the warm light of a neon diner, he found a temporary refuge, a sanctuary from the swirling chaos. He slid into a booth, the faux-leather squeaking in protest, and waved the waitress over with a nod.

‚ÄúBlack coffee,‚Äù he muttered, his voice like distant boring thunder. ‚ÄúUp hill, down hill‚Ä¶it's the same hill.‚Äù

She nodded, but her eyes lingered on him, a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. Jack wasn‚Äôt the sort to blend in. His presence was a magnet for the odd, the enigmatic, the inexplicable.

The diner was a throwback of the fifties, a time capsule wrapped in chrome and vinyl. The jukebox in the corner played a steady stream of old blues tunes, each note a reminder of the world Jack had long left behind. He sipped his coffee, its bitter warmth a grounding force against the cool fog of the night.

Jack‚Äôs mind wandered to the case at hand. He had stumbled upon a rift in reality, a fissure in the fabric of existence itself, and it was his job to stitch it back together‚Äîor at least to understand why it was unraveling in the first place. There were rumors, whispers of a new dimension emerging, a shadow realm that flickered at the edge of perception, like the trembling light of a distant star.

In the glare of the diner‚Äôs fluorescent lights, Jack saw the face of a man who wasn‚Äôt there. Not a man from another world, but a man from his own past, long gone, like a photograph fading in the sun. The face was familiar, yet alien, a distortion in the very essence of time. It vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving Jack to question his own sanity‚Äîor perhaps the sanity of the world itself.	

He pulled out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, tapping one out with the practiced ease of a man who had long since resigned himself to the nicotine dance. The smoke curled lazily, a serpentine waltz that mingled with the ambient hum of the diner. Jack took a drag, the sharp burn of the tobacco a welcome distraction from the swirling confusion of his thoughts.

The bell above the diner‚Äôs door jingled, a sharp, clear note in the murky dissonance. Jack‚Äôs gaze shifted to the newcomer, a woman cloaked in a heavy red coat that seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly hue. Her eyes were the color of molten gold, and they locked onto Jack‚Äôs with an intensity that spoke of secrets buried deep, of truths hidden behind layers of illusion.

She approached, her steps as deliberate as the ticking of a clock winding down. Jack felt a shiver run down his spine, a familiar sensation that always accompanied the arrival of someone who was, in some ineffable way, connected to the mysteries he sought to unravel.

‚ÄúJack Straw?‚Äù she asked, her voice a smooth, silken whisper that seemed to cut through the din of the diner.

Jack nodded, his eyes never leaving hers. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù

The woman slid into the booth across from him, her movements graceful and precise. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you. There‚Äôs a reality that needs saving, and it‚Äôs slipping through the cracks faster than you can say ‚Äòalternate dimension.‚Äô‚Äù

Jack raised an eyebrow, the smoke from his cigarette curling lazily between them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù

Her gaze hardened, as if weighing the gravity of her next words. ‚ÄúThey say the fabric of reality is weakening, and it‚Äôs not just one world at stake. It‚Äôs many, all converging and collapsing in on themselves. I need your help to stop it.‚Äù

Jack took another drag of his cigarette, letting the smoke drift upwards as he considered the gravity of her words. ‚ÄúAnd why me? Why not someone else?‚Äù

The woman‚Äôs smile was enigmatic, a secret wrapped in a riddle. ‚ÄúBecause, Jack Straw, you‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs been to the edges and returned. You know the paths between the worlds. You‚Äôve walked them and survived.‚Äù

Jack stared into his coffee, its surface reflecting the dim light of the diner, and felt a sense of inevitability settling over him. The unknown was calling, and he was ready to answer. After all, he had always been a wanderer, a seeker of truths that lay beyond the veil of ordinary existence. And now, it seemed, his journey was about to take a turn into the unknown.

The woman rose, her red coat shimmering as she prepared to leave. ‚ÄúThe rift is growing, and time is running out. Meet me at the old library at midnight. We‚Äôll begin there.‚Äù

With that, she was gone, leaving Jack alone with the remnants of his coffee and the echo of her words. The rain outside continued its relentless pattern, a reminder of the world that was‚Äîand the worlds yet to be discovered.

Jack Straw, investigator of alternate realities, knew that the path ahead would be fraught with danger, mystery, and wonder. But for now, in the quiet sanctuary of the diner, he allowed himself a brief moment of calm before stepping once more into the swirling chaos of the infinite.



\*\*\*

Jack‚Äôs mind was still buzzing from the enigmatic woman‚Äôs visit earlier that evening. She had left him with an itch for something deeper, something beyond the rational. He needed a way to crack open the boundaries of his perception, to navigate the narrow, treacherous corridors of alternate realities. He had come across an old, dusty bottle of mushrooms during a half-hearted rummage through a forgotten cabinet earlier that week. The label on the bottle was yellowed and faded.

He sat on the edge of his bed, staring at the bottle as if it might suddenly reveal its truths. There was a sense of grim determination in his eyes, the kind that comes from facing down the inexplicable with nothing more than a flickering sense of curiosity. He poured a handful of the dried, twisted fungi into his palm, inspecting them with the careful scrutiny of a man who had seen too much to be easily impressed.

Swallowing his skepticism, he tossed the mushrooms into his mouth and washed them down with a swig of cheap bourbon. The taste was earthy, almost bitter, like something you‚Äôd expect to find in a forgotten corner of an ancient library. Jack leaned back against the headboard, lit a cigarette, and waited for the inevitable onset of whatever reality-altering experience awaited him.

As the effects began to creep in, the room started to warp around him. The walls seemed to breathe, undulating with a slow, rhythmic pulse, and the shadows began to stretch and twist into grotesque shapes. The neon sign outside his window, advertising a dingy bar on the corner, flickered erratically, casting strange, shifting patterns on the walls. The boundaries of reality were softening, and Jack felt himself slipping into a realm where logic was a distant memory.

Then came the knock on the door‚Äîa sharp, decisive rap that cut through the haze of Jack‚Äôs altered perception. He staggered to his feet, the room spinning around him like a carnival ride. When he opened the door, he was met by a figure who looked as if he had stepped straight out of a fever dream.

The man stood there in a long, flowing robe of emerald green, adorned with golden runes that seemed to shimmer and shift with each movement. His hat was a tall, conical affair, tipped jauntily to one side. The face beneath was lined with age, but there was a spark in his eyes that suggested he had seen things most people couldn‚Äôt even begin to comprehend.

‚ÄúJack Straw?‚Äù The voice was deep and resonant, carrying an undertone of ancient wisdom and endless mischief.

Jack blinked, trying to bring the figure into focus. ‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù

The man gave a theatrical bow, his robe swirling around him like a living entity. ‚ÄúI am Wizard Lifecoat, and I‚Äôve come to guide you through the treacherous paths of the mind and the cosmos. May I come in?‚Äù

Jack didn‚Äôt have the presence of mind to refuse. He stepped aside, and Wizard Lifecoat swept into the room with an air of someone who was completely unfazed by the disarray. The room, already a collage of shifting colors and impossible angles, seemed to bend itself even further around the wizard‚Äôs presence, as though the very fabric of reality was accommodating his whims.

‚ÄúNice place you‚Äôve got here,‚Äù Lifecoat said, surveying the clutter with a wry smile. ‚ÄúA little lived-in, wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, I‚Äôve been a little busy trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe,‚Äù Jack retorted, though his words seemed to slur and bend in the air. ‚ÄúWhat brings you to my humble abode?‚Äù

Wizard Lifecoat settled into an armchair with an exaggerated flourish, his robe trailing behind him like a wake. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about to embark on a journey, Jack. A journey into realms that defy the laws of physics and logic. And if you‚Äôre going to do that, you might as well have a guide who knows the ropes.‚Äù

Jack rubbed his eyes, trying to clear the fog from his vision. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember asking for a guide.‚Äù

Lifecoat chuckled, a sound like the rustling of ancient scrolls. ‚ÄúNo, but the universe has a way of sending us what we need, whether we ask for it or not. And besides, you look like you could use a little help.‚Äù

The wizard‚Äôs eyes gleamed with a mischievous light. ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs get down to business. The paths you‚Äôre about to traverse are filled with peril and wonder. We‚Äôll start with the basics: the art of perception.‚Äù

With a snap of his fingers, Lifecoat conjured a small, glowing orb that floated lazily above the table. It pulsed with a gentle light, casting an ethereal glow across the room. ‚ÄúThis is a simple tool to help you see beyond the veil of your current reality.‚Äù

Jack stared at the orb, its light reflecting in his eyes like a distant star. The room seemed to stretch and contract with each pulse, and he felt as if he were being drawn into its depths. ‚ÄúWhat do I do with it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSimply observe,‚Äù Lifecoat said. ‚ÄúLet your mind wander, let it drift into the spaces between the known and the unknown. Allow yourself to become part of the tapestry of existence.‚Äù

Jack reached out tentatively, his fingers brushing against the orb‚Äôs surface. As soon as he made contact, a jolt of energy surged through him, and the room exploded into a riot of colors and patterns. He was no longer in his apartment but rather floating in a boundless expanse of shifting light and sound.

The experience was both exhilarating and disorienting. The boundaries of his perception were stretched beyond the ordinary, revealing glimpses of landscapes and beings that defied all logic. He saw worlds colliding, timelines intersecting, and reality itself folding in on itself like a cosmic origami. In the midst of it all, Wizard Lifecoat floated beside him, his calm demeanor a stark contrast to the chaotic beauty of the scene.

‚ÄúThis is the realm of possibilities,‚Äù Lifecoat‚Äôs voice echoed through the vastness. ‚ÄúEvery choice you make creates a new thread in the tapestry of existence. You must learn to navigate these threads with both caution and curiosity.‚Äù

Jack felt a surge of understanding, a profound clarity that was as fleeting as it was powerful. He saw how the universe was a complex web of interconnections, where each action reverberated through countless realities. It was both overwhelming and awe-inspiring, a reminder of the vastness of what lay beyond the veil of the ordinary.

As the vision began to recede, Jack found himself back in his apartment, the room gradually coming back into focus. Wizard Lifecoat was still there, his smile more knowing than before.

‚ÄúHow was that?‚Äù Lifecoat asked, his eyes twinkling with satisfaction.

‚ÄúIntense,‚Äù Jack replied, struggling to find the right words. ‚ÄúLike seeing the universe in a whole new way.‚Äù

Lifecoat‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúGood. Remember, Jack, perception is the key to understanding. With it, you can navigate the complexities of existence and uncover the truths that lie hidden.‚Äù

As the wizard prepared to take his leave, he placed a hand on Jack‚Äôs shoulder, his touch light but firm. ‚ÄúThe journey ahead will be fraught with challenges. Keep your wits about you and your mind open. We‚Äôll meet again when the time is right.‚Äù

With that, Wizard Lifecoat vanished in a swirl of light and color, leaving Jack alone with his thoughts and the fading echoes of the cosmic journey he had just experienced. The rain outside continued its steady pattern, and the room settled back into its familiar, if slightly disheveled, state.

\*\*\*

Paris, or rather the Paris he sought, wasn‚Äôt in the dreary expanse of the usual human settlements. It existed in a delicate bubble of artificial atmosphere, an opulent simile to the City of Light, nestled inside an enormous dome. This was Paris spun from the fantasies of the romantics and dreamers, a place where the grit of reality had been buffed to a mirror sheen and sprinkled with lunar dust.

Jack found himself standing on the edge of a moonlit boulevard, an elegant homage to Parisian streets that wound their way through the dome‚Äôs grandeur. The sky above was a tapestry of inky blackness, a silent spectator to the bustling life below. Neon signs blinked lazily in French‚Äî‚ÄúCaf√© du Lune,‚Äù ‚ÄúLe Monde √âtoil√©,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Dome‚Äù‚Äîall bathed in a glow that contrasted sharply with the harsh lunar landscape beyond.

He wandered through the streets, taking in the surreal spectacle of a city perpetually bathed in the cool, soft light of the moon. The architecture was a blend of classic Parisian charm and futuristic whimsy, with buildings that seemed to float and swirl in defiance of gravity. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of pastries and roasted chestnuts, a sensuous reminder of Earth‚Äôs pleasures.

Jack‚Äôs trench coat, which had felt so out of place in the rain-soaked Portland, now looked oddly appropriate, a relic of a bygone age that fit perfectly into this moonlit masquerade. He was a man out of time, a wanderer whose presence seemed both incongruous and fitting among the artificial splendor of lunar Paris.

He strolled past a caf√©, its outdoor seating area draped with white, flowing curtains that fluttered in the gentle artificial breeze. The tables were occupied by patrons in vintage Parisian attire, their laughter and conversation a pleasant hum against the backdrop of cosmic silence.

Jack slipped into a seat at a small corner table, his gaze fixed on the golden hues of a chandelier overhead.

A waiter approached, his uniform immaculate, a tuxedo that shimmered with an almost otherworldly sheen. ‚ÄúBonsoir, monsieur. What can I get for you?‚Äù

Jack lit a cigarette, the embers glowing softly in the dim light. ‚ÄúA glass of your finest red wine and a croissant. Make it snappy.‚Äù

The waiter nodded with an exaggerated flourish, vanishing into the caf√©‚Äôs interior. Jack leaned back, his eyes scanning the crowd, searching for something‚Äîor someone‚Äîbeyond the superficial allure of this fabricated paradise.

It wasn‚Äôt long before he saw her. She was seated at a table by the window, a woman whose presence seemed to defy the ordinary. Her dress was a shimmering cascade of midnight blue, and her eyes were pools of liquid silver. She had the air of someone who belonged to the hidden chambers of Parisian lore, a woman of secrets and shadows.

Jack watched her with an intensity that bordered on the obsessive. There was something familiar about her, a fragment of a memory he couldn‚Äôt quite place. It wasn‚Äôt long before she looked up, her gaze meeting him with a piercing clarity that sent a shiver down his spine.

The woman rose gracefully from her seat and glided toward Jack‚Äôs table, her movements fluid and deliberate. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from around here,‚Äù she said, her voice a melodious whisper that carried a hint of amusement.

Jack took a long drag from his cigarette before responding. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm looking for someone, or rather, something. They told me Paris might hold the answer.‚Äù

She tilted her head slightly, as if considering his words. ‚ÄúParis, even on the moon, is a city of illusions and revelations. What is it you seek?‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs thoughts swirled like the wisps of smoke curling up from his cigarette. ‚ÄúA guide. Someone who can help me navigate the labyrinth of realities. I was told that Paris‚Äîthis Paris‚Äîmight have the answers.‚Äù

The woman smiled, a gesture that seemed to encapsulate both warmth and mystery. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck, then. I am known for my ability to uncover the hidden paths between worlds. My name is Alice.‚Äù

Jack nodded, his curiosity piqued. ‚ÄúAlice. You‚Äôre the one I‚Äôve been looking for.‚Äù

Alice motioned for him to follow, and they stepped out of the caf√©, into the moonlit streets. The city seemed to come alive around them, the buildings and signs shifting subtly as if responding to their presence. They walked through a series of winding alleys and hidden passages, each more enchanting than the last.

As they moved deeper into the heart of lunar Paris, Jack felt a growing sense of unease. The charm of the city was starting to take on a more sinister edge, as if the beauty of the place was merely a veneer masking something more profound and unsettling.

Alice led him to a secluded courtyard, its center dominated by a grand fountain that spouted water that sparkled like liquid stardust. She gestured for him to sit on a nearby bench.

‚ÄúThis place,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis where the boundaries between worlds become particularly thin. It‚Äôs a point of convergence, where the energies of different realities intersect.‚Äù

Jack took a seat, his mind racing with questions. ‚ÄúWhat happens here? What am I supposed to find?‚Äù

Alice‚Äôs gaze was distant, her eyes reflecting the stars that seemed to hover just beyond the dome‚Äôs transparent surface. ‚ÄúHere, you will encounter fragments of the realities you seek. Pieces of the puzzle that will lead you closer to understanding the rift that threatens to unravel everything.‚Äù

Jack leaned forward, his heart pounding with anticipation. ‚ÄúAnd what about you? What‚Äôs your role in all this?‚Äù

Alice‚Äôs smile returned, but it was tinged with sadness. ‚ÄúI am a guide, but also a keeper of secrets. There are things I cannot reveal, only hint at. Your journey is your own, and you must navigate it with both courage and discernment.‚Äù

The fountain‚Äôs water danced in the moonlight, casting ethereal reflections that seemed to shimmer with hidden meaning. Jack felt as if he were on the verge of a great revelation, a breakthrough that would bring clarity to the tangled threads of his quest.

As the night wore on, the moonlit courtyard grew quiet, the only sound the gentle murmur of the fountain and the distant hum of lunar Paris. Jack and Alice spoke in hushed tones, their conversation a tapestry of riddles and insights, each word a step closer to the truth.

When it was time to part ways, Alice left him with a final piece of advice. ‚ÄúRemember, Jack, the key to understanding is to embrace the unknown. The answers you seek are not always what you expect, and sometimes, the journey itself reveals the truth.‚Äù

Jack watched as she disappeared into the shadows, her figure melding seamlessly with the night. He was alone once more, but the weight of her words hung heavy in his mind. The moonlit city around him seemed both beautiful and haunting, a reminder of the mysteries that lay beyond the surface of reality.

\*\*\*

The shimmering dome of lunar Paris, with its luminous streets and artificial skies, had been but a prelude. Beneath the surface, a hidden civilization thrived in the eternal embrace of night‚Äîa Paris unlike any Jack had ever imagined, a city where shadows held sway and the night never ended.

The descent into this subterranean realm was marked by a series of tunnels lined with iridescent stones that seemed to pulse with an unearthly glow. The air grew cooler as Jack and Alice ventured deeper, the artificial lights of lunar Paris above giving way to the muted, ambient illumination of the underground world. The tunnels twisted and turned, their walls adorned with intricate carvings and tapestries that depicted scenes of opulent decadence and timeless beauty.

Alice led Jack through the labyrinthine passages with the ease of someone deeply familiar with the labyrinthine network. Her presence was a constant, soothing balm, and yet there was something otherworldly about her, as if she were both guide and guardian of secrets far older than the moon itself.

Eventually, they arrived at a grand archway, its surface shimmering with an eerie luminescence. As they stepped through, Jack was met with a breathtaking sight: an entire underground city, a gothic Paris ensconced in the heart of the moon, alive with the pulse of eternal night.

The architecture was a sublime blend of Baroque extravagance and modern sophistication, with towering spires and ornate fa√ßades that seemed to float in the dim light. The streets were lined with grand mansions, their windows framed with heavy drapes that seemed to absorb the light, casting a perpetual twilight over the city. Gas lamps flickered along the avenues, their light casting long, haunting shadows.

The air was thick with the scent of roses and night-blooming jasmine, a fragrance that seemed to intoxicate the senses. The streets were alive with figures who moved with a grace that suggested an inherent understanding of the dark‚Äîa city of ageless elegance and whispered secrets.

As Jack took in the scene, he felt a shiver of apprehension mixed with awe. It was as if he had stumbled into a hidden realm from a dream, a place where time and reality were intertwined in a dance of eternal grace.

Alice led him to a grand mansion at the end of the street, its fa√ßade adorned with intricate carvings of mythical creatures and celestial motifs. The door creaked open with a slow, deliberate motion, and they stepped inside, greeted by the cool, heavy air of a place steeped in history and mystery.

The interior of the mansion was a study in opulence, with high ceilings adorned with crystal chandeliers that cast their spectral light over velvet drapes and antique furnishings. The walls were lined with shelves of ancient tomes and artifacts, each a testament to a civilization that had thrived in secrecy for centuries.

At the center of the grand hall stood a figure of striking elegance: a man whose presence seemed to command the room with an effortless authority. He was tall, with a slender, almost ethereal frame, dressed in a meticulously tailored suit of midnight black. His eyes were deep, dark wells of ancient knowledge, and his face bore the timeless beauty of someone who had witnessed the ebb and flow of centuries.

Alice approached the man with a graceful bow. ‚ÄúLord √âric, I present Jack Straw. He seeks understanding of the rift that threatens our existence.‚Äù

Lord √âric regarded Jack with a piercing gaze, his eyes reflecting a depth that transcended mortal comprehension. ‚ÄúAh, Jack Straw. I‚Äôve heard whispers of your journey. Welcome to our sanctuary.‚Äù

Jack nodded, trying to maintain his composure in the presence of such an imposing figure. ‚ÄúThank you for seeing me. I‚Äôve been told that Paris, beneath the moon, might hold the answers I seek.‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs smile was enigmatic, a blend of amusement and ancient wisdom. ‚ÄúYou are correct. Our city, hidden from the eyes of the world above, has long been a haven for those who seek to understand the deeper mysteries of existence. Here, in the eternal night, we have cultivated knowledge that defies the constraints of time.‚Äù

The lord‚Äôs gaze was intense, and Jack could feel the weight of centuries bearing down upon him. ‚ÄúOur existence here is both a blessing and a curse. We are bound by the night, but it grants us a perspective on the cosmos that few can fathom.‚Äù

As they spoke, the grand hall began to fill with other figures‚Äîvampires who moved with an elegant, predatory grace. Their eyes were luminous, their expressions enigmatic. They greeted Jack with a mix of curiosity and aloofness, their presence a reminder of the timeless world they inhabited.

Lord √âric motioned for Jack to follow, leading him through the mansion‚Äôs labyrinthine corridors to a secluded chamber. The room was adorned with dark, sumptuous fabrics and antique furnishings, only light coming from a large, ornate mirror that reflected a soft, otherworldly glow.

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Lord √âric said, gesturing to the room, ‚Äúis where we study the energies that govern our world and others. The rift you speak of is a tear in the fabric of reality, one that threatens to unravel the delicate balance we have maintained for centuries.‚Äù

Jack took a deep breath, trying to process the gravity of Lord √âric‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúWhat can you tell me about this rift? How do I find a way to repair it?‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs gaze was steady, his eyes reflecting the weight of ages. ‚ÄúThe rift is both a challenge and an opportunity. It is a reflection of the dissonance within the cosmos, a disruption that can only be mended by understanding the true nature of existence. To repair it, you must journey through the layers of reality, seeking the truths that lie hidden in the shadows.‚Äù

The mirror on the wall seemed to shimmer with a life of its own, its surface rippling like water. Lord √âric approached it and placed a hand on its polished surface. ‚ÄúThis mirror is a gateway to other realms, a tool that can guide you through the complexities of the rift. But beware, for each realm you enter will test your resolve and challenge your perceptions.‚Äù

Jack stepped closer, his reflection merging with the shifting patterns in the mirror. The air was charged with an electric tension, a sense of impending revelation. ‚ÄúAnd what is my role in all of this? How do I ensure that the rift is healed?‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs expression softened, a rare glimpse of vulnerability in his timeless features. ‚ÄúYour journey is your own, Jack. You must navigate the labyrinth of reality with both courage and humility. The answers you seek will reveal themselves in time, but remember: the path is fraught with danger, and the choices you make will shape the fate of many.‚Äù

The night deepened and the moon‚Äôs light continued to cast its ethereal glow over the hidden city, Jack felt a profound sense of purpose. The mysteries of lunar Paris were unfolding before him, and with the guidance of Lord √âric and the enigmatic vampires who thrived in this eternal night, he was prepared to confront the rift and uncover the truths that lay beyond.

\*\*\*

The corridor seemed to stretch endlessly, each turn revealing more of the moon‚Äôs dark secrets. The grandeur of the mansion, once a symbol of ancient elegance, now felt like a fa√ßade, concealing something far more sinister. Jack‚Äôs thoughts churned with the gravity of their discussions and the mysteries that lay ahead.

Lord √âric‚Äôs demeanor was as inscrutable as ever. His eyes, dark and fathomless, betrayed nothing of his thoughts. ‚ÄúWe need to be cautious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe mirror has shown us that the nature of our existence here is more complex than we initially believed.‚Äù

Jack nodded, his mind racing. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Lord √âric stopped abruptly and turned to face Jack. ‚ÄúWe are not the only ones watching. There are eyes beyond the veil of our world, and they do not have our best interests at heart.‚Äù

Before Jack could ask more, a sudden flash of light from a nearby room caught their attention. It was an unsettling, glaring illumination that seemed to pierce through the illusion of their surroundings. They exchanged a look of concern and moved cautiously toward the source.

As they entered the room, Jack‚Äôs stomach tightened. The scene before him was as disturbing as it was surreal. What had appeared to be a lavish lounge, filled with decadent furnishings and indulgent comforts, now revealed itself as a studio‚Äîcomplete with cameras, lights, and a control booth. The walls were lined with monitors displaying images of the city, and the room itself had the sterile, impersonal feel of a broadcasting studio.

At the center of the room stood a large monitor, its screen showing a live feed of lunar Paris. The images flickered and shifted, revealing scenes from the bustling streets to the intimate corners of private residences. Jack‚Äôs heart sank as he realized the implications.

‚ÄúIt seems we have been deceived. This city, this entire existence here‚Äîit‚Äôs a spectacle for others.‚Äù

Jack took a deep breath, trying to grasp the enormity of what they were witnessing. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs behind this? Who‚Äôs watching?‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs eyes darkened with anger. ‚ÄúThe eyes on Saturn. They have exploited our world, turning our lives into entertainment for their amusement. They broadcast our existence as if it were a show, manipulating and controlling us from afar.‚Äù

The control room was occupied by figures who moved with the efficiency of professionals but with an air of cold detachment. Their faces were obscured by masks, and their voices were mechanical and devoid of warmth. They operated the equipment with a practiced ease, manipulating the live feeds and adjusting the cameras.

Jack‚Äôs hands clenched into fists as he took in the sight. The realization that their lives were being broadcast and manipulated for the pleasure of distant, voyeuristic eyes was a bitter pill to swallow. It was not just the invasion of privacy but the desecration of their existence.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Jack asked, his voice rough with emotion. ‚ÄúWhy do they do this?‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs voice was heavy with a mixture of sadness and resolve. ‚ÄúControl and exploitation. They feed on our fears and desires, using them to manipulate us. It is a means of maintaining their power and influence.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs mind raced, piecing together the implications. ‚ÄúSo this city, this moon‚Äîwhat‚Äôs it all for?‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs gaze was resolute. ‚ÄúIt was designed to be a fa√ßade, a grand illusion. The moon‚Äôs Paris is a bordello of sorts, a place where the indulgences of its inhabitants are exploited for the entertainment of others. The inhabitants are subject to blackmail and extortion, manipulated into compliance.‚Äù

Jack took a deep breath, his anger rising like a storm. ‚ÄúWe have to do something. We can‚Äôt just let this continue.‚Äù

Lord √âric nodded, his expression determined. ‚ÄúWe will need to find a way to expose the truth and liberate those who are trapped within this spectacle. But first, we must understand the full extent of their control.‚Äù

They turned their attention back to the control room, where the figures continued their work with cold efficiency. Jack and Lord √âric moved carefully, avoiding detection, and began to gather evidence of the broadcasts and the manipulation that lay behind them.

Hours passed as they worked, their movements swift and purposeful. They documented the feeds, noted the connections between the broadcast and the control mechanisms, and devised a plan to reveal the truth to the people of lunar Paris.

As dawn approached‚Äîthe artificial dawn of a simulated day‚Äîthe room grew quieter. The figures in the control room seemed to become more complacent, their attention diverted by the routines of their work. Jack and Lord √âric took advantage of the moment, preparing to execute their plan.

\*\*\*

Jack and Lord √âric had escaped the surveillance room with their precious evidence clutched in hand. The illicit feeds and the dark secrets of Saturnian control were now a ticking time bomb. They had to expose the machinery of illusion that enslaved the moon's denizens, or risk becoming cogs in a corrupt system that fed off their despair and voyeuristic thrills.

Reality itself seemed to be deteriorating as Jack navigated the warped alleys of this moonlit nightmare. The air was thick with the smell of burning opiates, the kind that drifts through a trap house where the human mind is stretched thin across the jagged edges of perception. Reality was a frail construct, breaking down under the weight of its own absurdity.

‚ÄúLook at it, man,‚Äù Jack muttered to himself, his voice a strained whisper. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre caught in some kind of hallucinatory fever dream, a bastardization of a city that‚Äôs nothing but a glorified snuff film for those Saturnian pricks.‚Äù

Lord √âric moved beside him, his expression grim. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a fever dream. It‚Äôs a system of control, a manipulation of everything we thought was real. We need to disrupt it, tear down the illusion before it collapses us.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs thoughts swirled with the disjointed fragments of their plan. He was losing track of time, or rather, he was losing his grip on what time meant in this warped reality. The moon‚Äôs

Paris was a maze of disintegration, a living hallucination that fed on the primal fears and unspoken desires of its inhabitants.

They reached the underbelly of the city, a place where the opulence gave way to decay. The streets were littered with discarded luxury, and the once-glittering facades of the grand buildings had become peeling carcasses. This was the raw, unfiltered truth behind the facade of lunar Paris, a place where the illusion of grandeur was stripped away to reveal the mechanical heart of exploitation.

In the shadows of a crumbling theater, they found their way into a hidden room, where the machinery of control was housed‚Äîa sprawling network of screens, wires, and blinking lights that pulsed with an ominous rhythm. The system was a monstrous conglomeration of surveillance and control, a beast that fed off the private lives of the moon's inhabitants.

Jack‚Äôs mind raced as he looked at the chaotic expanse of the control room. The machinery was a grotesque assembly of metal and circuitry, a pulsating entity that seemed almost alive. It was an intricate web of voyeurism and manipulation, a perverse masterpiece that turned human lives into a spectacle for the Saturnian elite.

‚ÄúWe need to disrupt this,‚Äù Jack said, his voice a blend of determination and fatigue. ‚ÄúBurn the circuits, break the feeds. We‚Äôll take down their whole sordid show.‚Äù

Lord √âric nodded, his face set in grim resolve. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be easy. They‚Äôll have contingencies, security measures. But it has to be done. We have to free the city from this nightmare.‚Äù

They set to work, their actions frantic and desperate. Jack hacked into the network, his fingers dancing across the controls as he tried to unravel the web of surveillance. The screens flickered and distorted, the live feeds warping into a psychedelic swirl of chaos.

As the system began to collapse, the reality of lunar Paris seemed to warp and fragment. The walls of the control room shuddered, the artificial night outside shifting into bizarre patterns of color and light. The city itself seemed to convulse, its structures bending and warping as if reacting to the disintegration of the illusion.

Jack felt a strange sense of exhilaration mixed with dread. The reality he had known was unraveling, and he was at the center of the storm. The truth was pouring out, raw and unfiltered, a torrent of dark revelations and broken dreams.

The final act was a frenetic dance of destruction. The machinery sparked and whirred, its systems unraveling in a spectacular display of failure. The feeds cut out one by one, the images of lunar Paris dissolving into static and darkness.

Jack and Lord √âric stood in the heart of the chaos, their faces illuminated by the dying light of the control room. The city outside was a fractured illusion, its glamor shattered and its secrets laid bare.

Jack took a deep breath, trying to steady his racing mind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. We‚Äôve exposed them.‚Äù

Lord √âric‚Äôs eyes were distant, reflecting the chaos of their surroundings. ‚ÄúFor now. But the world is a dark place, and the forces we‚Äôve uncovered will not vanish easily.‚Äù

The control room fell silent, Jack and Lord √âric emerged into the wreckage of lunar Paris. The city was still, its once-immaculate streets now strewn with the debris of shattered illusions. The empty void of space was a bitter reminder of the cost of their quest for truth.

Jack looked up at the galaxy, where the moon‚Äôs eternal night seemed to stretch into infinity. The city around him was a ghost, a reflection of the darkness beneath the surface of reality.

Do I stay or go?,"My (21M) ex (20M) and I work at the same place. It‚Äôs a coffee shop with only about 10 employees. I got him the job as a seasonal employee in 2022 and he has been seasonal since then. He decided to move here year-round so became a full-year (regular) employee back in August. He‚Äôs a great worker and very dependable.

Since he‚Äôs been hired, I‚Äôve worked my way up to the manager of the coffee shop. The only person above me is the owner. We are all a very tight-knit team and most of us are friends outside of work. In September, he broke up with me after we tried to fix some issues for months. It wasn‚Äôt working out, so fine, whatever. But he chose to continue working at the coffee shop, to everyone‚Äôs surprise.

Only two of my employees are neutral. The rest of the employees are good friends of ours, but after seeing the way he treated me for a long time and things he‚Äôs done to me in the past, everyone jumped to my side after the breakup. Regardless, he‚Äôs staying at the job. 

My boss said today that he will likely replace me when I graduate college and leave. It stung a bit, but I understand her reasoning.

Now that we‚Äôve been broken up nearly two months, I find that being around him is holding me back from moving on from these negative feelings. He goes out of his way to hug my coworkers and be fake-nice to them. He told one of my coworkers, who struggles with mental health, that I‚Äôd never understand her fully because I never struggled with mental health issues like he and she did. 

I just want to leave this job, but I am in a leadership role with great pay, benefits, flexible time-off, and I get to make my own schedule. It‚Äôs a great gig for a college student. He is a regular, minimum-wage employee. We live in a massive city where it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for him to find a new job. I worry that if I try to stick it out I‚Äôm just going to be stuck feeling sad/angry all the time while I watch him hug my friends and compare himself to me to get closer to them.

1gec1r7,https://amzn.to/4f0xWqE,Review of the Norwegian Breakaway - October 20th to 27th,"
I recently had the pleasure of sailing on the Norwegian Breakaway from October 20th to 27th, and I wanted to share my experience with you all.

Room 11876: Our room was spotless, and the bed was super comfy. The balcony was a bit small for two, but it was still nice to have. There were only two outlets, so I highly recommend bringing an extension if you need more. A portable charger also came in handy for keeping our devices powered up.

Cleanliness and Common Areas: The ship was very clean, but it could use some TLC in a few areas. The common areas like restaurants, bars, and the casino were packed on sea days, but you could still get around easily. The atrium on Deck 6 was a bit hard to get to during games and events, but it was still accessible. They could use more seating there. A collapsible water bottle was a lifesaver for staying hydrated without having to constantly get drinks.

Dining: The food at the Garden Cafe on Deck 15 was a bit disappointing. The selection was limited, and the quality wasn‚Äôt great. I dined at two premium restaurants: Moderno Churrascaria on Deck 8 and Teppanyaki on Deck 6. Moderno was decent, but it didn‚Äôt feel authentic. Teppanyaki was very good, though. Shanghai‚Äôs Noodle House on Deck 7 was excellent and is included in the cruise price. As an early riser, I set out to find food at 4 am some mornings with no luck. O‚ÄôSheehan‚Äôs Bar & Grille on Deck 7 claims to be a 24/7 pub-style restaurant, but it is not. They will serve you coffee and a couple of Danish, but that‚Äôs it. Apparently, the only true 24/7 food option you have is room service, which carries a $7.99 fee. They do start serving actual breakfast at 5:30 am at O‚ÄôSheehan‚Äôs. A travel coffee mug was perfect for those early morning coffee runs.

Pools and Hot Tubs: The pools and hot tubs were super accessible because of the time of year. The average temperature was around 55 degrees during the day, so they weren‚Äôt too crowded. A quick-dry towel was great for those chilly dips in the pool.

Overall, I had a wonderful time on the Norwegian Breakaway. Despite a few minor issues, the experience was enjoyable, and I would recommend it to others. Happy cruising! üö¢üòä

We talk about outselves , work , interests and all that and hit it off well.

He and me end the date but continue talking for another day before he invites me to his place

I wait all day for the time to come to meet with him again, getting myself ready and thinking about where things could go.

It is a late meet up , he just got home from work and the gym and he invites me inside.
He has a hookah setup going and a glass of wine ready and we sit down and have some slow jamz going.

He has a nice smart place all setuo to control the ac , lights and music from voice commands and all that so I was impressed.

So we talk and then he moves closer asking if I like a massage and I agree  he starts with my shoulders and back and just cops a feel on my entire torso area but thats ok , his touch is putting me in the mood.
We look at eachother for a second before we both go for a kiss my first with a guy and it was awesome .
Tender and sensual , then more passionate and during this moment he starts to lift my shirt up and follows that by taking off his too.

Next thing you know both of us are undressed and in his bedroom and he kinda guides me to lay down and begins grinding against me while we are both hard

He guides me further wants me to lay on him in the 69 position and wow
Getting my ass bite and kissed , dick sucked while doing it back was insane.

I never felt so hot during sex and thats where we both came .

I know theres more to happen but anybody else ever feel so hot after there first time and wonder if they are not Bi?",10,1730146584.0,askgaybros,4,0.92,False

It‚Äôs a coffee shop with only about 10 employees. I got him the job as a seasonal employee in 2022 and he has been seasonal since then. He decided to move here year-round so became a full-year (regular) employee back in August. He‚Äôs a great worker and very dependable.

Since he‚Äôs been hired, I‚Äôve worked my way up to the manager of the coffee shop. The only person above me is the owner. We are all a very tight-knit team and most of us are friends outside of work. In September, he broke up with me after we tried to fix some issues for months. It wasn‚Äôt working out, so fine, whatever. But he chose to continue working at the coffee shop, to everyone‚Äôs surprise.

Only two of my employees are neutral. The rest of the employees are good friends of ours, but after seeing the way he treated me for a long time and things he‚Äôs done to me in the past, everyone jumped to my side after the breakup. Regardless, he‚Äôs staying at the job. 

My boss said today that he will likely replace me when I graduate college and leave. It stung a bit, but I understand her reasoning.

Now that we‚Äôve been broken up nearly two months, I find that being around him is holding me back from moving on from these negative feelings. He goes out of his way to hug my coworkers and be fake-nice to them. He told one of my coworkers, who struggles with mental health, that I‚Äôd never understand her fully because I never struggled with mental health issues like he and she did. 

I just want to leave this job, but I am in a leadership role with great pay, benefits, flexible time-off, and I get to make my own schedule. It‚Äôs a great gig for a college student. He is a regular, minimum-wage employee. We live in a massive city where it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for him to find a new job. I worry that if I try to stick it out I‚Äôm just going to be stuck feeling sad/angry all the time while I watch him hug my friends and compare himself to me to get closer to them.

1gebx2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1gebx2h/would_you_consider_these_to_be_red_flags_when/,Would you consider these to be red flags when seeing a PTSD/trauma-focused therapist? Should I switch?,"Hi everyone. First-time joiner, and a long-time PTSD have-r. TLDR: I have PTSD from childhood trauma I had as a kid from heavy bullying and other unfortunate things that happened. After having a neuro/psych evaluation recently, it's been made official that I have PTSD, along with depression, anxiety, and inattentive ADHD. The doctor who did the neuro/psych evaluation recommended a local facility down the street and I made an appointment with a specific therapist since he was the soonest available one.

Here's where the potential red flags come into play:

* I came in, no one was at the front desk, so I sat down and waited. A few minutes passed by and he came out of his office room (he wasn't seeing anyone). He was a little late but I disregarded it.
* I finally came into the room, and it seemed he wasn't prepared for my situation, so he had to log on to his work laptop, skim through my intake forms (didn't know about my neuro/psych report I sent the facility). And he finally sat down on his therapist chair. Not sure if it's just me, but if I were a therapist, I'd certainly want to prepare myself and read through forms/reports from my patient to know the situation at hand.
* He began asking me questions in typical therapist fashion which I welcome, but the kicker here is that I saw him almost nodding each time I would answer the questions! I think he also noticed that I noticed that he was fighting from falling asleep, but that's definitely not something I wanted to happen, intro meeting or not.

I scheduled an appointment to begin EMDR therapy next week with him, and I mentioned this to my wife and she said I should call to be changed to another therapist. I thought maybe I should give him one shot since he may not be a coffee drinker or something, but that's a little wild to me. I feel like I should switch to someone else, but I'm curious what your opinion is on the matter.

Thanks for your input in advance! I wish everyone the best of luck in your healing journey. üíú",3,1730146394.0,ptsd,4,1.0,False

1gebvfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1gebvfe/rant_of_all_rants/,Rant of all rants,"I‚Äôm posting here because I don‚Äôt know how well it would be received in the adoption Reddit and step parent is more akin to our situation. 

Long story short(ish)-my husbands sister has been a heroin addict since high school. Their mother was also an addict. When she had her first daughter, my FIL gained custody while she went to prison. I met husband when the girl was about 5. I‚Äôve always been nothing but kind and endearing to her. I‚Äôm ‚Äúbig into‚Äù treating kids as well as possible and all that. 
We married when she was 7.
Shortly after, I had my first. We have 3 bio kids. When I had my first, we even moved in with FIL so I could be more of a mother figure to her. I tried so hard but FIL undermined EVERYTHING I did (like simply saying she has to eat dinner at a table with us instead of in front of a TV) and I just couldn‚Äôt take it while raising my own son there so we moved closer to my parents. 
FIL passed away when she was 13. That was a shit show of things to deal with that my husband had to sort out. SD mother was living with FIL and SD. SIL just had her fourth baby. (Middle two are with their respective paternal grandparents) SIL immediately signed rights of the teenager over to us but kept her baby as a human shield and ask that we send her back to her home state. We offered her live with us and found her a methadone clinic but she refused. That baby has now been adopted by family in the area after being taken by CPS. Mom is still strung out and in and out of prison, never contacts daughter. Lots of animosity with that but neither here nor there. 

So now we have had the teenage daughter for about a year and a half. She obviously came with issues as FIL was highly emotionally neglectful. (Sense a pattern?) We immediately got her into therapy but that didn‚Äôt last long as we now couldn‚Äôt afford to live where we were with an added mouth and we had to move. Returning her to therapy is top priority. My husband has just had 4 different jobs since moving (always working 1 or multiple jobs- he can‚Äôt make up his mind I guess. He‚Äôs an addictions counselor and I can tell it‚Äôs starting to wear on him given his past) and we all know how insurance is. 

Anyway, the teenager is, at times wonderful. She can be kind and funny and helpful so I know there is an essence of emotional intelligence there. Frankly put, she is dumb as a brick though. It is somewhat aggravating to have to deal with but never something I‚Äôd hold personally against her. She‚Äôs also drop dead gorgeous which really doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with her behavior but it somewhat helps paint a picture that she does have beauty on her side but unfortunately that also creates it‚Äôs own problems. 

The behavior problem is that as a whole, she drives me absolutely insane. She abuses absolutely every privilege we give to her. We gave her a stipend of $50 a month when we first got her so she can learn to budget and stop asking for frivolous things and she ordered lingerie online. She came with an iPhone (which has now been taken). I took the phone because she was giving me BAD attitude about how she needs $500 for new school clothes. I had literally just bought her an entire new wardrobe-that she picked out-because she refused to bring any old clothes from her old house. I simple asked for her to tell me what she wants to get rid of and then I asked her why she thinks I should give her money when she‚Äôs dumping clothes that I bought her two months ago. Anyway, go through her phone and come to find pictures of her smoking pot along with indecent photos on her phone, with her new friend from our current area-not from where she used to live. When she got her phone back (after we moved from our larger house) I was contacted by the principal of her school because she was posting inappropriate tiktoks (on a secret account, as I thought I followed her official one and her secret one-turns out she had multiple secret ones) She asks to hang out with a friend at her new school (we put her in private after the pot incident and moving) and she winds up going to friends cousins 21st birthday party. 

At this point, she went a few months with no phone and that‚Äôs when I saw that she can be kind. When she got a phone again, she immediately plummeted. Then we tried a Bark phone for a bit but that was glitchy and was too expensive so we bought her a light phone. Sure it‚Äôs not cool and it sucks to live in 2005 but it was still a $300 purchase so she could have easy access to texting and phone calls. You can also add music to it, although you have to use a laptop but we‚Äôve shown her how multiple times) She still gets access to an old smartphone, just not in her bedroom and she can‚Äôt take it places. Not even a thank-you and she wouldn‚Äôt even touch the thing for the longest time. I talked with her about being ungrateful. I proceeded to buy her a vlogging camera (since her light phone doesn‚Äôt have a camera) where you can send your content via WiFi to a smartphone so you don‚Äôt have to deal with memory cards and laptops. No thank you, and she hasn‚Äôt even opened it. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the ‚Äúrodents‚Äù. This summer, my husband has finally given me the okay to start breeding show quality ‚Äúanimals‚Äù (to try to stay relatively anonymous) Always been a dream of mine and it‚Äôs taken a lot of convincing and saving. Well all of a sudden she wants to breed ‚Äúrodents‚Äù and I can‚Äôt do a single thing for my animals without her nagging about getting these ‚Äúrodents‚Äù. I‚Äôm an animal person so I figured I‚Äôd give her an opportunity and get the rodents. (After much talk with her and warning about care, ect ect) (which I had to really convince my husband on) I pulled two all nighters building a custom cage for them in her room. (Which is kind of a big deal considering I have 3 kids under 6 and a bi-polar 1 diagnosis so I really need my sleep or else everyone is going to my moms for a week while I hang with my mania at the psych ward). The cage doesn‚Äôt stay clean and she doesn‚Äôt get them out. Honestly, I take full responsibility on that one. It was mainly so I wouldn‚Äôt have to hear about it anymore and now I have proof for her why I don‚Äôt have to support her every whim. Also, I do make sure the rodents get cared for properly while she‚Äôs at school. 

Other notable mentions are that I truly put my money where my mouth is in my parenting her. I quit vaping right when we got her. I did go back to the psych ward about six months into her being with us and picked vaping up again after but then quit yet again. I mean, I even quit Reddit. This was my toxic account where I only take negativity to for an outlet and I haven‚Äôt even been on here in nearly six months. I‚Äôm not expecting her to be a certain way with her phone without modeling it myself. Oh, and I‚Äôve also completely given up all sugars AND sweeteners. It‚Äôs been about 3 months. I know that‚Äôs kind of silly but that‚Äôs a big thing in this day and age and I think it counts as a point for me in displaying positive behavior, especially in regards to addiction. 

At this point, I‚Äôve talked to her about her behavior and she has improved maybe 10% but it keeps creeping back. She is so incredibly rude and then she tries to play dumb. What sucks is that she IS dumb so I‚Äôve been very patient but at this point, I‚Äôve seen enough to know when she‚Äôs being manipulative. 

She‚Äôs ungrateful for anything. She asks for something, I buy it, and then she doesn‚Äôt want it and she trashes it. And then all of a sudden wants the same thing yet again. Obviously the buying for her has dwindled but she still nags for things and if I finally get it or have her earn it, the cycle is the same. 

She won‚Äôt ever eat the dinners I make, maybe a few bites, but then she‚Äôll go in and try to make a snack or something and leave everything out so all the bagels are hard and the cream cheese has gone bad overnight. 

We enjoy carbonated water and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I won‚Äôt let her have one unless she does a small menial task (because I just really need the help around the house-NOT because I‚Äôm stingy) 
But she will routinely go in and get one without asking-which is really not that big a deal except that she takes one sip then leaves it out and never finishes it. It‚Äôs so wasteful and she has no regard. My husband confronted her with 4 of her nearly full carbonated waters (over the span of two days) that have gone flat and she still hasn‚Äôt curbed this because she simply doesn‚Äôt care. I have to hide any quality coffee I buy up in my room because she‚Äôll brew 2+ coffees every day only to take a sip and leave them for me to deal with. I haven‚Äôt even been able to try a new brand because Id have to bring it down and make it in secret then return it to my room and that‚Äôs too much. I gave up my coffee creamer entirely because I couldn‚Äôt afford how she wastes it. I‚Äôm highly considering putting a lock BACK on the fridge. (We had one for a period because our younger bio kids would take a bite from an apple and leave it out-but the suspect in question was 2 years old) 

She‚Äôll go into my bathroom and just take stuff without asking and never put it back. I‚Äôve confronted her on this and obviously no improvement. She‚Äôs lost two of the hair brushes I bought her (she still has others) so she uses mine, which is fine, but just put it back. When we first got her, she‚Äôd take my makeup completely without asking and literally ruin it and just leave it trashed around her room. My makeup is now in a lock box but I still make sure she has more than enough of her own. 
So you get the general picture by now. All of those things, I took in stride, truly. I have made the promise to myself that if she does something that I‚Äôd chew my bio kids out for, I must say something but I do so with kindness. 

So why am I all of the sudden extra butthurt? I threw a birthday party for my two  young bio daughters last weekend and we had the agreement that if she helped clean up, I‚Äôd pay for this thing she wanted to go to (which was much more expensive than the work needed) Mind you, she didn‚Äôt wind up going and she do /some/ chores that she will still be paid for. But I had to repetitively beg her to do them and she obviously half assed it. I made it very clear that my biggest concern was the floors needing cleaned. She had days to do this and I reminded her a couple hours before the party and went out to decorate. I came back and the floors are still trashed and she said she couldn‚Äôt find the mop. Im not buying it. The floors weren‚Äôt even swept and the mop was in its location that it always is. My 6yo son mopped the floors-right after he stepped foot into the house-when my parents brought the little kids. He did complain, but he did them well. And he‚Äôs 6. I think it‚Äôs passive aggression but the thing is, I told her that I was excited to get all these decorations because I can re-use them for her party. I‚Äôve already started a Pinterest board (with her picked theme) for her party before I even had the girls. If this is a jealousy issue, it surely isn‚Äôt from my doing. By the day before the party, I realized that she will not be doing much helping at all and I simply just asked her if she could ‚Äúpick up after herself for this weekend‚Äù and mentioned specifically what needs taken to her room. She left her stuff everywhere for me to deal with and left a barely drank old coffee literally right on the dining table where I had the welcome area set up-right in front of the welcome sign I wrote (not even in her usual sitting place at the table) I‚Äôve grown out of believing that she‚Äôs just inept. There‚Äôs no way that this can‚Äôt be a subtle ‚Äúscrew you‚Äù. I‚Äôm starting to think she resents me for..being happy? Having a good childhood? Never cussing her out? Always listening and understanding what she needs to vent about and offering insight? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what it could be other than resenting that I have it ‚Äúput together‚Äù? Which I don‚Äôt-the house is never as clean as I‚Äôd like and often dinner is served late. But I homeschool the little kids and I am always emotionally available to anyone when they need me, especially her. 

To add insult to injury, she couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to be kind to the party guests. This is what did it in for me. Now stay with me here. I have some truly wonderful friends. One in particular, came early to help set up a sectional couch in the yard for me. This friend has been an amazing resource for SD because the friend had a troubled upbringing as well. She has her phone number and gives advice that I stay completely out of. I‚Äôve made it clear that I trust this friend to be a confidant aside from me. She has had sleepovers at her house and said friend has taken her shopping and given her some pretty lavish gifts. Anyway, friend comes in and SD is painting her nails in a narrow hallway over the kitchen counter (weird house layout) while I frantically prep and humor her yap about teenage drama. Friend greets SD. SD proceeds to not even turn her head yet alone move out of the way, makes a side eye and purses her lips then continues painting nails. I wish I had said something there but I didn‚Äôt want to publicly humiliate her. I can handle messiness and what not but direct rudeness is a no-go for me. It may take energy to put your bagels away but it doesn‚Äôt take anything to be kind. Her excuse is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù but being tired doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be a bitch. You want to talk tired? I‚ÄôM tired! But I still meet that constant phrase from her with understanding because I know what it‚Äôs like to be a chronically tired teenager. 

So this morning she‚Äôs going to school and I told her to take the carbonated water in the plastic releasable bottles instead of one in the can. She pouts and we just go. Won‚Äôt talk to me in the car whatsoever. 

It‚Äôs funny because those few months where she didn‚Äôt have her phone, she was either putting on a really good show or she was actually kind and understanding. She‚Äôd help around the house without asking and she was personable. The helping this is also NOT what I place her value in. I hate how much I feel like an evil stepmother for simply requiring that she do chores. My 4yo daughter will hand wash the dishes that pile up because the teen won‚Äôt do it. At 2, my youngest will do chores (with MUCH coaxing but still) I‚Äôm trying to tread this area where I don‚Äôt treat the teen like my maid but I have made the mistake of giving her special treatment for fear of the Cinderella perception. I‚Äôd never let the stuff she does fly with the bio kids.

I have to get her from school in an hour or so and I think I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that she will not get her phone until the entire house is clean and stays routinely clean for a week. I WILL be the one cleaning it! I‚Äôm NOT asking her to to that. I‚Äôm simply saying that if she wants to help, she‚Äôll get PAID for it and it‚Äôll go faster, but if not, I will do it all and it will be longer. All carbonated water is now in a cooler in our bedroom so I can keep the fridge unlocked is she wants a snack. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs insane? If you disagree with me, I welcome perspective but please be gentle because I don‚Äôt want another reason to further resent her. I‚Äôm really trying here. This is clearly a huge vent sesh and I‚Äôm looking for validation. I get a lot of validation from my support system but honestly I‚Äôd like to just like to be able to keep her name out of my mouth with them so I‚Äôm not constantly talking about it when she‚Äôs away. 

She always has a new mental illness that she diagnosed with herself when she‚Äôs on her phone too much. I do take that seriously and tread very lightly in those conversations. But she may be depressed, or have other disorders, it doesn‚Äôt excuse blatant rudeness. My husband works with a lot of licensed therapists and they say that her issues line up completely with one of an addict. Completely entitled. Syrupy sweet if you have what they want and will throw you to the birds once they get it or find out you won‚Äôt give it to them. I‚Äôm realllllly trying not to but I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs a psychopath. Apparently FIL actually got psychopathy as a formal diagnosis which would explain it, especially since he had his terrible effect on raising her for 13 years. 

I‚Äôm just so over putting all this emotional labor and financial effort into her for her to be like this. I want her out but I know if she moves out at 18, she‚Äôll become like her mother.
