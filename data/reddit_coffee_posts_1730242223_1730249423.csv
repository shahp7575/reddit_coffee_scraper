This is probably gonna be a long one so sorry in advance.

So this probably started a few months ago, me (22f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for 2 years, everything was great when we first got together. We had been together previously when we were 15/16 but split, lost contact etc. After a few months of being together I had got my own place and he moved in with me.

When he moved in I asked if he could help me pay towards the bills if I need help. He agreed as he was working at the time. He then lost his job and done(and is still doing) an illegal job that I don’t want to name lol. We’re both marijuana smokers so he would pay for our weed and I would pay for the roof over our heads. 

After a few months he let slip that sometimes he tries to calculate how much money he’s spent on weed for the two of us and multiple shop trips/buying food. I was a bit taken back by that because I didn’t think about how much money i’m spending on two people when I get a one person salary. We then had multiple arguments over numerous things, the main thing being that he didn’t get sex often enough. I apologised but I have an unhealthy relationship with food and sometimes can’t stand the sight of my own body.

He would say that i’m using that and my mental health as an excuse as to why I won’t give him sex. He would threaten to leave and I would always beg him to stay, but in these arguments it would always be my flat that gets destroyed. He broke one of my coffee tables during an argument, kicked my tv into the wall it dented the wall, head butted the fridge it caused a dent, kicked a cup and stained the wall, and more things.

After a while I just ended up getting fed up and just trying to please him because, and i know it’s probably selfish, but financially I can’t survive. When we moved in he bought his cat, and we ended up buying another one together, and then he (with me expressing I don’t want one) went and bought a dog. I know if i was to leave him he would take the dog and probably his cat with him. Which is fine but I can’t work because of my mental health and I can’t afford to pay my rent, all of my bills and buy food. He helps me (sometimes) buy food but normally it’s just takeaways.

Recently i’ve just started to feel fed up with the relationship, he makes subtle little digs at silly things. Like if i was to wake up early and let him sleep in because he hasn’t told me he wants to be woken up, he’ll make dogs about how I should’ve woken him up. Or if he’s annoyed at me he will verbally say he’s “fucking pissed off” but if i’m annoyed at him, I can’t express that otherwise it causes an argument.

I feel like I want to leave him and my friends tell me to leave him as well, I just don’t know if me feeling like this is a good enough reason?

0.0 This is brazilian football, a Hug!



1.0 **IT'S OVER! IT'S OVER! THE FLAME N' GO IS THE CHAMPION OF THE LIBERATORS OF BASKETBALL!**

1.1  **WE PICKED OLIMPIA HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! PALMEIRAS AND COCK! HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA ATHHLHETHiC AT ALTITUDE, WE PICKED OLIMPIA, BOY! FLAME N' GO AND OLIMPIA IN THE OCTAVES OF FREEPAINS. I DONT BELIEVE. SENSATIONAL! WE PICKED OLIMPIA,  THANK GOD**




1.2 **I HATE PSG SO MUCH AND I USE THEIR SHIRTS AS A CLOT

As soon as that ridiculous pink and purple shirt became fashionable and all the ""humans"" who are more imbecile than a surfboard bought it, I bought one too

and since that day I clean everything that gets dirty in my room with it

EVERYTHING

including blood and that milk that humans release when they are at the height of pleasure for many people of all kinds without prejudice

It's been 2 years now that it's always been damp and giving off an enormous stench (I've never washed it)

When this stench becomes unbearable and impossible to ignore, I'm going to set fire to this damn thing and replace it with one from FlaBitch

And I'm going to make a lot of mess with this Flame N' Go shirt on purpose

just to stain this team of thieving bums who only win with the whistle

I'm considering using FlaShit's shirt as toilet paper too**




1.4 **HOLY SHIT THE TEAM IN THIS SITUATION AND THE GUY HAVING LUNCH**

It brings horrible traumas to many people who are triggered and feel sick and faint Delete it for the love of God Please delete it There are people who really feel sick seeing this. Delete it Everyone is asking you to delete it This is a trigger for many people. Please delete it It's serious My God Delete it People are going to die There are people being hospitalized Delete it now For the love of God I'm asking you to delete it**





1.6 **I WOKE UP AND SUCH, THEN I WENT TO THE KITCHEN TO HAVE SOME COFFEE AND MY NIECE CAME RUNNING TO HUG ME TO SAY GOOD MORNING, I IMMEDIATELY KICKED HER, THREW HER AT THE DOOR, GOOD MORNING MY ASS, TODAY IS WAR DAY, FREEPAINS/LIBERATORS DAY, GOOD MORNING DUDE, YOU BITCH AND THE KID COMES TO SAY GOOD MORNING TO ME, WORSE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME WITH AN UGLY FACE, SAYING I'M CRAZY LOL HAHAHAHAHAHA CRAZY THEY'LL SEE WHEN [PLAYER 1] MAKES THAT MASTERFUL THROW AND [PLAYER 2] COMPLETES IT FOR THE GOAL, DUDE GOOD MORNING**




1.8 **Unfortunately, the competition is over

There are no longer any rivals that are worthy of Saints in Brazil or South America. Perhaps, like Australia, which moved from Oceania to Asian football in search of greater challenges, it is time for Soteldo and Marinho's team to go to Europe and play in the English Championship, or in a bolder move, to join FIFA as a national team and compete in the 2022 Qatar World Cup.



1.8 2 - LET'S SEE IF PUB CANVAS(BARCELONA) IS ALL THIS 






1.9 **About the excess of posts about Flame n' go in the sub

Guys, for God's sake, let's be aware of what you do there, Flame n' go was champion of two straight competitions? Beauty, quiet, deserves discussion, but there is a lot of content here that can very well go to r/Flame n' go and no one here would miss.

So, starting today, I will have to start deleting some posts that would have a better place in the club itself, sorry.

Edit: Reading the complaints, it's not a matter of just being flame n' go, posts from other clubs will go along too. I'm not talking about deleting meme, joke, the things that are the nee of football and that make it fun, yes to take things like ""see list of related Flame n' go for the next game"" or ""Luan posts video on Instagram singing hymn from Grêmio"", will not make a very big change in the sub, but it is already filtering a little**




1.10 **What a terrible thing, what a losing institution, this shirt smells of failure, it smells of shame

It's a shame that there are still morons blaming only Renato the fuck. It's obvious that these guys are soft-headed, wearing high heels. Everton Ribeiro's skinny bald head wants to decorate the whole damn thing. Damn, punch the fucking ball into the goal, you fucking insect. Kick it and it looks like you're wearing Senninha's sandals, damn it.

That's a little letter, a heel; you concede a goal and you're shaken. This shit only plays with old, limp, deformed people yelling on the sidelines and fans. This shit needs a beating. Get 7 donkey kongs from Young Fla and make them slap Ribeiro's head, beat Gabigoal, fuck Arão's wife.

Fuck it up the ass. Seriously, pathetic. It's no use, man, Flame n' go is a team of shame, of failure; it's in the club's aura. No one respects Flame n' go Club of Regattas, the most mediocre club in the history of Brazilian football

In reality, this fucking team is the clubification of the word failure.

It sucks that Atlético won't take off, and until the last round there will be sequelae that sees the team failing for 41 years believing in the title. They don't learn this shit.

And I get pissed that people think it's only Renato's fault, Flamengo had 300% possession of the ball in the first half and 79 shots on goal.

Our life will be like this shit, beating Vasco and taking 3rd place in the Brazilian Championship until we die. Whoever saw it last year saw it, man, it's over.

And what pisses me off the most is knowing that even with this shitty football, this shit dressed in red and black will qualify for the next 7 Libertadores, and every year I will be forced to watch this trash be eliminated by an Independiente de la Chupeta or a The Scrumblest from Bolivia.

Then comes Paranaense saying ""oh, but that was a lack of respect for Atlétic"". Come on, man, with all due respect, you take the APAE team in the Teleton and put them against Atlétic today, and you'll have a game.

But it wasn't even about losing to Atléhthich-PR, a classic is a classic; it was about having it happen the way it happened, it was about having it happen the way it always happens: farting, opening up, shaking things up.

First goal, Felipe Luiz kicked the leg of the generic Atlétic striker for no reason, in the second Isla gave a cut to the generic Atlétic striker

Fuck, you say such truths, Mr. Adeílton, a drunkard, comes and says that you are a fad. A fad is the head of my ball, good night**



**A SEGUNDA PRATELEIRA**



2.0 **I am 22 years old and I am a Vasco fan. The history of my team, since I was born, has been, for the most part, one of hard defeats. The funniest thing about all this is that my love only blossomed as the difficulties increased. As I learned more about Vasco, more about its historical importance, the team began to have more meaning for me. Today, I see that, above all, I am a Vasco fan. My team is the main trait of my personality. I wake up, I think about Vasco. I go to bed thinking about Vasco.

In fact, one of the main regrets I feel about having come to build my life in another city is precisely the geographical distance I have in relation to my team, so I think about returning to Rio as soon as possible, so I can fully experience the experience of supporting the Giant Of The Hill

That said, it has not been easy. My love grew in the difficulties, but they brought an immense burden of regrets and sadness. Especially considering the recent campaigns of our biggest rival, who swept the continent with overwhelming football. 

Now, I see a different perspective: in the first two rounds of the Brasileirão, Vasco took four points from two of the four strongest teams in Brazil. I'm not fooling myself, I'm not expecting a title campaign, but my heart is very excited with the idea that this first season of our new phase will be calm, without any major scares, which for Vasco fans already means a lot. I can indeed see my team once again starring in great campaigns at a national and international level, worthy of its history. 

Today, Vasco managed to plant in my heart one of the most beautiful feelings a human being can experience: hope.**

2.4 **Little Dig - Holy Shit, how Little Dig plays football, he deserves to be selected for the national team a long time ago, since his time at Putfire. A defensive midfielder who plays football with incredible ease. He marks a lot, supports the attack well, shoots, hardly misses a pass, no one gets past him and, on top of that, he scores on the ball. He saves Florminense on many counterattacks, he has a cunning and can see where the player is who can receive the pass and surround him, if the guy touches him he stretches his foot and recovers the ball, if the guy tries to dribble he steals it.**

2.8 **In my second year of elementary school, a kid in my class put his foot in front of me and made me trip in front of the girl I had a crush on. I literally cried of anger that day. I went home and spent hours planning my revenge. I barely slept that night. The next day, I covered the chair he was sitting in with glue. He realized it about 2 minutes after sitting down and started crying because he thought he had shit himself. I went to the principal's office and got a warning, but I will never forget the total satisfaction I felt when I saw the little girl I had a crush on laugh at him for making a fool of himself. I cherish that memory.

Do I regret it? No, because it lifted a weight off my shoulders. It was the only time in my life that I felt mortal hatred for someone... until today. What I regret is not being able to get revenge on Deyverson on the same level and having to carry that hatred with me to the grave. What a son of a bitch player.**

2.10

**Vasco is the new worst team in the world, the referee blows the whistle to start the match and 1 second later we concede a goal. The training sessions must be worse than Corinthians' training sessions when The Rabbit was in charge of the team, it's not possible that Vasco is on all fours against Ceará

**FOR CEARÁ**

# CEARÁ IS THE REAL MADRID IN VASCO'S EYES!!!

I know I should have realized this a loooooong time ago, but it's the end of Rio of January football. In 5 years, only Flame n' go will remain.  Putfire no longer exists, it's just a matter of time before Florminense leaves the G6, I don't even need to talk about Vasco, right? I give up, the fourth relegation is coming. Forget about Thursday's game, we'll get our ass kicked by Defense And Justice. I'm going to start rooting for América Miner, which is MUCH better than rooting for Vasco.

Ribamar scored a goal while I was typing. It would have been better if he hadn't missed the penalty, or I would have written an entire book badmouthing this team that thinks that Série A is all about street football.

Forget it, Ceará scored another goal. COME ON, BIG RABBIT!!!**



**A TERCEIRA PRATELEIRA**




3.0 **

While following the sub, a question came to me: am I the only one who has played soccer in an organized way without playing naked with friends?

like half of the comments I see here are obviously written by non-athletes, which is almost comical.

When I played for Ypiranga's under-17 team (3 years as a starter) I ran faster than anyone. The team's coaches called me the Falcon of the Pampas, a nickname I earned due to my talent and during those three seasons we were the most feared full-back in the under-17 Gaucho team. In my last year we reached the semi-finals of the state championship but were fucked by the referees in the 43rd minute of the second half, but that's another subject (send me a private message if you're interested in knowing more)

So yes, I hope you can understand why I feel such a disconnect with the redditors on this sub. Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way lol**





3.1 **I'm still the one to blame???**





3.2 **The kids are all excited about Liverpool and Salah's brilliant season, but I'm here to bring some sporting reason to the group. Any result other than Manchester City's victory in Anfield today will be a surprise. The blue team is superior in practically every position, has had an excellent season and has as its backbone this young man in the image, the brilliant Kevin de Bruyne, who has had a season at least on par with the Egyptian who wears red. So, measure your euphoria with the reds so you don't fall off your horse. In the land of the Beatles, Oasis will triumph.**

3.5 **Vasco will win the Libertadores in 2025 if Putfire wins this year

You may find it strange, but just look at the logic:
Of the 4 big teams in RJ, in 2022 Flame n' go won the Freepains, in 2023 it was Flcumcincencsec's turn, but now that I noticed, we've already had 2 Rio of January Libertadores champions in 2 years, and this year PUTFIRE is in the quarterfinals,

First Flame n' go, then Fluminense, and now it's Putfire who is in a good phase
And it's worth remembering that always a year before Fla and Flu won the Freepains they were already in a good phase, in 2023 Putfire is in a good phase, Vasco is in a good phase currently (not in a very good phase, but they're in the quarterfinals of the Copa do Brasil, doing well in the Brazilian league)
So, I believe that if Putfire wins the Libertadores this year, not only will we have 3 consecutive Rio de Janeiro Libertadores champions, but there are also  chances of Vasco winning the Libertadores in 2025

And I'm not kidding, this could really happen if you follow this logic**





3.6 **I know that a large part of Flame N' go's fans started supporting them in 2019, so I'll explain it to you: Flame n' go is just like that. It has always been a joke in all competitions. It has been eliminated in a retrospective way several times and lost the final to Saint  Andre 3000. This team is a joke.**




3.7 **A matter of respect

Yes, I know this post doesn't make sense, after all, joking around is part of football, but I think this time it's kind of unnecessary. I was reading a post about Flamengo's mascot being named José Roberto Wright and I noticed a comment asking if Atlético was Botafogo de Minas. So far so good, I could tell the joke was in the comment, but there was a comment there from a guy (whose name I won't reveal) saying that Botafogo at least provided good players to the national team, which is true, but for me it started to go downhill when he changed the subject and said that Atlético won the Libertadores in a shitty way, facing 3 teams that were bad. For those who were Atlético fans in 2013, you know how hard it was and I've heard stories of rival fans even rooting for Galo, but of course, our friend's club-oriented mindset makes us think that Atlético was horrible in the Libertadores just because they faced Olimpia in the final, but of course we'll ignore the fact that Olimpia has already been to the final 7 times. Another thing he said is that players like Marcos Rocha, Jô and Bernard were Galo idols, and I counter that with my opinion, which is that Marcos Rocha wasn't a good full-back, at most better than Guga, everyone knew that Jô was a party animal, so I at least looked at him with a sideways eye and Bernard wasn't bad, but he wasn't great. At least for me, it seems that few from 2013 became idols, such as Vitor, Ronaldinho and Léo Silva (in my opinion), and others who participated but shined later, like Dátolo if I'm not mistaken. Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's bad that we were compared to Botafogo, I even think this comparison is good when it comes to titles, but I'm surprised by how people in this sub can just belittle a team that isn't bad just out of hate or something like that. And before you ask me, I didn't think the '81 game was stolen, but rather mistaken.**

3.10 **Is Botafogo Arsenal Of South America? (Sorry For English)

I watched South American football ever since Suarez played for Gremio and when I saw Botafogo and researched them, they have similarities with Arsenal 

Both No Copa Libratadors/Champions League 
Both Bottle The League in 2023 
No League Title For 20+ Years 
Both Play in Famous Cities Rio De Janeiro/London 

To All My Brazilian Friends are Botafogo disrespected by the media and other club fans like Arsenal?**

4.1 **Courage, Big Felipe! The midfield of Germany does not mark much. William scale. Let the three steering wheels play. Play without fear. Like Brazil ...**




4.2 **England is gigantic and it's crazy of you to say that Croatia or Uruguay are bigger. A giant country obsessed with football with the biggest league in the world. Uruguay is a tax haven that won the first World Cup ever when nobody cared about football yet and then in 1950 that only had guests because the war had just ended against a Brazil that played with a hangover because it celebrated before time. Croatia is a buffer state that was born in a war that had nothing to do with it in the 90s and eliminated Brazil by luck and defensiveness, reached the final in 2018 because it literally had no opponent and suffered its first defeat in a final (just as it was humiliated by Argentina right after eliminating us, it was supposed to be 5) in decades, in 1998 it got lucky because it had a player from the former Yugoslavia. It doesn't matter if England has been in a drought of titles for decades or if Brazil is a mess, the greatest will always be these, along with Italy, Germany, Argentine, Spain, football is a cultural thing that transcends performance, it travels around the world and people will remember Lampard, Ronaldinho, Rooney, Shearer, Lineker, Bald, Zico, Romario, Kaka, not Rakitic and Valverde, Suarez and Modric are the exceptions that prove the rule

ps: it is also bigger than the Netherlands, it doesn't matter if the Netherlands won the Euro, or was important for football, etc., it had some stars and great teams, but it's like comparing Atlhéthic-PRH with Putfire, they can win a title and be more organized, but in H even with memes and jokes the reaction will be much greater to a game of firegão**

**The strawberries won't win
Not another title in this life
They only lose!
Super Grêmio is awesome, bringing us joy
There's Brenno, DC and Little Rafa

And of course, there's also Ferreira
Diego Souza and Thiago
Who play better than the Colorados
And it's like Maicon says
Do you know a guy called Golden?
Who is Golden? Who is Golden?
Tell me who is Golden? Golden? Golden?

And to brighten up our week
We are laughing at the Colorado
Another title won
Four-time state champion
And Little Rafa who attracts trophy, trophy, trophy
Where is Rafita, you are trophy, trophy, trophy
NOTE-G Parodies, original
It is the Grêmio
Biggest in the South

Douglas Costa is going to play
But he hasn't even debuted yet
Anxiety
Sadness will set in, over there by the Guaíba
They are lost in life

They won't win any more trophies
Not even the state title
Poor Colorado
They must be all confused
Seeing Grêmio winning again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again

Rafinha and Diego Souza
They played a heavy pagode
They made fun of the Colorado
And Yuri Alberto, poor guy

And we are going to have a minute of silence for the Colorado
The poor guys died again, the biggest Grêmio in the state

Yeah, it didn't work out again
Another Gaucho title
Super Grêmio is formed
It's the Gu-Laugh**



4.4 **If Veiga was Argentine and his name was Yeferson Ramirez and he scored goals with the brim of his cap, in addition to knowing where the H afletico paranaense is, could he be considered one of the greatest idols of merden bosten?**




4.5 **

Professor Mano, I just read the press conference you gave. Once again I saw an honest and courageous man in front of the camera. I was very sad to see that human beings are often cruel without limits. I had this feeling when I heard the journalists ask you about your debt to the Dickmeiras fans. And you, despite suffering more than anyone else there, with all the humility that is typical of you, gave a very coherent answer. Congratulations. You are a great man and a unique human being. Of course, Professor, I, like the other Red Blacks, are celebrating another result, but I know that no one loses by choice. My email is just to thank you for the great happiness that you and your group have brought to our nation. Good work in the coming years. I am sure that you will lead with extreme competence. They say that women do not understand football, but you understand human beings. Therefore, I send a hug with all my love to you and your entire team. May God be with you. Remember that a dream may last for a night, but joy comes in the morning. With this quote, I want to say that everything will pass and everything will be fine. Know that, like me, there are many people who are following this team that has the privilege of being led by you. Receive a hug from an anonymous Red Black, who doesn't know much about football, but who really admires your work.""**







4.6 **You know, my fan... Furadog has always taken care of you. It gave you joy, great victories. It made Arena of the lowlands home. And in a family, we support each other, right? That's why I'm calling you now... no, I'm inviting you, to give back.

Buy the ticket, go to the stadium, cheer. It doesn't have to be an obligation. It's just respect, you know, a family respects, takes care of each other. I've done a lot for you, and now, I ask for something simple: your presence. Doesn't Furadog deserve that?

But listen... if you think you can stay home, that you'll ignore the call, I'm not going to say that I'll be able to accept it. And I'm patient, but only up to a point. If you don't show up, I'll come to you.

I'll pick you up, take you to the Arena. With the shirt, the cap, and you'll cheer... any sign of weakness will not be forgiven.

Here, either you put on the mantle and support... or we'll have a more... personal conversation. Because at Furadog, there is no shortage of true fans. Remember: family is like this. And I hope you are on the right side.**







4.7 **Do this or nothing, and this is my warning to Corinthians, Palmeiras, Flame n' go... If we don't do something, we'll wake up in 70 years, under the current management structure, with the people who are here today, Bahia will win the Brazilian Championship 17 out of every 20 years.

— I love the people at Manchester City, the people who work there are incredible. But the fact is that Brazil brought oil money home. If we don't do something now about a salary cap, Bah Island will eat our lunch. That wonderful city [Savior], great hotel, great food, perfect. They'll win every championship for 20 years in a row. I'm sorry to say this to the Flame n' go fans out there. Forget it, it's over, it's over. We need to fix this now. The League has to be done now, the salary cap too.

— They're Abu Dhabi. We have to compete against Qatar [PSG] in France. I'm competing with a country, not an owner. A model of unbridled spending, without restrictions. As long as they can generate enough revenue, and they can because of their relationships with Qatar and sponsorships. Then they can put the revenue exactly where they need it, to spend what they want because they want to win the UEFA Champions League.

— I have to compete with that as the owner of one of the great clubs in France, which was national champion seven times in a row between 2000 and 2008. Now, that club, the great Olympique Lyonnais, can't compete for anything other than second place. We're going to do our best, hopefully kick their asses and have a bad year. But all they have to do is reach into their pockets, release some oil money and I'm done.**






4.8 **The Carioca will take the place of the Dicklista

In a few years, the Carioca will take the place of the Paulista

It's no secret that the Paulista has become the epicenter of national football because of money. They simply started hiring the best players in Brazil, consequently attracting the attention of the country. Until then, they never had rivals when it came to competing for players. That was until the moment that the Cariocas realized that football is a market that moves a lot of money.

Five years ago, no one took the Carioca seriously. Now they have made more impressive signings than the Paulista, because they know how to play the game. They have already made it clear to the players that they can pay.
More than any team from São Paulo, they are now making it clear to football fans that they are fairer and take the fans' opinions more seriously than the Paulista.

If they continue at this pace, I have no doubt that by 2030 the Carioca will become the largest state championship in Brazil.**






4.9
**""We need to talk about Marco Reus. This guy has been at Borussia Dortmund for over 19 years. Ever since he was a kid, when he played soccer with apples and tangerines that his mother bought at the market, he dreamed of being a black and yellow player. He played for 10 years in the club's youth teams, but was dismissed because he was considered too thin. For many it would be a step backwards, but for him it was fuel. A boost. Ironically, the skinny kid had never been so hungry: hungry for the game. Curiously, he had never eaten so well: eating the ball. So, climbing the ladder one step at a time, coming from the German 3rd division, he made his favorite team correct the mistake it made and re-sign him in 2012. Since then, he has played 317 games, scored 141 goals and scored 99 assists. He turned down Bayern Munich, Barcelona, ​​Manchester City, and was cut from the 2014 World Cup when he was the best player The active German player has suffered several injuries, lost titles and opportunities, but never lost his love for his team. At a time when athletes claim to be fans but at the first sign of adversity they put the institution in second place and money in first place, Marco Reus acted differently. He could have seen himself as just another victim whose career was marred by injury, but no. With each setback, when everyone thought he would succumb, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, he rose again. Mario Götze, Lewandowski, Aubameyang, Sancho, Dembélé and Gündogan left, Reus stayed, but he didn't stay at Borussia, he stayed in the history of Borussia. And when he retires, he may not have all the titles he would like, but he will have the respect and idolatry. He will be immortalized in the hearts of a fan base that brings 80 thousand people to the stadium every season, and that, my friend, no amount of money in the world can buy or pay for.""**























4.10 **Guys, calm down. You travel too much, really too much. Let's think about it for a moment, please?

I like and comment on photos of beautiful women on Instagram/Twitter because they are potential followers, since I find them on soccer profiles. The goal is for them to follow us back. I like and comment on all photos of people who like soccer. On photos of dogs I comment ""so handsome"", on photos of people who want to be soccer players I say ""fly boy!"", on stupid photos ""lol"" and so on. On photos of beautiful women I say ""top"" or ""awesome"" and sometimes they follow back.

Think about it a little and understand that if I stop following/commenting/liking ""beautiful girls"", we will be losing a lot of potential followers too. But if you all want our social networks to be exclusive to men, make a thread proposing the suggestion there, and we will discuss it.

If anyone wants, go to Instagram and Twitter and count how many % of the people I follow are women. Let's think and use our heads a little, guys. It's not difficult, you just have to stop and think about how to gain followers.

Anyway, that's it.**



**A QUINTA PRATELEIRA**






5.0 **Here's the thing, I know that the fun of football is making fun of other people's dicks, I know it's cool and all, but this is going too far, was it humiliating for Cruzeiro to concede a goal from a Saci? Yes, these amateur players deserve to be made fun of, but making fun of CRUISE, I repeat, CRUISE goes too far, they can make fun of that cuckold Ramón, but not the intuition of Cruise Sport Clube, I find it minimally ironic that whoever is making fun of my team here is more screwed than we are, to start with there's a Vasco fan, there's not much to say, this shit has already been relegated four times, it doesn't have any recent relevant titles, their only joy is beating Flame n' go, who was training with the pathetic Vasco, then there's an Internacional fan, they don't know what it's like to win the Brazilian championship for over 40 years, this shitty team was in the B series not long ago, the second strongest team in their state, and they still want to make fun of the king of the Brazilian Cup, there's no way around that, then comes a Corinthians fan, who is so screwed that he has to celebrate ""Paulistinha day"", who cares about the state championship, man, Corinthians, apparently they're going to have to take it another goal from Arrascaeta in the final of the Copa do Brasil to learn from, celebrating Paulistinha Day is pathetic, but after all that's what they got left, the Palmeiras fan there is the least bad, he's in a good phase and everything, but I think that instead of worrying about the shit of a Happy Landing x Cruzeiro, he should worry about his team's recent defeats, with Abel Ferreira's defensive and fearful football, anyway that's what I wanted to say**

5.1I met Ronaldinho at Sambola?!
He was there with another friend.
I was furious when I saw him, because the guy only cares about partying and has never had anything to do with soccer. That's when I said: Where's the soccer, Little Ronaldo? You only care about partying, you're not playing shit, you know...
He looked scared and immediately said: Who are you to tell me that, my friend? Have some respect.
I said: Where's that Ronaldinho that people were used to seeing? Unfortunately, I think soccer is ending for you, Little Ronaldo. You don't even make a difference anymore. You've become just a normal player.
He looked at me and I immediately saw tears running down his face. He came up to me and said: Do you really think that of me, kid?
I said, also with tears in my eyes: No, Ronaldinho, I know you're the man. Go out there and finish them off on Wednesday. Take care, okay?
He was crying, gave me a hug and said: Don't worry, Wednesday is my day. I'm going to bring joy to the nation...
He implied that Wednesday he saw the game end.

Early forties (I'm twenty-nine), great smile, very kind eyes. We've been chatting for about a week or two and decided to link up for coffee.

The conversation was so natural and relaxed 😌 we were both picking up on good vibes from the other. At one point he leans in really close to talk to me, I lean in really close to match him, giving him slight puppy dog eyes and looking up at him. Y'all, the way he got stunned/lost in my eyes and forgot what he was taking about haha ya girl's discovering the power she has over ppl and I really really like it.

He goes ""sorry haha, uhm I just got kind of... distracted. Ur eyes are absolutely stunning,  btw.""

I say ""haha thank u, I like urs, too,"" and just look at him like this 😏

After a moment of hesitation, he leans in closer and plants one right on urs truly 💋🤭 then another, then a few more ☺️

He asks, ""I don't mean to be presumptuous, but if u wanted to hang out more, my apartment is right up the street.""

Jackpot lol

I understand that, if they were to have listened to the community from the start, Arc would've failed long time ago.

My name is Sean.

I’m 40 years old 🎉

I’m Scottish! I was born in Scotland, moved around the world a little bit through education and work etc and I’ve come back to live in my little hometown.

I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

It’s not unusual to find me deep inside a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

In what very little spare time that I have, I like to go to the gym. I seen someone post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that with someone too. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

Recently I've found that it would be fun to meet new people or engage in new activities to broaden my horizons during my free time. I'm all about trying new things to see if it suits me.

I'm a grad student in biology and a lot of my time is spent in the field, labs, or doing research at random hours of the day. But apart from that I like to spend my time finding new ways to engage with all that's out there. I'm looking for friends who have similar interests or even different interests who might want to share them with someone. From cultural knowledge, games, books, stories, gardening, and more.

**About Me**

**Films & Anime** 

I have always been a fan on films and the value they hold, one of my all time favorite films is 12 Angry Men, it's a classic I would say in many ways, I hope you find some time to watch it! Roman Holiday is a great one as well on top of things like Schindler' List, The Pianist, Gladiator, and many more. I recently watched a film called Time Still Turns The Page, and I think it's a wonderful film by Nick Cheuk (2023). These are some examples but I do enjoy genres like Slice of Life, Thriller, Intrigue, Fantasy (LoTR, etc), and anything with a beautiful story.

I've been watching anime since I was a kid as well and have seen a so many series I've lost count. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Kids on the Slope are on my all time favorite along with so many more. Mangas, oh man, it feels like I've read them all, but surely that can't possibly be. Bersek, Vagabond, Fairy Tail, One Piece, I mean this list would be too big. I enjoy most genres in this topic.

Happy to take recommendations!

**Games / Video Games / Table Top Games**

I do play video games and I have been since I was a kid. My all time favorites are those with impactful stories such as Baldur's Gate 3, The Last of Us, The Witcher, Final Fantasy (6, 7, 8 and more), Cyberpunk, Pathfinder, and more. But its not exclusive to those, I also enjoy other types of games like Space Marines 2, or Valheim, Minecraft, etc.

I do play a lot of tabletop games, I began playing D&D asa kid and have been a DM for just about 8 years now. This also includes games like Vampire: The Masquerade, Board games like Catan, Munchkins, and more. I'd be up for some party play in D&D or Baldur's Gate, could be fun. If you're a DM or enjoy D&D we'd probably get along.

**Music**

I grew up with music in my life, I went to a school that promoted fine arts among its normal course load. I have performed across the world for various international platforms but no longer have the time to do so, its been a a few years since I picked up my instruments. I play clarinet, trumpet, sax, and piano.

I absolutely love jazz music and its the core of my music foundation along with classical and orchestral. The freedom of expression is what really attracts me. But then again, I also listen to pop, kpop, artists like Coldplay, Maroon 5, to Michael Bolton, and much more. I enjoy a whole range of genres and music but really love these jazzists; Art Blakey, Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Bill Evans, Louis Armstrong, the list goes on.

**Science**

This is a big part of who I am too. At the core, I'm an engineer and biologist. I keep tabs on the latest innovations and participate in events across the globe for synthetic biology and how it might shape the future. Science journals like [Cell](https://research.com/journal/cell), [Nature Ecology and Evolution](https://research.com/journal/nature-ecology-and-evolution), [Frontiers In Marine Science](https://research.com/journal/frontiers-in-marine-science) are all great places to learn and discover about the world. [iGEM](https://igem.org/) is a great place to learn about synthetic biology especially for highschool and university students who want to engage themselves and their communities.

**Other Hobbies**

I'm a hobby writer. I've been writing a fantasy novel for a few years now that has been made into a tabletop game. It's being played as a DnD campaign with two separate parties of 2 and 3 years running. I enjoy getting up early and training at the gym next door, coffee in its freshest forms, I've taken a liking to cooking in the last 3 or 4 years and enjoy dabbling with recipes, books such as The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Feed, A Wizard of Earthsea, The Way of Kings, and more.  
  
With all that being said, it's nice to meet you. If we don't ever connect, then at least you've been left with a few things to explore on your own. If we do meet, then the pleasure is all mine and I hope you can tell me more about yourself too.

I've been at college for a few semesters, and found a club that really interests me. I met this girl who initially talked to me and said I should join the club. I did, and its been great! A little while after joining, she sent me a text asking if I'd wanna get coffee sometime, and that she wanted to get to know me. I was kind of taken aback, since I'm not used to people so openly being interested in me. I'm usually pretty shy to folks I don't know that well, and having someone I don't know that much ask me out so blatantly was unusual for me.
Before we met up, my heart was racing for the usual reasons. A pretty girl asked me out, I was losing it! As soon as I arrived, all of my nerves vanished into thin air, and we had a nice time talking about our interests/majors and what not. What really messed me up though is that I didn't really feel anxious at all. No butterflies or knots in my stomach, but no giddy feeling of overexcitement either. I'm usually a very anxious person, so the sudden lack of noise from my head or heart felt very unique. I'm having a hard time decerning whether I was just particularly at peace being around her, or if what I was feeling was the lack of feelings for her.
The biggest issue in this whole situation is that I've had problems with crushing on people in the past. I've never really been in a proper relationship before, and the times I have managed to get into one is because the other person said they liked me, and so I gaslit myself into believing that I liked them too, which ultimately hurt everyone involved. 
This girl is so sweet, kind, beautiful and silly, and I don't want to ruin our friendship so far or hurt her emotionally just because I couldn't figure out my feelings. 
I've been trying really hard to figure out as much on my own as I can, but I need an outside opinion. Do I have a crush on this person? Is my subconscious trying to tell me I don't like them, and is trying to avoid repeating my past mistakes? Please help!",1,1730248111.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Do you often feel *short and stout*? Are you just standing around, waiting for someone to shout, “Tip me over and pour me out”? Ever wonder if your handle is on the right and your spout on the left, or maybe vice versa? 

Introducing the Teapot Identity Test™! 

Our state-of-the-art, 5-minute assessment will dive deep into whether you're just someone with a handle and a spout—or if there's more going on beneath the surface than meets the eye. Using high-tech seal analysis and lid-to-pot handle clinking, we’ll reveal once and for all whether you’re a casual kettle, a regular old coffee pot, or a full-blown *teapot in denial.* 

Symptoms May Include:
- A strong urge to steam up rooms
- Sudden, unexplainable desire to crack 
- Deep confusion about whether or not you’re meant to be a teapot in the first place
-being frequently too hot to touch

So, are you a little teapot? Find out today! Because sometimes, the biggest question isn’t about pouring out. It’s about pouring **in** to yourself.

Now that the pandemic has been over for a couple years, what is the typical amount for gratuity and when is it appropriate? Fees & gratuity have increased because of Covid but should we still tip the same amount as we did during Covid?

I’m seeing higher percentages now, ie 20% being the lowest, then 22%, 25% and even 30%. 

I went to Pret this morning and for the first time the cashier turned around a “tip screen”. I’m grabbing by sandwich from the shelf, bringing it to the cashier and then taking it away. I didn’t tip.

Do you tip for take away coffee? If so, how much? 

What do you tip at restaurants now? For Uber & Cab drivers? Cleaning service? Grocery delivery? Food delivery? Estheticians? Massage therapists? Bar tenders? Fast food like Sweetgreens? And of course, restaurant servers when sitting in? 

Just want to get an idea of what the average amount has been lately.

I am 22M and dating a girl that is also 22. We dated for 1 year and 9 months and then broke up for 6 months and then she reached out again about 2 months ago and we've been dating again since. She has borderline personality disorder and things get really scary sometimes. I'm writing this because yesterday and today got really really bad and I don't know exactly what to do. Yesterday midday we were supposed to nap together and I fell asleep by mistake and she got really mad and I was at my family's home and she got so mad she ubered to the place even though I begged her not to. She slammed on the door for a while while I rushed to get ready (nobody else was home) and eventually I got outside and I said I'll drive her home and so we started driving and she got really upset at me and started screaming at me for leaving her outside and she just kept screaming and I started breaking down. I pulled over in some parking lot and she kept screaming at me and I started recording her on my phone because I was getting scared and she would keep wrestling the phone from me kind of violently. And she did it like 4-5 times saying it made her uncomfortable to film her. Eventually we started driving home (I offered to pay for her return Lyft multiple times) and she started kicking and hitting my car and eventually I drove to her apartment and she kept screaming and eventually poured coffee in my cup holders and then wouldn't leave my car and would only go back to my place. So we did and she went back and eventually calmed down and took an edible and was nice I guess in the evening.

Then this morning I was so upset I said I wanted to break up when driving her back to her apartment and she ended up ripping all the papers I had in my glove box (like insurance and registration and ripped all the pages out of my car manual). Then she calmed down and I drove us to get food and she calmed down a bit and idk now she's back at my place but not doing well emotionally.

I'm just scared and tired and I don't really know what to do or what to say or how to deal with her. I love her but I don't think I should be treated like this. And I am just so sad. She needs to be babied right now (hug her and reassure her I love her while she cries) but I can't keep doing that. And she did some nice things today. Even when she wasn't feeling good today she offered to pick up my medicine and also bring me some food. So it's like when she is feeling somewhat ok she is nice but also when she isn't she is really really mean to me.

I guess I know this behavior is wrong. But she keeps asking for help and idk what to do.",1,1730247590.0,abusiverelationships,0,1.0,False

Espresso was coming out undrinkable, and was only bearable with enough steamed milk to almost dilute the bitterness. Didn't want to take another chance on a replacement and risk the same occurrence after another 2 months. At first, shots were pulling fine, but it gradually declined. I liked the machine, extremely easy to use, but we feel that in trying to become a ""Jack of all trades"", it sacrifices too much quality. 

My wife prefers drip coffee, and everyone has different taste, so opinions are subjective, but the drip coffee had the taste and texture of a Mr Coffee drip maker poured hours after it was made. We played with the grind settings, the temp settings, the ratio. We would ignore the BA advisement of 25 grind, and adjust to 22, for a somewhat acceptable black coffee from your favorite all night diner. The cold brew was fine, but hard to simulate the same depth and taste that a proper cold brewed coffee from your favorite shop. The espresso started off as acceptable, and we mostly would either make a flat white, or cappuccino, and that was fine until it just became too blah and bitter.

The machine probably needs to be adjusted or is defective, but it doesn't give me much confidence. I know we only had it for 2 months, but it never prompted us to clean it. Although the clean up and maintenance was, for us anyway, very easy, but we're used to daily maintenance. The drip tray does need constant draining, but no deal breaker, this machine goes through a lot of water. The ""add beans"" light never came on, and twice the hopper actually was empty. I don't know, in theory, this machine will probably be ready in another future version or an updated model, but for us, safer to go back to the old french press and Fellow Ode grinder. This could be a catalyst for creating some new machines that will take this a step further and elevate the SA game.

I did about 97% of barbri. I did around 400 MBE questions on adapti bar. I made outlines and giant posters I plastered all over my living room. 

I seriously thought I failed. Not an anxious ""oh i failed."" But just did not think i did well both days. 

  
I did not sleep. I woke up at 4AM after not being able to sleep all night. I did not eat well. I lived off of coffee and barely had water both days. (I was too anxious). 

  
First day, I ran out of time half way through my second MPT; MEES were a shit show. I made up so many of the questions (don't remember how many) but I made sure to write something, even if its a made up law, for each question and did an IRAC analysis  (or at least tried to. not sure if I actually did). 

  
Second day, first half, I missed the last ten questions on the MBE. TEN questions. I was horrified. I cried throughout lunch break. The second half was hard and my vision blurred and I just could not comprehend anything. I guess on at least 20 questions during the second half. 

  
I walked out confident I failed. I did not do enough real bar questions, i practiced about 4-6 MEES for each subject (not as many as others usually do), and did about 6-8 MPT (not all of them were under exam mode) 

  
I found out I passed last week. I honestly still don't know how. But don't lose hope. I know DC and CA folks are waiting. This exam makes us feel so inadequate and it is really hard to assess your performance. Good luck folks! ",7,1730247173.0,barexam,0,1.0,False

I am 22M and dating a girl that is also 22. We dated for 1 year and 9 months and then broke up for 6 months and then she reached out again about 2 months ago and we've been dating again since. She has borderline personality disorder and things get really scary sometimes. I'm writing this because yesterday and today got really really bad and I don't know exactly what to do. Yesterday midday we were supposed to nap together and I fell asleep by mistake and she got really mad and I was at my family's home and she got so mad she ubered to the place even though I begged her not to. She slammed on the door for a while while I rushed to get ready (nobody else was home) and eventually I got outside and I said I'll drive her home and so we started driving and she got really upset at me and started screaming at me for leaving her outside and she just kept screaming and I started breaking down. I pulled over in some parking lot and she kept screaming at me and I started recording her on my phone because I was getting scared and she would keep wrestling the phone from me kind of violently. And she did it like 4-5 times saying it made her uncomfortable to film her. Eventually we started driving home (I offered to pay for her return Lyft multiple times) and she started kicking and hitting my car and eventually I drove to her apartment and she kept screaming and eventually poured coffee in my cup holders and then wouldn't leave my car and would only go back to my place. So we did and she went back and eventually calmed down and took an edible and was nice I guess in the evening.

Then this morning I was so upset I said I wanted to break up when driving her back to her apartment and she ended up ripping all the papers I had in my glove box (like insurance and registration and ripped all the pages out of my car manual). Then she calmed down and I drove us to get food and she calmed down a bit and idk now she's back at my place but not doing well emotionally.

I'm just scared and tired and I don't really know what to do or what to say or how to deal with her. I love her but I don't think I should be treated like this. And I am just so sad. She needs to be babied right now (hug her and reassure her I love her while she cries) but I can't keep doing that. And she did some nice things today. Even when she wasn't feeling good today she offered to pick up my medicine and also bring me some food. So it's like when she is feeling somewhat ok she is nice but also when she isn't she is really really mean to me.

I guess I know this behavior is wrong. But she keeps asking for help and idk what to do. ",2,1730247167.0,domesticviolence,2,1.0,False

I went to WH the other day and got a 12oz date-cardamom latte (their new holiday special, was very good) and it only came out to like $4.85 or something. Plus you don’t have to tip, which hate to say it as a past barista but it is nice tbh lmao. 


I used to actually work in the coffee bar at WH, and maybe it’s possible it was just a local thing at the one I worked at, but the drinks there really are a good deal. For espresso shots, they do 2 for a 12oz, 3 for a 16oz, and 4 for a 20oz. Most places do 2-2-3. For Americanos they do 3-4-5!! Which tbh was a little crazy, I would actually warn customers if they got a 20oz Americano since most people wouldn’t expect 5 shots. 


They also don’t charge for milk alternatives, which is pretty cool. And the brand of syrups there are actually pretty decent, no high-fructose corn syrup. All the produce used for juices/smoothies is the nice organic stuff that they sell in the store. Again, this could possibly be old/wrong info, I worked there before Covid so maybe they have made changes to save money or somethn.

Fast forward to July this year I was on the dating app again and we crossed paths but both our profiles were ambiguous and we did not realize it was each other until about a week of talking. We both got excited and immediately planned to meet and had a great sushi dinner date and getting to know one another. We had two more dates after and kept in touch by text. One thing that had bothered me for a bit even through the year we were social media friends was his horrible texting and he frequently apologized and acknowledged that he just is really really bad at texting and is this way with everyone. He showed me on his second date as a example a good friend of his living in another city who reached out almost a month ago that he just hasn’t found the time to sit down and get back to (he even said he might just call him instead of texting since again horrible texter). We had a long third date spending almost 18 hours together and ending up sleeping together (never had sex). But after a few days of texting at least once daily he stopped responding altogether on Wednesday. I sent a follow up text on Friday and by the weekend I realized I had just been ghosted. 

That weekend happened to be the state fair however and as fate would have it - I ran into him and he hugged me, acknowledged he knew what he had done and tried to reassure me that I did nothing wrong and that he was going through something and that he promised he would reach out to me and he hoped I would still reply.

Roughly 6-7 weeks pass and I don’t hear from him. He’s not very active on social media but i do see he celebrates with his friends his birthday in September. Early October comes and I notice that he is liking my Instagram stories and finally DM’s me in one of them. I text him and basically say hey can we talk and he responds and says he is down and we do meet. We meet at a coffee shop and start with small talk before I finally bring up getting ghosted and he says he is willing to go first and say his side. He basically tells me that he had been in a relationship the entire beginning of this year and had just broken up amicably with that person about 2 weeks prior to us bumping into each other in the app. He acknowledged that he did really like me and had a good time each and every moment but in the back of his mind he kept thinking about the other guy he really really liked until it came to that boiling point after the third date and he basically shut down emotionally and needed to isolate. I thank him for his side but reaffirmed my side that I was hurt by what he did and for not getting any answers for literally 2 months and he apologized. He thanked me for not blocking him and cutting him out of my life completely and expressed that he does not want to lose me as a friend. And goes on to say he wants to get to know me better as a friend and go from there.

I reciprocate and say that I would like that and he plans out two hang out sessions; the last one being going to the bars this last weekend for Halloween celebrations (Halloween being on a Thursday). Initially the plan was to meet his friends before going to the bars but as the night went on the plan morphed into him paying for my Uber to meet them at the bar instead and I only got to “meet” them for about 30 minutes before the group got splintered because of how crowded it was. I never saw him after that and realized he likely had left the bar already with his group and he hasn’t spoken to me since. I am very much confused because the last date a week ago he hugged me and expressed enjoying the time with me and texted me every few days but it just has not been the same as before. He very much gives avoidant vibes and I’m torn between being understanding of what he’s going through but also looking out for myself and continuing to live on. The dating community here is really small and the city even smaller that it’s inevitable we’ll bump into each other again and idk if I should confront him, wait for him to come back to me, or just totally give up altogether. In person he has always been very nice and kind to me and shared having to grow up independent but he works two jobs already snd is picking up a third job now too so part of me thinks his avoidant nature is leading him to just pack his schedule to avoid feelings. This is all very much a lot but figured I would share here and see peoples thoughts - thank you immensely also for those who make it here and read through my mini novel.

I’m set to graduate this December, and every single day is becoming a struggle. I work two part-time jobs, a lab tech job that averages 7-10 hours a week, and another as a soccer referee that has me running 10-20 miles a weekend.

I wake up tired, no matter how much sleep I get (I generally get 6-9 hours). I barely feel normal when I drink caffeine, generally not consuming more than a cup of coffee in the morning and an energy drink in the afternoon, usually less.

I recently cut down the hours at my lab tech job, but I don’t know if it’s enough. Work feels like a slog, I don’t feel close to my coworkers or my boss at all. I feel like I don’t ever have anything of substance to say to anyone, so I don’t want to chat with them.

Refereeing feels more stressful than usual, I broke down crying during a game for the first time ever in my 10 years of working as a ref.

Homework is miserable, focusing feels impossible, and once I actually get into studying I feel a deep sense of discomfort and the need to run away, so I procrastinate, which makes the problem worse.

I’m still passing all of my classes somehow, but I have no idea how. 

Hobbies and interactions with my partner and family have become more strained on my end. I feel irritable at the slightest things (but do my best to hide it), and sometimes talking to anyone makes me want to run off to who-knows-where even more.

I have discussed this with my partner, at least, and he has been very generous and forgiving with my lack of discussion about everyday things, but I sometimes (unfounded) worry that I will bore him.

The worst part is, is I can see the light at the end of the tunnel for this part of my life, and it should all be manageable, but I’m so freaking exhausted, mentally, physically, and emotionally, that I just can’t enjoy it. I can’t get excited about graduation or about moving somewhere new.

Some people suggested coop programs but they either take people under 25 or you have to know someone or get a 2 year diploma which I simply can't afford.

Is it too late to get into this career? I'm physically fit and healthy but my lack of blue collar experience is holding me back and my academic background seems to be more of a hinderance than the advantage I thought it would be.

During this time the flight attendant was sitting in the front and playing on his cell phone, simply ignoring what was happening in the cabin.  It was a short flight but prior to landing the flight attendant passed through offering a second beverage service.  He asked my husband if he’d like anything.  My husband was never once ride to the guy, after all accidents happen right? He responded “how about a coffee” (since he never got to drink the first cup).  Upon the flight attendants return to deliver the coffee, he approached with a very full cup and spilled some of it again on my husband.  At that point he and the other passengers just burst out laughing.  Another brief oh sorry muttered from the server and he walked off.  He returned saying he could give my husband 2500 miles or $25 for the issue.  My husband felt an apology was in order and didn’t receive one.  Then the guy said maybe I can do 5000 or $50.  He asked what my husband preferred and he replied either.  My husband got off the plane looking like he crapped his pants.  He was stained brown down his shirt, the front of his pants and through to the seat of his pants.  To date, no miles or $ certificate has been received.  He’s a 75k miler and he’s taking the advice of the 2 million miler who was seated next to him and going back to flying Delta. ",8,1730246300.0,AlaskaAirlines,10,0.64,False

I figured it has been a while since I suffered some real abuse from this sub, but I finally have something worth sharing and wanted to at least present my DD to you so the usual finance bros can pretend their casino is somehow different and more special than my casino.

\*\*Spoiler\*\* IT IS NOT

I am ready for the mindset of the immutable bros to come swinging their verbal daggers at me, so that SOME PEOPLE can read all of this and decide to ‘do their own research’  understanding this is NFA, but a presentation of facts to inspire them to see the opportunity right in front of their very eyes.

# **COLD HARD FACTS**

Kendu has been on a downward trend for sometime and while that is concerning to some number of investors and the uninitiated, the community has continued to work, shilling on all socials relentlessly. We have picked up a small portion of new holders in the recent weeks of this trend, sometimes stalling or being stuck in a range. The volume dropped to ‘indefensible’ levels, yet they were fairly consistent across the crypto memecoin boards. I was not worried.



I did NOT like any of it, but I had done enough research prior to buying to anticipate this was likely to happen. If you want to get life changing gains, 70-90% corrections are somehow the norm in this sick and twisted crypto memecoin world. Yes, clearly I love abuse and it must be something I never got enough of from various intimate partners before I settled down with one. I guess another failing in life of mine.

# **Due Diligence**

I come to you bearing gifts. The redistribution from whale holders has finally turned around. We are back to growing. And gaining new holders at a much speedier clip. See pic 6 compared to pic 4-Over 70 new holders gained since 6pm EST October 28th to about 6pm today (October 29th). Volume is a really great thing to track. Check pics 1-4. The volume has been hovering around 1 million for the last three days which was a clear signal the reversal had to be coming. I would have shared this sooner, but my normie job was busy and IRL stuff and I can’t keep spoon feeding the reality. We had a volume of 338K (across all DEXs and CEXs) on October 25th. The best and worst part is, I suspect that our volume could be close to 2 million right now and at least 1.5 million, worst being the Kendu Bot is going to be down for another 5 hours and I haven’t been able to stalk the metrics since this morning. 

[Pic 4 - 10\/29 Morn](https://preview.redd.it/8k5rl6m0asxd1.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a8cd2fe7f9fc5fe04558fa833d25893e899b5fb)

You can also check pic 5 to see the 2.36:1 buyers to sellers ratio. Point is the reversal is in. We had a massive rally today peaking around 68%. With the signs the market is giving and ETH making moves we stand a  strong chance of continuing this movement.

[Pic 5 - 10\/29 NOW](https://preview.redd.it/yp8bty15asxd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=da75a5aa63e70b86cf2acffcdc0ea47df183c5ce)

New buyers will help to increase the Kendu volume while likely putting some extra change in your pocket. This symbiotic relationship can be a win win for all. With more volume Kendu will be in pole position for more listings and we have the funds to do so in Miazaki’s wallet. You then have a choice to make:

Obviously, I can’t tell you what will happen, but when memecoins pump they really really pump and I think the metrics are screaming we aren’t done yet. What I would hope for is that People take this DD and do some research themselves and get involved. Maybe they will be so enamored with the result we will have some converts to the Kendu Army. You will then join the ranks from our official subreddit: r/kenduinu\_ecosystem 

The goal is to have holders join with conviction who are going to spread this movement to their friends, family, coworkers, healthcare professionals, randoms on the street, etc. That is how we continue to grow, not just in the echo chamber of socials. Our real world products will do some to help us (Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy drinks, jewelry, etc), but a real movement this cycle is going to require more work from more holders! One way or another see you at the top of Valhalla.

P.S. if you haven’t heard someone tattooed their pecker with Kendu Inu back in late September for the 1 billion Kendu competition ($44K in today’s price). Make a nice comment and I might share the X link…yeah there is video as it is VERY REAL.

I went to doctor who diagnosed me with fatty liver. But didn't really get much treatment options from doctor except lose weight and eat better advice which I have started to do. So far lost 5kg.

Until yesterday where I've realised I haven't eaten much and still getting pains.The main cause of these pains is coffee. As soon as I took a few sips it started. I usually have about 2-3 cups a day. 
Will be trying decaf from now on as I love my coffee but without the strong caffeine will see if it ends the sharp pains.

When my partner is on a work trip or at the office, I'm super productive - I clean the house, I'm efficient at my job and I just have this general feeling of being organized. BUT, when my partner is at home, even if we're both working I just can't do anything, all I want to do mind-numbing things like watch TV (not together!). It's also incredibly hard to focus on what I have to do, even if it's urgent. This is especially related to my job productivity, as everything else is not as pressing.

I'd say the fact that my partner is quite unorganized contributes to this, but I had previously very similar experiences with anyone that was in my space like roommates. It's just something about external presence (even if not in the same room or if no interaction is present) that triggers this. i.e I don't think intimacy or any romantic feeling is necessarily related, we've also been together for quite some time so the ""spark"" and madness of a new relationship are not at fault either.

Prior to this relationship, I would wake up earlier, would not do any of these things.

I'm working on setting some boundaries like choosing my own wake up time and not participating in a ""shared"" routine for the mornings but some of the time it just happens naturally and then my day is fucked. edit: this is not bulletproof, I haven't made it into a habit yet and it only works until they wake up, also this may sound easy on paper but it's SO INCREDIBLY HARD to actually pull off when living with someone.

I've also tried to isolate, like try to mind my own business with headphones on and stuff like that - doesn't work.

I just don't know what to do, it's really bothering me and I can't force my partner out of the house at all times (my job is fully remote) and I find it even more distracting to work in crowded spaces like libraries or coffee shops.

If you had a similar experience and/or know causes or some solutions, very much willing to hear any advice. Cheers.",10,1730245918.0,productivity,4,0.92,False

Yes, the man was still there across the street, head cocked intently towards the second story of the building.

And he was there an hour ago. And the hour before that. This afternoon he was in the lecture hall a few rows behind Michael. This morning, he was sitting in the corner of the coffee shop, having ordered nothing. The small, sunken eyes that dotted his pale face fell on Michael as soon as he entered. Until he uncomfortably shuffled out of the store, they never left for a second.

He left class early after spotting the man again, realizing he hadn’t seen him at this school before.

Now, about 9:30 in the evening, unmoving, the figure scanned the second-story windows. Michael lived alone, had no one in town to call and was confined to the apartment without a car. The police wouldn’t arrest a man in a clean button-down and slacks for standing on the sidewalk. He already tested that theory with an apathetic operator on the non-emergency line. The least he could do was get proof.

Making a crack in the blinds again, he raised his phone to the window and pressed the camera button. The auto-flash lit up as the photo was taken, and Michael dropped again, wincing at his mistake. No way he wasn’t spotted. *Located*.

Seconds later, the phone buzzed with call from a random number. He declined it. Another call buzzed immediately, and he blocked the number.

It felt like the walls themselves couldn’t keep him from being seen. The door was locked, but that didn’t make him feel any better. It was a cheap landlord-special door with questionable locks to match. Now 9:45 PM, the student sat beneath his window in the dark and waited in silence.

He sat there for 10 minutes. And 15 more. If the stranger was still there, Michael thought, he would run to one of the neighbors and explain the situation. That girl in 209 probably wouldn’t let in a random, panicked man at night. Maybe the old guy in 212…

But he didn’t even get to the door before he heard a pair of footsteps processing up the hall, slow-like. Each step found its way closer to his unit and, agonizingly, the doorknob started to rattle. There were weights on the terrified tenant’s feet, but the intrusion left him no choice but to call out in his shaky tone.

“I-I’ve already called 911… I have photos… I’m armed!”

Michael wasn’t armed. But the doorknob stilled. How the intruder responded snapped Michael out of his paralysis and left him perplexed.

On the other side of the door, there was the snap and whirring of a camera, accompanied by its light flashing through the cracks of the lousy door. The footsteps started back down the hall. When Michael checked the peephole, the stranger was on his way out, holding no camera.",2,1730245869.0,shortscarystories,0,0.75,False

I think it's embarrassing, but Faye insists that it's a mini dress, she bought it in the dress section of a nice boutique, so it's a dress.

I would classify it as beachwear - the sort of little dress you might slip over a swimming suit, lounge by a pool in, or wear hanging out at home. I don't think it was intended for walking in the park, having a coffee in a casual cafe, or going shopping, but that's how Faye is wearing it.

I pointed out that I was wearing a tee shirt over leggings, and my tee shirt was longer than her so-called ""dress"", because it covers my buttocks. She says the dress is not ""sexy"" but practical and comfortable, so it's not provocative to wear it in public. She said she would not wear a ""sexy"" mini dress meant for evening wear in the street, but this isn't.

I agree it isn't sexy or evening wear, it's shapeless and unflattering. I just don't think it's appropriate to wear in public. People snicker at her, and I feel humiliated on her behalf. She wore it to a bbq recently, and I could hear people saying things like, ""Oh look Faye's come without pants again.""

The last time I came to pick her up and she was wearing a tee shirt, knickers and sandals I told her to go put some pants on or I was leaving without her. She accused me of being old-fashioned and judgey.

If you want to relax or you are looking for something to help with pain, this might just be *it*.  

It’s not just the taste and effects, though—Bubba Kush delivers a high that lasts a solid 2-3 hours

**Bubba Kush Overview**

* **Type**: 100% Indica
* **Flavors**: Earthy, coffee, with a hint of chocolate (rich and smooth!)
* **Effects**: Super relaxing, sleepy, a bit euphoric—classic indica vibes
* **Best For**: Stress relief, insomnia, and pain management
* **THC Levels**: Around 18-22%, so it’s strong without being overwhelming
* **Duration**: Lasts about 2-3 hours, perfect for a long, mellow experience
* **Lineage**: A cross between Afghani and OG Kush
* **Main Terpene**: Myrcene (super chill vibes)

**Growing Tips I’m Picking Up:**

* **Setup**: Works well indoors or outdoors.
* **Temperature**: Loves 70-80°F.
* **Watering**: Keep it regular but let the soil dry out slightly between.
* **Humidity**: About 50-60% for veg, then down to 40-50% for flowering.
* **Light**: Needs plenty! 18 hours in veg, 12 hours in flower.
* **Nutrients**: Needs balanced nutes but more phosphorus and potassium during flowering.

Although I don't post or comment often, I am on Reddit quite frequently.

I have an offroad focused coffee company and I would really love to learn more about what we, OHV lovers, look for in coffee. I have done really well in my local area with my coffee trailer, but I really want to grow the online store (I know, coffee is flooded but that's for me to deal with). 

First, do you have any questions for me? 

Yes I offroad, my toys:

1974 Bronco - used for mild rock crawling and adventuring

Can-am X3 - used for everything (such a versatile rig)

2022 KTM 350 SXF



TL;DR  
Now to my questions:

1. Do you drink coffee? If so, what is your preference? 

2. Where do you get your coffee from?

4. How much do you spend on coffee a month? (if you are so willing to share)

5. How willing are you to buy coffee online? What keeps you from buying online? What would entice you to buy online?

6. Do you bring coffee camping/four wheeling, and if so what do you love/hate about it? What would you like to see?

6a. Are single serve coffee pouches (i.e. tea bags) appealing for on the go/outdoor excursions?

7. This is already a lot of time to take from you, but if there is any other input you are willing to share I would love to hear it

  
For those that respond, I appreciate the feedback and your time. I'm happy to talk about the company, our story, our mission, etc. but I don't want to break any rules so if you're that curious, feel free to DM me. If I get the all clear I will share more 'About Us'.",1,1730245508.0,Offroad,0,1.0,False

They could meet organically with lots of good matches instead of awkwardly over coffee with just one.

We usually end up close to the same number once his commission hits at the end of the year. 

**Day 1 Monday**

7:00 AM - Roll out of bed to make a morning Pilates class. (**$5.80** round trip). I stop by one of my favorite bakeries to pick up scones for M and I **$15.00** with tip. 

8:30 AM - I make coffee for M and I (pumpkin spice with oat milk for him, and a mocha protein coffee for me). We look over the calendar for the next month while we snack because we have a lot of guests and events coming up. He starts work but I rinse off and complete my morning routine before sitting down in my office. 

11:00 AM - I take a break from work to pull some gumbo I made last month from the freezer and start some rice. M is on zoom calls all day so I just leave a bowl for him on his desk so he can eat it whenever he’s finally off his on camera calls. I settle down in the office again to handle more emails and vendor due diligence. 

6:00 PM - Leave my apartment to head to the dentist. **$2.90** When I was 15, I was diagnosed with TMJ. Until now, I’ve been dealing with it by frequently replacing my retainers, not chewing gum, avoiding large sandwiches etc but this year a new challenger arrived. Migraines and they’ve been knocking me flat on my ass. Last week during my normal check up I brought up my new symptoms to the dentist. They also noticed my masseters looked even more pronounced than usual. Botox had been recommended to me in years previous but only now has the price seemed worthwhile. We sit down and discuss any possible side effects and what the long term treatment implications were. I told her I’ve reviewed all the articles she sent over and was good to go after reviewing and singing the waiver. While the actual injection was not painful the bill (that cannot be covered by my insurance or HSA) certainly was **$600.00(!!!!). $2.90** for the return trip home. 

9:00 - Home with M. He made some Ghia mocktails and grilled shrimp salad. He puts on *Rings of Power* in the bedroom but I fall asleep while reading *Mistborn*.

**TOTAL: $611.60**

**Day 2 Tuesday**

7:30 AM - Get up and head to work. (**$2.90**) The office manager greets me and mentions she’s ordered more of the matcha I like so we go to the pantry and I whisk up lattes for both of us while she updates me about the apartment she moved to. I procrastinated with her for a bit before heading to my desk and answering the emails that came in late last night.

12:30 PM - I’m momentarily distracted by the smell of the catered Thai food. There’s never enough pad see ew in my life so I’m thrilled. I bring my food back to my desk so I can redline more agreements and make note of different provisions for Finance, Compliance, and Ops to be aware of. I also get on a long zoom call with one of my friends in Compliance and we discuss this quarter’s goals for legal/compliance ops improvements but otherwise I don’t get a whole lot of pings and manage to work in relative peace today! I leave the office on time (**$2.90**).

7:50 PM - 1.5 hour long Korean class, and another week of wondering why I chose to take class so late in the day.  

9:30 PM - M made us salads with kale, slivered almonds, goat cheese, and sliced steak and we put on a WNBA game on in the background. M does the dishes as I review my Korean notes on the couch. 

**Total: $5.80**

**Day 3 Wednesday** 

5:00 AM - I wake up and head to Pilates (**$5.80** round trip). After my shower, I’m anxious to get some work done so I can be free all night to celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. I just brush my teeth and put on moisturizer before taking a seat in my office and reviewing all of the notifications. 

8:45 AM - I crush enough work that I finally feel comfortable making a matcha and getting through my full morning routine. Right as I sit back down with my caffeine in hand General Counsel cold zoom calls me asking if we can edit a letter I drafted for him live. 

10:30 PM - The zoom call turned 1.5 hour session where my boss was pulling people across departments in to get their input or flag certain sections of a large agreement that we’re trying to finalize. I can tell even my immediate supervisor, Associate Counsel, is getting worn down. But finally, we have been released so I try to knock out some other work. Around 11, my computer starts having issues. I’m troubleshooting it with IT over Slack but nothing is working so IT offers me a new computer but mentions if I want it before Monday I need to go to the office today. I tell him to prep the computer bc I’ll be there in 30 minutes! **$2.90**.

12:30 PM - I get there just in time for lunch to be served. I help myself to some stir fried tofu and veggies and talk with some coworkers I haven’t talked to in a while. Right as I’m finishing up, the IT director places a gigantic laptop next to me and says “here you go!” He saw my confused expression and said “oh, we don’t have any more 13 inch computers in stock at this office. This computer is technically an engineer spec laptop but the guy we bought this for ended up only working here for 2 months. We have a company policy we can’t reissue engineer spec laptops to other engineers so if you want it it’s yours”. All I could say was “this feels like overkill for someone in legal who’s just running redlines, isn’t it? But I appreciate it!” I bring the computer back to my desk and immediately realize an issue 1) the damn thing is heavy but more pressingly 2) my work bag is only suited to hold a 13 inch laptop and even that was a stretch. I might have let the intrusive thoughts go too far, because I took my computer in my arms and made the short walk to Polène. I had been coveting one of their bags for the past year but could never justify it. And even now I was hoping that the laptop I was carrying wouldn’t fit into it. But sure enough, the Cyme was just as stunning in person and the computer fit in the bag with room to spare. I really must have been in a fugue state because with 15 minutes of walking in, I had already handed my credit card over to the sales associate and said yes to monogramming the bag. **$520.00**

4:00 PM - I had hoped I to be spending the rest of my day doing my normal tasks and setting up my new computer but instead I’m dealing with the landlord because upstairs construction has caused the ADA bathroom to spring a leak. The office manager and I are yelling at management and then I’m running to my desk to call GC who is on the west coast to confirm this is how he wants to handle the issue. Before going back to the landlord and demanding that he fixes the issue and gives us a discount on the rent for each day we’re dealing with this issue. We come to a tentative agreement and I shove all of my things into my new bag before leaving to meet my boyfriend in Brooklyn. 

6:00 PM - Meet for drinks at our favorite tiki bar **$2.90**. M also wanted the cocktail book. The waitress brought it and said she had it signed by the author because he was in the back hanging out **$87.39** ($40 for the cocktail book not included)

8:00 PM - We took the train to a Persian restaurant that M picked out that’s been on our “to try” list for a while **$2.90**. We are seated and only glance at the menu to confirm that everything we debated ordering is still available. We get the grilled carrots, tahini and date salad, the lamb shank with herby rice and extra yogurt. We both had enough to drink so we just get mocktails the waitress recommended.  After inhaling everything and confirming we still have room for dessert, we order the cardamom rose cake. Once we finish that I pay the check (**$165.87**) and we catch back home **$2.90**.

10:00 PM - Back home I let M unwrap his real gift the Rivendell Lego set. We stay up entirely too late for a school night starting the build and sipping chamomile tea. But I couldn’t stand the thought of the day ending. 

**TOTAL: $790.66**

**Day 4 Thursday**

6:00 AM - I wake up to the sounds of dripping. At first I don’t think much of it at first because our bedroom is connected to the terrace so we can always hear rain when it comes but this sounded closer than normal. I sit up and see that water is coming in through the bottom of the door.  I jump out of bed and start shoving towels along the door and go downstairs to grab a bin that’s low enough to catch the water only to see more leaking. I pull old beach towels from the laundry room and large bowls from the kitchen as M comes downstairs and also notices the destruction. The next hour is spent frantically drying up what we can, placing containers under the fast leaking, and taking pictures of everything for the management company. 

9:00 AM - I send the rest of the legal department a slack explaining what happened and that I’ll be on and offline through out the day to handle the state of my apartment. I spend the majority of the day documenting everything in Notion, saving pictures and videos, texting my super, emailing the management, etc. while also trying to answer anything that looked urgent work wise.

12:30 PM - The place is still a disaster but somewhat under control. Management has been silent but the super has come over to check on everything and go up to the terrace and roof to look at the drainage. M runs out to pick up lunch. I requested Vietnamese because all I want after rain inside my apartment is hot crispy spring rolls wrapped in lettuce with nuoc cham and the biggest, hottest bowl of pho possible. He returned with all of that plus a Vietnamese iced coffee and banh xeo. My hero.

7:00 PM - Still nothing from my management company so while M prepares dinner I start drafting a letter to serve my landlord and management company. Because this wasn’t the first time this apartment leaked, I also call up an old friend/coworker, A who is an attorney that works in real estate law, to get his opinion on some things about my lease. We talk over the phone while A reviews my draft and very kindly offers to work on the letter tonight and sign and send it himself after we both approve of it. I offer to call his assistant in the morning to get an engagement letter together and put down a deposit for a retainer but he said the retainer isn’t necessary due to all of the help I did on his pro bono cases years ago even when they hurt my billable hours. But we do agree to execute an engagement letter in the morning. 

9:00 PM - I sit down and eat dinner (boxed mac and cheese) with M and discuss the phone call. We’re going to push to get a rent abatement back dated to when we first started telling the owner and management of the issues. And/or potentially being released from the lease. I give him a rough idea of the game plan, let him read the letter and give any feedback, and we also talk about how we’ll deep clean the apartment/make it livable while its actively still leaking and falling apart. I sit in bed reading *Intermezzo* to unwind\*.\*

**TOTAL: $0.00**

**Day 5 Friday**

9:30 AM - Called my friend’s assistant, she got the EL together while we’re on the phone and promises to send it out once he reviews. He calls an hour later, I Docusign it and we get to finalizing our letter and he serves it. I’m really struck by how lucky I am to have such talented and kind friends because we got a response and a promise for a conference call within the hour. 

12:00 PM - Off the phone with our management company! They tried to low ball us but my attorney and I pushed and got them to agree to paying for professional cleaners, mold testing, on top of a 1/2 month abatement. AND until the apartment is fully repaired we get an effective 5% of the rent for each week we’re waiting. Management gets off the call and I tell A that drinks and dinner are on me on a weekend of his choosing. I also send an emailed thank you and Starbucks (**$25**) gift card to his assistant for putting together my engagement letter first thing in the morning. With that handled, I start working. 

2:00 PM - While I’m doing everything in my power to finish catching up on work I missed in the last 24 hours a fire drill comes in. The CEO wants us to review a new agreement and complete due diligence on a high risk vendor within the day. No one is particularly happy about it, but we all sit on zoom to work on the review together in an attempt to expedite it. 

7:00 PM - Because most of our bowls and large pots are in use to catch rain water we order in again for dinner. Lamb saag for me and butter chicken for him plus naan and samosas. I run out and pick it up myself to save on delivery fees **$39.13**. We eat and watch *Chopped* and I do my Korean homework. 

8:30 PM - Some of M's friends that lives in the neighborhood asked if we want to meet up for belated birthday drinks. We say we’d love to come and blow off some steam so we meet at a dive bar we all like that’s equidistant. We love all of the staff, vibe, and beer list.  We didn’t let M pay for anything and his friends were kind enough to pay the whole bill but I insisted on leaving the tip (**$40.00**).

**TOTAL: $104.13**

**Day 6 Saturday**

8:30 AM - Awake and somehow not feeling pickled despite all the drinking. I go downstairs and make some homemade biscuits and gravy. M comes down saying he was woken up from the smell.   He’s having a harder time this morning. He says its because he didn’t sleep well. I say it’s because he was taking shots with everyone and old now. After eating, I start cleaning the apartment and take extra care to look for any missed water damage or mold. M has to have some gatorade and ibuprofen before joining my crusade.  

11:00 AM - All dust bunnies have been vanquished. M plays 2K while I paint my nails. I still am unable to justify the price of a manicure but I want to try a glass nail trend I saw on TikTok. I’m hoping that I can get it done and look decent within 2 hours so I still have time to enjoy my day. 

3:00 PM - My nails turned out almost exactly like the pictures I saw. I feel invincible. I FaceTime my girlfriend, S, who lives near by to see if she wants to hang out. She says she wants to but would need to stay home because her fridge is having issues. I say we’re happy to come! I hang up and make a jug of our fave lychee martinis and walk over with M. Her wife is out of town so she’s taking advantage by just watching all the sports she can. We start with some college football before switching to the WNBA playoff games. M abstains from the martinis but I get toasty. S had dinner already on the stove and she offers us oxtails, rice and peas, and plantains. Truly a perfect day. 

10:30 PM - I start nodding off due to the booze and oxtail so M excuses us and walks us home. I fall asleep before my head hits the pillow. 

**TOTAL: $0.00**

**Day 7 Sunday**

7:00 AM - Up and just applying some sunscreen before heading to Pilates (**$2.90**). M meets me after class with a protein shake that I drink while we take a long walk home.  After my shower I sit down with YNAB and review everything that’s happened during the week. The botox and birthday expenses were somewhat expected and are mostly being covered with sinking funds but the bag was super impulsive. I do some reviewing and rebalancing and find that I’m able to reconcile about half of the bag. And even though it’s not the true YNAB way I make a note that I’ll need to use my next paycheck to cover the rest.  

12:00 PM - Pull a large ribeye from the freezer and place it in the sink with running water to thaw for dinner. For lunch I just slap together some soondubu and rice. M and I spend the day reading, listening to records, and playing some board games. 

7:30 PM - I make some gochujang garlic compound butter and place it in the fridge before I get the smash potatoes into the oven. I head upstairs with and grill the seasoned steak and some asparagus. M and I dig in while we discuss the apartment, the week ahead, and our general plans for the rest of the year.

This was an absolutely **unhinged** week of spending for me. And while there is definitely a natural ebb and flow with how money gets spent this was still an abnormal week. I’ll def be at home and for the foreseeable future and only spending in categories that were budgeted for. Luckily I have a lot of knitting projects to keep me occupied at home.

I wrote this a few weeks ago and I can confirm that since then my apartment has been fixed (we tested, found, and removed all the mold; patched holes’ replaced floors; etc) and I’ve gotten 1 month of rent free. M and I are putting that month of free rent into a HYSA so we have a moving fund started for next summer. 

Finally, after a week of dealing with 2 landlords I'm further inspired to get my own apartment. I swear nothing has radicalized me further than just dealing with greedy, lazy landlords and management companies. I only started my house fund a few months ago but I'm going to put most of my Christmas bonus away and move some things around in my budget to save more aggressively.",13,1730244852.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,9,0.93,False

1gf8o6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gf8o6a/my_son_and_i_built_a_free_library_in_our_front/,my son and i built a free library in our front yard. someone left a book in it.,"My neighborhood isn't your cliche movie neighborhood. The lawns aren't perfect, kids don't leave bikes lying around on the sidewalks, and neighbors don't smile and wave as you drive by.  We all kind of mind our own business, for the most part. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with any one of my neighbors. But to my defense, my neighborhood isn't built like a traditional neighborhood.

I live in Castro Valley. Emphasis on the ""valley."" The entire town is built on hills. The block I live on resembles more of a roller coaster than a street. I wish I could say you get used to living like this, but you don't. My house is smack in the middle of a hill; and after a decade of living here, I've discovered that I'm a ""house half uphill"" kind of guy.

My ten-year-old son, Cooper, loves it here. There's a single-screen movie theater down the street, next door to that is a comic book shop, across the street is an ice cream parlor, and a few blocks over is Golfland. I'm convinced that Castro Valley was designed by a child.

Cooper had overheard my wife and I talking about how unfriendly our neighborhood felt and he had an idea of how we could do our part in fixing it. When he visits my mother-in-law, they like to go on walks. I guess a neighbor of hers has one of those Little Free Library things in their front yard. The mailbox looking thing that the owner fills with books, and anyone walking by is encouraged to trade one of their own books for one in the library. Cooper said we could fill it with all of our favorite books, so our neighbors could get to know us a little better.

He had spring break coming up, and I had vacation days lying around, so I planned on taking the week off to spend with him. I figured building the library was a great opportunity for a father-son project.

The sun was setting, and admittedly, it may have taken a little longer than anticipated to build, but there it was nonetheless. We took a step back and admired the little library that was now standing firmly in our yard. I handed him a paintbrush and told him that all the library was missing was a name. He gave it some thought, then started with the brush. When he moved away, I could see that he painted ""Greenridge Road Library"" in big green letters. Fittingly named after the street we live on.

The next day, I peeled myself off of my mattress and dragged my feet into the kitchen. Cooper was sitting on the couch, fully dressed, shoes tied, hair brushed, ready to go. I have weird attachments to all of Cooper's stuff. He's our only child, so every little thing of his is tethered to precious memories. I couldn't just let him put his books, which my wife and I read to him over the years, outside for strangers to take. So, I told him we would go to the bookstore to get new books to use.

Before we left, Cooper ran over to check our Greenridge Road Library. I hurried to catch up to him when I saw him jumping up and down with excitement. He screamed ""Dad! Dad! Look!"" And to my surprise, there was already a book sitting inside of the little library, patiently waiting for us to adopt it.

It was a Penguin Random House children's book titled: ""How to Swim and Dive."" It was a cute, little, vintage, book about learning how to swim. And even though it was covered in a clear, but yellowing, protective jacket; the book was extremely weathered. It looked decades old. The style of the cover art and pictures throughout the pages made me think it may be midcentury era. The once bright colored spine was cracking and had a slight tear through the ""V"" in the book name, giving it the new title: ""How to Swim and Die."" That got a guilty chuckle out of me.

The book jacket proudly wore a sticker for the Hayward Public Library. Hayward is Castro Valley's sister city, so it wasn't too surprising that a book from there ended up minutes away in our front yard. What was surprising was the fully intact checkout card still in the sleeve on the inside. The only name and date on the card were: Roger Davis on April 3rd, 1964.

Out of curiosity, I Googled the name Roger Davis. Facebook and LinkedIn profiles popped up, all of smiling young men that were half of the age my Roger Davis would be today. I tried to narrow the search down by adding ""California,"" but no luck. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, So I went to scavenge for The Yellow Pages book that I thought we still had somewhere.

If I had given it any real thought, I would have remembered that we got rid of our last one about five spring cleanings ago. I figured this would be the perfect time to introduce my son to the public library system. I told Cooper that we could go to the Hayward Library; since that was where the book was originally from. And we could maybe even see if they could look up any information on Roger Davis.

Although he was incredibly eager to get inside and work the case, Cooper still held the library door open for the fragile moving old man walking behind us. The librarian glared at me over the top of her thick lenses, with an ""Are you serious?"" look on her face. She sighed and lectured me on why she couldn't share the private information of their members, even if they had it. Which they didn’t. Those records were long gone. Also long gone: the Yellow Pages, apparently. I don’t know why I assumed the library would have them, but they didn’t. So, I ordered one on my phone to be delivered to my house and we left. On the way out, Cooper whispered to me that he'd be a nicer librarian for The Greenridge Road Library.

The following day was a hotter than usual spring day. My wife and I decided that a family day at the community pool sounded good. We didn't have a pool in our backyard, and no one else we knew did, either. And as a result, Cooper wasn't the best swimmer. But lucky for him, we just so happened to have come into the custody of a how-to swim book.

We got to the pool and I had the highly important job of securing pool chairs for my family. It took me a little while to collect enough chairs. It would have taken longer, if not for the elderly gentleman who graciously volunteered his chair to me. His attempt at hiding from the sun under a bucket hat and sunglasses was failing, so he was leaving anyway. He was amused that I was carrying around such a vintage book. On his way out, he gave the faintest smile and said that he had the same book when he was younger.

I started thumbing through the pages to see if there were any good pointers that I could relay to Cooper, and I must not have looked hard enough the first time we found the book because I now noticed handwritten numbers on the bottom corner of every page. Two numbers on each page and they didn't correspond to the page number at all. The first page had ""37."" The next one had ""66,"" the third page had ""46,"" and so on; fifteen numbers in total. There was no obvious reason or pattern to the order, but they were neatly written and obviously intentional.

I'm not too proud to admit that my wife is smarter than I am, but I still felt like a complete idiot when it only took her a millisecond to glance at the pages and say ""Oh, neat! It's coordinates.""  Of course. Why wasn't that my first guess? Cooper asked what coordinates were and when I explained them to him, he got really excited at the thought of it being buried treasure. That excitement soured to disappointment when I shot down his proposal to go chase the coordinates that exact minute. I told him we could go the following day, and then hit the biggest cannonball he's ever seen as a distraction.

Cooper shook me until I fully woke up. He wouldn't stop until I had Google Maps open. He watched with anticipation as I typed in each number of the coordinates. The pin dropped into a cluster of trees, a little ways off of the Ward Creek walking trail in the Hayward hills. To his delight, it was only a ten-minute drive away.

Cooper was so excited walking that trail. He's not an introvert, but he rarely talks to strangers. That day, he was waving and saying hi to everyone we crossed paths with. The family walking their dog got a hey from Cooper. He said ""Have a nice day"" to the pale-haired, old man, that was catching his breath on a bench. One jogger even got a high-five from Cooper.

I couldn't help but feel like an irresponsible parent when we reached the point of the walkway that we had to diverge off of to get to the coordinates. It didn't seem like the safest trek for a ten-year-old to make, but I couldn't stomach telling him that he couldn't see this through. As we approached the coordinates, I could make out glimpses of unnatural colors in the distance. At first, I thought it was a group of people, and slid Cooper behind me as we walked up.

Standing directly on top of the coordinates, we were dead center to a group of trees. On each tree, was a t-shirt nailed to it; creating a surrounding audience. The shirts were small, like they'd fit Cooper. Six in total. Vintage, ringer style shirts with red trim and matching red font that read ""Hayward Plunge."" On the inside tags, I could make out handwritten names: John, Henry, Susie, Wayne, Donna, and Jackie.

I had no idea what Hayward Plunge meant or who these names belonged to, but that didn't really matter, I was full on panicking. My fight or flight was in high gear. This wasn't the innocent treasure hunt we thought it would be. This was wrong, very wrong. I was wrong to bring my son here. I played enough high school football to know what dried blood stains looked like on fabric.

I didn't want to let Cooper see the concern on my face, and I knew he was on the verge of asking if we could start digging for the treasure that he thought was beneath us. I needed to get him out of there as soon as possible. I tried to drum up fake enthusiasm and say we needed to celebrate us making it to the finish line. I told him we deserved ice cream for our hard work. He wasn't ready to leave until I told him he could get as many scoops and toppings as he wanted. Luckily, that was enough to get him out of there.

I thought a night of sleep would help distance me from the kid's shirts on the trees, but it didn't. It was on my mind as I got out of bed, and as I made my coffee, and was very prominently on my mind as I stood at the front room window watching my own child play in the front yard. I watched him look under rocks for bugs, and lay in the grass, and eventually check The Greenridge Road Library. Then, I watched him run into the house holding a stack of books.

He proudly laid them out on display. My stomach turned as I realized they were more vintage books. Artwork and color palettes from an era long gone. Titles like ""The Clumsy Cowboy"" and ""Hurry Up, Slowpoke."" I peeked over his shoulder as he grabbed one and skimmed through the pages. On the inside cover, read the generic ""this book belongs to:"" with Wayne scribbled under it.

For the last twenty-four hours, six names have been playing on a loop in my head. Wayne was one of them. I grabbed a different book and opened it: Susie. I didn't need to grab anymore, I already knew what I'd find. But I did anyway. One inside cover after the other; John, then Jackie, then Henry, and finally Donna.

I was ready to tear the Greenridge Road Library out of the ground at this point. I scoured through my Ring notifications. Ever since we installed the library, it seemed like all of Castro Valley stops by and looks through it. I had hundreds of clips of people in front of it. It could have been any one of them. I dissected each clip to see if I could find who left the books. The problem was that the library was positioned in a way that the camera couldn't see if someone was taking or placing books. To be honest, this made me incredibly skeptical of my neighbors. Was it the dad walking his kids? The moms pushing strollers? The dog walker group? The mailman?

I gave up the hunt and set my phone on my lap as the clips continued playing. At this point, I was fully losing it. I don't know why this upset me as much as it did. It's not like someone is putting inappropriate material in the library. No one was committing crimes. It was just weird and creepy. I thought maybe it was an elaborate prank. I was willing to accept it as a prank and move on.

When I picked up my phone, it was halfway through a clip. There was no one in front of the Greenridge Road Library, or my house. So, I was confused as to why this was recorded. Then in the corner of the frame, I noticed an old man, standing across the street, and looking at the library. He remained still for an uncomfortable amount of time before turning and leaving. The video was super grainy and he was so far away that I couldn't make out any details of his face. It felt strange, though. This was enough to make me want to solve all of this, simply so I could feel like my family was safe in our home.

I tried to take inventory of all the information I had. The books, the names, the year on the library card, the coordinates, and the blood stained shirts on the trees. Shirts that had text on them. ""Hayward Plunge."" I typed the phrase into a search bar. The first suggestion was a link to the Hayward Parks and Rec website. To the right of that was a small collage consisting of a map, street view, and picture of the inside of a building.

Built in 1936, the Hayward Plunge is an indoor swimming facility. It's essentially one big pool inside of a hangar-like structure. Additionally, after seeing the map of where the plunge was located, I realized the trail that I was just on the other day, ran directly behind the building. Finally, things were starting to click.

I was waiting at the front desk as the teenager working it went off to get the manager. I felt a little foolish, but at this point, there was no way I could leave this thread loose. The manager came walking up and asked how they could help me. I took a deep breath and made the jump. I explained how I came into possession of Roger Davis's swim instruction book, how it led me to the trail, and to the displayed Hayward Plunge shirts. Which all brought me there to speak with her.I don't know what I was expecting. It was a lot of random information to unload on an unsuspecting stranger. I for sure wasn't expecting the manager's face to drop like it did. She paused for a second, then asked ""Could we talk in my office?""

I took a seat at the desk across from her. She didn't hesitate. She said, ""Back in the day there was a small beginner swimming class that had some students who went missing."" That was chilling enough, but she continued. ""This was in the 60's, so they didn't have camera surveillance or anything like that. The Hayward P.D. didn't have any evidence of who took the kids or where the kids went."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say anything, because she wasn't done. This time needing a little more strength, eventually pushing out, ""It's like, an urban legend around here, so take it with a grain of salt; but people say their swim instructor had something to do with the missing kids."" I could see it in her eyes before her words came out. I knew what was coming next. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""The instructor, his name.... was Roger.""

Everything was still spinning when I strapped my seatbelt in and it didn’t stop during the drive home. What did I invite to my home? What danger did I put my son in? Who or where was Roger Davis? That last question would be answered a lot quicker than I anticipated.

Waiting for me at our front door, was the gigantic waste of paper that is, the Yellow Pages. It made a huge thud on my kitchen table when I set it down to grab a beer. I could feel it staring at me the whole time. Begging me to open it. I knew I had to, but I really didn't want to. I was already fed up with this whole situation. It had escalated to points that I was not prepared for. I looked back at the yellow pages. It was just sitting there. I took a swig of beer and said fuck it.

I found the residents section and made my way to the names under D. It didn’t take long to put my finger over the first Davis. It was a page over and near the bottom, but there he was. Roger M. Davis. I should have left it there. Cool, I found him. Mission accomplished. I should have taken the win and moved on with my life. But I just couldn't help myself. I needed to know.

I panned to the right of his name, where his address was. I felt my beer rising in my throat as I did. Next to his name and under ""current address"" was, Green Ridge Road.

The scariest house isn't always the one that looks like it. It's not always the dilapidated house with the dead lawn and shady looking tenets who won't make eye contact with you. Sometimes it's the house that's painted in the friendliest shade of soft yellow. The one that has an American flag perfectly flying from the porch. The one with the old man that comes out like clockwork to hand water his lawn. The house that you have no problem sending your kid to their front door for candy on Halloween. What is it they say about book covers?

Roger Davis was arrested for the murders of John and Jackie Miller, ages 9 and 8. Donna Zimmerman, age 7. Wayne Jackson, age 8. Susie Lee, age 8. Henry Parker, age 6. Almost sixty years after he committed the crimes. He was 86 at the time of his arrest.

I gave the police everything I had. They used fingerprints from Henry Parker's copy of ""The Rise and Fall of Ben Gizzard,"" that was left in our library, to match with some found on belongings of his that his diligent mother kept well preserved after all these years. Roger's prints were also a match on all of the kid's books, as well as the ""How to Swim and Dive"" manual we found in our little library.

Cadaver dogs hit on the area of the coordinates and they were able to recover the remains of all the children. My stomach still fills with shame and dread because I willingly brought my son to the burial site. I let him stand feet above the bones of murdered children as we played around on a pretend scavenger hunt.

We were in the middle of dinner weeks later when I heard the sirens. Flashing lights followed, reflecting off our walls. Our street doesn't get police activity very often, if at all. I knew who they were coming for.

It took me a couple of minutes to walk down my street and get to the house surrounded by the crime scene tape. As I approached, two officers walked out a slightly hunched, white-haired man, in handcuffs. He looked frail and confused, and unremarkable from any other elderly person in the community. He wasn't someone who looked like they would be getting arrested. The policemen closed the squad door behind him, regardless.

I observed him as he sat in the backseat of the cop car. He wasn't moving at all and he was seemingly focused on the nothingness in front of him. He stayed like this for an uncomfortable amount of time.

An officer told me he couldn't share any information on the case, not knowing that I was the one who revived the six cold cases with my findings. There wasn't much more for me to see, and it felt like it was time for me to head back home.

I looked one more time at Roger. I just wanted to burn into my eyes what evil could look like, so I never put my son in danger ever again. After a few seconds, the vile old man slowly started to turn his whole body towards the window. Towards me.

His face was blank and devoid of any humanity. He pointed his vacant and dark eyes at me. I could see the faintest bit of recognition from him once he saw me. I didn't want to look away. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear on someone one last time. Even if I was terrified inside.

My last glimpse of him, before the car hauled him away, was the slow movement of his mouth forming the slightest, perverted, grin. He was enjoying this. He knew that he'd die soon, and he'd essentially got away with his crimes. I don't think that's what made him smile in that moment, though.

He knew that I'd see him again. Every time I watched someone leave a book in the Green Ridge Road Library for Cooper, or when Cooper's baseball coach pulls him aside to give him tips on his swing, or when I had parent-teacher conferences and met Cooper's teachers. He knew that I'd see him in every one of those people that I was trusting to be around my son.

He knew that's how he would live on.",5,1730244358.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False
1gf8ns0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gf8ns0/my_28m_dad_60m_is_choosing_his_new_family_over_me/,My (28M) dad (60M) is choosing his new family over me. What can I do?,"Okay so buckle up, this is a long one folks; if you have the patience to sit through it though, I would absolutely love the feedback. 

First of all, I’m a trans male, so the first half of my story (everything before 18) is when I was still identifying as a female. 

I don’t remember much about my parents relationship, but I do remember they fought a lot. They divorced when I 6, and they split custody 50/50 until we were old enough to decide for ourselves. When my sister was 12, she decided to live with my mom full time because she felt like my dad treated me and my brother differently than her because she was from a previous marriage. He decided to “help her move out” by putting all her stuff out on the lawn for her to pickup. He also told her that she would have to continue to take care of her bunny when she left, but because my mom didn’t have the space the bunny stayed with my dad. He told her it was her responsibility to feed it, but when she couldn’t come every single day (my mom had to drive her), he let the poor thing starve to death. Both of these things should’ve made me think twice but I was a kid and I don’t think I knew how to process this yet. 

My brother and I continued to go back and forth with each other until I turned 12, and then I moved in with my dad. At the time, living with my mom was chaotic at best; I think over worked single parent with a wine dependency sums it up pretty well. I can remember her coming home after a work party and trying to pee in the living room, venting to us about her money and man troubles, and I had moved 13 times between 6-12. I chose stability. 

My dad married my step mom and within a year she had my little sister, and from that point on her life was the most important. I wasn’t allowed to play competitive basketball (despite the principal interrupting a class I was in to ask me to play) because my dad and step mom would be too tired from my little sister to take me to my practices. My parents stopped showing up to most concerts (I played trumpet), sports games (even when I qualified for the provincial team), and I kinda only started hearing what I was doing wrong at any point. This really messed with my head because I was good kid, stayed away from drugs, didn’t party, made good grades, etc. But honestly shit didn’t really hit the fan until I was 15/16. 

 I met my girlfriend at the time, and for the first time ever someone was asking me how I was for real, and I kinda broke. I realized I was depressed, had been dealing with anxiety since I was kid, and so I got medicated. Unfortunately that just made me gain A LOT of weight, which did not help my already hemorrhaging social life. I also attended counselling but I don’t think I was ready to be honest enough for that to work. 

On top of all this, my dad and step mom made it pretty clear that being gay was not ok, despite reassuring me when I came out that it was chill. I wasn’t allowed to go to team sleepovers, I had to sit with my girlfriend in the living room if we wanted to hang, and then the cherry on the cake: my step mom asked a councillor that was at my house for mental health reasons if “it was appropriate for {me} to be teaching young girls field hockey given {my}  sexuality”. The councillor turned out to be a gay man, so he politely told her to fuck off, but that comment has haunted me my whole life. Did they actually believe I was a pedophile? 

By 17, I had attempted my life unsuccessfully and was committed for 10 days. My family visited me in the hospital, but I learned later my dad did not like the “scene it caused”. 

By 18/19 I had come to terms with being trans, and so I told my dad. At the time I was about to head into my year of university after a year of community college (didn’t know what I wanted to do.). My dad told me he didn’t know how my step mom would react, and couldn’t I just wait until after I got my degree? He also tried pressuring me by saying that my little sister would be affected, what would she think and what if she got bullied etc. I didn’t know what to do so I left in the middle of the night with my stuff in garbage bags and headed to my mom’s. 

I had only started talking to my mom again recently, from 16-18 we didn’t speak at all, but I really needed support. I had cut her off because I felt like as soon as I got a job when I was 13/14 that she would just emotionally manipulate me into buying her stuff. I didn’t have a lot of options. 

My step mom reached out to me during this period to say I could come back and live with them but I couldn’t trust that so I stayed with my mom.

My mom and me ended up having to sue my dad to pay the child support he owed my mom for housing me while I was in school and that probably put a big dent in our relationship. Even with that though, I still had to come up with thousands of dollars fast. 

So I took out student loans and decided to do it on my own, and for a while I did well. I was the equity and outreach coordinator for my department, I had been hired by a professor to do research for a project he was working on, I got accepted into a film program and had my work come 3rd in a competition, and I was gaining experience in my field.

I moved in with my partner and it was great. I invited my mom to come visit but she showed up plastered and spilt wine on our carpet. After talking things through with my partner I decided I had to take a break from talking to my mom again. I love her, but she had so many toxic behaviours, a lot I haven’t even bothered to include, and I was trying to grow and be better. 

 It kinda all crashed when i  couldn’t afford to do everything I was doing without working more, but I couldn’t work more based on my load, so I dropped out. 

Eventually I got a job at a charity, and I’m doing pretty well for myself now. I’m happily living my life as a male, I pass well, and I have an amazing partner and a cute dog. The only thing is my partner is severely traumatized from his childhood ( way WAY worse than mine) and as a result developed  cptsd, anxiety, depression, odd and alcoholism. I’ve been supporting him fully for the last 4 months, and before that his grandma was helping out financially. I am working on helping him get on disability, but for now I’m working 2-3 jobs and struggling to support us. It doesn’t help that I have ADD and my biggest issue is keeping a clean house, so he’s often stuck at home in a mess which just exasperates the situation.  

I reached out to my dad last week to see if there was any way he could help us out but just like he’s said any other time I’ve brought this up, I just have to see what’s going in and out and make them balance. Keep in mind, my dad lives in a very nice (over a million dollars) house, has two cars, goes on vacations, puts my little sister through private school, and has told me that he plans to let ally stay in the house after they downsize and they could just rent the other rooms out. Oh and he’d put her through school. 

This weekend I went to my dad’s place for a coffee and to say happy birthday to my step mom, and I ended up spilling a lot of beans to her. Little did I know, she had no idea about so many things that he did. I told her about the struggles I’d been going through, and I was getting a genuine human response, like real empathy, so I kept talking. I talked about my money troubles, why I was having them, and she seemed to genuinely get it and promised to talk to my dad about it.  There was a bunch of other stuff we talked about but that was the bit that I thought might really change things. 

Anyways, it’s Tuesday now and I asked my dad if we could get a coffee today and his only response was sorry, not today. I don’t know if I should try to talk to them both at the same time, or how to even proceed. 

This has been a whirlwind of a post, but I hope it makes sense, and like I said at the beginning any and all thoughts are welcome. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1gf8nqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1gf8nqm/my_son_and_i_built_a_free_library_in_our_front/,my son and i built a free library in our front yard. someone left a book in it.,"My neighborhood isn't your cliche movie neighborhood. The lawns aren't perfect, kids don't leave bikes lying around on the sidewalks, and neighbors don't smile and wave as you drive by.  We all kind of mind our own business, for the most part. To be honest, I don't think I've ever had a conversation with any one of my neighbors. But to my defense, my neighborhood isn't built like a traditional neighborhood.

I live in Castro Valley. Emphasis on the ""valley."" The entire town is built on hills. The block I live on resembles more of a roller coaster than a street. I wish I could say you get used to living like this, but you don't. My house is smack in the middle of a hill; and after a decade of living here, I've discovered that I'm a ""house half uphill"" kind of guy.

My ten-year-old son, Cooper, loves it here. There's a single-screen movie theater down the street, next door to that is a comic book shop, across the street is an ice cream parlor, and a few blocks over is Golfland. I'm convinced that Castro Valley was designed by a child.

Cooper had overheard my wife and I talking about how unfriendly our neighborhood felt and he had an idea of how we could do our part in fixing it. When he visits my mother-in-law, they like to go on walks. I guess a neighbor of hers has one of those Little Free Library things in their front yard. The mailbox looking thing that the owner fills with books, and anyone walking by is encouraged to trade one of their own books for one in the library. Cooper said we could fill it with all of our favorite books, so our neighbors could get to know us a little better.

He had spring break coming up, and I had vacation days lying around, so I planned on taking the week off to spend with him. I figured building the library was a great opportunity for a father-son project.

The sun was setting, and admittedly, it may have taken a little longer than anticipated to build, but there it was nonetheless. We took a step back and admired the little library that was now standing firmly in our yard. I handed him a paintbrush and told him that all the library was missing was a name. He gave it some thought, then started with the brush. When he moved away, I could see that he painted ""Greenridge Road Library"" in big green letters. Fittingly named after the street we live on.

The next day, I peeled myself off of my mattress and dragged my feet into the kitchen. Cooper was sitting on the couch, fully dressed, shoes tied, hair brushed, ready to go. I have weird attachments to all of Cooper's stuff. He's our only child, so every little thing of his is tethered to precious memories. I couldn't just let him put his books, which my wife and I read to him over the years, outside for strangers to take. So, I told him we would go to the bookstore to get new books to use.

Before we left, Cooper ran over to check our Greenridge Road Library. I hurried to catch up to him when I saw him jumping up and down with excitement. He screamed ""Dad! Dad! Look!"" And to my surprise, there was already a book sitting inside of the little library, patiently waiting for us to adopt it.

It was a Penguin Random House children's book titled: ""How to Swim and Dive."" It was a cute, little, vintage, book about learning how to swim. And even though it was covered in a clear, but yellowing, protective jacket; the book was extremely weathered. It looked decades old. The style of the cover art and pictures throughout the pages made me think it may be midcentury era. The once bright colored spine was cracking and had a slight tear through the ""V"" in the book name, giving it the new title: ""How to Swim and Die."" That got a guilty chuckle out of me.

The book jacket proudly wore a sticker for the Hayward Public Library. Hayward is Castro Valley's sister city, so it wasn't too surprising that a book from there ended up minutes away in our front yard. What was surprising was the fully intact checkout card still in the sleeve on the inside. The only name and date on the card were: Roger Davis on April 3rd, 1964.

Out of curiosity, I Googled the name Roger Davis. Facebook and LinkedIn profiles popped up, all of smiling young men that were half of the age my Roger Davis would be today. I tried to narrow the search down by adding ""California,"" but no luck. I'm old enough to remember life before the internet, So I went to scavenge for The Yellow Pages book that I thought we still had somewhere.

If I had given it any real thought, I would have remembered that we got rid of our last one about five spring cleanings ago. I figured this would be the perfect time to introduce my son to the public library system. I told Cooper that we could go to the Hayward Library; since that was where the book was originally from. And we could maybe even see if they could look up any information on Roger Davis.

Although he was incredibly eager to get inside and work the case, Cooper still held the library door open for the fragile moving old man walking behind us. The librarian glared at me over the top of her thick lenses, with an ""Are you serious?"" look on her face. She sighed and lectured me on why she couldn't share the private information of their members, even if they had it. Which they didn’t. Those records were long gone. Also long gone: the Yellow Pages, apparently. I don’t know why I assumed the library would have them, but they didn’t. So, I ordered one on my phone to be delivered to my house and we left. On the way out, Cooper whispered to me that he'd be a nicer librarian for The Greenridge Road Library.

The following day was a hotter than usual spring day. My wife and I decided that a family day at the community pool sounded good. We didn't have a pool in our backyard, and no one else we knew did, either. And as a result, Cooper wasn't the best swimmer. But lucky for him, we just so happened to have come into the custody of a how-to swim book.

We got to the pool and I had the highly important job of securing pool chairs for my family. It took me a little while to collect enough chairs. It would have taken longer, if not for the elderly gentleman who graciously volunteered his chair to me. His attempt at hiding from the sun under a bucket hat and sunglasses was failing, so he was leaving anyway. He was amused that I was carrying around such a vintage book. On his way out, he gave the faintest smile and said that he had the same book when he was younger.

I started thumbing through the pages to see if there were any good pointers that I could relay to Cooper, and I must not have looked hard enough the first time we found the book because I now noticed handwritten numbers on the bottom corner of every page. Two numbers on each page and they didn't correspond to the page number at all. The first page had ""37."" The next one had ""66,"" the third page had ""46,"" and so on; fifteen numbers in total. There was no obvious reason or pattern to the order, but they were neatly written and obviously intentional.

I'm not too proud to admit that my wife is smarter than I am, but I still felt like a complete idiot when it only took her a millisecond to glance at the pages and say ""Oh, neat! It's coordinates.""  Of course. Why wasn't that my first guess? Cooper asked what coordinates were and when I explained them to him, he got really excited at the thought of it being buried treasure. That excitement soured to disappointment when I shot down his proposal to go chase the coordinates that exact minute. I told him we could go the following day, and then hit the biggest cannonball he's ever seen as a distraction.

Cooper shook me until I fully woke up. He wouldn't stop until I had Google Maps open. He watched with anticipation as I typed in each number of the coordinates. The pin dropped into a cluster of trees, a little ways off of the Ward Creek walking trail in the Hayward hills. To his delight, it was only a ten-minute drive away.

Cooper was so excited walking that trail. He's not an introvert, but he rarely talks to strangers. That day, he was waving and saying hi to everyone we crossed paths with. The family walking their dog got a hey from Cooper. He said ""Have a nice day"" to the pale-haired, old man, that was catching his breath on a bench. One jogger even got a high-five from Cooper.

I couldn't help but feel like an irresponsible parent when we reached the point of the walkway that we had to diverge off of to get to the coordinates. It didn't seem like the safest trek for a ten-year-old to make, but I couldn't stomach telling him that he couldn't see this through. As we approached the coordinates, I could make out glimpses of unnatural colors in the distance. At first, I thought it was a group of people, and slid Cooper behind me as we walked up.

Standing directly on top of the coordinates, we were dead center to a group of trees. On each tree, was a t-shirt nailed to it; creating a surrounding audience. The shirts were small, like they'd fit Cooper. Six in total. Vintage, ringer style shirts with red trim and matching red font that read ""Hayward Plunge."" On the inside tags, I could make out handwritten names: John, Henry, Susie, Wayne, Donna, and Jackie.

I had no idea what Hayward Plunge meant or who these names belonged to, but that didn't really matter, I was full on panicking. My fight or flight was in high gear. This wasn't the innocent treasure hunt we thought it would be. This was wrong, very wrong. I was wrong to bring my son here. I played enough high school football to know what dried blood stains looked like on fabric.

I didn't want to let Cooper see the concern on my face, and I knew he was on the verge of asking if we could start digging for the treasure that he thought was beneath us. I needed to get him out of there as soon as possible. I tried to drum up fake enthusiasm and say we needed to celebrate us making it to the finish line. I told him we deserved ice cream for our hard work. He wasn't ready to leave until I told him he could get as many scoops and toppings as he wanted. Luckily, that was enough to get him out of there.

I thought a night of sleep would help distance me from the kid's shirts on the trees, but it didn't. It was on my mind as I got out of bed, and as I made my coffee, and was very prominently on my mind as I stood at the front room window watching my own child play in the front yard. I watched him look under rocks for bugs, and lay in the grass, and eventually check The Greenridge Road Library. Then, I watched him run into the house holding a stack of books.

He proudly laid them out on display. My stomach turned as I realized they were more vintage books. Artwork and color palettes from an era long gone. Titles like ""The Clumsy Cowboy"" and ""Hurry Up, Slowpoke."" I peeked over his shoulder as he grabbed one and skimmed through the pages. On the inside cover, read the generic ""this book belongs to:"" with Wayne scribbled under it.

For the last twenty-four hours, six names have been playing on a loop in my head. Wayne was one of them. I grabbed a different book and opened it: Susie. I didn't need to grab anymore, I already knew what I'd find. But I did anyway. One inside cover after the other; John, then Jackie, then Henry, and finally Donna.

I was ready to tear the Greenridge Road Library out of the ground at this point. I scoured through my Ring notifications. Ever since we installed the library, it seemed like all of Castro Valley stops by and looks through it. I had hundreds of clips of people in front of it. It could have been any one of them. I dissected each clip to see if I could find who left the books. The problem was that the library was positioned in a way that the camera couldn't see if someone was taking or placing books. To be honest, this made me incredibly skeptical of my neighbors. Was it the dad walking his kids? The moms pushing strollers? The dog walker group? The mailman?

I gave up the hunt and set my phone on my lap as the clips continued playing. At this point, I was fully losing it. I don't know why this upset me as much as it did. It's not like someone is putting inappropriate material in the library. No one was committing crimes. It was just weird and creepy. I thought maybe it was an elaborate prank. I was willing to accept it as a prank and move on.

When I picked up my phone, it was halfway through a clip. There was no one in front of the Greenridge Road Library, or my house. So, I was confused as to why this was recorded. Then in the corner of the frame, I noticed an old man, standing across the street, and looking at the library. He remained still for an uncomfortable amount of time before turning and leaving. The video was super grainy and he was so far away that I couldn't make out any details of his face. It felt strange, though. This was enough to make me want to solve all of this, simply so I could feel like my family was safe in our home.

I tried to take inventory of all the information I had. The books, the names, the year on the library card, the coordinates, and the blood stained shirts on the trees. Shirts that had text on them. ""Hayward Plunge."" I typed the phrase into a search bar. The first suggestion was a link to the Hayward Parks and Rec website. To the right of that was a small collage consisting of a map, street view, and picture of the inside of a building.

Built in 1936, the Hayward Plunge is an indoor swimming facility. It's essentially one big pool inside of a hangar-like structure. Additionally, after seeing the map of where the plunge was located, I realized the trail that I was just on the other day, ran directly behind the building. Finally, things were starting to click.

I was waiting at the front desk as the teenager working it went off to get the manager. I felt a little foolish, but at this point, there was no way I could leave this thread loose. The manager came walking up and asked how they could help me. I took a deep breath and made the jump. I explained how I came into possession of Roger Davis's swim instruction book, how it led me to the trail, and to the displayed Hayward Plunge shirts. Which all brought me there to speak with her.I don't know what I was expecting. It was a lot of random information to unload on an unsuspecting stranger. I for sure wasn't expecting the manager's face to drop like it did. She paused for a second, then asked ""Could we talk in my office?""

I took a seat at the desk across from her. She didn't hesitate. She said, ""Back in the day there was a small beginner swimming class that had some students who went missing."" That was chilling enough, but she continued. ""This was in the 60's, so they didn't have camera surveillance or anything like that. The Hayward P.D. didn't have any evidence of who took the kids or where the kids went."" I didn't know what to say. I didn't need to say anything, because she wasn't done. This time needing a little more strength, eventually pushing out, ""It's like, an urban legend around here, so take it with a grain of salt; but people say their swim instructor had something to do with the missing kids."" I could see it in her eyes before her words came out. I knew what was coming next. She looked me dead in the eye and said, ""The instructor, his name.... was Roger.""

Everything was still spinning when I strapped my seatbelt in and it didn’t stop during the drive home. What did I invite to my home? What danger did I put my son in? Who or where was Roger Davis? That last question would be answered a lot quicker than I anticipated.

Waiting for me at our front door, was the gigantic waste of paper that is, the Yellow Pages. It made a huge thud on my kitchen table when I set it down to grab a beer. I could feel it staring at me the whole time. Begging me to open it. I knew I had to, but I really didn't want to. I was already fed up with this whole situation. It had escalated to points that I was not prepared for. I looked back at the yellow pages. It was just sitting there. I took a swig of beer and said fuck it.

I found the residents section and made my way to the names under D. It didn’t take long to put my finger over the first Davis. It was a page over and near the bottom, but there he was. Roger M. Davis. I should have left it there. Cool, I found him. Mission accomplished. I should have taken the win and moved on with my life. But I just couldn't help myself. I needed to know.

I panned to the right of his name, where his address was. I felt my beer rising in my throat as I did. Next to his name and under ""current address"" was, Green Ridge Road.

The scariest house isn't always the one that looks like it. It's not always the dilapidated house with the dead lawn and shady looking tenets who won't make eye contact with you. Sometimes it's the house that's painted in the friendliest shade of soft yellow. The one that has an American flag perfectly flying from the porch. The one with the old man that comes out like clockwork to hand water his lawn. The house that you have no problem sending your kid to their front door for candy on Halloween. What is it they say about book covers?

Roger Davis was arrested for the murders of John and Jackie Miller, ages 9 and 8. Donna Zimmerman, age 7. Wayne Jackson, age 8. Susie Lee, age 8. Henry Parker, age 6. Almost sixty years after he committed the crimes. He was 86 at the time of his arrest.

I gave the police everything I had. They used fingerprints from Henry Parker's copy of ""The Rise and Fall of Ben Gizzard,"" that was left in our library, to match with some found on belongings of his that his diligent mother kept well preserved after all these years. Roger's prints were also a match on all of the kid's books, as well as the ""How to Swim and Dive"" manual we found in our little library.

Cadaver dogs hit on the area of the coordinates and they were able to recover the remains of all the children. My stomach still fills with shame and dread because I willingly brought my son to the burial site. I let him stand feet above the bones of murdered children as we played around on a pretend scavenger hunt.

We were in the middle of dinner weeks later when I heard the sirens. Flashing lights followed, reflecting off our walls. Our street doesn't get police activity very often, if at all. I knew who they were coming for.

It took me a couple of minutes to walk down my street and get to the house surrounded by the crime scene tape. As I approached, two officers walked out a slightly hunched, white-haired man, in handcuffs. He looked frail and confused, and unremarkable from any other elderly person in the community. He wasn't someone who looked like they would be getting arrested. The policemen closed the squad door behind him, regardless.

I observed him as he sat in the backseat of the cop car. He wasn't moving at all and he was seemingly focused on the nothingness in front of him. He stayed like this for an uncomfortable amount of time.

An officer told me he couldn't share any information on the case, not knowing that I was the one who revived the six cold cases with my findings. There wasn't much more for me to see, and it felt like it was time for me to head back home.

I looked one more time at Roger. I just wanted to burn into my eyes what evil could look like, so I never put my son in danger ever again. After a few seconds, the vile old man slowly started to turn his whole body towards the window. Towards me.

His face was blank and devoid of any humanity. He pointed his vacant and dark eyes at me. I could see the faintest bit of recognition from him once he saw me. I didn't want to look away. I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing fear on someone one last time. Even if I was terrified inside.

My last glimpse of him, before the car hauled him away, was the slow movement of his mouth forming the slightest, perverted, grin. He was enjoying this. He knew that he'd die soon, and he'd essentially got away with his crimes. I don't think that's what made him smile in that moment, though.

He knew that I'd see him again. Every time I watched someone leave a book in the Green Ridge Road Library for Cooper, or when Cooper's baseball coach pulls him aside to give him tips on his swing, or when I had parent-teacher conferences and met Cooper's teachers. He knew that I'd see him in every one of those people that I was trusting to be around my son.

He knew that's how he would live on.",2,1730244324.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

He cracked his knuckles showing off the words ‘Tuff Shit’ written across them. Brian scanned up his arms as he caught a very controversial tattoo on his shoulder that looked like it shouldn't be allowed in an airport. 

“Well I took his cards as collateral, until I get the school laptop I'm keeping the cards, it's as easy as that.” Brian was stern and direct with him. He stood towering over Brian. 

“Then what the fuck am I supposed to do, this isn't the first time he's stole something.” Brian was not this man's therapist. But he was a parent.

“Ok calm down, maybe just try to teach your kid the value of possessions, take things away from him when he acts up.” Brian got up as he pushed the guy outside his classroom. 

“I'm not done talking about this.” Brian did not have time to sit here all day. Brian told him to try his best then talk to him in a week. 

Brian bolted out of the school as fast as he could. He ran to his car and got on the road. Brian pulled out his phone calling the school. 

“Sorry I had something come up, I'll be there any minute.” Brian got a hold of the front desk in a panic state but she reassured everything was alright and Liam was with his music teacher. “Wooo, I love his music teacher.” Brian pulled up to the school and pulled directions from a yard duty as he walked fast on his feet. He passed rows of outside classrooms until he turned a corner. 

“That's my dad!” Liam's voice was welcoming but the person standing behind him wasn't. At least not to Brian. As Liam ran forward Brian pulled up his eyes. His feet stopped. He was motionless as Liam hugged him. Standing in the dirt was a woman. She had long black hair with short bangs above her thick black glasses. She was dressed in a pants suit but her sleeves were rolled up showing tattoos. The tattoos mirrored the tattoos of another as a skull with a bow caught his attention. Brian pulled his head back as he bit his lip. 

“Well hello Dad it's been a while,” Amber said, walking forward as she eyed him. Her voice was rougher than the last time they met but still cute as a button. 

“You know my dad?” Liam's question pulled Brian back to reality. Brian just mumbled, not able to speak.

“Yes Liam, me and your dad used to date,” Amber said, as she bent forward. Brian couldn't speak. It was sensory overload. 

“Oooooh, well come on Dad I want to go home.” Liam tugged on Brian trying to break him free from his trance. 

“See you later Dad,” Amber said, as she winked at him. Brian just gave a nervous laugh as his heartbeat roared. 

Surprisingly Liam had no more to say on the matter as they got in the car. Brian just stayed quiet as Liam watched a video on Brian's phone. When he finally got home Liam ran to his room. Sofia and Doge were on the couch talking. Brian just walked in front of them as they looked up. Brian pointed to the back patio as he gathered them outside. It was quiet until Brian spoke. 

“Amber is our son’s music teacher.” The girls looked on shocked. “I just saw her and she definitely remembers me.” 

“I didn't know she was in town,” Doge said, as she pulled out her phone. 

“When's the last time you saw her?” Sofia asked, leaning forward. Brian thought for a moment as his eyes dropped.

“The funeral I think.” Brian rubbed the back of his neck. Everyone got quiet. “She had her tattoos.” The air was still and dead. 

“Right but none of this matters, you're not gonna talk to her,” Sofia said, as she popped up from her chair. Like magic as her feet hit the floor Brian's phone buzzed. 

-Hi, it's Amber-
      Unknown number

Brian's face blushed as he set his phone down. Sofia took the phone showing it to Doge. Brian gripped his heart as he leaned over the edge. He wanted to throw up. 

“Alright dude this is up to you, we can't help you,” Sofia said, as she headed back inside with Doge. As Brian clang to the railing he remembered his son's words. Don't lean over the edge. As Brian echoed those words he noticed something. Under the balcony was a small groove with space. Something caught his eye. Brian hung a bit more as he traced his fingers along it. His hand stopped as he hit something. Brian pulled up half a pack of cigarettes. His feet carried themselves inside. Sofia and Doge were cuddling on the couch. 

“What the fuck is this?” Brian's words caught their attention. Sofia's eyes went wide as she sat up. “I don't even know what I'm looking at.” Sofia didn't know what to say. “So you lied to me, and now I can't trust you?” Brian held up the pack as he scrolled her. 

“Don't you fucking talk to me like that,” Sofia said, as she got in his face. 

“Ok I promise I won't talk to you like that, just like you promised me you quit smoking!” Sofia just stood glaring into his eyes. “I'm sorry I found out your secret.” Brian crumpled the pack in his hand. Liam was suddenly in the hallway watching.

“Is everything ok?” Liam's voice turned Sofia to him. She wanted to cry but tried not to. Sofia wanted to either slap Brian or collapse on the floor. Doge grabbed Liam leading him into his room. She chose as her hand came up quickly. Brian caught her arm midair. 

“Does it make you feel strong to hit someone? Because I'm a man it's ok to hit me?” Sofia struggled to break free but Brian wouldn't let go. 

“Let go of me!” She kicked and swung at him trying anything to get away. “I don't have to tell you anything!” 

“Oh is that the game we're playing?! Well I'll do the opposite, I'll tell you exactly what's wrong with me, I keep having nightmares that I'll lose all of you!” Sofia stopped as Brian pinched his eyes together. “And I'm scared that you won't need me anymore, that you might leave me all alone.” Sofia’s body relaxed as Brian let go of her. “We don't hang out like we used to.” Sofia just hugged him. Brian fell to his knees as Sofia followed. 

“I'm sorry sometimes I just need a break, I think what would help is if we just talked more about what's going on with us.” Sofia spoke softly as Liam and Doge appeared in the hall again. Liam just walked close as Sofia pulled him into a hug. Sofia kissed both men on their heads as she held them. “Mommy and Daddy are ok, we are just hashing things out together.” 

“I'm sorry for yelling bud,” Brian said, as he hugged Liam tight. Doge just stood awkwardly until Sofia called her over to the hug. Once everything was calm Sofia started dinner. Brian couldn't help but look at the lone text sitting on his phone. Brian sat at the bar watching Sofia cut carrots. “What do you think I should do?” Sofia didn't turn away from her cooking.

“Apple glaze.” Her two word sentence made his eyes roll as he got up to join her.

“No, about Amber.” Sofia had to think about this. “Should I block her?” Sofia dropped what she was doing and dried her hands. 

“You should ask her out, you love her right, take a chance, or sit here and think what if.” Sofia crossed her arms. Brian set his phone down on the text as he banged his head on the wall. Before he realized it Sofia picked up his phone typing away. Brian swiped the phone from her. His eyes scanned her text.

“Hello beautiful I've always been madly in love with you and want to share my life with you!” Brian read it out loud as his heart sank. Sofia smiled as she tapped his phone pointing to the name above. It said Sofia. 

“Got you,” she said, as she sent him a text. Brian’s blood slowly came back until he opened Amber's text. There was a response from Brian. It just said hi. 

“What did you do, I didn't want to text her.” Brian freaked out as he paced back and forth. And then she texted back.

-how's your day-
           Amber

She texted back so fast that blood reached Brian's cheek. Without thinking he texted her.

-just surviving-
          Brian

The texts began back and forth as Sofia smiled watching him sit at the bar. 

-I’m sure you have a lot of questions-
         Brian

-Not really I stalk your profile, I understand your set up dude-
         Amber

Brian didn't know how to respond. He just thought about the perfect response until she responded first.

-I knew Liam was yours, he's cute just like you-
       Amber

Brian's heart skipped a beat as he slid off the stool. His legs circled around the room as he texted her. 

-I have missed you-
      Brian

Brian's eyes went wide as he hit send. He watched the three dots appear and disappeared as he tried to pull his hair out. It felt like forever when in reality it was one minute.

-good keep it that way-
      Amber

Her words were inviting yet also somehow standoffish. Brian was on the edge of a cliff until she texted again.

-I like my pet wining for me to return home-
       Amber

Brian's body became stiff as he covered his mouth. He stood, legs shaking, trying not to scream. 

“You two seemed to be hitting it off,” Sofia said, as she covered the stove. Brian just nodded as he moved to the couch. 

-I’m sitting with my family right now-
        Brian

-Oh really, I guess I can behave just tell me how to act-
        Amber 

This last text calmed him. And then he read it again and again. And then it seemed so sinister. Brian just took a deep breath before texting her back.

-I’ll text you after dinner-    
       Brian

Amber responded with a kiss emoji. Not a heart kiss emoji. Just a regular kiss emoji. Brian decided to respond the same but accidentally hit the heart kiss emoji. Panic set in as he waited. Four minutes passed until she responded. 

-🥰-
     Amber

His heart melted as he melted into the couch. Everyone piled around Brian as the food was done. Even PJ made himself known as he crawled into Liam's lap begging for food. When food was done Brian began cleaning the dishes while Sofia got Liam ready for bed. 

“Gggggoooollll.” Liam's words came out gargled as he brushed his teeth. Sofie pushed him back into the bathroom as he spit. “Goodnight Dad.”

“Goodnight bud.” Brian wished him goodnight as he scrubbed away in the sink. It didn't take long for Sofia to put Liam to bed. Sofia crawled into a bar stool rubbing her hands together.

“Nine years.” Her words resonated with Brian as he turned to her. “You don't know anything about the nine years between them and now.” Brian kept his hands on the sink.

“She's been stalking me, but hasn't made contact this whole time, knew Liam was ours, presumably has had my number for a while, but once we made contact she began texting me.” Brian shifted to the bar as he held up his phone. “At least the nine years gives us something to talk about.” Sofia just grabbed his hand. 

“And you guys are starting up like nothing happened?” Sofia’s question gave Brian a bit of anxiety. 

“This morning I was just trying to figure out how to deal with an angry parent, now I'm excited to get a text from a girl.” Sofia rubbed his hand consoling him. “I just wanted to be there for her, and now maybe she wants to be there for me.” Sofia pulled away as she walked to the hallway. 

“Do you love her?” Brian just lowered his head. He knew exactly how to answer but wasn't sure she could handle it. 

“When I saw her I could feel my heart wanting to pop out of my chest, and she could have just brushed me off, but instead she texted me like she was waiting for me to find her, like to reassure her I still felt the same, I don't think there's a question of if I love her, the question is can I handle it.” Sofia nodded before leaving him alone in the kitchen. Brian stood motionless surrounded by pots and pans as he waited for a girl to text him back. 

Her eyes sparked as the oncoming lights painted morales on the walls. She rolled over hugging the cover of a wheel. Her blanket could barely keep out the cold outside air. 

He woke up to nothing. Not a sound. It was twenty minutes before his alarm would ring. Food prep started as music took over the living room. Liam came out with tired eyes wondering what was going on. He shuffled like a deer on ice as he swung around a spatula. It didn't take long for Sofia to burst out of her room.

“What is going on?” Her question was answered when she saw him high on his tiptoes.

“May I have this dance?” He asked, as he pulled her close. Sofia didn't know how to react. Goosebumps formed as he spun her in the living room. Sofia lost herself as she grabbed Liam pulling him into a mamba.  Doge left her room next only to be immediately pulled into a dance by Sofia. 

“What are we doing?!” Liam's booming voice was filled with confusion.

“Dancing!” Brian shouted as eggs burned behind him. 

She stopped her alarm as cars honked in distance. Her eyes saw everything in a blur until she put them on. Once she was met with the morning darkness a emptiness set in. She dragged herself up the steep steps like she did every morning. Once her keys opened the door a messy sight came into view. It was one room with only a bathroom and a tiny kitchen. Clothes were scattered hiding instruments and cooking ware. She plucked up a toothbrush as she opened the empty fridge. As she finished getting ready a pop tart shot out of the toaster. Once jam was applied her phone buzzed. Amber unlocked her phone as a text popped up.

-I had a dream about you-
            Brian

Everyone rushed out the door ready to start the day. Doge met Kitty at the bottom of the stairs. The sisters climbed into Kitty's two door as Sofia kissed Doge goodbye. Once everyone was on their way to school Brian flicked on an audiobook.

He slammed the door as it echoed through the halls. He stepped over a body laying on the floor only to be stopped by a ladle hanging out of a doorway. 

“That’s what’s fast Jack, soup coming in hot.” A langy tall man who looked molded from dirt hung out of his shirt. 

“Work.” This one word pulled the ladle from the hallway.

“Chill chill, more Jack more,” he said, slapping a big greasy pot. Jack nodded and kept on his way. 

I’m never hungry anymore. It only brings back bad memories. 

The sun blasted Jack in the face as he made it into the outside world. Pulling down his hat more helped but didn’t matter as a blimp already blocked the sun. Jack ruffled his coat as the wind flew by. His eyes took in the filthy street. Electric bikes raced by the people sleeping in the streets. Lights were ignored by cars. A veil of smoke kept the civilians from the gods. Jack started on his right foot only to drag himself into an alley. 

Brian turned down the stereo as they approached the school. Sofia and Brian wished Liam a wonderful day as he left the car. Brian turned his noise back up as they got on the highway.

“Keep it simple Jack.” His words were quick. The messy haired clerk held his hand under the desk like he was holding onto something. 

“I need the bike,” Jack said, pulling on his face. The clerk relaxed his hands. Jack let his eyes drift to the name tag. Ricky didn’t seem nervous, more fed up with Jack’s appearance. 

“I have plans tonight.”

“I’ll bring it back.” Jack’s growly voice did not ease Ricky’s mind. Ricky pulled his hair back.

“Five, a quarter before I’m holding you to it,” Ricky said, reaching into his pocket and tossing keys onto the table. Jack nodded as he grabbed the keys and made for the door. 

Staying unseen was not hard for Jack if he could keep up to it. The buffoon from earlier made himself known. He shouted at Jack. The steps are what kept his eyes not the big man following him. 

“Did you sleep good?” Sofia asked, with a big smile as she turned down the audiobook. Brian also had a smile he couldn't hide. He just stared at the road. 

“I slept well.” Sofia just looked forward trying to quell her excitement. Once they got to work Brian walked fast to his room. He set up his projector and got note paper ready.

“Boom look who's setting up a movie day.” Dave's voice boomed as he pulled himself inside.

“Oh yeah I got an interesting little movie with learning written all over it,” Brian said, as he sat on the corner of his desk. 

“You should see the movies I've gotten to play, I can make anything look educational.” The bell rang as the pair dispersed leaving room for kids to fill the room.

Once everything was quiet Sofia could hear herself think. The teachers lounge made a perfect location for her to catch up on her show. Her phone propped up against her coffee as audio played. She got lost in her media until a voice pulled her back.

“Nice productivity.” Luscious’ voice echoed from the fridge. He pulled his hair back as he made himself a sandwich. 

“You try my job, it's hard work, why aren't you watching your class?” Luscious pulled up next to her in a chair as he ate.

“I've got a movie going, my para is watching them, I didn't get to eat this morning,” he said, licking mayo off his fingers. Sofia paused her show. 

“Your husband doesn't cook you breakfast like mine does?” Sofia gave him the right amount of snark. Luscious just laughed.

“Bradley doesn't know his way around an oven sadly, and I was in a hurry this morning.” The pair kept the conversation light until Sofia noticed the time. She grabbed her stuff as she said goodbye. 

Sofia scurried down the halls. She passed by kids rushing around as the bell rang. Sofia slid up to the gym storage room as girls crowded around.

“Sorry girls, I'm here.” She unlocked the door as the girls rushed in to grab batons and pompoms. Sofia led the cheerleaders into the open gym as she pulled her boom box along. Sofia popped on music as the girls danced back and forth randomly until she could corral them into their routine. Sofia mimicked their motions softly. 

“Hey Ms. Gardener?” One of the voices popped up. Sofia slowed to a stop as she grabbed everyone's attention. “You’re not married right?” Before Sofia could say anything another voice piped up.


“She's married to the cute history teach in the West Wing.” This voice brought snickers with it as the girls couldn't contain themselves. 

“Ok ladies listen up, I am not married, yet, Mr. Fader is my best friend. We are not together.” All the girls hushed up as they pulled themselves closer. “In fact, not that it's any of your business, but I have a girlfriend.” The girls giggled until she shut them up with stretches.

Years ago my father picked me up at my place to go for lunch with me. I found out on the ride to the restaurant that my dad was no longer sober, he was quite drunk after a year of sobriety, his longest stretch yet. By the time I realized he was drunk, we were driving down Macleod. I opted for something very close. 

At the restaurant he made racist comments about Asian people the whole time, made a general ass of himself, acted drunk and belligerent. I tried to curb his racism by changing subjects but he kept finding his way back to. I did the best I could to keep him off the subject of Asian people, but he kept saying things I won't repeat here. It wasn't hateful, but it was quite ignorant. 

He popped up to go to the bathroom and while he was out I apologized to the only other person in earshot, a lone Asian woman who was sitting nearby and likely heard everything. It was incredibly uncomfortable. She accepted my apology and expressed understanding. 

When we went up to pay I found out that this woman had already paid for us. I'm not exactly sure why. 

But to hear racist comments for a half hour from a drunken idiot at noon, to accept an awkward apology, then to cover lunch for said racist old man and his awkward adult son... I think that's something commendable. 

I don't know why you did it, but the gesture has sat with me for years and I am forever grateful. I'm not sure if you'll ever read this, but your kindness meant a lot to me that day. 

My dad had cancer. He got drunk after his diagnosis and was acting out. He died a year ago now. 

If anyone was wondering, afterwards I convinced my dad to walk to my house, where I fed him coffee until he took a nap, sobered up, and I walked him to his car. I never acknowledged to his face that it was obvious he was plastered. 

Thank you kind stranger. Though a person like you has likely left good impressions everywhere, and I doubt you even remember me. ",202,1730243410.0,Calgary,8,0.96,False

I've never had a ton of experience with automatic machines, but TK-02 seems to be the best bet. I can still dial in all the parameters like grind size, volume, temp, etc, so I can still scratch that itch of customization without needing to have a scale, WDT tool, and so on.

The stock’s price is up 47% year-to-date, and while it’s not the best-performing bank stock of the universal banks (that honor belongs to **Chinabank** [CBC 58.00 ▼0.8%; 59% avgVol], which is up 87% YTD), it’s kept pace with **BPI** [BPI 147.20 ▼0.1%; 125% avgVol], outperformed **BDO** [BDO 157.00 ▼1.9%; 93% avgVol], and stomped **Union Bank** [UBP 36.55 ▼6.2%; 310% avgVol]. But even UBP, which is down 33% YTD, has made over ₱8 billion in 9M/24 profit. Our banks (and the families that own them) are literally swimming in **Scrooge McDuck** vaults of profit. Maybe I’m still just salty that our banking industry’s regulator, the **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas** (BSP), has not taken the outrageous profitability of our banking sector as an opportunity to eliminate fees for small value transactions that disproportionately tax the financial transactions of the poor and of the “unbanked” sector that everyone is so desperate to claw into the system.

>- **[NEWS]  Cebu Pacific takes control of 1Aviation with ₱113M debt-to-equity conversion...** **Cebu Pacific** [CEB 32.25 ▼2.0%; 70% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1a815e8bb2450ef8abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] disclosed that it increased its ownership stake in **1Aviation Groundhandling Services Corporation** (1AV) from 40% to 60% through the conversion of debt to equity. The transaction gave CEB 1.13 million 1AV shares valued at ₱113 million, and more importantly, gave CEB a controlling interest in the ground handling business that operates in 34 airports and has 6,224 employees. CEB said that the transaction would “improve [1AV’s] financial health”, and “strengthen [CEB’s] management influence to enable it to more effectively integrate 1AV’s services with its operations.” The Gokongwei Family’s airline added that the move would “reduce its operational costs while improving its service quality.”
>    - ***MB:*** There are a lot of possible reasons for this move, but based on what’s public, it makes a lot of sense (to me) for CEB to seek control of the ground handling services for its planes given how complicated (and expensive) it must get to coordinate ground services amid all the delays and flight cancellations caused by typhoons and other storms that are only going to get stronger and more frequent as the years go by. It still doesn’t make a lot of sense to me as an investor to own airlines, but so it goes. 1AV isn’t a huge company (the debt-to-equity conversion implies an enterprise value of around ₱565 million), but it likely has an outsized impact on the quality of life of CEB and (more importantly) CEB’s passengers.

>- **[QUESTION]  How do ex-dates work?...** This is a great question, and one that usually finds its way into my inbox whenever **Semirara Mining and Power** [SCC 31.95 ▼0.6%; 114% avgVol] declares a dividend. To understand what an ex-date is, we first need to understand that a stock is really just a bundle of rights that (usually) include the right to dividends, the right to vote on major company decisions, the right to a residual claim on the company’s assets in the case of liquidation. There are a lot of other rights that could be included there, but those are the big ones. When a company declares a dividend, it declares a dividend to each share--not to any specific shareholders--so the issue that arises when the shares can be freely traded on the exchange is obviously going to be: who gets the dividend? The ex-date solves that problem. The “ex” part means “without”, so just think of this date as the “without dividend date”. If the most-recent SCC dividend has an ex-date of October 28, that means anybody who purchased the stock on October 28 (or later) bought the stock “without dividends” attached. To be eligible to receive the dividend, you would have had to purchase the SCC shares before October 28. Since October 28 was a Monday, in this case, that would have meant owning SCC shares by the end of the trading day on Friday, October 25.
>    - ***MB:*** It’s my personal opinion that ex-dates are the scariest part of dividend investing. My first attempt to buy a stock for a dividend was when I was in my 20s, and I bought the stock on the ex-date thinking that I was a financial genius. It was heartbreaking and demoralizing to realize, weeks later, that all I did was buy the underlying stock. No sweet dividends rained down upon my portfolio. Only shame. I think the ex-date complication is more pressing for traders who are looking to run some kind of “dividend capture” trading strategy, where one might buy the stock just before the ex-date and sell it soon after when the price adjusts. But there aren’t many of these traders. If you’re like me--the new me, not the old ex-date buying me--then you are mostly likely to simply sit on your dividend-generating stocks for months and years at a time and ex-dates don’t even cross your mind.

Like the thought of having to use the restroom is horrific, and I just wanna curl up and cry. 

During the day I go and sometimes I’m left with discomfort after sometimes not. At night it’s literally a nightmare, I’m scared to drink water before I sleep but either way I practically live in the bathroom. 

Ive gotten tested for UTI, and came back negative. And I did at home test, and negative again. It was to the point I was hoping the doctor would of said it was that, just so I can get rid of it. 

I don’t even really know when this started, I remember starting the year with no issues and then all of a sudden for days and weeks I have to pee like constantly, and I never felt discomfort at that time, just peed a lot. I could drink whatever and not feel uncomfortable after, and the list goes on. And then one day it was just discomfort after going and feeling like I have trapped pee inside of me. It feels like a permanent UTI and it makes me want to scream. Like all it is, is the constant urge to pee and then feeling like I have to after 

But the thing is I don’t even know if it’s IC. Because my symptoms can look like a lot of things. A lot of people dealing with IC say they’re in pain and they feeling burning, which I don’t think I do? And since my issues with being able to go to the doctor and have that, I’m just stuck taking supplements and drowning myself with water, and no signs of improvement. 

I understand it’s bad to read things on the internet and “self diagnose”. But I don’t know if it’s IC or something that could easily be fixed. I’ve read that it could be endometriosis (could be a possibility because it runs in my family) or yeast infection, so many things. And I just don’t know. And some even say stress can make things worse if it is IC, and I’m going through a stressful time which makes sense if it is IC and it’s stress related 

I’m tired of feeling scared to eat foods, and only drinking water. I can’t enjoy anything at all. It’s literally ruining my life. I see people that don’t have to think twice about drinking a soda or coffee, and I’m jealous. I hate this, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. If anyone has input please help.
