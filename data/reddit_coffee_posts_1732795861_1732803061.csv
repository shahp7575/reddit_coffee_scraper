The other times I’ve tried to stop I never wanted to be honest with the closest people around me. But now I was honest I told my boyfriend about my issues with drinking and my two close friends. It felt like a relief getting it off my chest and knowing that they are happy to support me. So yeah I’ve done a whole week which is great as I haven’t had a week off in like three months since I last tried to quit for a bit. I feel much better and feel motivated to do things that I enjoy like; learning languages, playing the bass guitar and tennis as well as a bit of studying and exercise. Hopefully I can keep this, and I’m gonna celebrate by getting myself a coffee !!!",1,1732803007.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False
1h1wr4l,https://i.redd.it/5krxkoiygn3e1.jpeg,How would Mayor Joines suggest a pedestrian cross University Parkway or Hanes Mill BLVD from the bus stop?,"Seriously, can someone help me figure out a way to actually get an answer from him on this? I want him to look at this, where the bus stop is, and advise how one can get to anything in that area without endangering their lives. I don’t want to subsidize services like Uber when my tax dollars go towards the bus system and it goes within 1/4 mile of my destination. It is pitiful that the city has not at least been ATTEMPTING to make sure intersections in the immediate vicinity of BUS STOPS are not signaled for pedestrian crossings, provided with sidewalks and curbs cuts, and a proper painted crossing lane. Hell, just do two sides, just make it *possible* to not put my life in jeopardy just to cross a damn road please. 

My thought is, that after 20+ years of him being mayor he may have given some thought to this or intersections like this at one point in time or another. 

This thanksgiving I am thankful as a non-car driving pedestrian/cyclist/transit user in this city to have not been mowed down by an inattentive or even worse downright homocidal driver…yet.

Until we can get city leadership actually focused on solving years of neglectful planning, Ya’ll drivers in the area really need to stop being so awful to pedestrians on the road. Yes, you do have to yield. No, you shouldn’t speed to a crosswalk to beat a pedestrian. Even if there is no marked crossing, you still have to stop for a pedestrian who is crossing, even on the parkways and boulevards of this city.it is crucial to do so on multi lane roadways and to use your hazards to alert other drivers of a crossing pedestrian. Most pedestrian deaths are because one car stops or slows down but another car in another lane sails through, not aware that the other car is stopped for a pedestrian. Please be reminded that often there are no marked crossing for literally miles of sections of roads. Sometimes people have no choice but to do a Hail Mary and cross 5 lanes of 45 mph traffic. Yielding is NOT an inconvenience to you, it is a privilege to be driving a vehicle… remember that, you’ll wish you had when you’re the next one to have mowed down a pedestrian in your unnecessarily large land yacht as you whip out of Starbucks. 

If you haven’t, try walking along University Parkway. It is truly one of the most terrifying experiences you’ll have. And imagine being a service worker in one of those stores, relying on that local bus stop to get to and from work everyday, and having to cross that nightmare of roadways, only 1/4 mile. Do you really need to make that poor persons day worse by being a dick in your car to them? Really?",1,1732802996.0,winstonsalem,0,1.0,False

Local Teacher Shocked to Learn She Might Be the Second Coming of Jesus

[Unnamed Town, USA] — Middle school teacher Laura Jensen (29) had always thought of herself as a fairly average person: a dedicated educator, a reluctant PTA member, and an enthusiastic fan of Target clearance sales. So, it came as quite a shock when biblical scholars suggested she might, in fact, be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

“It’s absurd,” Jensen said as she graded essays on The Giver at her kitchen table. “I mean, sure, I’ve had moments where my students swore I performed miracles, like calming an entire room of eighth-graders during a fire drill. But that’s just classroom management.”

Scholars disagree. Dr. Emily Rutherford, a theologian at Bethel University, points to several biblical clues that align eerily well with Jensen’s life. “Matthew 25:40 says, ‘Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ Laura literally spends her days feeding hungry kids from her own pocket and listening to them vent about Fortnite. If that’s not Christlike, I don’t know what is.”

Laura’s coworkers began to suspect her divine nature after a series of inexplicable events. Fellow teacher Mark Hanson recalled the time Laura somehow coordinated a successful field trip with only $47 and a prayer. “We were three buses short, and she just stood in the parking lot, looking to the sky, and said, ‘We’ll make it work.’ Five minutes later, three drivers showed up out of nowhere. She called it ‘luck.’ I call it divine intervention.”

Other colleagues noted her uncanny ability to de-escalate fights in the cafeteria with nothing but a look. “It’s like she knows what the kids are thinking before they say it,” said cafeteria worker Denise Hall. “One time, a kid was about to throw chocolate milk, and she just said, ‘Matthew, no.’ He froze like a statue and handed her the carton.”

Despite these signs, Jensen remains unconvinced. “Look, I’m not perfect. Last week, I forgot it was pajama day and showed up in regular clothes,” she said. “Does that sound like someone who’s divine?”

Theologians argue that Jensen’s disbelief in her own identity is rooted in modern society’s tendency to undervalue teachers. “If she were a tech CEO, people would be lining up to follow her,” said Dr. Rutherford. “But as a public school teacher, she’s been conditioned to see her daily miracles as just part of the job.”

Meanwhile, parents of her students are torn. “I mean, she did help my kid get from failing to an A in math,” said one parent. “But if she’s really the Messiah, can she do something about this state testing nonsense?”

Jensen’s humble attitude is perhaps the strongest evidence yet. “Isaiah 53:2 says the Messiah will have no beauty or majesty to attract us to her,” noted Dr. Rutherford. “Well, Laura wears Crocs in the classroom and hasn’t had a haircut since the pandemic. That fits.”

For now, Jensen plans to continue teaching, grading, and gently reminding her students to put their phones away during lessons. “If I’m the Second Coming of Christ, I wish someone had let me know,” she said. “I would’ve at least tried to figure out how to turn water into coffee.”

Until then, she’s just thankful for her students, her coworkers, and the freedom to laugh at life’s absurdities. And if she is the Messiah, she’s prepared to show infinite patience—especially with seventh graders who still haven’t figured out how to open their lockers.",1,1732802924.0,Teachers,0,1.0,False

It sparked widespread interest for its potential to promote fat burning and enhance brain function, leaving many people wondering how to use MCT oil effectively.

Let’s explore the benefits of MCT oil and learn how to incorporate this supplement into your routine to maximize its health benefits.

**What is MCT oil?**

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a type of saturated fat comprising three medium-chain fatty acids bonded to a glycerol molecule. 

Unlike long-chain triglycerides, MCTs can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream without requiring bile or pancreatic enzymes to break them down. 

Although not classified as essential fatty acids, MCTs are directly converted into ketones, a group of organic acids that support sustained energy, enhance mental clarity, and promote a feeling of fullness by stimulating the release of satiety-inducing hormones. 

  
While small amounts of MCTs are naturally found in coconut oil, bovine milk, and palm kernel oil, MCT oil is a concentrated extract that provides a higher and more consistent dose of these beneficial fats. 

  
MCT oil can consist of several different types of medium-chain fatty acids, including:

* Caproic acid (C6)
* Caprylic acid (C8)
* Capric acid (C10)
* Lauric acid (C12)



The numbers associated with each fatty acid represent the amount of carbon atoms in their chemical structure. This plays a critical role in how the body processes these fats and the benefits they provide. For instance, caproic acid is the shortest medium-chain fatty acid and converts into ketones the quickest, offering a rapid energy source. 

However, caproic acid is rare and challenging to extract, and its lower carbon count gives it a strong taste and odor, which makes it less appealing. As a result, it's usually not found in many MCT oil products. In contrast, lauric acid is one of the most abundant fatty acids found in coconut oil. While it converts to ketones slower than C6, C8, and C10, it has no distinct flavor, and its higher carbon count offers powerful antimicrobial effects.



# How to use MCT oil



Due to its neutral taste and high potency, MCT oil is incredibly versatile. You can quickly enjoy its energy-boosting benefits by incorporating MCT oil into your meals or drinks, taking it straight from the spoon, or using it as a dietary supplement.

However, if your goal is weight loss, you'll see the best results by combining MCT oil with other strategies, such as [Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/resources/beginners-guide-to-healthy-keto-intermittent-fasting?queryID=5a26ee7b451a2fa8c0f81baeca5d60e1&objectID=res_17). These methods work together to fast-track your body into fat-burning and optimize metabolic health. 

According to [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523235339) published in *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, “a weight-loss diet that incorporates moderate amounts of MCT oil leads to greater losses of body weight and fat mass than does consumption of an equivalent amount of olive oil.”*

One of the most popular uses of MCT oil is blending it into your morning coffee, a practice known as [bulletproof coffee](https://www.drberg.com/blog/my-bulletproof-coffee-hack?queryID=b219f911fc32cd7ddef68e28808739dc&objectID=blog_2645). 

Bulletproof coffee is especially popular among those who practice intermittent fasting while following a ketogenic diet. It helps curb hunger, boost ketone production, and prevent brain fog, making it easier to extend fasting periods and maintain focus throughout the day.  Another great way to use MCT oil is to add it to salad dressings, smoothies, [fat bombs](https://www.drberg.com/blog/keto-fat-bombs?queryID=59afa087ec785b4e3858a8c70712b98e&objectID=blog_5715), or other keto-friendly dishes to increase your intake of healthy fats and promote ketosis. 

  


# Benefits of MCT oil

Regularly consuming MCT oil can offer a range of health benefits whether you're following a strict ketogenic diet or not.  
  
Here are three potential benefits of adding MCT oil to your daily routine.

# 1. Supports weight loss and metabolic health

MCT oil is a powerful tool to support weight loss and promote metabolic health.  
  
*“By stimulating ketone production, reducing hunger, and stabilizing insulin levels, MCT oil helps your body to burn fat instead of storing it,”* explains Dr. Berg.  
  
This approach is especially effective when paired with a metabolic-enhancing diet such as [Healthy Keto](https://www.drberg.com/blog/healthy-keto-plan-start-here?queryID=3528ceb72d5a7f1c7ab18a1ff24e0d63&objectID=blog_2688), which reduces carbohydrate intake to promote fat burning and prevent the body from shifting into fat storage mode.

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561424002085) published in *Clinical Nutrition* found that diets that regularly include MCT oil led to significant weight loss, reductions in blood triglycerides, and improved insulin sensitivity in obese individuals. 

Moreover, a [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/7/1091) published in *Foods* demonstrated significant metabolic improvements in children with glycogen storage disease type 1 after MCT oil was incorporated into their diet plan. Researchers observed *“outstanding outcomes in ameliorating biochemical results, such as normalizing serum glucose, lactate and uric acid and a significant reduction in concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol.”*

# 2. Promotes cognitive function

[Evidence](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/22/12310) published in the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* indicates that the steady production of ketones associated with MCT oil intake may offer profound neuroprotective effects. Ketones are well-known for providing the brain with steady, longer-lasting energy. Unlike glucose, ketone bodies don’t cause blood sugar spikes that can lead to energy crashes and increase the risk of insulin resistance.

This is crucial as insulin resistance is associated with a higher risk of cognitive issues and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. MCT-derived ketones not only enhance mental clarity and focus but also may have the potential to prevent or slow cognitive decline linked to age-related memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease.



# 3. Enhance athletic performance

Because MCTs quickly convert into ketones, athletes often use them as a pre-workout supplement to boost their energy levels, enabling them to tackle more intense workouts.

Additionally, when combined with a keto diet, MCT oil can support healthy and sustainable muscle growth by promoting stable insulin levels. This is critical as insulin plays a vital role in protein synthesis, muscle repair, and recovery.

# How much MCT oil should you take?

  
MCT oil is a concentrated source of fat, and a little goes a long way. 

It’s generally recommended to start with one teaspoon of MCT oil per day and gradually increase to 1 to 2 tablespoons daily as your body adjusts. It’s essential to allow your body time to adapt to significant changes in fat intake, as [eating too much fat](https://www.drberg.com/blog/9-signs-that-you-are-eating-too-much-fat?queryID=4b231d3f2fd52cebfccb285c95e2ef09&objectID=blog_2401) too quickly can lead to issues such as nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and gallbladder pain. 



# When not to use MCT oil 

While MCT oil can support weight loss and energy metabolism, there are signs that you should avoid or limit your consumption. 

Excessive fat intake can diminish weight loss as the body prioritizes the metabolism of dietary fats over stored body fat, and hitting a weight loss plateau may be linked to taking too much MCT oil. Additionally, digestive issues, such as diarrhea, nausea, or bloating, could be triggered by large MCT oil doses or indicate that your body hasn’t adapted to the increased fat intake. 



Therefore, it’s crucial to listen to your body and adjust your MCT oil consumption accordingly to minimize the risk of adverse health effects. It’s also important to discuss the use of MCT oil supplementation with a healthcare provider, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking prescription medications. 



It sparked widespread interest for its potential to promote fat burning and enhance brain function, leaving many people wondering how to use MCT oil effectively. Let’s explore the benefits of MCT oil and learn how to incorporate this supplement into your routine to maximize its health benefits.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1732802485.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

1h1wixm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1h1wixm/13_more_miscellaneous_arcana_reviews/,13 more miscellaneous Arcana reviews,"Happy American Thanksgiving to those who celebrate! I'm writing this snuggled up with one of my rabbits on a heating pad (she gets cold and can't digest properly, and then refuses to eat, so it is often my happy task to sit with her and help her warm up) and a wool blanket, which is the most marvelously cozy start to this holiday.

I generally prefer to review by collection when I can, but sometimes I end up with a whole bunch of random scents from a house over time, and then I get to put up a big ""miscellaneous"" review, which is fun too! Here are my thoughts on 13 more Arcana scents (my last ""miscellaneous"" review post for Arcana, covering 26 scents, can be found [HERE](https://new.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ekc95p/26_miscellaneous_arcana_reviews_in_which_i_gush/)). As I said last time, the thing about Arcana is that a lot of them don't work for me, but the ones that work really *WORK* \- several of my all-time top favorite holy grails come from this house. And while I've been learning which notes to actively *avoid* from Arcana, and I can occasionally predict which perfumes will *definitely* work for me (**But a Dream**, **Moth-Like Stars**, and **Strawberries Crave Love Potions** for a few examples - and it hasn't escaped my attention that all of those feature their cashmere or silk notes), I can't always predict if something that sounds *potentially* interesting will end up working for me or not. So as always, I remain so, so grateful for decanters and destashers, and also for the fact that for a while now, Arcana has been selling sample sizes of their new releases (though they do tend to sell out fast and aren't always restocked).

We *still* haven't heard yet who the new distributor for Arcana Craves will be, and I sincerely hope that will actually materialize, so I'm including several Craves reviews here too in the hope that they will end up being useful. Thanks to a kind friend who decanted me a sample of **On the Wing**, I also had a chance to try an Arcana EDP for the first time; that review (including a comparison to its parent scent, **Moth-Like Stars**, is at the very bottom).

**My preferences:** I especially love snuggly scents, incense, golden amber, cardamom, black tea, beeswax, non-gourmand vanillas, and white florals (especially honeysuckle, plumeria, tiare, and tuberose; though sadly I am allergic to lilies and jasmine doesn’t usually work on me). I don't like hay, overly sweet gourmands, butter notes, excessive musk, leather, dragon’s blood, patchouli, labdanum, or any really dark scents in general.

# Arcana Craves

**Blueberries Crave Surf** \[Fresh blackberries and crushed blueberries with Arcana's Surf perfume (orange blossoms with beach coconut, skin musk, and warm sand)\] - Hello berries, with coconut sunscreen and somehow a hint of bell pepper (possibly it's more a neroli than an orange blossom?). It's super summery, but also sweeter than I'd anticipated, and unlike my other favorite blackberry and blueberry scents from Arcana (**Nectar**, **Miss Skiffins**, **Blueberries Crave Goblin Sharks**), these berries are uncomfortably artificial to my nose. I could deal with that, honestly, and they calm down really quickly, but I can't handle the bell-peppery note - the more I sniff my wrist, the more I think that's how my nose is interpreting the orange blossom + sand - so to the destash this went.

**Pumpkins Crave Rouge** \[A saucy melange of bright, brash raspberry with juicy plum, dewy rose petals, berry musk, sweet amber, pink pumpkin, and blush velvet\] - Oh, I like this! It's a very pink scent, and thoroughly NOT autumnal - how very cool, a pumpkin scent not for fall! It's a jammy pink rose (my favorite kind of rose!) and a burst of red raspberry, and the creamy pumpkin base doesn't really read to my nose as pumpkin (no pumpkin spice here to help with that association) but more as a pink amber. This feels very girlish and frothy and thoroughly delightful. It's going to be a transitional scent for me, summer to fall, a period when I start longing for pumpkin everything but it's still absurdly hot and humid here where I live.

# Arcana Wildcraft

**Afterglow** \[The soft euphoria of white amber, vanilla bean, vanilla milk, Malbec grapes, Arcana's own Lust blend, cognac absolute, and a drop of cool peppermint\] - A strong and unfortunately artificial purple grape note and a really menthol-y, almost antiseptic mint (not just a drop; it's so much that it read a bit doctor's office-y to me) over a base of musky white amber. Boo, this one doesn't work for me. In the drydown, the grape and mint recede and a glowing golden cognac appears (familiar from other Arcanas like **Estella** and similar to the rum in **Sitting Pretty**).

**Astrid's Diadem** \[A bright sparkler of Madagascar vanilla, Bourbon vanilla, sugared lavender creme, citron, lemongrass, peppermint, and a touch of stately patchouli\] - I'm getting gentle mint and lavender in a bath of soft, creamy white chocolate, with undercurrents of white patchouli (like that in **Eir**) to keep it from being too monochromatic or cloying. This is what I'd wanted **Glittering Lavender** to be. It's a beautiful, serene lavender-mint, and surprisingly strong. I've heard a lot of reviews say that this is a really refreshing scent in summer, but personally I plan to wear it in January/February alongside my other wintery mint scents. In the drydown, lemon and orange zests appear, making it less serene and more bright and cheerful.

**Golden Apple** \[A perfect, crisp, non-spicy apple is gilded with brown sugar, warm cardamom, and organic vetiver\] - I got nervous about this one, sniffing it in the vial, because I got quite a lot of dirt-like vetiver, but on my skin the vetiver is more black-peppery than earthy, and it balances the sweet gourmand-ness of the stewed yellow apples (""crisp"" apple this is not - definitely a cooked apple). I could use more cardamom (is my constant cry!). This all being said, there are plenty of other fall-atmospheric and cardamom-forward perfumes I like more, so I didn't keep this one - but I'm really happy to have tried it. (It was also a good reminder that I like the *idea* of apple perfumes, but very rarely actually like them.)

**Holy Terror** \[An unsettling, austere blend of burning frankincense, sandalwood, deep myrrh, and dusty beeswax candles\] - This incense is quite smoky and almost medicinal. I tried it once in **Vanilla Craves Terror** and was really turned off by it, but I thought at the time that it was due to the conflict between the vanilla and the incense. Nope - it turns out I just *really* don't like **Holy Terror**, which is interesting because I do have a few Arcana incense scents (**Haul**, **Beautiful Ruin**) that I love. **Holy Terror** sort of turns my stomach. Well, at least now I know! And I'll know to avoid anything in future that includes **Holy Terror** as a note. I know this one is a *huge* crowd favorite so honestly I wouldn't take my word for it, if I were you. If you like incense perfumes, this one is a classic in the indie world, and very much worth trying.

**Moon Queen** \[A luminous blend of cool vanilla creme, moonlight infused coconut water, rich coconut gelato, translucent silk woven with silver threads, and softly beating wings. A creamy coconut-vanilla with gentle silk\] - Yep, silky coconut, glassy and cool. It's very straightforward - I really only get these two notes - but it's really pretty, and extremely peaceful. I can see loving this in the heat of summer for cool refreshment, but also in the depths of winter as a snowy scent. The heat of my skin warms it as it dries, and eventually instead of a cool, standoffish silky coconut, it becomes a warm, almost snuggly silky coconut. And the longevity is spectacular, which I didn't expect - it lasts long into the afternoon, becoming a white ambery-sweet coconut in the deep, deep drydown. A quiet beauty.

**Mountain Witch** \[Roasted black coffee beans with a swirl of woody incense, wild-harvested spruce needles, fir balsam absolute, green moss, damp firewood, soft earth, and a hint of Oregon wildflowers\] - A freshly-brewed cup of coffee backed with spruce, incense, and dirt. Arcana consistently has gorgeous evergreen notes, and this is no exception. This scent is interesting lighter, less robust overall than I had imagined from seeing the notes. It's a shy mountain witch, not a shouty one. The dirt held this one back from joining my collection, but it did make me want to go wear **Daydreams of Trees**, my favorite Arcana evergreen scent. Gosh, they do tree notes so well.

**Omen** \[An opening of cold apples and wild-foraged porcini leads to a heart of consecrated incense, wool sweaters, soft amber, damp ash, hellhound musk, and English moss\] - Green apples, dirt, green moss, animalic mushroom musk (I *hate* this, it's like b.o.), and a mere touch of incense. It's admirably atmospheric but not at all my jam. I disliked this so intensely I had to wash it off as soon as I finished writing this review.

**Otherworld** \[An enchanted blend of gossamer iris, our hand-extracted Violet Intrigue lavender, Madagascan vanilla absolute, pure vanilla co2, Hidcote pink lavender, shimmering amber, fairy wings, and a cloud of iridescence\] - It's really *so* lovely, a mix of pink iris, cotton candy sweetness (in its airy-fairy sense, not sticky-sugary), and an undertone of Arcana's beautiful shimmery silk note. It's soft and fairly skin-hugging but has really excellent longevity. This one is going to be a beloved spring scent for me.

**Spectre** \[The fuzzy aroma of a cozy ghost. Velvety skin musks are layered over sweet Tonka bean, sheer cedarwood, silk satin, vegan rabbit fur accord, powdery sandalwood, and a drop of citron\] - Yuzu-tinged, sweetened fur. I'm relieved that the strong plasticky undertone that I smelled in my greedy goblin sniff straight out of the mail was gone by the time I first-tested it. But this scent is still underwhelming considering how much I love so many of the listed notes. I was hoping this would be much like **Moth-Like Stars** but with the delicious warm sandalwood of **Hati**, all shimmery silk and cozy sandalwood, but it's really mostly iso-E and a mapley undertone. It actually reminds me a *Iot* of Death and Floral's **That first morning moment** \[Cozy blend of lavender and chamomile tea, with notes of white amber and soft cotton\], with which it shares *no* listed notes. I had fully expected to adore this one - there's nothing wrong with it, if you like yuzu-chamomile-snuggly fur you'll probably love it - but it's not at all what I'd hoped, so I guess this GWP sample saved my wallet from its later FS release.

**Witches Go Hiking With Fairies** \[Wild-grown pineapple plants with tiny hummingbirds flitting all around them, densely treed coniferous forests, fairy bee honey, Tahitian vanilla, soft, damp mosses, and a hint of woodland strawberries\] - A thick humid scent of pineapple, honey (I would almost say honey cake - there's a faint cakey yeastiness - pineapple upside-down cake!), and I get jungle vines more than I do evergreen trees. It's very cool, but none of those are notes I particularly enjoy, so admired the artistry and destashed my sample.

# Arcana Wildcraft EDP

**On the Wing** \[Creamy white amber, velvety cashmere, shimmering silk voile, salty Orcanox, and diaphanous musk. A sheer, airy, yet strong and concentrated skin scent. Perfumer's Note: On the Wing is our fancy flanker of Moth-Like Stars. We used the same formula but replaced some of MLS's raw materials with more luxurious versions.\] - Oh look, it's **Moth-Like Stars**! It might be even a little more sheer and fuzzy than the original, but it's *awfully* close, and I also can't tell how much of the difference I'm getting is simply because of the change in format. Happily, I can say that I don't get a strong, unpleasant alcohol note like I often do from EDPs (I steer away from EDPs and go only for oils, as a general rule). But I also am not sure this is different enough from **Moth-Like Stars** to warrant buying both, even if you adore their cashmere and silk notes like I do. That being said, Arcana has announced that they do plan to phase out **Moth-Like Stars** in favor of the (more expensive) **On the Wing**. Originally their plan was to start offering **On the Wing** in oil format as well to replace the oil **Moth-Like Stars**, but just a few days ago they said that actually they can't - these components dissolve significantly better in perfumer's alcohol - so they *won't* make an oil version of **On the Wing** but they *will* offer smaller-size EDP versions of it. (Which is nice: currently they just have the $75 one, which is a lot when you're used to indie perfume FSes usually being around $20-30.) I'm not sure if this means they won't eliminate the oil-based **Moth-Like Stars** after all, but it's a possibility, so if you're primarily an oil person, like me, you might want to pick up **Moth-Like Stars** when Arcana reopens after this current hiatus, just in case. I do very much enjoy **On the Wing**, though - so pretty! - and like I said, this is an unusual and wonderful one where I don't actually mind the EDP format.",1,1732802323.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

1h1wgw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundNBC/comments/1h1wgw5/theories_on_who_is_helping_sir/,Theories on who is helping Sir,"It's not Ethan.  I keep seeing that people think his reaction to finding out Dhan captured Sir was strange and it was weird that he seemed more upset about being last to know.  I think season 1 aired so long ago that many have forgotten that Ethan knew something was up but not what it was. Dhan had come home acting differently after finding out that Sir escaped the basement. Ethan also saw Dhan getting his gun and preparing after Gabi asked him to go find Sir . Ethan was worried because Dhan was acting like he was going to war and like he was about to do something that would destroy him. Ethan knew the only way Dhan would do something like that was if  Gabi had asked him to do it. He asked Dhan what Gabi had asked him to do and Dhan didn't tell him . Ethan later went to M and A and asked Gabi where Dhan had gone and she wouldn't say. So this is why Ethan got upset about being told last and became hostile toward Gabi after Dhan missed work because of a case. I get why he was upset with Gabi, Gabi worries about the lives and trauma of everyone on the team but Dhan.  She doesn't see or acknowledge how much he sacrifices to help her .

I don't think it's Christian either but feel like he has his own skeletons that I hope get uncovered this season. I don't buy his innocent act or his over the top reaction to finding out their mom was murdered.  Also, the fact that he's a grief counselor makes me worried that he's going to get closer to Gabi and she's going to start confiding in him because she had unexplored grief about her dad .

I have doubts about the receptionist being the accomplice.  I feel like she doesn't physically seem the type to be Sir's helper and like she would have told him about his brother coming to town. If she is the accomplice , she's not Lena . I would assume she and Christian would have recognized each other . 

Right now I think the accomplice is someone we haven't met before but has built  a connection to M and A that allows them to get  intel while going unnoticed. I think they were outside when Gabi and Lacey were heading into the office after getting coffee and overheard Gabi upset and asking Trent how he could let Zeke's equipment confiscated because it was his connection to the outside world. Being told about that conversation is why I think Sir suddenly decided to try to scare the agoraphobia out of Zeke . Zeke only comes up again one other time in the episode.  It was after Gabi kicked Trent out and they were talking in front of the receptionist.  But during that conversation,  the case also came up and how important it was that they found the mom before cps took the daughter.  If the receptionist was the accomplice,  she would have told Sir and his attention would have been on helping Gabi with her case.

Lastly, I don't know about Lena . I think she could be being used as a redherring and the person helping Hugh is someone related to him through his dad since no one knows anything about Hugh's dad.",2,1732802148.0,FoundNBC,0,1.0,False

Healthy discussion and authenticty is encouraged! 

When the soul selects its human avatar to incarnate as, in order to balance karma and teach the soul's main desired lessons, each soul chooses the negative traits, deficiencies, challenges to overcome, and illnesses of the human avatar. Karma is basically a law of energy. Whatever energy one gives, they will receive that energy back at some point. Karma's purpose isn't to punish or get revenge, nor is its purpose to reward or teach. Karma is a fundamental law because it keeps reality balanced with the Source's vision and makes it possible for the Source to experience itself as millions of different individuals existing in all possible times. It also allows individual souls and fragments of the Source that have, willingly or unwillingly, forgotten who they are to create whatever they want, even if it is not of high vibration. This is important because although we all stem from love and light, darkness and despair are also forms of energy that make up the womb of the Source. Without negative concepts, there would be no positive concepts; they are opposite sides of an energetic coin.
This is important insight for those possessed with a depressive or angry inner world. When we have cultivated a low vibrational mindset and worldview, it can feel impossible to snap ourselves out of it. Even when more positive beings attempt to change our minds, a simple ""cheer up and be grateful for what you have"" is meaningless and more emotionally isolating for the being dealing with the reality of the negative mindset. This is because the being on a lower vibration is vibrating the human consciousness at a lower frequency, and thus they attract lower feelings and emotions, as well as more depressed or hateful thoughts. To get out of this frequency by will is a spiritual skill that, once cultivated, can bring you back the control and power over reality that God meant every human to have.
While living as a human in this day and age, it is extremely hard to avoid causing harm to yourself and others, but it all lies in the individual experience. For example, let's say there is a farm in Central America that supplies coffee beans to the USA but has really poor working conditions and is run by a drug lord. If you never watched the news and just lived your life, went to the gas station, bought a bag of coffee beans, and went back home, the fact that you never realized this and had no negative intentions would mean it didn't affect your karma. If you had known about this from the news prior, even if you heard about it without much thought, then the act of buying the beans would be judged by the all-knowing version of you.
This is why so many souls are stuck in the cycle of Samsara. Before they come here, some souls, in order to negate karmic debt or to make up for potential karmic debt, may choose certain experiences, illnesses, or allergies to intensify when karma needs to be repaid or are cursed temporarily. This includes things like what viruses they will be more sensitive to, what allergies and socializing qualities they will have. This is not just for karmic debt but also for balance in general. The more positive things and fewer humbling experiences a soul has when dreaming in a human ego, the more susceptible they are to committing evil acts and gathering a lot of negative karma. Examples of this happening are corrupt politicians or, to the extreme, power-hungry dictators. These are souls that had a lot of karmic benefits before they came here, as they had the possibility to choose to be born in a high-potential human avatar, in a good time. But the karmic consequences their souls now face are not those of God's wrath or something; it is the state of consciousness they exist in after coming to the realization of their acts after death. The power to spiritually transmute and switch frequencies is not only a magical way to live a human life but a quality any soul would benefit from learning.
For example, if one were to kill a fly, instead of the karmic debt being something the Source chooses at the time of the fly's death, it would be set to always repay such an act in the form of a three-hour headache. Mental disorders like depression, anxiety, and narcissism are life cycles that explore a soul's lessons intensely and fully. Repeating patterns are a sign of a main soul lesson, and thus mental disorders are meant to be adapted, transmuted, and overcome by the soul who associates with them. The goal of life is many things, but the main goal is to become more in tune with divinity and ascend spiritually. Every part of reality is a projection of you, and any soul has the potential to awaken those templates and causal bodies that influence physical reality.
We are beings of light who chose to come here. We are all-knowing eternal beings. We incarnate here for many different reasons, but the choice is ours. We plan out our life to best suit the lessons we want to learn. We choose our avatar (human body), our parents, our enemies, our partners, and our names and date of birth. The zodiac signs make up the template for our perception of reality. Before we incarnate and while the human body is still developing, we are shown all the different possible experiences we can have. This is why we get déjà vu.
In order to learn these lessons, veils are cast upon us at birth, a significant one being the Veil of Forgetfulness. This prevents us from remembering who we really are. Its purpose is manifold, designed to elevate our consciousness through natural growth, as experience is the best teacher. Here's how it helps our soul evolve:
Learning and Growth: It gives us a clean slate in each life, allowing us to learn and grow without past life biases, making each experience fresh and impactful.
Karmic Lessons: By obscuring past memories, we face life's challenges anew, tackling unresolved karma that aids in our soul's evolution, learning needed lessons from multiple perspectives.
Free Will: With no recollection of past existences, our choices are grounded in the present, fostering genuine free will and decisions that reflect our current spiritual and personal development.
Spiritual Development: This forgetfulness compels us to seek deeper, reconnect with our spiritual roots through self-discovery, and cultivate a greater understanding of our higher selves.
To transcend the Veil of Forgetfulness, one typically engages in spiritual practices aimed at expanding consciousness and self-awareness. This often includes meditation, ritual work, study of esoteric texts, and self-reflection, all intended to reconnect with one's higher self and deeper spiritual truths. The goal is to remember one's divine origins and true purpose beyond the physical realm. Religions, specifically the monotheistic Western religions, have dogmas that will tell you remembering your past lives or having access to the knowledge of the soul is demonic and illusion, but this is just to keep you under their control. The concept of the Veil of Forgetfulness and higher veils are practiced in secret by all three of these religions, and lifting them is essential to rising up their hierarchy.
God makes no mistakes; there are no coincidences. If you have broken the Veil of Forgetfulness, you have earned that and will face new lessons hidden behind even higher veils to be broken in order to raise your consciousness further. To transcend the Veil of Forgetfulness, one typically engages in spiritual practices aimed at expanding consciousness and self-awareness. This often includes meditation, ritual work, study of esoteric texts, and self-reflection, all intended to reconnect with one's higher self and deeper spiritual truths. The goal is to remember one's divine origins and true purpose beyond the physical realm.
After transcending the Veil of Forgetfulness, other metaphorical veils can include:
Veil of Illusion: This refers to overcoming the misperceptions and distortions of reality created by one's own beliefs and societal conditioning.
Veil of Separation: This veil creates the illusion of separateness from others and the divine. Overcoming it involves realizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the unity of existence. This is where the saying ""we are all one"" comes from. You won't understand its true meaning unless this veil is lifted; only then does it become blatantly obvious to you.
Veil of Suffering: This involves understanding and transcending the roots of personal and collective suffering, recognizing that much of it comes from attachment and aversion within the cycle of desire.
Each veil represents deeper layers of spiritual realization and challenges one to integrate these understandings into their daily life, furthering their spiritual evolution. In Buddhism, this state is referred to as Nirvana.
Elaborating further, it’s crucial to understand that the soul's journey through incarnations is a profound process of learning and evolving. Each life is an opportunity to balance karma, gain wisdom, and deepen our connection with the divine. By choosing our circumstances and challenges, we set the stage for the lessons we need to advance spiritually. This conscious planning reflects our innate desire to grow and expand our consciousness. Recognizing the interplay of karma, spiritual laws, and our chosen life path helps us navigate our experiences with greater awareness and intentionality. It empowers us to break free from negative patterns and elevate our vibration, ultimately aligning us more closely with our true divine nature.

1h1weag,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1h1weag/my_26m_gf_25f_was_approached_by_a_colleague_in/,My (26M) gf (25F) was approached by a colleague in common.,"Hi everyone,  
Last May, I started dating my current girlfriend, who is also a colleague. Due to my PhD program, I had to leave the country in July, but our connection was strong enough that we decided to continue in a long-distance relationship (LDR). She is objectively quite attractive and has been pursued all her life, which I can accept. However, one of our colleagues, who was a half-acquaintance, half-friend, began showing interest in her. While she showed no interest and only replied to his messages occasionally, he kept trying to prolong conversations.

In June, this colleague went to the US for a two-month internship but continued trying to talk to her. Due to her ghosting and long response times, he eventually gave up. Around this time, I also left the country, and everything seemed fine. Although we didn’t hide our relationship, we didn’t make it public at work, as it was a personal matter, but about 80% of our colleagues knew.

When I was abroad, this colleague asked my girlfriend out on a date (apparently unaware of our relationship). She politely declined but, trying not to hurt his feelings, said she wouldn’t have minded having a coffee with him under different circumstances. I was upset with her for leaving the door even slightly open, even if she didn’t mean it that way, as I saw it as disrespectful and potentially problematic. She understood my point, but since the message had already been sent, we moved on quickly.

After that, the colleague became cold toward her. Given her social anxiety and empathy, she later asked him in private about his feelings. He told her he was depressed about the situation but wouldn’t interfere in our relationship. This upset me because her approach made it seem like he still had a chance, and I felt it opened unnecessary doors for him. She defended herself, saying she had done nothing wrong and that I was upset because she was being kind. We argued for four days because I couldn’t accept that her kindness, while well-meaning, could lead to bigger problems. She maintained that she was just trying to help a colleague heal.

Four days later, the colleague asked for another one-on-one meeting, which she accepted without telling me. Afterward, she explained that he had expressed his feelings again, saying he was sad he hadn’t acted sooner, that he was a 27-year-old virgin, and that this was his first time approaching a girl due to fear. She reassured him that she loved me, it wasn’t a competition, she would always choose me, and she wasn’t attracted to him. She hoped they could remain friends. At the time, I chose to focus on her happiness rather than boundaries, given that she is sensitive and has experienced abusive relationships in the past.

Still, I felt increasingly angry at him and eventually messaged him, explaining that his actions were disrespectful and would lead to serious consequences if he persisted. He apologized, admitting his selfishness, but added that he wasn’t afraid of my threats. This heated me up further, and I wrote a harsh reply exposing him for being immature and claiming he would remain a virgin for another 27 years if he didn’t change. I didn’t send it, following my girlfriend’s advice, though she said she wouldn’t have minded if I had.

Despite trying to move on, I started resenting him so much that I felt like assaulting him. One day, my girlfriend told me he had invited us to an event and made comments about wanting to hug me. This reignited my frustration. I told her I felt disrespected by her continuing to engage with him as if nothing had happened. She argued that he had been polite and wasn’t pushy, so there was no lack of respect.

We had a two-day argument, during which I expressed that I couldn’t tolerate further situations like this and emphasized the need for boundaries. She eventually said she might try to be firmer in the future, but I was left feeling like I was controlling her interactions.

Was I right on stressing the topic or am I being controllable with her actions and should I work on myself rather than on the event?

TL;DR, I started dating my girlfriend in May, and despite moving to another country for a PhD, we decided to continue our relationship long-distance. A colleague of ours expressed interest in her, despite knowing about us later, and persisted even after being politely rejected. My girlfriend tried to handle the situation kindly, which I felt left the door open and disrespected our relationship. I expressed my concerns and messaged him to assert boundaries, but my anger escalated. Despite resolving the situation, I struggle with resentment toward him and feel conflicted about whether my expectations were reasonable or controlling.",1,1732801918.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

We’ve known each other for a while, we met at work but no longer are at the same job site and recently reconnected to where we are now dating. I met her about 5 months ago and started reconnecting this past month with having to go on a date and seeing each other two other times for some coffee. We made out a couple times on our first date and the following hangout. On the following hangout after the date (our third time hanging out) She wanted to know what we were doing and I said we are seeing each other and she was confused by that answer but after making out and going on a date I told her I like her and we could be in a relationship and just don’t know what she would think about that, well she liked the idea and wanted to be in a relationship so we are now bf/gf. I have never dated anyone this much older than me. She has a successful business while I’m in the middle of my career. I’m not taken back about the financial side of it, it’s just that she works a lot and the communication can be off some days which I understand. I would just like advice on how to properly handle a relationship with my older business-driven gf, how can I try to add value or be there for her?

Happy Thanksgiving!

I work from home as a content creator and blogger. While I love what I do, it’s mostly a solitary job that can get monotonous and lonely at times. That’s why I’m reaching out here to see if there’s anyone else in a similar boat who would **be interested in chatting off and on during the workday and building a long-lasting friendship**. Ideally, I’m hoping to find a *future best friend*—someone to share everything with —from the mundane day-to-day stuff to life’s big moments. I know that kind of connection can be rare, and even more rare to find it on a Reddit sub, but I thought I’d give it a shot anyway.

***I am in a relationship, so I’m ONLY LOOKING FOR A FRIEND.*** Over the years, I’ve drifted apart from my friends. They’ve all moved away or started families and are too busy to talk anymore. I really miss having someone to talk to and connect with on a deeper level besides just my boyfriend.

I live in Florida, and I think it would work best if *anyone interested in getting to know each other were in a time zone that is not too far away* and had *time to talk during the day* because I am hardly ever online at night. Since I work online most of the day, I like to unplug and step away from my electronic devices during my off hours at night.

# A little bit about me:

* I’m easygoing and introverted (though I’m much chattier online).
* I’m an animal lover with two cats (but dogs are great, too!).
* My hobbies are mostly solo activities: 
   * Drinking copious amounts of **coffee and reading** (fiction is my go-to — everything from Shakespeare to contemporary romance novels. One of my degrees was in English Lit., so I have a wide variety of reading interests.)
   * Listening to **music** (hard rock/metal, alternative, classical, and some dance)
   * Watching **TV shows and movies** (sci-fi, fantasy, some horror primarily)
   * **traveling** when I can find the time
   * And, occasionally **playing PC games** (MMOs and Civilization are my favs— though sadly, I haven’t had the time to play much in the past few years. I am really looking forward to Civ 7 coming out, though!)

# What I’m looking for: 

* Someone who’s also seeking a long-term, genuine friendship (gender doesn’t matter).
* Someone in the **USA or available during the day on EST** time. 
* A few **similar interests are preferred**, so we have a good starting point for discussions. However, I enjoy learning about new people and perspectives, so don’t worry if we’re not twins interests/personality-wise.
* Lastly, since this sub can attract scammers, I’d prefer you **reach out from your main account (not a throwaway)**, so I know you’re a real person.

If you think we might hit it off, **send me a message**! To make our conversation meaningful, please start by introducing yourself and sharing a little about yourself — one-line messages like “Hi” or “How are you?” won’t cut it. I’m all about putting effort into the conversation and would appreciate the same in return.

I’m looking forward to getting to know you and hopefully building a lasting connection. Hope to hear from you soon! 😊",0,1732801027.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

1h1vyiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h1vyiu/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend/,AITAH for breaking up with my girlfriend?,"
I had liked this girl (A) for a while, she had kind of a tragic past, and she had mentioned it to me a few times, about a guy from a different religion that she loved, he never gave her a commitment over the two years she spent with him and she ended up hurt. This girl was the exact opposite of the type that I like. Me being a little conservative, I liked reserved girls, who dressed in ethnics, had long hair, and talked to limited people. This girl was the exact opposite, short hair, bold dressing, talked to literally everyone (and had had multiple relationships in the pastand talked unapologetically about it) but because I knew about her past and how loyal she was to the last guy, and she held a Secret Intelligence kind of position at the institute but did her work with integrity and dedication, I got attracted to her. I wanted to see her happy after what she’d been through. People mentioned to me “She’s too broken for you.” but I didn’t care.

Since I had just broken up with my longterm girlfriend (3 years), I decided to take a halt and understand (A) before asking her out. We were both pursuing our Graduation and were batchmates. I decided to talk to her roommate (B) first and take updates from her to have an unbiased judgement and know if (A) is someone I can date. After two months of talking to (B) (just as a friend), she confessed having feelings for me. I denied (B) and told her that I just saw her as a friend and we continued being friends, although I reduced my frequency of talking or hanging out with her. And one time she mentioned wanting to go on a trip and I took her on it along with my roommate to avoid any misunderstanding. 

I’d never mentioned to (A) about liking her and she was naturally unaware about it. I planned on asking her out towards the end of the academic year, but had to prepone my plans after finding out that she went on a trip with my friend (AA) over a long weekend. As soon as they were back, I saw them hanging out a couple of times before I shared it with my mother, asking her advice on what to do. My mom suggested that I ask her out before things go south and I lose a chance, my roommate thought the same. So, I checked with (AA) just to confirm that I wasn’t interfering in case they had a thing going on already. He assured me that it was safe to ask her out and that they didn’t have anything going on. 

So, I asked her out the next day saying that I’d tell her the reason once she went with me. She agreed and I took her on a date in a really old school way, booked a cab, got her flowers and chocolates and asked her to dress nicely. She showed up in a long flowy Maroon dress. We got seated and she asked me the reason of the outing, I told her the above mentioned reason and her face went pale, she didn’t see it coming. She swallowed and said.. “What about (B)?” and I told her that I had already mentioned to (B) that I only saw her a friend. She replied, “1. I never thought of you that way. 2. I can’t do this to (B). While I understand that you’ve kept your boundaries clear, and she’s aware that it’s gonna hurt when she falls, doesn’t mean she won’t feel hurt when she does.” The rest of the evening went in discussing other things, and I told her that I understood that she didn’t want to hurt her friend, but also mentioned that in case some day they stop being friends, she should think of giving me a chance. She laughed it off and left. Later at night, she mentioned to me that she was about to tell (B) about the evening’s highlights. I didn’t mind. I was determined to impress this girl, so I drew her a sketch, of her! Next day I took out (B) for coffee and told her the truth, that it was for (A) that I was talking to her, and that I’ll always consider her a friend, and (A) believed that she’d be hurt if she gave me a chance. After a while, (B) understood and agreed to convince (A) for me and she actually did. I was on cloud nine. I’d go through her umpteen instagram posts every night before sleeping, she was pretty. 

I was doing everything right, but then that night (A) called me and started crying as she said.. “You’re putting in too many efforts, please don’t do this. I don’t have the appetite for what you’re bringing to the table. I can’t give you back anything.” I was shocked that she saw this as a transaction. I just wanted to see her happy, she continued “You remind me of the old me, the one I was for him. And you doing all this makes me feel like now I’m him, just on the receiving end. It took me a long time to get out of that arrangement and I had to portray him to be wrong for me, to get out of it. And here I’m doing just what he did. If I do this, I’m going to be wrong as well, and if you somehow convince me that it’s not wrong, he was never wrong either. That puts me in an existential crisis. Please don’t do this.” Watching her so vulnerable, I decided to step back and asked her to stop crying. She did and kept the phone. 10 minutes later, (B) called me and started screaming at me for making her cry. I didn’t intend to make her cry so I screamed back at (B) to not interfere into something she didn’t know about. 

Next day, I took (A) out again and told her that I’d step back and it was because I wanted to see her happy, if she was happy that way, be it that way. She agreed and left. Coincidentally, the same night, my ex texted me and asked me to reconcile. I mentioned this to (A) and she was okay with it. I reconciled with my ex - R., A week later, grade reports arrived and (B) had to repeat the year, she left for home and visited the campus occasionally. I didn’t see (A) for the next one month, until she got into a huge problem. She reached out to me and asked if I could help, which involved police and visiting a different state altogether, but because she wasn’t actually causing the problem, rather in it, I agreed and went along with her. A little contect about R, she’s the best girlfriend one could ask for, exactly my type, only problem- trust issues, as soon as I hung out with some girl, she’d blame me for sleeping with her, naturally I decided to avoid telling her about it. (A) and I left the same night, got the thing sorted by the next evening, she didn’t eat till the problem was sorted, when we finally sat down to eat in the evening, R called and I told her about the day, she immediately started blaming and cursing me and I lost my shit, I dumped her, again. (A) kept apologizing, I told her it wasn’t her fault and we headed back. I got her a toy turtle on the way to cheer her up later on, she mentioned that she felt a spark with me. I kept my hand under her head in the bus and pulled her close, she pulled back, and sat down and said “I’m not ready for it, you aren’t either. You just broke up.”, She had a point. I stopped.

After the incident, me and (A) started hanging out more frequently than before and I cleared with her that she didn’t do it because of the guilt from my breakup, she denied. I asked her out again, and we went on another date. On our way back, I asked if I could peck her on the cheek, she didn’t say anything but looked hesitant with her eyes wide open. I understood it was a NO. She stopped hanging out with me again and I got mad at her for this. I was hurt, I demanded an answer and she flipped. She said, “this is the reason I don’t feel like hanging out with you, I feel you’re too possessive and you behave like my boyfriend. You aren’t, I don’t want a boyfriend.” She became less and least visible over the next week, I joined her circle of friends to be around her and she started to disappear from there. A week later everyone left for home, due to festivities, she couldn’t, knowing that she wasn’t going, I stayed back as well. The hostel mess was closed and we had to go out to eat, so we went out like thrice a day, and she mentioned wanting to get drunk. We booked a place and she wanted a pool in it, that was over budget for us, so we got a place with a bathtub instead. We started drinking and debating, like intellectual debates. It was fun, until my head started spinning and I didn’t want to do something wrong being drunk, so I went and threw up to cut down the dizziness. She patted my back as I threw up, I came back and closed my eyes, we kept talking and I mentioned that my dad was mad at me for not going home, and unknowingly revealed that I stayed back for her. 

Two minutes later, she said.. “I want to get intimate with you.” I looked at her, she was looking at me already, she leaned in and we kissed, the most passionate kiss I’d ever had. I was scared, but we ended up hooking up, it was the steamiest s*x of my life. We talked about it the next day and she said, “I like you, but I don’t like the kinda hurt you get from relationships, I don’t like to be controlled, I’ll do everything because I wanna do it, if we get into a relationship, it’ll happen because that’s how an ideal relationship is supposed to be. I don’t like to do things because someone set a standard to it and we’re supposed to follow it.” I liked her, I agreed. I’m the conservative kind, who only sleeps with the woman he’s dating and dates to marry, this was new. We did it a few times over the week and I couldn’t pretend more, I told her that I needed commitment and she thought for a while, told me a few things like, “The tattoo on my left rib, is the name of my ex, I had a misscarriage with him, and I got it inked to honour what I lost.” would you be able to live up with that? I felt bad for everything she’d been through. I wanted her to be happy, I accepted it, she agreed too but with the following condition- We don’t tell anyone about us until February (Placement season) due to two main reasons (it was November):
She held a Secret Intelligence kind of position at the institute, and people might mistake her for passing down the intelligence to me due to our relationship (She never did)
(B) was home and had not watched us grow closer, it’d be a shock to her and a cruel thing to do to her while she was dealing with her own life’s miseries. 

She also mentioned being in talks with my friend (AA), some time before the festivities began and people left for home, but it didn’t work. He wanted something serious but never put in the effort for it, she didn’t find him serious enough, and had already decided to not go ahead with him when he left for home, knowing she was staying back. I asked if they had ever been physical and she denied. I believed. We kept it hidden from almost everyone other than my roommate, and a little later I told another mutual friend. Things were going fine and then I noticed pictures of her Ex on her instagram, the same guy who hurt her, why she’d still keep it when we were dating, although she posted the pics two years ago, but now that we were together, they were supposed to be deleted. I asked her to let go of the pictures and she denied saying, “that was a part of my life, You are not replacing that, you are a different person, and you’ll make your own space.” I was hurt, she’d not leave her past behind for me. Then came new year, she tried planning the eve with me initially but later on it was just her friends group each evening they’d sit down and discuss a new place until she stopped participating, I’d be present during each discussion but no one ever invited me. I wasn’t even invited until I caught her booking tickets, she covered it immediately, by saying, “You can only book 6 tickets at once, you want to join? I’ll book yours in the next batch?” I was furious, we were dating and she wanted to celebrate the new year away from me, was I not worth the acknowledgement? When I questioned her about it in private, she said, “I assumed, you’d want to be around your friends, so I  asked them if they wanted to join, they seemed disinterested and I can not force everyone to celebrate with me. We’ve just begun dating like a month ago, I can’t alter your plans for mine, you’ve been present in the discussions everyday, I wasn’t the one planning anything, how could I just invite people for a party I wasn’t planning, and btw, I’m not invited either, I volunteered to join it. You never told me of wanting to celebrate with me, how would I have known?” How would she have not known? It just meant I wasn’t important enough for her. We however, sorted it out. 

A couple of days later, I bumped into (AA), my friend who wasn’t talking much to me lately, I assumed it was because he had a chance with (A) but now that he saw her hanging out with me, he might be upset about it. I approached him and asked him about it. What he said shattered my world. He told me that (A) had always told him about everything that we discussed and that both of them were in an unsaid relationship, not only had they been physical but had also hooked up a couple of times, once when they went on the trip after which I asked (A) out, and once just before he left for home. I was upset because I’d checked with him before asking her out and he didn’t mention it to me then. He replied that (A) didn’t want it to be public knowledge and had asked him to keep things to himself. He showed me chats of them flirting. I revealed to him that I was dating her, his face went pale and he paused and denied talking more on it.  I was upset the entire day, unable to share it with (A) but unable to hold it within. 

She sensed something was wrong and asked me time and again about it. But I didn’t know what to do. Frustrated, I asked her to make our involvement public knowledge, immediately. She kept asking me the reason behind it, I denied to tell her the reason and keep away from me, till she was ready to let the world know that we were together. She called it senseless and illogical to just randomly tell people that we’d been together for a month now, when we had already discussed about it and that we’d let people know in Feb. I was hurt, I went back to (A) and read their chats again, it was some hardcore flirting. I was shattered. She asked me again before going to bed of why was I behaving the way I was behaving, I tried holding it, and did for a long time but couldn’t. At 5.30 in the morning, I called her twice to talk, she didn’t receive the call, I wanted my answers and (B) had come around, so I called her to wake (A) and ask her to call me back. She did. I ordered (A) to meet me at the hostel gate at 6, she pulled a show about me waking her up on a chilly winter morning and that she’d asked me at night and I didn’t tell her then, and if I could hold it for 4 hours, I could have held it for another 3 and talked to her about it at 8, when she woke up. But I was done, I wanted answers, I accepted her with everything but not lies. I asked her about what I got to know from (AA), she kept looking at me confused for a while and then denied his claims again, although she was crying this time. She accepted having flirted with him but mentioned that it was before us. 
She kept denying ever being physical with him, at the end she asked me two questions: 1. Why did he not tell it to you if we did it on the trip, when you asked him before asking me out. 2. If we went a second time with it, there must be a place that we went to, where’s that place? Then she went on to say, does he have proof of things he’s mentioning have happened, I’d not have proof for something I don’t agree with happening in the first place. I was irritated, I demanded a conference be done about it. She denied, saying, “You’ve done enough when you went to him with your query, twice, it’s his word against mine now, a conference would only prove to him of how much you trust the woman you claim to love, I don’t want to put myself in a situation like that. If you don’t trust me, you don’t and there’s nothing I can do about it, if there was enough trust, you’d have come to me the moment he spoke all this shit to you, not gone back to him to collect proof. I kept asking you the entire day, you kept sulking. You created your own suffering when you decided to hold on to it and not share it with me. And then you decide to talk at 6 in the morning and this bullshit. I can’t prove to you things that never happened, if you still want proof, go ask him the questions I asked you. I’m not being a part of this conference. Also, in case you still feel the need to vet things I said, feel free to end this relationship, something that doesn’t stand on trust doesn’t work out.” she left after the monologue. I told her, that I don’t believe in confidence and that I’ll vet whatever she said and if she leaves me, that shall be enough evidence that she never loved me. 

I asked (AA) the two questions, he denied hooking up with her, but stuck to the statement that they made out multiple times. Him changing a huge statement, made me question things and I went back to (A), apologized to her and asked her to get back, she was upset, but eventually agreed. After the new year celebration, we made us being together public knowledge.

Another month has passed and I still didn’t feel important in the relationship, and her tattoo kept haunting me, one night I asked her to remove it and she said, she’d mentioned it to me before we started dating and that she didn’t like these changes, and that maybe someday in future, when she was over it, but not now. But aren’t you supposed to change for the people you love? It was a long argument that night, she started crying, but I was hurt too. A while later, she apologized for getting the tattoo in the first place (could have been sarcastic) but I was hurt and I screamed at her for not respecting my feelings, it was late and she asked me if I wanted her to burn it off, so it could be removed immediately to end this argument. She avoided me the next day, but I wanted to talk and I got her to meet me. She said crying “I don’t want to after last night, but because you won’t stop, I’ll meet you and I won’t be responsible for the way this ends.” We met, and she didn’t agree even till the end to get the tattoo removed, she cried and told me that I shouldn’t have dated her if this was going to be an issue. And it wouldn’t have been, but now I felt uncomfortable. I had to apologize again, I didn’t want to lose her. 

A month later, she went to visit an old friend of hers, who she mentioned as -once had a crush on her 6-7 years ago, and they realised it won’t be a good match and nothing ever happened between them, and they remained friends, I was okay with her visiting him, but then I found out through her that they shared the room and in fact the bed. I started finding it hard to trust her, so when she came back I was passive aggressive with her and told her that I'm not okay with her sharing a room or a bed with another guy. She got a little uneasy and said that I needed to calm down, and that she was aware and clear with her boundaries. She was supposed to leave for a different city to attend a wedding that evening but I demanded that she stayed back, as she had just returned and I couldn't trust her much after the incident that she shared the bed with another guy and that she didn't update me frequently when she was out, she brought up how I had broken up with R because she demanded it and this escalated to a terrible fight and she called me out for having trust issues, the same issue that I had with R. And after this fight, she told me to end things with her and then left for the wedding anyway. 
I understood my importance in her life. She didn't care that I felt hurt, she prioritized the wedding over us. I was disappointed and thought to myself if she doesn't care, maybe the answer lies in front of me and went back to (AA) one last time. This time I found a call recording of both of them where she kept telling him that he didn't put efforts and that's why she couldn't be with him. This was after we had hooked up. I still didn’t find any evidence of them hooking up or making out after going through the chats again and again but the hardcore flirting and ",0,1732800550.0,AITAH,3,0.5,False

While waiting, I decided to grab a coffee from Costa. At the billing counter, I noticed a woman who kept glancing at me and even smiled. I thought it was just a polite gesture from brief eye contact, so I smiled back.

After paying, she moved to a nearby table, and I noticed she continued looking my way. Feeling curious, I walked closer to her table and asked if she was waiting for someone. She immediately responded with, “Why don’t you sit here?” Surprised by her directness, I joined her.

As we talked, she accidentally spilled her iced latte, soaking her pajamas. She placed her phone on the table and casually asked for my number, mentioning that she was new in the city and would love to connect. We chatted about our interests and how we usually spend weekends. Later that night, she texted me and suggested meeting up.

I went to pick her up, and when I saw her, she looked stunning—way more dressed up than I expected for a casual coffee or shisha outing. I felt a little underdressed in comparison. As I drove to a nearby spot, she commented that it was crowded and asked me to take her somewhere quieter.

While we drove, she began sharing her story, saying she is looking for a husband. At first, I thought this was just a casual date, but she quickly got to the point, asking me outright about my intentions. She mentioned that her time was valuable, and soon enough, I realized she wasn’t there for a casual hangout. She hinted at a hookup and even brought up a price.

This was completely unexpected, and I decided it was best to respectfully drop her back. On the way, she tried to convince me, talking about her implants and how good she was at what she did. I couldn’t help but laugh internally at how wild the situation had turned. I dropped her off and called it a night. It’s often misunderstood that men are only interested in hookups, but sometimes we simply want a genuine connection with a woman who’s open to hanging out casually and getting to know each other.",0,1732800497.0,dating,8,0.44,False

1h1vtig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1h1vtig/dive_into_the_beautiful_madness_of_music/,"""🎹 Dive Into the Beautiful Madness of Music Production Chaos! 🚀""","Title: The Beautiful Chaos of Music Production 🎶

Hey friends! Let's talk about something that keeps us all up late at night, tangled in a web of cables, lost in a sea of plugins, all while clutching a cup of cold coffee—music production. 🌟 Whether you’ve just downloaded your first DAW or you’ve got racks of analog gear, we can all agree on one thing: music production is equal parts exciting, frustrating, magical, and utterly chaotic.

Here’s why I *love* it:

---

### 1. **The Process is Messy (and That’s Okay)**  
Let’s face it, it’s not always a straight line from idea to fully-polished track, right? You lay down a sick beat, but then your synths sound muddy. You tweak one EQ setting and suddenly your incredible mix implodes. 🙃 But isn't that part of the charm? Creativity doesn’t thrive on perfection—it feeds off experimenting, failing, and arriving somewhere unexpected. Let your sessions *breathe*. Revisit that track you gave up on last month. You might be surprised.

---

### 2. **Your DAW is Just a Canvas, Not the Art**  
We’ve all been guilty of this: staring at Ableton, FL Studio, Logic, or whatever you use like it’s about to magically write the song for you. But remember—it’s not about which DAW you use. It’s about what you *do* with it. A laptop and some half-decent headphones are more than enough to create something amazing today. Some of the most iconic songs in history were made on gear that would make modern producers cringe. It’s not the tools; it’s how you use them.

---

### 3. **Tiny Adjustments, Big Rewards**  
Ever adjusted a reverb by like… 1% and suddenly your track just *clicks*? Those thrills are the *best*. Music production really teaches you patience and attention to detail. Every small tweak—a slight delay, a little high-pass filter, chopping that vocal just right—pieces a puzzle together in ways that feel like magic. Obsess over the little stuff while keeping your bigger picture in mind. Balance is everything. 😊

---

### 4. **It’s Not a Competition (Except With Yourself)**  
If you’ve ever browsed a music gear forum, watched a production YouTube video, or scrolled Instagram accounts showing off insane studio setups, you know the feeling: “Am I even good enough?” News flash: YES, YOU ARE. 👏 And no, you don’t need a room full of synths or the weirdest plugin of the week to prove your worth. The only person you’re competing against is yourself. Get better than you were yesterday, that’s it. Your sound and vibe are valid as *hell*. Trust that.

---

### 5. **Collaboration is King**  
You know what’s cooler than working solo? Finding people to vibe with. Two (or three, or four) heads are always better than one when it comes to cooking up creative gold. Share your stems. Remix each other’s tracks. Hop into vocal booths, even if they’re just closets full of blankets. Collaboration will push you further; others will hear things you might have overlooked and challenge you in ways you couldn’t anticipate.

---

### Also, a Little PSA: Don’t Neglect Your Ears 👂🎛️  
Please, for the love of music, protect your ears, y’all. Every extra decibel you blast in your headphones or studio monitor stems from excitement (we’ve all been there), but take breaks. Hearing fatigue is real. Trust me—your ears are your greatest asset. Appreciate them. Break often. Hydrate. Then get back to making noise.

---

### So What’re You Working on?  
I want to hear all about it! Got a sidechain bassline you’re tweaking? A vocal hook stuck in your head? A track in *that one* genre you can’t even describe? Drop it in the comments. Let’s celebrate the messy, beautiful process of creation together. 

Ready to embrace the chaos?  
Let’s talk. Let’s learn. Let’s grow. At the end of the day, it’s all about making that one listener—ahem, yourself—TRULY FEEL SOMETHING. 🎧💫

My nMother had never had a good relationship with my eDad although he was generally loved by all and considered to be quite kind. nMother, on the other hand, is disliked by almost everyone she is very close to. She has strong narcisstic tendencies but has never diagnosed with NPD.

Once eDad fell ill, I stepped in to fulfill a lot of her needs and desires as well as work with her. It meant going out with her for coffee, helping out with shopping, travelling back to hometown for work and touching almost every aspect of her life. I indulged her too much - I was too young and alone to know any better.

Once I got my footing in the new city, I made a few friends and found a partner. She liked the partner at first but she was always very unhappy when I spent too long with them or slept over. Eventually, the bitterneess from nMother affected my relationship with them and we broke up - I hate that I wasn't strong enough to protect us both. After some time, I found another partner who was great and eMother loved them too because we did almost everything together. However, once we started separating out a bit, shit hit the fan. She became aggressive, insulting and honestly quite crazy. To the point of comparing my ex with my current partner to their mother (remember South Asian). I understood very clearly then that I had to be strong for my partner.

Whenever I did something that nMother didn't want, she would lecture me for hours on end. I wasn't able to answer back well to that raging storm. Once I started answering back, it all became so much worse with a new high of craziness and occassional attempts to hit me. Her favourite card to play was the sacrifices she had made while raising me. She would invent emergencies to get me back home - eDad's health, work or just say that she was feeling bad. If I didn't come home, she would be upset and there would be a whole ass conversation after I got back. There were clearly visible controlling tendencies - accompanied with upset if she was unsuccessful.

Being involved with the family business meant that my money and time was under nMother's scrutiny. Whenever she was upset, she would bring up something business related and make it all about that. When I tried my very best for the business with dedication and commitment, this still didn't change. It was difficult to get out of those situations because she was technically my boss.

To summarise - emotional incest, enmeshment, power dynamic, entitlement and control

nMother herself is a woman of many skills and deep knowledge. However, she has never ever pursued or stuck to a hobby with dedication in front of my eyes. She has always been dependent on people and busy in power play. She doesn't even work all that much anymore - the business mostly runs on autopilot.

Before my eDad passed away, I had started my journey of separating from them. I had stepped away from the family business to start a career of my own. I had, for all practical purposes, moved in with my partner with whom I had adopted a dog.

The change was already fraught with discontentment and anger from nMother. Now, the entire situation seems unmanageable as she cannot handle being alone for even a night. I have started spending more time at home though Golden Child is here. Once he leaves, it will be very hard from her side to go back to my previous life.

In addition, I have certain responsibilities to fulfill in the family business which means that I must put my career plans on the backburner (though that can be managed somewhat). nMother has already expressed her distrust towards me but continues to sweet talk me at all almost all times, letting herself show only when she is even slightly upset.

At this time, going back to my old life seems hard enough. Once I decide to move out, it will be hellish.

I don't know how to do these things without her getting so enraged that she creates a scene which I am unable to excuse myself from. She has another card of being completely alone and will use it with Golden Child (and other family) to apply pressure on me.

Deep down, I wish to leave the family business and just stick it out on my own to avoid the enmeshment. But leaving itself and then moving out will also create so much drama - especially this soon after eDad's passing.

My partner recommended that I keep focusing on my career while handling a few key responsibilities for a few months. If I am unable to create a good enough power dynamic with nMother, I will then move in with my partner and their mother. I know it's not possible to achieve a better power dynamic but I'll try it if I can't find a better solution.

Sorry for rambling. I hope I made some sense to someone. At the core of it, I am tired of having to fight for everything that I want to do. Now, nMother has so many cards to pull that she can make it near impossible to do anything peacefully.",1,1732800073.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False

There's not much to describe; it's black, has a small opening to drink out of which you can simply press down to shut it, and it holds 500ml. Even though the lid is pretty secure, it doesn't have a screw top, so I don't dare to just throw it into my backpack, but I never had an accident while putting it into the drink holder at the side of my backpack. It looks a bit battered now because I've been using it almost every day for at least two years, but it's been holding up better and longer than I originally thought. I heat it up with hot water before I fill it with coffee in the morning, and it keeps the beverage pleasantly warm until the evening (at least it did the one time I didn't drink my coffee in the afternoon). It's one of my favourite items, not only because I depend on my daily coffee and it enables me to satisfy my addiction at any time and everywhere I go, but also because I got it for free. I got it as part of one of those product testing thingies - you buy something, leave a review on amazon, and get your money back. I initially took part in this because I like getting stuff for free (who doesn't), but I ended up getting one of my most used everyday items. It's been providing me with cheap and delicious coffee for a long time now, and I hope it will also accompany me for even longer in the future.",1,1732799763.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False
1h1vpgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/homedesign/comments/1h1vpgp/my_design_ideas_for_studio_apartments/,My design ideas for studio apartments,"Hello, so recently, I have been working on brushing up my home design skills and I thought I’d share my design ideas on a random studio apartment I saw online. So, let’s get into it. This apartment has plain white walls and natural wooden floors. To make it very warm yet looking quite chic, let’s get a special something like a large canvas wall art. A piece with tones on a more neutral note in a vibrant key, like a minimalist painting, something like this image from ihomeart. It will harmonize with the clean design and look best in the room. It’s unnecessary to overdo it. One large piece of artwork on a small modern sofa or over a dining table will suffice. Furniture should be as small as possible, but all of the essentials should be included. I am talking about a loveseat to save space on the floor. Softness may be introduced with either a round coffee table or a wooden glass top. Caring for living elements is easier than caring for artefacts, thus, introducing one or two plants, such as a fiddle leaf fig. There are many ways to choose functional but beautiful light: a popular brass lampshade will help. Some of the other beautiful concepts that need to be incorporated include using area rugs to demarcate the zones. Storage is the key to every studio out there.

All straps and ways of wearing seem to be comfortable to me. The only issue I have is dry eyes because of my contacts.

I started with Light Seal, using the AVP as intended. I switched to using the AVP without Light Seal for a while for productive work, to test it out. Due to the limited desktop space without Widescreen available at that time, I felt I did not really have any productivity gains. I started using the AVP more as media consumption device so I put the light seal back on and stopped using it productively.

Since the release of Widescreen I have been using the device purely for productive work last weeks. I went for the ""open"" view again and it's perfect for long sessions. Especially because I am wearing soft contact lenses the open view is perfect for long sessions. There is an obvious glare when the AVP boots up and the screens are black, after boot I barely notice any glare at all.

It's not just Widescreen that helped. I did not see the ""Input device"" error AT ALL anymore since Widescreen (this was very annoying for being productive). Also my AirPods just stay connected unlike before and audio passthrough is perfect. Connection stability has increased, I can make a coffee downstairs while wearing the AVP and everything stays perfectly connected.

What is your preferred way of use? Open / closed? Do you use your AVP for 4+ hour work sessions? Do you notice other improvements related to productive work and Widescreen?",1,1732799601.0,VisionPro,2,1.0,False

Gently rocked by Satoshi's footsteps, sounds of crunching leaves the only thing breaching the hallowed silence of nature, Léandre almost fell asleep as they made their way back towards his village, the only home he had known, its peaceful cobblestone streets and small country church soon to be a memory... As concrete came into view, Léandre saw the blurry silhouette of an early riser on his morning jog. Realizing his... let's call it ""compromising"" position, he jerked awake, burying himself under the cover. Satoshi looked at him.

""- A problem ?

\- I know everyone heeeere... ! Said the teenager, his croaky whisper of a voice filled to the brim of the most agonizing cringe, mortified to the last degree.

\- I wouldn't worry about it.

\- HOW ??

\- Lesson numero the first. Through usage of The Veil, we escape the Commons' notice.

\- The what now ?

\- The Veil, real and unreal made one. It's a fundamental of the Gift. Something any Gifted can do with sufficient teaching. There are a few of those and that's the first I'll impart onto you. For all intents and purposes, we're currently invisible.

\- Huh. That's handy."" Léandre conceded, settling back down.

The young man guided the older through the streets, towards his home. They passed a couple of people on the way and indeed no one seemed to mind nor notice them. After climbing up a hill and going through a little square, deserted if not for the habitual drunk sleeping off an unfortunate life under a bench, they reached Léandre's place. It was a little house, in the middle of a street. For anyone living in a big city, this would seem like a picture of paradise but, housing prices being what they are in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, this was overall a very affordable little lodging, in which he had lived for as long as he could remember with both his parents, for while, now with his mother and step-father. Satoshi set him back on his feet in front of the door, letting him lean against the wall.

""- I am going to make it so you're invisible to them for a couple more minutes. Hurry it to your room, hide your clothes, get some real sleep. I will be back tonight. Make what goodbyes you need and pack your bags. Take both warm and light clothes, we're gonna cover quite a bit of distance. Don't take anything you do not need, you're gonna have to carry it all. Don't forget your phone charger and grab a toothbrush. I'll get a tent and a sleeping bag for you.""

Satoshi didn't give Léandre any opportunity to pipe up during that soliloquy. He didn't need it either, it wasn't the first time the he'd gone hiking... That was exactly the kind of spiel his dad would give him when they would go camping in the mountain to spend a night under the stars between father and son on the weekend. It was a little nostalgic. Slightly overwhelmed, he could but nod and make his way home.

He opened the door as little as he could, with great care not to make a sound, looking around to be sure neither of his parents were in sight. It was all clear. At least his mom didn't get insomnia tonight. He slipped in. His home was fairly ""open concept"", the door giving directly into a large living room with his bedroom being upstairs and the kitchen behind an American bar. He was too young to remember it, but his mom had told him all about how much remodeling she did when she bought the joint. It didn't look like a rural home at all anymore, to his regret.

Climbing up the stairs, gingerly, strategically choosing where to put his feet down to minimize creaking, he saw his mother exit her bedroom in her little pajamas, half bent forward, shuffling forward, eyes closed with a grumpy expression on her face. He'd always found that look she had before coffee a little adorable. He hurried upstairs, slithered into his room, took off his wrecked clothes, shoved them in a plastic bag, shoved that bag in an old school bag and dove under the blanket. He never thought he'd feel such overwhelming delight in his own bed. The warm, comfy, homey feeling was filling him up to the brim with glee, recharging his energy... Until he fell asleep a second later. The boy was understandably very, very tired.

His slumber was tumultuous. He dreamt of struggle. It all played again in his mind. The running, the jumping, the landing. More running, climbing, jumping and fighting, and fighting, and fighting. Evil eyes and shark teeth, hellish maws promising deaths. The sound of rending flesh, the taste of blood, the cracking of bones. Getting dragged on a bed of sticks and stones, dragged through hell to be reborn in fire, forged anew, filled with an electric desire for more.

And Satoshi's face, still and cold.

His eyes opened all at once. Deafened by his sudden waking up, it took him a bit to properly hear his mother's voice calling to him. He didn't move, didn't answer, trying to collect his thoughts. For an instant, he wasn't sure where he was. Mentally, a bit of a crapshoot, but physically ? He felt *good*. Like *good* good. No more pain, no more aches, he could see perfectly, perhaps better than he ever did ? He could feel his body more clearly than ever before. He could tell what was going on, like he could hear the symphonic capharnaüm of blood pumping through his veins, the stretching and relaxing of his joints, the electrical impulses coursing along his nerves... It was a little overwhelming, but he had never felt quite so much like himself.

His mother opened the door his room without knocking, pulling him from his introspection. He hastily pulled the cover over his own nude body. 

*For the reader's comfort, the following dialogues will be helpfully and seamlessly translated from French to English.*

*""- Mom, I told you to knock before you enter !*

*- Oh, please. I've seen you naked every day for months, it's a little late now to decide to be prudish.*

*- I was a baby !*

*- And to me, you still are. Good morning, Léandre.*

*- Good morning, mom...""*

Léandre's mother, Myriam Ludvikowsky, wife Duchamp, was a sturdy looking woman, stocky and wide, with curly black hair her son had inherited. Even on the weekend, she took care of herself. She wore very little makeup always had fancy, well coordinated clothes with assorted jewelry, betraying her past as a rather successful flutist. She had given up touring when he was born, but she still recorded here and there, offered interviews and private tutoring, that sort of things. Her only unwavering demand when negotiating any job was for her to stay near her own home.

She made her way inside his room, pulling the curtains open. The sun was high in the sky, blinding the boy. She chastised him, arguing that a weekend was no sufficient reason to oversleep as she foraged around for discarded pieces of dirty clothing only to find an old sock caught under a chair leg. He sheepishly agreed. He knew his mom. Trying to argue with her was basically pointless. The woman was a force of nature, which had its pros and cons... Furthermore, he couldn't really explain the events of the night to justify his oversleeping, now, could he.

After she had kissed him good morning and left the room, he dressed himself and went downstairs. Lunch was served and his step-father was nowhere to be seen. Léandre enquired and learned that he had decided yesterday evening to spend the weekend at his parents'. They had some catching up to do and all that. She seemed to not be very jazzed about it. Were they having a falling out ? Léandre had not really paid attention to the recent homely goings on, too caught up in his own feelings, his own teenage angst. But knowing he would soon leave this place, perhaps for good, he felt guilt. Everyone always drones on and on about how one should cherish one's loved ones for we never know what might happen. As a 17 year old boy, thoughts of death had always seemed so far away from him. But after last night, that distance closed significantly. And thinking of leaving... That's also a form of death.

Besides that, the lunch was spent mostly in silence, news on the TV filling up the space between he and his mom. He didn't really know what to say anyway. When had they grown so distant... ? After they were done and cleaned up the table, as Léandre was going outside, his mother asked him to at least be there tonight. They were going to have a guest home and the visit would be about him. Léandre frowned, puzzled. Satoshi ? But how could he have contacted her, especially in a way that would not cause to spiral out, especially on such short notice ?

He walked around town for a bit. The fresh air, now warmer, settled his nerves a little. This all felt like a last farewell. Letting his feet carry him where they wished, he did a grand tour of every place he had spent considerable time in. The square he played in as a child. The one bookstore in town, and the entire afternoons he spent there reading whatever he could find without ever buying anything. The bakery next to his father's old grocery store and their adorable owners that let him bake baguettes that spelled out his name that one time. Quite a few memories around here. Not all of them happy.

His school. Elementary, middle and high school all in one. A deep rural France special. Traditional education had never really fit him. He had always felt out of the loop, a defective gear in a well oiled up machine. Maybe that was the root of his malaise. That's where he became aware of it, at least.

He stayed there for a bit, across the street, looking at the entrance. He was trying to feel something, anything as he thought about how he'd never cross that threshold again, but nope. Not a single thing. No joy, no sorrow. Nothing. A nothingness so complete, so overpowering, he could feel himself collapse from the inside. Imploding. The feeling he had always tried to run away from. The feeling that brought him to that hospital. That now brought him here, with this strange power coursing through him.

On the same sidewalk, out of his vision and below his notice were a group of high school boys, about his age. Some a little older, some a little younger. About six in total. They were familiar to him. A bunch of assholes that, while rarely at the forefront of it, were always happy to carry on the bullying initiated by others. It had never been anything particularly grave or dangerous. Just enough teasing, mocking, rough-housing and threatening for Léandre to have never truly felt safe anywhere within their reach. They seemed very glad to find him here.

*""- Heeey, Léo !* Belted out the ringleader with a very hollow bonhomie.

*- Oh, Hi Paul ! How are you doing ?* Léandre answered joyfully after finally becoming aware of them. He had never been that warm to them, much like they had never really been nice to him, but today was a special day, wasn't it ? He hoped they'd just fuck off faster if he kept it civil. They seemed a little taken aback.

*- Doing fine, thank you. You look good. Been fucking your mom lately ?""* Paul answered with a sneer, trying to restore the ""natural order"" of their relationship.

While that was, overall, a very basic insult to be throwing around, it rang differently here. A couple of years ago, Léandre's life had been ruined by a rumor that he was, indeed, fucking his mom. In a small backwater such as this one, rumors spread like wildfire and can very easily encompass one's entire social life. It had gotten so bad that Léandre was spending all his free time hiding under his blanket, classmates congregating near his house to sing made-up songs about ""Léandre the mom fucker"" under his window, parodying popular songs or current cartoon openings. At first, his mother, chiefly implicated, took it in stride and advised him to do the same. ""They're gonna grow tired of it"", she said, ""let them exhaust themselves"", she said.

But they didn't exhaust themselves. The rumor steadily gained in following, growing like a tumor, sordid little details piling up on top of each other to create multiple conflicting tales of the event. The worst part ? No-one seemed to really think it was that big a deal. Not the kids, not the teachers. Just a little bit of youthful fun, it wasn't anything serious. Kids being kids. No one was getting hurt, after all. But the phenomenon grew and grew so much, engulfed his every waking moment so fully that Myriam was spurred to action. She marched into the office of the school's director and drummed up an absolute scandal, threatening to take it to the cops, putting the school itself on the grill on grounds of harassment and defamation. Her hay days might have been long past, of her own accord, but she still had a name to defend, she argued. The motherly onslaught was such that even the pachydermic inertia of the French education system yielded before her. She managed to get in contact with the main instigators' parents, and soon with their kids themselves.

Her intervention managed to quell the tide of filth, but the rumor had never really been forgotten and it eared its ugly head whenever someone wanted to get a rise out of him. It was a very effective tactic. Not so much because of what it had done to *him*, but much more because of what it had done to *her*. As laid back as she had been throughout most of this, he had been the only one to see how it affected her towards the end. He had seen her silently cry on the couch when she thought he was in bed. Her social campaign had exhausted her mentally, so shortly after his dad left. But she had compartmentalized that, pushed down the sorrow of the separation to take up arms in his defense. He made *her* suffer because *he* was such an easy target. Because *he* hadn't been enough of a man, in his own mind, to take the matter in his own hands and do something about it, the load on his mother's shoulder had become that much heavier.

But no more. He was going to leave. He would never have to see their faces or hear that horrendous refrain ever again, God willing. But it wasn't enough. Running wasn't enough. Not anymore. Awakening to the Gift lit a fire under his heart, a yearning for action. A drunkenness borne of sudden power. 

His face illuminated by a cold glare, he walked up to his bully, grabbed him by the collar of his overpriced polo shirt and drove his knee into his crotch, unloading years upon years of frustration and self-flagellation into him.

It would have been a devastating blow at the best of time and Léandre *did* remember to hold back somewhat at the last moment, images of the last dog's skull mangled under his fist flashing back to him before impact. But this was still much harder of a hit than should be expected from a thin-limbed teenager like him.

As he watched his habitual tormentor fall to his knees, face warped in pain, his eyes welling with tears, hands protectively clutching his jewels, Léandre felt... weird. This should have felt good. Why didn't it feel good ? This was his just revenge, his long awaited retribution ! God knows the fucker deserved this and much more ! This was but a fraction of the pain he and his cohorts had inflicted upon his family, upon his mom ! And yet he felt... regret ? Guilt ? Shame ? Why ? It was so unfair ! He stood there, looking down at him in silence as his panicked buddies started chittering some ""Wow ! Are you okay ? I'll call your mom ! I'll call the hospital ! I'll call the police ! What is wrong with you ? Holy shit !"", buzzing around like panicked bees after the capture of their queen. One of them struck back in revenge. Léandre took the punch, square to the cheek. It wasn't a strong punch, but it would have been enough to knock him to his feet a few hours ago. But now ? Today ? He just took it. He barely flinched. He looked at the face of his aggressor from above the fist. The look of pure confusion. He thought of striking back. He remembered the mangled skull.

*""Sorry.""*

1h1vjfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle/comments/1h1vjfw/_/,:),"I’m smiling, but I don’t think I should be.

In fact, I think something very, very bad has happened.

It began with Nikita, Alan, and a harebrained endeavour. They were trying to pull me out of my “funk”; a quirky, palatable way of referring to clinical depression. Not that I have to worry about such things anymore.

The day has almost entirely pushed out the night.

Nikita and Alan, with conniving looks on their little faces, were chortling at me from the sofa. I tried to ignore them, instead finding purchase on the armrests of my chair; busying my fingers by kneading the fabric like dough. Stimming, folk call it. Certainly used to help me when I felt anxious.

That only temporarily kept my grinning friends at bay. Eventually, with a deep sigh, I looked up. Alan was hypnotically wiggling a little, white pill before my eyes; rubbing it between his thumb and index — enticingly, which was strange, as the tablet appeared no less ordinary than an aspirin. Than any white pill. Yet, it enchanted me. *Saw* me, though such a thing made no sense.

I groaned. “I’ve told you so many times, Alan. I’m not going to try ecstasy.”

He chuckled. “You’re so innocent, Macy. It’s not ecstasy. It’s emptanol.”

“Emptanol? That sounds made-up,” I said, though my gaze did not waver from the pill.

Alan shook his head and thrust the tablet into my palm. “It’s not.”

“Okay, what does it do?” I asked sceptically.

My friend smiled. “It gets rid of pain.”

And I replied, “I hate to tell you this, Alan, but your wonder pill has already been invented. I’ve got two boxes of paracetamol in the kitchen drawer, actually.”

“Not *physically*,” he said. “It ends mental pain. And you only need to take the *one* pill. Just one will change your life. Change your neurological makeup.”

“Well, that’s just science fiction,” I scoffed, twiddling the pill between my own fingers. “Even the best antidepressants in the world need to be taken every day. There is no ‘one-and-done’ fix.”

Alan shook his head, then nodded at the emptanol. “It’s here, Macy. The answer. No more depression, and none of the numbness that comes with Sertraline; this will make you happy.”

I sighed. “Look, I don’t know what black market drug you’ve actually bought, Alan, but I’m not taking it.”

He produced a second pill. “That’s why I’m going to take one first to put your mind at ease.”

“You’ve not even *tried* it?” I asked, hoisting my brows higher.

Alan rolled his eyes. “Of course not. I told you, Macy: *one pill*. That’s all it takes to irreversibly alter your brain chemistry. I wanted to wait. Wanted to take the journey with you.”

“Just to let you know, I’m going to sit it out,” said the ever-reserved Nikita.

I frowned. “What? Why?”

“Because Keets isn’t depressed,” Alan replied, squeezing his girlfriend’s shoulders.

“Besides, I’m going to make us some food in a second,” Nikita added. “*Proper* food. Not the takeaways you’ve been eating all week, Macy.”

“I eat proper food…” I protested, folding my arms. “I just know what I like.”

“Well, today, I’m going to cook something that none of us have ever had before,” Nikita promised, before smiling. “But it’s a surprise. It’ll be a fun way to get out of your comfort zone.”

“We’re *all* getting out of our comfort zones tonight,” Alan whispered.

Then, without any warning, he gobbled down the emptanol.

“There,” my friend said, sticking out his tongue to show that he had, in fact, ingested the drug. “We’ll wait for it to work its magic, then you’ll take yours. Okay, Macy?”

“Do you even know what you’ve just taken?” I asked, once I’d picked up my jaw. “Is it *safe*?”

“Bit late to ask that now,” Alan said, checking his watch. “Anyway, I’m supposed to notice results within the first few minutes, but my brain will rewire fully over the course of the next twenty-four hours. The seller said it would feel like day pushing out the night.”

“Right. And how does one pill fundamentally change your mind?” I asked.

He groaned. “You remember Liam from school, don’t you? LSD broke his brain. This is just the other end of the spectrum; emptanol will *fix* our brains. I mean I…”

Alan trailed off and sat silently for a few moments. Then he tilted his head to eye the coffee table with great intrigue, sparking grins from Nikita and me.

“Has it hit, sweetie?” she asked her boyfriend.

Alan hummed curiously; coldly, like a machine processing code. “What are we having for dinner, Keets?”

She smirked. “That’s all you have to say? I was expecting some enlightened, philosophical statement. Maybe the drug needs a few more minutes to work its—”

“Have you ever thought about it?” he interrupted near-breathlessly, stuck on some new train of thought.

I grinned and asked, “Thought about what?”

“What it would be like?” Alan moaned, almost orgasmically, as he ran his fingers through Nikita’s hair.

“Careful! You’re going to mess it up,” she warned.

“See, I never thought about it before,” he continued, ignoring his girlfriend and bunching up a clump of her hair in his hand. “Nikita made an interesting point about leaving our comfort zones. Trying things we’ve never tried before. It’s given me an idea. An unorthodox one. And nothing matters now, Macy. Let me show you.”

Suddenly, like a dunking bird from an office desk, Nikita’s upper body was thrust into the glass table below and hoisted straight back up; only, rather than heat, it was Alan’s hand that fuelled the engine of his toy — his firm grip on her hair. The deranged man had slammed his girlfriend’s face into the coffee table, filling it with broken shards. Blood and wailing gushed from Nikita’s lips, but not a sound gushed from mine. I simply sank into the armchair.

Alan continued. He repeatedly dunked his plaything into the wooden frame — all that remained of the table — and lifted her into an upright post. Dunked, lifted, barely paused, then started again.

“*STOP!*” I screamed as the life flitted from Nikita’s rolling eyes; eyes stained with blood running from the glass protrusions in her skin.

Alan did stop, but only half a minute later; once he’d bludgeoned the girl he loved into a lifeless mess. The calm man rose to his feet, then rolled Nikita’s twitching body to the side with a large toe, dismissing her gurgling, *fading* pleas for help.

“I was demonstrating something,” he whispered. “Look at me, Macy. I’m fine. No pain. No sorrow. I feel light; content, unlike you on that medication. This is what Nikita and I wanted for you. Not to feel nothing, but to feel *happy*.”

And that was what made me scream. Alan, having done what he’d just done, wore a beaming smile on his face. I know I was afraid, though I’ve forgotten how that felt. I’m beginning to forget how anything dark felt, as dawn has nearly broken into day.

“*GET AWAY FROM ME!*” I remember screaming.

My face was coated in a film of tears and snot as Alan approached. I tried to escape, but he quickly hurled me back into the armchair and shushed me as I shrieked for salvation. My dear friend answered that cry for help by wrestling the emptanol out of my clenched palm and prying my lips apart.

“Come on, Macy. It's time to wear your happy face. You'll never feel terror like this again,” Alan cooed, thrusting the pill into the back of my throat, then shutting my lips as I gagged. “No, Macy. Swallow.”

I mumbled a sound of refusal, and Alan gently smiled. He was so joyous, and I understand why now. He was free.

“Swallow, or you’ll want to call the police. And then I’ll have to snap your neck,” he softly said, stroking my hair with his free hand.

It wasn’t a threat. Just a promise. Not a hint of venomous spittle projected from Alan’s soft lips. He simply wanted me to feel the same way as him, and I swallowed, of course, as I didn’t want to meet the same fate as Nikita.

Then came more than serotonin. More than the simplicity of chemistry. It was an awakening. A giddiness. It wasn’t like the antidepressants. It was just that everything was bright and colourful. Beautiful.

It is only now, close to twenty-four hours later, that I find myself asking questions. I know the emptanol has almost finished its work — remodelling my mind. But I feel an urge to post this. To reach out to all of you.

Did Alan do something wrong?

He says I shouldn’t even have questions anymore. Questions are doubts, doubts are worries, and worries should be purged by emptanol.

“The chemicals must be taking a little longer to *fully* mend you, Macy,” he explained at the kitchen table. “Perfectly natural. Admittedly, I was a little uncertain when I killed Nikita. But then I remembered *why* I’d decided to do it, and I felt tremendously excited. Bludgeoning her was no different than mashing potatoes for a Sunday roast.”

I nodded and smiled, then tucked into the meal.

“Long pig,” Alan said, placing the dish in front of me. “I’m positively thrilled to be trying it with you, Macy.”

He was right. Human meat is easier to appreciate, from a culinary standpoint, once you rid yourself of morality and, in my case, neurosis. I’ve never tasted a dish so succulent. Nikita was medium-rare; perfectly cooked.

Nevertheless, the drug hadn’t quite drowned all of my pain — still hasn’t, but it was worse last night. That’s why I’m posting this. Part of me, strange as it seems, remains fearful of emptanol, though I haven’t the foggiest clue as to why. After all, it’s cured my depression.

Nikita was a *little* fiddly to eat, as I still felt residual sadness, anger, and fear. As you might imagine, that spoiled the meal ever so slightly. It didn’t sour my mood, as emptanol had already washed such a capacity away, but it certainly kept me from maximal happiness. For some reason, there lingered a horrified part of me, far from my conscious mind. I had to incessantly dab away the tears from my eyes, so as not to over-salt the meat.

And I found Nikita thoroughly delectable, but it was difficult to swallow each mouthful, as my vocal cords insisted on [screaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).",4,1732799152.0,dominiceagle,0,1.0,False
1h1vinu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h1vinu/i_30m_cant_get_used_to_living_with_my_girlfriend/,I (30M) can't get used to living with my girlfriend (27F),"Hello guys and gals,

I'm a 30 year old dude, in a temporary long-distance relationship(she's gonna move in with me in a couple of years) with my girlfriend, 27 F. I've had only a couple of girlfriends over the years and I am very very used to living alone. This summer in June i met my actual girlfriend, who lives 2 hours away. She comes to visit very often, around 2-3 weeks, I also drive there for weekends every now and then, so the contact is  pretty regular.

But I have quite a few issues that are not necessary about her, but about me and my own problems. Since I am used to living alone and not explaining to anyone why I do this and why I do that, I need some advice in getting used to living with your significant other. I also work from home, barely going to the office every now and then. Sometimes I feel like sitting on my computer, watching youtube, relaxing, playing video games a little(not pushing it to the limits tho), reading a book, redditing, etc. But whenever my girlfriend comes home with me for like 4-5 days, up to a week, I feel like I am out of my comfort zone for good. She wants to cuddle most part of the day, sit in bed and watch a show together, eat popcorn while doing so, but most of the times I want to get back and do my own stuff, if that makes sense. She is anti-gaming or sitting on the computer for other than working, but that is exactly my type of relaxing activity which if need to calm my nerves after a long working day.

Do not get me wrong, I do enjoy spending time with her cuddling and watching shows, cooking, but sometimes I do need my private space. When I explained to her that sitting on the computer and playing or haging out with the dudes on discord I my way to relax and de-stress, she insists on the fact of sitting just by ourselves because our time together is limited. And I agree with this, but even tho' she is here or not, I just need that small period of time for myself, not sure if it makes any sense. She has friends in my city, but rarely ever hangs out with them for a coffee or something, she prefers sitting with me and doing our usual stuff together, which at some times is not relaxing for me anymore. I know for a fact that she enjoys spending time with me and doing stuff together, and I am not against her hanging out or doing her own stuff while she comes to spend time with me, but sometimes I feel like it's too much because I can't do any of my usual stuff anymore: reading, haging out on discord with the guys. Must I mention that she expects my whole attention whenever I am not working: she gets mad if she sees me sometimes scrolling on facebook, chatting on whatsapp with my buddies, because ""our time is limited and you choose to pay attention somewhere else"", and after that she gets mad and grumpy, coming up hours of explaining and she being mad at me for such small stuff that I normally do(not exagerating them) when she is not around. Once, we visited a couple of friends and when we got home, we had a HUGE argument, stating that during that visit I did not gave her enough attention.

I do love spending time with her and doing stuff together, but sometimes I feel like my old self does not exist anymore, but the new me that is not doing anything beside spending time with her. Basically my old habits and relaxing methods do not exist when she is around, and that stuff is stressing me out somehow. She barely does anything on her own, like sitting in bed and watching TV or chatting with her buddies or tiktoking or whatever, all she wants is to sit right next to me and talk, watch stuff etc.

Sorry for the long story, but I want to know how to get used to this new lifestyle and, and what is your opinion? Do I have a problem with spending too much time on the computer or? Because I feel like sometimes that I am losing myself and not doing the stuff I enjoy the most because I need to be spending time with her. I love her very much and she loves me, but I do not know how to get used to getting out of my comfort zone for those new habits and live with them.

Journaling is one of the most [powerful gratitude](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/why-gratitude-is-the-key-to-success/) hacks. Take a few minutes each day to write down three things you’re thankful for. These can be big or small—the smell of coffee in the morning, a supportive friend, or even a sunny day. Research from the University of California found that people who kept weekly gratitude journals felt more optimistic and happier than those who didn’t. Keep your journal on your bedside table to make this habit simple and consistent.

# 2. Create a Gratitude Jar

Take a note from kindergarten crafts and make a gratitude jar. Write down something you’re grateful for on a small piece of paper, fold it up, and toss it in the jar daily. Over time, it builds a physical reminder of all the positives in your life. On tough days, go through the jar to give yourself an instant boost. It’s a fun project to do with family or friends and reinforces the practice in a creative way.

# 3. Say ""Thank You"" – And Mean It

https://preview.redd.it/jmuhoxo04n3e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=295c3f8ff759aa77746b2f617c25cae728f65d55

Saying [**""thank you""**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/say-thank-you-a-fundamental-principle-of-civility/) might sound basic, but doing it genuinely and often is a game-changer. A 2014 study published in *Emotion* found that expressing gratitude can strengthen relationships, whether it’s thanking your partner for washing the dishes or appreciating a colleague for their help. Pay attention to when you feel genuinely thankful and take the time to verbalize it. This small action can create meaningful connections.

# 4. Practice Gratitude in the Morning

Start your day with a gratitude ritual to set a positive tone. Before getting out of bed, think about one thing you’re thankful for. Whether it’s the opportunity for a fresh start or something simple like cozy sheets, this practice will help frame the rest of your day. According to happiness expert Shawn Achor, focusing on positive thoughts in the morning helps prime your brain for success and a better mood.

# 5. Use a Gratitude Reminder

We get busy, and gratitude might slip through the cracks—so set yourself up for success with reminders. Whether you add a daily alarm on your phone labeled ""Gratitude Time"" or post sticky notes with positive prompts around your home, these little nudges can help you pause and reflect. Apps like Grateful or Thnx4 are also great tools to streamline this habit.

# 6. Reframe Negative Thoughts

https://preview.redd.it/637kmmf24n3e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb30735c6ab1781d59cd166c130712350bfdc6b

Turning challenges into opportunities for gratitude is a powerful hack. For example, instead of being frustrated by a long workday, focus on how it helps you provide for yourself or your family. According to the Greater Good Science Center, reframing negative situations to find a silver lining rewires your brain to notice positives, even [**during tough times**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/how-to-reboot-during-trying-times/). It’s not about ignoring struggles but finding balance in your perspective.

# 7. Celebrate Small Wins

Gratitude doesn’t have to be about monumental moments. Often, the small wins get overlooked in our busy lives—but those little joys add up. Celebrate things like completing a small task, enjoying a really good cup of tea, or hitting all green lights on the way home. These moments, when recognized, can bring more joy to your day than you realize.

# Gratitude Can Change Your Life

Gratitude is a skill, and just like any other, it takes practice. These seven hacks offer simple, actionable ways to bring thankfulness into your daily routine, helping you cultivate a more positive and fulfilling life. Start with one or two hacks, and build from there—soon, gratitude will become second nature.

Why wait? Start today by jotting down three things you’re grateful for, and see how it shifts your perspective!

1h1vdi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h1vdi5/aitah_for_wanting_to_leave_the_room_while_my/,AITAH for wanting to leave the room while my fiancé is having an acid reflux attack.,"So my fiancé suffers from extreme acid problems currently. He’s being seen by a few doctors currently to get it taken care of. These attacks wake him up in pain in the middle of the night, at about 3-4am. And it’s lasts for 1-2 hours. And during this he makes audible heaving noises during every breath, for the entire hour. 

Now, in general he is a dramatic man. And he acknowledges this. But do you really need to heave for the ENTIRE 2 HOURS? He’s said that is that painful. I’d understand during the peak of it, but non-stop for two hours in the middle of the night? 

I work a job where I don’t get home until about 2-3am and I’m very tired. Once I wake up from sleep, I’m one of those people that are just up and can’t fall back asleep. And on days I get minimal hours of sleep, anything less that 6, I suffer from a very bad migraine later in the day.

What causes a bad acid attack at night is choice in diet during the day. Like coffee, greasy foods, triggers in general. Or alcohol if he decides to have a drink. Maybe the minor drug use too, not sure on this one though.

He’s 20 years older than me, and I feel like I’m already suffering enough of the consequences of his poor choices for the past twenty years with him. I take him to the doctor, stay for 2-3 hours at a time, make the calls, change my diet In solidarity. But that’s love I guess.

I’m tired of losing sleep and having to hear him make audible loud heaving sounds and disturbing my sleep. I don’t know how bad the pain is that he needs to heave loudly with every. Single. Breath. And maybe it is that bad, but I do t think I need to be subject to sit through it. He feels I do. I’ve asked him to just step out of the room or have told him I’m stepping out and he was baffled by my decision. If he’s going to make poor choices in his diet that day, I feel like I should have to suffer sleep loss from his acid attack. I believe that’s his own doing at that point until he changes his diet.

I went to the dermatologist and showed her my results as well. She said she's not a fan of such restrictive diets and she would rather recommend a low-histamine diet and stress management (funny joke). I'm very conflicted because even though some parts of the diet overlap (no gluten, no emulsifiers, no alcohol, lots of raw vegetables), some don't at all (dairy, sugar, some specific fruits and veggies, coffee?).

I felt quite good when I left the house, threw on some leggings and a long sleeve t shirt I couldn't fit in earlier in the year and my new coat which is 3 sizes smaller than last years.
Happy days.
Then in the light of day I just feel ancient and saggy and huge.

I just worry that I'm still going to hate myself at my goal weight.

Sorry for all the negativity, over all I'm so grateful for this medication and my progress so far.

1h1v1pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlowLiving/comments/1h1v1pj/simple_living_in_a_coliving_space/,Simple living in a co-living space,"In the past year, I had the realization that the pursuit of stuff and impressing others has made me miserable. I had a high-paying (but high-stress) job as a financial analyst and basically had a breakdown from working so much. My nerves were frayed and despite my high pay check, I felt like I had to keep up with my peers and have my lifestyle match what was expected of me. I quit and took a job that pays half of what I was making but is far less mentally taxing and no longer feel like I’m stuck in the rat race. I sold and donated most of my meaningless shit and took inventory of the stuff that matters and realized very quickly I had no real friends after I made this move.



Most people in my life weren’t supportive and the people I thought were my friends thought I had lost my mind. It was a hard pill to swallow, and I decided the best thing for me would be to move into a co-living apartment. Now that I can no longer comfortable afford living alone in NYC, I have decided to live below my means (I’ve got savings and investments as well) and try to live more consciously. 



The co-living company I chose is Outpost Club at their Hamilton House location in Harlem. It’s fully furnished and has everything I need, and it’s also shared with my other roommates. It’s really taught me to appreciate everyday items (the coffee maker, cookware) and respect them more as shared property. It’s made me far more mindful of my consumption of items and living with only the the necessities. I’m also so grateful I didn’t have to worry about finding my own roommates which can be difficult, and that I’ve formed relationships with some genuinely kind people.

I already have a partner and some friends/tropa from HS and college. But as we age, some of my friends' paths went on different ways like some of them went to abroad, some of them started a family and most of them are just really busy. I'm also fed up with rejections whenever I invite them but I do understand the reason cos they're busy na but sometimes I just miss hanging out with friends. That feeling na biglaan ""tara gala or coffee"" btw I don't have any friends who's gay. Mostly girls, straight men or lesb. All of them I met from school. I feel like my social life declined and stopped after graduating college. Since I didn't really work on the outside world I never met new friends after college because I got into our family's business after graduating. I tried to make friends with other people but it seems like most of the time they have intentions even if they know I already have a boyfriend. Like i can be friends with anyone (any gender, pronouns etc) no prob. But most of the time the only people who wants to be friends with me are gay men with secret or obvious intentions. I don't wanna brag but i'm actually kinda cute i think. I don't usually say that but I get the feeling that's the only reason they wanted to be friends with me and also expecting something from me. But I did made friends back then through my friends rin, like friends of friends thing but I really can't connect with them. They just have different interests. It didn't match. I just wish I could make new friends that are genuine, kind and wholesome with the some or same common interests. Also the reason that its quite hard to make new friends is because you've never bonded with them before. Sometimes I think about going back to school or take a masteral degree for the sake of meeting new people and connections

1h1uzye,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1h1uzye/there_wasnt_anyone_there/,"""There wasn't anyone there.""","Have you ever had someone who just doesn't take 'No' for an answer? Who just decides that you must have meant 'Yes' instead?

Tonight gentle readers, we have a tale of entitlement made manifest, of boundaries crossed, and the conventions of polite society ignored for the sake of convenience.

So of course I'm talking about water bottles.

Buttercup the emotional support unicorn is in her usual spot by the coffee station if anyone needs some magical sparkles or has some leftover pumpkin pie to share with a friendly unicorn.

So it came to pass that I was printing off a few reports when a guest comes to the desk. He's got a small fluffy white dog with him. No leash, but he's holding it, so I'm not going to gripe. But he is.

""There's no water in the room.""

Well hello and good evening to you too sir... But no water, that's a problem! Is it just the sink, or are the toilet and shower... Oh. He means there's no bottles of water in his room. We are a small hotel, we don't do that. I point out the water dispenser behind him, the drinking fountain around the corner, and the soda machine down the hall.

He is not happy, but he shuffles off towards the soda machine.

There is some puttering about, and then I notice him on one of the cameras. That's odd, the soda machine is over *there*, the only things that way is the breakfast storage room and the laundry. But he's holding two bottles of...Oh no the hell he *didn't*.

I hop out of the back room and startle him. Clutched in his hands are two bottles of ""LickRand"" water. These are the brand that are in our back room for making Shiny Member Goodie Bags. The vending machine is stocked with ""Insaned"" brand. 

""Excuse me. Did you just grab those from our Employees Only area?""

""Oh! ... There wasn't anyone there...""

He has very clearly grabbed those from our breakfast strorage room, the normally closed door standing wide open.

""Did you open a marked Employees Only area, go inside, and grab two bottles of water, without asking anyone?"" I don't often get to use Dad Voice, but at this point I'm making sure every word is being delivered in a way that conveys *exactly* how disappointed I am.

""... There wasn't anyone there?""

""You went into an area that was *clearly marked* as *off limits* to guests. You rummaged around *where you were not supposed to be* and you *stole* two bottles of water. *Why* did you think that was an okay thing to do?"" This is a nasty trick by the way. Framing a question that way forces him to realize that he had no real justification or valid reason for what he did.

""I... I can pay for them..?"" 

""If they were *for sale*, I would have *told you* when you asked. There is bottled water *for sale* in the vending machine behind you."" I hold out my hand and he glumly relents, giving me the bottles. I went past him, placed the bottles back onto their shelf, and made a point of closing and *locking* the door. He shuffled dejectedly away, never to bother anyone...

....oh, he's trying to chat up the gal who's enjoying a quiet evening in our lobby, finishing her paperwork while watching Golden Girls and drinking some beer. Ugh. I kept in view, in case she wanted an out, but she managed to convince him that she really did want to be left alone *thanks*.

In any case, I hope that everyone is having a wonderful day, which for many of us may involve roast turkey and stuffing and pie. Again, if you have too much pie, Buttercup will happily help. Take care, all!

She has been very open about when they meet and what they are up to, as they are just friends. But recently, they also meet each other without her telling me about it. If I ask it straightforward ""did he join"", she'll say it. If I ask how her day was, and ask about details, giving every opportunity to share it on her own, she won't share it (any more).

They are just friends: They see each other weekly because he joins her in a regular gymclass. He has told about his marital issues, expressed romantic feelings for her, and my SO has told him they can only be friends (all by her account). Sometimes he pushes this again (to her annoyance), by expressing hope that someday things can be different. He regularly asks her along for a coffee after class or other moments, or to go to events or activities, which she usually kindly refuses, and once a while accepts. For these activities she most often asks me if I'm ok with it, and then I am. Sometimes she accepts his plans, before asking me. But nowadays, they also meet without her mentioning it at all.

I have an anxious attachment style: It is good to know I am a more anxious and insecure type, thus know I might be overreacting. One doesn't have to share anything, have some freedom. Thus I also (tell myself) I don't mind her meeting him, planned or not. I also don't express my concerns to openly, because it would make it an issue. She did once mention she didn't just want to mention it when there was only a brief moment, because it could become a big issue. Though I have never made it an issue. The only thing I have shared is that I'd like to have her share it openly, because if she doesn't, I feel she is withholding things, which would make me worried that more is happening. I have also shared that I try to spend more time with her, but she often declines (just like she declines many invitations of him). 

Old issues: But I also have reasons to be anxious. In our pre-marriage relationship (>16y ago), when we were having more difficult times, she once left me for another guy who hit on her, while I was there too. That's a different story, but we ended up back together. A few years in (>8y ago), I also know there was a guy flirting with her, and there were fishy things. I checked her messages, saw things I didn't like (no sexual, there were just references to how much fun the company party was), confronted here, messages were immediately deleted, and after a while he left the picture.

Current suspicions: So now, whenever I feel anxious about possible others, I sometimes check her messages. This time I saw that they had planned to go for a coffee. After asking how the day was, she mentions she went to the shopping area where the coffee bar was, but nothing more. There was no rush and we chatted about quite a few things. I didn't want to ask it straightforward, as then I would expose me reading her chats. 

Thus there is my dilemma, I feel worried, but can't express it because I shouldn't be reading her texts. She also is allowed to see (like, literally, just see) other people, male or female. But I don't want to be cheated on. I don't know how to bring these things up, as bringing it up would indicate I have more information than I should have.

TL;DR:  
I know my SO had a coffee with someone who is romantically interested in her, did not tell me after asking how her day was and what she had been up to. Am I being overly insecure? And how can I establish expectations, without needing surveillance.",1,1732797049.0,relationships,10,0.67,False

ik its a bit too long but write it down and its gonna be worth it for ur whole life

if u cant consult a doctor a better option would be just spend some time in the sun whatever time u want to wake up like if u want to wake up at 5(no sun at that time agreeD) then be outside or rooftop or in the balcony for 15-20 minutes after sun rise do this at any cost even if u sleep afterwards in the day 
and in the evening spend some time in the dark (not dark dark ) like in the dawn time when is the sun is going down or already gone spend 20-30 minutes at that time too 
then at the time u sleep move your phone to other room 1hour or 45 minutes before u going to sleep i know its hard but u have to do it if u dont want to stay awake until 4-5 am doing nothing just scrolling. also if u can have dim lights 30-45 minutes before bedtime.

take a notebook or get a print of a excel table and mark daily write down your wake up and sleep time in the morning along with the markings to daily sunrise and sunset time (this will help u on the days u dont feel very good or the day u fail to do it)

most of the time we say its hard to sleep - its hard because we are continiosly feeding our brains keeping it stimulated if u cant sleep without phone here is a fun exercise u can use to sleep quickly 


Exercise- think of any letter then think about diffrent word starting from that letter fruits objects names anything at all then think about a memory ou anything u can remeber related to that word keep doing it for some time and u wont even know ur brain will get kind of overloaded and sleep for example - letter M- mango - (either describe it or try remebering any fun memory related to it )my brother and i used to eat kilos of mango evryday until i hit my teenage -TRY this exercise with a diffrent letter every day.



the moment u wake up wash your face then do something fun and uses brain something like wordle or any other puzzles like suduko then start studying-its like a kick start for the brain  (dont u dare check messages in the morning)  


for the caffine addicts out there - dont take coffee 9 hours before your sleep time or u wont be able to sleep well
try not to sleep in the day time coz then it will affect your sleep time at night 


do this for 15-20 days it will change ur sleep schedule
 i made this routine most of it from the sleep related podcats of dr hubermann and some other videos along with my own changes	


my experience- u might be thinking its too much or waste of time but i did this for just 10 days and now its a habbit now only if my times shifts i reinforce the sunset and sunrise regime thats the  actuall way of aligning ur circadinan rythm and it produces natural melatonin in ur body(hormone responsible for your body clock) and i started this in august and i used to wake up at 4am and sleep between 9-10 pm now i have shifted it because the time of waking and sunrise should not have a diffrence of more than 1:30 hours because then ull end up sleeping on the table(personally experimented and tested ) so as sun rises around 6:30 i wake up around 5 am



its not that hard uf u really want to do it and beleive me when i say this its much much better then waking up whole night- instagram has brainwashed people into thinking that they are night owls just so people use their app even more (thats how i think of it) most of you guys thought u were night owls started staying up late and now u feel wasted even after waking up from a 8 hour sleep.


this was all i had to say this was all my work in the past few months 

200%it will work if u follow this 2 of my friends have already fixed their sleep cycles others didnt took this seriously and still suffering dont make their mistake and ALL THE VERY BEST

Majority of the customers are from the town. I started working there 3 years ago when it was taken over from a new owner. It went from an old-man’s bar to a more modern bar. The regular customers that drink there have been there years.

There is one particular group that I am very fond of. It is a group of 7 people. 5 men and 2 women. The problem is, one of the members, ‘T’, is a creep. Like a really big creep. 

For some context on T, nobody knows anything about his background. He is not originally from the town, if I had to give a guess on an age I’d say maybe 50.

About 2 years ago there was a young girl(18) that was a waitress. We would talk to this whole group, all the same, we thought they were nice so didn’t think much else. T organises competitions in the bar. Everyone entering the competition is in a WhatsApp group chat, so he has everyone’s number. T would text the waitress random things. Then one night while she was working he tried to kiss her. She freaked out and called me the next day and I told her to report it to our supervisor. He wasn’t around for a bit, he came back, and she quit. One night she came in, and he kept trying to pull her to speak to him. She said no, and went out to the smoking area. He followed her and kept apologising, and asked could they meet for coffee and he could explain. She said no, she forgives him, but to leave her alone. 

A year later(2023)he sent a birthday card to her house, saying things like “happy birthday angel”, “miss and love you loads” and “see you soon?” And didn’t sign his own name. He done the same this year. Apparently he’d also text some of the young girls from the WhatsApp group links to love songs at 3:00am. 

So this brings us to the weekend just gone. I was speaking with another member from the group, “G”. I passed a comment on T being a creep, and he asked me why. So I told him this story and he looks horrified. He said he has heard about the kiss thing off of T, and that it was in a different location, and pretty much it was her coming onto him. G said he was thinking of distancing himself from T already, and this gave him more of a reason.

While in work last night, another member “N”, asked could he speak to me. He said G had told him about things that T has done, and that he is absolutely disgusted. They do not want to associate with somebody like that. That the members of that group are old enough to be us girls fathers and we should feel safe with them, not uncomfortable.

T seems to get along with everyone, and I now feel like I was wrong to say anything in the first place. I didn’t realise they didn’t know. They said they won’t mention me, for me not to worry, however they can’t sit back when this is not okay.

A staff member suggested a TK, but it looks like those aren't looked too highly upon. 

We have five coffee drinkers, plus we make it for clients. 
Looking for something around $1,000, but could go up some for a better machine. Happy to spend less too. 
Staff aren't coffee snobbs. They have been surviving on their morning Starbucks and our current kurieg.

1h1uq80,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h1uq80/aliexpress_baskets_nice_surprise/,Aliexpress baskets - nice surprise,"After a long and overwhelming [research](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1go2qep/novice_overwhelmed_by_options_grinder_machine/), I decided to jump into the espresso rabbit hole by buying Kingrinder K6 and Dedica 685 (knowing many flaws of the machine, but considering it will be appropriate first step).

I just got a package from AliExpress where I got a simple WDT tool, a funnel, MHW-3Bomber coffee scale and a mesh puck-screen, as well as a bottomless portafilter and two baskets.

To play around until the portafilter and new baskets come, I have initially drilled a hole in the second bottom of my originally pressurized portafilter to de-pressurize it, but still could never pull a good shot with it. Now I pulled a few shots with new baskets from Ali and, after a bit of dialing in, got a much more balanced, much more satisfying shot than ever before.

I will probably get a normcore/IMS basket down the road, but for now, I think ""CafeGaGa"" baskets and portafilter will do just fine. I have looked the baskets under the magnifying glass and found no metal shavings and the holes actually look pretty consistent for such a no-name cheap basket.

Is this just ""lottery"" or are there actually useful items on Ali (not regarding scales, WDT and similar tools)?

if u cant consult a doctor a better option would be just spend some time in the sun whatever time u want to wake up like if u want to wake up at 5(no sun at that time agreeD) then be outside or rooftop or in the balcony for 15-20 minutes after sun rise do this at any cost even if u sleep afterwards in the day 
and in the evening spend some time in the dark (not dark dark ) like in the dawn time when is the sun is going down or already gone spend 20-30 minutes at that time too 
then at the time u sleep move your phone to other room 1hour or 45 minutes before u going to sleep i know its hard but u have to do it if u dont want to stay awake until 4-5 am doing nothing just scrolling. also if u can have dim lights 30-45 minutes before bedtime.

take a notebook or get a print of a excel table and mark daily write down your wake up and sleep time in the morning along with the markings to daily sunrise and sunset time (this will help u on the days u dont feel very good or the day u fail to do it)

most of the time we say its hard to sleep - its hard because we are continiosly feeding our brains keeping it stimulated if u cant sleep without phone here is a fun exercise u can use to sleep quickly 


Exercise- think of any letter then think about diffrent word starting from that letter fruits objects names anything at all then think about a memory ou anything u can remeber related to that word keep doing it for some time and u wont even know ur brain will get kind of overloaded and sleep for example - letter M- mango - (either describe it or try remebering any fun memory related to it )my brother and i used to eat kilos of mango evryday until i hit my teenage -TRY this exercise with a diffrent letter every day.



the moment u wake up wash your face then do something fun and uses brain something like wordle or any other puzzles like suduko then start studying-its like a kick start for the brain  (dont u dare check messages in the morning)  


for the caffine addicts out there - dont take coffee 9 hours before your sleep time or u wont be able to sleep well
try not to sleep in the day time coz then it will affect your sleep time at night 


do this for 15-20 days it will change ur sleep schedule
 i made this routine most of it from the sleep related podcats of dr hubermann and some other videos along with my own changes	


my experience- u might be thinking its too much or waste of time but i did this for just 10 days and now its a habbit now only if my times shifts i reinforce the sunset and sunrise regime thats the  actuall way of aligning ur circadinan rythm and it produces natural melatonin in ur body(hormone responsible for your body clock) and i started this in august and i used to wake up at 4am and sleep between 9-10 pm now i have shifted it because the time of waking and sunrise should not have a diffrence of more than 1:30 hours because then ull end up sleeping on the table(personally experimented and tested ) so as sun rises around 6:30 i wake up around 5 am



its not that hard uf u really want to do it and beleive me when i say this its much much better then waking up whole night- instagram has brainwashed people into thinking that they are night owls just so people use their app even more (thats how i think of it) most of you guys thought u were night owls started staying up late and now u feel wasted even after waking up from a 8 hour sleep.


this was all i had to say this was all my work in the past few months 

200%it will work if u follow this 2 of my friends have already fixed their sleep cycles others didnt took this seriously and still suffering dont make their mistake and ALL THE VERY BEST ",20,1732796257.0,JEENEETards,17,0.96,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.
