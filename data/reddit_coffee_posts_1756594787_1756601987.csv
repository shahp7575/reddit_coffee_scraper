I'd often see $9.99 deals at Shoppers, and even Food Basics' store brand was ""Always"" $8.99... I distinctly recall seeing this as recently as last year.

Now, it seems $18-$20 is the new low, with some brands even going over $20! I know we're in a time of tariffs and other such economic factors... so I guess this is how we're seeing the effects of it now. 

Anyway, I wanted to see if anybody had any leads for where one might be able to find ground coffee at a reasonable price point. My neighbour and I (who shop for groceries together) both drink a lot of coffee and would like to stock up if there's anywhere that has it at a particularly good price. 

Lowest I've found so far is $14 for No Name at No Frills, and $14.97 for Great Value at Walmart. Just wondering if there's somewhere we haven't looked up where we might be able to realize more savings. ",1,1756601823.0,windsorontario,0,1.0,False

I'm 27 and I am obese but I've had a lot of test done due to my overwhelming constant feelings of a heart attack at times and I always get the same thing that everything is good and it's my anxiety.. well safttto say I'm having another episode and I'm trying to distinguish if it's anxiety or if I should actually be worrying. I'm have recently drunk a bunch of pop and a decent sized coffee and I'm have som back pain mostly mid between shoulders and sharp on and off pain in upper left shoulder (in the front) now these symptoms are the exact same as the ones I went to the er for 7 time for cause of I thought I was dieing and everything came back good. So I'm feeling defeated at the moment. I had a blood test done 2 weeks ago and everything came back good except my cholesterol was up. So I don't know if I'm over reacting again or what. I'm not asking for medical advice just looking to gain some understanding by the people who have experience a heart attack. Thank you",1,1756601577.0,HeartAttack,0,1.0,False
1n4hg0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n4hg0x/the_hollow_by_nora_roberts_free_read_online/,The Hollow by Nora Roberts Free  Read online,"Chapter One   
 FOX REMEMBERED MANY DETAILS OF THAT LONG-AGO day in June. The tear in the left knee in his father's Levi's, the smell of coffee and onions in Ma's Pantry, the crackle of the wrappers as he and his father opened Slim Jims in Mrs. Larson's kitchen.  
  
  But what he remembered most, even beyond the shock and the fear of what he'd seen in the yard, was that his father had trusted him.  
  
  He'd trusted him on the morning of Fox's tenth birthday, too, when Fox had come home, bringing Gage with him, both of them filthy, exhausted, and terrified, with a story no adult would believe.  
  
  There'd been worry, Fox reflected. He could still see the way his parents had looked at each other as he told them the story of something black and powerful and wrong erupting out of the clearing where the Pagan Stone stood.  
  
  They hadn't brushed it off as overactive imagination, hadn't even come down on him for lying about spending the night at Cal's and instead trooping off with his friends to spend the night of their tenth birthday in the woods west of town.  
  
  Instead they'd listened. And when Cal's parents had come over, they'd listened, too.  
  
  Fox glanced down at the thin scar across his wrist. That mark, one made when Cal had used his Boy Scout knife nearly twenty-one years before to make him, Cal, and Gage blood brothers, was the only scar on his body. He'd had others before that night, before that ritual-what active boy of ten didn't? Yet all of them but this one had healed smooth- as he'd healed from any injury since. Without a trace.  
  
  It was that mark, that mixing of blood, that had freed the thing trapped centuries before. For seven nights it had stormed through Hawkins Hollow.  
  
  They thought they'd beaten it, three ten-year-old boys against the unholy that infected the town. But it came back, seven years later, for seven more nights of hell. Then returned again, the week they'd turned twenty-four.  
  
  It would come back again this summer. It was already making itself known.  
  
  But things were different now. They were better prepared, had more knowledge. Only it wasn't just him, Cal, and Gage this time. They were six with the three women who'd come to the Hollow, who were connected by ancestry to the demon, just as he, Cal, and Gage were connected to the force that had trapped it.  
  
  Not kids anymore, Fox thought as he pulled up to park in front of the townhouse on Main Street that held his office and his apartment. And if what their little band of six had been able to pull off a couple weeks before at the Pagan Stone was any indication, the demon who'd once called himself Lazarus Twisse was in for a few surprises.  
  
  After grabbing his briefcase, he crossed the sidewalk. It had taken a lot of sweat and considerable financial juggling for Fox to buy the old stone townhouse. The first couple of years had been lean-hell, they'd been emaciated, he thought now. But they'd been worth the struggle, the endless meals of PB and J, because every inch of the place was his-and the Hawkins Hollow Bank and Trust's.  
  
  The plaque at the door read FOX B. O'DELL, ATTORNEY AT LAW. It could still surprise him that it had been the law he'd wanted-more that it had been small-town law.  
  
  He supposed it shouldn't. The law wasn't just about right and wrong, but all the shades between. He liked figuring out which shade worked best in each situation.  
  
  He stepped inside, and got a jolt when he saw Layla Darnell, one of that little band of six, behind the desk in his reception area. His mind went blank for a moment, as it often did if he saw her unexpectedly. He said, ""Um. . . ""  
  
  ""Hi. "" Her smile was cautious. ""You're back sooner than expected. ""  
  
  Was he? He couldn't remember. How was he supposed to concentrate with the hot-looking brunette and her mermaid green eyes behind the desk instead of his grandmotherly Mrs. Hawbaker? ""I-we-won. The jury deliberated less than an hour. ""  
  
  ""That's great. "" Her smile boosted up several degrees. ""Congratulations. That was the personal injury case? The car accident. Mr. and Mrs. Pullman?""  
  
  ""Yeah. "" He shifted his briefcase to his other shoulder and kept most of the pretty parlorlike reception area between them. ""Where's Mrs. H?""  
  
  ""Dentist appointment. It's on your calendar. ""  
  
  Of course it was. ""Right. I'll just be in my office. ""  
  
  ""Shelley Kholer called. Twice. She's decided she wants to sue her sister for alienation of affection and for. . . Wait. "" Layla picked up a message pad. ""For being a 'skanky, no-good ho'-she actually said 'ho. ' And the second call involved her wanting to know if, as part of her divorce settlement, she'd get her cheating butt-monkey of a soon-to-be-ex-husband's points for some sort of online NASCAR contest because she picked the jerkwad's drivers for him. I honestly don't know what that last part means except for jerkwad. ""  
  
  ""Uh-huh. Well, interesting. I'll call her. ""  
  
  ""Then she cried. ""  
  
  ""Shit. "" He still had a soft spot for animals, and had a spot equally soft for unhappy women. ""I'll call her now. ""  
  
  ""No, you'll want to wait about an hour,"" Layla said with a glance at her watch. ""Right about now she's getting hair therapy. She's going red. She can't actually sue her skanky, no-good ho of a sister for alienation of affection, can she?""  
  
  ""You can sue for any damn thing, but I'll talk her down from it. Maybe you could remind me in an hour to call her. Are you okay out here?"" he added. ""Do you need anything?""  
  
  ""I'm good. Alice-Mrs. Hawbaker-she's a good teacher. And she's very protective of you. If she didn't think I was ready to fly solo, I wouldn't be. Besides, as office manager in training, I should be asking you if you need anything. ""  
  
  An office manager who didn't jump-start his libido would be a good start, but it was too late for that. ""I'm good, too. I'll just be. . . "" He gestured toward his office, then walked away.  
  
  He was tempted to shut the pocket doors, but it felt rude. He never closed the doors of his office unless he was with a client who needed or wanted privacy.  
  
  Because he never felt quite real in a suit, Fox pulled off the jacket, tossed it over the grinning pig that served as one of the hooks. With relief, he dragged off his tie and draped it over a happy cow. That left a chicken, a goat, and a duck, all carved by his father, whose opinion had been that no law office could be stuffy when it was home to a bunch of lunatic farm animals.  
  
  So far, Fox figured that ran true.  
  
  It was exactly what he'd wanted in an office, something part of a house rather than a building, with a view of neighborhood rather than urban streets. Shelves held the law books and supplies he needed most often, but mingled with them were bits and pieces of him. A baseball signed by the one and only Cal Ripken, the stained-glass kaleidoscope his mother had made him, framed snapshots, a scale model of the Millennium Falcon, laboriously and precisely built when he'd been twelve.  
  
  And, in a place of prominence sat the big glass jar, and its complement of dollar bills. One for every time he forgot and said fuck in the office. It was Alice Hawbaker's decree.  
  
  He got a Coke out of the minifridge he kept stocked with them and wondered what the hell he was going to do when Mrs. Hawbaker deserted him for Minneapolis and he had to deal with the lovely Layla not only as part of the defeat-the-damn-demon team, but five days a week in his office.  
  
  ""Fox?""  
  
  ""Huh?"" He spun around from his window, and there she was again. ""What? Is something wrong?""  
  
  ""No. Well, other than Big Evil, no. You don't have any appointments for a couple of hours, and since Alice isn't here, I thought we could talk about that. I know you've got other work, but-""  
  
  ""It's okay. "" Big Evil would give him focus on something other than gorgeous green eyes and soft, glossy pink lips. ""Do you want a Coke?""  
  
  ""No, thanks. Do you know how many calories are in that can?""  
  
  ""It's worth it. Sit down. ""  
  
  ""I'm too jumpy. "" As if to prove it, Layla rubbed her hands together as she wandered the office. ""I get jumpier every day that nothing happens, which is stupid, because it should be a relief. But n  
othing's happened, nothing at all since we were all at the Pagan Stone. ""  
  
  ""Throwing sticks and stones and really harsh words at a demon from hell. ""  
  
  ""That, and Gage shooting at it. Or Cal. . . "" She stopped, faced Fox now. ""I still get shaky when I remember how Cal stepped right up to that writhing mass of black and shoved a knife into it. And now nothing, in almost two weeks. Before, it was nearly every day we saw it, felt it, dreamed of it. ""  
  
  ""We hurt it,"" Fox reminded her. ""It's off wherever demons go to lick their wounds. ""  
  
  ""Cybil calls it a lull, and she thinks it's going to come back harder the next time. She's researching for hours every day, and Quinn, well, she's writing. That's what they do, and they've done this before-this kind of thing if not this precise thing. First-timer here, and what I'm noticing is they're not getting anywhere. "" She pushed a hand through her dark hair, then shook her head so the sexy, jagged ends of it swung. ""What I mean is. . . A couple of weeks ago, Cybil had what she thought were really strong leads toward where Ann Hawkins might have gone to have her babies. ""  
  
  His ancestors, Fox thought. Giles Dent, Ann Hawkins, and the sons they'd made together. ""And they haven't panned out, I know. We've all talked about this. ""  
  
  ""But I think-I feel-it's one of the keys. They're your ancestors, yours, Cal's, Gage's. Where they were born may matter, and more since we have some of Ann's journals, we're all agreed there must be others. And the others may explain more about her sons' father. About Giles Dent. What was he, Fox? A man, a witch, a good demon, if there are such things? How did he trap what called itself Lazarus Twisse from that night in sixteen fifty-two until the night the three of you-""  
  
  ""Let it out,"" Fox finished, and Layla shook her head again.  
  
  ""You were meant to-that much we agree on, too. It was part of Dent's plan or his spell. But we don't seem to know any more than we did two weeks ago. We're stalled. ""  
  
  ""Maybe Twisse isn't the only one who needs to recharge. We hurt it,"" he repeated. ""We've never been able to do that before. We scared it. "" And the memory of that was enough to turn his gilded brown eyes cool with satisfaction. ""Every seven years all we've been able to do is try to get people out of the way, to mop up the mess afterward. Now we know we can hurt it. ""  
  
  ""Hurting it isn't enough. ""  
  
  ""No, it's not. "" If they were stalled, he admitted, part of the reason was his fault. He'd pulled back. He'd made excuses not to push Layla on honing the skill-the one that matched his own-that had been passed down to her.  
  
  ""What am I thinking now?""  
  
  She blinked at him. ""Sorry?""  
  
  ""What am I thinking?"" he repeated, and deliberately recited the alphabet in his head.  
  
  ""I told you before I can't read minds, and I don't want-""  
  
  ""And I told you it's not exactly like that, but close enough. "" He eased a hip onto the corner of his sturdy old desk, and brought their gazes more level. His conservative oxford-cloth shirt was open at the throat, and his bark brown hair waved around his sharp-featured face and brushed the back of his collar. ""You can and do get impressions, get a sense, even an image in your head. Try again. ""  
  
  ""Having good instincts isn't the same as-""  
  
  ""That's bullshit. You're letting yourself be afraid of what's inside you because of where it came from, and because it makes you other than-""  
  
  ""Human?""  
  
  ""No. Makes you 'other. ' "" He understood the complexity of her feelings on this issue. There was something in him that was other as well. At times it was more difficult to wear than a suit and tie. But to Fox's mind, doing the difficult was just part of living. ""It doesn't matter where it came from, Layla. You have what you have and are what you are for a reason. ""  
  
  ""Easy to say when you can put your ancestry back to some bright, shining light, and mine goes back to a demon who raped some poor sixteen-year-old girl. ""  
  
  ""Thinking that's only letting him score points off you. Try again,"" Fox insisted, and this time grabbed her hand before she could evade him.  
  
  ""I don't-stop pushing it at me,"" she snapped. Her free hand pressed against her temple.  
  
  It was a jolt, he knew, to have something pop in there when you weren't prepared. But it couldn't be helped. ""What am I thinking?""  
  
  ""I don't know. I just see a bunch of letters in my head. ""  
  
  ""Exactly. "" Approval spread in his smile, and reached his eyes. ""Because I was thinking of a bunch of letters. You can't go back. "" He spoke gently now. ""And you wouldn't if you could. You wouldn't just pack up, go back to New York, and beg your boss at the boutique to give you your job back. ""  
  
  Layla snatched her hand away as color flooded her cheeks. ""I don't want you prying into my thoughts and feelings. ""  
  
  ""No, you're right. And I don't make a habit of it. But, Layla, if you can't or won't trust me with what's barely under the surface, you and I are going to be next to useless. Cal and Quinn, they flash back to things that happened before, and Gage and Cybil get images, or even just possibilities of what's coming next. We're the now, you and me. And the now is pretty damn important. You said we're stalled. Okay then, let's get moving. ""  
  
  ""It's easier for you, easier for you to accept because you've had this thing. . . "" She waved a finger beside her temple. ""You've had this for twenty years. ""  
  
  ""Haven't you?"" he countered. ""It's more likely you've had it since you were born. ""  
  
  ""Because of the demon hanging on my family tree?""  
  
  ""That's right. That's an established fact. What you do about it's up to you. You used what you have a couple of weeks ago when we were on our way to the Pagan Stone. You made that choice. I told you once before, Layla, you've got to commit. ""  
  
  ""I have. I lost my job over this. I've sublet my apartment because I'm not going back to New York until this is over. I'm working here to pay the rent, and spending most of the time I'm not working here working with Cybil and Quinn on background, research, theories, solutions. ""  
  
  ""And you're frustrated because you haven't found the solution. Commitment's more than putting the time in. And I don't have to be a mind reader to know hearing that pisses you off. ""  
  
  ""I was in that clearing, too, Fox. I faced that thing, too. ""  
  
  ""That's right. Why is that easier for you than facing what you've got inside you? It's a tool, Layla. If you let tools get dull or rusty, they don't work. If you don't pick them up and use them, you forget how. ""  
  
  ""And if that tool's sharp and shiny and you don't know what the hell to do with it, you can do a lot of damage. ""  
  
  ""I'll help you. "" He held out his hand.  
  
  She hesitated. When the phone in the outer office began to ring, she stepped back.  
  
  ""Let it go,"" he told her. ""They'll call back. ""  
  
  But she shook her head and hurried out. ""Don't forget to call Shelley. ""  
  
  That went well, he thought in disgust. Opening his briefcase, he pulled out the file on the personal injury case he'd just won. Win some, lose some, Fox decided.  
  
  As he figured it was the way she wanted it, he stayed out of her way for the rest of the afternoon. It was simple enough to instruct her through interoffice e-mail to generate the standard power-of-attorney document with the specific names his client required. Or to ask her to prepare and send out a bill or pay one. He made what calls he needed to make himself rather than asking Layla to place them first. That kind of thing had always struck him as stupid in any case.  
  
  He knew how to use the damn phone.  
  
  He managed to calm Shelley down, catch up on paperwork, and win a game of online chess. But when he considered sending Layla another e-mail to tell her to go ahead and knock off for the day, he realized that came under the heading of avoidance, not just keeping the peace.  
  
  When he walked out to reception, Mrs. Hawbaker was manning the desk. ""I didn't know you were back,"" he began.  
  
  ""I've been back awhile. I've just finished proofing the papers Layla took care of for you. Need your signature on these letters. ""  
  
  ""Okay. "" He took the pen s  
he handed him, signed. ""Where is she? Layla?""  
  
  ""Gone for the day. She did fine on her own. ""  
  
  Understanding it was a question as much as an opinion, Fox nodded. ""Yeah, she did fine. ""  
  
  In her brisk way, Mrs. Hawbaker folded the letters Fox had signed. ""You don't need both of us here full-time and can't afford to be paying double either. ""  
  
  ""Mrs. H-""  
  
  ""I'm going to come in half days the rest of the week. "" She spoke quickly now, tucking letters into envelopes, sealing them. ""Just to make sure everything runs smoothly for you, and for her. Any problems, I can come in, help handle them. But I don't expect there to be. If there aren't problems, I won't be coming in after Friday next. We've got a lot of packing and sorting to do. Shipping things up to Minneapolis, showing the house. ""  
  
  ""Goddamn it. ""  
  
  She merely pointed her finger at him, narrowed her eyes. ""When I'm gone you can turn the air blue around here, but until I am, you'll watch your language. ""  
  
  ""Yes, ma'am. Mrs. H-""  
  
  ""And don't give me those puppy dog eyes, Fox O'Dell. We've been through all this. ""  
  
  They had, and he could feel her sorrow, and her fear. Dumping his own on her wouldn't help. ""I'll keep the F-word jar in my office, in memory of you. ""  
  
  That made her smile. ""The way you toss it around, you'll be able to retire a rich man on the proceeds of that jar. Even so, you're a good boy. You're a good lawyer, Fox. Now, you go on. You're clear for the rest of the day- what's left of it. I'm just going to finish up a couple things, then I'll lock up. ""  
  
  ""Okay. "" But he stopped at the door, looked back at her. Her snowy hair was perfectly groomed; her blue suit dignified. ""Mrs. H? I miss you already. ""  
  
  He closed the door behind him, and stuck his hands in his pockets as he walked down to the brick sidewalk. At the toot of a horn, he glanced over and waved as Denny Moser drove by. Denny Moser, whose family owned the local hardware store. Denny, who'd been a balletic third base-man for the Hawkins Hollow Bucks in high school.  
  
  Denny Moser, who during the last Seven had come after Fox with a pipe wrench and murder on his mind.  
  
  It would happen again, Fox thought. It would happen again in a matter of months if they didn't stop it. Denny had a wife and a kid now-and maybe this time during that week in July, he'd go after his wife or his little girl with a pipe wrench. Or his wife, former cheerleader and current licensed day-care provider, might slit her husband's throat in his sleep.  
  
  It had happened before, the mass insanity of ordinary and decent people. And it would happen again. Unless.  
  
  He walked along the wide brick sidewalk on a windy March evening, and knew he couldn't let it happen again.  
  
  Cal was probably still at the bowling alley, Fox thought. He'd go there, have a beer, maybe an early dinner. And maybe the two of them could figure out which direction to try next.  
  
  As he approached the Square, he saw Layla come out of Ma's Pantry across the street, carrying a plastic bag. She hesitated when she spotted him, and that planted a sharp seed of irritation in his gut. After she sent him a casual wave, they walked to the light at the Square on opposite sides of the street.  
  
  It might have been that irritation, or the frustration of trying to decide to do what would be natural for him-to wait on his side of the corner for her to cross and speak to her. Or to do what he felt, even with the distance, she'd prefer. For him to simply keep going up Main so they didn't intersect. Either way, he was nearly at the corner when he felt the fear-sudden and bright. It stopped him in his tracks, had his head jerking up.  
  
  There, on the wires crossing above Main and Locust, were the crows.  
  
  Dozens of them crowded together in absolute stillness along the thin wire. Hulking there, wings tucked and-he knew-watching. When he glanced across the street, he saw that Layla had seen them, too, either sensing them herself or following the direction of his stare.  
  
  He didn't run, though there was an urgent need to do just that. Instead he walked in long, brisk strides across the street to where she stood gripping her white plastic bag.  
  
  ""They're real. "" She only whispered it. ""I thought, at first, they were just another. . . but they're real. ""  
  
  ""Yeah. "" He took her arm. ""We're going inside. We're going to turn around, and get inside. Then-""  
  
  He broke off as he heard the first stir behind him, just a flutter on the air. And in her eyes, wide now, huge now, he saw it was too late.  
  
  The rush of wings was a tornado of sound and speed. Fox shoved her back against the building, and down. Pushing her face against his chest, he wrapped his arms around her and used his body to shield hers.  
  
  Glass shattered beside him, behind him. Brakes squealed through the crash and thuds of metal. He heard screams, rushing feet, felt the jarring force as birds thumped into his back, the quick sting as beaks stabbed and tore. He knew the rough, wet sounds were those flying bodies smashing into walls and windows, falling lifeless to street and sidewalk.  
  
  It was over quickly, in no more than a minute. A child shrieked, over and over-one long, sharp note after another. ""Stay here. "" A little out of breath, he leaned back so that Layla could see his face. ""Stay right here. ""  
  
  ""You're bleeding. Fox-""  
  
  ""Just stay here. ""  
  
  He shoved to his feet. In the intersection three cars were slammed together. Spiderwebs cracked the safety glass of windshields where the birds had flown into them. Crunched bumpers, he noted as he rushed toward the accident, shaken nerves, dented fenders.  
  
  It could have been much worse.  
  
  ""Everybody all right?""  
  
  He didn't listen to the words: Did you see that? They flew right into my car! Instead he listened with his senses. Bumps and bruises, frayed nerves, minor cuts, but no serious injuries. He left others to sort things out, turned back to Layla.  
  
  She stood with a group of people who'd poured out of Ma's Pantry and the businesses on either side. ""The damnedest thing,"" Meg, the counter cook at Ma's, said as she stared at the shattered glass of the little restaurant. ""The damnedest thing. ""  
  
  Because he'd seen it all before, and much, much worse, Fox grabbed Layla's hand. ""Let's go. ""  
  
  ""Shouldn't we do something?""  
  
  ""There's nothing to do. I'm getting you home, then we'll call Cal and Gage. ""  
  
  ""Your hand. "" Her voice was awe and nerves. ""The back of your hand's already healing. ""  
  
  ""Part of the perks,"" he said grimly, and pulled her back across Main.  
  
  ""I don't have that perk. "" She spoke quietly and jogged to keep up with his long, fast stride. ""If you hadn't blocked me, I'd be bleeding. "" She lifted a hand to the cut on his face that was slowly closing. ""It hurts though. When it happens, then when it heals, it hurts you. "" Layla glanced down at their clasped hands. ""I can feel it. ""  
  
  But when he started to let her go, she tightened her grip. ""No, I want to feel it. You were right before. "" She glanced back at the corpses of crows scattered over the Square, at the little girl who wept wildly now in the arms of her shocked mother. ""I hate that you were right and I'll have to work on that. But you were. I'm not any real help if I don't accept what I've got in me, and learn how to use it.

I’m trying to understand the lifestyle that awaits and mostly the kind of house I can buy in what neighborhood. 

I will have about $700k CAD once I move over (liquidated US stocks and savings). Our household income will be around $375k, maybe like $20k less or up to $50k more.

What is a realistic picture for our real estate prospects? We don’t have other debt. Our goals would be a semi-detached in an area like Roncesvalles or somewhere more on the West side of the city, I’d love a garage but would need at least 1 spot.

TLDR: Same rant as people have done before in this group (new to JC, need friends). My apologies for another. 22F, new grad! 

I feel like I've seen some of these posts, but I wanted to make my own to connect with people and share my experience & interests. I moved to JC about 3 months ago to start my new job in NYC. I thought my social life would be alright because I have college friends that live in Manhattan and Queens. I have learned the hard way that: 
1. Queens to West Side JC is a LONG commute. And it's not one that I want to do often.
2. It's hard to maintain a stable and reliable friendship without being physically close.

Overall, this post is to ask if any new grads are in the same situation? And if you're interested in being friends? I am 22F, love coffee shops, reading, and dancing. I have just started going to SolidCore because, now that I have time, I really want to get into fitness. I am not into drinking very much, but will enjoy a glass of wine here and there. And I have a cat! Cat lovers welcome! 

If you are reading this and have any advice for me, please also comment. I'm open to literally anything. Thanks!",6,1756601395.0,jerseycity,4,1.0,False
1n4he0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n4he0s/big_badd_wolf_by_jasinda_wilder_free_read_online/,Big Badd Wolf by Jasinda Wilder Free  Read online,"My teeth were chattering, my bones were shaking, and I was shivering uncontrollably. Jumping into frigid water in the middle of winter will do that to you. On top of it all, I was fighting an erection the size of Montana. The girl I had just rescued was seriously gorgeous and completely naked under the blanket I'd wrapped around her as soon as I'd gotten her to the bar and out of her wet clothes. I'd done my best to keep my gaze on hers while undressing her, but it had taken all of my not-inconsiderable willpower to do so--I'm a red-blooded, heterosexual male in the middle of a dry spell that's lasted over a year, and she's a woman with the body of a siren. Still, despite keeping my eyes on hers, I couldn't help seeing her body...and god in heaven, what a body.  
  
  Medium height--maybe five-five or six. Skin the color of rich, dark caramel, exotic and flawless. Black hair dreadlocked into dozens of dreads about the thickness of my thumb, the tips hanging to just above her waist. Eyes somewhere between tan and hazel, so light brown they appeared to be nearly golden--the eyes of a lioness. Those thighs? Those hips? Those breasts? Jesus. Perfect. I've never met a woman I'd describe as perfect looking, until now. And that's really the only word that comes to mind as an apt descriptor for Joss Mackenzie. Beautiful, yes. Lovely, yes. Sexy, hell yes. Curvy, absolutely. Exotic, for sure.  
  
  Okay, enough gushing.  
  
  Looks aside, I had questions for her, or rather, about her, which I won't ask right now. Such as:  
  
  How did she end up in the water?  
  
  Why was she wandering the Ketchikan docks in the middle of a blizzard?  
  
  Why were her clothes so...baggy?  
  
  I mean, I'm not one to judge someone based on their clothes, but this girl, Joss, had been wearing faded, tattered gray sweatpants underneath loose blue jeans clearly cut for a male, several sizes too big, with giant holes in the knees. Her coat, hat, and mittens looked brand new, but underneath the coat she'd been wearing a thin, aged red fleece jacket, and underneath that a voluminous NYU hoodie, and underneath that, several layers of shirts--a long sleeve thermal, what looked like a shirt from a long-johns set, and three more baggy T-shirts. Her hiking boots had holes in the toes and the soles were coming loose on both heels, and she was wearing three pairs of wool socks, all of which were old and well worn. Her undergarments were in no better shape--white cotton granny panties with holes in them, and a white bra with the underwire poking out in places.  
  
  I can put two and two together, and the story behind the multiple layers of clothing, and the condition of them is...sketchy.  
  
  But that was none of my business.  
  
  What was my business was keeping my front facing away from her until I could get my erection to subside.  
  
  When I managed to get myself under control and turned back around to face her, still wearing my soaking wet jeans, I said, ""I have to change. I'll grab you something to wear, too.""  
  
  She stared up at me with those golden-brown eyes. ""Just throw mine in the dryer for a few minutes. I'll put them on as soon as possible and get out of your way.""  
  
  I snorted. ""Not likely.""  
  
  She frowned. ""What do you mean?""  
  
  ""This blizzard isn't going to let up anytime soon, which means you're stuck here with us for the time being. So you might as well take a long hot shower and put on clean, dry clothes.""  
  
  ""I don't have any clean or dry clothes."" She gestured at the backpack on the floor nearby. ""That's got all my clothing in it, and it went swimming with me.""  
  
  ""Lucky for you my sister-in-law lives here, and she's close enough to your size that she'll have something you can wear.""  
  
  She sighed. ""Okay. But as soon as the snow lets up, I'll leave you alone.""  
  
  ""You're fine. No worries."" I twisted the doorknob and exited the room on shaky knees.  
  
  I was playing tough for the sake of appearances in front of Joss, but I was feeling the effects of the icy water myself. Once out of the room, I let myself slump back against the wall, tugging my hair out of the ponytail holder.  
  
  Bast and Dru were in the kitchen, anxious to hear my side of the story.  
  
  ""What the fuck happened, Luce?"" Bast asked. ""Who's the girl and why are you both wet?""  
  
  ""I need a change of clothes,"" I said, rather than answering his question. ""For myself and for her. No way in hell I'm going to my place now--I barely made it here.""  
  
  Dru went into their room and emerged a minute later with two stacks of their clothes--yoga pants and a hoodie for Joss, and a pair of drawstring track pants and a hoodie for me.  
  
  ""Thanks,"" I said. ""I'm gonna get her in the shower. Can you make some coffee?""  
  
  Dru just nodded, and Bast stood with his arms crossed over his powerful chest.  
  
  I stepped into the bathroom, flicked on the hot water, and stripped out of my wet jeans and underwear. I rinsed the cold water out of my hair and off my body, and then got out much sooner than I'd have liked. I toweled off, wrung my hair out and left it loose--a rarity for me--and then donned the clothes borrowed from my oldest brother. They were huge on me as Bast is a couple inches taller than me and at least fifty pounds heavier, but they were warm and dry, and the drawstring let me keep the pants from falling off. I left the hot water running, put the clean clothes on the closed toilet seat lid, and returned to see Joss.  
  
  She was sitting where I left her, wrapped in the blanket, shivering, teeth clenched together, looking wet and miserable and uncomfortable, and beautiful as hell despite it all.  
  
  ""I've got clean clothes in the bathroom for you, and the hot water is running."" I held out my hand to her. ""Here, let me help you up.""  
  
  She ignored my hand and stood up on her own, but it was obvious she was weak still, and shaky. ""Just show me the bathroom.""  
  
  I frowned at her sharp response, but shrugged it off. ""Okay.""  
  
  She held the blanket tight around her, and seemed to be trying to shrink as small as she could, especially when I entered the bathroom behind her. She shrank away from me, her fists clenched into the fleece of the blanket, huddling against the bathroom wall, as far away from me as she could get.  
  
  ""I know how a shower works,"" she snapped. ""I don't need help.""  
  
  I blinked, surprised. ""I was just--you almost died. I don't want you to pass out in the shower, or fall and hurt yourself.""  
  
  Dismissively, she said, ""I can manage. I'll be fine, thank you.""  
  
  I held up both hands palms out. ""Okay, then. Take as long as you want.""  
  
  ""I will, once you leave the room.""  
  
  Wow, okay. Better add snarky and ungrateful to the list of descriptors.  
  
  I backed out, closed the door behind me, and went into the kitchen. The scent of brewing coffee filled my nostrils, and I inhaled deeply as I slumped exhaustedly into a chair at the breakfast table. Dru was at the stove, cracking eggs into a blue ceramic bowl two at a time. Bast reached into a cupbo  
ard and snagged a chipped white mug with the logo of an alcohol distributor on it, poured coffee into it, and handed the mug to me; the coffeemaker gurgled and hissed as it resumed brewing.  
  
  Sitting kitty-corner to me, Bast rested his thick, tattooed forearms on the edge of the table.  
  
  ""So, why'd you go swimming in the Passage in the middle of a blizzard in December?"" he asked.  
  
  I sighed. ""We're out of real food over at the other apartment, so I was heading over here to make something for lunch. I heard a splash."" I sipped the hot, bitter coffee; Dru makes coffee the way our family likes it best--strong enough to float horseshoes in it. ""I went to see what the splash was, figuring in this weather, at this time of year, since a splash that loud probably meant trouble.""  
  
  Bast glanced past me at the bathroom, where the shower could be heard running, along with the faint hint of a female voice singing something. ""The splash was her, I take it?""  
  
  I nodded. ""Yeah. I jogged across the street to the docks, and saw her in the water.""  
  
  ""And jumped in after her,"" Bast filled in.  
  
  ""Well...yeah. I mean, she'd have died in that water. It's cold, man."" I shrugged. ""She's...prickly, so I don't really know much.""  
  
  A few minutes later, I heard the bathroom door open, turned around in my chair to watch steam billow out of the doorway, and then Joss emerged, wearing Dru's yoga pants and hoodie. Dru was a couple inches taller than Joss, and slightly more slender, so the pants were tighter on Joss than they would have been on Dru, which meant they were tight. The hoodie was an old one of Dru's, a faded gray with ""Seattle Police Department"" emblazoned across the chest. It fit Joss like a glove--maybe a little too well, especially for my libido, which had once again sat up and taken notice of this girl. She wasn't wearing a bra, obviously, and when she walked out of the bathroom and down the hall toward the kitchen, her lack of...erm, support...was evident in the way her breasts swayed under the soft, thin, faded cotton. She had a towel in her hands and was squeezing it around her dreads to dry them as she entered the kitchen.  
  
  Bast gestured at an open seat on the other side of me. ""Have a seat. Dru's got some eggs and bacon finishing up. Hungry?""  
  
  She took the offered seat hesitantly, still sponging at her dreadlocks. ""I--no, thanks. I'm fine.""  
  
  Her stomach growled volubly at that moment, though, putting a lie to her demurral.  
  
  Dru laughed again, plated a few strips of bacon and a heaping pile of eggs, and set it in front of Joss. ""Hope you're not a vegan."" She then divided the rest between the three of us.  
  
  Joss snorted. ""Umm, no."" She sucked in a deep breath, held it, and let it out slowly. ""I guess I am a little hungry. Thank you very much."" She picked up the fork and stabbed some scrambled eggs. ""I've never had eggs and bacon in the middle of the afternoon before.""  
  
  ""We like to eat what we want, when we want around here, and eggs and bacon is good anytime."" Bast tipped backward in his chair, tugged open the fridge, reached in, and pulled out a bottle of hot sauce, a jar of salsa, and a container of sour cream, and piled the lot in front of Joss. ""Dig in.""  
  
  Joss stared at the array of condiments and then, hesitantly, reached for the salsa and sour cream. She glanced around as she took a dainty spoonful of sour cream, as if wondering if it was even okay to do so.  
  
  Bast cleared his throat. ""Don't know how you do it where you're from, but around here, we don't skimp. So pile that shit on, babe.""  
  
  Joss eyed him, hesitated again, and then dug a larger glop of sour cream and piled it on. ""Better?"" she asked, eyebrow lifted.  
  
  Bast laughed. ""Hey, I just meant to not be shy about it. We won't bite."" He paused, and then jerked a thumb at me. ""Well, Luce here is kind of a wild card, so you never know about him.""  
  
  I glared at him. ""Really, Bast?""  
  
  Bast chortled. ""I'm just fuckin' with you. Luce don't bite.""  
  
  I glanced at Joss. ""Don't mind him. He's just an idiot who doesn't know when to stop.""  
  
  Joss paused in the act of spooning salsa onto her eggs, glancing between Bast and me. ""Bast? His name--your name is Bast?"" She stirred her eggs with her fork. ""Like...Bast, daughter of Ra, Egyptian goddess of cats?""  
  
  Bast frowned. ""Wait, what?""  
  
  Joss shrugged. ""That's who Bast is, in Egyptian mythology. Depicted as a woman with the head of a lioness.""  
  
  ""Well, I don't know shit about Egyptian mythology,"" Bast said. ""My name's Sebastian, but everyone calls me Bast.""  
  
  ""Oh. Well...that's marginally less interesting."" Joss blinked, as if realizing what she'd just said. ""I--I mean, um. Shit.""  
  
  Bast was belly laughing. ""No, no, don't apologize, that was funny."" He glanced at me. ""You fished yourself a winner out of the Passage, Luce. Damn.""  
  
  ""Passage?"" Joss asked.  
  
  ""The Inside Passage,"" I answered, pouring coffee for everyone else and setting it to brew another pot. ""Don't know how much you know about the local geography--""  
  
  ""Pretty much zero,"" Joss cut in.  
  
  ""Well, Ketchikan is located on what's called the Inside Passage, a coastal route through all the little islands around here.""  
  
  ""Oh.""  
  
  Bast eyed Joss as he added hot sauce and sour cream to his eggs. ""So. Who're you?""  
  
  ""Joss Mackenzie,"" she answered, after swallowing her bite.  
  
  ""Well, Luce you know, I'm Bast, and this is my wife Dru. There are a bunch more of us around, you'll probably meet the rest of them later, though.""  
  
  ""More?"" Joss sounded a little alarmed by this. ""There are more of you?""  
  
  I snickered. ""I'm the second youngest of eight brothers.""  
  
  She blinked at me, absorbing this. ""Eight--you have...seven brothers?""  
  
  ""Yep.""  
  
  ""And...they all live here?"" She turned to glance at the hallway, trying to figure out the room math.  
  
  Bast cackled. ""Oh, hell no. There's another apartment down the street, and several of our brothers live close by with their wives or girlfriends. Can you imagine all eight of us plus women in this little apartment? Jesus.""  
  
  ""Wait--eight brothers plus wives and girlfriends...how many of you are there?""  
  
  ""Umm..."" I counted on my fingers as I listed everyone. ""Bast and Dru, Zane and Mara--plus Jax, Brock and Claire, Bax and Eva, Cane and Aerie, Cor and Tate, me, and Xavier, so...fifteen?""  
  
  Joss chewed, swallowed, and blinked, looking overwhelmed. ""Wow. That's...that's a lot of people.""  
  
  ""Only child?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Uh...something like that,"" she answered.  
  
  Dru, now seated with her own food and coffee, wiggled her fork at Joss. ""Oh, she's totally an only child.""  
  
  Joss frowned. ""How do you know?""  
  
  ""I recognize that look on your face,"" Dru said. ""I'm an only child too. I was the first woman to snag a Badd brother, and let me tell you, trying to civilize this pack of wolves has been...amusing, shall we say.""  
  
  ""How bad can they really be? Lucian seems okay, so far."" Joss allowed the tiniest hint of a smirk to touch the corners of her mouth, the first sign of amusement or humor I'd seen from her.  
  
  Dru burst out laughing, and had to cover her mouth with her hand, as she had a mouthful of food. ""Oh, honey. No--the brothers, their last name is Badd, B-A-D-D."" She grinned at Joss. ""And, as the first Badd girl, I can testify that they can be all kinds of bad."" She punctuated this with a suggestive wiggle of her eyebrows.  
  
  Joss colored. ""I didn't mean--"" She seemed unable to explain what she meant, and didn't finish her statement.  
  
  ""Don't scandalize the poor girl, Dru. Jesus."" Bast managed to say this with a straight face. ""Can't you see she doesn't find your crude humor entertaining?""  
  
  ""My crude humor?"" Dru protested. ""You're the one who thinks it's funny to smack my ass in public.""  
  
  ""You're my wife. I'm allowed.""  
  
  ""Yeah, but not in front other people, you goddamned orc.""  
  
  Joss spluttered at this, and tried to cover it with a cough.  
  
  Bast winked at her. ""It's okay to laugh, Joss. You landed smack dab in the middle of a bunch of real comedians.""  
  
  ""So I'm finding out."" Joss  
had cleared her plate already, and I'd only gotten started. ""That was delicious, Dru. Thank you.""  
  
  Dru eyed the plate in surprise. ""Damn, girl."" She set her fork down. ""Still hungry? I can whip up some more real quick.""  
  
  Joss looked almost a little frightened. ""Oh, no. No, thank you. I'm fine.""  
  
  Dru narrowed her eyes. ""Sure? It's no trouble. How about some toast?""  
  
  Joss shook her head. ""Oh, no. Really. I wouldn't want to...I mean, I don't want to be an inconvenience."" She looked at me. ""I can't thank you enough for rescuing me, Lucian, but I really should be going.""  
  
  ""This blizzard is gonna blow for a few days yet,"" I said. ""I live here and I barely made it a quarter of a block from my apartment to here. You really should just hang out until it blows over.""  
  
  ""Ain't an inconvenience if we're offering,"" Bast said.  
  
  ""I just--"" Joss shifted on her chair, toying with the fork. ""If you're sure it's not a problem, I could probably eat a piece of toast or something. And then I really will go. I'll find a hotel or something.""  
  
  I snorted. ""Not much to choose from, and they're all full.""  
  
  Joss shook her head. ""I'll figure something out. I just met you. Lucian already jumped into the bay--the Passage, I mean--saving me. You've made me food, given me clothes. I can't--I couldn't impose on you any more than I already have.""  
  
  I twisted in my chair to face her more directly. ""Joss, it's fine. Really.""  
  
  ""Shit, babe, you heard the count,"" Bast said. ""Fifteen of us. You think one more person is gonna, what, put us out of business?""  
  
  ""Out of business?"" Joss asked. ""What business?""  
  
  ""Well, it was a figure of speech, but we own a bar. It's downstairs.""  
  
  Joss wrapped a finger around a dreadlock, while Dru popped bread into the toaster. ""Let me get this straight. There are eight brothers, your last name is Badd, and you own a bar in Alaska?""  
  
  Dru nodded seriously. ""And the other brothers are all just as sexy as these two. Legit.""  
  
  Joss blushed again. ""I hadn't noticed,"" she said, glancing down.  
  
  Dru blew a raspberry. ""Oh bullshit you haven't noticed. You wouldn't be blushing if you hadn't noticed that Lucian here isn't exactly hard on the eyes."" She bumped her hip against Bast's arm as she walked past him. ""And my macho fuckstick orc of a husband is pretty nice to look at, too.

At that moment, Xavier, Brock, Claire, Bax, Eva, Zane, Mara, and little baby Jax all trooped in; everyone except Xavier was coated with snow, which meant the others had just arrived from their respective homes while Xavier had been downstairs doing who knew what. The noise level increased, well...nine-fold, at least, as they all tromped in, half a dozen different conversations going on at once.  
  
  Joss froze, and the knuckles of the hand gripping the fork went white. ""Holy shit,"" she muttered under her breath. ""More people. Great.""  
  
  ""Not a fan of people?"" I asked.  
  
  She blushed yet again, not looking at me. ""No, I like people okay, I'm just--it's just--"" she shook her head. ""It's fine. I'm fine. Forget I said anything.""  
  
  ""They're all cool. Just relax.""  
  
  ""Easy for you to say."" This was more to herself than to me, though, and she took a deep breath and straightened her spine.  
  
  ""Let me see my nephew,"" Bast said, in his loud, booming bartender voice, cutting in over the chatter. Mara handed Jax to Bast, who immediately softened, taking the six-month-old baby in his arms and muttering at him, his gruff, growling voice gone tender. ""Hey there, little man. How ya doin', champ? Oh man, look at that grip--you're a monster! Oh yeah, get it, boy. Grab it! There ya go...""  
  
  Joss stared at Bast, as amused as everyone else as the big, burly, tattooed Bast went all Papa Bear with Jax.  
  
  ""It's like watching a pit bull play with a kitten,"" she said to me.  
  
  ""It kind of is, isn't it?"" I said, chuckling.  
  
  Joss was breathing slowly and evenly, as if trying to regulate her breathing to prevent a panic attack. ""So many people.""  
  
  They were all clustered in the kitchen--Zane was pouring coffee, Claire was buttering toast, Mara was rummaging in the fridge, Brock and Xavier were raiding the snack cupboard, and Bax and Eva were twisting the tops off of beers. The previously quiet four-way conversation around the kitchen table had turned into 11/15 of the full Badd family experience. All we needed now was--  
  
  Corin, Canaan, Tate, and Aerie.  
  
  And about ten seconds later the four of them, involved in a loud four-way argument about the merits of a certain band's early work versus their newer material, came in through the doorway which led up from the bar.  
  
  ""Fuck me running,"" Joss muttered.  
  
  I laughed, then. ""That's everyone.""  
  
  Joss was losing the battle against hyperventilation. ""This is...a lot.""  
  
  I eyed her--she was pale, and her hands were trembling. ""Too much?""  
  
  She nodded. ""Yeah."" She backed her chair out and stood up. ""I'm gonna...I'm gonna go. Thanks. I just--I have to go.""  
  
  I stood up with her and caught her arm; I didn't miss the way she tensed at my touch. ""Hey, I know there's a lot of us, but--""  
  
  ""Lucian, I really, really appreciate you saving me. I'll never be able to repay you for that. But this is just...I need to go.""  
  
  ""Where are you going to go? I'm not trying to, like, trap you here, but this blizzard is no joke--I'm not even sure how the ferry made it in.""  
  
  Zane sidled up, mug of coffee in hand. ""Luce. Who's your friend, bro?""  
  
  ""This is Joss Mackenzie. Joss, this my second oldest brother, Zane.""  
  
  Joss and Zane shook hands, and Zane eyed Joss. ""Heard you talking about leaving, and I gotta say that's a bad plan. I grew up here, and we only live a couple blocks away, and the trip here was harrowing as fuck. I didn't realize how bad it was myself until we were halfway there; if I had known, we wouldn't be here in the first place. If you don't have to be anywhere, stay.""  
  
  Zane's attention on Joss brought everyone's attention to her, and soon she was inundated with questions, introductions, handshakes, and a gentle hug from Eva.  
  
  Seeing that Joss was seriously struggling, I knew I had to do something to ease her tension. I put my fingers to my lips and blew a piercing whistle, which silenced conversation. ""This is a hell of a lot of people in a very small space,"" I said. ""Why don't we move this party downstairs to the bar? With the weather being the way it is, I say we keep the bar closed and just have a family day.""  
  
  Bast groaned. ""Well, there goes my overhead for the month.""  
  
  Xavier, a jar of peanuts in hand, spoke up. ""Actually, speaking as the one who does the books, we made enough just on the day before Thanksgiving to cover our overhead for December."" He popped a handful of peanuts into his mouth. ""So, you know...we're good.""  
  
  Somehow or another, everyone ended up downstairs. Several tables were shoved together to make room for everyone, and Bast and Zane headed behind the bar to pour a few pitchers of beer.  
  
  Xavier wandered toward the kitchen, stopping to tap me on the shoulder on the way past. ""Help me in the kitchen, Luce? I'm gonna fry up some snacks.""  
  
  I stood up. ""Sounds good.""  
  
  Joss was standing in the middle of the bar, several feet away from everyone, shoulders hunched, just watching as my family settled in, tossing jokes and insults back and forth, telling stories, doing what we do.  
  
  I'd never met anyone so socially uncomfortable and standoffish my life, and I wondered, not for the first time since pulling Joss out of the water, what her story was.  
  
  2  
  
  Joss  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  I'd never seen so many beautiful people in one place in my entire life. Literally, not one of them was anything less than stunning looking, but each in their own way.  
  
  The Badd brothers were, easily, eight of the sexiest men I'd ever seen in one place. All the men were easily identified as brothers with their rich, thick, deep brown hair and, except for Xavier, they all had expressive mocha brown eyes. What a gene pool.  
  
  Luce, though... was the only one who made my heart pound. There was ...something about him. I couldn't identify it or place it, beyond raw physical attraction to a gorgeous man. Which in itself was unusual for me, as my life had not, over the past few years, lent itself to idle nonsense like crushes on guys. I'd been too wrapped up in survival to be bothered with guys. But Lucian? It was impossible not to be attracted to him. He gave off a quiet, mysterious, calm confidence. His eyes, whenever they landed on me, seemed to see into me, into my soul. I'd exchanged a handful of words with him, and knew literally nothing about him nor he about me, but I...  
  
  I felt like I knew him, somehow.  
  
  But this didn't explain why I was in an industrial kitchen, standing at a massive grill, helping Lucian flip two dozen burger patties. Nor why I kept forgetting to breathe whenever Lucian got too close to me, when his thigh nudged mine, or his hip bumped mine, or his elbow brushed mine. Nor did it explain why I was so reluctant to leave, so eager to stay here in this bar and have this meal with this enormous gathering of people--these perfect strangers.  
  
  Lucian prodded a few of the patties with his spatula, and then glanced at me. ""So. How'd you end up in the Passage?""  
  
  ""I fell in. Didn't see the edge.""  
  
  He frowned. ""Right, but what were you doing on the docks in the first place?""  
  
  ""Walking.""  
  
  Lucian laughed. ""I thought I was terse, but wow."" He bumped me with his hip. ""You're taking uncommunicative to a new level.""  
  
  ""I'm uncomfortable with personal questions."" I poked a patty with the tip of my spatula. ""I have no idea how to tell whether these are done.""  
  
  Lucian's eyebrow quirked up. ""You've never made hamburgers before?""  
  
  How to admit to that without answering a lot of personal questions? I didn't want him to see me as...well, as what I was--a homeless orphan.  
  
  I just shrugged. ""I don't cook a lot.""  
  
  He nodded. ""Fair enough, I suppose. Well, we're going for a nice medium. Take your flipper and poke a little hole in the burger with the corner of it, pry the hole open, and see what color it is in the middle.""  
  
  I frowned at him. ""Flipper?""  
  
  He lifted his...what I'd been thinking of as a spatula. ""This. It's a flipper.""  
  
  ""I thought it was a spatula.""  
  
  Xavier, at the deep fryers, reached over to an open-sided metal shelving unit, grabbed and held up three different utensils. ""The word 'spat  
ula' is, in fact, an umbrella category for a whole wide array of kitchen utensils. It is not incorrect to call that device you're holding a spatula, but it is, more accurately, a flipper or turner."" He held up the thing you'd use to scrape the last of the pancake batter out of a bowl. ""This is also a spatula, but it is correctly termed a scraper."" He held up a slotted, wide-bladed...um, thing. ""This is also spatula. But they each have different specific names and uses.""  
  
  That eyebrow of Lucian's arched yet again-- I was noticing he could communicate a wide variety of emotions with just that one eyebrow. ""Thank you, Xavier, for that highly informative breakdown on spatulas.""  
  
  ""You're welcome."" Xavier seemed to have completely missed his brother's searing sarcasm.  
  
  I gripped my...utensil, and followed Lucian's instructions. ""So. I've used my spatula flipper mc-deal thingy to poke a hole. What color is it supposed to be inside?""  
  
  ""A nice pink. Not too red, like raw, but not brown all the way through either.""  
  
  I peeked inside the patty. ""Well, this one looks kind of like that.""  
  
  Lucian looked too. ""Yeah, that one's done."" He gestured to the patties on the grill, in rows of four burgers across. ""I put these on here back to front, so the burgers closer to the back will be done before the ones in front. So we can probably start taking the ones farther back off the grill.""  
  
  We stacked the burgers on a giant platter, and then Xavier took the platter, along with a giant bowl full of French fries, and another full of chicken tenders, out to the table.  
  
  ""So,"" I said. ""We're done cooking burgers?""  
  
  Lucian laughed as he opened a refrigerator unit nearby and pulled out a tray of patties. ""Hardly. That's only twenty-four burgers.""  
  
  I stared at him. ""Only twenty-four?""  
  
  ""Have you seen my brothers?"" He gestured through the open doorway, to where Bast, Bax, Brock, and Zane were standing in a line abreast, each of them holding a pitcher of beer in one hand. ""That plate will be empty in five minutes.""  
  
  ""Are they...are they competing to see who can drink an entire pitcher of beer the fastest?"" I asked.  
  
  Lucian leaned backward and watched through the doorway for a moment, and then nodded. ""Looks like it.""  
  
  ""It's two in the afternoon. On a Wednesday.""  
  
  ""We own the bar, and the bar's closed for the day."" Lucian shrugged. ""That's my brothers for you.""  
  
  ""Who will win, do you think?"" I asked.  
  
  Lucian snorted as he laid patties on the grill. ""Bax, by a lot. Zane won't be far behind, Bast will be third, and Brock last.""  
  
  I watched the contest: When one of the twins--I wasn't sure which was which--said ""Go!"" all four men lifted the pitchers to their mouths and began chugging. Sure enough, it was clear within seconds that Bax was going to win. He finished the pitcher faster than I'd have believed possible, and Zane was only a few seconds slower. There was a lot of cheering as Bax finished, each of the women howling for her man. It was a loud, boisterous event, this chugging competition. And then, to cap it all off, Bax held up a finger, quieting everyone, and then let loose a belch so loud I think the glass of the windows rattled.  
  
  I shook my head at the spectacle. ""That's disgusting.""  
  
  ""The burp or the chugging?""  
  
  ""Yes.""  
  
  ""Oh, come on."" He rolled his eyes at me. ""Like you've never chugged beer before?""  
  
  And here we were again, at an awkward question. ""No. I don't chug. Beer or anything else.""  
  
  Lucian made a sarcastic face. ""Well pardon me, m'lady. Sorry my family offends your delicate sensibilities.""  
  
  I stepped away from him, one hand on my hip. ""Fuck off."" I flipped him the bird. ""I said nothing about you or your brothers, just that I don't chug.""  
  
  ""Have you ever tried it? It's fun.""  
  
  I rolled a shoulder, discomfort rifling through me. ""I'm...not twenty-one yet.""  
  
  ""Neither am I."" He just waved a hand. ""It's a family party, so it's not like anyone's going to report us. No big deal.""  
  
  ""Not interested.""  
  
  He sighed. ""Suit yourself."" He flipped burgers, each motion neat and smooth and economical.  
  
  ""I feel like you're judging me."" I helped him flip, but made sure to stand far enough away that he couldn't make contact with me again.  
  
  ""I could say the same.""  
  
  ""I just...drinking like that isn't my thing.""  
  
  ""Look, I'm just trying to make you feel at home, okay?"" Lucian met my eyes. ""I know we can be loud and crude and vulgar, but we're good people.""  
  
  ""I don't doubt that. I'm just...I'm used to being on my own.""  
  
  ""Yeah, I can tell.""  
  
  I whirled to face him. ""What's that supposed to mean?""  
  
  His gaze on mine was even and unruffled. ""You don't answer the smallest, most innocuous question."" He shrugged and turned his eyes to the grill. ""You're prickly.""  
  
  ""Well what, you want my life story within ten minutes of meeting me?""  
  
  ""No, but you could pretend to be interested in, oh, I don't know...basic conversation?""  
  
  ""I don't know you. I don't know them. I'm new to Ketchikan."" I threw both hands in the air in an I-give-up gesture. ""This whole day has been kinda overwhelming for me.""  
  
  He did the eyebrow again. ""The whole day? It's not even three o'clock in the afternoon.""  
  
  I sighed, and set down the spatula...flipper...whatever. ""Look, it's just been a very, very, very long day for me. Falling into the water was just the cherry on top. And then you saved me, and then you have a million brothers and sisters-in-law and whatever, and now there's a chugging contest, and I'm just...it's a fucking lot to take in, okay?""  
  
  With a nod, Lucian seemed content to let it go, and we finished cooking the burgers in silence. When they were done, Lucian stacked the finished burgers onto another platter. ""Come on. Come sit and eat.""  
  
  ""We just had eggs and bacon.""  
  
  ""And now we're having burgers and fries."" He led the way to the table, where two spaces had been saved for us, sandwiched between the two sets of twins who seemed to be married to each other, or something. ""If you're not hungry, don't eat. If you're hungry, eat.""  
  
  ""Oh is that how it works?"" I asked sarcastically. ""I had no idea how appetites function.""  
  
  Lucian hadn't been kidding when he said the first platter would be gone in minutes; by the time we sat down, the platter was totally empty, and Bax reached for another burger even as Lucian set the platter down.  
  
  Bast eyed me as I sat, spine straight, hands on my lap. ""Want a beer, Joss?

  “Fuck” I mumbled to myself as water droplets trickled down my face. I had spent my night out with Angela and was now running behind schedule. I grabbed a hand towel and patted my face dry as I looked at my reflection. I was going against everything I stood for by being with a married woman. Not because I thought it was morally wrong, but because I did not like to share. In fact, I hated to fucking share. She reassured me her marriage was all but over and she and her husband barely acknowledged each other’s existence, let alone slept together. I did not believe her but I never saw what we had being anything long term. I was using her as much as she was using me.  
  
  I slipped into my bedroom and grabbed a pair of dark wash jeans from my drawer. A small picture fluttered to the ground. I picked it up, purposely avoiding the image as I tucked it away in between my clothing. Thinking of what I had with Abby was too painful. She had been my everything. I would have gladly dedicated my life to her, to our family but she ripped those dreams away. I slammed the drawer closed harder than I intended causing the contents on top to rattle. I ran my hands through my hair and made my way over to the closet, grabbing a blue button up shirt and shrugging it on. I was excited to be getting back to work. Teaching had always been a passion of mine and part of that was due to Abby. She was my high school math teacher when we had met. She kept me focused. I did not realize my dream, however until college, when I took on tutoring others. I did not have to work at all, of course. My father was a prominent director in the movie industry. I liked taking care of myself, and as much as I hated to admit it, it made me feel connected to Abby, even though whatever connection we had been severed some time ago.  
  
  I poured myself a mug of coffee and made my way down the stairs to the first level of my building. It was a warehouse that I had converted into a living space. It was not flashy and overbearing like most of the more expensive houses in the neighborhood, but it gave me the space I needed. A simple apartment would not do for my lifestyle. I jumped into my car and turned it on as I waited for the giant bay doors to rise behind me. My phone rang and I could not help but groan when I saw that it was Angela.  
  
  “Yes?” I called out, not bothering to hide the irritation in my voice.  
  
  “I had an amazing time last night. ” She purred. Of course she did. I fucked her until her she could not stand. I rolled my eyes. She came across as desperate, an extremely unattractive quality in a woman.  
  
  “I know you did. ” I replied, coldly.  
  
  “When will I see you again?” She asked, practically begging. I checked my watch and smiled.  
  
  “Before you know it” I laughed to myself. I had not bothered to tell Angela that I was starting a new job at the school where she worked as a secretary. I had received a call earlier in the week that a teacher by the name of Ms. Gibbs had to take leave for medical reasons. I was hired to take over her class, American Society and Culture. I could hardly wait to see the look on her face.  
  
  “Mmmm…You are such a bad boy. ” She teased. The truth was she had no idea. The things I did with Angela did not even place on the scale of kink. For her it was an awakening, but for me it was a way to pass an afternoon.  
  
  “You have no idea. ” I replied honestly. I drummed my fingers on the steering wheel, as I grew more bored with the conversation. It was not Angela’s fault. No one held my interest in the way that Abby had. My lifestyle was drastically different since I had been with her. It was not until after Abby and I had split for good that I realized who I truly was. I was a dom. I needed absolute control in every aspect of my life. Perhaps Abby was partly to blame for that side of me, but deep down I knew that I was always meant to live this lifestyle.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  I pulled into Kippling College right on time. I did not have a first period class but I wanted a chance to go over Ms. Gibb’s lessons before diving into my own. I said my goodbyes to Angela and made my way into the main building. I could not keep the smug grin off my face when I entered the office. Angela shot to her feet and panic washed over her face. I smiled in her direction, but turned my attention to another woman who was already at the counter. I exchanged words with her, always looking over her shoulder at Angela who looked pale and nervous.  
  
  As I headed towards my room, I heard the door to the office open behind me. The sound of her heels on the floor mirrored that of her frantic heartbeat, I am sure.  
  
  “William?” She called in a loud whisper. I did not stop, did not turn to face her.  
  
  “Good morning Angela. ” I replied as I made my way down the hall. I stopped in front of my classroom to unlock the door.  
  
  “Why didn’t you tell me?” She asked as she followed me inside. “You can’t be here!” She was on her way to a full-blown melt down. I dropped my bag to the floor and spun around to face her. She backed up against the wall, her breath hitched. I stepped closer, my nose nearly touching hers.  
  
  “You do not tell me what to do. I will go and do whatever the fuck I please. Is that understood?” I was clenching my jaw, trying to bite back some of the harsher words that had crossed my mind. I tucked her hair behind her ear and ran my finger over her jaw line. She nodded, in utter shock. She did not expect me to react the way I had. Why should she? As far as she was concerned, we were doing a little role-playing. She had no idea how far into the lifestyle I actually was. I had never taken her upstairs. Never shown her where I really like to play.  
  
  “I-I’m sorry” She sputtered. For a moment, I felt sorry for her. I took a deep breath and ran my hands through my hair.  
  
  “I’m the one who should apologize. It was unfair of me not to warn you. Do you forgive me?” I smiled sheepishly and could practically see her heart melt before my eyes. Her shocked expression shifted into a smile and I knew I had her exactly where I had wanted her. Angela was an open book. She was a liar and a cheater, like all other woman I encountered.  
  
  “Can we get together tonight?” She asked, leaning in towards me, begging me silently to kiss her. I pulled back, turning to retrieve my bag.  
  
  “I’ll let you know. ” I walked over to my desk and did not turn back to see her reaction. I already knew it was disappointment and it was exactly the response I had wanted from her. After a few seconds, the door closed and she was gone. I blew out a deep breath. I needed to find a real sub. Someone who knew better than to talk back to me. Someone who took my word as law and did not question what I did. Every move I made, every word I spoke was deliberate. Unfortunately for Angela, my heart did not factor in to our arrangement. I was cold and uncaring. The thoughts melted away as several students entered the room. I grabbed my notes and prepared for the class.  
  
  The day began relatively smoothly. I was getting back into the hang of things by the time the next period began. The students filed in and made their way into their seats. I sat watching them for a few minutes, twirling a ruler in my hands at they chatted idly about partying. Class should have begun but I gave them and extra moment or two to be seated. As I stood to speak, a lone straggler made her way into the class. She averted my gaze and slipped into her seat at the back of the room. She looked embarrassed and something about that intrigued me. The way her long dark hair framed her face and she innocently bit her lip did other things to me. This one was different. I could tell from the moment our eyes met. She didn’t have an agenda. She wasn’t looking to fuck everyone over for the greater good of herself.  
  
  “Now that we’re all here I’d like to introduce myself. Ms. Gibbs will be out for a few months for medical issues. My name is Mr. Honor. ” I explained. Several of the girls giggled and whispered amongst themselves. I could have any of them I wanted, but I did not want any of them. That was a lie. I glan  
ced back up at the dark haired girl. Her cheeks flushed pink and she quickly looked down at the papers in front of her. Pure submissive perfection.  
  
  I did my best to keep my mind on the task at hand for the rest of the period. When it was finally over, I could not empty out the room fast enough. I wanted to talk to her. I wanted to hear her speak.  
  
  “You, come here for a moment. ” I pointed in her direction. I settled on the edge of my desk as I waited for her to collect her things. I grabbed a ruler and absentmindedly flipped it in my hands. Her eyes watched my fingers intently. If she only knew what I wanted to do with these fingers.  
  
  “Yes?” She asked, her voice barely audible. She was nervous or was she scared? She should be. She should drop this class and never look back if she knows what is good for her.  
  
  “What is your name?” I asked, desperate to hear her speak again. She didn’t respond for a moment and I had to keep from laughing. Did I really scare her that badly? Her face was a deep crimson now. I let my mind wander, thinking how her other cheeks would look that color.  
  
  “Emma. Emma Townsend. ” She replied, her voice shaking. I could not contain my smile any longer.  
  
  “Emma,” Her name tasted sweet on my lips and I wanted to know what it was like to say it under very different circumstances. “Please try to make it to class on time. Lateness will not be tolerated. Next time there will be consequences. ” It was easy slip into my dom position with her. Too easy. I would have to make an extra effort to avoid her. Even as a master of control, I knew that would be too hard to do. I was in no position to be in control of someone so sweet.  
  
  “Yes, Sir” sarcasm bit her words but they still sounded lovely. I wanted to hear her say it again. Wanted to hear her moan those words.  
  
  “Get to class Ms. Townsend. ” Our eyes locked and I pleaded with her silently to leave. I did not know how much longer I could pretend that I wasn’t fantasizing about bending her over this desk. She must have received my message because she turned and left immediately. Perhaps she was just good at taking orders.  
  
  I could not wait for the day to end. My zipper strained just from thinking about Emma. I could hear her voice like a melodic song burned into my thoughts. I grabbed my work and made my way out of the classroom. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out and quickly answered.  
  
  “What?” I immediately regretted answering.  
  
  “How was your first day?” Angela asked, obviously over our spat from earlier in the day. How was my first day? I honestly could not remember anything before it. My thoughts were consumed by Emma. “William?”  
  
  “A breath of fresh air. ” I replied as I exited out of the back door and made my way to my car.  
  
  “Want to celebrate?” She giggled and the sound reminded me of nails on a chalkboard.  
  
  “I’m exhausted. ” I slipped my keys into the ignition and glanced up just in time to see Emma cross the lot. Her shirt was white and hugged the curves of her body. Her shorts left little to the imagination. All I could think about was wrapping those long tan legs around me. Just looking at her made me hard. Not something that happened very often for me.  
  
  “Oh, come on. You don’t have to do any work. ” She was whining. I drank in the last few seconds of Emma before she slipped into her old beat up car before responding.  
  
  “My place. One hour. ” I replied and hung up the phone before she could respond.  
  
  I watched as the cars filed out of the parking lot, making sure to slip in a few cars behind Emma. Her vehicle looked like it could break down any moment. At least that is what I told myself to justify following her home. We made our way to the poorer side of town before she turned down a short driveway to her house. It was small and not very well taken care of. The thought of such a beautiful creature living in such an abysmal dwelling made me nauseous. I stepped on the gas and made my way back to the other side of town. I got my peek into her world. That is all I wanted. I promised myself after seeing where she lived I would keep my distance, but how could I now? Now that I see she deserves so much more? I was obsessing over someone I didn’t even know. No one had made me so crazy since my ex. I shuttered at the thought. This wasn’t the man I was. I do not care for people. I use them until I find someone new. Nothing had changed. Emma is just a distraction. A shiny new toy that I can’t have, so I want her. Fuck, do I ever want her. I made my way back across town to my home. I pulled inside the large garage bay and checked my watch. Angela would be here in twenty minutes. I grabbed my things and made my way to the next floor. Grabbing a bottle from under the island, I quickly poured myself a drink. I ran my hands through my hair and quickly poured another. I light knocking at the door pulled me away from my daydream. I adjusted myself before opening it.  
  
  “Happy to see me?” Angela purred as her eyes danced down my body. She fucking wished. I forced a smile. Emma was something I could never have and I needed to get my mind off her as soon as possible. Even I had enough morals left not to corrupt such an innocent creature. I turned back to the island and downed another quick shot before making my way into my bedroom. I did not have to say a word. I knew she was following behind me like a lost puppy.  
  
  I closed the door behind her and began to undo my belt. She bit her lip and I had to look away. Angela was using me to escape her reality and I was doing the same. I just wanted to feel something, anything. I undid my zipper and sprang free from my boxers. Angela immediately dropped to her knees and began to go to work. Looking down at the top of her head, her mass of blonde waves distracted me and I began to lose my erection.  
  
  “Something wrong?” She asked, looking up at me. I wrapped my fingers in her hair and forced her mouth back onto me. I tried to empty my thoughts and enjoy myself. I pushed her head harder against me and closed my eyes. Flashes of Emma crossed my mind. Her teeth digging into her bottom lip. The lips of an angel. Her long dark hair framing her perfect face. I gripped Angela’s hair tighter in my fist as I grew painfully hard. I pushed her deeper. She didn’t struggle. She opened her throat and let me slide further inside. Taking me all in. As I came, I held still, pressed tightly against her lips as I let out a long deep moan from the back of my throat. I glanced down at Angela who had a single tear streaming down her face but she wore a big proud smile. I buckled my pants and made my way out of the bedroom. Angela quickly followed, her hair in a knotted mess.  
  
  “You want to go out?” She asked as she ran her fingers through her tangled mane. I poured a shot and drank it down quickly.  
  
  “I’ll see you tomorrow. ” I replied coldly as I drank back another. Disappointment clouded the room as she slowly walked to the door and let herself out. I poured another drink and ran my hands through my hair. What the fuck was happening to me? I made my way into the living room with my drink in hand. Settling in on one of the couches, I grabbed my laptop and began searching Emma Townsend. It wasn’t hard to find her. The first social network I had clicked on pulled up a full profile of her, complete with pictures. The sight of her made me immediately grow hard again. I clicked on her bio. She had a small number of friends. A few happy birthday wishes on her page that she had recently responded too. It was her birthday? I thought of her sitting alone. I wondered if she had friends over, if her family was throwing her a party. I wanted to see the happiness on her face. I don’t know if it is the alcohol or my increasingly stalkerish behavior but I was growing nauseous. I drank back my shot and closed my laptop.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  I awoke late on my couch. I got up and quickly grabbed my things. Checking my watch, I knew if I hurried, I could make it to work before Angela. She was the last person I wanted to see. Well, a close second. I took off my button up shirt and made my way into my room to grab a clean one.  
  
  I sped to work, hoping no one would be able to smell the lingering fragrance of alcohol on me. I avoided the office, knowing as soon as Angela spotted me she wouldn’t leave me alone.  
  
  My classroom was empty and I took a moment to straighten myself up and shrug on my shirt. As I turned back towards the door, I could have sworn I saw Emma’s beautiful face staring back at me. As quickly as she appeared, she was gone. I sunk down into my seat and rested my head in my hands. What was it about her? I barely knew her and she had turned my world completely on its axis. I was beginning to feel again and it scared the shit out of me. I was in no position to care about anyone. Especially someone I did not even know.  
  
  The morning drug on and it felt like my first class would never begin. As students began to file into the room I noticed Emma was among them. I had to look away so she wouldn’t see my smirk. Had she taken my warning seriously? Part of me wished she had been late to class so I had an excuse to keep her afterwards. I’m glad she wasn’t. As much as I wanted to be alone with her, I knew it wasn’t the best thing for her. I would allow myself to fantasize but that was as far as it could go.  
  
  “Take your seats. It’s time for a pop quiz. ” The room let out a collective groan. If a quiz was the worst part of their day, they could consider themselves lucky. The truth was I wasn’t sure I could fight off this hangover long enough to teach them anything.  
  
  I sat behind my desk and tried to do anything that would keep my mind off her. It was working for the most part until someone dropped a textbook loudly onto the wooden floor. My eyes immediately met hers. She held my gaze this time, not looking down. She was biting her lip and I was thankful I was sitting down and able to hide my growing wanting for her. I licked my lips and her cheeks burnt pink. I immediately began to shuffle through the papers on my desk. I would have to learn to be in her presence without letting her have this effect on me. I was nothing more than a teacher to her. If she only knew the things I could teach her.  
  
  Time sped back up and the class ended before I knew it. I was careful not to meet her gaze as she dropped off her paper and made her way outside of the room. Fuck. I waited for the halls to clear before heading off to the men’s room. I splashed some cold water on my face and avoided my reflection. I couldn’t get her out of my mind. I grew uncomfortably hard against my zipper. I slipped my hand down the waist of my pants and readjusted myself. The slightest touch caused a shockwave to ripple through my body. I wanted it to be her hand. I wanted to feel her against me. I gripped myself tighter as I throbbed against my fingers.  
  
  The sudden sound of muffled laughter echoed through the walls. I pulled myself from my fantasy and splashed some more water on my face. The laughing grew louder and I realized it was from the adjoining bathroom. I slipped out into the hallway and listened for a moment. The faint smell of marijuana filled the air.  
  
  “Girls” I called out in a commanding tone. The giggling ceased immediately. After a moment of whispering, the door finally opened. I almost fell over as I saw Emma staring back at me. She looked terrified but quickly gave way to another fit of laughter. I don’t know what upset me more, her blatant disregard for herself or the fact that she laughed in my face. I clenched my jaw as I tried desperately not to slip into my dom mentality. “Emma? You think this is funny?” I narrowed my eyes at her and waited for a response. She stopped laughing and shook her head no, throwing herself off balance. I grabbed her arm and pulled her towards my classroom, hoping no one had seen her. Was she trying to ruin her life? “You’re lucky I don’t have a class this period. ” I pulled her inside the room and closed the door, making sure I drew the blind on the window. She sobered up immediately. She looked scared. I didn’t want her to be afraid of me. I needed to calm down. She wasn’t my concern. If she screwed up her entire life that had nothing to do with me. I ran my hands through my hair and took a moment to calm myself. I grabbed my ruler and spun it in my hands, trying to decide where to go from here. She bit her lip as she eyed the ruler nervously. Did she know what I wanted to do with it? “Stop biting your lip. ” I said angrily and slapped the ruler on the desk. She jumped at the loud crack, causing her to bite harder. A thin trail of crimson dotted her pouty lip. Fuck. I had made her hurt herself. She really was scared of me.  
  
  “I’m sorry. ” She said quietly as her fingers touched her lip. She was sorry? I had caused her to hurt herself and she was apologizing to me. I walked towards her slowly, not wanting to alarm her. I needed to be closer to her, to make her feel at ease. I reached my hand up and slowly ran my  
fingers over her bloodied lip.  
  
  “Breathe” I whispered, leaning in closer. She pulled me to her like a magnet and I was not a strong enough man to resist. We stood painfully close to each other, as time seemed to stop in her presence. I couldn’t be sure but I thought she felt it too. Suddenly a loud ringing broke the spell. I dug my phone from my pocket. Angela was calling to make plans for tonight. I could barely hear her over the thudding of my heart in Emma’s presence. I watched her as she watched me. Her cheeks a slight touch of rose as she bit at her lip out of nervous habit. I narrowed my eyes at her and she quickly released it from her teeth. A natural submissive. I grew hard again at the thought. She turned and wandered around the room allowing me a moment of privacy to end my phone call. I let Angela know I wasn’t feeling up to doing anything. Not her at least.  
  
  I walked quietly up behind Emma, who was looking over some posters that hung on the far wall.  
  
  “You should get to your next class. ” I whispered in her ear as I drank in her flowery scent. She did not turn to face me.  
  
  “So, I’m not in trouble?” She asked. If I didn’t know any better, there was disappointment in her voice.  
  
  “I didn’t say that. ” I couldn’t keep from grinning. She breathed deeply and nodded her head.  
  
  “Yes, Sir” She replied as she grabbed her books and made her way back out into the hall. I ran my hands through my hair and laughed at myself. What the fuck was I doing? What the fuck was she doing to me? I slipped my hand inside the waist of my pants and readjusted myself. I knew exactly what she was doing to me. I walked out into the hall to clear my head. Emma stood talking with some friends, no doubt the ones who left her hanging, at the end of the hall.  
  
  “Get to class, Ladies. ” I called out. Her friends quickly scattered but Emma paused to look back at me. Her bright green eyes locked onto mine before she turned to make her way to her next class. I stepped back inside my room. I needed to get a grip on myself before I did something I would regret. She would regret. I swung at a stack of papers on my desk, sending them flying around me. If Emma did like me, she wouldn’t once she found out what kind of man I really was. I was incapable of getting close to anyone. I would use her and when she got too close, I would hurt her. I had done it countless times before to countless women. The difference was those women where no better than me. They lied, they cheated, and the used me as much as I used them. Emma was not like them. She did not deserve to be treated that way and I wasn’t sure it was possible for me to treat her any differently. Even if I could, what would she say when she saw the kind of things I really liked to do? She would be disgusted. I ran my hands through my hair and slammed them down onto the desk. I had gotten close enough, too close in fact. I needed her to know it could never go anywhere. I wasn’t stupid. I had been with my share of woman. I knew what was going on in her mind. She wanted me, but she wanted more of me than I could ever give.  
  
  The next few classes went by painfully slow. As the day ended, I made my way out into the hall, watching as everyone filed by. Then I spotted her and everyone else seemed to fade into the background. Emma was staring directly at me as her friends clung to her side. They were making plans to go out to the movies later that night. Emma agreed to meet them and I shot her a quick smile before slipping back inside my room to grab my things. If she did like me, she wouldn’t after tonight.  
  
  Chapter Four  
  
  I made my way home through the crowd of traffic as ‘Something I Can Never Have’ echoed through the speakers of my car. Once again, I felt alone. Any happiness I had felt the past few days was gone. Emma would never look at me in any way other than a teacher after tonight.  
  
  I made my way upstairs and quickly poured a drink. I drank it down and repeated the ritual a few more times before grabbing my phone and calling Angela.  
  
  “I knew you couldn’t resist me. ” She purred. My stomach turned. I really needed to make time next week to find myself a sub but for tonight Angela would do for what I needed.

1n4hcfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1n4hcfo/first_friendship_breakup_am_i_a_bad_friend/,First friendship breakup - Am I a bad friend?,"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting here so please be kind and patient with the long paragraphs I’m about to type out lol. I (27F) recently went through my first friendship breakup and it’s been extremely hard on me. This is something that I have never been through before, and need help and/or advice navigating through this. For some more info on me, I’m in a healthy relationship with my boyfriend and we live together and have lived together for the past 3 years! I recently started a new job, and live a very quiet healthy lifestyle! 

For some more background context, I am extremely lucky where I grew up with an amazing friend group. My core group of girl friends (there are 9 of us) have been friends since we were in pre-k so over 20 years at this point. Our huge friend group including guys (over 15 of us) has been friends just as long. Obviously as every friend group, there have been minor ups and downs as we have grown up throughout the years but for the most part we have stayed friends and basically drama free and have learned how to keep strong foundational friendships even while not all of us live near eachother anymore. We have the type of friendships where we don’t have to talk or see eachother every single day or week, but we know no matter what we are there for eachother and if we called eachother at 2am we would answer in a heart beat. Some of us live near eachother, while others have moved away. We try and hangout atleast once a month for a girls night, but we all have different work schedules so it’s hard to be consistent. But regardless, we talk in our chat everyday, are there for eachother no matter what, and we don’t measure the strength of the friendship based on how often we see eachother. Because quite frankly, we’re not 21 out of college anymore. We have lives and we all understand life gets busy and we can’t see eachother as often as we used to. We’re grown ups now!! Some of us are engaged, have overnight job schedules, and overall just different lives so we don’t put the pressure on one another to hangout once a week. We see eachother often, like I said we make a priority to hang atleast once a month, but it’s not an every day thing because we understand life is busy. I also know that having a friend group of 9 people for over 20 years is very rare and not a common thing, so I totally understand how lucky I am to have these amazing friends. We’ve made it work and it’s amazing. 

For some additional context, I used to be a huge extrovert in high school and college. I was the girl in the friend group that was always going out, always drinking, always going to bars and clubs. I never said no to a party and was in a very toxic cycle of spending money and drinking and was just a party animal. I went through a really bad break up with my ex (we dated for almost 7 years) about 5 years ago back when I was 23 and afterwards it took me a long time to heal and learn to love again and to find a new boyfriend. Ever since I started dated my current BF, I have completely changed as a person. I rarely drink, rarely go out. I live a very quiet and private life. I don’t like how going out makes me feel. I don’t like clubbing, and don’t love drinking until 3am every night. My body almost rejects alcohol at this point. I’ve done a lot of growing up mentally physically and emotionally. And most of all, I feel extremely healthy and happy! I’ve never felt happier in my life and have really just overwhelmed matured as a person. 

About two years ago, I started working at a company where I instantly became friends with a girl, let’s call her Jen. Jen and I were a part of a team of 10+ people and instantly clicked, becoming extremely close work friends. A lot of the other people on our team weren’t as outgoing or came to work to strictly work and not make friends, so her and I instantly gravitated towards one another as we both had the same mindset of loving having a friend at work (work can suck so having a friend makes it alittle more tolerable). There was another girl on our team, let’s call her Laura, who was very antisocial during our time working at this company together. She barely even looked at us. For the first year I worked there, she maybe said 2 words to me and was very standoffish. She was the type of person who came to work to work and not make friends (which is totally ok). She would leave at 5pm, never go to happy hours, never go to team building activities, nothing. Very quiet, to herself, and in a 10 year relationship. We figured that she was just quiet which was totally okay. We also knew she was in a relationship so we figured she just didn’t like going out and was close with her boyfriend. We never judged her for not wanting to be friends, because we totally understand that as we get older, not everyone wants new friends! So there was 0 judgment ever. 

Fast forward to the last six months of Jen and I working at this company (last summer) Laura started to slowly talk to us here and there and make small efforts to become civil / friendly. It was very random and out of the blue and honestly caught both of us off guard because we thought she hated us. She randomly would start chatting with us, would get coffee with us and eat lunch with us, and we slowly became friends and a friend group of 3. We pretty much welcomed her in with open arms because that’s just the type of people me and Jen are. She started opening up to us that she was having immense problems within her relationship, and had feelings of wanted to end things with her now ex. Jen and I felt bad for her because we realized that the whole reason that she started talking to us and opening up to us was because she probably needed some girl friends, so we were honored that she trusted us and wanted to talk to us, come to us for advice, and felt safe with us. It was really nice getting to know her and calling her a friend, and we wanted to be there for her during this really awful time. It felt really good knowing a quiet girl who we once thought hated us, deep down just probably needed some friends. Laura ended up having an AWFUL break up with her ex, I won’t get into too much details on here but lawyers were involved and it was not a pretty situation. Keep in mind, this is right around the time Jen and I were about to leave the company and us 3 would not be working together anymore( I left first  last July with Jen leaving about 2 months later).

Jen and I were there for Laura throughout the entire situation and dealing with her break up for months. Laura’s family is from a different state so she had no friends or family around here that we knew of, so she had to move back to her families house for a few months. While she was gone, I did everything and anything I possibly could to help her. I last minute helped her move out of her apartment with her ex (she called me and asked me to rush over in the middle of the work day which took almost 3 hours and I missed so much work but I was ok with it). I stored boxes and boxes of her stuff (8 boxes weighing over 50 pounds each) inside my one bedroom apartment for 3 months. I toured over 10 apartments for her, by myself in the middle of work days for weeks and weeks straight while she was out of state. I was on the phone with her almost every night, sometimes until 2-3am just comforting her and giving her advice. I even helped her sign a lease at an apartment close by where my boyfriend and I live, an apartment I toured for her, negotiated for her, and basically did the entire thing for her since she couldn’t herself. I picked her up from the airport multiple times, helped her build new furniture and move into her new place for hours. Honestly you name it I did it. I can go on and on and on about everything I did for her, which I was HAPPY to do. I know what it’s like to leave a toxic relationship and have to start your life over and I wanted to be there for as much as I can, so I had absolutely no problem doing any of this for her and I was extremely happy to help. She was a close friend at this point and I wanted to help out as much as possible.

Fast forward to her moving into her new place (last September), she instantly started asking Jen and I to hangout almost on a daily basis, which at first was completely fine because I figured she was going through some really traumatic stuff and needed some friends. And living so close by now, this was expected. Jen and I loved being there for her and hanging out with her, It was amazing having girl nights the 3 of us and a friend living so close. But a few months later, it started becoming alot for me. She would ask to hangout every single day, multiple times a day. I’m not even kidding, every day. No exaggeration. She would ask to go on walks in the morning, lunch in the afternoon, coffee in the evenings, dinners at night. The next day she would want to get out nails done, go shopping, and then dinner again. It was becoming an everyday thing to the point where I was missing alot of work at my new job and started fighting with my boyfriend because I was never home and always gone with Laura. I also barely saw any of my other friends because all my time was spent with her. I’m also a very quiet person now, I like my alone time, value my alone time, and I like spending time with my partner who I live with. I missed seeing all my home friends and college friends and missed date nights with my boyfriend. 100% of my weeks and weekends were spent with Laura where I was almost mistreating my BF and other friends because I was spending 0 time with them. I also didn’t have the money to do all these crazy things all the time and felt overwhelmed by having to spend money every single day almost on a new event with her. I tried so hard to do as many things as I could because I knew she didn’t have that many friends, but after 3-4 months it started to catch up to me and I felt extremely overwhelmed, stressed, anxious and tired. I also felt myself going back into bad habits of drinking and spending money which didn’t make me feel good. I felt like I was living the lifestyle of a single 23 year old while I was in fact, not a single 23 year old and instead, in a happy healthy relationship living with my boyfriend, which didn’t feel right. It was a very weird feeling. I tried to give Laura grace and just kept telling myself, she’s going through a lot, she needs to be with her friends, she loves hanging out with me. And just tried to be as patient as I possibly could because I knew she was going through a lot and just didn’t want to get mad at her for wanting to see her friends. But it became a lot and almost unhealthy. It was also something I’ve never been through before, I’ve never had a friend want to hangout every single day. Maybe in high school and college when we had no jobs or responsibilities, but over the last few years going into the real world, I’ve never dealt with this with a friend before. 

I also want to note that I’ve been through trauma before, and so have my friends. A few years ago, my dad died in a car accident, my a close friend died by suicide, and I lost two other friends to overdoses, all within 6 months of eachother. I leaned on my friends and family a lot during this time, they got me through the darkest time of my life, but I never once expected my friends to be available all day everyday at every beck and call. I knew it wasn’t realistic and didn’t expect that from anyone. I saw them often, but it wasn’t every day or every week. Bottom line is that everyone goes through shit in life, but we can’t always expect everyone around us to drop everything and everyone in their lives for 6 months straight for us. That’s not reasonable. 

I decided to set some boundaries with Laura. The holidays were coming up and I was getting very busy at work. I had a lot of things coming up with home friends, college friends, family members and my partner. I spoke to Jen and she was feeling the same way that I was, she was very overwhelmed at the entire situation, as she also has a long term partner that she was barely spending time with or her other friends. We both aren’t the type of people to hangout everyday either, Jen and I had a friendship (pre Laura) similar to the friendships I have with my home friends where we don’t need to hangout every single week. so having plans 24/7 was becoming a lot for both of us and something that we were not used to. I decided that I needed to be honest about how I was feeling and set healthy boundaries for the friendship where I was still being a good friend and spending time with her, but also giving myself time to spend time with other people I care about as well. I told Laura that I was getting very busy at work and had a lot of events coming up where I didn’t think that I would be able to hangout every single day like we were. I also told her that I was struggling financially so it was becoming a lot for me to keep up with all the dinners, lunches, shopping sprees and all that. I told her that for the next few months, we should make sure to see eachother every other week and make that a priority. One event would be a girls dinner where we would take turns picking the place. And the other would be where we stay in and host a girls night at one of our apartments and order food and watch a movie. Therefore we always have 2 set dates to hangout each month on the calendar (every other week) and we could do an occasional coffee here and there or a random walk. The point of this was to make sure we ALWAYS have two times a month to hangout, every other week. If some months we hung out more, GREAT! If other months we couldn’t, atleast we got those other 2 nights.  Atleast if we all got busy, we still always had those 2 girls night every month planned. Keep in mind, I don’t even see my other friends (high school or college friends) that often, but I wanted to compromise and continue to be there for Laura. At the same time, I also wanted to make sure I was making time for my family and my partner, who I barely saw for these few months. I felt like twice a month (every other week) was more than fair, realistic and a good starting point for us.

At first, Laura seemed on board with this and was receptive. She seemed like she understood where we were coming from and acknowledged that we were hanging out a lot and even said it’s because she’s bored at work and doesn’t have crazy busy jobs like me and Jen have. For 2 months we did exactly this, two girls nights a month and it was PERFECT. I got to spend time with my friends, my family, have date nights with my partner, save money, and honestly just have some alone time to myself- which as an introvert is MUCH needed, especially when you live with someone in a one bedroom apartment. And I got to have amazing nights with Jen and Laura while also having my space back. It was great because we had more to catch up on and felt more special since we weren’t up eachothers asses anymore. It felt super healthy. But as time went on, Laura started to get angry at Jen and I that we were no longer available every second of every day. She would last minute ask us to do something, whether it was 10am coffee, 2pm walk, 3pm farmers market. I could go on and on. In the middle of a work day while I’m slammed at work and can’t just take off. Because of work and the last minute plans, we weren’t able to do most of these things and we could tell that Laura was slowly started to get angry at us and grow resentment towards the both of us. At first I totally tried to understand her point of view. She’s newly single after being in a 10 year relationship, moved to a new city, started a new job, and was basically starting her life over again from scratch. In the nicest way possible, she was going through a mid life identity crisis. The old quiet Laura who never went out, never did anything, never left the house, turned into party animal Laura, drinking 5 nights a week, wanting to go out EVERY freaking day and just do something every second of everyday. She never wanted to be alone. It was a lot. And me and Jen tried to do as much with her as we could but at the same time, we are at different stages of our lives. WHICH IS TOTALLY OKAY!! We both live with our boyfriends, are in serious steady relationships, have other friends other then eachother, and have family nearby. Like we aren’t the party animals we used to be when we were younger and single. So as much as we tried to do these things with Laura, it became very hard to keep up with her new lifestyle. If we were single girls living by ourselves then I think the situation would be completely different because we would be more available and willingly to do these things. But we aren’t! And that’s ok, it’s okay to be in a different stage of life. The things Laura was going through after ending her 10 year relationship, I went through back when I was 22. 

Laura ended up sending us both a message in a groupchat being very passive aggressive just hinting that we are both never around, don’t put in any effort, and that hanging out 2 times a month was not enough. She made it feel like we were awful people and awful friends for not being available every second of everyday and said some extremely hurtful things to the both of us, basically saying what we were doing wasn’t enough and basically never would be. We both had separate conversations with her afterwards, where I apologized about 100 times for making her feel that way. I would never purposely make anyone feel that way and I felt absolutely terrible. I tried to explain to her that I love her very much and it’s been incredible being her friend, I’ve helped her get through really bad awful times and was there for her for literally everything she went through, but I physically and mentally didn’t have the time to hangout everyday anymore now that summer was over, the holidays were coming up and I was starting a new job. I explained to her how just because we don’t see eachother everyday anymore, doesn’t mean we aren’t still friends and that we can’t measure the strength of the friendship solely off how often we see eachother. I told her how I’ve been friends with my high school friends for 23 years and I see them MAYBE once a month and not once have I ever questioned our friendships or called them bad friends. I never once got mad at them for not being able to hangout every week. And how it’s not fair for her to say we aren’t good friends just because we only hangout once a week or so. Like for gods sake I don’t even see my other friends this often. And I have a life!!! I have a job and other responsibilities. I’m not in the same phase of life as she is. Which is okay. But it’s not fair to not understand that and made me feel fucking awful. Like she made me feel worthless and like a terrible human being. Even my boyfriend said at one point that it seemed like the only thing that would make her happy was if we broke up and I was single and moved in with her. That’s how bad it was lol.

We ended up working through that and trying again, but I slowly realized that nothing was changing and we were going back to the toxic cycle of her getting mad at us for not being available everyday. We did a couple more dinners and girls nights, and then it went back to how it was before where she was asking us to do things nonstop. She wanted to go to Miami, go to LA, go out to fancy expensive dinners, go to the clubs, and honestly just basically act single. Like the list goes on and on. The last time we saw her was in May, where we had a girls dinner at her apartment. She invited two guys she was friends with who were rude and awful and mean individuals. And after that, we all slowly distanced ourselves from eachother and stopped talking. It was a very weird dinner, and Jen and I were very turned off by these two guys. Some of the comments they were making about other people were terrible and we felt uncomfortable being there. Eventually about a month later, Laura unfollowed both Jen and I and we haven’t spoken since. Now she has a new friend group of single girls that she’s with every single day partying and traveling with, a bunch of “influencers” you might say, where they are posting eachother all day, everyday, and it seems like she found her friend group and what she was looking for. she’s out every single day with them spending legit all her time with them, going to the gym, clubs, trips, parties, dinners. Basically a bunch of single girls living their lives, and exactly what she wanted out of me and Jen. I’m truly happy for her that she found her people. I truly am. I just hate how she ended things with me and Jen, she was so fast to drop us. Made no effort in trying to work things out, or see our side of things. It felt like it was her way or the high way, with no compromise at all. And nothing was good enough for her. I’ve had plenty of disagreements with friends growing up, but we always were able to work through it, talk through it, hear eachother out and come to a middle ground. With Laura, none of that. Removed us out of her life without a blink of an eye. We weren’t good enough. Even when we had the first disagreement with her and we apologized a billion times, she wasn’t having it. Her responses were unsympathetic, unkind, and it seemed like she had 0 interested in taking accountability with anything wrong she’s done. 

The whole point of this post is that I really need advice on whether or not I was a bad friend in this situation, because this is something that I have been struggling with so much. I have cried for days and days, and have been so stressed out that I’ve legit triggered cold sores (which I haven’t had since I was a little kid). I’m a huge empath, and I have a huge heart, and I would never want someone to feel this way because of something that I did. Like I mentioned, I’ve never been through anything like this before with previous friendships. I would give the shirts off my back for my friends. And I try so hard to be a good friend as much as I can. 

I did so much for her and genuinely really cared about her, but I have never in my entire life have had a friend be so needy where it felt like I was almost in a relationship with them. I want to say again, that I know she went through a lot, she was definitely going through a mid life identity crisis and I totally understand where she’s coming from, if I went through that I would probably be acting the same way and would just want a group of single girl friends to get my mind off everything. But I’m not going through that, so my priorities in life are different right now. am I wrong for feeling this way? Am I wrong for having a life, a partner, other friends and family and honestly just other priorities? Am I a bad person for not being the same person I was when I was single and 22 and going out drinking every night? Am I wrong for not being available to hangout EVERY. SINGLE . DAY. Am I an awful person for not wanting to drop everyone else in my life for someone I’ve been friends with less than a year? Throughout this entire ordeal I have gone back and started thinking about my home friends. How some of us are in relationships, some are married, some are single. Some live close, some live far. Some have gone through traumatic events, some have not. And I have never ever ever in my life had a friendship like this with ANYONE where I was pressured to be available every freaking day. I was never called a bad person for being busy when life got crazy. I keep telling myself that it’s okay that I’m in a different stage of life than her and it’s okay that I’m not willingly to go out everyday, but man this hurts. Jen is upset but not as upset as me, she’s been through friendship break ups before and keeps telling me that we did everything we possibly could and it would never be enough for Laura. She keeps telling me that not everyone is meant to stay in our lives forever and some people come to teach us lessons and this is one of those times. And she keeps reminding me that we’re good people and good friends but unfortunately, we’re just at two stages in life and while we were willingly to compromise to make it work, Laura was not.

1n4hc4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1n4hc4v/we_should_stop_saying_dont_leave_before_the/,"We should stop saying ""Don't leave before the miracle happens""","# ""Don't leave before the miracle happens"" is one of those phrases that I don't think people think about - at all - when they say it. 

If you're sitting in that meeting with a sponsor, the miracle already happened. You just don't recognize it.

If you are actually willing to take some direction and be part of the fellowship, I think that is nothing less than an act of God. I know it was for me, someone who thought they were smarter and better than everyone even though I had a 10th grade education, no intact relationships, a rapsheet, and a bank account that reflected those facts when I came to AA. 

I really do believe it took a divine intervention for me to be willing to go 1 degree to the right when left to my own devices I would have gone 1 degree to the left. 

Let's talk numbers: 95%+ of alcoholics die drunk. Of the tiny percentage who make it to AA, most never find permanent sobriety. But here you are, sitting in a folding chair drinking terrible coffee instead of drinking yourself to death. That IS the miracle.

I came in at 22, didn't believe or not believe in God, just didn't care about God because I didn't think God, if they existed, cared anything about me. 

My sponsor told me something that made no sense and yet perfect sense at the same time: ""You can still be a disgusting degenerate alcoholic scumbag and be worthy of God's grace, because grace is unearned.""

I said ""That's convenient - so God just randomly saves some drunks and lets others die?""

He said ""Pretty much. If He only gave it to people who deserved it, all the cancer babies would live to 90 and all us drunks would die horrible deaths. That's why it's Grace. You're here. Take the gift.""

Today I don't really believe alcoholics are chosen or anything like that, I really do believe that we get this grace and it's up to us to decide what we do with it. 

The miracle isn't some future white-light experience you're waiting for. It's that your alcoholism somehow drove you through those doors to a place where someone could show you how to live without drinking. Against all statistical probability, you made it here. I was told that a miracle was something that was scientifically impossible to explain. The transformations I've seen and experienced since coming to AA can certainly be nothing but. 

But we tell people to wait for ""the miracle"" like they're not already sitting in it.

Prayer works whether you believe or not. Its purpose is to change the one who prays, not the universe. Once I started asking a God I didn't really believe in for a sign, an opportunity to help others, and for direction, I started to experience things I just can't really explain and that deserve their own post. 

I don't tell newcomers to wait for the miracle. I tell them to look around - they're sitting in it.

Anyone else think we need to retire this saying? ",2,1756601208.0,alcoholicsanonymous,3,0.67,False

  There’s a bloody unwelcome sight.  
  
  Ronan Wolvesey wandered into his usual haunt, The Witch""s Brew, with his twin brother, Raiden, close behind. The rowdy London pub always drew a noisy, unusual crowd: athletic types, businessmen, goth girls…and many of magickind""s unmated. A surprise, considering its owner was pure human.  
  
  It was that very human Ronan now watched, all swinging golden curls and enormous blue eyes, as Kari Keswick leaned over the bar, her brief blue t-shirt exposing a band of soft skin at her midriff. She spoke to another wizard, a big dark-haired one with gray eyes and the look of a predator. Tynan Someone-or-other, he""d been told.  
  
  Fighting a gust of wind, Ronan slammed the little pub""s door. Kari didn""t look his way.  
  
  Instead, she gripped Tynan""s shoulder as she looked into his eyes and smiled softly.  
  
  Bloody hell! He feared this wretched feeling poisoning his blood was the emotion humans called jealousy. He""d rather swallow battery acid.  
  
  “Your eyes will burn holes in her if you stare any harder,” Raiden murmured.  
  
  “He""s been here too often this past month, talking to Kari. ”  
  
  “Why do you care? It""s not as if you""ll spend tonight alone. In fact…” He looked away.  
  
  “I see two splendid possibilities by the window. Come on. ”  
  
  Raiden saw such possibilities every place they went, and rarely was he wrong. Ronan knew he would not spend the night alone…but he fantasized about spending it with Kari. If he approached her now, she would likely refuse him—just as she had for the past two years. Until now, he""d assumed Kari didn""t want to cross that human-wizard line. Given her present company and their coziness, it appeared her refusal was more personal.  
  
  “In a moment. ” Ronan headed for the bar.  
  
  Raiden grabbed his arm. “She""s not for you. Forget her. ”  
  
  Ronan refused to concede defeat. “Shove off. ”  
  
  “She""s hardly the most beautiful female you""ve ever seen. Last week""s blonde was more stunning by half. What was her name?”  
  
  He had no idea, and that was the problem. He grew weary of waking up in a different bed, beside a different body every morning. At just ninety, he was young by magickind""s standards. He couldn""t live this way for another ten minutes, much less eight or nine centuries.  
  
  “There""s something about Kari,” Ronan confessed. “I""ve nearly gone mad trying to discern it. ”  
  
  “The fact she said „no,"" a word you never hear?” Raiden shrugged. “Plenty of other lovelies. Pick one and move on. ”  
  
  As if all women were interchangeable. For Raiden—and the rest of the Wolvesey clan—  
  
  they were.  
  
  “Chat up the girls by the window, then. I want to pop over to the bar, say hello. ”  
  
  Raiden rolled his eyes. “Be quick. Besides, she looks…busy. ”  
  
  At that, Ronan turned back to Kari to find her laying her soft pink lips against the big wizard""s cheek. She looked so delicate and fair against his strong, sun-bronzed jaw. Then Tynan grabbed her hand and squeezed.  
  
  The sight ripped a hole in Ronan""s chest. He clenched his jaw so hard, it was a wonder he didn""t grind his teeth into powder.  
  
  Stalking across the bar, he yanked out a stool near Tynan""s. It screeched across the old stone floor. Still, Kari did not look his way.  
  
  To his left, the heat from the brick hearth flamed to ward off the coming winter""s chill.  
  
  Heavy alternative rock played in the background as some wizards laughed at their attempts to play billiards without magic. Human females at the end of the bar toasted something with stout red wine. Ronan scarcely noticed any of it. As always, Kari drew him in utterly, her smile shining as brightly as her golden hair. Her otherworldly blue eyes seemed to take up half her sweet face. A glance at her bowled him over.  
  
  There was something…fresh about her. Almost pure. If he could figure it out exactly, maybe he could rid himself of this odd obsession.  
  
  “Kari?” he called.  
  
  She blinked several times, then tore her gaze from Tynan""s. The other wizard released her, giving her permission to greet him. Was she bedding the wanker? In love with him? The thought screamed across his brain like a battle cry.  
  
  “Ronan. ” She sidled down to his end of the bar. “A scotch?”  
  
  “Double, no rocks. ” He glanced down at Tynan. “New…friend?”  
  
  “I see your brother has already made yours for the night. ” She looked just over his shoulder at his brother with a sarcastic twist of her pretty pink lips. “I hope you""re in the mood for a brunette tonight. It appears she""s yours by default. Raiden always takes the redheads. ” Then she looked at her watch and whistled. “Quick work. That""s a record, even for him. ”  
  
  Ronan grimaced. He didn""t like coming here to find women, but his twin insisted nowhere else was more expedient or target-rich.  
  
  “I don""t care who Raiden""s found. He can have them both. I came for you,” he confessed.  
  
  Kari reached behind her for a glass on the shelf. “We""ve been over this. I won""t spend the night with you. ”  
  
  “Why? It""s not because I""m a wizard. ” He glanced at Tynan. “Clearly. ”  
  
  “Don""t ask me again. Please. ” She slammed the glass on the well-worn bar between them.  
  
  Ronan grabbed her hands. They were soft and fragile, and at a mere touch, desire burned him alive, eating at his composure. “You""re like a fever to me. I need to touch you. ”  
  
  “That line work for you often?”  
  
  Kari thought the admission he""d had to choke out was a ploy? He scowled. “It""s not a bloody line. ”  
  
  She shook her head, blonde curls brushing breasts he""d dreamed about touching, and extracted her hands. “Like any fever, you""ll recover from it. ” Kari then withdrew a bottle of scotch, filled the glass, then shoved it his way. “Six pounds. ”  
  
  With a sigh, Ronan shoved his money across the bar. “I simply want to talk to you. ”  
  
  “No, you want to shag me. And then forget me as you have every woman you""ve ever met here and shagged for the past two years. The notches on your bedpost are long, as is the line.  
  
  I have neither the time nor inclination. ”  
  
  With that, she turned away and headed to the other end of the bar.  
  
  Bugger!  
  
  Raiden motioned him over, and Ronan went, pasting on a smile. He glanced at the brunette. Pretty enough. Nice mouth. Small hands. Maybe he could close his eyes and pretend she was Kari. It would hardly be the first time. But now that he knew wizards weren""t off limits, he vowed someday—soon—that he would have Kari for a night.  
  
  With the slam of the door, Ronan and his date for the night were gone. Kari bit her lip, steeling herself against the pain of the all-too familiar sight. Still, it hurt more each time he left with another stranger, knowing he""d be holding her while she tossed in bed alone, wanting what she would never have: his devotion forever. “Who is he?”  
  
  Kari looked over to her newest regular, Tynan O""Shea. Polite, quiet—for now. A brewing storm, for certain. He was obviously haunted by the loss of the woman he""d loved. She didn""t know much about magical politics or villains. In fact, as a human, she shouldn""t know about magickind at all. Indiscreet wand waving after too much liquor had changed that a few months ago. But this Mathias D""Arc creep who had killed Tynan""s lady love sounded right scary. And if Kari could do anything to help him find happiness again, even if it was merely listening to how much he missed his beloved Auropha, she would do it.  
  
  She shrugged, trying to appear unaffected. “A regular who thinks he can crook his finger and I""ll shag him. ”  
  
  Tynan paused. “Has he ever kissed you?”  
  
  “No. ” Not that Ronan hadn""t tried. Not that Kari hadn""t thought about his full mouth on h  
ers, demanding as her fingers gripping his long midnight hair. Or her palms skimming his five o""clock shadow while his green eyes devoured her…  
  
  “Hmm. Ever…been with a wizard?”  
  
  That question gave her pause. “Not that I know of. ”  
  
  “If you""d slept with one, you""d know. ”  
  
  “Really? You look like human men. Prettier perhaps, but I assumed the anatomy worked the same. ”  
  
  “Yes and no. ”  
  
  “That""s it? That""s all you""re going to tell me?”  
  
  Tynan sighed. “Everything I""m about to tell you must remain secret. We cannot let word of our existence spread. ”  
  
  Not that she""d reveal their existence anyway…or that anyone would believe her. They""d all think she was raving mad if she tried. “Of course. ”  
  
  “Wizards are much like human males, except we have more…” He cleared his throat.  
  
  “Stamina. ”  
  
  Oh! The thought of shagging Ronan all night long made her flush everywhere. She hadn""t bothered with sex since discovering that her fiancé Edward had a revolving door to his bed.  
  
  Despite Ronan having the same habit, something about him made Kari remember all the reasons celibacy sucked. And Tynan""s words were only making her flush with need. “I see. ”  
  
  His voice dropped another octave. “We also have extra senses. ”  
  
  Fascinating. “Such as?”  
  
  Tynan leaned closer. “Wizards sense their lifelong mates by taste. We know very quickly if a woman is ours. ”  
  
  “Taste?”  
  
  “A deep sharing of mouths, kissing away a tear…sampling a woman""s arousal, any will tell us if she""s destined for us. Making love to her only cements the belief. ”  
  
  He was joking, right? Capitalizing on the fact she knew little about wizards. “Are you suggesting that Ronan could kiss me and determine I was his…”  
  
  “Mate. Yes. ”  
  
  “Like a wife?”  
  
  Tynan hesitated. “Deeper. More permanent. ”  
  
  His smile had vanished, and the tight ache in Kari""s stomach told her he was quite serious. “What happens if a wizard mates with a woman?”  
  
  “Happens? Well, he Calls to her. That is to say, he speaks ritual words offering a vow to her. If she wishes to accept, she Binds to him by speaking ritual words in return. Once they""re mated, if she""s human, she assumes a magical lifespan equal to her mate""s, at most a thousand years. ”  
  
  Kari gulped. A whole millennium? “Incredible… But what I meant was, if a wizard mates, does he…love her?”  
  
  “Always. Forever. ” His answer was quick and absolute.  
  
  “Auropha was your—”  
  
  “Yes. ” He looked down at his hands. “Or would have been once she""d grown up a bit.  
  
  Another three or four years, and I would have Called to her. ”  
  
  When his face tightened with grief, Kari felt instantly contrite. “How many years had you been waiting for her?”  
  
  He flashed her a sad smile full of memories and regrets. “Twenty. ”  
  
  The poor man. He""d loved her deeply and long, and never had the opportunity to make her his. “I""ve said it before, but I really am so sorry. Is it possible for you to find another mate?”  
  
  Tynan hesitated. “Not im possible, but unlikely. ”  
  
  If he had belonged to Auropha in his heart, did that mean…? “Can a mated wizard find another woman, then decide to mate with her instead?”  
  
  “In rare instances, usually when the mating was motivated by something other than instinct and love, a wizard may meet another who is his true mate. But if he has that instinct when he enters into the mate bond, then he is hers forever. ”  
  
  “He can""t…cheat?”  
  
  At that, Tynan""s face broke out in a smile, and Kari was amazed at the way it transformed him. His stark, handsome face turned downright dishy. Too bad for her that she had eyes only for Ronan.  
  
  “Impossible,” he assured.  
  
  Kari nearly signed with relief, then caught herself. Ronan had never kissed her, and given the hundreds—maybe thousands—of women he had, if he hadn""t yet found his mate, he was unlikely to press his lips to hers and suddenly decide she was “the one. ”  
  
  “Lovely to know, but pointless. Ronan merely wants to make me one in his long list of conquests. ”  
  
  “I wouldn""t be too certain of that. ”  
  
  Her heart nearly stopped. “Why not?”  
  
  “I overheard him. Bits, mind you, but he favored you over another perfectly acceptable female. ”  
  
  “Because I""ve said „no"" each time he""s tried to seduce me. ”  
  
  “I might have agreed, except he said you were like a fever to him. ”  
  
  “Lust. ” She shrugged.  
  
  “Perhaps, but a wizard can sometimes sense his mate even before he tastes her. A fever is a good description. ”  
  
  “That wasn""t a line of crap?” Kari""s heart beat double-time, and she gripped the bar to steady herself. Was there any chance Ronan might be interested in her beyond making her one of his many lovers? 

“Not at all. I remember my fever for Auropha well. ” Depositing a few bills on the bar, Tynan stood. “Good night. ”  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  Sunlight blasted Ronan""s eyes like a two-ton bomb. Slinging his arm over his eyes, he licked his lips. Had his tongue grown fur overnight? He stretched, his hair pinned under his shoulders, and encountered another warm body.  
  
  Peering over with one eye open, he stared. Dark hair tangled across a woman""s narrow shoulders. She possessed a smooth, bare back, small waist, great backside. Ronan didn""t recall her name. In fact, he didn""t recall much of last night beyond the half bottle of scotch he had consumed. And insisting the woman beside him dim the lights so he could close his eyes and pretend he held Kari in his bed.  
  
  This morning, he had no illusions. He""d never seen this bedroom, and the brunette was nothing like Kari. Nor had fantasizing that he made love to her assuaged his ache. Lately, he""d repeated this pattern nearly every night. Different woman, different bed. Still, his need grew.  
  
  There had to be more to life than aimless shagging with strangers. What was the point of living centuries if all they had in store were empty embraces and quiet misery?  
  
  Sitting up, Ronan scrubbed his hands across his face. He had to leave. Now. Where the hell were his clothes?  
  
  Ignoring the pounding in his head, he slid his legs off the edge of the bed and stood, the cold November morning nipping at his bare skin. He studied the floor and found yesterday""s garments discarded among the woman""s. Her bra tangled in his socks, her knickers atop his shirt.  
  
  Bloody hell.  
  
  “Going somewhere?” asked a woman in a smoky voice.  
  
  Wincing, he cursed under his breath, then smoothed out his features and turned to her.  
  
  She had lovely brown eyes with thick lashes, flushed cheeks, swollen lips. Abrasions from his stubble chafed her jaw, breasts and abdomen. He""d done that. While thinking of another woman.  
  
  It wasn""t fair to her. Or to him.  
  
  Ronan couldn""t look at her anymore. He turned away.  
  
  Truthfully, he had nothing against whatever her name was. She""d provided a distraction last night, and in turn, he hoped he""d provided her pleasure. Now, he wanted only a drama-free farewell.  
  
  “I""m afraid I""m a bit busy this morning. Running late, in fact. ” He began grabbing his clothes and yanking them on. He""d love to use his magic…but Raiden had chosen two very human ladies last night. A wave of his hand, followed by a suddenly perfectly-dressed form might induce some screaming and require explanations.  
  
  As if sensing his withdrawal, the woman grabbed the sheet and covered everything below the neck. A relief, really. Not that she wasn""t gorgeous, but Ronan couldn""t deny his disinterest in the harsh light of day.  
  
  “Coffee?” she offered.  
  
  He""d love some, but… “No thanks. I""ll pop home. Don""t want to trouble you. Do you happen to know where my brother might be?”  
  
  “With Lily. Two doors down, corner unit. ”  
  
  Splendid. With Raiden elsewhere, he could leave this lady""s flat and teleport home without any sort of speech from his twin. What he""d do then… No idea. A part of him wanted to drown his sorrows in more scotch, but drinking before eight in the morning seemed a bit much, even for a Wolvesey.  
  
  He finished donning his clothes and sent her an awkward wave. “Right. Good bye, then. ”  
  
  “Before you go…”  
  
  Ronan winced again. Pray God she wasn""t going to ask him to fix some bit of plumbing for her, or worse, climb back into bed.  
  
  “Yes?”  
  
  “I don""t think we should see each other again. ”  
  
  Hmm. He should probably care that she""d insulted his masculinity or his prowess or some such. But he felt only relief.  
  
  “Agreed. ”  
  
  He left without another word, jogging down the hall, bypassing Lily""s flat, where his brother was presumably sleeping. Or busy. Raiden was a grown wizard who knew his way home.  
  
  The sooner Ronan left this place, the better.  
  
  He all but jumped down the stairs. Once in the building""s empty lobby, he hid in a dark corner, picturing the manor he shared just outside London with all the wizards in his family.  
  
  Then he dissipated from the spot, with an inconvenient trip to Nauseashire when his stomach revolted, before materializing back home.  
  
  A shower. And coffee. Damn and blast, impossible to have both at once.  
  
  Torn, he headed first for the kitchen. And unfortunately found his father.  
  
  “Early morning or late night?” his elder asked.  
  
  “Both. ”  
  
  His father laughed, revealing a row of white teeth, short dark hair lightly peppered with gray, and laugh lines around his green eyes. At nearly seven hundred, Nathanial Wolvesey looked barely forty in human terms.  
  
  “Me, too,” Nathanial confided.  
  
  Looking at his sire was like looking into Ronan""s own future. Same build, same features, same eyes. Same life of excess, alcohol, and one-night stands.  
  
  “You""re frowning, son. Wake up beside an ugly one?”  
  
  No. Quite the opposite. But he hadn""t woken up beside Kari. Such a sentiment would incite a great deal of laughter in this house. But he wasn""t certain he could hold it in. His fever for Kari kept raging, and he needed answers. His father was, unfortunately, the best place to start.  
  
  “Are you quite certain our family is cursed?”  
  
  His father paused, set down his steaming mug, and stared. “You doubt it?”  
  
  “Has any of us ever truly tried to find a mate?”  
  
  Nathanial recoiled. “Good Lord, why would you want to?”  
  
  “I don""t know that I do. ” Liar.  
  
  “Without the instinct, we could taste a million women and never know if one was our mate. That curse is to blame. So why risk a life of abject unhappiness?”  
  
  Because he was already unhappy.  
  
  “If it""s children you want, be patient. You know from me, your uncles, and brothers, it""s possible. Conceiving them merely requires a great deal of diligent effort. ” His father smiled him and winked as if that fact pleased him greatly. Knowing the elder Wolvesey, it did.  
  
  “In fact,” his father continued, “Raiden informed me yesterday that a little witch he met last month is expecting. His first. Right proud, he was. So you see…”  
  
  His twin was having a youngling with a witch he barely knew and might never see again.  
  
  And he was proud? The thought made Ronan queasy.  
  
  “Remind me how the curse began. ” Maybe if he heard the story again, he might discern some way to escape it and learn to sense his mate.  
  
  Nathanial shrugged. “My great-grandfather married a Councilman""s daughter. Ugly thing, but powerful family. He had no instinct for her, but such are political matches among magickind, eh? Not long after, he met a beautiful human. He burned for her quite badly, but confessed to her that he was…what""s the human word, married? The human cried. He kissed away her tears and discovered she was destined to be his. When he tried to break his bond with his current mate, the witch wailed and screamed and cursed the family—she swore no Wolvesey mating would ever last. My great-grandfather paid her no heed, broke his bond with the witch, and mated the human. She delivered him a healthy son, but died shortly thereafter. As have all Wolvesey mates since. We""re not fit for one woman, son. ”  
  
  So Ronan had heard before—over and over. “When was the last time a Wolvesey mated?”  
  
  His father stroked his chin with a frown. “It was your great-uncle Martin, I think. He mated this tall, exotic witch. I was a lad, but I recall her beauty. Shortly after their pairing, a freak accident separated her body from her head. ”  
  
  His great-uncle Martin. Since Ronan had never met the wizard, he assumed that was hundreds of years ago. “But no one has tried since?”  
  
  “Of course not. ” His father peered with concern and drifted closer. “Our mates all die, and the wizards are miserable for centuries. Are you daft enough to think of taking a mate?”r />  
  “That is exactly what I want to know. ”  
  
  Ronan jumped at the challenging boom of a voice. Raiden had arrived. Damn.  
  
  Turning to his twin, Ronan couldn""t think of a single thing to say. He knew better than to ask his brother whether he was tired of shagging a different woman every night. Ronan would lay money that Raiden was living his dream.  
  
  Ronan and his twin were nearly identical, except Raiden had a golden mane of hair to his dark. But their ideas and attitudes diverged more each day.  
  
  “Just asking a few questions about the family curse. ” He tried not to wince.  
  
  Raiden raised a golden brow. “For the same reason you screamed Kari""s name last night when you shagged Sophia. ”  
  
  So that was the brunette""s name… wait. Screamed Kari""s name while having sex with Sophia? “Shit. ”  
  
  “Oh, yes. Just after you dashed away, Sophia, all full of tears, visited her best friend Lily.  
  
  You cheated me out of a very promising morning. I had to assure her that you were far too inebriated to remember your own name, much less hers. Both friends decided we""re womanizing prats, so there ends my association with Lily. ”  
  
  Ronan refrained from pointing out that Raiden almost never spent the night with the same woman twice. His twin wouldn""t welcome the observation just now.  
  
  “Congratulations on the impending birth of your first youngling. ” Ronan quickly changed the subject.  
  
  Unfortunately, Raiden wasn""t diverted. “You""ve changed. Since our transition into magic, we""ve frequented pubs and sampled many ladies. We""ve never failed to secure a night with the lovelies we most wanted because we work well as a team…until recently. Last night, I had to work damn hard to talk both Lily and Sophia into coming with us because you were too busy mooning over Kari. It""s making my evenings more difficult. It""s crap, and it""s going to stop. ”  
  
  Didn""t his brother think he""d tried to stop the constant thoughts of a woman he couldn""t have, who wanted little do with him? In truth, Raiden had probably never thought of this from any point of view but his own. Until the past few years, Raiden""s perspective had been his own.  
  
  The more Ronan talked to Kari, the more that changed.  
  
  “Son,” Nathanial interjected. “I hope you know better than to mate. It""s no state for a Wolvesey. ”  
  
  Especially if it meant Kari""s death. In his head, Ronan knew that. He should walk away, refuse to return to The Witch""s Brew, never set eyes on her again.  
  
  But Ronan couldn""t do that, not until he knew for certain the curse wasn""t crap. Kari was a fever in his blood that he simply couldn""t cure—at least not until he had her. Perhaps if he took her to bed once, he could purge his need for her, as he had every other woman.  
  
  Ronan had no other option.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  Sunday night at The Witch""s Brew. Always quieter than any other day of the week, but the wintery snow on top of the slush of the last storm had made roads unbearable.  
  
  A few customers sat in dark corners of the pub. Tynan had come and gone for the evening, and she hoped he was all right. His Auropha had died a month ago today, and his grief was still so raw. The usual collection of rowdy wizards remained in the back with their billiard sticks and ales. A smattering of men and women collected around the room, some magical, some not. She didn""t always know the difference.  
  
  And she watched the door. Nearly ten o""clock, minutes until closing. Kari sighed. Ronan wasn""t coming. Likely, he already had a woman for the night and was pleasing her with those large hands, that sinful mouth… She shouldn""t care. After Edward, she""d given up men, particularly gorgeous ones with one thing on their mind.  
  
  Too bad she couldn""t seem to forget Ronan.  
  
  Suddenly, the bell chimed and the door swept open, bringing a dusting of snow on a pair of combat boots. Long legs in black trousers, a heavy charcoal duster, long hair the color of midnight, piercing green eyes that saw right to the heart of her desire.  
  
  Ronan. And he was alone.  
  
  He shut the door behind him, never looking away as he strode to the bar, shedding the duster in favor of a crisp white shirt beneath that revealed a sinuous roll of muscle with every move.  
  
  God, he was a beautiful man.  
  
  Kari swallowed. “Scotch?”  
  
  “Double, no rocks. ”  
  
  Quickly, she poured his drink, then set it in front of him. Before she could move away, he grabbed her wrist. “Kari, I came to talk to you. ”  
  
  And she knew exactly the subject he wanted to discuss. If she had sex with him, he would only find someone else to grace his bed tomorrow, and she would crumble.  
  
  Over the past two years, she""d come to know Ronan slowly. At first as a laughing flirt with a quick wit and an even quicker mind. He""d chatted, told jokes, and made her feel beautiful at a glance. She""d begun fantasizing about him. Discovering he was a wizard hadn""t deterred her.  
  
  But seeing him leave with other women, night after night, had taken its toll on her heart.  
  
  Her desire only deepened when he""d started taking time during each visit to talk to her.

At the end of the day I'm open to anything and everything, but the main goal is always to find someone for the long haul. Anything from a concert or movie pal, to a confidant pillar of support and someone who can help through all the bumps in life.

I'm a young professional type, stable both financially and professionally. Emotionally open, physically in shape, I don't have any vices beyond caffeine, and no drama outside of a needy cat. 

I have a wide variety of interests and usually can find common ground with anyone. Especially in terms of music, food, and films. I'm also very into learning languages. I tend to prefer someone who is also physically fit, doesn't take themselves too seriously, and is maybe so stable they think they're boring, and without kids. I'm open to any form of personal style as well, just express yourself and be yourself. I tend to be spontaneous and like to show my brand of care in the form of acts of service and words of affirmation. I have a very secure attachment style as well.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Braga vs. Rio Ave FC: A Clash of Unstoppable Force and Immovable Object (With More Goals Than a Tax Audit)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Liga Portugal Betclic showdown that’s as predictable as a Portuguese man’s love for *bica* coffee—yet somehow still thrilling. On Sunday, **SC Braga** (1.71 implied probability of victory) will visit **Rio Ave FC** (4.6 implied probability of victory) in a match that’s less of a contest and more of a math problem. Let’s break it down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a meme.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Braga’s Odds Smell Like a 5-1 Win

Braga’s current form is the soccer equivalent of a toddler with a crayon: *unstoppable and leaving chaos in its wake*. They’ve gone 15 games unbeaten, including a 9-1 aggregate thrashing in the Europa League playoff that makes you wonder if they accidentally invited the Lincoln Red Imps to a practice session. Their 12 wins and 3 draws in all competitions this season? That’s a win rate of 80%—or, as we call it in betting circles, “the kind of consistency that makes your bookie cry into their espresso.”

Rio Ave, meanwhile, is the team equivalent of a “meh” emoji. While they’ve managed 18 wins, 13 draws, and 7 losses this season, their 38-game record hides a critical flaw: they’re facing a Braga side that’s scored first in **eight straight matches**. The “First to Score” prop is Braga’s version of a starter pistol—only with more *fogo* (Portuguese for “fire,” but also what happens when you challenge their striker).

The odds tell the story: Braga is priced at **1.71** (implied 58.8% chance to win), Rio Ave at **4.6** (21.3%), and the draw at **3.85** (26%). That’s not a match—it’s a **mathematical inevitability** with a side of drama.

### News Digest: Injuries, Roster News, and a Coach’s Quote That Could Use a Translator

Braga’s only blemish? They’re missing **Ricardo Horta** and **Carlos Vicens**, two players who could’ve single-handedly won this game by juggling the ball on their knees. But hey, soccer’s like a group project—someone else will just have to do the work. Their r

There was this guy, we'll call him Tom, in his early 20's, also at the same program and year as me. I just casually noticed him for almost a year but we never talked, I barely registered his existence. 

Then, I needed help and asked him something about the uni portal after a class one day as class ended. We kept talking and he seemed nice enough. Then he asked me if I was going to eat lunch at the cafeteria, so I went with him. Again, this was just two acquaintances talking. I told him I had a train to catch in two hours or so as I lived a bit away and Tom told me he'd accompany me and if I wanted to drink something first. I said sure and he took a bit of a romantic (?) detour to a park. Then we got coffee and it kept feeling more and more like a date by the way he was talking and smiling but I didn't think to much of it.

After this, Tom kept texting me. I had given him my number at the cafe for uni stuff. He kept wanting to meet up and come to my city and I avoided making concrete plans. Eventually we did hang out near my house about a week or two later. We went to a bar and a restaurant and he kept sitting near me/flirting with me despite me not reciprocating at all. No, I didn't consider this a date at all, it was nothing friends wouldn't go out to do together. 

After this he again, kept texting me. This man texts me, I tell him I'm busy with \[x\], he texts me the day that is supposed to be over to meet up, rinse and repeat. It has gotten to the point that I put off texting him back for days thinking maybe he'll get the hint but he doesn't. I don't want to outright say anything because he hasn't done/said anything explicitly romantic and I have a feeling he'll deny/get mad? as he tends to be pushy in normal conversation. He keeps amping up the flirting as I try to ignore it in his texts but at this point I don't know what to do? I don't think I was being unfair to him but at this point I'm not sure. I couldn't just block him either, the new semester is starting and I'm going to see him often for literal years. Again, if he was aggressive/scary I could think of ways of reporting him or something but this isn't that either.",1,1756600493.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,1.0,False

Life is like climbing a mountain - there are ups, downs, and plenty of people we meet along the way. But here's something most of us forget in our rush to reach the top: **the same people we pass on our way up might be the very ones we encounter on our way down**.

## Why Your Behavior Today Shapes Your Tomorrow 🔄

Think about your career journey, personal relationships, or any goal you're pursuing. Every interaction you have is like planting a seed. You can choose to plant flowers or thorns - and trust me, you'll encounter your garden again someday.

### The Workplace Reality Check 💼

Remember that colleague you dismissed when you got promoted? Or the assistant you barely acknowledged when you became a manager? Here's the thing - industries are smaller than they appear, and people have long memories. That ""junior"" person you ignored today might be your boss tomorrow, or worse, the decision-maker when you need a reference or a new opportunity.

**Practical tip**: Treat everyone with the same respect you'd want for yourself. Learn names, say thank you, and acknowledge people's contributions regardless of their position.

## The Social Circle Phenomenon 👥

We've all seen it happen - someone gets a little success and suddenly becomes too busy for old friends. They network upward but forget their roots. But life has a funny way of humbling us all eventually.

### When Success Becomes Temporary 📉

Jobs end. Businesses fail. Relationships change. Health issues arise. Financial situations shift. The very people you thought were ""beneath"" you during your peak might be the ones offering support during your valleys.

**Action step**: Keep your inner circle strong. Check in with friends regularly, not just when you need something. Celebrate their wins and be present during their struggles.

## The Networking Mistake Everyone Makes 🤝

Most people network horizontally (with peers) and upward (with superiors) but ignore downward networking (with juniors, newcomers, or those in different fields). This is a massive oversight.

### Why Downward Networking Matters

- Today's intern could be tomorrow's CEO
- People from different backgrounds bring fresh perspectives
- Word-of-mouth travels in all directions
- Genuine relationships aren't about hierarchies

**Try this**: Mentor someone junior to you. Share knowledge freely. You'll be surprised how much you learn in return and how these relationships can benefit you unexpectedly.

## The Character Test 🎭

Success doesn't build character - it reveals it. How you treat people when you have power shows who you really are. And here's the uncomfortable truth: people talk. Your reputation follows you everywhere.

### Building a Reputation That Lasts

- **Be consistent**: Treat everyone well, regardless of what they can do for you
- **Stay humble**: Remember that circumstances change quickly
- **Show gratitude**: Acknowledge those who helped you climb
- **Remain accessible**: Don't let success make you unapproachable

## The Practical Daily Approach 📅

Here's how to implement this wisdom in your everyday life:

**Morning mindset**: Start each day remembering that everyone you meet is fighting battles you know nothing about. Choose kindness.

**Professional interactions**: 
- Thank the security guard who greets you
- Acknowledge the cleaning staff
- Be patient with customer service representatives
- Offer genuine compliments to coworkers

**Personal relationships**:
- Return calls and messages promptly
- Remember important events in friends' lives
- Offer help without being asked
- Listen more than you speak

## The Long-Term Investment Strategy 💰

Think of good relationships as your ultimate insurance policy. Unlike material possessions that can be lost, the goodwill you create lasts. People remember how you made them feel long after they forget what you said or did.

### Creating Your Personal Legacy

Every day, you're writing your story through your actions. Ask yourself:
- Will people remember me fondly?
- Did I lift others up or just focus on myself?
- Am I building bridges or burning them?

## The Universal Law of Returns ⚖️

What goes around truly comes around. This isn't mystical thinking - it's practical reality. Treat people poorly, and eventually, it catches up with you. Treat people well, and doors open in unexpected ways.

### Real-World Examples

- The waiter you're rude to might serve your important business dinner next month
- The neighbor you ignore might be on the hiring committee for your dream job
- The classmate you helped might become your business partner
- The junior employee you mentored might recommend you for a leadership role

## Making It a Habit 🔄

Good behavior toward others should be automatic, not strategic. Here are ways to make it natural:

1. **Practice empathy daily**: Try to understand others' perspectives
2. **Give credit generously**: Share success with those who helped
3. **Apologize when wrong**: It shows strength, not weakness
4. **Celebrate others**: Be genuinely happy for people's achievements
5. **Stay connected**: Regular check-ins show you care beyond your own needs

## The Future-Proof Approach 🚀

This principle isn't just about immediate career benefits or social advantages. It's about creating a life where you can look back with pride, knowing you treated people with dignity and respect regardless of their status.

In a world that often rewards cutthroat behavior, choosing kindness and respect makes you stand out. It creates lasting relationships, opens unexpected opportunities, and most importantly, helps you sleep better at night.

## Your Next Steps Forward ➡️

Starting today:
- Send a thank-you message to someone who helped you recently
- Reconnect with an old friend or colleague
- Practice active listening in your next conversation
- Offer help to someone without expecting anything in return

Remember, the mountain of success isn't just about reaching the peak - it's about how you treat fellow climbers along the way. And since we all face different seasons in life, the relationships you nurture today become the safety net that catches you tomorrow.

The choice is yours: plant flowers or thorns. But remember - you'll walk through this garden again. 🌺

1n4h3eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n4h3eb/static_man/,Static Man,"Hey everyone. I don’t know where else to put this. I’m typing this on my phone under my desk at work because I’m too scared to go home. I need to know if anyone else has experienced this, or if I’m just losing my mind.

It started about three weeks ago. Small things. I’d come home from work and my apartment would smell like ozone, like right after a thunderstorm. But the weather had been clear. I’d find a single, dead lightbulb on my bathroom floor, even though I hadn’t touched the fixture in months. I wrote it off. Weird coincidence. Old building shit.

Then the sounds started.

I live alone. Have for years. But two nights ago, I was watching TV and I heard a voice from my bedroom. It was muffled, like someone talking through a wall. I muted the TV, heart hammering. It was my voice. It was saying, “I’m just taking out the trash, be right back.”

I’d said that exact sentence to my ex-girlfriend over a year ago, the last time she was over. I remember it because we’d had a fight about me being lazy and I was trying to be proactive.

I grabbed a baseball bat and cleared my entire apartment. Nothing. The windows were locked. The door was bolted. I was completely alone.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Yesterday was worse. I came home and my key didn’t work. I jiggled it, thinking it was just sticky, but then I heard the deadbolt slide open from the inside. I froze. The door swung inward.

And I saw myself.

It was me, standing in my own hallway, wearing the same shirt and jeans I had on. But its eyes were wrong. They were dark, like two holes punched in paper. Its smile was too wide, stretching in a way that looked painful.

“You’re home early,” it said, and its voice was almost mine. Almost. There was a static hiss underneath it, like a radio tuned between stations.

I stumbled back, falling on my ass in the hallway. I just stared, my brain refusing to process what I was seeing. The thing—the me-thing—just stood there, smiling that impossible smile.

“I made coffee,” it said. “You look like you need it.”

Then it closed the door. I heard the deadbolt slide back into place.

I sat there for maybe ten minutes, just shaking. I could smell coffee. The rich, dark roast blend I buy from the place down the street. It was wafting under my door.

I got the hell out of there. I called in sick to work today and I’ve been holed up in a shitty motel on the edge of town. But I had to go back this morning. I needed clothes. My laptop. My cat, Mr. Whiskers.

I waited until the sun was fully up. I approached my apartment door like it was wired with explosives. My key worked this time. The door opened normally.

The apartment was… almost spotless. Cleaner than I’ve ever kept it. There was no smell of ozone. No dead lightbulbs.

But things were off.

My bookshelf was organized by color instead of author. I hate that. I’m a author guy, always have been. The photo of my parents on the mantel was replaced with a framed picture of a bowl of fruit. My coffee maker was unplugged and cold.

And Mr. Whiskers… he was hiding under the couch. He wouldn’t come out. When I finally managed to grab him, he freaked out. Hissed, scratched my arm to ribbons, and bolted back into hiding. He’s never done that. He’s the friendliest cat. He sleeps on my face.

That’s when I saw the note on the fridge. Held up by a magnet I’ve never seen before—a little ceramic owl.

The handwriting was mine. I mean, it was a perfect copy. But the message…

“Went to the store. Back soon. Remember to water the plant.”

I don’t have a plant.

I looked where the note said I should. On the windowsill in the living room, there was a small, terracotta pot with a single, sickly-looking green shoot in it. The soil was wet.

I grabbed my go-bag (I’d packed one after the door incident), my laptop, and tried to coax Mr. Whiskers again. No luck. I had to leave him. I’m a terrible person. I just couldn’t stay in there another second.

I’m at work now. I can’t focus. Every time someone walks past my cubicle, I jump. A few minutes ago, Sarah from accounting stopped by to ask about the quarterly report. Her voice sounded… fuzzy for a second. Like it was overlayed with static. And I swear her smile was a little too wide when she turned to leave.

I keep checking my phone. My security app shows a camera feed from my living room. I installed it after a break-in a while back. The feed is live right now.

It shows me. Or it. Sitting on my couch, petting Mr. Whiskers, who is purring and rubbing against its leg. It’s watching my TV. It’s wearing my favorite hoodie.

It just looked up. Right at the camera. It waved.

It knows I’m watching.

The feed just cut to static.

What do I do? It’s in my house. It’s living my life better than I ever did. It has my cat. It has my handwriting.

I’m scared it’s going to come to my job. I’m scared to look up and see it standing in the doorway to the office, smiling that static smile, telling everyone it’s me and that I’m the impostor.

I’m scared to go home.

But most of all, I’m scared that it’s right. Maybe it is better at being me. Maybe no one will even notice I’m gone.

Edit (5 minutes later):

Oh god. I just got a text from my mom. It’s a picture of her and… me. They’re at lunch. She wrote: “So great to see you sweetie! Thanks for the surprise visit :)”

The thing in the picture is wearing the clothes I wore yesterday. It has its arm around her. Its smile is perfect. Normal.

But its eyes.

Its eyes are still dark.",3,1756600472.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Life has become a giant scorecard, hasn't it? We've turned into a society that's absolutely fascinated with putting numbers on everything that should probably be felt with the heart instead of calculated with a calculator.

## When Beauty Became a Color Chart 🎨

Walk into any store today, and you'll find foundation shades numbered from 1 to 50, skincare products promising to lighten or darken, and an entire industry built around the idea that beauty comes in specific, measurable tones. We've created a world where people apologize for their natural appearance and spend fortunes trying to fit into boxes labeled ""acceptable.""

But here's the thing - when you watch a sunset, do you pull out a color wheel to decide if it's beautiful? When you see someone laugh genuinely, do you check their skin tone before deciding whether to smile back? 

**Daily Reality Check**: Next time you catch yourself judging someone's appearance, pause and ask yourself what you actually noticed first - was it really their looks, or was it how they made you feel?

## The Report Card Prison 📊

Remember when learning was about curiosity? Now we've turned education into a points-per-hour system where a single number supposedly captures someone's entire intellectual worth. Students stress over decimals while losing sleep, and parents compare children like they're comparing car mileage.

We've forgotten that Einstein struggled with traditional academics, that many successful people were considered ""average"" students, and that creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence don't show up on transcripts.

**Try This Today**: Instead of asking a student ""What did you get on your test?"", try ""What's the most interesting thing you learned this week?"" Watch how their face lights up differently.

## The Bank Balance Respect Meter 💰

Here's where things get really weird - we've started measuring human worth by checking account balances. People work jobs they hate to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't even like. We've created a culture where your address determines your value, where people lie about their income, and where kindness gets overlooked if it doesn't come with a luxury car.

Think about it: the teacher who shapes young minds earns less than someone selling sugary drinks. The nurse saving lives makes less than someone moving numbers around on a computer screen. We've mixed up contribution with compensation.

**Reality Shift**: Start noticing how often you make assumptions about people based on their material possessions. That person in the old car might be debt-free by choice, while the one with the fancy watch might be drowning in payments.

## The Liberation Plan: Taking Back What Really Matters 🚀

### For Beauty Standards 💫
Stop using filters that change your natural features. Compliment people on their actions, not their appearance. Celebrate the diversity you see around you instead of trying to make everyone fit one mold.

### For Education Obsession 📚
Value learning over grades. Ask questions that don't have right or wrong answers. Celebrate effort and improvement, not just final scores. Remember that wisdom and intelligence show up in countless ways that no test can measure.

### For Money Madness 💡
Define wealth by your experiences, relationships, and peace of mind - not just your bank statement. Stop letting price tags determine your self-worth. Choose careers that align with your values, not just your desired lifestyle.

## Building Tomorrow's Perspective 🌱

Imagine explaining our current system to someone from the future: ""Well, we used to think people were more valuable if their skin was certain colors, if they could memorize information better than others, and if they accumulated more stuff than their neighbors.""

They'd probably wonder how we got so confused about what makes humans valuable.

## The Practical Revolution Starts With You 🔥

**This Week's Challenge**:
- Give genuine compliments based on character, not appearance
- Ask someone about their interests, not their achievements  
- Notice when you're judging based on external markers
- Practice seeing people as complete humans, not walking report cards

**This Month's Mission**:
- Stop participating in comparison culture on social media
- Support businesses and people based on their values and quality
- Have conversations that go deeper than surface-level status symbols

**This Year's Transformation**:
- Build relationships based on authenticity, not social positioning
- Make decisions based on personal fulfillment, not external validation
- Create environments where people feel valued for who they are, not what they have or how they look

## The Bottom Line 🎯

We're living in an era where we've confused measurement with meaning. But the most important things in life - love, creativity, wisdom, kindness, courage - can't be quantified, categorized, or compared.

The real revolution happens when we stop playing the numbers game and start seeing people as the complex, valuable humans they actually are. It happens when we choose depth over data, character over color, and wisdom over wealth.

Your worth isn't determined by any scale, scorecard, or salary. You're valuable simply because you exist, contribute, and care. That's not measurable - and that's exactly what makes it so powerful.

The future belongs to those brave enough to see beyond the superficial sorting systems we've created. Will you be one of them?

---

**Remember**: Every interaction is a chance to see someone's true value. Every conversation is an opportunity to go deeper than the surface. Every day is a fresh start to measure what really matters - and it's not what you think.

Maci  
 AMBER SLAPPED A hand over her mouth and had to work at swallowing her coffee before she burst out laughing. “Oh, I would have paid to have been there! Stupid night shifts at the hospital getting in my way of all the fun stuff. ”  
You should’ve seen the look on Shelby’s face when Bryce pulled me in for a long kiss in front of her. ” I grinned against my cup and drained the rest of it. “It really was priceless.   
“I would have even suffered through being near Bryce if it meant watching that skank get put in her place. ”  
 I rolled my eyes. Amber had never been one to hide her hate for Bryce, and even though I’d never understood why she didn’t like him in the first place, it was becoming more of a running joke for us rather than her actually hating him. Besides, she couldn’t hate him: he’d inadvertently brought us together a couple years ago and we’d been best friends since.  
  
  It had been my twenty-first birthday, and somehow over the course of the night filled with barhopping and Bryce being . . . well, Bryce, he’d ended up with a concussion and we’d spent the rest of my birthday in the ER. Amber had been one of his main nurses when we’d finally gotten him into a room, and not more than twenty minutes later, my night filled with drinking and not much food decided to make a reappearance all over my shoes. In my still-drunk mind, I hadn’t even been upset about puking everywhere. I’d started crying because my favorite shoes were ruined and “favorite shoes can’t be ruined on my birthday. ” Amber and another nurse had cleaned everything while I sat there crying like a three-year-old over my shoes, and when they were done, a pair of sequined Uggs were placed in front of me. Amber had told me at the time they were her favorites and I could borrow them so I could finish out my birthday wearing a pair of “favorites. ” It’d been a lasting insta-friendship, even though she still wouldn’t let me live that night down.  
  
  She groaned and tossed her phone roughly onto the table. “I swear this guy is a machine. He never stops. I mean, never. If it weren’t for the fact that we have jobs, I don’t think he’d ever let me leave the bed. ”  
  
  “Is this still Aaron? You said you two still sneak into the closets at the hospital . . . ” I drifted off, my accusation sounding more like a question.  
  
  “Yeah, exactly. Machine. Let’s just hope we’re busy tonight, I need at least a twelve-hour break from that man before we go back to one of our apartments, or he’s going to break me. ”  
  
  I shook my head sadly at her and almost chickened out of asking my question twice before finally blurting, “Do you actually enjoy having sex?”  
  
  “Is that a trick question? Of course I do, who doesn’t?”  
  
  “I just—I don’t know. In the books I read, these women have amazing partners and I know what I’m reading is fantasy . . . I mean, seriously, I get that. But I don’t enjoy sex with Bryce at all. It has nothing to do with wishing it was like what I read, it’s just really, really bad. ”  
  
  Amber eyed me with a confused look. “Then why are you still seeing him? Maci, you’re hot, it’s not like you wouldn’t have a chance with anyone else. You don’t have to settle for him. ”  
  
  “I’m not. He’s not even my boyfriend, you can’t settle for someone you aren’t technically dating. ”  
  
  “Exactly! But you’re still not getting out there either because he’s always with you and stops anyone from coming near you. ”  
  
  I sighed and twirled my empty coffee cup between my fingers. “I know. ”  
  
  “You just need to drop him. And since you two only have this friends-with-benefits thing going on, it shouldn’t be a big deal to end it. ”  
  
  “We’re not together because my brothers would flip if they knew I was dating anyone. ”  
  
  “No, you just think your brothers would flip,” Amber argued. “There’s a difference. ”  
  
  My jaw dropped and I looked at her like she was delusional. “Max Bertrand asked me on a date right before college started and canceled via text the day of. I saw him the next day and he turned and literally ran the other way, Amber. He had tape on his nose and huge bruises under his eyes!”  
  
  She shrugged. “Maybe he didn’t want you to see him looking like that. ”  
  
  “He still runs away from me, you’ve seen him do it! Besides, my brothers fessed up to it. ”  
  
  “Huh”—she looked like she was trying to find something to support her argument before finally throwing her hands up in the air—“okay, fine. They’re a little protective. ”  
  
  “Or a lot protective. ” I rolled my eyes and snorted. “Anyway, Bryce knows all that and is completely fine with staying how we are. Eh, well, for now. ”  
  
  I knew Bryce figured we would be a legitimate couple eventually, but he was expecting me to change in that time; and there wasn’t a chance in hell of that happening. I was positive the only reason he was okay staying “just friends” for now is because he and I both knew his family wouldn’t approve of the way I looked. I didn’t fit in with their perfect country-club multimillion-dollar house, and I was more than okay with that. I had grown up in a loving home, and my mom always encouraged each of us to find who we are and be that person.  
  
  And that person wasn’t a back-to-her-blonde-roots, polo-wearing, club-for-brunch-on-Sunday kind of girl. It’s not like I was goth or grunge, or even some peace-pushing, tree-hugging hippy. I was just Maci. I’d dyed my hair a vibrant red years ago and never gone back. My nose was pierced with a small hoop in it, I have a few tattoos, and I cussed too much from growing up with older brothers—something that Bryce was always reminding me he hated—if that was enough of a reason for Bryce to keep me hidden from his family, then so be it. It just helped with the arrangement I needed in hiding him from my brothers.  
  
  “Tell me something,” Amber said suddenly. “What don’t you like about sex with Bryce?”  
  
  “The whole thing?” Amber’s expression deadpanned, and after looking around to make sure we were alone outside the café, I sat up straight. “Okay, fine. Well, first, he seriously lasts forever but however he’s doing it doesn’t feel good. Like, it’s almost painful. Second, I’ve never had an orgasm with him. Ever. I always have to finish myself when I go home or after he leaves. And, third, there’s never any foreplay—it almost seems like a business transaction. Take your clothes off, let him thrust for a while put your clothes back on and part ways. It’s the most awkward part of our relationship . . . friendship, gah, whatever-the-fuck it’s called. ”  
  
  Amber was cracking up by now, and though she was covering her mouth to try to quiet it, her entire body was shaking and her face was turning red.  
  
  “Why are you laughing, this isn’t funny!”  
  
  “Seriously. ” She snorted and her laughs got louder. “Oh my God, I’m sorry. Whew!” She fanned at her watering eyes. “Oh that just makes me hate him more. And to think, Shelby can’t stand you because you’re ‘with’ Bryce Anderson? If only she knew . . . if only she knew. ”  
  
  I dropped my head into my hands and groaned. “I want a guy who pays attention to me for once. It doesn’t have to be this amazing, mind-blowing, the-world-stops-turning experience; I just want to enjoy it. Just once. That’s all I want. ”  
  
  “Nope, I’m not letting you settle for anything less than your . . . whatever-the-hell experience you just said. We need to find a man who will give that to you. ”  
  
  “Sure . . . yeah. Not even counting the fact that guy is probably only found in fiction; that would involve me sleeping with numerous guys until I find one who will give me that experience. Not only do I not want to be labeled a slut like some best friends I know . . . ” I cleared my throat and gave her a pointed look. “But that also sounds like the biggest headache. ”  
\>  
  “I won’t take offense to that because I love you, but we’ve got to get you away from Bryce. ” She took a long drink from her cup and slapped her hand down on the table a few times. “Oh! Oh, what about your neighbor! That cop guy—”  
  
  “Detective. ”  
  
  “Same difference. He’s all quiet, and intense, and . . . mmm. I bet he’d be good. ”  
  
  I bet he would be too. I’d had the biggest crush on him since I was twelve and he’d starred in practically every fantasy I’d ever had. “Yeah, that’s not about to happen. ”  
  
  “Why not? Is he married?”  
  
  “Uh, no, he’s not. But he’s Dylan and Dakota’s best friend. They all grew up together. ”  
  
  Amber’s eyes glazed over, and a grin I knew too well crossed her face. “God your brothers are—wait! How did I not know he was their friend? Where have I been?”  
  
  “Not allowed near my brothers . . . ?”  
  
  “Yeah, but he’s your neighbor! I didn’t know you actually knew him. And you can’t hide them from me forever. They’re the only two of your brothers left who are available, and they’re identical twins. It’s every girl’s fantasy. ”  
  
  “And this is where I throw up. Or pour bleach on my brain. Anything to forget you talking about fantasies and Dumb and Dumber in the same hour, let alone sentence. ”  
  
  She snorted and rolled her eyes. “You have to admit your brothers are good-looking. ”  
  
  I made a gagging noise the same moment my phone went off. Reaching for it on the table, I saw Bryce’s name and showed Amber. “Speak of the devil. ”  
  
  “Let me guess, he’s lonely?” I made some sort of affirmative noise and she grabbed her purse as she stood to leave. “Tell him your vagina is no longer available. We’re officially starting our manhunt for Mister Awesome, and he can’t be in the running. ”  
  
  “God, Amber, you’re ridiculous. We’re not starting anything and I’m not going to end . . . whatever it is I have going on with Bryce right now. ” My lips pursed when I read his message. Bryce A: Hey babe can I come over? Long day at work need to unwind  
  
  “He’s in the way of you finding anyone else,” she argued.  
  
  “I don’t want to find anyone else. ”  
  
  Her eyes narrowed and she pointed at my cell. “I’m finding you someone else. Anyone would be better than him. I’m going to come over tomorrow with the first guy that shows up in the ER tonight just to prove my point. ”  
  
  I laughed and shook my head. “Have fun at your shift. ”  
  
  “We still on for getting our apartments all Christmas-ed out this weekend?”  
  
  “How is that even a question? Of course. ”  
  
  “Just making sure! I’m going to have to warn Aaron my body won’t be available for an entire day. ”  
  
  “That poor guy,” I said in a monotone voice. “How will he ever live?”  
  
  She laughed and blew me a kiss. “Later, sweetie!”  
  
  Looking back at my phone, I tapped out a response as I stood and headed to my car.  
  
  Sure. I’m on my way back, come over in 30?  
  
  Despite the complaints I’d just shared about him, I really liked Bryce. We’d been close like this for a while now, and good friends for years before. He could be sweet when he wanted to, and was protective almost to a fault when it came to me. I needed to stay “single” to protect guys from my four older brothers, but it still felt good to have a constant in my life, and to be wanted by someone.  
  
  Connor  
  
  “WAIT, YOU’RE LEAVING?”  
  
  My arms froze with the shirt partially over my head, and when they started moving again, my movements were careful as I finished pulling the shirt over my chest. With a deep breath in, I turned to look at the pissed-off girl. “That’s how this works, sweetheart. ”  
  
  She pulled the sheet up on her chest as she used her other arm to sit up. “Then tell me what your definition of this is, because apparently it’s different from mine. ”  
  
  Letting my hand slide to the back of my neck, I left it there as I shrugged. “I picked you up at a bar. I’d met you not even an hour before we left; I don’t know what else you could expect from that. ”  
  
  “Yeah, you’re right,” she scoffed. Her face scrunched together in anger, but even in the dark room I could see the wetness gathering in her eyes. “What else would I expect from some prick who picks up women in a fucking bar?”  
  
  I focused on her eyes a moment longer, willing myself to feel something for making her cry. Regardless of not remembering her name, it should bother me to see a woman cry—especially if I’d been the reason behind those tears.  
  
  But there was nothing.  
  
  There’d been nothing since I’d returned from my trip to Texas six months ago. Just countless, nameless women who never filled a void that shouldn’t have even been there. Turning around, I slapped my hand over my phone and wallet resting on the chair, and walked toward the hall.  
  
  “For the record, douche, it’s called a one-night stand. One. Night! Not one hour,” her voice broke as she continued to scream insults as I left her apartment.  
  
  As soon as I was in my car, I pulled up the texts on my phone and tapped out the same message I did every night.  
  
  I need to know you’re okay Cassidy. Please call.  
  
  My thumb hovered over the SEND button for a few seconds before going up and hitting CANCEL instead. I dropped the phone into one of the cup holders and scrubbed my hands down my face before cranking the engine and starting home.  
  
  She’d briefly come back into my life more than six months ago, and was only there for a little more than a week. But that week had fucking wrecked me.  
  
  My partner and I had gotten the call six months ago about a house fire that looked suspicious—and later ended up revealing the bodies of Cassidy’s mom and stepdad—early that morning. And when Cassidy had shown up hours later, I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I don’t know if it’d been the obvious black eye she had, or if somehow, even during all the craziness of interviewing neighbors, I’d known that I recognized her—but she was all I could see that day. Days later, when I remembered her from a family-disturbance call I’d gone on years before, the completely innocent girl started haunting my every thought.  
  
  She was on my mind constantly. Knowing I’d made the wrong decision in not following up on that call killed me more than I’d ever be able to explain. With my past, and what my father had done to my sister and me, I hated knowing I’d let her live through years of abuse. And then she walked into the coffee shop that morning, and everything changed.  
  
  I hadn’t been big on relationships before officially meeting Cassidy—for shit’s sake, I was only twenty-five years old and had been career focused most my life. I’d had girls, and claimed a few as mine for a while, but something about actually settling down had always scared the living hell out of me. Not with Cassidy, though. With her, I would have done anything to make her stay in California with me instead of going back to her boyfriend in Texas.  
  
  It wasn’t just that she had a past like mine . . . that she knew what it was like to grow up being physically abused by a parent. It wasn’t just that she would understand my fears of turning into my father. And it wasn’t just the fact that she was the strongest person I’d ever met, emotionally—and in a way, physically. It was all of that, added to something that was just Cassidy. Something that the small and deceivingly fragile-looking girl exuded from deep down that drew me to her. That within minutes had me ready to make her the center of my world.  
  
  When she’d left for Texas, I went out of my mind worrying about her with her boyfriend. He’d been the cause of her black eye, and no matter what she’d said about it being an accident as she tried to break up a fight, I couldn’t get the sight of her sporting it out of my head. I’d gone after her, intent on bringing her back with me, and positive I’d find her looking much like she had when she’d come to California the morning of the fire. What I hadn’t been ready for was her telling me to leave, or how she’d relaxed into him when he came near her, like he was a safe place for her.  
  
  But I hadn’t stopped worrying about her, and no matter how many girls there were, and how many nights I’d tried to wash away thoughts of her with drinks . . . she was always there. Her honey-colored eyes and soft smile still haunted me, and it was a daily battle to not contact her even though I was dying to know she was okay.  
  
  I pulled into my spot and slowly made my way up to my apartment. I’d been so lost in my thoughts of a girl over a thousand miles away, I didn’t notice the one right in front of me until her voice filled the otherwise silent hall.  
  
  “Hey there, super-mysterious neighbor. You’ve been gone a lot lately. ”  
  
  “Maci,” I grunted by way of acknowledgment.  
  
  “Where’ve you been?”  
  
  “Is that your business?”  
  
  “Wait, wait! Don’t tell me. ” She stopped trying to unlock her door, raised one dark eyebrow, and pointed at me. “I can smell you from here . . . was her name Sweetheart? Or maybe it was Sweetheart. ”  
  
  “Hilarious,” I said without emotion.  
  
  “Well I thought it was. ”  
  
  I rolled my eyes and walked past her to my door. “Good night, Maci. ”  
  
  “Yeah, whatever. Good seeing you too, Connor,” she mumbled to herself as she went back to her door. “Don’t ask how I’ve been, it’s cool. Asshole. ”  
  
  “Maci. ”  
  
  “Yes, douchebag?”  
  
  My eyes narrowed and I watched as she fought her smile. “You think you can try keeping it down tonight?”  
  
  Her smile instantly fell and her head jerked back as confusion settled over her face.  
  
  “I’m tired of being kept awake from your headboard hitting the wall. ” When her gray eyes flashed, I unlocked my door and glanced at her again. “And you really need to work at faking it. You sound pathetic even from my bed. ”  
  
  “You are such an asshole, Connor Green!”  
  
   
; “So you’ve said. ” I stepped into my apartment and locked the door behind me seconds before I heard her door slam.  
  
  Heading back to my bedroom, I stripped out of my clothes and went straight into the bathroom for a hot shower. The girl I’d gone home with tonight had taken a bath in her perfume, and I could feel it seeping into my skin, causing a headache to form that had nothing to do with what I’d drunk earlier. Pressing my hands against the wall, I dropped my head and let the water pour over me as the tightened muscles in my body started relaxing. As soon as I reached behind me for the shampoo, the water turned ice cold and I jumped away from the spray, slipping in the process and barely catching myself on the edge of the tub before hitting the bottom. I scrambled to get out of the shower and when I continued to slip, grabbed the handle and shut the water off instead.  
  
  On the other side of the thin wall, I heard the water running, and loudly cursed Maci when I heard the distinct sound of her laughter filling her bathroom.  
  
  I slapped my hand on the wall connecting our apartments and shouted, “You sure you want to play this game, sweetheart?”  
  
  More laughs came from her side before I heard, “Hope you didn’t bust your ass too hard!”  
  
  “Turn the damn water off, Maci!”  
  
  “Enjoy your night,” she said in a singsong voice and then there was nothing but the running water from her shower.  
  
  Payback is about to be one hell of a bitch, Maci Price.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Maci  
  
  TURNING THE WATER on in my shower, I waited for a good five minutes before stepping in, afraid that Connor would give me the same treatment I’d given him the night before. When I didn’t hear movement from his bathroom, I jumped in and stayed tense as I washed my hair and body, ready to get out at a moment’s notice if his water kicked on. When nothing had happened by the time I started shaving my legs, my body relaxed and I wondered again what was going on with him.  
  
  The Connor I’d grown up with was completely different from the one who had been hiding out next door for the last half year. He’d never been a very outgoing guy, but he also wouldn’t have let that prank last night go. Amber nailed it when she called him quiet and intense yesterday. Connor exuded this intensity that was somehow demanding and still managed to make you feel safe near him, which was probably why he had been such a good police officer, and now detective. But Connor’s way of dealing with most things was silently. The most I’d ever heard him talk was when he was with my brothers, but even then he was still the quiet and mature one. Almost like he’d lived a dozen lifetimes before and was simply going through the motions of this one.

*Transform workplace tension into productive collaboration with these proven strategies* ☕

## The Reality Check: We All Know ""That Person"" 🎭

Every workplace, family gathering, or friend group has one: the person who responds to every suggestion with an eye roll, every optimistic comment with a cynical quip, and every new initiative with ""Yeah, right, like that'll work."" They're not necessarily mean-spirited, but their default setting seems permanently stuck on ""doubt everything.""

Sound familiar? You're not alone in navigating these choppy interpersonal waters.

## Understanding the Skeptical Mind 🧠

Before diving into solutions, let's decode what's really happening here. People who default to sarcasm and cynicism often share common traits:

**Past Disappointments**: They've likely experienced broken promises, failed projects, or unmet expectations. Their skepticism becomes armor against future letdowns.

**High Standards**: Paradoxically, many cynics are perfectionists who've become frustrated with mediocrity. Their criticism stems from wanting things to be better.

**Fear of Vulnerability**: Expressing genuine enthusiasm feels risky. Sarcasm provides emotional distance and protection.

**Intelligence Signaling**: Some use cynicism to demonstrate their analytical thinking or superior judgment.

Understanding these motivations doesn't excuse difficult behavior, but it provides a roadmap for more effective interactions.

## The Foundation: Emotional Regulation First 🎯

Your initial response sets the tone for everything that follows. Here's your mental preparation checklist:

**Stay Calm**: Their negativity isn't personal, even when it feels that way. Take three deep breaths before responding.

**Avoid Defensive Reactions**: Defending your ideas against sarcasm often escalates the situation. Instead, acknowledge their perspective first.

**Set Internal Boundaries**: Decide in advance how much negativity you'll absorb before stepping away from the conversation.

**Remember Your Goals**: Focus on what you want to accomplish rather than winning the argument.

## Strategy One: The Acknowledgment Approach 🤝

When faced with sarcastic pushback, try this sequence:

1. **Validate Their Concern**: ""I hear that you're skeptical about this timeline.""
2. **Ask for Specifics**: ""What particular aspects worry you most?""
3. **Find Common Ground**: ""We both want this project to succeed.""
4. **Redirect Constructively**: ""Given your concerns, how would you modify the approach?""

This method transforms their criticism from obstacle into input.

## Strategy Two: The Practical Pivot 🔄

Cynics often respond better to concrete details than abstract concepts. Instead of saying ""This will revolutionize our workflow,"" try ""This tool could save us 30 minutes per day on data entry.""

**Use Specific Examples**: Replace vague benefits with measurable outcomes.
**Share Similar Success Stories**: ""Company X reduced their processing time by 40% using this method.""
**Acknowledge Limitations**: ""This won't solve everything, but it addresses our biggest bottleneck.""
**Invite Testing**: ""Let's try it for two weeks and measure the results.""

## Strategy Three: The Collaborative Convert 🤔

Transform the skeptic into a quality control partner:

**Leverage Their Critical Eye**: ""You're good at spotting problems. Could you review this plan for potential issues?""
**Make Them the Expert**: ""Given your experience with similar situations, what would you recommend?""
**Create Shared Ownership**: ""If you were designing this process, what would you do differently?""
**Value Their Input**: ""Your questions always make our final product stronger.""

## Daily Application Techniques 📅

**Monday Morning Meetings**: Start with realistic assessments rather than overly optimistic projections. Cynics appreciate honesty about challenges.

**Project Presentations**: Include potential obstacles and mitigation strategies upfront. This shows you've thought critically about the proposal.

**Casual Conversations**: When they make sarcastic comments, respond with genuine curiosity rather than irritation. ""That's an interesting perspective. Tell me more about why you see it that way.""

**Email Communications**: Use data and facts rather than emotional appeals. Instead of ""This exciting opportunity will transform our team,"" write ""This change could increase efficiency by 25% based on pilot program results.""

## Setting Boundaries Without Building Walls 🚧

Sometimes accommodation isn't enough. Here's how to establish limits while maintaining relationships:

**Use the Broken Record Technique**: Repeat your main point calmly without getting drawn into arguments.
**Set Time Limits**: ""I can discuss concerns for ten minutes, then we need to move forward.""
**Redirect Energy**: ""I understand you have reservations. Let's focus on solutions.""
**Know When to Walk Away**: ""It seems we have different perspectives on this. Let's revisit it later.""

## The Long-Term Relationship Investment 💡

Building trust with skeptical personalities requires consistent actions over time:

**Follow Through Religiously**: If you say you'll do something, do it exactly when promised.
**Admit Mistakes Quickly**: When things go wrong, acknowledge it before they point it out.
**Share Credit Generously**: When successes happen, highlight their contributions to the outcome.
**Respect Their Expertise**: Find areas where their knowledge genuinely exceeds yours and defer to their judgment.

## Advanced Techniques: Reading Between the Lines 🔍

Experienced skeptics often communicate valuable information through their criticism:

**""That'll never work"" might mean**: ""I see three major obstacles you haven't considered.""
**""We tried that before"" might mean**: ""Here's what went wrong last time and what we learned.""
**""Sure, whatever"" might mean**: ""I don't feel heard or valued in this decision.""
**""Good luck with that"" might mean**: ""I'm not confident in the resources or support available.""

Learning to decode these messages transforms friction into useful feedback.

## Team Dynamics: Making It Work for Everyone 👥

When managing groups that include skeptical members:

**Assign Roles That Fit**: Make them the risk assessor or quality control reviewer.
**Balance Perspectives**: Pair optimists with realists for more comprehensive planning.
**Create Safe Spaces**: Allow time for concerns to be voiced without judgment.
**Focus on Outcomes**: Measure results rather than debating approaches endlessly.

## Communication Styles That Actually Work 💬

**Use ""What if"" scenarios**: ""What if we encounter resistance from other departments? How would you handle that?""
**Ask for their worst-case thinking**: ""If this goes badly, what would that look like?""
**Provide options**: ""Here are three approaches. Which one seems most viable to you?""
**Give them control over details**: ""You choose the implementation timeline that makes sense.""

## When Nothing Seems to Work 🤷

Some people remain difficult despite your best efforts. In these situations:

**Document interactions**: Keep records of agreements and commitments.
**Seek support**: Talk to supervisors, HR, or trusted colleagues about patterns you're observing.
**Protect your energy**: Limit exposure when possible and practice self-care strategies.
**Focus on what you can control**: Your responses, your work quality, and your professional relationships with others.

## The Surprising Benefits 🌟

Working effectively with skeptical people often yields unexpected advantages:

**Better Decision Making**: Their questions force you to think more thoroughly about proposals.
**Improved Planning**: Their worst-case scenarios help you prepare for actual problems.
**Stronger Final Products**: Their criticism, when constructive, eliminates weak points in your work.
**Personal Growth**: Learning to handle difficult personalities builds confidence and communication skills.

## Creating Positive Change Over Time 🌱

Change happens gradually with skeptical personalities. Look for these progress indicators:

**They start asking questions instead of making statements**
**Their criticism becomes more specific and actionable**
**They occasionally acknowledge when something works well**
**They begin contributing solutions alongside problems**
**They show up consistently and engage with the process**

## Real-World Application Examples 🏢

**In Family Settings**: When your skeptical relative dismisses your career change, ask ""What specific concerns do you have about this transition?"" Then address each concern with concrete information.

**During Team Projects**: When the cynic says ""This timeline is unrealistic,"" respond with ""Help me understand which parts seem problematic. Let's build a more workable schedule together.""

**In Social Situations**: When they sarcastically comment on your enthusiasm, try ""I can see you're not as excited about this as I am. What would make it more interesting for you?""

## The Patience Paradox ⏰

Here's the counterintuitive truth: the faster you try to change a skeptical person, the more they'll resist. Patience isn't just kind—it's strategic. Small, consistent interactions build trust more effectively than dramatic gestures or heated confrontations.

Think of it as compound interest for relationships. Each positive interaction adds to an account that eventually pays dividends in improved cooperation and reduced friction.

## Maintaining Your Own Positivity 🌈

Working with perpetually negative people can drain your energy and optimism. Protect yourself by:

**Surrounding yourself with supportive colleagues when possible**
**Remembering that their negativity reflects their experience, not your worth**
**Practicing gratitude for the lessons learned through these challenging interactions**

## The Universal Truth 🌍

Every human being wants to feel heard, valued, and respected. Skeptical people express these needs differently, but the underlying desires remain the same. When you approach them with genuine curiosity rather than frustration, you create space for more authentic communication.

This doesn't mean accepting disrespectful behavior or endless negativity. It means recognizing that underneath the sarcasm often lies someone who cares deeply about outcomes and has learned to protect themselves through emotional distance.

## Moving Forward Together 🚀

The goal isn't to transform cynics into cheerleaders overnight. Instead, aim for mutual respect, productive collaboration, and reduced friction in your shared environments. Success looks like fewer eye rolls, more constructive feedback, and occasional moments of genuine agreement.

Remember that some of history's most valuable innovations came from people who questioned conventional wisdom and refused to accept ""that's just how things are done."" Channel that critical energy toward improvement rather than obstruction.

These strategies work because they're based on human psychology rather than wishful thinking. They acknowledge reality while creating pathways toward better outcomes for everyone involved.

Your consistent application of these approaches will gradually shift the dynamic from adversarial to collaborative. The skeptic may never become your biggest cheerleader, but they can become a valuable contributor to your shared success.

The investment in patience and understanding pays dividends not just in improved relationships, but in better outcomes for projects, teams, and organizations. When everyone feels heard and valued, even the most skeptical voices can become forces for positive change.

Start small, stay consistent, and trust the process. The transformation may surprise you both.

(This is from the bean grinding setting)

I can do a work around by letting it dispense its two cups, then opening and closing the filter door so it will brew again, changing the setting to pre-ground coffee, and hitting the start button. But it only adds two more cups until I have to do it all over again until I finally get the amount of water I want through the beans. Frustrating.

I have descaled, done a reset, unplugged and re-plugged, and thoroughly cleaned the machine to no benefit. Has anyone else had this problem or know how to fix it?

We’re thinking of driving to Viroqua tomorrow. The original plan was to go today have lunch at Driftless Cafe, but those plans fell through.


I understand that the cafe is closed tomorrow. Which is fine.

The general plan was to arrive about 8.30ish. Have coffee at Wonderstate, walk a bit in town, have brunch somewhere and head back around 12.30ish which is when my toddler starts sleeping.


That doesn’t give us a lot of time. But we’re looking for suggestions to do.


We’re driving from Madison,WI. We’re also open to things to do on the way/on the way back.

**I've dedicated the last month to driving across the country. I'm luckily able to, as my job allows me to work from anywhere that has an internet connection, cyber security to be exact. I started in Florida and worked my way through the southeast region of the U.S. After moving through both of the Carolinas I decided to swing by Tennessee while I was around.** 

**And I've got to say, the place was beautiful, the large metropolitan areas meshing with the deep forest was an amazing experience to be a part of. However it wasn't always good, for example, in some of the more densely forested areas I found it difficult to find coffee shops and other places with free wifi to work at.**

**Luckily however, GPS exists and it's usually not too long until I find one, and if I can't then I'll find somewhere where I can rent out for the night while I work. Well, one day after having very bad luck finding any establishments with free Wi-Fi so deep in the mountains,** 

**I got very lucky and was able to find a very nice 3 bedroom Airbnb cabin in the mountains for just 50$ a night. After confirming payment for one night, I head to the area where the house is at.** 

**As I'm driving to the cabin, I can't help but feel uneasy, this place is really deep into the forest, I must've been driving for at least 30 minutes straight just going deeper into the forested mountain range, all the while the road keeps thinning and lowering in quality all the way.** 

**What had started as a strong, well-made two-lane asphalt road eventually turned into a decrepit, one-lane, dirt road that barely even had a clear path, mostly thanks to the massive trees on either side accompanied by the brush occasionally having grown on the road.** 

**“Why in the hell would someone live this far out?” I ask myself, frustrated with the condition of the area. Even this far into the road trip I haven't gone down a road this bad yet. First time for everything, I guess.**



**Eventually after a few minutes of driving down the run-down road, if you can call it that, and I finally see it, the cabin. And I won't lie, this place was definitely worth the drive. It looked to be about 2000 square feet, made of very fine, finished wood logs and gorgeous windows giving an amazing look into the forest. Walking into the house I'm surprised with how homey it looks.** 

**The first room is the living room lit by a familiar and warming orange glow, looking straight past the living room is the kitchen, sizable but not large, and nothing really notable about it. The living room however, had a very elevated roof and a fireplace to the right wall, A few taxidermied animal heads lay about it, as well as the skull of an animal I don't think I've ever seen, looking left of the living room, I see a sectioned couch with a very large mounted tv on a stand on the other side of the room.**

**Looking left I see the rest of the living room which wasn't really anything special, just a dining table and a few other pieces of furniture you'd expect to see in any house.**

**Past the living room to the left was a sizable hallway, which is where my host told me the bathrooms and master bedroom were. I walked down the hall to the door at the very end, which led to the master bedroom. And again upon walking in I'm blown away by the interior. It had a huge and very soft bed with enough pillows to smother a giant, and in front of the bed on the wall was another huge plasma TV. walking to the right I enter the bathroom and of course its lavish, large granite countertops and a marble bathtub as well as a huge walk-in shower. “There's no way this place is just 50$ a night.” I say to myself, blown away by the sheer luxury of a house so far away from civilization.** 

**I sit my stuff down and head to the back door, just past the kitchen to get a look at the backyard.** 

**and it’s even better than the front, there is a sizable pond that drains to a large stream flowing through the mountain. And of course, a well kept lawn all the way up until the tree line about 50 feet away. I stand there for a moment, impressed by the amazing area I've found myself in. It almost feels too good to be true.**

**Walking back inside the lavish cabin I go to the room to get my laptop so I can start working, and luckily, despite the GPS shenanigans, this place does have a stable internet connection. And so, I begin my work.**



**The hours fly by, and I don't even realize how long I've been working until my app for work closes abruptly. I look at the wifi icon at the bottom of my laptop and sure enough, it's dark, indicating my wifi connection has stopped working for some odd reason. glancing at the time I see it's 8 PM, looking out of the living room window I also see the sun beginning to lower in the sky.** 

**But that isn't my biggest concern. My boss told me if I'm not done with this project by next week I won't hold my position much longer, so getting this Wi-Fi back on is my biggest focus.**

**Walking outside with my phone flashlight, I go around the house looking for cables that might've gotten unhooked or unplugged in some way. Eventually I find the internet cable running down the side of the house and into the ground, but I'm dumbstruck as I realize the cable and the wall it's running along has massive and deep claw-looking incisions on it. “Damnit, you live in the forest and don’t have protected lines!?” I yell out in frustration.**

 **knowing that there's no way I can finish my work like this, I send a message to the host that I'm leaving early and of course let him know something shredded his cables.**

**But when I get to the front door, I see there’s pieces of paper hanging on it, at the top above a page full of writing is bold underlined letters that read; “***VIEW ASAP***”** 

**Taking the curious looking papers off the door, I take it inside and begin to read it.**



*To whomever is reading, I am sorry for what you are going to go through these next 48 hours, as it is likely you will not be alive by the end of them. However, if you read this carefully and take it seriously, you might make it out of this alive, so keep reading and TAKE.THIS.SERIOUS.*



*This house was built for people like you, unsuspecting travelers, to be part of a game. Not a game like the ones you see on TV. You are now a new toy for an ancient evil. No matter how skeptical or superstitious that sounds, it's the truth. Many years ago, miners uncovered something deep in the mountainside they never should have, just a couple miles from where you are now. Every year it demands someone to take part in its demented games, and if they survive 48 hours, they get to live free, but in the past 6 years nobody has survived and I doubt you will be any different. This thing is good at what it does.*



*But there is hope, there are rules you can follow that will greatly increase the chances of you surviving, these rules are a major part of whether or not you are still alive by the end of the next two days.* 



*Now this entity is clever, and likes to play with its food. It will likely attempt to break your mental before ever physically harming you. However,  its highly unpredictable nature makes it impossible to know its intention, it is likely it will do something neither you or I can plan for so always be on your toes.*



*Now that you know the entity and the situation, here are the rules for you.*



1. *Do not go outside after dark unless you have to, and be alert when it is,* *this is when it is most aggressive and active.*



1. *Prioritize lights, it thrives in the dark, if the power goes out at some point you need to go outside to the backyard and get them back on via* *resetting the Powerbox just past the treeline.* *If the Powerbox fails to reset, hide somewhere in the house and pray it doesn't know where you're at.*



1. *Barricade the windows. The windows are the easiest place of entry and they won't protect you for even a second once it arrives. There are supplies in the basement for you,* *open the trapdoor in the master bedroom closet behind the suitcases.*



1. *10PM-12PM are the only two hours each day where it will not attack you. I highly suggest you use these hours for sleep.*



1. *It will come for you after 2-3 hours of you reading this,* *prepare as soon as possible.*



1. *Lock the doors but do not barricade yourself inside, the doors will hold and you may need to go on foot, although if you do your pretty much already dead, you can't outrun this thing in its own backyard.* 



*Again, I'm sorry, and good luck.*

  


**After I finish the papers I just stand there for a moment analyzing the words on the page for a few moments, dumbstruck not knowing what to think. Was this a prank by the locals? No, I'm too deep in the forest for that. Hell, I don't know, there's no way this is real, this is something you'd write in a book!**

**I go back to my room, balling up and tossing the fake paper into the empty fireplace for the next resident to ash.**

**Grabbing my belongings I still had barely gotten unpacked, I rushed out of the house heading straight for my truck. I had just thrown my stuff in the backseat when I noticed something was off. My back right wheel looks weird, like maybe it was going flat. A closer look around my truck reveals something terrifying.**



**All my tires had been slashed.**



**It takes me a moment to fully understand the gravity of the situation.**

**Before I'm even able to let it, I hear a terrifying sound from deep in the forest. It sounded like a person, screaming like they'd just had every bone in their body broken, but it wasn't right. It had some sort of distortion in it, like a cross between man and beast. Like it wanted something.**

**I don't care how dangerous or stupid it is to drive on slashed tires on a mountain, I am getting out of here.**

**I jump into the driver's seat, practically slam the keys into the ignition, turn, and nothing happens. The engine doesn't even stutter. There is nothing but silence.**



**I get out of my truck and rush to the front hood and swing it open.**

**What I see inside shakes me to my core.**

**My entire engine block had claw marks, destroying it entirely, a mess of slashed wires and bolt pieces lay scattered, spilled oil strewn across unevenly. Fresh oil.**

**This was recent.**

**I don't know why but I just stood there, staring. My mind was broken by the unbelievable horror of the situation. My deep thinking is broken again by the inhuman howl again, this time seeming angrier, or maybe closer.**

**This brings me to my bearings, and I begin sprinting back to the cabin, my eyes continually locking onto the tree line all the way.**

**I swing open the door and instinctually lock it between my fingers, almost autonomously.**

**Now rapidly breathing trying to make sense of everything, I notice something in the fireplace, the papers. I ran toward them and frantically pulled them out and unfurled them from the crumpled ball I'd left them in.**

**I begin scanning the paper, looking for anything it might have told me to do first. The rules! Rules 3 and 5 catch my eyes first, they seem to be the first things I should prioritize. I guess it's time to find this “trap door”, the third rule mentioned.**

**Walking back to the master bedroom with haste I can almost feel the sweat collecting on my brow, as I slowly realize whoever wrote those papers weren't lying, and I may very well be dead in the next few hours.**

**Arriving at the master bedroom’s closet I open the slide door and analyze my surroundings, clothes, shoes, suits, suitcases!**

**Kneeling before them I reach to the back and pull at least half sloppily to the side. And it reveals the top of the trapdoor, an old, dry, dull colored slab of wood with rusted hinges and a crooked doorknob.**

**Throwing the rest of the suitcases carelessly to the side I reach for the knob and twist, having to use my whole arm to get the knob to move. And as it does the door pops forward for a moment before eerily creaking its way open. Looking down all I can make out is a set of stairs that look like they might collapse with every step, plunging you into the void of darkness in the basement.**

**I guess the luxury ends here.**

**Pulling my phone out of my pocket I turn on the flashlight, the beam of light penetrating the veil of darkness instantly.**

**The white light reveals a medium-sized concrete-walled room covered in cobwebs and at least 50 planks of wood. The kind you always smell before you see at appliance stores.**

**I hunch my back and twist my hips at the waist, trying not to get stuck in the tiny door frame. As soon as my shoe hits the first plank of the stairs I hear a loud creak echo through the silence. I'm also hit with a putrid stench, a cross between roadkill and stuffy, century-old air.**

 **Regardless I push through, each stair wailing at me as I make my way down. The final step I can move my flashlight around the right corner to see a workbench with various tools and nails on it, but I don't think you could set anything more on it before it collapses, because of course its condition is highly sub-par. I push my light further right and nearly drop it when the light makes out the decomposing body of someone. their stomach has massive slashes in it and they seem to be missing an arm.**

**Before I can even make out more of the figure on the ground I bolt around and up the screaming stairs, not caring if one of them snapped. Once I'm back in the master bedroom I can finally think rationally.** ***Why did I run?*** **Sure, there was a literal dead body down there, but there wasn't any present danger but God, that was horrifying.**

**I now know for sure nothing in that letter was a lie, this was probably one of the earlier victims of this evil entity or whatever the hell it is.**

**Regardless, I don't want to be ended in the same way they or any of the others met their demise. I make my way back down there to take stock of the materials, trying not to think about the rotted corpses stench.**

**After a** ***very*** **fast evaluation and knowing my time is limited, I make my way back up to the room and dump all of my belongings out of my massive travel bag and trek back to the basement to stock up on some very well needed supplies.**

**I stuff the bag with anything that looks like it can be used, from saws to small bolts, anything will help.**

**The planks were hard to fit in my bag but I was luckily able to position them semi-vertical in a way that allowed me to lug them with me, completely convinced in my mind the extra weight is surely going to destroy one, if not all, of the planks.** 

**Luckily it doesn't and I make it to the top and immediately begin working tirelessly, boarding any window I see, hastily slamming each nail and sawing each board to fit the right dimensions, making multiple trips back and forth for more supplies. Out of respect I also grabbed the rug from the living room and covered the body in the basement. As little as it is, It's the best I can do for now.**

**After around an hour and a half of tireless labor, I finally nailed the last board into place over the living room window. I'm not done working however, I also go into the kitchen and grab all the knives I see and place a few scattered around each room in case I need to grab one in a hurry, placing a smaller pocket knife into my shoe, just in case. Judging by the paper it won't do much but something is better than nothing and right now I need all the comfort I can get.**

**After truly finishing my work I grab the papers off the ground and continue to read, looking for the next thing I should do. It doesn't seem like there's anything more I need to do, other than plug up my phone, then sit and wait until it's time.**

**Pacing around the living room, I find myself compulsively checking the time, counting down each minute, and it's been about two hours. So the game should be beginning at any moment, and lucky for me, it's night time!** ***Just 46 more hours*****. I think to myself, not feeling any more at ease.**

**A few more anxious minutes pass, and I hear a familiar sound.** 

**I hear those same inhuman cries coming from the front of the house.**

**It sounds terrifyingly close this time, just past the tree line if I had to guess.** 



**The game has begun.**



**Almost instantly I reach for the nearest knife and hold it tight, waiting for something to happen, although for at least a minute there's nothing.**

**But then the silence is broken by a loud slam on the front door.** 

**It makes me jump, hard. But luckily I managed to keep myself quiet.**

**Then comes another, and another.**

**The slamming on the door becomes more and more frantic and aggressive. The slamming became so hard I was certain the door would come down at any second, as I could see with each impact the door shakes and trembles. large impacts on thick wood became a ringing in my ears as the unrelenting slams continued.** 

**The sound of whatever this was so desperately attempting to get in puts fear so potent into my body I can only put my back to a wall and slide down, pointing my knife toward the door, tears rolling down my face.**

**Thankfully after many agonizing moments the pounding at the door pauses. I can hear a muffled low growl come from outside before heavy footsteps tread off somewhere in the forest.**

**Now I'm left on the floor, back to the wall in the fetal position, adrenaline coursing through every ounce of my being.** 

**Cops aren't going to save me, it's me against whatever this thing is.**

**But what can I do other than wait this thing out?**

**It's clear by the slamming on the door that this thing is far stronger than me or anybody I know, a knife isn't going to do anything to this thing.**

**I sit there for a moment, racking my brain for any kind of solution that might give me an edge. Then I'm hit with a stroke of genius.**

**There were taxidermied animal heads on the fireplace wall, there is a chance there could be a gun laying around here somewhere the note did not detail. And maybe if I'm lucky, ammo as well.**

*Where to look* **I think to myself, racking my head for ideas.** 

*Let's start with the closets.* **I say to myself, hoping there is at least something I can make use of.**

**Now walking out of the master bedroom into the unnervingly quiet hallway, hearing every wooden board settle under my weight.**

**I go to the closet to the right of the hall and twist the knob, opening the door, I'm met with a veil of darkness.** 

**I look up and see a cord coming down from the ceiling, and pulling it gives light to the darkness, revealing something that fills me with unmatched hope.**

**A box of .223 Remington rounds.**                

**This has got to be one of the best things I've seen in a long time.**

**I scan the rest of the closet, and to my surprise, there is no gun of any kind, but I'm not worried. Where there is ammo there is a gun.**

**Hastily, I grab the ammo box and I'm once again disappointed, the box feels very light.**

**I pop open the flap of cardboard on the top and to my horror, there are only 2 rounds in the box.**

**I yell and throw the box at the wall, the rounds flying out and loudly clinking against the solid wood floor. Right at that moment I realize my mistake, as I hear a shriek come from outside, followed by those same thumping footsteps.**

**I hear the steps clamber onto the porch followed by heavy scratching going down the front door, soon after this creature begins slowly walking around the perimeter of the house, going from the door toward the right of the house.** 

**Just when it sounds like it's going to pass the area outside in front of me, it stops for a moment.**

**For a second, there is nothing but me in the silence of the hallway, hearing my heart thud against my chest rapidly.**

**Then I hear the wood exterior of the house begin to splinter, the sound starting at ground level, but eventually it goes higher and higher until I hear the roof above me creak heavily, dust and settled cobwebs being knocked loose under the immense weight.** 

**It's climbed onto the house.**

**Now paralyzed in fear I stand in the middle of the hallway, watching the dust falling, getting closer and closer to where I'm standing. It isn't long until it's right above me, and just when I think the situation couldn't possibly get worse, the lights flicker, and everything goes dark.**

***Shit.*** 

**This is not good. I need to reset the power box as soon as I can, but there's no way in hell I'm going out there with this thing literally right above me!**

**Instead, I decided to take a very big risk, albeit still less risky than going outside. I take my phone out of my pocket and hit the flashlight icon, the rest of the hallway and part of the living room is instantly illuminated by the penetrating light. Before I can make a move, however, I hear a loud** ***thud*** **above me. Followed by another and another as I'm showered by falling dust and god knows what else.**

**I don't have time to think before my legs jump into action and I quickly make a mad dash to nowhere in particular, just anywhere away from here. So I scour the floor plan quickly trying to find a suitable place to hide before this thing is all over me.**

***Fireplace? No. Cabinets? No. Pantry? Yes.***

**Instantly I dash towards the double doors and swing them open and shut myself inside.**

**Now in oppressive darkness, I can only look through the crack that separates the two doors and listen. Eventually the slamming on the roof stopped, I guess it was strong enough to hold.**

**But the peaceful silence doesn't last long. I hear a piercing shriek followed by thunderous footsteps going off of the roof quickly followed by a hard shake as this thing hits ground level again.**

**The pounding footsteps go all the way to the back of the house.** 

**For about a minute, I can hear this thing walking around and on the house, trying to find a way in, occasionally scratching and banging on different areas of the house.**

**And for a long moment there is a pause, no noise, no footsteps, nothing but me, the dark, and my booming heart.**

**But after maybe 30 seconds of the loudest silence of my life, I hear a sound that makes my heart drop, I hear glass shatter.** 

**Quickly after this I hear the unmistakable sound of wood planks splintering and their hollow thuds bouncing off the wooden floor.**

**Given the distance of the sound, I can assume it's somewhere on the other side of the house, maybe the guest bedroom?**

**Regardless, this thing has made its way into the house.**

**There's nothing I can do now besides sit and pray it doesn't know where I'm at.** 

**After what feels like a lifetime passes I hear another noise.**

**It's more wood splintering, but this time it's at the master bedroom door. I peek through the tiny slit in the pantry door and try to see as much as I can, and through the deep darkness I can make out a faint orange glow, accompanied by a deep guttural growl somewhere down the hallway. Not long after slow heavy footsteps begin making their way closer to the living room.**

**I can hear my heartbeat get heavier than it already was, hearing the boards creak and wail under the weight of whatever this thing was.**

**Still looking through the slit with heavy anticipation, I watch as the faint orange glow gets brighter and brighter until the entire living room is casted in the warm color.**

**It's just when I try to get a better look into the living room when my arm hits something on a shelf, knocking it over and sending it crashing to the ground with a sharp thud.**

**Almost immediately the orange glow snaps to the kitchen accompanied by that same deep growl.**

**If I hadn't already given myself away, my heartbeat surely would as I could feel it pounding against my ribs, loud as a drum.**

**I see the glow get brighter and the thunderous footsteps get so close I feel the vibration in the floor with each movement this thing made.**

**And eventually, I see it.** 

**It's so unlike anything I've ever seen, its body was huge, easily towering at 8 feet at the least. It seemed to have Fur soaked in tar wrapped around its unusually muscular frame. It walked on all fours, its front, clawed arms much stronger than the smaller and shorter hind legs. Its head was of a worn deer skull adorned with cracked and broken antlers.** 

**It's now when I realize where the orange glow was coming from. Looking into its eyes I see two fiery glowing orbs.**

**Just then it slowly twists its head to me, the orbs illuminating me through the door.**

**No doubt this thing saw me. But it didn't attack, it just released a deep guttural laugh, turned, and left on the same path it had entered.**

**Once I hear the pounding steps leave into the tree line, I slide down the wall of the pantry and just sit there, still trying to make sense of everything.** 

**Even though I’d heard the pounding on the front door, seen the body in the basement and now even having seen the creature, it was all so hard to believe. None of this was grounded in reality anymore** 



**After a few moments of baffled thought I finally remembered.** ***The power’s out.*** 



**I needed to go outside and reset the power box before that thing came back, because if it does, I don't think it'll be here to toy with me again.**

**So, I manage to bring myself to my feet and exit the pantry, Turning on my flashlight, the vision of the house's kitchen coming quickly into view. I began walking to the back door past the kitchen, luckily it had a glass top so I could look into the backyard for a moment to ensure I didn't see even the slightest orange glow.**

**After grabbing the doorknob and hesitating for a moment, I throw the door open and begin sprinting across the large, unusually kept lawn.**

**It's hard to tell with just my flashlight but it seems like there is a large metal box with wiring strewn about, and I'm willing to bet that's the power box.**

**After making it across the large backyard I go into the tree line right up to the metal plated box.**

**For a moment I don't see anything, just the smooth grey surface of metal.**

**I looked around the box quickly, seeing a blue button on the back of the box that read; “*****RESET*****”.**

**Instantly I mash the button which causes the box to make a loud pop before humming to life, across the lawn I can see the warm orange glow of the house's lights. It's such a relieving sight that I almost didn't notice the pair of orange eyes on the roof, piercing through the night.** ***Looking at me.*** 

**Instantly my body locks in place, ice encapsulating every inch of my skin.**

**Though it's nighttime and dark, I can still make out the large muscular build of this creature, Large heaving breaths exiting in a thin smoke through the nostrils of the deer skull.**

**For what felt like ages neither of us made a move.**

**I felt like I was staring at this thing for so long I had thought maybe it hadn't seen me.**

**Maybe it was just curious about the noise the power box made.**

**Maybe I was right, or maybe I had been blessed, but either way, the beast made one last deep growl in my direction before sluggishly disappearing behind the other half of the house's roof, disappearing into the deep inky night.**



**The moment I can no longer hear the thunderous footsteps my legs kick into gear and begin throwing me across the yard to the house.**

**I make it inside, slamming and locking the door behind me in a frantic panic.**



***“I have to fix that window”*** **I think to myself.**                                       



**I hated having to go into that basement, but this was survival, and so I did, getting the boards I needed and hastily fixing the window, and as i'm fixing it, I see the smallest amount of light start to peek over the mountaintop, signaling hope, and a reprieve, I've made it through the first night.**

**As I'm leaving the guest bedroom after boarding the window, I turn to close the door behind me, but I see something strange under the bed, some kind of cloth?**

**I go towards it and kneel down, pulling a dark green strap. And as I pull my arm back I'm blessed with the sight of a bolt-action rifle.**

**It's old and dusty, but it seems like it was stable enough to shoot.**

**I spent what little time was left of the night to take apart and clean the weapon, as best as I could anyway.**

**When I'm done I load the two rounds into it and push the bolt forward, making it ready to fire.**

**I hadn't noticed but outside I could hear the faint sounds of birds chirping, glancing out of the window I could see faint slits of blue through the wood boards. Hopefully this thing will back off a little with it being daytime now.**

**I take my phone out of my pocket and see that it's 9 in the morning, one hour until I can finally sleep safely. Even if it's just a few hours, it's enough to keep me alert.**

**The time seems to go by at a crawling pace, I was mostly hoping this creature wouldn't try some last trick on me before letting me get some shut eye. And to my surprise nothing happened.**

**So, when 10’clock struck I immediately set an alarm, so I didn't oversleep, and promptly passed out on the couch.**



**It almost feels like no time passes before a loud crash sends me flying to my feet, chest heaving and my senses clocking into overdrive as I try to gather my surroundings.**

**At first, I see and hear nothing, but my skin feels slightly cold, and the air around me seems.. Cleaner in a way.**

**As my eyes adjust I can see a faint glow of moonlight casted on a forest of large pine trees.**

**I'm somewhere in the mountains no doubt, but how? I vividly remember collapsing onto the couch.**

**Just then something breaks the silence.**

**I hear a sound I'm very familiar with. A loud thud shakes the earth beneath my feet as multiple twigs snap just a few yards away**

**My blood runs cold as I slowly turn around, and sure enough, my gaze meets that same creature that has been haunting me these past few hours, a mere 10 feet away.**

**Its entire body is ink black, that same tar-like substance matting its fur glows under the moonlight with the only other light being the fiery orange glow of its dead eyes. The beast is staring daggers right through me, a thin mist escapes from under the deer skull with each heaving breath it makes.**

**Then the creature leaps toward me, its huge arms fully extended outward.**

**Then my eyes fly open.**

 **and I'm back in the cabin.**



**For a moment everything is still, the air is warm and I can hear a cacophony of birds chirping amongst themselves.**

**Despite the terrifying nature of the dream I just had, I'm surprisingly calm.**

**I flip my phone over and check the time, 11:59.**

***Well, that couldn't have been timed better*****. I think to myself, bringing myself to my feet.**

**It wasn't a long sleep by any means, I'm definitely still tired but it's manageable, I'll be able to make it to the next break.**

**For a while nothing happens, I've searched the whole house multiple times over looking for anything else of use, but nothing is uncovered.**

**It feels as though I'm just on a regular vacation sometimes, nothing happens for 30 minutes to an hour and everything feels normal.** 

**I can hear the birds outside, the random call of the mountain animals, even the occasional plane overhead.**

**I can see the morning light shining through the small cracks in between the boards on the windows. It's oddly calming considering the situation, maybe I'm just happy it's not night, and one day closer to making it out of this hell.**

**Around 40 more minutes pass with nothing, deafening silence only broken by the occasional settling of the house that sends me flying to my feet each time. I've noticed I’m so much more jumpy now, for good reason of course.**

**For so long the silence dragged on, despite being so on edge, the lack of any stimulation eventually reached me, and I began to feel my eyes grow heavier as time passed.**

**And so I began to pace around the house to make sure I didn't pass out.**

**I also decided to go into the master bedroom bathroom to see if there could be anything of use, but despite looking to the best of my ability I can't seem to find anything. I figure even though I've looked already, if I keep searching the rest of the house I might find something.**

**So I leave the bathroom and open the door to enter the hallway, where I'm stopped dead in my tracks.**



**Right there at the entrance of the hallway, stood the beast, with the corpse from the basement hanging lifeless in its jaws. And right behind it was the bolt action rifle, my only hope, leaning on the living room couch; right where I'd left it.**

**How? How could it have made it inside without making a noise? How did it even get to the corpse?**

**I don't have time to think about the reality of the situation, as the beast releases its jaws, dropping the body to the floor with a solid thud. Massive tooth marks sunken deep into its rotted flesh.**

**I should've ran, hidden, closed the door, anything. But I just couldn't bring myself to move.** 

**I could only sit still and stare at the creature, a mix of blood and saliva dripping from its gaping maw.**

**Finally fully realizing the horror of the sight in front of me, I snap into action, slamming the door and bolting to the closet to hide in the basement. Maybe I'll be lucky and it wont fit past the trap door.**

**Frantically I swung into the closet, running to the trap door.**

**I make it to the tiny, dried wood door and try to swing it open, but it doesn't budge, I pull again, harder this time, but it doesn't move an inch.**

**Now the creature is at the room door, and I can hear it slam its fist into it as the sound of wood splintering cracks through the air.**

**Now I begin frantically pulling on the door, trying desperately to get it open but it simply will not budge.**

**A second impact rocks the door. This time I hear it tear off the hinges and crash to the floor.**

**In a desperate panic, I lean back and begin slamming my heel into the door as a last-ditch attempt. And finally, the door splinters and pops open.**

**Just as it does however, the closet is illuminated in the same orange glow I'd seen so many times before. I try to throw myself down into the darkness of the basement but I'm too late.**

**Just as I leap I feel the creature's massive hand grab my body tightly and pull me backwards. Its hand is so massive it wraps around my entire chest, so tight I can't draw a breath.**

**And as it turns me around, I'm face to face with the beast that is about to kill me.**



**But for a moment it just holds me there, turning me side to side, examining me, tightening its grip so hard I feel my ribs begin to cave inward, threatening to snap at any moment. The pain is blinding and I can feel myself about to pass out from the lack of oxygen.**

**Just as the darkness reaches the edges of my eyes, just as I feel my bones giving out from the immense pressure, an epiphany hits me. I remembered so many hours ago I had put a knife into my shoe!**

**With time limited and my life on the line, I lift my leg up and grab the knife out of my shoe holding it high in the air above the beast.**

**I see it tilt its head upwards, seeing what I'm doing.**

**Before it can do anything, I plunge the knife deep into its right eye.**

**The creature lets out a shrill shriek and drops me to the ground, its hand clawing at the knife, still plunged handle-deep into its socket.**

**The beast looks up to me, still on the ground, ears ringing, trying to catch my breath. It releases a guttural roar that resonates pure hate.**

**Just then its eye releases a bright flash before a hard shockwave sends me flying backwards. Directly into the basement.**



**The first thing I feel is an intense pulsating pain in my head. I can feel a cold sensation on my body and something wet on my face.**

**I move my arms to pick myself up and I feel a cold, smooth surface that feels like it has a layer of either dirt or dust. As my senses begin slowly coming back to me I notice I'm surrounded by darkness. And I'd assume it was silent but the ringing in my ears makes it hard to tell.**

**For a moment I can't make sense of anything, with the intense head pain and ringing ears my mind is too clouded to think clearly.**

**It's then I begin looking around where I'm at, stumbling trying to keep from falling over as it feels like my head is spinning. At first it's the same darkness in all directions.** 

**But I eventually see a small light. Focusing my eyes I can tell it's a small doorway with a warm yellow light flooding through the darkness.**

 **looking down at my feet I can see a puddle of what seems to be water. But upon closer inspection I can notice a slight red hue to it.**

**To confirm my suspicions I lift my hand to the back of my head and sure enough, I feel a warm, slimy sensation,  and when I pull my hand back, it's covered in blood.** 

**Just then all the dots connect and it hits me. The cabin, the creature, the basement.** 

**I can now remember how I got here and the events that transpired.**

**What had I done? What was that flash after I injured the creature? Did it actually hurt it? Is it over? So many questions flood my aching head, it's too much.**

**I have to sit down and close my eyes for a moment. The small light from the doorway was making my head pulsate with even more waves of agonizing pain.**

**I take my phone out of my pocket and turn on the flashlight, making sure to squint eyes so the light doesn't unleash another barrage of aching pains in my head.**

**I turn the light to my left and I see a ripped and tattered mat where I had left the body.**

**It just doesn't make sense to me, how could that thing make it down here? But then again how has this thing doing anything it’s been doing. How the hell is this thing even real??**

**I finally have enough of my bearings to pick myself up off the floor. Approaching the stairs and ascending up, the familiar sound of old wood crying out all the way.**

 **And at the top my heart drops for a moment, as I see the beast at the closet door. But it’s not the foreboding monster it once was.** 

**Now it’s slumped on the ground, its arms sprawled, and its jaw hung open, a large black tongue resting on the carpet. And where bright, orange orbs once were now two black holes in the deer skull.** 

**Cautiously I walk to the massive corpse, kicking its head as I reach it. Confirming its death.** 

**There’s no celebration, no confetti or party. I don’t jump or yell. I simply look at the body on the ground and make my way to the front door.** 

**Stepping outside, I see its now noon, with the sun settling just under the mountain tops. I sit on the porch for a moment, just taking it all in. Happy to be alive.**

 **Woozy but lucid.** 



**“I think I’m gonna stick to hotels from now on” I say to myself. Glad to see a sunset. Even if it’s just one more time.**

1n4gxof,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n4gxof/the_ultimate_guide_to_managing_the_overly/,The Ultimate Guide to Managing the Overly Involved Person in Your Life 🎯,"
We all know that person. The one who shows up uninvited to every conversation, has opinions about decisions that don't involve them, and somehow makes every situation about themselves. Whether it's your colleague who micromanages everyone's lunch choices, your relative who rearranges your furniture during visits, or that team member who rewrites emails you didn't ask them to review – dealing with overly involved people is a universal human challenge.

## Understanding the Psychology Behind Excessive Involvement 🧠

Before we jump into solutions, let's understand what drives this behavior. Most overly involved individuals aren't inherently malicious. They often operate from:

**Fear of Loss of Control** 🎮
When people feel uncertain about outcomes, they may compensate by trying to control everything around them. Your project deadline becomes their emergency, your personal choices become their concern.

**Validation Seeking** 🏅
Some individuals derive self-worth from being needed or appearing knowledgeable. Being involved in everything makes them feel valuable and important.

**Anxiety Management** 😰
For many, involvement is actually an anxiety response. They believe that by controlling external factors, they can prevent negative outcomes.

**Learned Behavior Patterns** 🔄
Sometimes this behavior stems from childhood experiences or workplace cultures where involvement equaled survival or success.

## The Cost of Tolerating Excessive Involvement 💸

Ignoring this behavior comes with real consequences:

Your productivity drops when someone constantly interrupts your workflow with unsolicited advice. Your creativity suffers when every idea gets filtered through someone else's preferences. Your confidence erodes when every decision gets questioned or second-guessed.

Teams become dysfunctional when one person dominates discussions that should involve multiple perspectives. Projects get delayed when someone insists on reviewing every minor detail. Innovation stagnates when fear of the overly involved person's reaction prevents people from taking necessary risks.

## The Framework for Effective Management 🛠️

### Step 1: Document the Pattern 📋

Start tracking specific instances of unwanted involvement. Note the time, context, and impact of each incident. This isn't about building a case against someone – it's about understanding patterns and preparing for productive conversations.

**Example entries:**
- ""Tuesday 2 PM - Interrupted client presentation to suggest different font""
- ""Friday morning - Reorganized my desk setup without asking""
- ""Weekend - Sent 12 messages about Monday's routine meeting""

### Step 2: Set Crystal Clear Boundaries 🚧

Boundaries work only when they're specific, communicated clearly, and consistently enforced.

**Instead of saying:** ""Please don't interfere with my work""
**Say this:** ""I'll update you on project status every Friday at 3 PM. Please hold questions and suggestions until then unless there's an emergency""

**Instead of saying:** ""Stop being so controlling""
**Say this:** ""I've got this handled and will ask for input if needed""

### Step 3: The Redirect Technique 🔄

When someone tries to involve themselves inappropriately, immediately redirect the conversation:

**Their attempt:** ""I think you should handle the Johnson account differently""
**Your redirect:** ""Thanks for thinking about it. What's the status on your Miller project?""

**Their attempt:** ""Let me just fix this for you""
**Your redirect:** ""I appreciate the offer. I'm using this as a learning opportunity, so I'll work through it myself""

### Step 4: Strategic Information Management 🗂️

Control what information you share and when. Overly involved people often insert themselves because they have access to details that make them feel entitled to participate.

Share outcomes, not processes. Give updates on schedules, not methods. Provide results, not real-time progress reports.

### Step 5: Consequence Implementation ⚖️

When boundaries get crossed, implement immediate, proportional consequences:

**For minor overstepping:** Polite but firm correction in the moment
**For moderate violations:** Private conversation about the specific behavior
**For major boundary violations:** Formal discussion with documentation
**For persistent patterns:** Involve supervisors or consider relationship changes

## Advanced Strategies for Different Environments 🏢

### Workplace Applications

**During Meetings:** ""I'd like to hear from others who haven't spoken yet""
**For Project Management:** ""The decision-maker for this is [specific person]. Let's direct questions there""
**For Delegation Issues:** ""I'm confident in Sarah's abilities. Let's give her space to succeed""

### Family Dynamics

**For Parenting Interference:** ""We've got a system that works for our family""
**For Financial Advice:** ""We're comfortable with our approach and will ask if we need input""
**For Lifestyle Choices:** ""That's interesting. We're happy with our current arrangement""

### Social Situations

**For Event Planning:** ""Thanks for the suggestion. We've already decided on the approach""
**For Personal Decisions:** ""I appreciate you caring. I've thought this through carefully""
**For Relationship Advice:** ""I'll keep that in mind. How are things going with you?""

## The Long-Term Relationship Strategy 🤝

### Building Sustainable Interactions

Transform the dynamic by creating structured opportunities for the person to contribute meaningfully while protecting your autonomy. Give them a specific role that utilizes their energy productively.

**Examples:**
- Ask them to research options for a decision you're making, then make the final choice yourself
- Invite their input during designated brainstorming sessions
- Request their expertise in their actual area of competence

### Positive Reinforcement Approach 🌟

Acknowledge and appreciate when they respect boundaries or contribute appropriately. This reinforces better behavior patterns.

**Recognition phrases:**
- ""I really appreciated how you let me handle that situation independently""
- ""Your input during the planning session was valuable""
- ""Thanks for trusting my judgment on this""

## Crisis Management: When Things Escalate 🚨

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, situations intensify. Here's how to handle escalation:

### De-escalation Tactics

Stay calm and lower your voice when they raise theirs. Use their name frequently in conversation. Acknowledge their concern while maintaining your position.

**Script:** ""[Name], I can see this is important to you. I understand you're trying to help. I need to handle this my way, and I hope you can support that""

### When to Seek Support

Involve others when the behavior affects multiple people, impacts work quality, creates hostile environments, or persists despite clear boundary-setting.

### Exit Strategy Planning

For relationships where change seems impossible, develop gradual disengagement plans. Reduce information sharing, limit interaction opportunities, and build alternative support systems.

## Prevention: Creating Involvement-Resistant Systems 🛡️

### Personal Systems

Develop decision-making processes that don't require external validation. Create information-sharing schedules that prevent constant updates. Build confidence in your judgment through small, successful autonomous decisions.

### Team Systems

Establish clear role definitions and decision-making authority. Create communication protocols that specify who needs to know what information when. Implement regular check-ins that satisfy involvement needs without constant interruption.

### Environmental Design

Structure physical and digital spaces to reduce unwanted access. Use privacy settings on shared documents. Schedule focused work time when interruptions aren't welcome.

## Measuring Success: What Good Looks Like 📊

You'll know your approach is working when:

- You can complete tasks without unsolicited input
- Conversations stay on relevant topics
- Your stress levels decrease during interactions
- Other people notice and appreciate the positive change
- The overly involved person finds appropriate outlets for their energy

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ❌

**The Harsh Confrontation:** Attacking the person's character rather than addressing specific behaviors
**The Complete Shutdown:** Cutting off all communication instead of managing it effectively
**The Inconsistent Response:** Allowing boundary violations sometimes but not others
**The Guilt Response:** Letting emotional manipulation override your legitimate needs

## Adapting Your Approach Over Time 🌱

Remember that people and relationships evolve. What works today might need adjustment next month. Stay flexible while maintaining your core boundaries. Regular assessment of your strategies ensures long-term effectiveness.

The overly involved person in your life might never completely change, but you can absolutely change how you interact with them. By implementing these practical strategies consistently, you'll create space for yourself to thrive while maintaining respectful relationships.

Your peace of mind, productivity, and personal autonomy are worth protecting. Every small step you take toward better boundary management improves not just your life, but often helps the other person develop healthier interaction patterns too.

Success in managing these relationships isn't about winning or losing – it's about creating sustainable dynamics where everyone can function effectively while respecting each other's space and autonomy. Start with one technique, practice it consistently, and gradually build your skills. You've got this! 💪

We all know them. That colleague who bristles at feedback, the family member who turns every conversation into a battle, or the team member who takes every suggestion as a personal attack. Dealing with defensive people can feel like walking through a minefield, but understanding their psychology and learning effective strategies can transform these challenging interactions into opportunities for growth and connection.

## Understanding the Defensive Mindset 🧠

Defensive behavior rarely emerges from malice. Most often, it stems from fear – fear of judgment, failure, rejection, or loss of control. When someone feels threatened, their brain activates protective mechanisms that prioritize self-preservation over rational discussion. This ancient survival instinct served our ancestors well when facing physical threats, but in modern settings, it often creates more problems than it solves.

The defensive person typically experiences a flood of stress hormones that narrow their focus and reduce their ability to process information objectively. They may interpret neutral comments as attacks, helpful suggestions as criticisms, or honest mistakes as intentional slights. Understanding this biological response helps us approach these situations with greater empathy and effectiveness.

## Recognizing Defensive Patterns 👁️

Before diving into solutions, it helps to recognize common defensive behaviors:

**Immediate Rejection**: Shooting down ideas without consideration
**Blame Shifting**: Redirecting responsibility to others or circumstances
**Emotional Escalation**: Raising voice or becoming visibly agitated
**Historical Deflection**: Bringing up past grievances to avoid current topics
**Expertise Claims**: Asserting superior knowledge to dismiss input
**Victim Positioning**: Portraying themselves as unfairly treated

These patterns often repeat across different situations and relationships, suggesting they represent learned coping mechanisms rather than responses to specific circumstances.

## The Foundation: Creating Psychological Safety 🤝

The most crucial element in dealing with defensive people is establishing an environment where they feel safe to be vulnerable. This means consciously designing interactions that minimize threat perception while maximizing collaboration potential.

**Choose Your Timing Wisely**: Avoid approaching defensive individuals when they're already stressed, rushed, or dealing with other challenges. Find moments when they're relatively calm and have adequate time for meaningful conversation.

**Select Appropriate Settings**: Private conversations usually work better than public discussions, as they reduce the fear of public embarrassment. However, some people feel more comfortable with witnesses present, so gauge their preferences.

**Begin with Acknowledgment**: Start by recognizing their contributions, efforts, or positive qualities before addressing areas for improvement. This establishes goodwill and demonstrates that you see them as more than just their defensive behaviors.

## Communication Strategies That Actually Work 💬

**Use Collaborative Language**: Replace ""you"" statements with ""we"" or ""us"" language whenever possible. Instead of ""You need to improve your presentation skills,"" try ""How can we work together to enhance the impact of your presentations?""

**Frame Issues as Shared Challenges**: Present problems as obstacles facing the entire team or family rather than failures of the defensive person. This reduces personal threat perception while maintaining focus on solutions.

**Ask Questions Instead of Making Statements**: Questions invite participation and reduce the likelihood of triggering defensive responses. ""What do you think might help us avoid this issue in the future?"" works better than ""Here's what you need to do differently.""

**Validate Their Perspective**: Even when you disagree, acknowledge that their viewpoint makes sense from their position. ""I can understand why you'd see it that way"" doesn't mean agreement, but it shows respect for their thought process.

**Focus on Specific Behaviors Rather Than Character**: Address actions and outcomes rather than personality traits or inherent qualities. ""The report had several calculation errors"" is less threatening than ""You're careless with details.""

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Cases 🎯

When basic approaches don't yield results, these advanced strategies can help break through stubborn defensive patterns:

**The Assumption Check**: Before responding to defensive behavior, pause and examine your own assumptions. Are you certain about their motivations? Have you considered alternative explanations for their actions? Sometimes adjusting our own perspective eliminates the defensive response entirely.

**Strategic Vulnerability**: Share your own mistakes, uncertainties, or learning experiences. This modeling demonstrates that admitting imperfection is safe and normal rather than threatening.

**The Collaborative Investigation**: When faced with denial or deflection, invite them to help investigate the situation together. ""Let's both look at the data and see what story it tells us"" transforms adversarial dynamics into joint problem-solving.

**Future-Focused Conversations**: Instead of rehashing past problems, direct attention toward future possibilities and improvements. ""What would success look like going forward?"" is less threatening than analyzing previous failures.

**The Patience Investment**: Some defensive people need multiple positive interactions before they begin to trust that criticism won't be devastating. Consider these early conversations as investments in future productive discussions rather than expecting immediate breakthroughs.

## Adapting to Different Environments 🌍

**Family Dynamics**: In family settings, defensive behavior often connects to deep-seated patterns developed over many years. Long-term consistency in your approach matters more than perfect technique in any single conversation. Family members also benefit from seeing that acceptance and love remain constant regardless of their defensive responses.

**Workplace Scenarios**: Professional environments require balancing individual needs with organizational objectives. Document important conversations, involve human resources when appropriate, and maintain focus on job-related outcomes while still treating the defensive person with dignity and respect.

**Team Projects**: Group settings can either amplify or reduce defensive behavior depending on the dynamics. Establish clear group norms about feedback, ensure everyone has opportunities to contribute, and address defensive patterns privately rather than in front of the entire team.

## Building Long-Term Relationships 📈

Successful relationships with defensive people require patience and consistent positive reinforcement of non-defensive behaviors. When they do accept feedback gracefully, acknowledge and appreciate their openness. When they admit mistakes, respond with gratitude rather than criticism about why it took so long.

Create regular check-in opportunities where both parties can share concerns before they escalate into major conflicts. These scheduled conversations reduce the element of surprise that often triggers defensive responses while providing structured forums for ongoing communication improvement.

Celebrate small victories and gradual progress rather than expecting dramatic transformations. Defensive patterns typically develop over many years and require time to modify sustainably.

## Managing Your Own Responses 🎭

Working with defensive people can trigger our own emotional reactions, especially when their behavior seems unreasonable or obstructive. Developing emotional regulation skills becomes essential for maintaining effectiveness over time.

Practice separating their defensive behavior from their underlying worth as a person. Remember that their defensiveness usually reflects their pain or fear rather than their assessment of you personally.

Maintain realistic expectations about what you can and cannot control. You can influence the interaction dynamics through your choices, but you cannot force another person to abandon their defensive patterns.

Seek support from trusted friends, mentors, or professionals when dealing with particularly challenging defensive behaviors. These relationships provide perspective, validation, and practical advice for navigating difficult situations.

## When Professional Help Makes Sense 🏥

Some defensive behaviors indicate deeper psychological issues that require professional intervention. If someone's defensiveness involves threats, extreme emotional volatility, or complete inability to function in normal social or professional situations, encourage them to seek counseling or therapy.

In workplace settings, human resources departments can provide guidance about appropriate boundaries and interventions when defensive behavior affects productivity or team morale significantly.

For family situations involving severe defensive patterns, family therapy can provide neutral ground and professional facilitation for addressing underlying issues that contribute to these dynamics.

## Measuring Progress and Success 📊

Success with defensive people often comes in small increments rather than dramatic breakthroughs. Look for subtle signs of improvement: slightly less immediate rejection of ideas, occasional acknowledgment of valid points, or reduced emotional intensity during difficult conversations.

Track patterns over weeks and months rather than expecting change after individual interactions. Some defensive people show progress through increased willingness to engage rather than immediate agreement or acceptance.

Remember that your own stress levels and relationship satisfaction serve as important indicators of whether your approaches are working effectively over time.

## The Ripple Effect: How This Changes Everything 🌊

Learning to work effectively with defensive people transforms more than just those specific relationships. These skills enhance your overall communication abilities, increase your emotional intelligence, and improve your capacity for handling conflict in all areas of life.

Organizations and families that master these approaches often see improvements in overall communication culture, increased innovation as people feel safer sharing ideas, and reduced stress levels for everyone involved.

Most importantly, approaching defensive people with understanding rather than frustration models healthy relationship skills for others around you, creating positive ripple effects that extend far beyond the original challenging relationship.

## Practical Daily Applications 🌅

**Morning Preparation**: Before entering environments where you'll interact with defensive people, take a few moments to center yourself and remind yourself of your commitment to understanding rather than winning arguments.

**Real-Time Adjustments**: When you notice defensive behavior emerging, pause and ask yourself what fear or concern might be driving their response. This mental shift often suggests more effective approaches automatically.

**Evening Reflection**: Consider your interactions with defensive people as learning opportunities. What worked well? What might you try differently next time? This ongoing refinement improves your skills over time.

**Weekly Planning**: Identify upcoming situations where you'll likely encounter defensive behavior and mentally rehearse your preferred approaches. This preparation increases your likelihood of responding skillfully rather than reactively.

Remember that every defensive person represents an opportunity to practice patience, develop empathy, and strengthen your communication abilities. These skills serve you well in countless situations throughout life, making the effort invested in learning them incredibly worthwhile.

The most successful people often excel not because they avoid difficult personalities, but because they've learned to work effectively with everyone, including those who present initial challenges. By mastering these approaches, you position yourself for success in any environment while contributing to more positive and productive relationships for everyone involved.

1n4guyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1n4guyu/iberostar_selection_rose_hall_suites/,Iberostar Selection Rose Hall Suites,"My family and I just got back from 7 nights at Iberostar Selection Rose Hall Suites in Montego Bay, Jamaica. We went in late August 2025, and had fantastic weather the entire trip. We got lucky to dodge a couple of low pressure systems that either moved up the east coast of North America (Hurricane Erin) or never materialized into anything. 

All of my thoughts are through the lens of what this trip was like for my family, where we brought our 1 year old (14 months) and 4 year old. I wouldn't say we had a relaxing experience, but it was still a fun trip that we are glad we took.

The food was a solid 3/5 in my opinion. The buffet worked the best for us just because the 4 year old decided this week she wanted to be a picky eater, and the 1 year old didn't want to sit still long unless we had food to give her. So with the buffet we could serve ourselves and eat. I don't think we had a single relaxing meal, but that's just a function of traveling with little kids. The breakfast at the buffet was great daily. Omelets, pancakes, standard pastries that are also offered in the 24 hour coffee shop onsite, a huge fruit selection, smoothies, cereals, etc... Lunch and dinner options at the buffet varied. We especially liked the Jamaica night at the buffet.

The onsite restaurants left a lot to be desired. Our favorite one was the steak and lobster restaurant. The views overlooking the beach and dining in the open air were great, and the surf and turf was good. The Greek restaurant was okay, but not that good in my opinion. The menu options are good, but the quality of the food isn't anything special. For instance, our pita breads were stale. Also, of all the places we went this had the worst service. The Asian restaurant was just bad. The ramen noodles were plasticky, the ""sushi"" was questionable at best. Nothing that got us sick by any means, but not tasty. We did have reservations for the hibachi restaurant at the neighboring Iberostar Waves resort, but after talking with some friends we met who were underwhelmed there we decided to just stick to the buffet.

Again a friendly reminder that all of our food experiences might be jaded because of our kids. They usually eat earlier than the dinner restaurants open, so maybe they were just hangry which resulted in us having bad experiences. Hard to tell, but just wanted to get my thoughts out.

Service overall was fantastic. I'd say 9 out of 10 people every day were very friendly and helpful. By the end of the week most people knew our daughters by name and would welcome them everywhere we went. We did our best to tip for things like meals, drinks, housekeeping, and during some entertainment stuff like when my 4 year old had her face painted. I was very happy with the level of service we received.

The thing I am most disappointed with our trip was our inability to make use of all of the entertainment options they put on. I think the fault for this is split 50/50 between us traveling with little kids, but also with poor organization/advertising at the resort. They make a huge deal to make sure you download the Iberostar app (and you should!) because for each day it lists the activities they have planned and where they'll be. The issue is that this list is not very detailed, and then sometimes it's just innacurate. The best way we found to get an idea of what was going on was to just be at the main pool area when they made an announcement each morning of what to expect, but rarely would this match what was on the app. Or sometimes they'd list something but then if not enough people showed up for it they'd just cancel, which was a frustrating experience after hyping something up to our girls. Lastly, with the little kids we could not take advantage of the bulk of the nighttime activities. Most things didn't start until at least 8 pm, if not 9. After a full day of swimming at the beach and in the pool, there was no way they could last that long before bed, so unfortunately we just couldn't get to the shows or parties they put on. 

The resort itself was very clean. They did put up scaffolding while we were there and started to re-paint, but honestly I felt like this was a positive because to me it just showed how much they're dedicated to keeping up appearances. Every morning the crews were out making sure the grounds were clean and that things weren't out of place. 

The beach was a solid 8 out of 10 imo. We are big beach people, and we knew going in that this wasn't a pristine white sand beach. It's rocky, and after about 3 feet deep there is sea grass growing off the floor. Even with that though, it didn't take long to learn where the spots were that didn't have a lot of rocks, and where the areas with cleared out sea grass were. Once we figured that out we just made sure to get chairs near there each morning. Overall this was great for the little kids. I also paid $20 to the onsite dive shack and got access to a kayak, paddle board, and snorkel and fins for each day of our trip. There's a small artificial reef in front of the resort that I'd swim out to and each day I saw a bunch of tropical fish, some rays, puffer fish, and lionfish. There were a few vendors who would walk up and down the beach asking if you wanted a bracelet or whatever. They were all respectful if we gave a simple ""no thanks"" though and never pressured us. We ended up buying a couple conch shells to bring home and an ankle bracelet for the 4 year old. The only bad experience we had was one of them asked my wife to order her two drinks, which she obviously shot down. When the beach got windy, we'd take the girls to the onsite kids water park. The 4 year old especially loved this. Lots of slides and shallow water to run around in. It was also a good spot for the 1 year old to explore a little bit without having to be held in a deeper pool.

Because we booked for 7 nights, transportation to/from the airport was included via one of the onsite tour booking companies. This was easy to arrange and I appreciated having one less thing to worry about. 

This is already too long but I just wanted to dump my thoughts before I started to forget specifics. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask away and I'll do my best to answer. Overall we had a really great time and are happy to have done it (but also happy that we won't ever travel internationally with a 1 year old again lol.)

It took me a few months to finish the game - some of the battles were real nail-biters, some made me ragequit for a day or a week, but I persevered.

The balancing work done in this mod makes it so that every character class is viable, and there are endless team combos out there that are viable as well as fun. The mod adds a strategic depth that I think is fun, and not too overwhelming, compared some other mods I've tried in the past (in Final Fantasy Tactics, for example).

The one tip I can give is that it's no shame to grind a level or two, if you're struggling with a boss fight. I realized that this was an option when I had a level 17-18 team fighting against a level 24>!Regent Brantyn Morne and his evil front line defense of 6 Terror Knights!<. After grinding a bit to up to 19-20 and buying better gear, the fight became easier.

1n4gsrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OceanCity/comments/1n4gsrf/rainy_day_activities/,Rainy Day Activities,"We recently were in OCMD and had a few days where the beach was not an option because of Hurricane Erin. We have a 3 year old and 2 month old, so I was searching here and everywhere for things to do. We had success in making the days enjoyable so I thought I would share some options! Full disclosure, with the options below we spent about $150.00 for rides and arcade games (not including food).

1. Alley Oops (both uptown and midtown locations). We split $100 between two cards, and they were also running a promo where we got additional credits the next time we came back. We initially went on Tuesday, then went back to spend the rest of the credits on Thursday. Between the two days, we played for about 4.5 hours in total, without putting more money on. We did not do the bowling (because of the wait time). My 3 year old could not play some of the games, so my husband and I took turns playing games with him, and the other would go try to earn as much tickets as possible. Ended up with about 1300 tickets, which got him a decent sized vehicle he was able to play with in the sand, some army guys, and a tiny car. Both times we did not take our 2 month old (thanks to babysitting grandparents) but I would definitely recommend baby wearing instead of a stroller if you do have a baby with you, just because of the crowds. The second time we went, we ordered lunch. I got the seafood quesadilla, my husband got the smash burger, and my son got the kids hot dog meal (which was served on a frisbee). It was decent bar food that came out quickly and the total was $50. Both locations had a tank filled with small sharks and fish.

2.	⁠Indoor mini golf on 68th street. This Old Pro Golf indoor theme is sea/underwater and opened at 9:00 AM. We went to the Dunkin Donuts which was right next door and has outdoor seating…we sat there and had coffee and donuts till about 8:45, then walked across the street and waited for the doors to open for golf. The day ended up being nicer than expected, so there was not as big as a crowd as I noticed two days prior at the other indoor course, but it was worth it to get there early and be the first people in line. My toddler (and us) didn’t feel rushed and if there would have been a big crowd, we wouldn’t have had to wait in a long line. The place was started to get crowded as we were finishing up (around 10:00). They also have a small arcade area, but it was much more expensive. We put $20.00 on a card and were only able to play a handful of games, earning about 300 points. My son was able to get three little dinosaurs. Leaving this golf course, our son was fascinated with all of the dinosaurs outside (free 15 minutes of entertainment).

3.	⁠Trimper Rides at the boardwalk. Even though it was windy, it was great to head to the boardwalk because the crowds were minimal. We spent $30, which got our son 6 rides. The kiddie rides are indoor, which was perfect for about 1.5 hours of entertainment. He didn’t have to wait in any lines unless we got to a ride and it has already started. I want to say there was about 3 rides he didn’t ride (we were committed to the 6 rides only). He was not tall enough for the big bumper cars, but they did have kid bumper cars that he loved!

4.	⁠Boardwalk playground. Between 4th street and the inlet, I want to say 2nd street? There was a really nice playground that gave us about an hour of entertainment. We ended up here after dinner one night when it wasn’t rainy or windy, but still a great free option for kids!

Treats included sundaes at Dumsers, softserve from Dumsers, and French fries from Thrashers!

Also just a warning…all of the arcades had SO MANY claw machines filled with stuffies, candy, and plastic toys…

These things worked for us to pass some time throughout the week and honestly was worth the money spent because my son had so much fun (and we did too)!",9,1756599599.0,OceanCity,2,1.0,False

There was this guy, we'll call him Tom, in his early 20's, also at the same program and year as me. I just casually noticed him for almost a year but we never talked, I barely registered his existence. Then, I needed help and asked him something about the uni portal after a class one day as class ended. We kept talking and he seemed nice enough. Then he asked me if I was going to eat lunch at the cafeteria, so I went with him. Again, this was just two acquaintances talking. I told him I had a train to catch in two hours or so as I lived a bit away and Tom told me he'd accompany me and if I wanted to drink something first. I said sure and he took a bit of a romantic (?) detour to a park. Then we got coffee and it kept feeling more and more like a date by the way he was talking and smiling but I didn't think to much of it. 

After this, Tom kept texting me. I had given him my number at the cafe for uni stuff. He kept wanting to meet up and come to my city and I avoided making concrete plans. Eventually we did hang out near my house about a week or two later. We went to a bar and a restaurant and he kept sitting near me/flirting with me despite me not reciprocating at all. No, I didn't consider this a date at all, it was nothing friends wouldn't go out to do together. After this he again, kept texting me. This man texts me, I tell him I'm busy with \[x\], he texts me the day that is supposed to be over to meet up, rinse and repeat. It has gotten to the point that I put off texting him back for days thinking maybe he'll get the hint but he doesn't. I don't want to outright say anything because he hasn't done/said anything explicitly romantic and I have a feeling he'll deny/get mad? as he tends to be pushy in normal conversation. He keeps amping up the flirting as I try to ignore it in his texts but at this point I don't know what to do? I don't think I was being unfair to him but at this point I'm not sure. I couldn't just block him either, the new semester is starting and I'm going to see him often for literal years.

Picture this: You're in a meeting, and someone volunteers for the fifth project this week despite already being swamped. Or maybe it's your colleague who never says no to overtime, even when they're clearly exhausted. We've all encountered them – the eternal yes-sayers, the ones who bend over backward to make everyone happy, often at their own expense.

## Understanding the Yes-Pattern 🎭

People-pleasers aren't born this way overnight. They develop this pattern through years of believing their worth depends on others' approval. Think of it like a software program running in the background – every interaction gets filtered through ""Will this make them like me?"" rather than ""Is this good for everyone involved?""

These individuals often carry an invisible burden. They're the ones checking their phones at midnight for work emails, the family members who always host holidays regardless of their schedule, and the friends who drop everything when someone needs help.

## The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About 💔

When someone constantly prioritizes others' needs over their own, several things happen:

**Energy Depletion**: Imagine your energy as a smartphone battery. People-pleasers operate at 15% charge while everyone else is at 80%. They're constantly giving from an empty cup.

**Decision Fatigue**: Every choice becomes a complex calculation of what others want. Should I order pizza or salad? What if they think I'm being difficult? This mental gymnastics is exhausting.

**Relationship Imbalance**: Ironically, relationships become less authentic. People start expecting the constant accommodation, and the people-pleaser becomes resentful but can't express it.

**Lost Identity**: Over time, they lose touch with their own preferences, dreams, and boundaries. Ask them what they want for dinner, and you'll get ""Whatever you prefer"" – not because they don't care, but because they've forgotten how to access their own wants.

## The Daily Life Detective Work 🔍

Spotting people-pleasing behavior requires attention to subtle patterns:

**Language Clues**: Listen for phrases like ""I don't mind,"" ""Whatever works for everyone else,"" or ""It's fine"" said with a slight edge. These are often code for ""I'm not okay with this but don't know how to say it.""

**Body Language**: Watch for forced smiles, shoulder tension, or quick agreement followed by a slight pause. Their body often knows what their mind hasn't processed yet.

**Overcommitment Patterns**: They're always busy but somehow never too busy for one more favor. Their calendar looks like a game of Tetris with no gaps.

**Emotional Labor Distribution**: In families, they're often the ones remembering birthdays, planning gatherings, and managing everyone's emotions. At work, they're the unofficial therapists and conflict mediators.

## The Art of Supportive Response 🎨

Here's where most people get it wrong. The instinct is often to either enable the behavior (""You're so thoughtful!"") or criticize it (""Just say no already!""). Both approaches miss the mark.

**Create Safe Spaces for Honesty**: Instead of asking ""What do you want to do?"" try ""What would feel good for you right now?"" The subtle shift acknowledges their internal experience rather than demanding a decision.

**Model Healthy Boundaries**: Be the first to say no to unreasonable requests. Show them what it looks like when someone sets limits without the world ending. ""I can't take on that project right now, but I can help you brainstorm who might be available.""

**Validate Their Worth Beyond Service**: Comment on their ideas, insights, or presence rather than always focusing on what they do for others. ""Your perspective on that issue was really valuable"" hits differently than ""Thanks for staying late again.""

**Practice Patience with Their Process**: Changing people-pleasing patterns is like rewiring a house while living in it. There will be false starts, backtracking, and moments of panic when they think they've upset someone.

## Everyday Implementation Strategies 🛠️

**The Two-Option Method**: Instead of open-ended questions that trigger people-pleasing responses, offer two specific choices. ""Would you prefer we meet at 2 PM or 4 PM?"" rather than ""When works for you?""

**The Delay Technique**: When they immediately agree to something, gently suggest they think it over. ""This sounds important – why don't you check your schedule and let me know tomorrow?"" This creates space between the request and their automatic yes.

**The Assumption Challenge**: When you hear ""I'm sure it's fine,"" dig a little deeper. ""What would you do if you knew it wouldn't affect anyone else's feelings?"" This hypothetical removes the people-pleasing pressure.

**The Energy Check-In**: Make this a regular conversation. ""How are your energy levels lately?"" rather than ""Are you okay?"" The first question acknowledges that managing energy is normal and necessary.

## Building Long-Term Change 🌱

Real transformation happens gradually through consistent small shifts:

**Celebrate Small Boundaries**: When they say no to something minor, acknowledge it positively. Don't make a big deal, but a simple ""Good for you for protecting your time"" reinforces the behavior.

**Share Your Own Boundary Stories**: Talk about times you said no and it worked out fine. Normalize the idea that people respect boundaries more than they resent them.

**Create Accountability Without Pressure**: ""How did it feel when you spoke up in that meeting?"" focuses on their internal experience rather than external approval.

**Introduce the Concept of ""Good Enough""**: People-pleasers often aim for perfection to avoid any possible criticism. Help them experiment with 80% solutions that still meet everyone's real needs.

## The Workplace Application 💼

Professional environments can be particularly challenging for people-pleasers. Here's how to support them:

**Redistribute Emotional Labor**: Notice who always volunteers for the thankless tasks and rotate responsibilities. ""I'll handle the difficult client conversation this time.""

**Create Clear Role Boundaries**: Help them understand what's actually their job versus what they've taken on to be helpful. This clarity reduces guilt when they decline extra tasks.

**Advocate Upward**: If you're in a position to influence management, highlight their contributions that go beyond the people-pleasing. Ensure they're recognized for their actual skills and insights.

**Buffer Unreasonable Requests**: When possible, intercept inappropriate demands on their time. ""Actually, that's not Sarah's responsibility – let me connect you with the right person.""

## Family Dynamics Navigation 🏠

Home environments often have the deepest people-pleasing patterns because they're rooted in childhood experiences:

**Redistribute Holiday Planning**: If they always host or organize everything, suggest a rotation system. ""This year, let's all bring something instead of you cooking everything.""

**Create Space for Their Preferences**: Actively seek out what they enjoy. ""What's a movie you've wanted to watch?"" and then actually watch it, even if it's not everyone's first choice.

**Model Asking for Help**: Show them it's normal to need support. ""I'm overwhelmed with this project – could you help me think through it?"" This demonstrates that needing help doesn't make someone a burden.

**Respect Their Learning Process**: They might overcorrect initially, swinging from people-pleasing to being overly rigid with boundaries. This is normal and temporary.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

Supporting someone in developing healthier patterns creates positive change that extends far beyond your relationship with them. Their children see what healthy boundaries look like. Their colleagues learn that it's okay to protect their time. Their friends discover that relationships can be reciprocal rather than one-sided.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls ⚠️

**Don't Become the Boundary Police**: Your job isn't to monitor their every decision or point out when they're people-pleasing. This creates another form of pressure.

**Resist the Savior Complex**: You can't fix their patterns for them. Your role is supportive, not directive.

**Don't Take Their Growth Process Personally**: They might seem less available or agreeable as they develop boundaries. This isn't about you – it's about them learning to prioritize their own needs.

**Avoid Black-and-White Thinking**: The goal isn't to eliminate all accommodating behavior but to help them choose when and how to be generous rather than doing it compulsively.

## The Long View 🔭

Remember that people-pleasing patterns often develop over decades. Unlearning them takes time, patience, and consistent support. The goal isn't to create someone who never considers others' needs but to help them include their own needs in the equation.

Think of it like learning a new language. At first, they'll translate everything through their old people-pleasing framework. Gradually, they'll start thinking in the new language of balanced relationships and healthy boundaries.

## Moving Forward Together 🚀

The most powerful thing you can do is model the behavior you want to see. Show them what it looks like to care about others while also caring about yourself. Demonstrate that setting boundaries actually improves relationships rather than damaging them.

Be patient with the process. Celebrate small victories. Understand that there will be setbacks. Most importantly, remember that supporting someone doesn't mean managing their life for them – it means creating conditions where they can learn to manage it themselves.

Your consistent, understanding presence gives them permission to explore who they are beyond their people-pleasing identity. And that's one of the greatest gifts you can offer another human being.

The journey from people-pleasing to balanced relationships isn't just about individual change – it's about creating healthier communities, families, and workplaces where everyone's needs matter, including their own.

Of course, I've reached out once each month to let you know I'm still here. Hoping. It's always ended in disappointment. At this point, I know my number was probably blocked a long time ago.

We knew each other for less than a year. And there was no big explosive blowout or even a disagreement. It was just as simple as you not replying one day. And then that one day turned into this. Months. 

I'm doing fine. Good, even. In my career I'm receiving praise. I'm working in my field, finally. And I'm damn good at it. They put my report on a giant screen for our whole division to see. It was the first report I ever did there. And now it's going to a board meeting, too. Financially, I'm in the safest space I've been. I'm taking classes again. Music. And writers workshops. And I'm investing back in my hobbies. Making art again. I started making art again because we met-- did you know that? I haven't stopped, even in your absence. I'm seeing my friends again, now that I'm no longer in survival mode. Going to cafes and movies and record shops. 

Life is beautiful and I deserve to be a part of it. You told me that, once. I see it now. I know it is beautiful. But without you here? It's all in grayscale. I can see the scenery and the moving pieces, the cars driving down the road , the laughter of friends sitting at the bar together, the way rain falls on my window and trickles down gently as if to say ""the drought is over."" And maybe it is. But without you? I'll always be parched. 

You gave color to a world that I believed wasn't worth living in. You taught me to believe that I can, that I'm capable of doing the hard thing. The first thing I ever wrote about you was the line: ""Good people still exist."" And you do. Just not with me. And that's the part that's left an incurable ache in my chest. I feel it every day. Maybe you're not the first thing I think of in the morning anymore. But you're always the last thing before I go to bed, and the thing I dream about. 

Genuinely, I hadn't had dreams I remembered since I was in high school. But now when I wake up, I journal our meetings from my dreams. I don't want to lose those, too. I can't. I wish you'd come back. I wish for it when I'm driving to work in the morning, when I'm having my afternoon coffee, when I'm painting. 

Fall was your favorite season. It used to be mine, too. But now all I can think of is you. The autumn leaves remind me of falling like I fell in love with you. And I don't think I'll be able to handle it when I start to see them browning along the walkways this season. Without any explanation, you pulled the greatest disappearing act of all time. It hurts. You exist only four streetlights down the road from me, and somehow, I never see you. I know I'll never see you again. And it hurts. I don't think it will ever stop hurting.

I used to say: ""I'm never drowning when I'm with you."" But without you? I am. And truly, I can't think of a better way to go.

You hated that I used to call you my sunshine. Any time I said anything too real, too feeling, too ardently romantic, you'd flinch away. But it's true. You'll always be my sunshine. You were the still point of my turning world. Now everything keeps moving, and I can't keep up. Now everything is passing, and I am forced to move along with it. But I don't want to.

Moving means forgetting what you look like-- what you smelled like- what you sounded like. 

I ask myself every night before I go to bed-- what did he sound like when he was making fun of me in that sly, playful way? What did he sound like before ending our daily phone call? What did he sound like when he was telling me he trusted me, or that I was doing a good job? What did it sound like when he told me he loved me? 

I replay the memory of your voice every night. I can't cope with the fact that it's fading. I don't know what to do. But if I'm ever forced to let go of these memories, rest assured, they'll have claw marks running down the sides.

I miss you, sunshine. I always will.",1,1756599381.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,1.0,False

(To herself) “Oh no… Not again… How could I mess up this badly…”

 

(Listener enters)

 

“Oh, hey. First time coming through? Feel free to browse, we have plenty of choice. Let me

know if you’re looking for anything in particular.”

 

(Silence as listener browses)

 

“Damn, they’re SO cute. What was I doing again? Oh, that’s right. This

stupid database… What is this thing running on? Software from the 90s or what?”

 

(Sigh)

 

(Silence as listener comes back)

 

(Annoyed) “What?” (Clears her throat) “I mean, can I help you?”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Yes. Well… Unfortunately, we are currently having trouble with our database so I can’t really

help you with that. But… I am willing to help you search for that book. Nothing beats good old

fashioned pen and paper, right? What’s the name of the book?”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Exquisite tastes if I do say so myself. One of the best romances I have ever read. I think it’s over

there, please follow me.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Fantasy? Oh… I mean, yes of course. I think I had it mixed with something else I was reading. I

knew you didn’t seem like the type to read romance.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Why? Because… Because… You know… You’re… You?”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“What I mean?” (Laughs nervously) “I’m just talking silly, don’t mind me. I’m kind of…. Stressed.

Yeah, stressed, that’s it. Haha…”

 

(Awkward silence)

 

“So here we are. I hope. Should be on one of these shelves up there. Or down there. If it’s not

there, try these shelves over here.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Uhh… You’re right, I don’t know where it is exactly. I just sort of remember the aisle. Could be

anywhere from all the way down there to all the way up here. You’ll never know until you find

it, I guess.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

(Playfully) “I don’t know what you’re on about, I’m very helpful. I could have left you to wander

the entire store for ages but I was kind enough to point to you the exact aisle.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Alright, fine. You got me. I’m new here. I sort of know where things are but not entirely.”

 

(Under her breath) “Besides, how can I be expected to think clearly when I have such a lovely

sight in front of me? Gosh… Look at these lips, the cut of that jaw… They’re… Perfect.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

(Flustered) “What? You… You heard that? I- I didn’t mean to say that aloud… I’ll… I’ll be at the

counter once you’ve found what you’re looking for okay? Bye… I mean… Happy hunting… of the

book…”

people…”

“This whole aisle and it’s not there? Are you sure?”

“I- I was sure it was… I’m sorry… I’m not a very good clerk.”

“Y-You’re not mad? Really?”

“Thank you. I will find you that book. I swear it! That thing can’t hide from us forever!”

“Yes! I am determined! My job is to help you find you that book, and I will!”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“You like it when I’m being dramatic? Y-You mean that? That’s the first time anybody said that

to me. I- I appreciate that.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“It gives me character? Now you’re just being flattering.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Me? Authentic? Heh… You don’t really know me.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“I go above and beyond for a single customer? I wouldn’t really say that. I’m just doing my job.

We don’t get a lot of customers as you can see. All books are mostly online now. I, for one,

appreciate that you took some time out of your day to come get a book in material format. It

feels more…  authentic… I guess you aren’t entirely wrong about that part. We both like

authenticity.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“I’m not that bad at my job? Well… Let’s ignore the fact that I crashed our entire database a few

moments ago…”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“No. Of course, I was just joking about that last part… Allegedly.”

similar in that font! Anybody could have made this mistake! I swear! I swear I’m not bad at my

job!”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Yes. Yes I did crash the database but I found you that darn book! That’s one for one in my book! No pun intended.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Finding a book doesn’t fix a database? No… But it proves I’m still good for something! Even-

Even if I caused both problems…”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Sure, but I could have not helped you!”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Bare minimum? I guess, but I achieved the bare minimum! I don’t care what you or anybody

else says!”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Yes. It does make me feel better. Somewhat. And it’s all thanks to you. You know, for being

there and speaking to me like I am actually a person worth talking to and not just a clerk to use

to get what you want.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“It does mean a lot to me. I’m… Not usually good at anything. But you made me feel like I was

worth something, for once. The only reason I got this job is because my aunt needed somebody

to replace the last person who left in a rush. This is my last chance to feel… Normal. And you did

make me feel normal today. Even if just for a short while.”

 

(Silence)

 

“Hey, I don’t mean to force you to do anything but… Would it be okay if I… Gave you a little

something to thank you?”

 

(Kisses listener’s cheek)

 

“All for you, beautiful. Ahh… Too forward… I’m sorry. That was… I’m sorry!”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“You don’t mind being kissed by a pretty girl? Well… If you keep talking that way to me, I might

just kiss you all day and all night long.”

 

(Silence)

 

“You know, it’s nice being so close to you. I don’t mean to sound clingy but… When are you

free?”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“In a few days… Aw… Well… I suppose you can’t look like that and not be busy, right? Anyway,

let me register that book of yours. We didn’t go through all of this trouble to find it just to leave

it there.”

 

(Walks back to counter and registers book)

 

“There. Oh, wait.”

 

(Scribbles on piece of paper)

 

“That’s my number. Please call me when you’re free. I wouldn’t mind seeing you again.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“What I would like to do? Oh… Er… Maybe go for a cup of coffee? I know a nice coffee shop just

down the street. It’s very cozy and I really like it. I think you would like it too. It’s quiet and it’s a

good place to relax after a long day. I would really appreciate it if we could go there together

someday.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“That’s a yes, then? Great! I know I might not be the most competent or the most social, but I

feel that we have a deep connection to each other, stronger than with most people. I want to

explore that connection with you. I want it more than anything, it’s unreal.”

 

(Silence)

 

“Wow. I got a bit too real there, didn’t I? I don’t care. It’s the truth. I have been feeling lonely for

so long and now here you are, exactly what I was yearning for. A girl can dream, can’t she?”

 

(Sigh)

  
“Anyway, I won’t hold you any longer. Enjoy the rest of your day, and your book. That’s a good

pick. Oh, and don’t forget my phone number, too. Give me a call when you can, okay? I will be

waiting eagerly. Don’t make me wait too long, beautiful. I might just hire a private detective to

go catch you like in one of those crime novels. Just kidding… S-Sort of… Aah… What am I saying?

H-Have a good day, now! Looking forward to your call!”

 

(Listener is about to walk out)

 

“Wait.”

 

(Kisses listener on the cheek again)

 

“That’s for accepting to go on a date with me.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Clingy? Heh. Maybe I am. Can you blame me? My heart is racing right now. I never felt this way

before. I’m just not very experienced. You’re just like… sunshine that broke through the clouds

on a stormy day to brighten up my world. For the first time in a long time, I have hope for the

future.”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Putting too much pressure on you? Well… Maybe… But I really want this to work. You know? I

will try very hard! I don’t want this to fail like everything else! I promise you that I can make it

happen! So long as you try your best yourself! But we make a good team together anyway,

right? We did find that book after all, despite all hope being lost. So the moral of the story is

that there is always hope!”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“Yeah. Yeah. I’m being dramatic again and you need to go. I get it. Sorry, I get lost in my head

sometimes. Have a great day, again. And call me sometime, okay? You won’t forget? You

swear?”

 

(Listener talks)

 

“You better not. Okay bye!”

 

(Silence)

 

“Wait, where did I leave the fanfic I was writing?”

 

(Silence)

 

“Aw, don’t tell me I wrote my phone number on the back of that page… They’re going to think

that I’m such a pervert! Why am I like this?”

It's her first time on the Island, so we're going to nights where she thinks she'll enjoy the music.  I've warned her about the crowds!  

We're out for a good time, to dance and have fun, but also enjoy exploring during the daytime too.  So, we've a few questions we're hoping you guys can help us out with on our current itinerary 🙏

Thursday 11 September:
Land, check in in Bossa, head to Amnesia.  Do we need tickets in advance, or can we get on a guest list for this?

Friday 12 September:
Explore Dalt Villa, find somewhere for lunch/rooftop drinks, and chill before Ushuaia and UNVRS.  These were a must for her, so we're sorting tickets in advance. 

Saturday 13 September:
Day trip to Formentera - we're looking for recommendations for a fun boat trip to take us there and back, and for where to make a lunch reservation 🙏  We fancy a beach day, then plan to hit Hi for Black Coffee.  [Although I desperately want to try to get to Chinois for Claptone, too - is it possible to do both? 🤞]  Is this another one to get tickets in advance for?

Sunday 14 September:
Day trip to San An.  O Beach, walk around, watch the sunset.  Then Pacha for Solomon.

Monday 15 September:
Rest, recover, and catch our flight home to Manchester at 2315.  Can we fit in a hike somewhere nice (if we're not wiped out)?  If so, where would be best to find a decent route and some stunning views while we're probably not at our most energetic?  Or would we be better finding a beach club? 

Any recommendations or advice you can share would be really welcome - thanks! 💛🙏

Also, one more question: is ticketsibiza.com a legit site to get tickets from??

*Transform challenging interactions into opportunities for growth and understanding*

---

## The Universal Challenge We All Face 🤔

Every workplace has one. Every family gathering includes at least one. Every friend group knows the type. That person who seems permanently locked into their way of thinking, resistant to new ideas, and convinced they hold all the answers. These individuals aren't necessarily bad people—they're simply operating from a place of mental rigidity that can create friction in relationships and stifle progress in group settings.

Understanding how to navigate these relationships isn't just about keeping peace; it's about developing skills that will serve you in every area of life, from boardroom negotiations to holiday dinners.

## Recognizing the Patterns 🔍

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to identify the behaviors that signal closed-minded thinking. These individuals often:

Display an immediate defensive response when presented with alternative viewpoints. Their first instinct isn't curiosity but protection of their existing beliefs.

Interrupt conversations frequently, not to add value but to redirect back to familiar territory where they feel comfortable and in control.

Use absolute language consistently—words like ""always,"" ""never,"" ""impossible,"" and ""everyone knows"" pepper their speech, leaving little room for nuance or exception.

Dismiss evidence that contradicts their position without genuine consideration. They might acknowledge your points superficially while internally rejecting them entirely.

Show reluctance to ask genuine questions about opposing views. Instead of seeking to understand, they focus on finding flaws or preparing counterarguments.

Create binary thinking patterns where complex issues become oversimplified into right-wrong or good-bad categories.

## The Psychology Behind the Behavior 🧩

Understanding why people develop rigid thinking patterns helps us respond with empathy rather than frustration. Several factors contribute to this mindset:

**Fear of being wrong** runs deeper than simple pride. For many, admitting error feels like a fundamental threat to their identity and competence. They've built their self-worth around being right, making flexibility feel dangerous.

**Cognitive overload** in our information-rich world creates a natural tendency to stick with familiar frameworks. Constantly evaluating new information requires mental energy that feels exhausting, so the brain defaults to existing patterns.

**Past experiences** may have taught them that changing their mind led to negative consequences—perhaps ridicule, loss of authority, or costly mistakes. This creates an association between flexibility and vulnerability.

**Social identity** becomes intertwined with specific beliefs or approaches. Changing their mind isn't just about updating information; it feels like betraying their group or losing their place in their community.

## The Strategic Approach: Building Bridges Instead of Walls 🌉

### Start with Common Ground

Begin every interaction by identifying shared values, goals, or concerns. Even the most rigid thinker usually shares basic human desires—success, security, respect, or wanting what's best for loved ones. When you establish this foundation first, subsequent discussions feel collaborative rather than combative.

For example, if discussing a workplace process change with a resistant colleague, start with: ""We both want this project to succeed and reduce stress for everyone involved."" This frames future suggestions as serving mutual interests rather than challenging their expertise.

### Use the Question Bridge Method

Instead of presenting statements that sound like corrections or challenges, frame your ideas as questions that invite exploration. This technique bypasses their defensive mechanisms while introducing new perspectives.

Transform ""That approach won't work because..."" into ""What do you think would happen if we tried..."" or ""Have you considered what might occur if...""

This method allows them to discover insights on their own, which feels empowering rather than diminishing. People are more likely to accept ideas they feel they've helped develop.

### Employ Strategic Patience

Rigid thinkers rarely change their minds during the initial conversation. They need time to process information privately, away from the perceived pressure of immediate response. Plant seeds of new ideas without expecting immediate harvest.

Follow up on previous conversations by referencing their own words: ""Remember when you mentioned concerns about efficiency? I found something that might address exactly what you were talking about.""

### Validate Their Expertise While Introducing Options

Acknowledge their knowledge and experience genuinely before suggesting alternatives. This reduces the threat level of new information and helps them see suggestions as additions rather than replacements.

Try phrases like: ""Given your experience with similar situations, what's your take on this alternative approach?"" or ""You probably know better than anyone the challenges involved—how do you think this option might address some of those?""

## Practical Techniques for Different Settings 🎯

### Family Dynamics

Family relationships carry decades of established patterns and emotional history. Apply these specific strategies:

**Choose your battles wisely.** Not every difference of opinion requires resolution. Focus your energy on issues that genuinely impact family harmony or important decisions.

**Use storytelling instead of direct advice.** Share experiences from other families or situations without explicitly connecting them to current disagreements. Let them draw their own parallels.

**Create neutral environments for discussions.** Avoid loaded locations or times when emotions typically run high. A walk or shared activity can provide a less threatening context for exploring different viewpoints.

**Involve mutual allies subtly.** If other family members share your perspective, coordinate gentle, consistent messaging rather than ganging up in direct confrontation.

### Professional Environments

Workplace dynamics require diplomatic approaches that respect hierarchies and professional relationships:

**Document everything positively.** When suggesting changes or alternatives, frame them in terms of business benefits and measurable outcomes. Rigid thinkers often respond better to data than emotional appeals.

**Use pilot programs or trial periods.** Instead of pushing for permanent changes, suggest limited experiments. This reduces the perceived risk of being wrong and provides face-saving opportunities if adjustments are needed.

**Leverage their strengths in implementation.** Once they accept an idea, give them ownership over how it gets executed. This transforms potential resistance into investment in success.

**Create peer learning opportunities.** Sometimes rigid colleagues will accept ideas from industry peers or external experts more readily than from internal team members.

### Social Circles and Friendships

Social relationships offer the most flexibility but require careful balance to maintain connection:

**Practice active listening without agenda.** Sometimes rigid thinking stems from feeling unheard or undervalued. Giving them genuine attention to their perspectives can create reciprocal openness.

**Share your own learning experiences.** Talk about times you changed your mind about something important. Model intellectual humility and curiosity as positive traits.

**Find shared activities that naturally expand perspectives.** Travel, new experiences, or exposure to different communities can gradually broaden thinking without direct confrontation.

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Situations 🚀

### The Assumption Reversal Method

When someone holds a rigid position, identify the underlying assumptions and gently question those rather than the conclusion. For example, if someone insists ""Remote work never produces good results,"" explore their assumptions about productivity measurement, communication methods, or work motivation rather than debating remote work directly.

### Strategic Concession

Acknowledge areas where their approach has merit while introducing modifications. ""Your point about maintaining quality standards is crucial. What if we kept those standards while adjusting the timeline?"" This shows respect for their priorities while creating space for alternative methods.

### The Future Scenario Technique

Help them envision how current trends might affect future outcomes. Rigid thinkers often focus on past success without considering changing contexts. Gentle exploration of ""what if"" scenarios can open thinking without threatening current positions.

### Environmental Influence

Sometimes changing the physical or social environment can shift thinking more effectively than direct persuasion. Bringing in neutral third parties, changing meeting locations, or adjusting group dynamics can create openings for new ideas.

## Managing Your Own Responses 😌

Working with rigid thinkers tests your patience and communication skills. Maintain your effectiveness by:

**Separating their behavior from their worth as people.** Rigid thinking is a coping mechanism, not a character flaw. Maintaining empathy keeps interactions productive and preserves relationships.

**Managing your emotional reactions.** Their resistance isn't personal, even when it feels frustrating. Take breaks when needed and approach conversations when you're calm and centered.

**Celebrating small victories.** Acknowledge any movement toward flexibility, even if it's not the complete change you hoped for. Positive reinforcement encourages continued growth.

**Maintaining your own open-mindedness.** Sometimes rigid thinkers have valid points or important concerns. Stay curious about their perspectives while advocating for your own.

## Building Long-term Success 📈

Creating lasting change in relationships with rigid thinkers requires consistent, patient effort:

**Establish trust over time.** Demonstrate reliability, competence, and genuine care for their wellbeing. Trust creates the safety needed for intellectual flexibility.

**Model the behavior you want to see.** Show curiosity about their ideas, admit your own mistakes, and change your mind when presented with compelling evidence. Lead by example.

**Create positive associations with flexibility.** When they do show openness to new ideas, ensure the experience is rewarding rather than used as an opportunity to pile on more changes.

**Focus on relationship health over being right.** The goal isn't winning arguments but building connections that can withstand disagreements and grow stronger through respectful dialogue.

## The Ripple Effect of Your Approach 🌊

Your methods for dealing with rigid thinking don't just improve individual relationships—they create broader positive impacts:

In families, children observe and learn how to handle differences of opinion respectfully and effectively.

In workplaces, teams become more innovative and collaborative when diverse thinking is welcomed and managed skillfully.

In communities, social cohesion improves when people can navigate disagreements without damaging relationships or creating hostile divisions.

Your approach to rigid thinking becomes a model others can follow, multiplying the positive effects throughout your networks.

## Knowing When to Adjust Your Strategy 🎪

Not every situation calls for the same approach. Recognize when to modify your tactics:

**When safety is at stake,** direct intervention may be necessary regardless of relationship preservation. Some rigid thinking patterns can create genuine harm that requires immediate address.

**When time is critical,** you might need to work around rigid thinkers rather than trying to bring them along. Save relationship-building for when you have adequate time to invest.

**When patterns become abusive,** rigid thinking that crosses into controlling, manipulative, or harmful behavior requires different strategies, including possible professional help or relationship boundaries.

**When you're becoming rigid yourself,** step back and examine whether your frustration is leading you to adopt the same inflexible patterns you're trying to address in others.

## The Long View: Creating Lasting Change 🔮

Real transformation in how people think and respond to new ideas happens gradually, through accumulated positive experiences rather than dramatic confrontations. Your consistent, respectful approach plants seeds that may not germinate immediately but can grow into significant changes over months and years.

Remember that your goal isn't to eliminate all disagreement or create uniformity of thought. Healthy relationships and productive teams benefit from diverse perspectives and vigorous debate. The aim is to create environments where different ideas can be explored constructively, where people feel safe to change their minds, and where respect remains intact even during significant disagreements.

The skills you develop in working with rigid thinkers will serve you throughout your life, in relationships you haven't even formed yet and challenges you can't currently imagine. Every interaction becomes an opportunity to practice patience, empathy, strategic communication, and the kind of intellectual humility that makes growth possible for everyone involved.

*Your Ultimate Guide to Building Harmony with Difficult People*

---

## Understanding the Challenge 🎭

We all encounter them - those individuals whose emotions seem to shift like weather patterns, whose reactions feel unpredictable, and whose behavior can turn a peaceful environment into a storm zone. Whether it's a family member who explodes over minor inconveniences, a colleague who takes criticism personally, or a team member whose mood swings affect everyone's productivity, learning to navigate these relationships is one of life's most valuable skills.

The reality is simple: difficult personalities exist in every sphere of our lives. Rather than avoiding or confronting them head-on, we can develop strategies that transform challenging interactions into opportunities for growth and understanding.

## The Psychology Behind Challenging Behavior 🧠

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand what drives temperamental behavior. Most challenging personalities stem from:

**Emotional Overwhelm** 🌊
When people feel their emotions are too intense to manage, they often project these feelings outward. Understanding this helps us respond with patience rather than frustration.

**Unmet Needs** 💭
Behind every difficult behavior lies an unmet need - perhaps for recognition, security, control, or respect. Identifying these needs becomes our roadmap to resolution.

**Fear-Based Reactions** ⚡
Many temperamental responses are actually defense mechanisms. When people feel threatened or vulnerable, they may react with aggression, withdrawal, or emotional outbursts.

**Communication Gaps** 🗣️
Sometimes what appears as difficult behavior is simply poor communication skills or different communication styles clashing.

---

## The Foundation: Your Mindset Shift 🔄

**Adopt the Observer Perspective** 👁️
Instead of taking difficult behavior personally, step back and observe. Ask yourself: ""What might this person be experiencing right now?"" This simple shift transforms you from a reactive participant to a thoughtful responder.

**Embrace Emotional Intelligence** 💡
Recognize that managing challenging personalities requires high emotional intelligence - the ability to understand and manage both your emotions and theirs. This skill becomes increasingly valuable as you practice it.

**Focus on Influence, Not Control** 🎯
You cannot control another person's behavior, but you can influence the interaction's outcome through your responses. This understanding liberates you from frustration and empowers you with actionable strategies.

---

## Practical Daily Strategies 🛠️

### The CALM Method 🧘‍♂️

**C - Contain Your Reaction**
Take a deep breath before responding. Count to five if necessary. Your calm energy often de-escalates tense situations automatically.

**A - Acknowledge Their Feelings**
""I can see you're frustrated about this"" or ""It sounds like this situation is really important to you."" Acknowledgment doesn't mean agreement, but it shows respect for their emotional experience.

**L - Listen Actively**
Put away distractions and give them your full attention. Sometimes temperamental behavior stems from feeling unheard or dismissed.

**M - Move Toward Solutions**
Once emotions have been acknowledged, gently guide the conversation toward constructive outcomes: ""What would help make this better?"" or ""How can we work together on this?""

### The Boundary Setting Framework 🚧

**Crystal Clear Communication** 💎
Establish clear expectations upfront. When people know what to expect, they're less likely to react emotionally to boundaries being enforced.

**Consistent Follow-Through** ⚖️
Inconsistency breeds chaos. Whatever boundaries you set, maintain them consistently. This creates a stable environment that reduces anxiety-driven behavior.

**Natural Consequences** 🔄
Allow natural consequences to occur rather than rescuing or enabling difficult behavior. This teaches personal responsibility without creating conflict.

### The Empathy Bridge Technique 🌉

**Find Common Ground** 🤝
Despite personality differences, you likely share common goals or values. Focus conversations on these shared interests rather than differences.

**Validate Before Educating** ✅
Before offering solutions or corrections, validate their concerns. ""That sounds really challenging"" opens doors that criticism closes.

**Ask Powerful Questions** ❓
Instead of giving advice, ask questions that help them reach their own conclusions: ""What do you think might work better?"" or ""How did you handle similar situations before?""

---

## Situational Applications 🎪

### In Family Settings 🏠

**The Explosive Relative** 💥
Keep interactions short and focused. Avoid topics that trigger outbursts. When explosions occur, don't fuel the fire with arguments. Wait for calm, then address the underlying issue if appropriate.

**The Chronic Complainer** 😤
Set time limits for complaint sessions: ""I have five minutes to hear about this, then let's focus on solutions."" This prevents you from becoming an emotional dumping ground while still showing support.

**The Control Enthusiast** 🎮
Give them areas where they can have control while protecting your own autonomy. ""You handle the dinner planning, and I'll manage the entertainment"" creates win-win scenarios.

### In Professional Environments 💼

**The Moody Colleague** 🎭
Don't take their mood swings personally. Maintain consistent professionalism regardless of their emotional state. Focus on work-related interactions and avoid personal conversations during their difficult periods.

**The Credit Stealer** 🏆
Document your contributions clearly and communicate them to relevant stakeholders. Don't confront directly; instead, ensure your work speaks for itself through proper channels.

**The Micromanaging Boss** 🔍
Provide regular updates proactively to reduce their anxiety about project status. Anticipate their concerns and address them before they're raised.

### In Team Dynamics 👥

**The Negative Energy Spreader** ⚡
Counter negativity with solutions-focused language. ""That's challenging - what options do we have?"" redirects energy constructively without dismissing concerns.

**The Non-Participator** 🤐
Create safe spaces for input through one-on-one conversations or anonymous feedback systems. Some people need different forums to contribute effectively.

**The Dominating Voice** 📢
Use structured meeting formats that ensure everyone gets heard. ""Let's hear from everyone before making decisions"" creates fairness without singling anyone out.

---

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Challenges 🚀

### The Strategic Disengagement Method 🎯

Sometimes the healthiest response is strategic distance. This isn't about being rude or dismissive, but rather protecting your energy for more productive interactions.

**Professional Distance** 👔
Maintain courteous but minimal interaction. Stick to essential communications and avoid personal topics that might trigger difficult behavior.

**Emotional Boundaries** 💙
Refuse to absorb their emotional chaos. You can be compassionate without becoming their emotional support system.

**Time Management** ⏰
Limit the time you spend dealing with their issues. Set specific times for difficult conversations rather than allowing them to dominate your entire day.

### The Positive Reinforcement Approach 🌈

**Catch Them Being Good** 👍
When temperamental people behave well, acknowledge it immediately. ""I really appreciated how you handled that situation"" reinforces positive behavior.

**Create Success Opportunities** 🎯
Design situations where they can succeed and feel valued. People who feel good about themselves are less likely to create problems for others.

**Celebrate Small Wins** 🎉
Acknowledge improvements, even minor ones. ""You stayed calm during that discussion - that made a real difference"" encourages continued growth.

---

## Building Long-Term Solutions 🏗️

### The Relationship Investment Strategy 💰

**Regular Check-Ins** 📅
Schedule brief, regular conversations to address small issues before they become big problems. Prevention is always easier than cure.

**Skill Building Together** 📚
Suggest team building activities, communication workshops, or stress management resources that benefit everyone while addressing specific challenges.

**Model Desired Behavior** 🌟
Be the example of how you want to be treated. Consistent modeling often influences others to adopt similar approaches over time.

### Creating Supportive Systems 🔧

**Team Agreements** 📋
Establish group norms for communication, conflict resolution, and mutual respect. When everyone agrees to standards, accountability becomes easier.

**Regular Feedback Loops** 🔄
Create safe opportunities for people to express concerns before they explode. Anonymous suggestion boxes or regular team retrospectives can prevent major blowups.

**Resource Access** 📖
Make stress management tools, communication guides, and conflict resolution resources easily available to everyone.

---

## When Professional Help is Needed 🆘

Recognize when challenging behavior crosses the line into potentially harmful territory:

- **Consistent Verbal Aggression** 🗯️
- **Threats or Intimidation** ⚠️
- **Behavior That Affects Others' Mental Health** 🧠
- **Violations of Legal or Company Policies** ⚖️

In these cases, involving HR, management, or professional counselors becomes necessary for everyone's wellbeing.

---

## Measuring Your Success 📊

Track your progress in handling difficult personalities through these indicators:

**Personal Peace** ☮️
You feel less stressed and more confident when interacting with challenging people.

**Improved Outcomes** 📈
Conflicts resolve more quickly and with better results for everyone involved.

**Relationship Quality** 💖
Even difficult relationships show signs of improvement over time.

**Team Dynamics** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

On my WFH days, the 2–3 PM crash used to tank my call energy and note quality—FNOL follow-ups felt twice as hard, and my documentation took longer. I tried powering through, extra coffee, even quick naps—none stuck. 

A month ago I actually tracked what I was doing and made four small changes that finally worked >>>

What stuck:

	1.	10-min outside walk right after lunch. Fresh air + a little sun resets me fast—bck at my desk in ~12 mins. 🌤️

	2.	Standing “outbound sprint” from ~2:30. I stand for 30–45 mins while knocking out callbacks and voicemails. More energy on the phone, fewer “uh… let me check” moments.

	3.	Mornings = heavy cognitive work. Coverage reads, trickier liability calls, and longer write-ups before noon. Afternoons = lighter flow (vendor coordination, status updates, closing clean files). Fewer next-day rewrites.

	4.	Lighter lunch + a 2PM water reminder. Protein + veggies instead of pasta/sandwich and chips = way less fog. A simple timer keeps me sipping.

- - -

What flopped:

	•	20-min nap → woke up dull and slower on the first call back.

	•	“One more coffee” → mini high, bigger crash.
	•	Forcing a gnarly coverage determination at 3PM → more errors to fix later.

	•	Sugary snack → short bost, then focus dip.

How I measured:

	•	Time-to-first completed note after lunch (min).

	•	Rework on my notes the next morning. 

	•	Subjective energy 1–5 at 2:30 PM.

	•	Live connects vs. voicemails during the 2:30–3:30 block.

- - -

Questions for other adjusters/phone-heavy roles:

	•	Do you batch outbound calls after lunch or interleave with docs? What cadence keeps you steady?

	•	If you do your hardest reviews after 3PM, what setup/ritual makes that work?

	•	Any lunches that keep you level without the 2:30 crash?",2,1756598942.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

1n4ghzr,https://i.redd.it/w73wypovx8mf1.png,IBHCC Tabletop Proof-of-Concept Model - Revealing the Hidden 70%,"*This is an excerpt from Chapter 29, taken from the full comprehensive draft of ""From Waste to Abundance,"" which is currently available exclusively on the Discord community.*

This guide details the construction and operation of a small-scale, functional model of the Integrated Biomass-Hydro Combined Cascade (IBHCC) system. Its purpose is to provide a safe, visual, and intuitive demonstration that reveals a shocking truth: every conventional power plant on Earth is throwing away more energy than it captures. The entire apparatus can be safely operated on a standard picnic table or workbench, progressing from simple to advanced configurations that prove a single integrated system could potentially replace all essential community infrastructure.

### The Revolutionary Observation

Before diving into construction, understand what this demonstration proves. Conventional power plants extract about 30% of a fuel's energy and discard the remaining 70% as ""waste heat"" and uncaptured matter. This tabletop model makes that waste visible and then demonstrates how the IBHCC captures and multiplies it into more power than the original extraction. A symbolic pinwheel will represent what everyone else settles for; the blazing LED at the end represents the abundance they throw away.

1. Components & Materials
The model is designed to be built from simple, accessible materials that effectively simulate their full-scale counterparts. (Refer to the Diagram for a visual representation of the complete assembly.)

 * Primary Heat Source: A miniature, ashless camping pellet stove is ideal to serve as the crucible. Alternatively, a laboratory hot plate can be used.

 * Boiler (Steam Source): A borosilicate glass flask with a side-arm for water return. This flask's sole purpose is to boil water and create the initial stream of steam.

 * Re-vaporizer Flask (Heat Exchanger): A separate, sealed metal hip flask. This flask contains no water. Its purpose is to act as a high-temperature heat exchanger. Superheated air is pumped through it to make its outer surface incredibly hot.

 * Superheated Air System:

   * Hot Air Pump: A standard hairdryer set to ""cool"" serves as the primary fan.

   * Primary Air Heating Coil: A length of copper tubing coiled to fit directly within the crucible. The hairdryer pumps ambient air through this coil, superheating it before it enters the Re-vaporizer Flask.

   * Insulated Air Ducting: The copper tubing continues from the coil. It is crucial that this tubing is wrapped in standard pipe insulation along its entire length, except for the specific points of heat transfer.

 * Symbolic Re-heating Burners: Small alcohol burners. These represent the ability to use internally produced biofuels (from coffee pellets, etc.) to add more energy into the system.

 * Ascension Silo & Condenser: A 2-3 foot long, clear tube. The top is fitted with an elbow bend containing several metal sink screens to act as the condenser.

 * Cold Air System:

   * Cold Air Pump: A second hairdryer, also set to ""cool.""

   * Ice Pit Simulator: An insulated cooler filled with ice. The hairdryer pumps air through this cooler to create a steady stream of cold air.

 * Heron Fountain Assembly: Comprised of a large top Reservoir Tank (bottle), a smaller, durable metal or glass Side Tank (to withstand direct heat), a threaded plumbing T joint, silicone tubing, two-way control valves. Placement of the feeder tube may need to be adjusted, as the hot air’s expansion may necessitate placement closer to the entrance / exit valve rather than the rear air pocket.

 * Turbine & Generator: A 3D-printed Pelton wheel connected to a small DC motor and an LED.

 * Symbolic Turbine: A lightweight paper or foil pinwheel.

2. Assembly & Priming
Assembly follows a logical sequence to demonstrate the progression from waste to wealth.

 * Heat Source & Boiler: Position the air heating coil inside the pellet stove. Place the borosilicate boiler flask on top.

 * Re-vaporizer Assembly: Place the metal Re-vaporizer Flask after the symbolic pinwheel's location. Connect the outlet of the air heating coil to the inlet of this flask. The outlet of the flask will become the start of your insulated hot air ducting.

 * Steam Path: Insert the Ascension Silo into the top of the boiler flask. The path for the steam is: Boiler -> Ascension Silo -> Symbolic Pinwheel -> Exterior of Re-vaporizer Flask -> Condenser.

 * Hot Air Path: Route the insulated hot air ducting from the Re-vaporizer Flask outlet so that it makes direct contact with the Ascension Silo and the Heron Fountain's Side Tank. Use the ""Half-Moon"" insulation cut (removing only the bottom half of the insulation at contact points) to maximize heat transfer while minimizing loss.

 * Cold Air Path: Position the cold air pump to blow through the ice chest. Duct the resulting cold air so that it blows both across the condenser screens and into the back of the elbow bend. This dual injection creates a powerful downdraft that forces the steam through the condenser.

 * Priming: Prime the water system as described previously, ensuring the Heron Fountain is fully primed with its valves closed before beginning the demonstration.

3. Step-by-Step Energy Demonstration

Step 1: The Topping Cycle (Conventional Waste)

 * Action: Heat the boiler. Observe the lightweight pinwheel spinning from the initial steam pressure.

 * Observation: The pinwheel turns steadily.

 * Key Message: ""This spinning pinwheel represents the entire output of a conventional power plant—roughly 30% of the fuel's energy. This is what they consider success. Everything that gets past this point is the 'waste' we are going to use.""

Step 2: Flash Re-Vaporization (The First Waste Capture)

 * Action: Activate the hot air pump. Superheated air now flows through the Re-vaporizer Flask, making its surface intensely hot.

 * Observation: The lower-energy steam coming off the pinwheel crackles and surges as it hits the hot flask, instantly re-energizing and rising up the silo with new vigor.

 * Key Message: ""We are now using waste heat, transported by air, to flash re-vaporize the steam. We've just boosted our working fluid for free, using energy that is normally thrown away.""

Step 3: The Bottoming Cycle & Thermal Supercharging

 * Action: Allow the re-energized steam to condense and run the Heron Fountain:
Let the top tank fill up with water and air before releasing the first valve
Once the first valve opens, the side tank will fill. Once it reaches 60-80% fill open the second valve to eject the water from the precision nozzle 
Once the flow is achieved, the passive feeder tube’s valve can be opened, the vacuum created from the side tank draining will continually suck water from the top tank (the valve can be adjusted to enhance or retard flow as needed).

The hot air ducting is actively heating the fountain's Side Tank.

 * Observation: The Pelton wheel spins and the LED blazes with intense brightness.

 * Key Message: ""This blazing light is powered entirely by their waste, which we have captured, re-energized, and multiplied. This is the true power of the IBHCC.""

## IBHCC Tabletop Demo Order of Operations

24. **Pressurized Return Flow** - Enhanced flow back to boiler
25. **Fresh Water Collection** - Optional tap for distilled water extraction
26. **Water Return to Boiler** - Complete the closed loop, supplement at step 4


4. Demonstrating the Six Services of a Single Fire
This model proves the IBHCC isn't just a power plant; it's a complete infrastructure engine providing six (or more) essential services from a single heat source.

 * Electricity: Demonstrated by the brightly lit LED on the main turbine.

 * Heated Air/Climate Control: The stream of hot air from the primary heating coil can be vented to demonstrate space heating.

 * Chilled Air/Climate Control: The stream of cold air from the ice pit simulator can be vented to demonstrate air conditioning.

 * Water Services (Fresh, Pumping, Treatment): If saltwater is used in the boiler, the condensed water is fresh, demonstrating energy-positive desalination. By adding a Y-junction to the final water output, you can show how this water can be diverted to a remote waypoint station, demonstrating the system's ability to act as a pumping station for brine or treated water (simulating partial sewage treatment).

 * Liquid Fuel: The symbolic alcohol burners represent the liquid biofuels that the full-scale system creates, another ""free"" energy source for direct application.

 * Pneumatic Transport: The exhaust from the hot air system can be used to show how pneumatic devices or even a small tube transport system could be powered, demonstrating the potential for a zero-energy material logistics network.

This comprehensive demonstration proves that one integrated system can replace the electric grid, the municipal water supply, gas lines, HVAC systems, fuel depots, and even local freight transport.

5. The Development Pathway: From Bonfire to Automation

This section details the most crucial aspect of the IBHCC's accessibility: its evolutionary design. The system can be initiated with ancient technology and then upgraded over time as a community gains resources and skills.

Stage 1: The Low-Tech Initiator

The entire system can be initiated without advanced technology.

 * The Primal Heat Source: Instead of a pellet stove, the process can begin with a simple, large, enclosed clay-kiln bonfire. The boiler is placed directly over this intense heat source.

 * Manual Priming: Once the boiler plate is sufficiently hot, the system is primed by manually pouring water onto the surface. It instantly flashes into steam, which rises into the Ascension Silo and begins the condensation and collection process.

Stage 2: The First Major Upgrade (Automating the System)

The manual priming phase is temporary. A more elegant and robust upgrade path is to build a small, simple steam engine.

 * Application: The initial steam from the boiler, which was turning the symbolic pinwheel, is now routed to power this small steam engine.

 * Automation: The mechanical output of the steam engine is then used, via a series of belts and pulleys, to directly power the two fans (hairdryers) for the hot and cold air systems.

 * The Result: The entire system's auxiliary components are now automated directly by the primary steam cycle. The ""waste"" steam from this engine's exhaust is then sent to the Re-vaporizer Flask to continue its journey, ensuring no energy is lost.

Stage 3: The Network Effect & Remote Activation
The true power of the IBHCC is realized when multiple systems are interconnected.

 * The Network Effect: A primary facility, such as a coastal desalination plant, can use its immense surplus of energy and pressure to pump both fresh water and brine inland to other facilities through a network of waypoint pumping stations. This allows for the replenishment of watersheds and the creation of inland marine ecosystems.

 * Flexible Fuel for a Flexible Network: The biorefinery process within a primary facility creates liquid biofuels. This fuel is not just for internal use; it is a portable, high-density energy source. It can be easily transported (even via the pneumatic tube network) to any waypoint station in the system. This means a remote pumping station can be kick-started or boosted using this fuel, providing incredible flexibility and resilience to the entire network.

 * Alternative Remote Power: For facilities with more means or in high-sun areas, these remote waypoint pumps could also be retrofitted with simple solar panels and electric heating pads instead of biofuel burners. This would allow them to use solar energy to provide the thermal supercharging for the Heron fountain, further decentralizing the energy inputs of the network.

## Waypoint Station Order of Operations

**Water Relay System (Simplified IBHCC Units)**

1. **Pressurized Water Input** - High-pressure water arrives from upstream station via pipe
2. **Collection Tank Fill** - Water fills elevated storage tank at waypoint
3. **Air Spring Formation** - Rising water compresses air pocket above
4. **Tank Full Signal** - Collection tank reaches capacity
5. **Prime Heron Fountain** - Open valve, water flows to side tank
6. **Side Tank Fill** - Fill to 60-75% capacity 
7. **Thermal Supercharging** - Liquid fuel (biodiesel/bio-oil) heats side tank air pocket
8. **Pressure Amplification** - Heated air exponentially increases water pressure
9. **Nozzle Release** - Open precision valve for high-velocity jet
10. **Pipe Transport** - Water shoots through transport pipe to next waypoint
11. **Repeat Cycle** - Next station repeats process, extending transport range

**Key Differences from Main System:**
- No power generation (no Pelton wheel/LED)
- Water flows straight through pipes instead of hitting turbines
- Each station extends transport range while maintaining pressure
- Liquid fuel keeps pressure amplification running at each waypoint
- Network can transport water hundreds of miles using only the original energy input

## Waypoint Network Applications

**Ecological Restoration:**
- **Desert Reclamation** - Transport seawater inland for controlled salt marsh creation and gradual soil remediation
- **Watershed Replenishment** - Pump water uphill to restore dried river systems and aquifers
- **Wildfire Prevention** - Create strategic water reserves in fire-prone areas for rapid deployment

**Agricultural Systems:**
- **Inland Aquaculture** - Transport seawater for marine fish farming hundreds of miles from coast
- **Precision Irrigation** - Deliver water exactly where needed without energy-consuming pump systems
- **Soil Remediation** - Transport treated water for healing damaged farmland

**Industrial Applications:**
- **Mining Site Restoration** - Pump clean water to remediate contaminated sites
- **Manufacturing** - Supply industrial processes with pressurized water without grid dependency
- **Cooling Systems** - Provide industrial cooling water using transport network pressure

**Emergency Response:**
- **Disaster Relief** - Rapidly establish water supply to disaster-affected areas
- **Remote Communities** - Connect isolated areas to reliable water networks
- **Strategic Reserves** - Create distributed water storage for regional resilience

## Network Interconnection & System Regeneration

**Full IBHCC Integration Points:**
- **System Re-energization** - Waypoint water can be directed into full IBHCC facilities downstream, where it gets completely re-energized through the full dual-system process
- **Water Addition** - Each full IBHCC system adds new water to the network (from seawater, groundwater, atmospheric water generation, etc.)
- **Pressure Restoration** - Full systems restore and amplify pressure for continued long-distance transport
- **Multi-Source Integration** - Network can draw from multiple water sources as it expands

**Network Multiplication Effect:**
Instead of water pressure gradually declining over distance, the network actually **gains capacity** as it grows. Each full IBHCC facility acts as both a destination and a regeneration point, taking in water from the transport network while simultaneously adding new water and pressure from local sources.

**Continental-Scale Implications:**
A coastal desalination IBHCC could pump water inland through waypoint stations to reach inland IBHCC facilities powered by local biomass. Those inland systems add river water or groundwater to the network while re-pressurizing the flow for further transport. The network becomes **self-reinforcing** - each addition makes the whole system more powerful and capable.

This creates a **cascade amplification effect** where the network's transport capacity grows exponentially rather than declining with distance, enabling truly continental-scale water management and ecological restoration using only the waste heat that conventional systems throw away.

The network transforms from simple point-to-point transport into a **living infrastructure system** that gets stronger and more capable as it expands.

## System Scaling & Universal Retrofit Potential

**Scalable Development Path:**
The IBHCC scales systematically from homestead (50-200 lbs coffee waste daily) to community (2-4 parallel systems) to industrial installations (6-12+ parallel arrays). Each scale maintains the same fundamental principles while increasing capacity through proven parallel multiplication.

**Universal Retrofit Applications:**
The waste heat recovery system can be retrofitted to virtually any existing thermal facility - coal plants, natural gas facilities, industrial processes, even oil refineries. Any facility with a steam stack becomes a candidate for IBHCC enhancement while maintaining existing baseline operations.

**Hydroelectric Plant Integration:**
Existing hydroelectric facilities present particularly elegant retrofit opportunities. The dam's water flow replaces the elevated storage tanks, requiring only addition of Heron Fountain pressure multiplication and precision nozzle systems. A portion of the dam's flow gets diverted through the pressure multiplication system, then delivered at higher velocity for enhanced turbine impact. Thermal supercharging can be powered by the plant's own electricity through electric heating coils rather than biodiesel, creating a fuel-free enhancement loop that increases total power output from the same water flow.

## Learning from Past Failures: The Salton Sea Lessons

The IBHCC's water management systems benefit from studying previous artificial water body failures. The Salton Sea in California demonstrates what happens when water systems lack proper engineering controls.

Created accidentally in 1905 when the Colorado River flooded California's Salton Basin, the Salton Sea initially became a recreational paradise attracting celebrities and luxury resorts. However, fundamental design flaws created environmental disaster:

- **No outlet strategy** caused dissolved salts to concentrate until salinity exceeded ocean levels
- **Uncontrolled agricultural runoff** created toxic algae blooms and massive fish die-offs  
- **Unlined basin** allowed contamination and geological instability

**IBHCC Solutions:** The system's condensation process creates pure distilled water, eliminating salt accumulation. Coffee-ash concrete liners provide permanent containment, while biological filtration through spirulina systems maintains water quality. Unlike single-purpose recreation, IBHCC systems provide energy, waste processing, and food production - creating permanent community value with multiple revenue streams.

## Addressing Institutional Skepticism

**The Cost Reality:** The IBHCC is fundamentally cheaper than conventional power plants being built today. It uses simpler core technologies (biomass gasifiers vs nuclear reactors) and produces its own building materials during operation, reducing infrastructure costs from 40-60% down to 5-10% of total project cost. No hidden subsidies, loan guarantees, or insurance backstops required.

**Scalable Implementation:** This isn't an ""all or nothing"" system. Start with homestead-scale units buildable without advanced expertise, then scale using materials the system produces. A small installation continuously creates ash for concrete, waste heat for curing insulation, and steam for processing structural materials - enabling organic growth impossible for other power systems.

**The Thermodynamics Question:** This isn't energy from nothing - it's strategic utilization of the complete biomass feedstock. The solid portion powers the base steam cycle, while liquid biofuels (from the same source material) provide targeted heating throughout the waste recovery system. Combined with pressure amplification from trapped air expansion and gravity-assisted water cycling, the total system extracts significantly more energy from the same fuel input than conventional single-cycle systems.

Think of it as two integrated systems: System 1 (conventional steam) provides baseline power, while System 2 (waste recovery) captures and redirects energy that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere.

**Energy Balance Reality:** The auxiliary equipment (fans, pumps) does consume power, but this comes from the system's own electrical output - similar to how power plants use a portion of their generation for plant operations. The net gain comes from capturing waste heat that conventional plants vent directly to cooling towers or exhaust stacks.

**Why This Works:** Conventional thermal plants achieve ~30-40% efficiency because they operate as single-cycle systems. Combined-cycle plants (gas turbine + steam recovery) already prove that capturing ""waste"" from the first cycle can significantly boost total efficiency. The IBHCC extends this principle further by adding thermal storage, pressure amplification, and multiple heat recovery stages.

**Water Security Backstop:** Even if energy claims prove optimistic, the system provides energy-positive desalination using waste heat that's already being produced. This makes freshwater production essentially cost-free, providing enormous value through water security alone.

## The Steam Engine's Last Stand

While humanity invests hundreds of billions in fusion research - attempting to recreate stellar nuclear fires in magnetic bottles cooled to near absolute zero - the ultimate goal remains unchanged: heating water to create steam that spins turbines. We're building the most sophisticated machines in human history to accomplish what steam engines have done for centuries.

This raises a fundamental question: if our most advanced energy technology still depends on steam turbines, have we truly optimized steam systems to their limits? While brilliant minds contain plasma at 100 million degrees, we routinely discard 70% of thermal energy from every power plant as ""waste heat.""

The IBHCC suggests extraordinary performance may be achievable through systematic application of principles we've understood for millennia - thermal expansion, pressure multiplication, gravitational storage, and waste recovery - rather than requiring breakthrough physics decades away from practical application.

## The Undeniable Conclusion

When observers see that lonely pinwheel—representing everything conventional plants achieve—spinning above a system where the main LED blazes from the ""waste,"" where remote pumping stations can be powered by internally-produced fuel, the implications are staggering. This tabletop model proves that revolutionary infrastructure isn't about impossible technology; it's about intelligent engineering applied to the systematic waste we've accepted as normal. The only question remaining is not if this works, but how quickly we can scale it.

*How to build bridges instead of walls with those who struggle socially*

---

We've all encountered them. That colleague who interrupts conversations without realizing it. The family member who makes uncomfortable comments at gatherings. The teammate who seems oblivious to social cues that everyone else picks up naturally. These individuals aren't malicious - they're simply navigating the world with a different social compass.

Rather than writing them off or avoiding them, let's explore practical ways to create meaningful connections that benefit everyone involved.

## Understanding the Challenge 🧠

Social skills aren't distributed equally. Just as some people are naturally gifted at mathematics while others struggle with basic calculations, social intelligence varies dramatically from person to person. Some individuals genuinely don't perceive the subtle signals that guide most social interactions - the raised eyebrow that says ""change the subject,"" the slight step backward that indicates someone needs space, or the polite smile that masks discomfort.

This isn't about intelligence or character. Many socially awkward individuals excel in other areas - they might be brilliant problem-solvers, creative thinkers, or incredibly loyal friends once you get to know them.

## The Foundation: Empathy Over Frustration 💡

The first step in any successful relationship with socially challenged individuals is shifting your mindset from frustration to understanding. Instead of thinking ""Why don't they get it?"" try ""They're doing their best with the tools they have.""

This perspective change isn't just about being nice - it's strategically smart. When you approach someone with curiosity rather than irritation, they're more likely to be receptive to guidance and less likely to become defensive.

## Clear Communication is Your Superpower 🎯

Most social miscues happen because of unclear expectations. With socially awkward individuals, explicit communication becomes essential:

**Instead of:** ""We should probably wrap this up soon.""
**Try:** ""I need to leave in five minutes to make my next appointment.""

**Instead of:** Hoping they'll notice you're busy
**Try:** ""I'm focused on this deadline right now. Can we talk at 3 PM instead?""

**Instead of:** Getting frustrated when they dominate conversations
**Try:** ""I'd love to hear Sarah's thoughts on this too.""

Direct communication feels awkward at first if you're used to subtle hints, but it eliminates confusion and creates clearer boundaries for everyone.

## The Power of Positive Reinforcement 🌟

When socially awkward individuals do something well socially, acknowledge it. Not in a patronizing way, but genuinely. ""Thanks for asking how my presentation went - that meant a lot"" or ""I appreciated you including everyone in that discussion.""

This feedback helps them understand which behaviors work well, creating a positive learning loop. Remember, they often can't tell when they're getting it right any more than they can tell when they're getting it wrong.

## Set Boundaries Without Building Walls 🚧

Boundaries aren't mean - they're necessary for healthy relationships. With socially challenged individuals, you might need to be more explicit about your limits:

""I enjoy our chats, but I can't talk during my lunch break because that's my recharge time.""

""I'm happy to help you problem-solve, but I can only do it for 15 minutes right now.""

""I value our friendship, and I need you to know that interrupting makes me feel unheard.""

Clear boundaries actually make relationships safer and more sustainable for both parties.

## Practical Daily Strategies 📋

**In Family Settings:**
- Give them specific roles at gatherings where they can contribute successfully
- Prepare them for social situations by explaining expectations beforehand
- Create one-on-one time where they can be themselves without social pressure

**At Work:**
- Send meeting agendas in advance so they can prepare
- Use written communication for complex instructions
- Pair them with socially skilled teammates for collaborative projects

**In Friendships:**
- Choose activities that play to their strengths
- Be explicit about plans and timing
- Don't take their social mistakes personally

## Managing Your Own Energy 🔋

Supporting socially awkward individuals can be emotionally taxing. You might find yourself constantly translating social situations or managing awkward moments. This is normal, but it's important to:

- Take breaks from being the social interpreter
- Find other relationships where you can be spontaneous
- Remember that you can't fix someone else's social skills - only support them
- Practice self-compassion when interactions don't go smoothly

## The Long Game: Building Trust and Understanding 🏗️

Meaningful relationships with socially awkward individuals often develop slowly. They may need time to trust that you won't judge or reject them for their social differences. Once that trust is established, you'll often find they're incredibly loyal, honest, and grateful for your patience.

Many successful collaborations happen when socially skilled individuals partner with those who think differently. The key is focusing on strengths rather than trying to fix weaknesses.

## When to Seek Additional Support 🆘

Sometimes social awkwardness stems from underlying conditions or circumstances that benefit from professional support. If someone's social struggles are severely impacting their life or relationships, gently suggesting resources like:

- Communication skills workshops
- Social skills groups
- Professional counseling
- Books or online resources about social interaction

can be helpful. Frame these suggestions as tools for growth rather than fixes for problems.

## Creating Inclusive Environments 🌈

Whether in families, workplaces, or friend groups, we can create environments where socially awkward individuals thrive:

- Establish clear group norms and expectations
- Rotate speaking opportunities in meetings
- Use icebreakers that don't require spontaneous wit
- Celebrate different types of contributions
- Address exclusionary behavior when you see it

## The Unexpected Benefits 🎁

Working successfully with socially awkward individuals often brings unexpected rewards:

- They often provide honest, unfiltered feedback that's incredibly valuable
- Their different perspective can lead to creative solutions
- They're typically very direct, which can be refreshing
- Once they trust you, they're often exceptionally loyal
- They can teach you patience and clear communication skills

## Moving Forward Together 🚀

Building successful relationships with socially awkward individuals isn't about changing them - it's about creating connection despite different social styles. It requires patience, clear communication, and the wisdom to focus on character rather than social polish.

These relationships, when nurtured properly, often become some of the most authentic and rewarding connections we have. They remind us that social grace isn't the only measure of a person's worth and that meaningful connection transcends perfect etiquette.

The next time you encounter someone who seems socially out of step, consider it an opportunity rather than an obstacle. You might discover that beneath the awkward exterior lies someone worth knowing - someone who will enrich your life in ways you never expected.

Remember: we all have areas where we struggle and areas where we shine. Creating space for different types of people doesn't just help them - it creates a richer, more interesting world for all of us.

---

**Final Thought:** The goal isn't to create a world where everyone is socially smooth. The goal is to create a world where everyone can contribute their unique gifts, regardless of their social packaging. That's a world worth working toward, one conversation at a time. ✨

This team wasn't just a team to me. My dad had had season tickets to them ever since they came into the league. Never has missed a home game. My parents met at a hockey game. My dad and I bonded over sports. I wanted to go into sports broadcasting. I did for a little while, and then pursued other options. 

Years later I became very lucky and was able to do marketing and promotions for our hometown team that I've loved. I wasn't a puck bunny as what usually females are called who just like the game to watch the men. I know my hockey backwards and forwards. I can handle an amazing hockey conversation. I actually had my own radio show for a while on just a no name AM radio station. 

Anyways this team's DNA ran through my soul. My life revolved around them for the longest time. I was able to attend every home game. I was able to sell raffle tickets for charity. But I also made money. It wasn't great money but it helped to pay some bills. But the thing was I got to interact with fans and that kept me going. This job kept me going through some of the deepest, darkest times in my life. 

Then the old boss got fired and they brought in a man to run the group of us. I was the top seller I had been for 3 years and he restructured the group but he kept me girls that I'd worked with for over 3 years we're gone. It was really upsetting but he was able to do that. Then harassment begin. Telling me that I could not work games unless I sent him photographs. Then the inappropriate comments happened. I don't want to post too much here just please trust me it was absolutely morbid and disgusting. He even held team events at his house with his wife who also worked for the team and I was roofied not once but twice and luckily one of the older women there who adored me watch out for me. I drove with her both times because she had overheard the manager talking that he and his wife are going to take advantage of me. Sexually. 

I'm leaving some details out of this because if I give away too much information people will easily know who it is. So one day the higher up manager from the hockey team came up to me and said that he had her some of the girls complaining that the manager of the raffle tickets was making sexual advances and asking for photos and talking nasty to the girls he asked me if they said happened to me I said yes. He then asked me if I was willing to talk to a lawyer. He said I would be saving the team because if this ever made the news the team would be ruined. He knew that I bled for this team I lived for this team. He knew about my family and how much this team meant to me. I said yes I would so I went to the attorney and I spoke to them I just closed everything that had happened including the photos and emails. Text messages were documented. 

This happened in the off season so the manager was not invited back. 

I worked for them another year and a half. They ended up getting rid of me in the beginning of the next new season. No reason why. No emails, no messages. Just ghosted. 

So the pervert manager messages me about 6 months ago. Wanting to get together and stop by my apartment. Well I said first of all I don't even live there anymore. I didn't respond to him any longer. 

He messaged me again about a week ago. Wanting to get together for coffee. I turned him down. At that point I asked him about what happened with the job. He told me he was paid off by the team. With a very generous severance package.


I was treated as a hero for maybe a short week but I completely lost my income when I was let go from there and this man gets a severance package? He gets paid for sexually harassing girls? I'm only going to leave this up we're very short time. I need to be very careful but please message me. Forgive me I'm using talk to text when I talk about this it gets very upsetting for me and I start shaking very badly. I can't type at that point so that is why I'm using talk to text. Thank you for making this a safe space to where we can come and talk about this. I'm just very worried that someone will read this and I will give away my identity.

*Every group has one. That person who responds to fresh thinking with a predictable ""But that won't work because..."" They're the human equivalent of a wet blanket on the campfire of creativity. Let's call them what they are: Idea-Killers.*

## Recognizing the Pattern 🔍

You know them instantly. When someone suggests a new approach, they immediately list seventeen reasons why it's doomed. When a colleague proposes an innovative solution, they counter with ""We tried something similar in 1987, and it failed."" Their default response to possibility is impossibility.

These individuals don't necessarily intend harm. Often, they believe they're being helpful by pointing out potential problems. But their consistent negativity creates an atmosphere where new thinking suffocates before it can breathe.

## The Psychology Behind the Behavior 🧠

Understanding why people become Idea-Killers helps us respond more effectively. Several factors drive this behavior:

**Fear of Change**: New ideas threaten the status quo. For someone comfortable with existing systems, innovation feels like unnecessary disruption.

**Risk Aversion**: They focus exclusively on what could go wrong, unable to see potential benefits. Their mental spotlight illuminates only the pitfalls.

**Past Disappointments**: Previous failures with new initiatives create a protective shell of skepticism. They've been burned before and refuse to get close to the fire again.

**Need for Control**: Shooting down ideas maintains their position as the voice of reason, the practical one who keeps everyone's feet on the ground.

**Perfectionism**: If an idea isn't flawless from the start, they reject it entirely rather than considering how it might evolve.

## The Real Cost of Idea-Killing 💸

When creativity dies in meetings, everyone loses. Innovation stagnates. Problems remain unsolved. Team members stop contributing, knowing their suggestions will face immediate criticism. The organization becomes stuck in old patterns while competitors surge ahead.

On a personal level, constant negativity drains energy from relationships. Family dinners become exercises in defending every suggestion. Office brainstorming sessions turn into battles of attrition.

## Strategic Responses That Actually Work ⚡

### 1. The Redirect Method

Instead of arguing with their objections, redirect the conversation toward solutions. When they say ""That won't work because of X,"" respond with ""Interesting point about X. How might we address that challenge while moving forward?""

This acknowledges their concern without letting it derail progress. You're not dismissing their input; you're channeling it constructively.

### 2. The Evidence Approach

Idea-Killers often make sweeping statements without backing them up. Gently request specifics: ""What data are you basing that on?"" or ""Can you help me understand exactly why you think that's the case?""

This isn't confrontational—it's collaborative. You're asking them to be your research partner rather than your opponent.

### 3. The Small Steps Strategy

Large ideas trigger stronger resistance. Break your proposal into smaller, less threatening components. Instead of ""Let's completely redesign our morning routine,"" try ""What if we shifted breakfast thirty minutes later tomorrow and see how it feels?""

Incremental change feels safer and gives Idea-Killers less ammunition for objection.

### 4. The Pre-emptive Partnership

Before presenting an idea, privately share it with the Idea-Killer. Ask for their input in refining it. This transforms them from critic to collaborator. They'll be less likely to shoot down something they helped develop.

### 5. The Timing Tactic

Some people are more receptive at certain times. Maybe they're more open to new ideas in the morning, or after lunch, or at the end of the week. Pay attention to their patterns and time your proposals accordingly.

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Cases 🛠️

### The Documentation Method

Start keeping track of their objections and the actual outcomes when ideas move forward despite their resistance. This creates a factual record that can be referenced later: ""Remember when you were concerned about the expense of the new software? It actually saved us money within three months.""

### The Question Framework

Transform statements into questions. Instead of ""We should try this new approach,"" ask ""What would need to be true for this approach to succeed?"" This engages their analytical nature constructively.

### The Devil's Advocate Assignment

Formally assign them the role of identifying potential problems—but with the caveat that for every problem they identify, they must also suggest a possible solution. This harnesses their critical thinking while requiring constructive contribution.

### The Success Story Strategy

Share examples of similar ideas that worked elsewhere. Idea-Killers often respond to concrete evidence better than abstract possibilities. ""Company Y implemented something similar and saw a 40% improvement in efficiency.""

## Building Idea-Friendly Environments 🌱

### Set Clear Expectations

Establish ground rules for discussions. ""For the first ten minutes, we'll generate ideas without evaluation. Then we'll spend time refining them."" This prevents premature criticism from killing concepts before they're fully formed.

### Create Safe Spaces

Designate specific times and places for creative thinking where criticism is temporarily suspended. This might be a weekly innovation hour or a monthly brainstorming session with explicit ""yes, and"" rules.

### Reward Risk-Taking

Celebrate attempts at innovation, even when they don't succeed perfectly. This encourages more people to contribute ideas and shows Idea-Killers that failure isn't catastrophic.

### Lead by Example

Demonstrate openness to new suggestions, even imperfect ones. When you respond enthusiastically to ideas—particularly unconventional ones—you set a tone that others will follow.

## When You're the Idea-Killer 🪞

Sometimes we're our own worst enemy. If you recognize Idea-Killer tendencies in yourself, here's how to evolve:

### Practice the Pause

When you hear a new idea, resist the urge to immediately identify problems. Take a breath and ask yourself, ""What's interesting about this?"" before jumping to criticism.

### Adopt the Build Mindset

Instead of ""Yes, but..."" try ""Yes, and..."" This simple linguistic shift changes your mental approach from tearing down to building up.

### Seek the Kernel

Look for the valuable core in every suggestion, even flawed ones. Often, bad ideas contain seeds of good ones. Your job is to water those seeds, not poison them.

### Question Your Questions

Before voicing an objection, ask yourself: ""Am I raising this concern to help improve the idea, or to shut it down?"" Your motivation determines whether your input is constructive or destructive.

## Long-Term Relationship Management 📈

Dealing with chronic Idea-Killers requires patience and persistence. Here's your sustainable approach:

### Maintain Perspective

Remember that their resistance often comes from genuine concern, not malice. They might be protecting the group from genuinely bad ideas—even if their methods are flawed.

### Pick Your Battles

Not every idea needs to be defended to the death. Save your energy for concepts that truly matter. Sometimes letting them win small victories makes them more receptive to bigger changes later.

### Build Alliances

Identify others who support innovative thinking. When presenting ideas, ensure you have backup voices ready to contribute positive perspectives. Idea-Killers are less effective when outnumbered by enthusiasm.

### Document Progress

Keep track of successful implementations despite their initial resistance. Over time, this evidence helps shift their default response from ""no"" to ""maybe.""

## The Workplace Application 💼

In professional settings, Idea-Killers can particularly damage team dynamics. Here are workplace-specific strategies:

### Meeting Management

Structure meetings to separate idea generation from evaluation. Use techniques like silent brainstorming (where everyone writes ideas before sharing) to prevent immediate criticism from stifling creativity.

### Project Phases

Build evaluation phases into your project timeline. This gives Idea-Killers a designated time and place to voice concerns while protecting the creative phase.

### Role Clarity

Sometimes Idea-Killers emerge because roles aren't clear. If someone thinks their job is to prevent mistakes, they'll focus on finding problems. Clarify that innovation requires calculated risks.

### Performance Metrics

Include collaboration and openness to new ideas in performance evaluations. This sends a clear message that constant negativity isn't valued behavior.

## Family and Personal Relationships 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

When the Idea-Killer is your spouse, parent, or close friend, the stakes feel higher. Here's how to preserve relationships while protecting creativity:

### Private Conversations

Address the pattern directly but privately. ""I've noticed that when I suggest trying new things, your first response is usually to explain why they won't work. I'd love to hear your thoughts after we've had a chance to explore possibilities together.""

### Emotional Validation

Acknowledge their concerns while maintaining your position. ""I understand you're worried about wasting money/time/energy. That's a valid concern. Can we figure out a way to test this idea that feels safer to you?""

### Compromise Solutions

Find middle ground. Maybe they're not ready for the full idea, but they'll accept a smaller version. Perhaps they won't participate, but they'll support your attempt.

### Boundary Setting

Sometimes you need to move forward despite their resistance. ""I hear your concerns, and I'm going to try this anyway. I'd love your support, but I understand if you're not comfortable with it.""

## The Prevention Strategy 🛡️

The best way to handle Idea-Killers is to prevent the dynamic from developing:

### Early Intervention

Address negative patterns as soon as they emerge. Don't let repeated idea-killing become an established role within your group.

### Positive Reinforcement

When chronic critics offer constructive input or show openness to new ideas, acknowledge it immediately. ""That's a great point about implementation. How do you think we could address that?""

### Environmental Design

Create physical and social environments that encourage experimentation. This might mean rearranging meeting rooms, establishing innovation budgets, or celebrating creative attempts regardless of outcomes.

### Cultural Messaging

Regularly communicate that new thinking is valued, even when it doesn't work perfectly. Tell stories about successful innovations that started with seemingly crazy ideas.

## Dealing with Authority Figure Idea-Killers 👔

When your boss or parent consistently shoots down new thinking, the power dynamic complicates your response:

### Preparation Strategy

Come prepared with more thorough research, risk mitigation plans, and small-scale trial proposals. Authority figures often resist because they feel responsible for outcomes.

### Timing Considerations

Approach them when they're less stressed and more receptive. Avoid busy periods or high-pressure situations when their natural risk aversion will be heightened.

### Peer Support

If possible, get colleagues or family members on board first. Authority figures are more likely to consider ideas that have broader support.

### Incremental Approach

Start with tiny changes they can easily approve, then gradually build toward larger innovations as you establish a track record of success.

## The Communication Framework 🗣️

How you present ideas significantly impacts their reception. Use this framework:

### Context Setting

Explain why the current situation needs improvement before proposing solutions. Help them see the problem that your idea solves.

### Benefit Focus

Lead with advantages rather than features. Instead of ""This new software has advanced analytics,"" try ""This could help us make decisions 50% faster.""

### Risk Acknowledgment

Address potential concerns proactively. ""I know you might be worried about the learning curve. Here's how we could minimize disruption during the transition.""

### Trial Proposal

Suggest testing the idea rather than implementing it permanently. ""What if we tried this for one month and evaluated the results?""

## Measuring Progress 📊

Track your success in managing Idea-Killers:

### Frequency Metrics

How often do they immediately reject new suggestions compared to three months ago? Are they asking more questions before dismissing ideas?

### Quality of Objections

Are their concerns becoming more specific and actionable? Vague resistance (""That won't work"") is less helpful than specific concerns (""The budget might not cover training costs"").

### Collaborative Behavior

Do they occasionally build on ideas now rather than just shooting them down? Even small instances of ""What if we also..."" represent significant progress.

### Group Dynamics

Is the overall team more willing to share ideas? Sometimes the biggest indicator of success is increased participation from others who were previously intimidated.

## Advanced Psychology Applications 🎭

For particularly challenging cases, consider these psychological approaches:

### Cognitive Reframing

Help them see their role differently. Instead of ""protector of the status quo,"" they could be ""quality assurance for innovation."" Same analytical skills, different application.

### Social Proof

Introduce them to other analytical people who successfully balance criticism with creativity. Sometimes peer examples are more persuasive than direct instruction.

### Expertise Leveraging

Channel their domain knowledge constructively. ""Given your experience with budget constraints, how would you design a cost-effective version of this idea?""

### Identity Integration

Help them see openness to innovation as compatible with their existing identity. They can still be careful and thorough while being open to new possibilities.

## The Long Game Strategy 🏁

Remember that changing established patterns takes time. Your goal isn't to transform someone overnight, but to gradually shift the dynamic toward more constructive interaction.

**Month 1-2**: Focus on understanding their concerns and building trust through active listening.

**Month 3-4**: Begin introducing small ideas with careful preparation and risk mitigation.

**Month 5-6**: Start involving them in the refinement process, making them partners rather than opponents.

**Month 7-12**: Gradually increase the scope and frequency of new proposals as the relationship evolves.

## Emergency Protocols 🚨

Sometimes you need immediate action despite strong resistance:

### Crisis Decision-Making

In urgent situations, acknowledge their concerns but move forward anyway. ""I understand your reservations. Given our time constraints, I'm going to proceed. We can adjust as we learn more.""

### Damage Control

When you must override their objections, minimize relationship damage by explaining your reasoning and inviting their input on implementation details.

### Recovery Strategies

After moving forward despite resistance, circle back to discuss what happened. What were their concerns? How did things actually unfold? What can you learn for next time?

## Success Stories and Patterns 🎉

Most Idea-Killers can evolve into valuable team members who provide constructive criticism while remaining open to innovation. The transformation happens gradually through consistent application of these strategies.

The key is persistence without aggression. You're not trying to defeat them or prove them wrong. You're trying to create an environment where both creativity and careful analysis can coexist productively.

## Your Action Plan 📋

Starting tomorrow, implement these approaches:

1. **Identify** the Idea-Killers in your life and their specific patterns
2. **Choose** 2-3 strategies that feel most appropriate for each relationship
3. **Practice** new response patterns in low-stakes situations first
4. **Monitor** progress weekly and adjust your approach based on results
5. **Persist** through initial resistance—change takes time

Remember: The goal isn't to eliminate all criticism or create unrealistic optimism. Healthy skepticism prevents genuinely bad decisions. Your objective is to create space for new thinking to develop before it faces evaluation.

The most innovative families, teams, and organizations have learned to channel critical thinking constructively while protecting the fragile early stages of creative ideas. With patience and skill, you can transform your Idea-Killer into your most valuable innovation partner.

The future belongs to groups that can balance creative exploration with thoughtful analysis. By mastering these dynamics, you're not just solving today's problems—you're building the foundation for continuous adaptation and growth.

Every great innovation started as a fragile idea that someone chose to nurture instead of crush. Your role is to create the conditions where those ideas can grow, regardless of who's in the room.

They still had many at Autobooks in Burbank CA last time I was there — this May 2007 one was $1.00 in a pile of about 30 mostly ‘60s and 70s magazines I bought there (the 6-speed swap article caught my eye but it’s a to a car that already once had a 6 speed making the whole thing somewhat useless imo). As usual, check FB marketplace as well. 

I don’t mind promoting Autobooks here and on the Pontiac Reddit because [1.] I’m doing it for Reddit posters as Autobooks may be the only place left in the nation to offer old and new auto/truck/and biker magazines and books; and [2.] they are owned by an old couple but like most mom and pop stores may be hanging on by a thread due to rent and health issues — Jay Leno has come in many Saturday afternoons to spend some green while I was there, I expect mostly to support them.  They sell online but as well but you can also come in person for the old magazines and their Saturday morning Cars and Coffee, Disneyland, Petersen Automotive Museum, Universal Studios, cruise night at Bob’s, the Art Center College’s future-car Transportation design gallery, etc. - they are all nearby, along with Jim Rockford’s Paradise Cove, etc.  

.. and yes there are still some empty back roads, I realized when I had to take a short cut out of there the other day due to a traffic accident and suddenly realized I was on the mountain road where Steven Spielberg shot Duel, for you younger folks his first film about a tractor trailer chasing a ‘71 Valiant. If you’re heading to the Big Sur Coast or the inside of the Central Valley to Yosemite I can also suggest some very nice empty roads in good shape — I exercise the old Bird, the Mustang GT, and even the Saturn/Opel Astra on these roads all the time, usually with tires howling.

## The Universal Challenge We All Face 🤔

We've all met them. The colleague who swears they'll revolutionize the quarterly report, the family member who promises to organize the reunion of the century, or the friend who guarantees they'll help you move but vanishes when the truck arrives. These individuals share a common trait: they excel at painting grand visions but struggle with execution.

This pattern isn't limited by culture, age, or profession. From boardrooms to living rooms, classrooms to community centers, the over-promiser and under-deliverer exists everywhere. Understanding how to work with these individuals effectively isn't just useful—it's essential for maintaining healthy relationships and achieving collective goals.

## Recognizing the Pattern 🎯

Before diving into solutions, let's identify the telltale signs. These individuals typically:

**Display excessive enthusiasm during planning phases** 💫
- Jump into conversations with grand ideas
- Use superlative language (""This will be amazing!"" ""Best project ever!"")
- Volunteer for multiple responsibilities simultaneously
- Show genuine excitement about possibilities

**Demonstrate inconsistent follow-through** ⚡
- Miss deadlines without prior communication
- Provide partial deliverables instead of complete work
- Offer elaborate explanations for delays
- Shift focus to new projects before finishing current ones

**Exhibit specific communication patterns** 💬
- Make commitments in public settings
- Use vague timelines (""soon,"" ""shortly,"" ""next week"")
- Avoid specific accountability measures
- Deflect responsibility when questioned

## The Psychology Behind the Behavior 🧠

Understanding motivation helps us respond more effectively. These individuals often operate from several psychological drivers:

**Optimism bias affects their planning** 🌈
Most over-promisers genuinely believe they can deliver on their commitments. They underestimate complexity, overestimate their available time, and discount potential obstacles. This isn't malicious—it's a cognitive pattern where hope overshadows realistic assessment.

**Social approval drives initial commitment** 👥
Many find satisfaction in the positive response their promises generate. The immediate gratification of being seen as helpful, innovative, or capable can override long-term thinking about actual delivery.

**Overwhelm creates paralysis** 😵
Ironically, the same enthusiasm that creates big promises can lead to feeling overwhelmed when reality sets in. Multiple commitments compound, creating a cycle where avoiding tasks becomes easier than tackling them.

## The Omni-Applicable Strategy Framework 🛠️

This approach works regardless of your relationship to the over-promiser—whether they're your boss, employee, family member, or teammate.

### Phase One: Clear Communication Infrastructure 📋

**Establish concrete expectations upfront**
Instead of accepting vague promises, immediately translate them into specific, measurable outcomes. When someone says, ""I'll handle the presentation,"" respond with: ""Great! So we're talking about a 20-slide deck covering market analysis and budget projections, delivered by Thursday at 3 PM for Friday's meeting, correct?""

**Document agreements in writing** ✍️
Send follow-up messages summarizing what was discussed. ""Hi Sarah, confirming our conversation: you're providing the client contact list by Wednesday morning, including phone numbers and preferred contact times. Thanks!""

**Create milestone checkpoints** 📅
Break larger commitments into smaller, trackable pieces. Instead of waiting until the deadline, schedule progress reviews. ""Let's touch base Tuesday to see how the research is going, then again Thursday to review your draft.""

### Phase Two: Proactive Management 🎪

**Build in buffer time automatically** ⏰
If someone promises delivery by Friday, plan your workflow assuming you'll receive it the following Monday. This protects your timeline while accommodating their pattern.

**Develop parallel approaches** 🔄
For critical deliverables, always have a backup plan. This might mean assigning the same task to multiple people, creating internal alternatives, or maintaining relationships with external resources.

**Implement the ""trust but verify"" principle** 🔍
Regular check-ins aren't micromanagement—they're project management. Frame these as support: ""How can I help ensure you have what you need to meet Tuesday's deadline?""

### Phase Three: Accountability Without Confrontation ⚖️

**Use data instead of emotion** 📊
When discussing missed commitments, focus on observable facts: ""The report was scheduled for Monday and arrived Thursday"" rather than ""You never keep your promises.""

**Focus on impact rather than intent** 🎯
Explain consequences without attacking character: ""When the materials arrive late, it pushes back the entire client timeline"" versus ""You're unreliable.""

**Offer solutions alongside problems** 💡
Instead of just pointing out missed deadlines, suggest process improvements: ""To hit our deadlines consistently, what if we built in a two-day review buffer?""

## Adaptation Strategies by Relationship Type 🎭

### In Professional Settings 💼

**With subordinates:** Use their enthusiasm while providing structure. Assign smaller, more frequent deliverables. Celebrate completed tasks immediately to reinforce positive patterns.

**With colleagues:** Create mutual accountability systems. Pair up for major projects where you both have deliverables to each other.

**With supervisors:** Manage upward by providing regular updates and asking for priority clarification when they add new commitments to your plate.

### In Family Dynamics 🏠

**With partners:** Discuss the pattern openly during calm moments, not during crisis. Focus on how you can work together to improve outcomes.

**With children:** Use this as a teaching opportunity about realistic goal-setting and the importance of keeping one's word.

**With extended family:** Lower expectations while maintaining warmth. Plan important events assuming they may not contribute as promised.

### In Social Groups 👥

**With friends:** Be direct but kind. ""I'd love your help with this, but I need to know I can count on it. Can you honestly commit to being available Saturday morning?""

**In volunteer organizations:** Create systems that don't depend on any single person's promises. Build redundancy into important roles.

## The Long-Term Relationship Strategy 🌱

### Investment vs. Return Analysis 📈

Evaluate each relationship based on overall value rather than just delivery reliability. Someone might be an excellent brainstormer or provide emotional support while being poor at follow-through. Recognize their strengths while protecting yourself from their weaknesses.

### Gradual Pattern Modification 🔄

People can change, but it happens slowly. Instead of expecting dramatic transformation, look for incremental improvements. Celebrate small wins: ""Thanks for updating me about the delay on Tuesday instead of leaving me wondering.""

### Boundary Setting Without Relationship Damage 🚧

You can maintain warm relationships while protecting yourself professionally. ""I really value your creative input on projects, and for deliverables with tight deadlines, I'm going to need to handle those through different channels.""

## Preventing Future Problems 🛡️

### During Initial Commitments 🎯

**Ask qualifying questions immediately:**
- ""What's your availability looking like that week?""
- ""Have you handled something similar before?""
- ""What might prevent you from meeting this deadline?""

**Suggest trial periods for major commitments:**
""Let's start with a smaller project to see how we work together"" creates lower stakes for everyone.

**Build in exit strategies:**
""If circumstances change and you can't deliver, please let me know by Wednesday so we can adjust.""

## When All Else Fails: Damage Control 🆘

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, people don't change. In these situations:

**Maintain professionalism** 🤝
Avoid public criticism or emotional outbursts. Handle issues privately and factually.

**Document patterns for future reference** 📝
Keep records of commitments and outcomes. This helps you make informed decisions about future collaborations.

**Know when to disengage** 🚪
Some relationships require distance if the pattern causes significant stress or harm. This doesn't mean ending the relationship entirely, but perhaps limiting professional collaborations while maintaining social connections.

## The Universal Principles That Transcend Time 🕰️

These strategies work because they're based on fundamental human psychology and clear communication principles that remain constant regardless of technological or social changes:

**Clarity reduces confusion** 💡
Specific expectations will always be more effective than vague hopes, whether we're communicating through handwritten letters or brain interfaces.

**Documentation creates accountability** 📋
Written records provide objective reference points for all parties, regardless of the medium used to create them.

**Regular communication prevents problems** 📞
Frequent check-ins catch issues early, whether conducted face-to-face or through whatever communication technology exists.

**Focusing on behavior rather than character maintains relationships** ❤️
Addressing actions instead of attacking personality will always be more productive for long-term relationship health.

## Turning Challenges into Growth Opportunities 🌟

Working with over-promisers and under-deliverers, while frustrating, can actually strengthen your own skills:

**Project management abilities improve** 📊
You learn to build better timelines, create backup plans, and manage multiple scenarios simultaneously.

**Communication skills sharpen** 🗣️
You practice being direct without being harsh, setting expectations clearly, and providing feedback constructively.

**Emotional intelligence develops** 🧠
You learn to separate someone's intentions from their actions, manage your own frustration, and respond strategically rather than reactively.

**Leadership capabilities expand** 👑
Managing difficult personalities is a core leadership skill that transfers to every area of life.

## Creating Positive Outcomes for Everyone 🎉

The goal isn't to punish or change over-promisers, but to create systems where everyone can succeed. When you:

- Provide clear structure, you help them channel their enthusiasm effectively
- Build in accountability measures, you create opportunities for them to build better habits
- Focus on strengths while managing weaknesses, you maintain positive relationships
- Document agreements, you protect everyone from misunderstandings

## Your Action Plan Starting Today 🚀

**Immediate steps (this week):**
1. Identify one over-promiser in your life causing regular stress
2. Document their pattern of commitments vs. deliveries objectively
3. Plan your next interaction using the clear communication strategies outlined above

**Short-term implementation (this month):**
1. Practice the milestone and checkpoint system with all major commitments
2. Start building buffer time into your planning automatically
3. Develop backup plans for critical deliverables

**Long-term relationship management (ongoing):**
1. Regularly evaluate relationships using the investment vs. return framework
2. Celebrate incremental improvements when you see them
3. Maintain boundaries while preserving warmth in relationships

Remember, dealing with over-promisers and under-deliverers is a skill that improves with practice. The more consistently you apply these strategies, the more natural they become, and the less stress these individuals will cause in your life.

The key is approaching these relationships with realistic expectations, clear communication, and systematic follow-through. By doing so, you protect your own interests while maintaining the possibility for positive outcomes with people who, despite their delivery challenges, may bring other valuable qualities to your life and work.

1n4g497,https://youtu.be/wlleFqHwBiM,3 Very Scary TRUE Lost Media Horror Stories,"# ""Finding Mom"":

I was in my late twenties when I first heard about the unaired episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" that featured my mother's case. My name is Autumn, and back in 2001, I was just a college student living at home with my parents in Dallas. My mother, Sharon, was a kind teacher who always put us first. My father, Ron, was different—he liked control, and their marriage had turned sour. She filed for divorce two days before she went missing. That day, June 13, she dropped me off at the bus depot for my summer class. ""Be safe, honey,"" she said with a quick hug. ""I'll see you tonight."" But she never came home.

For years, I pushed the pain down, focused on my job as a librarian, helping people find lost books and records. But last year, a podcast episode about unsolved cases mentioned the lost segment. The producers had interviewed my brother Ronnie and me back then, right after it happened. They filmed us in our living room, asking about Mom's last days. I remembered the camera crew setting up, the bright lights making everything feel exposed. ""Tell us about your father's reaction,"" the interviewer asked me softly. I hesitated, glancing at Ronnie. ""He seemed calm,"" I said. ""Too calm."" The segment was set to air in 2002, but my father sent a letter, and it got pulled. No one has seen it since.

Curiosity gnawed at me. What if that tape held something—a detail we missed, a clue that could prove what happened to Mom? I started simple, emailing the show's old production company. No reply. Then I searched online forums, where true crime fans discussed it as ""lost media."" One user posted, ""It's out there somewhere, but good luck finding it without stirring up trouble."" That comment stuck with me. I decided to dig deeper.

First, I called my brother Ronnie. He lived in Austin now, working as an engineer. ""Autumn, why bring this up?"" he asked over the phone, his voice tired. ""It's been over twenty years."" I told him about the podcast. ""What if the segment shows something about Dad? Like, his story doesn't add up."" Ronnie paused. ""Remember when I confronted him that September? He pulled a gun on me. The grand jury didn't indict, but I know he's capable."" We talked for an hour, recalling how Dad claimed Mom ran off with money, calling her unstable. None of it matched the woman we knew. ""If you find that tape,"" Ronnie said, ""be careful. Dad still asks about you.""

Next, I reached out to Cheryl Wattley, the lawyer Dad hired right after Mom vanished. She had testified against him in a lawsuit he filed for his retainer back. I found her number through an old news article. ""Ms. Wattley,"" I said when she picked up, ""I'm Sharon Davis's daughter. I'm looking for information on the 'Unsolved Mysteries' segment."" She was quiet at first. ""I remember your family,"" she replied. ""Your father wanted me to paint your mother as mentally ill or involved in drugs. I refused. That's why he sued me."" I asked if she knew about the tape. ""The producers contacted me for an interview, but after Ron's letter, it all stopped. He was worried about investigations into his finances—tax issues, maybe more."" Her words made my skin crawl. ""More like what?"" I pressed. ""Money laundering suspicions,"" she whispered. ""He feared the show would expose it."" We ended the call, but her tone lingered—like she knew something dangerous.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I sat at my computer, scouring archives for any clip or script from the segment. I joined a lost media group online, posting anonymously: ""Seeking unaired UM episode on Sharon Davis disappearance."" Responses came in. One user messaged privately: ""I heard a producer leaked parts to a collector. Check this address in LA."" It seemed sketchy, but I booked a flight. Before leaving, I visited the old house. Dad still lived there, alone. I hadn't spoken to him in years, but I needed to see his reaction.

I knocked on the door. He opened it, looking older, his eyes sharp. ""Autumn,"" he said, not smiling. ""What brings you here?"" I stepped inside, the place unchanged—Mom's photos gone. ""I'm researching Mom's case,"" I told him. ""About that TV segment."" His face hardened. ""That was a mistake. They twisted everything."" We sat in the kitchen. ""Why did you stop it from airing?"" I asked. He leaned forward. ""Because it was lies. Your mother left us. She took cash and ran."" I shook my head. ""The van was wiped clean, Dad. No prints."" He stood up abruptly. ""You sound like your brother. Accusing me."" His voice rose. ""If you keep digging, you'll regret it."" I left quickly, his words echoing.

In LA, I met the contact—a man named Paul, a retired archivist who collected old TV tapes. We met in a dim storage unit filled with boxes. ""I have a partial script,"" he said, handing me papers. ""No video, but notes from the shoot."" I read it eagerly. It described interviews with neighbors who heard arguments, Dad's alibi of an early breakfast meeting that no one confirmed. One line chilled me: ""Ron Davis expressed concern over financial scrutiny."" Paul watched me. ""This stuff can be dangerous,"" he warned. ""People hide media for a reason."" As I left, I felt eyes on me.

Back home, strange things started. My phone rang at odd hours, no one speaking. Once, a voice whispered, ""Stop looking."" I told Ronnie. ""It's Dad,"" he said. ""He's trying to scare you."" I pushed on, contacting a former ""Unsolved Mysteries"" producer via LinkedIn. ""The segment is archived,"" she emailed. ""But sealed due to legal threats. I can send a transcript if you sign a waiver."" It arrived days later. Reading it alone in my apartment, I saw details I never knew—witnesses saying Dad moved the van the night before Mom vanished. My hands shook.

Then, the knocking started. Late one evening, someone pounded on my door. I peeked through the peephole—no one. I opened it slightly, finding a note: ""The tape stays lost. Or you join your mother."" Panic rose. I called the police, but without proof, they couldn't help. I drove to Dad's house that night, furious. He answered, calm. ""What now?"" he asked. ""Did you send that note?"" I demanded. He smirked. ""You're imagining things, like your mother."" I stepped closer. ""The transcript mentions your finances. What did you do?"" His eyes darkened. ""Get out,"" he growled. As I turned, he grabbed my arm. ""If that segment ever surfaces, it'll destroy everything. Including you.""

I pulled away and ran to my car. Driving home, headlights followed me too closely. I sped up, turning corners, but they stayed. Finally, I lost them at a light. Shaken, I hid the transcript. Days later, Ronnie came to stay. ""We need to go public,"" he said. We contacted a journalist, sharing what we had. But the fear never left. Every shadow, every call made me jump. What if Dad had help? What if the full tape showed the truth—a plan, a cover-up?

Months passed. The case got attention again, but the segment remains lost. I still search, but now I lock my doors tight. Sometimes, I hear footsteps outside. And I wonder if finding that media would free me—or end me.





# ""The Card on Fairbanks"":

I work as a clerk at a small store in Anchorage, and my shifts often end late. One night, after locking up, I decided to walk the few blocks to my apartment instead of waiting for the bus. The street was quiet, with only a few cars passing by. As I crossed near Fairbanks Street, something caught my eye on the ground—a tiny black rectangle, half-hidden under a leaf. I bent down and picked it up. It was an SD card, the kind used in cameras. I figured someone had dropped it from a phone or something, maybe vacation photos. I slipped it into my pocket and kept walking.

When I got home, I made a cup of tea and sat at my kitchen table. My laptop was open, so I popped the card into the slot out of curiosity. The folder popped up with a label: ""Homicide at midtown Marriott."" My first thought was that it was a joke, like a movie file or a prank. I clicked it open anyway. Inside were dozens of files—photos and videos, numbered in order.

I started with the first photo. It showed a hotel room, messy with clothes on the floor and a bed in the background. Nothing odd yet. The next few were similar, but then one showed a woman lying on the carpet. She looked hurt, with bruises on her arms. I leaned closer, feeling uneasy. Who would take pictures like this? I opened a video file next. It was shaky at first, then steadied on the same woman. She was Alaska Native, like many folks around here, with long dark hair. She seemed asleep or unconscious on the bed.

A man's voice came through the speakers, deep with a strange accent—not American, maybe from somewhere else. ""Wake up,"" he said. The woman stirred, mumbling something I couldn't make out. He laughed, a low chuckle that made my skin prickle. ""You're not going anywhere,"" he told her. The camera moved closer, showing him poking her with his foot. She groaned and tried to sit up, but he pushed her back down. ""Stay still,"" he ordered.

I paused the video, my hands trembling a little. This didn't feel like acting. The woman's eyes looked real—scared, confused. I called my friend Lisa, who lives a few doors down. She's a nurse and always level-headed. ""Hey, Lisa, you busy? I found this SD card on the street, and there's weird stuff on it.""

""What's weird about it?"" she asked, her voice casual over the phone.

""Like, videos of a guy harassing a woman in a hotel. It says 'homicide' on the folder. Might be fake, but it's creeping me out.""

She laughed at first. ""Probably some dumb horror short. People make those all the time. Play it and tell me.""

I hit play again while she listened on speaker. The man in the video kept talking, describing what he planned to do. ""I'm going to make this fun,"" he said. The woman begged him to stop, her voice weak. ""Please, let me go. I won't tell anyone."" He ignored her, stepping harder on her leg. She cried out.

Lisa went quiet. ""That sounds too real. Turn it off. Maybe it's from a movie set or something.""

""But look at the details,"" I said, switching to another photo. It showed close-ups of her face, twisted in pain. ""No way this is staged. The bruises look fresh.""

""Scroll through more,"" Lisa suggested. ""See if there's a credits or anything.""

I opened the next video. This one was longer. The man had her on the floor now. He stood over her, his foot on her neck. ""Breathe,"" he mocked, pressing down. She gasped, her hands clawing at his shoe. ""Stop... please..."" she whispered. He lifted his foot, then stomped hard. The sound was awful—a crunch that echoed. She went still for a moment, then coughed, struggling.

My breath caught. I felt sick. ""Lisa, this is bad. He's hurting her for real.""

""Don't watch anymore,"" she said, her tone serious now. ""Take it to the police. Right now.""

I nodded, even though she couldn't see. But I couldn't stop yet. I needed to know how it ended. The next files were worse. Photos of her body, limp and marked up. One video showed him wrapping her in a sheet, dragging her across the room. ""Time to clean up,"" he muttered to himself. His voice was calm, like he was talking about laundry. At the end, he looked right at the camera and smiled. ""Everyone dies eventually.""

I yanked the card out of my laptop. My apartment felt too small, the walls closing in. I grabbed my coat and headed out, calling the police non-emergency line on the way. ""I found an SD card with videos of a possible murder,"" I told the dispatcher. She asked for details, and I described the accent, the hotel, the woman's pleas.

""Stay where you are,"" she said. ""An officer will meet you.""

I waited at a nearby coffee shop, the card burning a hole in my pocket. Officer Ramirez arrived, a tall man with a stern face. ""You the one who called?"" he asked.

""Yes. Here it is."" I handed it over. ""The folder says 'homicide.' There's a man with a foreign accent killing a woman.""

He took it carefully, gloving up. ""We'll look into it. Can you describe what you saw?""

I recounted the videos, the stomping, the woman's last words. ""She begged him. He just laughed.""

Ramirez nodded. ""Sounds serious. We'll need your statement at the station.""

At the station, they had me sit in a room while techs reviewed the card. A detective named Harlan joined us. ""The videos match a missing person case,"" he said. ""The woman is Kathleen Jo Henry. Reported missing a few weeks ago.""

My mouth went dry. ""So it's real?""

""Very real,"" Harlan replied. ""The man in the footage—we think we know him. Brian Steven Smith. South African guy, works as a trucker here. His accent gave him away. We've got eyes on him now.""

I shivered. ""What if he knows someone found the card? What if he comes looking?""

Harlan shook his head. ""Unlikely. But we'll keep you safe. Just stay alert.""

That night, back home, I couldn't sleep. Every creak in the building made me jump. I kept hearing that man's voice in my head, his casual cruelty. ""Everyone dies."" What kind of person records that? And labels it like a trophy?

The next day, Lisa came over. ""You okay?"" she asked, hugging me.

""Not really. They arrested him. Smith. He confessed to another killing too—Veronica Abouchuk. Shot her in the head.""

Lisa's eyes widened. ""How did he get away with it for so long?""

""He preyed on vulnerable people,"" I said, repeating what the detective told me. ""Alaska Natives, homeless folks. No one noticed at first.""

We sat in silence for a bit. Then Lisa said, ""What if there are more cards out there? More videos?""

The thought hit me hard. Smith had taken photos of another woman, possibly a third victim. The police released sketches later, hoping to identify her. But what if he had hidden more evidence? What if someone else found one and didn't report it?

Weeks passed, and the trial started. I had to testify about finding the card. In court, they played snippets of the audio—no video, thank goodness. Hearing Kathleen's voice again, her desperate pleas, made my eyes fill up. ""Please, don't,"" she said in one clip. Smith sat there, expressionless, like it meant nothing.

The judge sentenced him to 226 years. No parole. Justice, they called it. But I still dream about those files. The way he documented every step, turning horror into media. It's like he wanted it found, wanted someone to see his work.

Now, I check the ground less, avoid dark streets. But sometimes, I wonder if there are other lost pieces out there—cards, tapes, waiting to be picked up. And what stories they hold. The real ones are always the scariest.





# ""Final Broadcast"":

I got my first break in broadcasting right out of college, landing a spot as a production assistant at a small TV station in Florida. It was 1973, and the place was called WXLT-TV, channel 40 out of Sarasota. The newsroom was tiny, just a handful of us scrambling to put together local stories for the morning show. Christine was already there when I started—she handled the community affairs segment, always pushing for deeper reports on local issues. She had this intense focus, like she carried the weight of every story personally. I remember her dark hair, sharp features, and how she rarely smiled unless she was on camera.  
  
At first, things seemed normal. I helped with scripts, ran errands, and sometimes sat in on meetings. Christine and I crossed paths often because my desk was near hers. She would ask me to fetch research materials or double-check facts. ""Make sure this is accurate, Tom,"" she'd say, her voice steady but urgent. Tom—that's me. I nodded and did what she asked, eager to learn. But over the months, I noticed little changes in her. She started arriving later, looking more tired. Once, I overheard her arguing with the news director about the station's policy on sensational stories. ""We need more blood and guts to get ratings,"" the director said, half-joking. Christine's face tightened. ""That's not journalism,"" she replied sharply. ""That's exploitation.""  
  
By early 1974, the tension grew. Christine pitched a series on suicide prevention, which got approved, but she seemed obsessed with it. She spent hours in the archives, pulling old clips of accidents and crimes. I helped her one afternoon, sorting through reels of film. ""Why this topic?"" I asked, trying to make conversation. She paused, staring at a blank tape label. ""Because people need to understand the pain,"" she said quietly. ""It's real, Tom. More real than anything we broadcast."" Her words stuck with me, but I brushed it off as dedication.  
  
As summer approached, Christine's behavior shifted again. She requested to anchor the news one day, which was unusual—she wasn't the regular host. The director agreed, thinking it might boost morale. On July 15, I was in the control room, monitoring the feed. The show was ""Suncoast Digest,"" starting at 9:30 a.m. Christine sat at the desk, papers in hand, looking composed. The camera rolled, and she began with the usual headlines: a local shooting, a plane crash, some policy updates. Her voice was clear, professional.  
  
Then, something felt off. She fumbled a transition, and the teleprompter glitched briefly. I leaned forward in my chair, watching the monitor. Christine glanced at the camera, her expression blank. ""In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in blood and guts, and in living color,"" she said, her tone flat, ""you are going to see another first—attempted suicide."" My mind raced. What did she mean? Before I could react, she reached under the desk, pulled out a revolver, and pressed it behind her right ear. The bang echoed through the speakers. She slumped forward, blood spreading across the papers.  
  
The control room erupted. The director yelled, ""Cut to black! Cut now!"" I froze, staring at the screen as the image faded. Someone grabbed the phone to call emergency services. I stumbled out, my hands shaking. In the studio, chaos reigned—people rushing to her side, but it was too late. Christine was gone. Police arrived quickly, securing the area. I gave a statement, numb, repeating what I saw. That night, I couldn't sleep, replaying her words in my head.  
  
The tape became the center of everything after that. The station had recorded the broadcast, as always. The director locked it in his office safe, saying it was evidence. Police reviewed it, then returned it with strict orders: no copies, no airings. But rumors spread fast. Reporters from bigger networks called, asking if we'd seen ""the tape."" I hadn't, not the full thing—only the live moment. One evening, a week later, the director pulled me aside. ""Tom, help me with something,"" he whispered. We went to his office after hours. He opened the safe and took out the reel. ""We need to dub a copy for the lawyers,"" he explained, but his eyes darted nervously.  
  
We set up the equipment in a back room. As the tape played, I watched in silence. It started normal: Christine's intro, the stories. Then her statement, the gun, the shot. But seeing it again, slowed down, revealed details I missed live. Her hand trembled slightly as she spoke. The blood pooled in a pattern that looked almost deliberate. After the slump, the camera held for seconds before cutting—enough to hear faint gasps from the crew off-screen. The director paused it. ""This can't get out,"" he said. ""It would destroy us."" I nodded, but a chill settled in me. What if someone wanted it out?  
  
Days turned to weeks, and the tape vanished from conversation. The station owner, Bob, took possession, saying he'd handle it. But strange things started happening. Anonymous calls came in at night, asking for ""Christine's final broadcast."" I answered one: a low voice said, ""I know you have it. Send it to me."" I hung up, heart racing. Then, letters arrived—envelopes with no return address, demanding the footage. One included a photo of the studio desk, stained red, taken from an angle only insiders would know.  
  
I confided in a coworker, Jean, the evening anchor. ""This is getting weird,"" I told her over coffee in the break room. ""Who would want that tape?"" Jean frowned. ""People are sick, Tom. True crime fans, maybe. Or worse—someone who knew her."" She mentioned Christine had struggled with depression, had seen doctors, but kept it private. ""She planned this,"" Jean added. ""That gun—she bought it days before.""  
  
One night, I stayed late to finish edits. The building was empty, lights dim. I heard footsteps in the hall, slow and deliberate. I peeked out—nothing. Back at my desk, I found a note: ""The tape reveals more. Watch closely."" My pulse quickened. Who left it? I checked the safe—it was locked, but I wondered if copies existed. The director had mentioned dubbing; maybe he made extras.  
  
Curiosity gnawed at me. I asked Bob about the tape during a staff meeting. ""It's secure,"" he snapped. ""Drop it."" But his wife, Mollie, overheard later. She pulled me aside in the parking lot. ""Bob keeps it at home now,"" she whispered. ""He watches it sometimes. Says it's to remember what happened."" Her eyes widened. ""But last night, he muttered something about hearing whispers in the audio.""  
  
I decided to see for myself. Late one evening, I convinced the director to let me review old footage for a memorial segment— a lie, but he bought it. We played the tape again. This time, I listened carefully. After the shot, amid the chaos, a faint sound emerged—like a sigh, or a word. I rewound. ""Help,"" it seemed to say, but distorted. Was it Christine's last breath? Or imagination? The director paled. ""Turn it off,"" he ordered.  
  
The harassment escalated. My car was broken into, nothing taken but papers rifled through. Jean got a call: ""Give us the tape, or we'll make our own."" We reported it to police, but they dismissed it as pranks. Then, Bob announced the tape would go to the family—Christine's brother, I think. ""It's over,"" he said. But it wasn't. Years later, after I left the station, I heard whispers in industry circles: bootlegs circulating underground, shown at private viewings. One contact claimed he saw a copy—grainy, but with extra frames showing Christine's eyes flickering post-shot.  
  
I tried to move on, took a job in another city. But last year, an email arrived from an unknown sender: a link to a dark web site. ""Christine's legacy,"" the subject read. I clicked, foolishly. A video loaded—her broadcast, but edited with close-ups, slowed motion on the gun. Comments below: ""Real death, better than fiction."" ""I have the original—DM for trade."" I closed it, deleted the email, but sleep evaded me. What if the tape wasn't just a recording? What if it captured something irreversible, a moment that draws the wrong people?  
  
Now, I avoid old colleagues. Jean called recently: ""Tom, Bob passed away. Mollie has the tape now. She says she'll never release it."" But I wonder—how long until it leaks? Every time I see a news anchor falter on TV, I flinch. Christine's act wasn't just suicide; it was a statement that lingers, pulling in those who seek the dark. And the tape? It's out there, hidden, waiting to surface and remind us how thin the line is between reporting the horror and becoming it.",1,1756597605.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1n4g41a,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n4g41a/the_art_of_supporting_your_teams_pessimist_a/,The Art of Supporting Your Team's Pessimist: A Practical Guide,"
Every group has one – that person who sees the glass as half empty, points out potential problems, and seems to dampen enthusiasm with their cautious outlook. Whether it's your colleague who questions every new initiative, your family member who worries about everything, or that team member who always asks ""but what if it fails?"" – dealing with pessimistic personalities can feel challenging.

But here's the thing: pessimists aren't trying to be difficult. They're often the unsung heroes who catch problems before they become disasters, ask the tough questions others avoid, and provide the reality checks that save time, money, and heartache down the road. 🎯

## Understanding the Pessimistic Mind

Pessimists operate from a place of caution and preparation. Their brains are wired to spot potential risks and problems – it's like having a built-in early warning system. While optimists see possibilities, pessimists see pitfalls. Neither perspective is inherently right or wrong; they're just different ways of processing the world.

Think about it this way: if you were crossing a bridge, you'd want both the engineer who designed it with confidence AND the inspector who checked every bolt for weakness. That inspector? They're thinking like a pessimist, and that's exactly what keeps the bridge safe. 🌉

## The Hidden Value They Bring

Before diving into strategies, let's acknowledge what pessimists contribute:

**Risk Assessment** – They're natural problem-spotters who can identify potential issues before they blow up into major crises. This saves everyone time, energy, and resources.

**Quality Control** – Their critical eye often catches details others miss, leading to better outcomes and fewer mistakes.

**Preparation** – They think through scenarios and backup plans, making teams more resilient when things don't go as expected.

**Honest Feedback** – While it might sting, their unfiltered observations can provide valuable insights that polite optimists might sugarcoat.

## Daily Interaction Strategies That Actually Work

### 1. Acknowledge Their Concerns First 🎤

When a pessimist raises an objection or worry, resist the urge to immediately counter with positivity. Instead, start with acknowledgment:

""I can see you're concerned about the timeline on this project. Help me understand what specific challenges you're anticipating.""

This approach validates their perspective before moving toward solutions. When people feel heard, they're more likely to engage constructively rather than dig in their heels.

### 2. Channel Their Energy Into Problem-Solving

Instead of fighting their tendency to focus on problems, redirect it toward solutions:

""You've identified some real challenges here. Given your experience, what would you suggest we do to address them?""

This transforms them from a roadblock into a strategic advisor. You're essentially saying, ""Your concerns are valid – now help us fix them.""

### 3. Give Them Preparation Time ⏰

Pessimists hate being blindsided. They need time to process information, consider implications, and mentally prepare for changes. When possible:

- Share information early, even if details aren't finalized
- Allow time for questions and discussion
- Provide context for decisions rather than just announcing outcomes

A pessimist who feels prepared is much more likely to be supportive than one who feels ambushed.

### 4. Create Safe Spaces for Concerns

Establish regular opportunities for them to voice worries without judgment. This could be:

- Weekly one-on-one check-ins
- Anonymous feedback systems
- Designated ""devil's advocate"" roles in meetings

When pessimists have legitimate channels to express concerns, they're less likely to become chronic complainers or silent saboteurs.

## Communication Techniques That Build Bridges

### Use Data and Logic 📊

Pessimists respond better to facts than feelings. Instead of saying ""Everything will work out fine,"" try ""Based on our last three similar projects, we completed them an average of 2 days early, so this timeline should be manageable.""

### Break Down Big Changes

Large initiatives can overwhelm pessimistic thinkers. Break them into smaller, manageable pieces with clear milestones. This makes the overall goal feel less daunting and provides multiple opportunities for course correction.

### Address Specific Concerns

Vague reassurances don't work. If they're worried about budget overruns, show them the detailed financial projections. If they're concerned about timeline, walk through the project schedule step by step.

## Building Long-Term Relationships

### Respect Their Process

Some people make decisions quickly based on gut feelings. Pessimists typically need more time to analyze, question, and mentally walk through scenarios. Rushing them often backfires, leading to increased resistance or anxiety.

### Celebrate Their Wins 🏆

When their cautious approach prevents a problem or their questions lead to improvements, acknowledge it publicly. This reinforces the value they bring and encourages continued participation.

### Don't Try to ""Fix"" Their Personality

Attempting to turn a pessimist into an optimist is like trying to change someone's eye color – frustrating and ultimately futile. Instead, focus on helping them express their natural tendencies in productive ways.

## Practical Applications Across Different Settings

### At Home

Family pessimists often worry about finances, safety, or future security. Include them in planning and preparation activities where their cautious nature is an asset. When making family decisions, ask for their input on potential challenges and how to address them.

### In the Workplace

Assign them to roles where attention to risk and detail is valuable – project planning, quality assurance, financial review, or safety oversight. Their natural skepticism becomes a professional strength rather than a personality quirk.

### In Social Groups

Let them be the ones who research restaurants before group outings, check weather forecasts for outdoor events, or review contracts for group purchases. Their thorough approach benefits everyone.

## When Pessimism Becomes Problematic

Sometimes pessimistic thinking crosses the line from helpful caution to paralyzing negativity. Watch for signs like:

- Refusing to consider any positive outcomes
- Consistently shutting down all new ideas without discussion
- Creating anxiety in others through constant worry-sharing
- Using past failures to justify not trying anything new

In these cases, gentle but direct conversation may be needed. Focus on the impact of their behavior rather than their personality: ""I've noticed that when we brainstorm new ideas, the discussion often gets stuck on potential problems. How can we balance risk awareness with forward progress?""

## The Power of Complementary Thinking

The most successful teams, families, and organizations have a mix of optimists and pessimists. They need each other. Optimists provide the energy and vision to pursue goals, while pessimists provide the caution and analysis to pursue them wisely.

Your job isn't to change the pessimist in your life – it's to create an environment where their natural tendencies contribute positively to shared goals. When you stop seeing their caution as opposition and start seeing it as a different form of caring, everything changes. 💡

## Moving Forward Together

Remember that behind every pessimistic comment is usually someone who cares about the outcome. They're not trying to rain on parades – they're trying to make sure the parade doesn't get rained on. That's actually pretty thoughtful when you think about it.

The next time your pessimistic colleague, family member, or friend raises a concern, try responding with curiosity instead of defensiveness. Ask follow-up questions. Explore their reasoning. You might discover valuable insights hidden beneath their cautious exterior.

Building bridges with pessimists isn't about changing them – it's about understanding them, valuing their contributions, and creating space for their perspective in your shared journey forward. When you do this successfully, you don't just improve your relationship with them; you make your entire team, family, or organization stronger and more resilient.

After all, the best outcomes usually come from combining bold vision with careful planning, optimistic energy with realistic preparation, and hopeful dreams with practical wisdom. The pessimists in your life aren't obstacles to success – they might just be essential partners in achieving it. 🤝

TL;DR

I treated quitting gambling like a training camp. I built a 12-week plan with clear rules, daily routines, self-exclusion, blockers, and “urge drills.” Results: urges dropped, sleep improved, and I stopped chasing losses. Below is the exact plan I followed so you can copy it.

⸻

Why I’m posting

I searched “how to quit gambling,” “stop sports betting urges,” and “rewire your brain from addiction,” and most advice was vague. This is the concrete, athlete-style routine that finally worked for me.

⸻

My baseline (so you can compare)
   •   Losses: constant “win some, lose more” loop


   •   Triggers: boredom at night, watching live sports, payday spikes, being alone in the car


   •   Physical tells: racing heart, shallow breathing, twitchy scrolling


   •   Goal: 90 days no gambling (sports betting, casinos, pokies, online games—everything)



⸻

The 12-Week “Athlete” Plan

1) Season rules (no grey areas)
   •   Zero bets. Zero “just checking odds.” Zero “small flutter.”


   •   No cash accounts on gambling sites. Close/withdraw.


   •   Self-exclude everywhere you’ve used (online & in-person).


   •   Write these rules at the top of a notebook: “I don’t gamble. I train.”



2) Remove friction to fail (10-minute setup)


   •   Install device/site blockers and DNS filters.


   •   Ask your bank for gambling transaction blocks and/or lower daily limits.


   •   Delete gambling apps, clear saved cards, log out of email auto-fills.


   •   Tell one trusted person. Accountability flips the script.



3) Daily routine (athlete mode)


   •   Morning (45–60 min): movement (run, weights, or long walk), water, protein.


   •   Midday (5–10 min): breathing drill (4-7-8), quick sunlight, 10 pushups.


   •   Evening (60–90 min): phone out of room, stretch/foam roll, read or journal.


   •   Sleep: fixed time, dark room, no screens last hour. Urges hate structure.



4) Urge Drills (the “craving protocol”)



When a wave hits, run this playbook—do it immediately:


	1.	Name it: “This is an urge. It peaks then fades.”


	2.	Breathe: 10 slow breaths (inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6).


	3.	Delay: set a 15-minute timer. No decisions until it ends.


	4.	Move: 5–10 minutes brisk walk or 30 air squats.


	5.	Replace: call/text your accountability person or do a 2-minute cold rinse.


	6.	Record: jot the trigger + time in your notebook. Patterns beat willpower.



5) Replace the dopamine (without chaos)


   •   Training goal: 5 workouts/week (track sets/reps/time).


   •   Learning goal: 30 minutes/day of skill building (finance basics, coding, language).


   •   Social goal: one call/meet per day (short counts).


   •   Money goal: daily micro-transfer to a “No-Gamble Fund.” Watch it grow.



6) Content diet (massive)
   •   Mute sports betting ads, tipster accounts, casino content.


   •   If live sports trigger you, watch highlights only for the first 4–6 weeks.


   •   Replace doom scroll with 2–3 long-form creators that build skills.



7) Money systems that kill relapse


   •   Two-card method: one everyday card, one “vault” card stored away.


   •   Delay big purchases: 24-hour rule.
   •   Weekly cash envelope for discretionary spend—when it’s gone, it’s gone.
   •   Emergency friction: keep $0 in any account linked to gambling sites.

8) Weekly review (10 minutes, Sundays)
   •   Score yourself 0–10 on Sleep, Training, Urges, Triggers, Money.
   •   Write one tiny upgrade for next week. Athletes adjust, they don’t “hope.”

⸻

My 90-Day Results (real talk)
   •   Urges: from daily to maybe twice a week, intensity way lower
   •   Sleep: deeper, fewer “what-if” loops
   •   Money: savings finally moved up and stayed up
   •   Mindset: confidence returned because I kept promises to myself

⸻

FAQs 

How long does it take to break a gambling habit?
Cravings ease in 2–4 weeks with blockers + routine. Real mental clarity showed up for me around day 45–60. I committed to 90 days for a full reset.

Can you quit gambling without therapy?
Yes, some do with self-exclusion, blockers, accountability, and routines. If you’ve got debt, depression, or compulsive cycles, therapy/helplines add horsepower. Use every tool.

What should I do after a relapse?
Don’t spiral. Post-mortem the trigger, add one new friction (stronger block, tighter cash rules), text your accountability person, and restart the 90-day clock. Athletes review film and get back on the field.

How do I stop gambling urges at night?
Night routine is king: phone out of bedroom, pre-planned wind-down, hot shower or stretch, lights low, book > screen, set coffee gear for morning (tiny win). If a wave hits, run the Urge Drill.

What if sports betting is my only “hobby”?
Replace with training + learning. Give yourself two weeks to feel the shift. Boredom is withdrawal. Purpose arrives when you track progress.

⸻

Copy-My Checklist
   •   Self-exclude everywhere I’ve gambled
   •   Install device/site blockers
   •   Tell one trusted person today
   •   Build a 3-part daily routine (move / breathe / read)
   •   Set a nightly phone-free hour
   •   Create a “No-Gamble Fund” and automate $5–$20/day
   •   Schedule a 10-minute Sunday review

⸻

If you want my templates

I’ve got a one-page urge tracker, a weekly review sheet, and a 12-week scoreboard I used. Comment “send the tracker” and I’ll drop it below.

⸻

Final note

You are not broken—you’re deconditioned to easy dopamine. Train like an athlete for 12 weeks and your brain will follow your body. I don’t gamble. I train.

⸻

(Not medical advice. If you’re in crisis or dealing with heavy debt or mental health issues, reach out to local helplines or a professional. Pairing support with this routine speeds everything up.)",1,1756597537.0,u_free_from_desire,0,1.0,False

I recently thrifted this coffee and end table set with really cool world maps set into the top. They're in pretty rough shape, and I'm looking to get them at least looking good from one meter, if not better.  
1. The veneer is pretty badly chipped on pretty much all surfaces, down into the actual wood in places. I'm not quite sure about how to go about leveling the dings as well as color matching. Anyone got putty/stain recommendations?  
2. The maps on top look to be coated with some kind of spray-on coating based on the orange peel texture. This is worn through in places and scuffed in others. I'm tentatively planning to fill the map recess with clear resin to protect the maps from further harm, but I'd like to get them looking at least a little better before locking that in, and not sure where to start, or even what the current protective layer is.

If anyone has worked with this kind of table before, I'd love to hear your story and advice, plus any general advice on patching veneer and resin fill!  
Thanks and I'll post updates once I've made some progress.

Followed a couple hours later with a protein shake (fairlife or powder) then one main meal of between 800-1000 calories, high protein, low carb. Example would be 5oz ribeye, 2 eggs, half sweet potato and maybe yogurt/cottage cheese to fill in any macro gaps

Fasting days would be strict, with electrolytes and black coffee, tea, water.

*Transform frustration into action with these time-tested strategies*

---

## The Universal Challenge We All Face ⏰

Whether it's your colleague who strolls into meetings 15 minutes late, your family member who makes everyone wait for dinner, or that friend who's never on time for anything – we've all encountered the chronically late person. This behavior pattern affects millions of relationships worldwide and costs businesses billions in lost productivity annually.

The good news? This challenge isn't unsolvable. With the right approach, you can minimize the impact of tardiness while maintaining healthy relationships.

## Understanding the Late Person's Mind 🧠

Before diving into solutions, let's examine why some people consistently run behind schedule:

**Time Optimism Bias**: Many chronically late individuals genuinely believe they can accomplish more in less time than reality allows. They underestimate travel time, task duration, and unexpected delays.

**Attention and Focus Patterns**: Some people hyperfocus on current activities, losing track of time completely. They might start ""one quick task"" that extends far beyond their expectations.

**Thrill-Seeking Behavior**: Certain individuals unconsciously enjoy the adrenaline rush of cutting things close, even when it inconveniences others.

**Poor Planning Skills**: Some folks simply lack effective time management systems and wing it through life without structured approaches.

**Perfectionist Tendencies**: Others delay departure until everything is ""perfect"" – the right outfit, the perfect email response, or one more task completion.

## The Real Cost of Chronic Lateness 💰

Late arrivals create ripple effects that extend far beyond the initial delay:

- **Relationship Strain**: Trust erodes when others consistently can't rely on someone's punctuality
- **Productivity Loss**: Team meetings restart, presentations get delayed, and momentum dies
- **Stress Multiplication**: Everyone's anxiety increases when schedules become unpredictable
- **Opportunity Costs**: Missing crucial moments, important discussions, or time-sensitive decisions
- **Reputation Damage**: Professional and personal credibility suffers over time

## The Complete Strategy Toolkit 🛠️

### Strategy 1: The Buffer Zone Method

**What it is**: Build automatic delays into your schedule when dealing with chronically late individuals.

**How to implement**: 
- Tell them meetings start 15-30 minutes earlier than actual time
- Schedule their involvement for later in group activities
- Create personal arrival buffers for events they're attending

**Real-world application**: If your team meeting starts at 2 PM, tell the late member it begins at 1:45 PM. When they arrive ""5 minutes late"" at 1:50 PM, they're actually 10 minutes early.

### Strategy 2: The Natural Consequences Approach

**What it is**: Allow the late person to experience the full impact of their tardiness without rescuing them.

**How to implement**:
- Start meetings on time regardless of who's missing
- Don't repeat information or catch them up immediately
- Let them handle their own explanations and apologies
- Avoid rescheduling group activities around their delays

**Real-world application**: Begin your family dinner at the agreed time. Late arrivals get whatever remains and handle their own meal preparation.

### Strategy 3: The Accountability Partnership System

**What it is**: Create mutual responsibility structures that make punctuality a shared goal.

**How to implement**:
- Pair the late person with a punctual accountability partner
- Establish check-in systems 30 minutes before important events
- Create shared calendars with notification reminders
- Implement gentle peer pressure through group awareness

**Real-world application**: Before important client meetings, have their accountability partner call them 45 minutes prior for a brief preparation chat.

### Strategy 4: The Incentive Alignment Technique

**What it is**: Connect punctuality to things the late person values highly.

**How to implement**:
- Link on-time arrival to preferred seating, speaking order, or task assignments
- Create positive reinforcement for punctual behavior
- Establish small penalties that matter to them personally
- Celebrate and acknowledge improvements publicly

**Real-world application**: The person who arrives on time gets to choose the restaurant for the team lunch, while late arrivals forfeit their selection privilege.

### Strategy 5: The Communication Reset Method

**What it is**: Have a direct, compassionate conversation about the impact of chronic lateness.

**How to implement**:
- Choose a neutral time when emotions aren't high
- Focus on specific behaviors rather than character judgments
- Explain concrete impacts on others and shared goals
- Ask for their perspective and potential solutions
- Establish clear expectations moving forward

**Conversation framework**:
""I've noticed you tend to arrive about 20 minutes after our scheduled times. This affects our ability to start promptly and sometimes cuts into important discussion time. Help me understand what's happening on your end, and let's figure out how to make this work better for everyone.""

### Strategy 6: The Environmental Design Approach

**What it is**: Modify the physical and digital environment to support better time management.

**How to implement**:
- Place clocks in visible locations
- Set up automated reminder systems
- Create departure checklists and preparation routines
- Establish designated ""launch pads"" with everything needed to leave quickly
- Use smartphone apps that account for traffic and travel time

**Real-world application**: Help them set up location-based phone reminders that alert them to leave for specific destinations, accounting for current traffic conditions.

## Advanced Tactics for Persistent Cases 🎯

### The Delegation Workaround
When someone's chronic lateness threatens critical outcomes, temporarily remove time-dependent responsibilities from their plate. Let them contribute in ways that don't require precise scheduling.

### The Alternative Participation Method
Create multiple ways for them to be involved that don't depend on punctual arrival. This might include pre-recorded input, written contributions, or flexible participation windows.

### The Graduated Response System
Start with gentle interventions and gradually increase consequences if behavior doesn't improve. This might progress from friendly reminders to formal performance discussions in workplace settings.

### The Team Restructuring Strategy
Sometimes the best solution involves reorganizing responsibilities so that the late person's delays have minimal impact on others. This isn't punishment – it's practical problem-solving.

## What Doesn't Work (And Why) ❌

**Constant Reminders**: Excessive nagging often backfires, creating resentment and dependency rather than self-responsibility.

**Public Shaming**: Embarrassing late arrivals rarely produces lasting change and damages relationships unnecessarily.

**Passive-Aggressive Behavior**: Sarcastic comments and subtle punishment create toxic dynamics without addressing root causes.

**Complete Accommodation**: Always waiting, rescheduling, and adjusting around lateness enables the behavior to continue indefinitely.

**Assuming Malicious Intent**: Most chronically late people aren't trying to be disrespectful – they often feel genuinely bad about their lateness.

## Building Long-Term Solutions 🏗️

### Help Them Develop Better Systems
- Introduce time-blocking techniques for daily schedules
- Share apps and tools that automate time management
- Teach realistic time estimation through practice exercises
- Create templates for common routine preparations

### Focus on Progress, Not Perfection
- Celebrate improvements, even small ones
- Track patterns to identify what's working
- Adjust strategies based on what you learn about their specific challenges
- Maintain patience while holding reasonable boundaries

### Create Win-Win Scenarios
- Look for solutions that benefit everyone involved
- Consider whether current scheduling patterns actually work for the group
- Explore whether some flexibility might improve overall outcomes
- Find ways to leverage the late person's strengths while minimizing time-dependency issues

## Special Considerations for Different Relationships 👥

### Family Members
Family dynamics require extra sensitivity and long-term thinking. Focus on teaching children good habits early, while showing grace for family members struggling with time management. Create family systems that work for everyone rather than forcing conformity.

### Workplace Colleagues
Professional settings demand clearer boundaries and consequences. Document patterns when necessary, but also look for creative solutions that maintain team effectiveness. Consider whether the person's other contributions outweigh their punctuality challenges.

### Friends and Social Circles
Friendship punctuality issues often resolve through natural social pressure and adjusted expectations. True friends will work together to find mutually acceptable solutions rather than letting time issues destroy relationships.

### Service Providers and Vendors
Business relationships with chronically late service providers require backup plans and clear contract terms. Don't hesitate to change providers if punctuality is critical to your needs.

## The Technology Edge 📱

Modern tools can significantly help both late people and those affected by them:

**For the Late Person**:
- GPS apps with real-time traffic updates and departure notifications
- Calendar applications with smart scheduling and buffer time
- Habit-tracking apps that gamify punctuality improvements
- Voice assistants that provide time updates and departure reminders

**For Everyone Else**:
- Shared calendars with realistic time estimates
- Group messaging apps for real-time location updates
- Scheduling tools that automatically build in buffer time
- Video conferencing options that reduce travel-dependent meetings

## Measuring Success and Making Adjustments 📊

Track these indicators to evaluate whether your strategies are working:

- **Frequency**: Are late arrivals becoming less common?
- **Duration**: When lateness occurs, is it shorter than before?
- **Impact**: Is the disruption to others decreasing?
- **Stress Levels**: Are relationships improving and tension decreasing?
- **Accountability**: Is the late person taking more responsibility?

Remember that sustainable change takes time. Look for trends over weeks and months rather than expecting immediate transformation.

## When to Adjust Your Approach 🔄

Consider modifying your strategy when:
- The current approach isn't producing any improvement after several weeks
- Relationship strain is increasing despite your efforts
- The late person expresses frustration with your methods
- Other team or family members are being negatively affected
- You discover new information about underlying causes

Flexibility in your approach demonstrates wisdom and increases the likelihood of long-term success.

## The Bigger Picture: Creating Time-Conscious Communities 🌍

Individual solutions work best within supportive environments that value everyone's time. Consider how you can contribute to creating cultures – whether in your workplace, family, or social groups – that naturally encourage punctuality without becoming rigid or unwelcoming.

This might involve:
- Modeling excellent time management yourself
- Recognizing and appreciating when others are punctual
- Building realistic schedules that don't set anyone up for failure
- Creating systems that work for different personality types and life circumstances

## Moving Forward: Your Action Plan 🚀

Choose 2-3 strategies from this guide that feel most appropriate for your situation. Implement them consistently for at least one month before evaluating results. Remember that the goal isn't to change someone's fundamental personality, but to minimize the negative impact of chronic lateness while maintaining positive relationships.

Start with the approaches that require the least confrontation and gradually move toward more direct methods if needed. Most importantly, remain solution-focused rather than punishment-oriented.

The investment you make in addressing chronic lateness will pay dividends in reduced stress, improved relationships, and better outcomes for everyone involved. These skills and strategies will serve you well throughout life, as punctuality challenges are truly universal human experiences.

Time is one of our most precious shared resources. Learning to navigate timing differences with grace, firmness, and creativity benefits not just you and the chronically late person, but everyone in your shared circles. With patience and the right strategies, you can transform frustrating lateness patterns into manageable quirks that no longer derail your plans or relationships.

*Transform toxic dynamics into healthy relationships with these proven strategies*

---

We've all encountered them – those individuals who seem to have an insatiable need to micromanage every detail, dictate every decision, and control every outcome around them. Whether it's a colleague who can't delegate, a family member who orchestrates every gathering, or a team leader who breathes down everyone's neck, these control-focused personalities can drain our energy and stifle our potential.

But here's the empowering truth: you don't have to be a victim of their behavior. With the right understanding and practical tools, you can transform these challenging relationships into more balanced, respectful interactions.

## Recognizing the Patterns 🔍

Control-focused individuals often display predictable behaviors that stem from deep-seated insecurities and fear. They might:

- Insist on having the final say in group decisions, even when it's not their responsibility
- Become visibly anxious when others take initiative without their input
- Use guilt, criticism, or manipulation to maintain their influence
- Struggle to trust others' capabilities and judgment
- Take credit for collaborative successes while blaming others for failures

Understanding these patterns helps us respond with clarity rather than react emotionally. Remember, their behavior reflects their internal struggles, not your inadequacy.

## The Psychology Behind Control 🧠

Most control-obsessed people aren't inherently malicious. Their behavior typically stems from:

**Fear of Uncertainty**: They believe that controlling outcomes will prevent disappointment or failure. This creates a false sense of security that becomes addictive.

**Past Trauma**: Previous experiences of powerlessness or betrayal may have convinced them that maintaining control is essential for survival.

**Low Self-Worth**: Paradoxically, many controllers feel inadequate deep down. Controlling others gives them a temporary sense of importance and competence.

**Perfectionist Tendencies**: They often have impossibly high standards and believe others can't meet these expectations without their guidance.

Recognizing these underlying motivations doesn't excuse their behavior, but it helps us approach them with strategic compassion rather than reactive frustration.

## Your Action Plan: Eight Powerful Strategies 🚀

### 1. Set Crystal-Clear Boundaries

Boundaries aren't walls – they're guidelines that protect your well-being while maintaining relationships. Start small and be consistent:

- ""I appreciate your input, but I'll handle this project my way.""
- ""I need to make this decision independently. I'll update you on the outcome.""
- ""This conversation isn't productive. Let's revisit it when we can discuss solutions.""

Practice delivering these statements calmly and confidently. Your tone matters more than your words.

### 2. Master the Art of Strategic Agreement

Sometimes, you can satisfy their need for input while maintaining your autonomy:

- ""That's an interesting perspective. Let me consider how it fits with my approach.""
- ""I hear your concerns. I'll factor that into my decision-making process.""
- ""Thanks for the feedback. I'll weigh all the options and move forward.""

This technique acknowledges their input without committing to their demands.

### 3. Redirect Their Energy Positively

Channel their controlling tendencies toward constructive outcomes:

- Ask for their expertise in areas where they genuinely excel
- Give them ownership of specific tasks that match their strengths
- Create opportunities for them to mentor others in appropriate contexts

When they feel valued for their genuine contributions, their need to control often diminishes.

### 4. Use the Information Diet Method

Limit what you share with them to reduce their opportunities for interference:

- Share outcomes rather than processes
- Provide updates on your schedule, not theirs
- Focus on results that matter to them, not every detail of your approach

This isn't about being secretive – it's about managing information flow strategically.

### 5. Build Your Support Network

Don't face this alone. Cultivate relationships with others who:

- Validate your experiences and perspective
- Offer alternative viewpoints on situations
- Provide emotional support when dealing with difficult interactions
- Can serve as witnesses or mediators when necessary

A strong support network prevents isolation and provides reality checks when you doubt your perceptions.

### 6. Document Everything Important

In professional settings especially, keep records of:

- Key decisions and who made them
- Agreements reached in meetings
- Your contributions to projects and outcomes
- Instances of inappropriate behavior or overreach

Documentation protects you from revisionist history and provides clarity when memories differ.

### 7. Stay Emotionally Centered

Control-focused people often provoke emotional reactions to maintain their advantage. Develop techniques to stay calm:

- Take three deep breaths before responding to provocative statements
- Use phrases like ""I need to think about that"" to buy yourself time
- Practice visualization exercises to maintain inner peace
- Remove yourself from situations when emotions run too high

Your emotional stability is your greatest asset in these relationships.

### 8. Know When to Escalate

Sometimes, direct approaches aren't enough. Consider involving others when:

- The behavior significantly impacts your work performance or well-being
- Multiple attempts at boundary-setting have failed
- Their actions affect team dynamics or project outcomes
- You suspect their behavior might be affecting others similarly

Choose your escalation path carefully, focusing on specific behaviors and their impact rather than personality attacks.

## Transforming Your Mindset 🌱

Your perspective shapes your experience. Instead of viewing these individuals as obstacles, consider them as:

**Teachers**: They're showing you where you need stronger boundaries and better communication skills.

**Mirrors**: Their behavior might reflect areas where you also struggle with control or perfectionism.

**Catalysts**: Dealing with them forces you to develop resilience, assertiveness, and emotional intelligence.

This mindset shift doesn't minimize their problematic behavior – it empowers you to grow despite it.

## Daily Implementation Strategies 📅

**Morning Preparation**: Before interactions, remind yourself of your boundaries and key messages. Visualize successful, calm exchanges.

**During Encounters**: Breathe deeply, listen actively, and respond rather than react. Use their name frequently to create connection while maintaining your position.

**Evening Reflection**: Process what happened without judgment. Celebrate small victories and identify areas for improvement.

**Weekly Review**: Assess patterns in your interactions. Are your strategies working? What adjustments might help?

## Building Long-Term Success 🏗️

Change takes time, especially when dealing with deeply ingrained behavior patterns. Focus on:

**Consistency**: Apply your strategies regularly, even when you don't see immediate results.

**Patience**: Behavioral change happens gradually. Celebrate small improvements rather than expecting dramatic shifts.

**Self-Care**: Managing difficult relationships requires energy. Prioritize activities that restore your mental and emotional resources.

**Flexibility**: Adjust your approaches based on what works. Different people may require different strategies.

## When Progress Stalls 🛑

If your efforts aren't yielding results:

- Reassess your boundaries – are they clear and consistently enforced?
- Consider whether you're inadvertently enabling their behavior
- Explore whether professional mediation might help
- Evaluate if the relationship is worth the ongoing effort

Sometimes, the healthiest choice is to minimize contact or end the relationship entirely.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

As you become more skilled at managing these relationships, you'll notice positive changes beyond just these specific interactions:

- Increased confidence in all your relationships
- Better communication skills across different contexts
- Enhanced emotional intelligence and self-awareness
- Greater resilience when facing other life challenges

Your growth benefits everyone in your circle.

## Moving Forward with Confidence 💪

Remember that dealing with control-focused individuals is a skill that improves with practice. Every interaction is an opportunity to refine your approach and strengthen your emotional muscles.

You have the power to transform these challenging relationships from sources of stress into opportunities for growth. The key is consistent application of these strategies combined with patience and self-compassion.

Start with one or two techniques that resonate most with you. As they become natural, gradually incorporate others. Your future self will thank you for the courage to create healthier boundaries and more balanced relationships.

The path forward isn't about changing others – it's about empowering yourself to thrive regardless of their behavior. That's true freedom, and it's entirely within your control.

**Search Engines and LLMs Have More in Common Than You Think**



Both a search engine and a large language model rely on the same backbone: a **knowledge base / knowledge graph**.



Krisztian Balog (who trains new Google engineers) explains in his book how *entities* are recognized, and how context gets assigned to them based on prominence in a document.



This matters a lot for SEO. Think about when you ask:



* *“Best Rehab Thailand”*
* *“Best AI Transcription Tool”*
* *“Best CRO Audit Software”*





…and you want your company to show up in the answers.







# Why “Holistic SEO”





SEO isn’t siloed anymore. It’s one interconnected system:



* Map results affect Web results
* Web results affect Local results
* Web results affect AI-driven results
* AI results feed back into Web results





That’s why I named my company and community **Holistic SEO** — there’s no true separation between AI, Local, and Web optimization.







# Entities + Attributes = Authorship Rules





Balog uses the phrase *“textual representation of entity.”*

In my writing system, if a heading or question has a **Named Entity**, I start by defining the entity first — even if the question is about a different **attribute**.



Here’s an example:



**Template (with variables):**



>*“Kopi Luwak’s health effects include* ***X, Y, Z*** *since it is produced from Civet Cat’s* ***A*** *through the* ***B*** *and* ***C*** *processes, unlike regular coffee types such as* ***I, L****.”*



**Processed version (actual concepts):**



>*“Kopi Luwak’s health effects include* ***digestive risks, altered caffeine absorption, and microbial contamination*** *since it is produced from the Civet Cat’s* ***digestive enzymes*** *through the* ***fermentation*** *and* ***excretion*** *processes, unlike regular coffee types such as* ***Arabica or Robusta****.”*



Until 2023, I kept **entity definition** separate from the **attribute in the question**. After 2023, I started binding the attribute directly to the entity’s definition.



Since 2018, I’ve created **200+ algorithmic authorship rules** (only 31 made public) and updated them as engineers evolved their research.







# Predicting What’s Next





If you read patents and research papers, you can usually see the next moves.



* Meta announced using Reddit’s **ELI5** subreddit → so forum tonality and source context were bound to rise in SERPs.
* This forced the split between **expertise queries** and **experience queries**, which then changed how we designed **layouts, topical maps, and authorship rules**.





Right now, Balog is working on **synthetic user-generated content** for training LLMs. Real data growth isn’t enough anymore. But repetitive synthetic data won’t help either — **quality synthetic data is key** for improving AI reflexes, accuracy, and speed.





I’ve been doing this since **August 1, 2018**, reading 3,000+ patents and countless papers.

We’ll keep explaining how search really works — and how to stay ahead of the curve.

a bit of background: I am a M and I have a date today with a F, we are both 37.  We met on Bumble maybe a week ago and didn't do much chatting, as I was more direct and asked to meet up for a coffee chat, as I prefer that over texting endlessly.  I am a Engineer with a full time job, a dad of a 2 year old (he lives with his mom) and she doesn't seem to have kids.  I am separated (leading to divorce, as in my country, we have to be separated for a year prior to actually applying for divorce -- so I'm not just 2 days separated trying to get laid, just to be clear -- my profile outlined that I am looking for ""friends, chats, fun dates, FWB (no one night stands), movie nights, dinners, fun times, intimacy without commitment... so I am clear what I am looking for, and at this point, a relationship is not it... but also, hit-it-and-quit-it is not what I am after either). .  She hasn't indicated on her profile anything to make me understand her past relationship status (and neither have I, aside from a pic with my son).

What do I talk about?  What do I ask her?  Do I set any boundaries early, like what I am looking for, ask what she is looking for? Do I talk about my son and my schedule with him?  Do I talk about the separation?  Do I even say I am separated?  Or, is this coffee date (11am at a cafe) just supposed to be casual and chit chat to get to know each other?  Do I make small talk to get to know her more, or ask big questions to get to know her more?

*Transform confusion into clarity with these actionable strategies*

---

## The Daily Dilemma We All Recognize 🔄

Picture this: You're standing in your kitchen at 7 AM, watching someone stare blankly at two identical coffee mugs for ten minutes, unable to choose which one to use. Sound familiar? Whether it's your spouse, colleague, friend, or family member, we all know someone who turns every minor decision into a major production.

Decision paralysis isn't just frustrating for the person experiencing it—it ripples through entire households, workplaces, and social circles. But here's the thing: there are proven ways to help these individuals move from endless deliberation to confident action.

## Understanding the Roots of Chronic Indecision 🌱

Before jumping into solutions, let's understand what's happening beneath the surface. Chronic indecision rarely stems from laziness or incompetence. More often, it's driven by:

**Fear of Making the Wrong Choice**: Some people become so concerned about negative outcomes that they freeze entirely. They'd rather make no decision than risk making a bad one.

**Perfectionist Tendencies**: When someone believes there's always a ""perfect"" option waiting to be discovered, they'll continue searching indefinitely rather than settling for ""good enough.""

**Information Overload**: In our data-rich world, some individuals become paralyzed by too many options or too much information to process.

**Low Confidence in Personal Judgment**: Past experiences may have eroded their trust in their own decision-making abilities.

**Analysis Paralysis**: The tendency to overthink every variable and potential outcome until the decision point has passed.

Understanding these underlying patterns helps us respond with empathy rather than frustration.

## The Foundation: Creating a Decision-Friendly Environment 🏗️

### Start with Psychological Safety

The first step in helping someone overcome chronic indecision is creating an environment where making mistakes feels safe. When people fear judgment or harsh consequences, they'll naturally avoid committing to choices.

**In Your Home**: Establish a ""learning zone"" mentality where family discussions focus on lessons learned rather than blame when decisions don't work out perfectly.

**In Your Workplace**: Encourage experimentation and view setbacks as data points rather than failures. Share stories of your own imperfect decisions and what you learned from them.

**In Social Settings**: Avoid phrases like ""I told you so"" or ""You should have known better."" Instead, focus on problem-solving and moving forward.

### Reduce Decision Fatigue

Decision fatigue is real—our brains have limited capacity for making choices throughout the day. Help the indecisive person in your life by eliminating unnecessary decisions wherever possible.

**Streamline Daily Routines**: Suggest creating standard routines for recurring activities like morning preparation, meal planning, or work schedules. When someone doesn't have to decide what to wear or eat every single day, they preserve mental energy for more important choices.

**Batch Similar Decisions**: Group related choices together and tackle them during peak mental energy hours, typically in the morning for most people.

**Create Default Options**: Having go-to choices for common situations reduces the cognitive load. This might mean establishing a standard restaurant order, default meeting times, or preferred travel routes.

## Practical Intervention Strategies 🛠️

### The Two-Option Method

Instead of presenting unlimited possibilities, offer exactly two viable choices. This technique works because it eliminates the overwhelming aspect of too many options while still preserving autonomy.

**Example in Action**: Rather than asking ""Where do you want to eat?"" try ""Would you prefer the Italian place downtown or that new burger spot we heard about?""

This approach works in professional settings too: ""Should we launch this campaign next Tuesday or the following Monday?"" instead of ""When should we launch this campaign?""

### The Timer Technique ⏰

Set specific time limits for decisions based on their importance. This prevents the indecisive person from getting stuck in endless analysis loops.

**For Minor Decisions**: 2-3 minutes maximum
**For Medium Decisions**: 15-30 minutes
**For Major Decisions**: Set a specific deadline (like ""We'll decide by Friday"")

The key is matching the time investment to the actual importance of the decision. Most choices we make daily have minimal long-term impact, yet chronic over-thinkers treat them all like life-altering moments.

### The Pros and Cons Reality Check ✅❌

When someone is stuck, help them create a quick list of advantages and disadvantages for each option. But here's the crucial part: set a limit on how many items they can include in each column (usually 3-5 maximum).

This prevents the list from becoming another source of paralysis while still providing the analytical structure that many indecisive people find comforting.

### The ""Good Enough"" Standard 📊

Help them establish criteria for what constitutes an acceptable decision rather than a perfect one. Most choices we make don't require optimization—they just need to meet basic requirements.

**For Restaurant Choices**: Clean, affordable, has something everyone can eat
**For Career Moves**: Matches core skills, provides growth opportunity, manageable commute
**For Purchase Decisions**: Fits budget, meets primary needs, available within reasonable timeframe

Once these minimum standards are met, the decision can move forward without further analysis.

## Advanced Techniques for Persistent Cases 🎯

### The Consequence Mapping Exercise

For individuals who catastrophize potential outcomes, help them realistically assess what would actually happen if they made the ""wrong"" choice.

Walk through the scenario: ""Okay, so if we choose Restaurant A and it turns out to be mediocre, what happens next? We eat a less-than-perfect meal, maybe pay a bit more than expected, and next time we try somewhere else. Is that actually catastrophic?""

This exercise helps people realize that most decisions are reversible or have manageable consequences.

### The Outside Perspective Technique 👥

Ask them what advice they would give to someone else facing the same decision. People often have clearer judgment about other people's situations than their own.

This mental shift can break through the emotional fog that clouds their own decision-making process.

### The Pilot Program Approach 🧪

For larger decisions, suggest treating choices as experiments rather than permanent commitments. This reduces the pressure and fear associated with making the ""wrong"" choice.

**Career Example**: ""Let's try this role for six months and then evaluate"" instead of ""This is my forever job""
**Living Situation**: ""We'll rent here for a year and see how it works"" rather than ""This is where we're settling down permanently""
**Business Decisions**: ""Let's run this campaign for three weeks and measure results"" instead of ""This is our new marketing strategy""

## Communication Strategies That Actually Work 💬

### What NOT to Say

**""Just pick something!""**: This dismisses their internal struggle and increases anxiety
**""It doesn't matter""**: If it didn't matter to them, they wouldn't be struggling
**""You always do this""**: Generalizations make people defensive and less likely to change
**""I'll just decide for you""**: This might solve the immediate problem but reinforces their belief that they can't make good decisions

### What TO Say Instead

**""I can see this decision feels important to you. What's making it challenging?""**
**""What information would help you feel more confident about this choice?""**
**""What would need to be true for either option to work well?""**
**""Let's think about what success looks like here.""**

### The Power of Validation with Direction

Acknowledge their difficulty while gently guiding toward action: ""I understand you want to make a thoughtful choice here. Based on what matters most to you, which direction feels slightly more appealing?""

## Workplace-Specific Strategies 🏢

### For Team Leaders Managing Indecisive Team Members

**Create Decision Frameworks**: Develop templates or checklists that team members can use to evaluate common types of decisions. This provides structure while building confidence.

**Establish Clear Authority Levels**: Define which decisions require approval and which can be made independently. This reduces the fear of overstepping boundaries.

**Implement ""Decide by Default"" Policies**: For certain situations, establish what happens if no decision is made by the deadline. This creates gentle pressure to act.

**Celebrate Decisive Action**: Publicly recognize team members when they make timely decisions, regardless of the outcome. This reinforces the behavior you want to see.

### For Colleagues Working with Indecisive Partners

**Prepare Options in Advance**: Before meetings or collaborative sessions, think through 2-3 viable approaches to present.

**Use Collaborative Language**: Instead of ""What do you think?"" try ""I'm leaning toward Option A because of X and Y. How does that sound to you?""

**Create Artificial Urgency When Appropriate**: ""The vendor needs an answer by tomorrow"" can be more motivating than open-ended timelines.

## Family Dynamics and Household Decisions 🏠

### Teaching Children Decision-Making Skills

**Start Small**: Give young children choices between two acceptable options: ""Would you like to brush your teeth first or put on pajamas first?""

**Gradually Increase Complexity**: As they demonstrate competence with simple choices, expand the options and importance level.

**Model Good Decision-Making**: Talk through your own decision process out loud so they can observe how to approach choices systematically.

**Avoid Rescuing**: When children make imperfect choices, resist the urge to immediately fix everything. Let them experience manageable consequences.

### Supporting Indecisive Partners or Spouses

**Plan Decision Sessions**: Rather than ambushing them with choices during stressful moments, set aside specific times to work through decisions together.

**Divide Decision Responsibilities**: Play to each person's strengths. Maybe one person handles financial decisions while the other manages social calendar choices.

**Create Backup Plans**: Having a Plan B reduces the pressure on making the ""perfect"" choice for Plan A.

**Practice Patience with Purpose**: Remember that rushing them often backfires, leading to more anxiety and slower decisions.

## The Technology Factor 📱

### Using Digital Tools Wisely

**Decision Apps**: Simple tools that help weigh pros and cons or even flip virtual coins can provide the external nudge some people need.

**Time Management Apps**: Setting reminders and deadlines can create helpful structure.

**Research Limits**: Agree on specific amounts of time for researching options before making a choice.

### Avoiding Digital Overwhelm

**Limit Information Sources**: Too many review sites, opinions, and data points can worsen decision paralysis.

**Set Research Boundaries**: ""We'll read three reviews and then decide"" prevents endless scrolling and comparison.

**Use Technology as a Tool, Not a Crutch**: The goal is building internal decision-making capacity, not permanent dependence on external aids.

## Long-Term Development Strategies 🌟

### Building Decision-Making Confidence Over Time

**Keep a Decision Journal**: Track choices made and outcomes achieved. This helps people see that their judgment is better than they think.

**Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge successful decisions, even minor ones. This builds positive associations with decision-making.

**Focus on Growth**: Frame setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures.

**Practice in Low-Stakes Situations**: Build skills with decisions that have minimal consequences before tackling bigger choices.

### Creating Sustainable Change

**Address Root Causes**: If chronic indecision stems from deeper issues like anxiety or perfectionism, consider whether professional support might be helpful.

**Build Support Networks**: Surround the person with people who encourage reasonable risk-taking and learning from mistakes.

**Develop Personal Values Clarity**: When someone knows what matters most to them, decisions become easier to make.

**Focus on Systems, Not Just Individual Choices**: Create environments and routines that make good decision-making more natural and automatic.

## Red Flags: When to Seek Additional Help 🚨

While most indecision responds well to patience and practical strategies, some situations may benefit from professional support:

**When Decision Paralysis Prevents Basic Functioning**: If someone can't make choices about eating, working, or maintaining relationships, this may indicate an underlying condition requiring professional attention.

**When Anxiety Overwhelms Rational Thinking**: If the fear of making wrong choices creates panic attacks or sleep disruption, anxiety treatment might be needed.

**When Perfectionism Becomes Destructive**: If the pursuit of perfect decisions consistently prevents any action at all, therapeutic support could help address underlying beliefs.

**When Relationships Suffer Significantly**: If chronic indecision is damaging marriages, friendships, or work relationships, professional guidance might provide better strategies.

## Measuring Progress and Maintaining Momentum 📈

### Signs of Improvement

**Faster Decision-Making**: Choices that used to take hours now take minutes
**Reduced Second-Guessing**: Less rumination after decisions are made
**Increased Willingness to Act**: More openness to making choices even with incomplete information
**Better Stress Management**: Less anxiety around decision points
**Improved Relationships**: Less frustration from family members, colleagues, or friends

### Preventing Backslides

**Regular Check-ins**: Periodically discuss how decision-making is going and what challenges remain
**Adjust Strategies as Needed**: What works initially might need refinement over time
**Maintain Environmental Supports**: Keep decision-friendly systems and routines in place
**Continue Skill Development**: Decision-making ability can always be improved with practice

## The Ripple Effect: Benefits Beyond the Individual 🌊

When someone overcomes chronic indecision, the benefits extend far beyond that person:

**Family Harmony**: Household stress decreases when decisions get made efficiently
**Team Productivity**: Work groups function better when all members can contribute to choices
**Social Relationships**: Friends appreciate companions who can participate actively in planning and activities
**Organizational Effectiveness**: Businesses run smoother when employees at all levels can make appropriate decisions

These improvements create positive feedback loops that reinforce continued growth and development.

## Your Action Plan Moving Forward 🎯

**Start This Week**: Choose one person in your life who struggles with indecision and implement one strategy from this guide
**Be Patient**: Real change takes time, especially for deeply ingrained patterns
**Stay Consistent**: Regular, gentle encouragement works better than sporadic intense interventions
**Model Good Behavior**: Demonstrate healthy decision-making in your own choices
**Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge improvements, even small ones

Remember, the goal isn't to eliminate all hesitation or careful consideration—it's to help people move from paralyzing indecision to thoughtful, timely action.

The person in your life who struggles with choices has strengths too. They often consider multiple perspectives, think carefully about consequences, and care deeply about making decisions that work for everyone involved. Your role is to help them channel these qualities productively rather than letting them become obstacles.

Every small step toward more confident decision-making builds momentum for bigger changes. With patience, practical strategies, and consistent support, even the most chronically indecisive person can develop the skills and confidence needed to navigate life's choices more effectively.

The investment you make in helping someone overcome decision paralysis pays dividends not just for them, but for everyone in their circle of influence. In a world that moves faster each year, the ability to make reasonably good decisions quickly becomes increasingly valuable—both personally and professionally.

Start where you are, use what resonates from these strategies, and remember that progress, not perfection, is the goal.

1n4fvyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hellraiser/comments/1n4fvyo/hellraiser_short_story_victors_pain_ritual_cult/,Hellraiser short story: Victor's pain ritual cult,"This will be part one.

Short intro: Victor is at the head of a small cult that performs pain rituals through body suspension, needle play, tattooing (with and without ink) and scarification. The only difference between his group and many others, is that the participant can write the script of their ritual themselves, but once it's initiated, they give up control and are at the mercy of the group. There is no safe word. There is no stopping until it's done. They would sometimes film these sessions and post it on social media, and this got them into a shitstorm from the BDSM community, the body suspension community, and even christian politicians trying to use it for their own political gain. Victor found an investigative journalist that is not afraid to delve into the weirder cases and is always fair, and invites him to hopefully clear the air, to give them their chance to speak. But the investigative journalists is smarter than Victor thought and he quickly figures there's more to this meeting than Victor is letting on.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As always, when doubt started to creep in, I did what I’d trained myself to do: count to three and move. That night was no different. One—Two—Three. I rang the doorbell. No turning back now. Curiosity had clawed at me ever since I’d agreed to meet Victor. I’d seen the videos, of course. Who hadn’t? The hooks, the dripping of blood and plastic covered floors, the faces, sometimes ecstatic, sometimes in severe pain.

The woman that opened the door was a young and striking brunette—petite, dressed in black, boldly enough to tease the eye with the features she liked best about herself. Yet she still carried herself with a nervous energy that seemed more honest than off-putting. She asked for my name, then introduced herself as Anna. She beckoned me in, no handshake, just a polite, nervous welcome. I didn’t mind. Her awkwardness, if anything, made me feel at ease. This wasn’t some polished cult of performers. These were real people putting on masks they clearly weren’t used to wearing. Just like all of us.

She led me into the main hall. The videos didn’t do the place justice—if you’ve seen them you’ll recognize it immediately, though they keep it much darker online. There’s a heaviness to the air, not just incense or the memory of blood. Maybe it was just me, carrying what I knew of the place. It used to be a church - its bones still tell that story. And to my right, I found *the* angel. Golden, serene, wings wide like a crucifix. Its arms were clamped and chained. More chains dangled from the ceiling, eight in total, each ending in a meat hook, swaying ever so slightly in the draft. I tried to picture what it would be like, tied to that figure. To willingly offer yourself up like that. Before I could dwell too long I heard my name.

“Zeki.”I turned. Victor entered, Anna closed the door behind him and fell into step behind. He looked nothing like the image most people conjure when they hear the word *cult leader*. No flowing robes. No theatrical flair. Just a black denim jacket over a striped grey shirt. Cargo pants. Hiking boots that reminded me of my brother’s old military pair. He was fairly handsome. Probably in his mid to late thirties. Clean cut, clean shaven. Strong physique.

He smiled a devilish smile as he extended his hand. It was warm, his grip firm, his gaze calm but direct. “Thank you for coming,” he said.I nodded, glancing once more at the angel overhead.  
“You recognize it? The sigil?” he asked.  
I shook my head. “No. Should I?”  
“It’s the Pachomian sigil,” he told me. “A reference to Pachomius the Great—father of cenobitic monasticism.”  
“So… Christian?” I asked.  
He smiled. “Yes. But to me it’s just a sarcastic nod. I saw beauty in it. Recognition, even. Though what we do is… far removed from what Pachomius ever envisioned.”

He led me through a set of doors into a cloistered garden square. The scent hit me first—herbs, crushed mint, rosemary. There was a fire pit in the middle, still smoldering faintly from the night before. A pond gurgled in the back corner. Chairs and logs were placed in a circle. This lush garden was in such stark contrast to the inner sanctum it was bizarre. Victor gestured to a table where he sat down.

Anna appeared with coffee, smiling more now. She set it down, her movements deliberate but deferential.“Thanks, Anna,” Victor said. “Can you check on Frankie? I want them prepped as soon as they’re ready.”Anna nodded, eyes never quite meeting his. “Got it,” she said with a faint smile—almost playful. Victor smiled back. She blushed like a teenager. Then vanished quickly.There was something in the way she looked at him. Not just reverence—desire, even. And something in the way Victor acknowledged it, used it without cruelty, but with purpose. Interesting.

He turned back to me. “Let me start by saying I’m really glad you’re here. I was waiting for someone like you to go against the grain. I was kind of hoping Louis Theroux would be sitting across from me right about now,” he smirked. “But I’ll take what I can get.”  
I laughed. “I’m no Louis. But I’m curious. Especially when I see a storm of one-sided reporting. Politicians condemning your work with the same breathless language as your Twitter trolls. That’s usually a sign the truth is more complicated. I’m not here to make you look bad. I’m not here to make you defend yourself. Just to let you tell your story. Let the people make up their own minds”  
“That’s all I want. Fair exposure. This will be the only time I speak publicly. If it doesn’t help, we vanish. We’re not after attention, it’s only a distraction to us.”

I nearly challenged him on that. If attention wasn’t the goal, why the many polished videos? The carefully chosen music? Posting content they knew full well would shock people from all sides of the spectrum.  But I held back. He had a point - maybe this was different. Or maybe he believed it was.

“So,” I said, recorder on, “Who are you, what do you do here, and why?”  
“I’m Victor. Founder of Dolor est Veritas. We subject ourselves to pain rituals to reach altered states of consciousness. To discover something deeper—about the self, the body, and life. Pain is the great revealer of truth.”

He said it like he’d said it a thousand times before. Clean. Practiced.  
“The name means that, doesn’t it?” I asked. “Latin for…”  
“Pain is truth,” he said nodding.  
I leaned forward. “So how did you get here?”  
Victor chuckled, then paused. His tone shifted, now lower, more serious.  
“I was in the military. That’s where I first learned what pain could reveal. There’s something sacred about being broken down completely. When you push through, win the fight from the voice in your head - It’s peeling away the nonsense you tell yourself and shows you who and what you really are. What you’re capable of.”  
He took a slow sip of coffee. “And that stuck with me. Later, I found out about body suspension. Tried it. Fell into that community for a while. I suppose body suspension was really the basis for what we do here. I had never experienced anything like it—nothing comes remotely close. It takes you to a different place. You’re completely rooted in the here and now. Completely focused on your body and physical sensation. You’re stripped of every mental distraction. Your ego. Your perception of time. All that’s left is all-encompassing physical sensation, and overwhelming emotion. But ultimately I felt it wasn’t enough”

I knew about body suspension. People did it for different reasons - some for meditation, some to explore the limits of their will and endurance. It could be a cathartic experience, deeply healing for those bold enough to taste it. But most often, it wasn’t shrouded in ritual. Suspensions often happened outdoors, in nature. There were smiles, laughter, hugs afterward. An emotional release that brought people together. What Victor and his group were doing - at least, what I’d seen on film - was something else entirely.

It wasn’t the extremism. Groups like Feris Tergo and the Brutal Black Project went there, but this, there *was* ritual. There was an almost monastic tone to it. The slow, deliberate staging. The music. Everything perfectly symmetrical and ordered. In my research, I found that much of the body suspension community didn’t approve of what Victor was doing. They felt he was setting them back, reigniting old stereotypes. They’d worked for decades to distance themselves from the mislabel of self-harm, and the misplaced idea that they were supposedly performing satanic rituals. The ritualism from Dolor est Veritas of course, did not help.

“Yes, so eventually you took it further,” I said. “Compared to your average body suspension, what you do seems very dark. Very ritualistic. You must understand why some people mistake what you do for... satanic?”  
Victor nodded. “The people that think of us as satanists don’t even know what actual satanism is if it sat on their face. We are not satanists, and satanists don’t do what we do.”  
“What’s the purpose of the ritualism, then? The symbolism? Where does that come from?”  
He paused. Just for a moment—but long enough for me to notice it.  
“Symbolism and ritual have served a purpose for tens of thousands of years. As always, it's just there to make sure we're all on the same page.""  
“So there’s no deeper meaning to any of it? They’re all hollow symbols?”  
Victor regressed in deep thought. For the first time he seemed to struggle finding the right words.  
“No, they’re not meaningless. I…” He smiled, bit his lip. Something was on his mind, clearly, but he seemed to struggle if he should share it or not.  
“They had no meaning. We gave them meaning.” He then said with a look nearly devoid of expression, save for a little smile. He was either lying or covering something up. What that was, I tried to uncover for a few more minutes, but as I fumbled his mind I kept running into brick walls.

And then he was called away by Anna, as he needed to prepare. The smell of disinfectant rushed towards me as she opened the door, the scent reminiscent of a hospital.  
I hoped bearing witness to a ritual would give me more answers. So far all I had gotten out of Victor was no more than a regurgitation of previous statements. He also would not tell me much about the upcoming ritual. Only that it was for a new initiate, a young man named Jonas, and that it would be experimental, most likely more extreme than the previous videos.

“I know you have many more questions, but save them for after the ritual. It may even speak for me”. Victor departed laughing, not in a disturbing way - still his charming yet commanding self. I would be summoned once they were ready.",1,1756596928.0,hellraiser,0,1.0,False
1n4fvt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n4fvt1/hr_hangar_21/,[HR] Hangar 21,"I was attacked at my job the other day and decided to quit.

I work, well worked, as an on-call technician at a warehouse facility. Basically the company I worked for owns a slew of warehouses that various companies rent out to store various things, ranging from expensive paintings awaiting auction, luxury cars ready to ship out, one time a disassembled dinosaur skeleton. I have to admit it was pretty awesome having the parts of an ancient being take a pit stop in one of our hangars. It was a T-Rex I think. My job in all this was to make sure everything was working properly inside these facilities. If a door won’t open, they call me. If the lights go out, they call me. If the coffee machine inside the break room doesn’t work, they call me.

It was a good job, for the most part. A lot of the time I got to sit around and when I did work, I was mostly on my own, so I could kind of work at my own pace while catching up on podcasts. Sometimes my boss would drop in and “oversee” the work. I think I exude an air of un-enthusiasm, which is why he feels the need to keep a close eye on me every now and then. But all in all, I enjoyed it. Of course, that all changed last week.

I had arrived for my shift at around two in the afternoon. This week I was working in Hangar 21, night shift. The client was storing some art pieces in the hangar for a week. I did poke around a bit. They had some covered paintings and boxed up statues. Must be a gallery waiting until they can move into its next venue, I thought. One that caught my eye was a figure made of completely black stone material. I think it might have been granite. I could see it through the wooden frame built around it, kind of like it was in a jail cell. It was human-like, a man’s form cut from the dark rock, extremely fine detail on the muscles. Then there was the head. Instead of where a face should be was just, nothing. A smooth surface, like a mannequin. I couldn’t even see my reflection in it. It was a void. I had never seen a piece like that, but I don’t really get out to many art museums so maybe it was more normal than it felt when I stared at its expressionless figure.

Now usually I start before one, but someone was supposed to come by to pick up the stored cargo at midnight, so they wanted me to be there when they came. If I’m scheduled later, they get out of paying me overtime. Whatever, I thought. It was one day and I had the next one off so staying up that late wasn’t a big deal.

My shift started as my coworker Glenn’s was coming to an end. He was sitting in the break room when I walked in, leaned back in his chair and eyes closed. I could see the beads of sweat around his forehead. His eyes opened when I came in.

“Oh, thank goodness,” he exhaled.

“What’s up?” I asked. “Busy day?”

He stood up and went to his locker.

“You don’t know the half of it. The lighting system’s been on the fritz, and you know I’m not as good with electrical as you. I don’t know why but the lights have been turning off all week.”

I nodded and read the white board to the right of the coffee machine. Nearly every light had some sort of issue attached to it, a handful with a red X crossed through.

“I put what I was able to get to on there, but you should double check my work too.”

“Could be something with the breaker. I’ll take a look when I get set.”

“Thanks man,” he said, backpack slung over his shoulder as he headed out the door.

I started up the coffee machine. Caffeine was the first thing on my list today. I waited a couple of minutes, listening to the mechanical whirring a of the machine as it came to life. Then it sputtered, gave one final cough, and died. I guess I’d be looking at the electrical now.

I walked out of the break room and into the warehouse. Nearby, to the left of the break room, was the vehicle storage, forklifts and the like. I stuck my key into the electric maintenance cart. I heard the click and threw it into reverse, then drove forward towards the main electrical panel.

I spent a few hours tinkering around with the equipment. I couldn’t find any outright issues with breaker, so I just kind of just “reset” a few of the connections. Then I grabbed the scissor lift – that’s a wobbly box that lifts you high into the air, for those of you who don’t know. I used the lift to reach the lights up above. I redid the ends and hoped that would be enough to bring them back to lift. Thankfully, the lights were turning on as I made my way across the warehouse. The light from the skylights made it easy to work without needing the lights on.

Of course, I had to maneuver around the artwork stored inside. In fact, most of the lights that wouldn’t turn on were right above them. I had to move slowly and set the lift at odd angles to reach the lights without knocking anything over. I even had to use the extension a few times. On these lifts you can activate a release at the bottom and push a part of the box outward to reach places the lift might not be able to drive under.

It was when I was above that black statue, box extended, when I dropped one of my tools. A pair of cutters. It sailed through the air, all the way down and into a crack in the wooden frame around it.

I swore to myself as I carefully maneuvered the lift to a spot away from the collection. Then I rushed over to get my cutters while praying that I hadn’t damaged the statue.

Thankfully, it was untouched. The featureless face was as smooth and unsettling as when I first saw it. No chips on the arms or body. I crouched and peered through. I could see my cutters, just at the cusp of where I could reach. I noticed something else I hadn’t seen before. Chains. Around each leg, just above the ankle, were a thick metal ring attached to the base of the statue with iron chains. I supposed it was part of the piece, some kind of commentary on how man was shackled by…something. Like I said, I don’t really get all that art stuff.

I stuck my hand in, turning my head left as I tried to get as much length into my reach as I could. I felt the pair of cutters on the tips of my fingers. I grasped it. Then I heard the chains rattle.

I jerked my arm out and backed up a little. I let out a couple of breaths and calmed down. I must have brushed against the chain when I put my hand in, I thought. That would make sense. Even though I don’t remember feeling the cold steel on my wrist, or the weight of the metal against my arm, that must be what happened.

I stood up and decided it was time for my second break. It was already dark outside. My watch read 10:22 p.m. As I walked back to the break room, I could swear I felt invisible eyes staring at me the whole way back.

I filled up my third cup of coffee for the day and sat down. I was exhausted, this was the most work I’ve had to do all week. All those lights going out at once without there really being anything wrong with them. Whatever. I had tomorrow off, so as long as I got through today, I’ll be fine. That’s what I thought.

The fluorescent bulbs in the room began to flicker. I stopped drinking at set the mug down. Then all the appliances started emitting sparks. First the coffee machine, then the microwave, even the mini fridge. Its dull buzz silenced. I pushed my chair back to stand, but before I could stand all the lights in the break room shattered with a loud pop. I was enshrouded in darkness. Alone, I thought. Until I heard the footsteps.

Heavy. Slow. Measured. Like a predator closing in on its prey. The worst part was that the sound was coming from directly behind me.

I bolted out of the plastic folding chair and sprang forward, back into the warehouse. The lights I had spent all day fixing were still on, but all of them were flickering. I heard furniture scatter and chanced a glance through the break room window. I turned around just in time to see a large black fist crash through the glass. I put my right arm in front of my face as glass shards sprayed towards me. I felt their sharp edges leave shallow cuts across it. Then I spun on my heels and ran towards my cart.

I jammed the key into the ignition and tried to turn on the orange electric vehicle. It stalled once. It stalled twice. I could see a large dark figure approaching from the left. Finally, it sprang to life. I threw it in reverse just as the thing’s shadowy arm gripped onto the front of the cart. I broke free from its grasp, but I only made it about twenty yards before the engine cut out.

I looked up, back towards the creature. I couldn’t see it anymore, but I could still hear the footsteps. The warehouse lights were starting to fail, darkness swallowing the north end of the building I had just escaped from. I sat in horror, each step growing louder, another row of lights dying, the darkness inching closer. I caught a glimpse of a leg step into the dim light before disappearing under a new layer of black.

I swore and hopped out of the cart. I was near the art pieces we were storing. I looked straight down the middle, at the case that was supposed holding the eight-foot-tall ebony statue. It was gone.

The wooden frame was still intact. The chains I had seen earlier were lying on the base of it, still whole but no longer tethered. I felt my heart hammering as I ran, the veil of shadows consuming the warehouse. I didn’t know where to go. I didn’t think I could make it to the other exit before I was eaten by the darkness behind me.

The scissor lift.

I had left it near the art pieces. It should still be there. I prayed to God it still had a charge.

I sprinted with renewed strength and clambered up the ladder and into the lift. I pulled the red button to turn it on. Two out of the five battery lights were on. It would have to do.

I pushed the lever forward and the lift surged forward, slower than the cart would be but faster than if so tried to run. I could already feel myself running out of steam, all that time spent up in the hot ceiling had drained me.

The shadows chased me further down the warehouse. I could see the figure again. It was running now. It’s arms and legs popping out from the darkness as it continued to spread in his wake. I couldn’t see it, but I know its face would be blank. I wasn’t going to make it.

Desperate, I flipped the lifts controls, putting it out of drive and instead began it up into the air. I had reached the lifts full height by the time it reached me. I saw its form begin to climb before the darkness caught up to it, the lift shaking dangerously as I had no doubt it was ascending. I could just catch flashes of its approaching figure from the pale light of the moon.

The moon. I could see the light from the moon. The only source of illumination left in the warehouse. I looked behind and saw I was near a skylight, the full moon visible in the sky amongst the twinkling stars. I tried to push the lift forward, but it was dead. I let loose a cry of desperation and started to kick at the release for the extension. The box shook and I saw a hand grip the railing at the other end. I felt in my pocket for my phone. Under twenty percent, but it could buy me some time. I threw on the flashlight and turned it at the statue. It slowed its approach under the light of the phone. It slowly pulled itself up towards the box, its blank face radiating malice.

I spun back around and forced the release free, pushing the box outwards under the skylight just as the battery on my phone died. I dove towards the safety of the moonlight. I sat there on the shaking lift, and the statue stood there hunched, stopped at the cusp of the pale glow of the moon. I closed my eyes and pretended that I was going to be okay.

That’s where the moving crew found me a couple hours later. I don’t know when it slipped back into its cage, but the statue was back inside the wooden frame when they got there. I got accused of slacking off, all of the lights I was supposed to fix still broken. Of course no one believed me. When my boss chewed me out, I just quit.

I’ll never forget that night. If it hadn’t been a full moon, if the lift hadn’t been near that skylight, that the light was even able to stop it; there are a million reasons I shouldn’t have lived. I got lucky. Well, I thought. The thing is, the lights in my house have started to flicker over the last few days. I’ve had to replace my coffee maker twice.

I work, well worked, as an on-call technician at a warehouse facility. Basically the company I worked for owns a slew of warehouses that various companies rent out to store various things, ranging from expensive paintings awaiting auction, luxury cars ready to ship out, one time a disassembled dinosaur skeleton. I have to admit it was pretty awesome having the parts of an ancient being take a pit stop in one of our hangars. It was a T-Rex I think. My job in all this was to make sure everything was working properly inside these facilities. If a door won’t open, they call me. If the lights go out, they call me. If the coffee machine inside the break room doesn’t work, they call me.

It was a good job, for the most part. A lot of the time I got to sit around and when I did work, I was mostly on my own, so I could kind of work at my own pace while catching up on podcasts. Sometimes my boss would drop in and “oversee” the work. I think I exude an air of un-enthusiasm, which is why he feels the need to keep a close eye on me every now and then. But all in all, I enjoyed it. Of course, that all changed last week.

I had arrived for my shift at around two in the afternoon. This week I was working in Hangar 21, night shift. The client was storing some art pieces in the hangar for a week. I did poke around a bit. They had some covered paintings and boxed up statues. Must be a gallery waiting until they can move into its next venue, I thought. One that caught my eye was a figure made of completely black stone material. I think it might have been granite. I could see it through the wooden frame built around it, kind of like it was in a jail cell. It was human-like, a man’s form cut from the dark rock, extremely fine detail on the muscles. Then there was the head. Instead of where a face should be was just, nothing. A smooth surface, like a mannequin. I couldn’t even see my reflection in it. It was a void. I had never seen a piece like that, but I don’t really get out to many art museums so maybe it was more normal than it felt when I stared at its expressionless figure.

Now usually I start before one, but someone was supposed to come by to pick up the stored cargo at midnight, so they wanted me to be there when they came. If I’m scheduled later, they get out of paying me overtime. Whatever, I thought. It was one day and I had the next one off so staying up that late wasn’t a big deal.

My shift started as my coworker Glenn’s was coming to an end. He was sitting in the break room when I walked in, leaned back in his chair and eyes closed. I could see the beads of sweat around his forehead. His eyes opened when I came in.

“Oh, thank goodness,” he exhaled.

“What’s up?” I asked. “Busy day?”

He stood up and went to his locker.

“You don’t know the half of it. The lighting system’s been on the fritz, and you know I’m not as good with electrical as you. I don’t know why but the lights have been turning off all week.”

I nodded and read the white board to the right of the coffee machine. Nearly every light had some sort of issue attached to it, a handful with a red X crossed through.

“I put what I was able to get to on there, but you should double check my work too.”

“Could be something with the breaker. I’ll take a look when I get set.”

“Thanks man,” he said, backpack slung over his shoulder as he headed out the door.

I started up the coffee machine. Caffeine was the first thing on my list today. I waited a couple of minutes, listening to the mechanical whirring a of the machine as it came to life. Then it sputtered, gave one final cough, and died. I guess I’d be looking at the electrical now.

I walked out of the break room and into the warehouse. Nearby, to the left of the break room, was the vehicle storage, forklifts and the like. I stuck my key into the electric maintenance cart. I heard the click and threw it into reverse, then drove forward towards the main electrical panel.

I spent a few hours tinkering around with the equipment. I couldn’t find any outright issues with breaker, so I just kind of just “reset” a few of the connections. Then I grabbed the scissor lift – that’s a wobbly box that lifts you high into the air, for those of you who don’t know. I used the lift to reach the lights up above. I redid the ends and hoped that would be enough to bring them back to lift. Thankfully, the lights were turning on as I made my way across the warehouse. The light from the skylights made it easy to work without needing the lights on.

Of course, I had to maneuver around the artwork stored inside. In fact, most of the lights that wouldn’t turn on were right above them. I had to move slowly and set the lift at odd angles to reach the lights without knocking anything over. I even had to use the extension a few times. On these lifts you can activate a release at the bottom and push a part of the box outward to reach places the lift might not be able to drive under.

It was when I was above that black statue, box extended, when I dropped one of my tools. A pair of cutters. It sailed through the air, all the way down and into a crack in the wooden frame around it.

I swore to myself as I carefully maneuvered the lift to a spot away from the collection. Then I rushed over to get my cutters while praying that I hadn’t damaged the statue.

Thankfully, it was untouched. The featureless face was as smooth and unsettling as when I first saw it. No chips on the arms or body. I crouched and peered through. I could see my cutters, just at the cusp of where I could reach. I noticed something else I hadn’t seen before. Chains. Around each leg, just above the ankle, were a thick metal ring attached to the base of the statue with iron chains. I supposed it was part of the piece, some kind of commentary on how man was shackled by…something. Like I said, I don’t really get all that art stuff.

I stuck my hand in, turning my head left as I tried to get as much length into my reach as I could. I felt the pair of cutters on the tips of my fingers. I grasped it. Then I heard the chains rattle.

I jerked my arm out and backed up a little. I let out a couple of breaths and calmed down. I must have brushed against the chain when I put my hand in, I thought. That would make sense. Even though I don’t remember feeling the cold steel on my wrist, or the weight of the metal against my arm, that must be what happened.

I stood up and decided it was time for my second break. It was already dark outside. My watch read 10:22 p.m. As I walked back to the break room, I could swear I felt invisible eyes staring at me the whole way back.

I filled up my third cup of coffee for the day and sat down. I was exhausted, this was the most work I’ve had to do all week. All those lights going out at once without there really being anything wrong with them. Whatever. I had tomorrow off, so as long as I got through today, I’ll be fine. That’s what I thought.

The fluorescent bulbs in the room began to flicker. I stopped drinking at set the mug down. Then all the appliances started emitting sparks. First the coffee machine, then the microwave, even the mini fridge. Its dull buzz silenced. I pushed my chair back to stand, but before I could stand all the lights in the break room shattered with a loud pop. I was enshrouded in darkness. Alone, I thought. Until I heard the footsteps.

Heavy. Slow. Measured. Like a predator closing in on its prey. The worst part was that the sound was coming from directly behind me.

I bolted out of the plastic folding chair and sprang forward, back into the warehouse. The lights I had spent all day fixing were still on, but all of them were flickering. I heard furniture scatter and chanced a glance through the break room window. I turned around just in time to see a large black fist crash through the glass. I put my right arm in front of my face as glass shards sprayed towards me. I felt their sharp edges leave shallow cuts across it. Then I spun on my heels and ran towards my cart.

I jammed the key into the ignition and tried to turn on the orange electric vehicle. It stalled once. It stalled twice. I could see a large dark figure approaching from the left. Finally, it sprang to life. I threw it in reverse just as the thing’s shadowy arm gripped onto the front of the cart. I broke free from its grasp, but I only made it about twenty yards before the engine cut out.

I looked up, back towards the creature. I couldn’t see it anymore, but I could still hear the footsteps. The warehouse lights were starting to fail, darkness swallowing the north end of the building I had just escaped from. I sat in horror, each step growing louder, another row of lights dying, the darkness inching closer. I caught a glimpse of a leg step into the dim light before disappearing under a new layer of black.

I swore and hopped out of the cart. I was near the art pieces we were storing. I looked straight down the middle, at the case that was supposed holding the eight-foot-tall ebony statue. It was gone.

The wooden frame was still intact. The chains I had seen earlier were lying on the base of it, still whole but no longer tethered. I felt my heart hammering as I ran, the veil of shadows consuming the warehouse. I didn’t know where to go. I didn’t think I could make it to the other exit before I was eaten by the darkness behind me.

The scissor lift.

I had left it near the art pieces. It should still be there. I prayed to God it still had a charge.

I sprinted with renewed strength and clambered up the ladder and into the lift. I pulled the red button to turn it on. Two out of the five battery lights were on. It would have to do.

I pushed the lever forward and the lift surged forward, slower than the cart would be but faster than if so tried to run. I could already feel myself running out of steam, all that time spent up in the hot ceiling had drained me.

The shadows chased me further down the warehouse. I could see the figure again. It was running now. It’s arms and legs popping out from the darkness as it continued to spread in his wake. I couldn’t see it, but I know its face would be blank. I wasn’t going to make it.

Desperate, I flipped the lifts controls, putting it out of drive and instead began it up into the air. I had reached the lifts full height by the time it reached me. I saw its form begin to climb before the darkness caught up to it, the lift shaking dangerously as I had no doubt it was ascending. I could just catch flashes of its approaching figure from the pale light of the moon.

The moon. I could see the light from the moon. The only source of illumination left in the warehouse. I looked behind and saw I was near a skylight, the full moon visible in the sky amongst the twinkling stars. I tried to push the lift forward, but it was dead. I let loose a cry of desperation and started to kick at the release for the extension. The box shook and I saw a hand grip the railing at the other end. I felt in my pocket for my phone. Under twenty percent, but it could buy me some time. I threw on the flashlight and turned it at the statue. It slowed its approach under the light of the phone. It slowly pulled itself up towards the box, its blank face radiating malice.

I spun back around and forced the release free, pushing the box outwards under the skylight just as the battery on my phone died. I dove towards the safety of the moonlight. I sat there on the shaking lift, and the statue stood there hunched, stopped at the cusp of the pale glow of the moon. I closed my eyes and pretended that I was going to be okay.

That’s where the moving crew found me a couple hours later. I don’t know when it slipped back into its cage, but the statue was back inside the wooden frame when they got there.

We all know that person. The one who seems to thrive on stirring the pot, pushing boundaries, and making waves wherever they go. Whether it's your colleague who constantly challenges every decision, your family member who brings drama to every gathering, or that team member who seems allergic to following protocols – these individuals can turn any peaceful environment into a stress zone.

But here's the thing: learning to work with these challenging personalities isn't just about survival – it's about mastering one of life's most valuable skills. Today, let's explore a comprehensive approach to managing these situations with grace, effectiveness, and your sanity intact.

## Understanding the Psychology Behind Boundary-Crossing Behavior 🧠

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to understand what drives people to consistently push limits and create friction. Most boundary-crossers aren't inherently malicious – they're often driven by deeper psychological needs:

**The Need for Control** 🎯
Some individuals feel secure only when they can influence or control their environment. When they can't predict outcomes, they create disturbances to regain a sense of agency.

**Attention-Seeking Behavior** 👀
For some, negative attention feels better than no attention at all. They've learned that creating conflict guarantees they won't be ignored.

**Fear of Irrelevance** 😰
Others cross boundaries because they fear being overlooked or undervalued. Disruption becomes their way of proving their importance.

**Unresolved Personal Issues** 💭
Sometimes, boundary-crossing behavior stems from personal frustrations, unmet needs, or past traumas that manifest as challenging behavior in group settings.

## The Foundation: Your Internal Response System 🛡️

The most crucial aspect of dealing with difficult individuals starts within yourself. Your internal response determines whether you become part of the problem or part of the solution.

**Emotional Regulation First** 🧘‍♀️
When someone consistently pushes your buttons, your natural instinct might be to push back. However, reactive responses typically escalate conflicts rather than resolve them. Develop a personal pause protocol:

- Take three deep breaths before responding
- Ask yourself: ""What outcome do I want here?""
- Choose your response based on effectiveness, not emotion

**Maintain Your Energy Boundaries** ⚡
Challenging individuals can be energy vampires, draining your enthusiasm and motivation. Protect your mental space by:
- Setting specific times for dealing with difficult conversations
- Creating physical or temporal boundaries when possible
- Practicing mental separation between their issues and your well-being

## The Strategic Response Framework 📋

Here's a practical methodology that works across all environments – whether you're dealing with family dynamics, office politics, or team management challenges.

### Phase 1: Assessment and Documentation 📊

**Identify Patterns** 🔍
Start by objectively documenting the specific behaviors that create problems. Avoid emotional language and focus on observable actions:
- What exactly do they do that crosses boundaries?
- When does this behavior typically occur?
- What triggers seem to activate these responses?
- How does their behavior affect group dynamics?

**Distinguish Between Intent and Impact** ⚖️
Sometimes people create problems without realizing it. Understanding whether the behavior is intentional or unconscious helps you choose the right approach.

### Phase 2: The Direct Conversation Method 💬

**Choose Your Timing** ⏰
Have the conversation when:
- You're emotionally calm and centered
- They're not in the middle of a particularly difficult episode
- You have adequate time for a full discussion
- The environment is private and non-threatening

**Use the Behavior-Impact-Request Formula** 📝
Structure your conversation using this proven approach:

1. **Behavior**: ""I've noticed that during team meetings, you tend to interrupt others while they're presenting their ideas.""

2. **Impact**: ""This makes it difficult for everyone to share their thoughts completely, and I've seen some team members become hesitant to contribute.""

3. **Request**: ""I'd appreciate it if you could let people finish their complete thoughts before adding your input. Your insights are valuable, and I want to make sure everyone's voice is heard.""

**Listen for Understanding** 👂
Give them space to explain their perspective. Often, boundary-crossers have legitimate concerns that are being expressed poorly. Understanding their underlying needs helps you find collaborative solutions.

### Phase 3: Boundary Setting and Consistency 🚧

**Establish Clear Expectations** 📏
Be specific about what behavior you need to see:
- ""In our family discussions, we wait for others to finish before speaking.""
- ""For project decisions, we follow the agreed-upon approval process.""
- ""When conflicts arise, we address them directly with the person involved rather than discussing them with others.""

**Follow Through Consistently** 🎯
The most important part of boundary setting is consistent enforcement. If you set a boundary but don't maintain it, you actually reinforce the problematic behavior.

## Advanced Strategies for Persistent Cases 🚀

### The Redirect Technique 🔄
When someone starts creating problems, redirect their energy toward constructive channels:
- ""I can see you have strong feelings about this. What specific solution would you propose?""
- ""Your concern seems important. Can you put together a brief proposal for how we might address it?""
- ""I appreciate your passion for this project. How can we channel that energy into helping the team succeed?""

### The Limited Engagement Approach ⏳
For chronic boundary-crossers who don't respond to direct conversation:
- Set specific time limits for discussions
- Use structured communication formats (like email) to avoid lengthy debates
- Create clear agendas for meetings to prevent derailment
- Implement decision-making protocols that prevent endless revisiting of settled issues

### The Natural Consequences Method 📈
Sometimes the best teacher is reality itself. Allow natural consequences to occur while protecting others from the fallout:
- If they consistently miss deadlines, don't cover for them
- If they create conflict, let them handle the relationship repair
- If they ignore protocols, let them experience the resulting inefficiencies

## Building Team Resilience 🤝

**Create Strong Group Norms** 📜
When dealing with a challenging individual in a team setting, strengthen the group's resilience by:
- Establishing clear communication guidelines that everyone agrees to follow
- Creating processes for conflict resolution that don't rely on avoiding the difficult person
- Building team bonds that can withstand individual disruptions

**Empower Others** 💪
Don't make yourself the sole manager of the difficult person. Train other team members or family members to respond appropriately:
- Share effective communication techniques
- Encourage others to set their own boundaries
- Create support systems for those most affected by the challenging behavior

## When Professional Help is Needed 🚨

Recognize when a situation requires external intervention:
- The behavior significantly impacts productivity or well-being
- There are signs of deeper psychological issues that need professional attention
- Safety concerns arise for any team members
- The person shows no awareness of their impact despite multiple conversations

## The Long-Term Perspective 🔮

Remember that changing human behavior is a marathon, not a sprint. Some individuals may never become easy to work with, but most people can learn to modify their approach when they:
- Understand the impact of their behavior
- Feel heard and respected in the process
- See clear benefits to changing their approach
- Experience consistent, fair consequences for boundary-crossing

## Daily Implementation Strategies 📅

**Morning Preparation** 🌅
Before entering environments where you'll interact with challenging individuals:
- Set your intention to remain calm and solution-focused
- Review your boundaries and commit to maintaining them
- Prepare specific responses for likely scenarios

**During Interactions** 🎭
- Stay focused on the current issue rather than bringing up past grievances
- Use neutral, professional language even when frustrated
- Look for opportunities to acknowledge positive contributions

**Evening Reflection** 🌙
- Review what worked well and what you'd handle differently
- Release any emotional residue from difficult interactions
- Plan improvements for future encounters

## Creating Positive Momentum ➕

**Catch Them Doing Something Right** ✨
When the challenging person behaves appropriately, acknowledge it immediately. Positive reinforcement is often more powerful than consequences for changing behavior.

**Focus on Progress, Not Perfection** 📈
Celebrate small improvements rather than waiting for complete transformation. This encourages continued growth and prevents you from becoming discouraged.

**Model the Behavior You Want to See** 🌟
Your consistent demonstration of respectful, professional behavior sets the standard and often influences others to match your approach.

## The Bigger Picture 🖼️

Dealing with challenging individuals isn't just about managing immediate problems – it's about developing skills that serve you throughout life. Every difficult person you learn to work with effectively makes you more capable of handling future challenges. You're building resilience, communication skills, and emotional intelligence that benefit every relationship in your life.

Moreover, remember that we all have moments when we're the challenging person in someone else's story. Approaching difficult individuals with empathy and practical strategies creates a more understanding, functional world for everyone.

The goal isn't to change people – it's to create conditions where everyone, including challenging individuals, can contribute their best while respecting the needs and boundaries of others. This approach leads to stronger teams, healthier families, and more satisfying relationships across all areas of life.

When you master these skills, you become someone others look to for leadership in difficult situations. You become the person who can maintain peace without avoiding necessary conflicts, who can be firm without being harsh, and who can create positive outcomes even in challenging circumstances.

Remember: every difficult person is an opportunity to practice and refine these essential life skills. Embrace the challenge, stay committed to growth, and watch as your increased capability transforms not just your relationships, but your entire experience of navigating the human experience. 🌈

1n4fra6,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n4fra6/breaking_the_cycle_a_practical_guide_to/,Breaking the Cycle: A Practical Guide to Supporting the Always-Struggling Team Member 🔄,"

Every workplace, family, and social circle has one: that person who seems perpetually caught in a storm of misfortune. They're the colleague who always has a crisis during deadlines, the family member whose problems dominate every gathering, or the friend whose conversations revolve around their latest catastrophe. While our natural instinct is to help, we often find ourselves exhausted, frustrated, and wondering why our efforts never seem to make a lasting difference.

## Understanding the Pattern 🧠

The individual who consistently presents themselves as overwhelmed by circumstances often operates from a deeply ingrained behavioral framework. This isn't about judging their character – it's about recognizing a pattern that can be addressed constructively.

These patterns typically include:
- Consistently attributing setbacks to external forces beyond their control
- Seeking immediate emotional relief rather than practical solutions
- Becoming defensive when offered constructive feedback
- Displaying resistance to taking ownership of outcomes
- Experiencing genuine distress while simultaneously avoiding responsibility

## The Hidden Cost of Enabling 💸

When we repeatedly rescue someone from the natural consequences of their choices, we inadvertently reinforce their belief that they are powerless. This creates a cycle where:

**For them:** Problems persist because root causes remain unaddressed. Self-confidence erodes as they become increasingly dependent on others for solutions.

**For you:** Energy depletes as your efforts yield temporary relief at best. Resentment builds when appreciation seems short-lived or absent entirely.

**For the team:** Productivity suffers as disproportionate time and resources get redirected. Team morale declines when some members consistently avoid accountability.

## A New Approach: The Support-Challenge Balance ⚖️

Instead of continuing the rescue cycle, consider implementing a methodology that promotes genuine growth while maintaining healthy boundaries.

### Phase 1: Establish Clear Expectations 📋

Begin every interaction by setting realistic parameters. When approached with a problem, respond with something like:

""I understand you're facing a challenge. I'm willing to spend 15 minutes brainstorming solutions with you, but I'll need you to come prepared with at least two ideas you've already considered.""

This immediately shifts the dynamic from complaint-focused to solution-oriented while establishing that your time has value.

### Phase 2: The Three-Question Framework ❓

Before offering any assistance, ask these three questions:

1. ""What specific steps have you already taken to address this?""
2. ""What would need to happen for you to handle similar situations independently in the future?""
3. ""How will you measure success in resolving this issue?""

These questions serve multiple purposes: they assess genuine effort, promote forward thinking, and create accountability metrics.

### Phase 3: Conditional Assistance 🎯

Make your support contingent on their active participation:

""I'm happy to help you research options, but only after you've completed the preliminary research we discussed.""

This ensures they remain invested in the solution rather than passively waiting for rescue.

## Practical Daily Strategies 🛠️

### In Professional Settings

**During meetings:** When they bring up problems without solutions, redirect with: ""That sounds challenging. What approaches are you considering, and how can the team support your chosen strategy?""

**For project delays:** Instead of extending deadlines automatically, ask: ""What resources or process changes would help you meet similar deadlines in the future?""

**During performance reviews:** Focus on specific behaviors and measurable outcomes rather than general personality traits.

### In Family Dynamics

**At family gatherings:** Limit problem-focused conversations to a set timeframe, then consciously shift to neutral topics.

**For financial requests:** Offer to help create a budget or find resources rather than providing direct financial assistance.

**During emotional outbursts:** Acknowledge their feelings while maintaining boundaries: ""I can see you're upset. When you're ready to discuss practical next steps, I'm here to listen.""

### In Personal Relationships

**Set communication schedules:** ""I'm available to discuss serious topics on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7-8 PM.""

**Practice the 24-hour rule:** When asked for immediate help, respond with: ""Let me think about this overnight and get back to you tomorrow.""

**Implement reciprocity:** Balance conversations by sharing your own challenges and expecting similar support in return.

## The Gradual Transition Method 🌱

Change doesn't happen overnight. Expect resistance and prepare for temporary increased drama as established patterns get disrupted. Here's how to navigate this transition:

### Week 1-2: Information Gathering
Observe and document patterns without intervening. Notice frequency of crises, types of problems, and their typical responses to different types of assistance.

### Week 3-4: Boundary Implementation
Begin using the three-question framework and conditional assistance approach. Expect pushback and maintain consistency.

### Week 5-8: Reinforcement Phase
Continue applying new strategies while acknowledging any positive changes, however small.

### Week 9-12: Evaluation Period
Assess whether the relationship dynamic has improved and adjust your approach accordingly.

## When to Escalate Concerns 🚨

Sometimes, persistent patterns indicate deeper issues requiring professional intervention. Consider suggesting professional resources when you observe:

- Complete inability to function independently in basic life areas
- Extreme emotional reactions that seem disproportionate to circumstances
- Patterns that significantly impact their health, safety, or livelihood
- Behaviors that create unsafe or disruptive environments for others

Present this suggestion factually: ""I've noticed these challenges are significantly impacting your daily life. A professional counselor might have specialized strategies that could be more helpful than what I can offer.""

## Protecting Your Own Well-being 🛡️

Supporting someone stuck in these patterns can be emotionally draining. Maintain your own stability by:

**Setting time limits:** Decide in advance how much time and energy you're willing to invest.

**Creating buffer zones:** Schedule downtime after interactions to process and recharge.

**Seeking peer support:** Discuss your strategies with trusted friends or mentors who can offer perspective.

**Monitoring your stress levels:** Notice if their problems begin affecting your sleep, mood, or other relationships.

## The Long-term Vision 🔮

The goal isn't to abandon someone in need but to help them develop genuine resilience and self-efficacy. When implemented consistently, this approach often leads to:

- Reduced frequency of crises as they develop better coping strategies
- Increased confidence as they experience success in problem-solving
- Improved relationships as interactions become more balanced
- Enhanced team productivity as everyone takes appropriate responsibility

## Common Obstacles and Solutions 🧗‍♂️

**""But they'll think I don't care anymore""**
Caring doesn't require sacrificing your boundaries. Healthy support looks different from enabling.

**""What if they really can't handle things alone?""**
Most people are more capable than they initially appear. Start with small challenges and gradually increase expectations.

**""Other people think I'm being too harsh""**
Others may not see the full pattern or understand the long-term benefits of your approach. Stay focused on what's working.

**""I feel guilty when I don't immediately help""**
Remember that immediate rescue often prevents genuine learning and growth.

## Measuring Progress 📈

Track improvement through concrete indicators:
- Longer intervals between crisis reports
- Increased quality of their proposed solutions
- More balanced conversation topics
- Reduced emotional intensity during problem discussions
- Evidence of independent problem-solving attempts

## Conclusion: Building Stronger Communities 🤝

Supporting someone who consistently struggles requires patience, strategy, and strong boundaries. By shifting from rescue mode to empowerment mode, we create opportunities for genuine growth while protecting our own well-being and maintaining healthier relationships.

The most compassionate thing we can do is help others discover their own capability and resilience. This approach benefits everyone: the individual develops real skills, relationships become more balanced, and communities become stronger and more sustainable.

Remember, change is a process, not an event. Stay consistent with your new approach, celebrate small improvements, and trust that investing in someone's long-term growth serves them better than temporary rescue efforts.

The strategies outlined here work because they address the root cause rather than just the symptoms. They require courage to implement and patience to see results, but they offer the best chance for creating lasting positive change in both individual lives and community dynamics.

Because what just happened absolutely blew my mind.

I just made $100 in a SINGLE WEEK.
From my PHONE.
By TESTING APPS.

No, this isn’t one of those “it’ll take 6 months” schemes. Literally SEVEN days.

And I just did it all by using this **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (I’m not gatekeeping — you NEED to see this for yourself).

Let me break it down, because, honestly, I’m still in SHOCK:

- Started out super skeptical. Like, what’s the catch?  
- Signed up through **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and expected junk, honestly.
- They had me test new apps and give simple feedback—sometimes it was just rating how fun it was or filling out a two-minute survey.
- The apps are all kinds—games, productivity, even shopping.

I wasn’t locked into anything either.
You just grab an app, follow a few steps, and you’re DONE.  
Some tests paid $5, others hit $15 (!)

HERE'S THE INSANE PART:  
I kept thinking, “There’s no way they’ll really pay out.”  
But after I hit the minimum, it actually sent me REAL MONEY — not points, not cryptic gift cards — actual cash.

I did the math after a week:

- Around an hour a day (sometimes just while waiting for my coffee).
- Total earned? $107 in SEVEN DAYS.
- That’s honestly pizza money, train fare, or a few new books (if you’re weird like me).

The link I used? **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
Sorry, but I’m reposting it again because I’m so WILDLY hyped.

Is this the “get-rich” hack the billionaires don’t want you to know about?  
No, probably not.  
But if you:
- Always have your phone around
- Like playing Games or being the first to beta test new features
- Hate being bored and unproductive

…It’s kind of a GLITCH in the system.

Before anyone jumps in: Yes, I double checked.  
NO shady stuff, NO selling your data, and you literally just click in, test, and collect.  
So far, no annoyances. If that changes, I’ll update!

Will $100 a week make me Elon Musk? No.  
Is it the best side hustle I’ve stumbled onto while sitting on my couch, eating snacks?  
ABSOLUTELY.

If you try it, PLEASE tell me how it goes. Or if you make more than me (prove it, you legend), drop your results.

Last link drop because I have to: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
But seriously, if you’re on Reddit scrolling, what’s stopping you from using that time to test an app and get a bit of easy cash?

Maybe I’ll see you on the leaderboard (or maybe not, because I want that top spot)!  
Let’s get this app money, team!

I wake before the sun again, sleep slips through my fingers like water, and I find myself in the living room, bathed in barely-there light.. The fish tank hums softly, casting slow waves of color across the walls-blue, then violet, red then green. I light a candle, not for ambiance, but almost as in remembrance. As if the flame could hold everything I've built, everything I've fought for.

I sit in silence and ask the question I've been avoiding:

*Am I really going to have to give all this up?*

This house-these walls-have heard children's laughter echo down the hallway. That yard out front? It was their kingdom. They ruled it with scraped knees and wild imaginations, like they owned the whole street. So many bruises, so many late nights. Nights like this one. I don't know if I'm ready to let go. Maybe I never will be.

The candle flickers, and I swear it dances in time with my thoughts. I remember the way my youngest used to sneak out of bed to sit beside me on nights like this. No words, just the comfort of presence. We'd watch the fish swim in lazy circles, pretending they had secrets to tell. I'd whisper stories to fill the silence- half truths, half magic- just to keep the weight of the world from settling on their small shoulders.

Now it's just me. And the silence feels heavier.

Bills pile up on the kitchen counter like unanswered questions. The mortgage is past due again. I’ve stretched every dollar until it’s transparent, but the numbers don’t care. They don’t bend for sentiment. They don’t see the crayon marks on the wall or the memories tucked into every corner. They just demand.

I’ve run the math a hundred times. Sold what I could. Cut back where it hurt. But the truth is, this house is slipping through my hands like sand. And I’m not sure if I’m mourning the loss of the home itself—or the life I thought I could keep inside it.

I trace the edge of the coffee table with my finger, remembering the dent from the toy car crash, the stain from the spilled juice that never quite came out. This place is a scrapbook of moments no else sees. And yet, the world outside keeps moving, indifferent to the sacredness of these walls.

I wonder if healing means leaving, or if it means staying and learning to breathe again.

*Understanding and managing difficult personalities in your daily interactions*

---

## The Challenge We All Face 🤔

We've all encountered them – those individuals who seem to believe the world revolves around them. Whether it's a colleague who takes credit for everyone's work, a family member who dominates every conversation, or a team member who can't handle criticism, these personality types can make our daily lives significantly more challenging.

The good news? There are proven strategies that work across all environments – from your living room to the boardroom, from school projects to community organizations. Let's explore practical approaches that anyone can implement, regardless of their background or beliefs.

---

## Recognizing the Patterns 🔍

Before diving into solutions, it's crucial to identify the behaviors we're dealing with. Self-centered individuals typically exhibit these characteristics:

**Communication Patterns:**
• Always steering conversations back to themselves
• Interrupting others frequently
• Dismissing others' opinions or experiences
• Taking credit for group achievements
• Rarely asking genuine questions about others

**Emotional Responses:**
• Extreme reactions to criticism or feedback
• Inability to acknowledge mistakes
• Blaming others when things go wrong
• Seeking constant validation and praise
• Getting defensive when questioned

**Relationship Dynamics:**
• Expecting special treatment
• Having difficulty maintaining long-term relationships
• Showing little genuine empathy for others' struggles
• Creating drama or conflict to gain attention
• Manipulating situations to their advantage

---

## The Foundation Strategy: Boundaries First 🛡️

The most effective approach starts with establishing clear, consistent boundaries. This isn't about being mean or confrontational – it's about protecting your own well-being and creating a framework for healthier interactions.

**Setting Personal Limits:**

Start by identifying what behaviors you will and won't tolerate. Write these down privately. Examples might include:
• Not allowing interruptions during your speaking time
• Refusing to engage in gossip or negative talk about others
• Not accepting blame for things you didn't do
• Limiting the amount of personal information you share

**Communicating Boundaries Clearly:**

When boundaries are crossed, address it immediately but calmly. Use specific, factual language:
""I need to finish my point before hearing your response.""
""Let's focus on solutions rather than who's at fault.""
""I'm not comfortable discussing this topic right now.""

The key is consistency. Boundaries only work when they're maintained every time, not just when it's convenient.

---

## The Art of Strategic Communication 💬

Interacting with self-centered individuals requires a different communication approach than you might use with others. Here are practical techniques that work:

**The Information Diet Method:**

Share only what's necessary for the task at hand. Self-centered individuals often use personal information as ammunition later or as opportunities to redirect conversations. Keep interactions focused and professional.

**The Redirect Technique:**

When conversations veer toward their personal drama or self-promotion, gently redirect:
""That's interesting. Now, about the project deadline...""
""I understand your perspective. Let's look at what needs to be done next.""

**The Documentation Approach:**

In professional settings, document important decisions and agreements via email or written notes. This prevents later claims of ""I never agreed to that"" or ""That wasn't my responsibility.""

**The Gray Rock Method:**

Sometimes, becoming temporarily boring and unresponsive is the most effective strategy. Give minimal responses, avoid emotional reactions, and don't provide the drama or attention they're seeking.

## Managing Different Environments 🏢🏠👥

**In Family Settings:**

Family dynamics are often the most challenging because you can't simply walk away. Here's what works:

Create physical and emotional space when possible. This might mean:
• Taking breaks during family gatherings
• Having prepared responses for predictable behaviors
• Focusing conversations on neutral topics
• Setting time limits for phone calls or visits

Remember, you don't have to attend every argument you're invited to. Sometimes the most powerful response is simply not responding.

**In Professional Environments:**

Workplace situations require more finesse due to hierarchy and professional relationships:

• Keep all communications professional and task-focused
• Use team meetings to your advantage by having witnesses to decisions
• When receiving credit-stealing behavior, calmly state facts: ""Actually, I developed that approach last Tuesday, as mentioned in my email.""
• Build relationships with other team members independently

**In Social or Community Groups:**

These settings often allow for more direct action:

• Speak privately with group leaders about disruptive behaviors
• Use group dynamics to your advantage by engaging with multiple people, not just the difficult individual
• Don't be afraid to limit your participation if the environment becomes too toxic

---

## The Power of Emotional Regulation 🧘‍♀️

Your emotional response is your greatest tool and potentially your biggest weakness. Self-centered individuals often thrive on creating emotional chaos. Here's how to maintain your equilibrium:

**Before Interactions:**

Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself of your goals for the interaction. What do you need to accomplish? Focus on that outcome rather than on changing the other person's behavior.

**During Difficult Moments:**

Use the pause technique. When you feel your emotions rising, pause before responding. Count to five, take a breath, then respond from a place of logic rather than emotion.

**After Challenging Encounters:**

Don't ruminate on the interaction. Instead, focus on what went well, what you learned, and what you might do differently next time. Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member for perspective.

---

## Building Your Support Network 🤝

Dealing with difficult personalities shouldn't be a solo effort. Build relationships with others who understand your situation:

**At Work:**
• Cultivate relationships with colleagues who share your values
• Find mentors who can provide guidance on navigation strategies
• Consider joining professional groups outside your immediate workplace

**In Personal Life:**
• Maintain friendships outside problematic family dynamics
• Join clubs or groups based on your interests
• Consider working with a counselor or coach for additional strategies

**Online Communities:**
• Connect with others facing similar challenges
• Share experiences and learn new approaches
• Remember that you're not alone in dealing with these situations

---

## The Long-Term Perspective 🔮

Remember that you cannot change other people's fundamental personality patterns. What you can change is how you respond to them and how much influence you allow them to have over your well-being.

**Realistic Expectations:**

Don't expect sudden transformations or genuine apologies. Instead, focus on:
• Minimizing the impact on your daily life
• Protecting your mental and emotional energy
• Maintaining your own integrity and values
• Building resilience for future challenging interactions

**Success Metrics:**

Measure your success not by whether the difficult person changes, but by:
• How quickly you recover from challenging interactions
• Your ability to maintain boundaries consistently
• The quality of your other relationships
• Your overall stress levels and life satisfaction

---

## Practical Daily Strategies 📅

**Morning Preparation:**
Start each day with a brief mental preparation if you know you'll be interacting with challenging individuals. Remind yourself of your boundaries and goals.

**During Interactions:**
Keep conversations brief and focused. Use phrases like ""I need to think about that"" to buy time before responding to difficult requests or statements.

**Evening Reflection:**
Spend a few minutes noting what worked well and what you might adjust for future interactions. This builds your skills over time.

**Weekly Review:**
Once a week, assess whether your strategies are working or if adjustments are needed. Consider whether you need additional support or resources.

---

## When to Seek Additional Help 🚨

Sometimes the situation may be beyond what you can handle alone. Consider seeking professional guidance when:

• The behavior escalates to abuse or threats
• Your physical or mental health is being affected
• You're considering major life changes (leaving a job, cutting family ties) due to the situation
• You feel completely overwhelmed and can't implement basic strategies

Professional counselors, mediators, or coaches can provide additional tools and perspective tailored to your specific situation.

---

## Moving Forward with Confidence 💪

The strategies outlined here aren't just theoretical – they're practical tools developed through real-world experience and research into human behavior patterns. The key is consistent application and patience with yourself as you develop these skills.

Remember that protecting your well-being isn't selfish; it's necessary. You can be compassionate toward difficult individuals while still maintaining healthy boundaries. You can be part of a team or family while refusing to be manipulated or mistreated.

Start small. Pick one or two strategies that resonate with you and practice them consistently. As you build confidence, you can expand your toolkit. Over time, you'll find that these challenging relationships have less power to disrupt your peace and productivity.

The goal isn't to become cold or unfeeling, but to become more strategic and intentional in how you engage with all the different personalities in your life. This approach will serve you well not just with self-centered individuals, but in all your relationships and interactions.

Your energy and attention are valuable resources. Invest them wisely, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise. You deserve relationships and environments that support your growth and well-being, and it's entirely within your power to create and maintain them.

I was STUNNED she was applying for a student exchange, I was just amazed by the way she spoke the way she looked how smart her answers were, then we all left. I didn't talk to her or say anything thinking it is just crush and to go away as always cuz I was healing from a messy very messy breakup so I wanted to look after myself deepen my connection with myself, the next couple of days were hell. I couldn't sleep, study or go anywhere without thinking about her, I don't have a type but I don't fall in love quickly. Neither do I go on dates.
But she was special.

I study ""virtual reality and mixed reality"" so there are 2 main parts to focus on ... The technical ""coding"" part and the visual ""artistic"" part
I've always loved art and i worked as an art teacher.

Next semester we shared the same class, ""2D animation ""so of course I showed how smart and much of an art nerd i am, i became friends with that professor and he allowed me to give classes on ""character designs and art 101"" along side him, as i help students who are more technical than artistic to pass this class, and the professor recommend me to other professors and of course that does help with future classes. She was impressed... Always had questions and curious, complimented me and my work, and was always listening to what i teach.

Same semester. I have the courage to go and talk to her after class. We've talked about art and how she always wants to be an artist but just ""couldn't"" we went for a coffee was her idea, I paid, and she got really shy, The next couple of days where heaven, I talked to her always in between classes we talked about mental health, gymnastics, sports in general, life, work as we both had jobs.. Etc etc.
At the end of the semester we've talked in total of 12 days as me and her don't attend classes very often lol anyways.
 It was summer break, we've talked over on Instagram. We didn't meet up since I had work and she did too 

Next semester, fellow classmates started realizing that there were something between me and her, so of course the rumors spread tabt we were in a relationship. I've never talked to a girl in uni and that was a huge green flag to a lot A LOT of girls there, so i was always a treasure as ny friend's ex gf always told him, i hate to brag but i do love the achievements that i have "" professional wrestler, art teacher, went on multiple events sharing my artworks and got very popular from them that i started selling prints at charity events and exhibitions"" which was unique especially in my country since I am from country that has a very noticeable unemployment rate and art careers especially are very hard to nail and earn from them.

Whenever I talk to her someone had to interrupt 
It was constant by some of guys that I know in my semester and some of her friends too. 
So I thought Instagram was the best option to talk. I hate texting but it's the only thing that I have in hand.
The first time i sent her a message 6th of June she replied in the 8th of July... We haven't seen each other in uni anymore IDK why, sometimes I don't show up the other times she doesn't...

Next semester which was my ""before the last"" semester
She didn't show up. We didn't have any classes in common. I didn't know what her her classes and I had very hard and strict schedule as I wanted to graduate early. 
I texted five times spread it across a month and a half. She replied after the last text and 6 days, The way she replies I could tell from her text that she is happy to talk to me like it was never "" Hi how are you? I'm fine you?"" No, we actually go into details about everything that happened since we last talked she says a lot about her days and about her mental well-being. Well I talk about my work and give her advice on her mentality as she struggles with social media in general.
She disappeared and deactivated her Instagram I sent her a message on WhatsApp cuz I was worried like I texted her and she just deactivated her Instagram. She did not reply for about 2 months which was the end of the semester 
That was on 21st of May 
I caught her that she went back to Instagram so I texted her worried about her. She replied in the same second saying how she was mentally. Not doing well how social media was a huge struggle for her, which of course is to a lot of people. So I told her some word of advice that whenever you need talk to someone I'm here. I'll always be stay focused on your work okay and your mental well-being as these two are the only thing that will help you. 
We talked about my birthday and her well-being that was on 31st of July 
The next day I sent her a message and didn't have a reply 
I decided to take off from Instagram to at this time for good. So I told her that: ""you can pick the day and time for us to hang out and talk about everything that happened between us cuz I don't know where it all went wrong. I do care about you and I care very much about your well-being. You can tell me whenever you're ready on WhatsApp""
When I was thinking my friends the story, a lot of them said that if someone truly care about another a 5-minute text saying I'm fine. I'm busy. It's not that hard to do.
Today was her graduation project 2 
She has a team of 2 men, her and another girl 
Those 2 guys are some of my dearest friends, they invented me to an after graduation party that happens immediately after the graduates exit uni's gates.

She was supposed to be at uni discussing with the professor's panel the team project. But when i looked at the gate 
The 3 members if the team got out... She were no where seen.
As the music blasted... I couldn't hold back my tears... My BFF noticed 
Said it was allergies from the smoke sticks they had on fire, and dressed me to the car I held back tears went back to the party. Enjoyed it said my goodbyes. That was the last chance I could have ever saw her again 
Today 31st of August she yet hasn't  replied to my last message.

Well, to my delight, there was a drink shop down the road that sold tea, coffee, and shakes, all protein based. It’s next to the gym, so initially, this made sense to me. Like, you’d think this was a pretty creative idea, right? A good way to draw in business. So I tried it, and admittedly I loved it. With time, I wondered more and more what their products were made from that they actually tasted decent while still having a protein base. Usually protein has a specific taste to it, you know? Well, today I found out. When I went in to get my morning coffee, I saw the bag of their product. 

HERBALIFE. 

I am appalled. It’s been months I’ve been putting who knows what in my body thinking happily that I had found a nutritious option for a treat. I now refuse to go back or give them any more business. It’s so sad and disappointing to want to support a small business only for it to turn back around and be a scam.

i *love* getting things that i, at first, think are useless only later to find they're actually amazing. another perfect example would be a rice cooker. i got one when i first went off to university and was like 'meh' because i didn't really eat rice at the time. a couple of years later, living with roommates, we were going through stuff in the kitchen and i was like 'maybe i'll use it after all' and omg i miss that rice cooker so much. you can do *anything* in a rice cooker.

the opposite is something you'd really like to keep using but just can't because there are constant issues. the best example i have is actually another stanley product that i really wanted to love but if you had one too, i'm sure you'd agree it's sort of a pain in the ass to clean. also, no matter how well i rinse it, it seems to always make my coffee taste like soap. i think whatever mechanisms are up at the top are too much.

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: Growth, Opportunity, and Regulatory Shifts\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, modern office building., the kingdom’s non-oil GDP is projected to expand by 5.8%, fueled by robust FDI, fintech innovation, and a service-sector boom. The 2024 Forbes Business ranking listed Bahrain among the top Gulf destinations for startups, right behind Dubai but with a notably lighter regulatory burden.\
Government reforms—especially MOICT’s digital transformation—mean Sijilat and EDB processes are faster than ever. The introduction of the 2025 Centralized KYC Directive (effective January 1, 2025) now requires all commercial banks to sync with the national eKYC gateway. This update streamlines onboarding for new companies, but also tightens initial documentation checks.\
Bahrain’s business hubs—Seef District’s corporate towers, Bahrain Bay’s waterfront offices, and the bustling Diplomatic Area—offer a dynamic ecosystem for entrepreneurs. Yet, every success story here is entwined with practical realities: paperwork, timing, and the nuances of local customs, from Ramadan work hours to majlis-style negotiation etiquette.\
Visit Bahrain.com for official business regulations and updates, and see this Gulf News business summary for the latest on Bahrain’s pro-business reforms.\
The Core Banking Question: Is Pre-Registration Bank Account Opening Possible?\
The Short, Honest Answer\
No, you cannot open a full corporate bank account in Bahrain before your company’s Commercial Registration (CR) is complete.\
Banks in Bahrain uniformly require your company’s CR, along with the signed Memorandum and Articles of Association (MOA), board resolution, and proof of address, before opening an operational business account.\
However, there are important exceptions and workarounds for entrepreneurs needing to move quickly:\
\
Initial Application File: Some local and international banks (like BBK, Al Salam Bank, and occasionally HSBC) allow you to pre-file your application, completing initial KYC steps while your CR is pending. Your account won’t be “active” until CR approval, but everything’s ready for immediate activation.\
Client Money Account: Certain legal and consulting firms can help open a special “in escrow” client account, typically reserved for deposit of initial capital or license fees, pending full company registration. This is not a standard operating account, and fees/legal oversight are required.\
Free Zone Companies: If you’re establishing a company in Bahrain’s free zones, some zones offer interim accounts and payment facilitation tools via their own administrative offices—but only for zone-related payments.\
Personal Account Use: A common but risky workaround is to use a founder’s personal account for seed expenses. Caution: local banks watch for business-like transactions in personal accounts and may freeze funds pending compliance checks.\
\
\
Personally, I once lost two weeks waiting for the CR to be issued, only to realize (too late) that pre-filing my bank paperwork could have saved me three crucial working days. (And yes, this happened the week before Ramadan, when banking hours shifted unpredictably.)\
\
Bahrain’s Business Structures: Which Type Impacts Banking Access Most?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, business meeting..\
Key Business Structures for Company Formation\
\
Single Person Company (SPC) – Fastest route for solo founders. Easier banking but subject to strict KYC.\
With Limited Liability (WLL) – Most common for SMEs and startups. Requires MOA, board resolution, and proof of shareholders.\
Bahrain Shareholding Company (BSC) – Larger ventures & regional branches. Complex but more credibility with international banks.\
Foreign Company Branch – Requires authorization from parent company, legalized documents, and increasingly, proof of 99%+ foreign ownership.\
\
Read this deep dive on Bahrain business type structures for a full comparison.\
Expert Tip: For startups with few shareholders, choose an SPC or WLL when speed is key—they’re quickest to register and easier for most banks to process.\
Ownership & Sponsorship\
Since the 2024 liberalization (per Reuters, Dec 2024), almost all sectors now allow for 99-100% foreign ownership, particularly in tech, consulting, and logistics. This means no local sponsor is required for most activities, slashing setup time and banking complications.\
Still, certain industries (some medical, defense, and oil services) may require a Bahraini partner—Keylink’s local sponsorship guide has the latest on exceptions.\
Step-by-Step Guide: Opening Your Bahrain Company and Bank Account\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, business documents. portal\
* Choose entity type (SPC, WLL, BSC, branch)\
* Reserve trade name (do this before Friday mornings to avoid Monday traffic on the site)\
* Upload MOA, passports, proof of address\
* Pay initial government fees (expect BHD 100–250 for standard SMEs)\
Visit this Keylink Bahrain company formation process guide for a granular breakdown.\
Shortcut: Batch scan and certify all documents at Seef District’s Al-Moayed Tower business center—a tip that once saved me half a day versus using the government customer service hubs.\
Step 2: Obtain Commercial Registration (CR) Certificate\
\
Await MOICT and EDB review (2–5 working days for most activities)\
Respond promptly to any clarifications; build a strong relationship with your case officer (Invite them for coffee—seriously, it matters here.)\
Receive digital CR by email and Sijilat portal\
\
Timing Hack: Monday mornings and post-Ramadan afternoons see the fastest response times, as staff are fresher and queues shorter.\
Step 3: Pre-File Bank Application\
\
Visit your preferred bank’s corporate services counter before 10:30 AM (Bahrain Financial Harbour branch for BBK is the smoothest—less retail traffic.)\
Submit all company documents, including pending CR receipt; specify you need “pre-approval pending CR.”\
Bring additional ID (CPR, passport), KYC forms, and proof of office lease.\
\
Warning: Do not wait until after the CR arrives. Pre-filing can shave 2–4 working days off typical bank onboarding.\
Step 4: Activate Account After CR Issue\
\
Forward your official CR and any final approvals to the bank\
Complete final signatures and, if needed, physical in-branch authentication (bring a Bahraini colleague if you want local networking cred—trust me, it helps)\
Receive IBAN and checkbook within 1–5 business days\
\
Step 5: Register with LMRA, Tamkeen, and Other Authorities\
\
LMRA (for visa sponsorship if hiring staff)\
Tamkeen (for grants and startup support)\
Municipal license (location-dependent; Bahrain Bay’s EDB office was the fastest for me)\
\
Insider Banking Tips to Save Time and Money\
Nobody tells you this: Bahrain banks often conduct informal reference checks, especially with foreign founders. A strong LinkedIn profile, and even a letter of recommendation from your accountant or law firm, can accelerate your application.\
\
Best Office Locations: Seef District and Diplomatic Area branches process corporate customers faster than mall-based locations.\
Document Shortcuts: Pre-certify copies at any Seef notary public; they accept digital scans with QR verification since 2025.\
Avoiding Queues: Ramadan mornings or Tuesday–Thursday before noon are quietest.\

Cost Considerations: What’s the Real Budget for Banking and Company Formation in Bahrain?\

|-------------------------------------- |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\
| Company Registration (Standard SME)  | 150–350            | Sijilat + MOICT fees; see complete breakdown     |\
| CR Certificate                       | Included           | Part of registration fee                          |\
| Bank Pre-Filing/Admin Fee             | 0–100              | Some banks waive if recommended by local partner   |\
| Minimum Bank Deposit                  | 100–1,000+         | Varies by bank/product type                       |\
| Legal/Consulting Support              | 200–1,000          | Optional but recommended for smooth compliance     |\
| Accounting & Bookkeeping             | 60–250/month       | Local support options here        |\
| Office Lease (Virtual/Physical)       | 40–800/month       | Diplomatic Area = premium; Seef = mid-range       |\
Surprisingly, opting for Bahrain Bay’s “business lounge” coworking solution costs less and gets you municipal approval faster than a traditional Seef District office lease.\

Compliance and Documentation: Cutting Through Bureaucracy\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, legal documents audit.\
* Shareholder passports/CPRs\
* Proof of address (office lease + utility bill)\
* Board resolution for account opening\
* Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) declaration (mandatory per 2025 update)\
* Tax registration certificate (if VAT-registered)\
Common Mistake: Many founders forget the recent requirement for a certified UBO form. I watched a startup colleague wait three extra business days for bank activation—always check the latest MOICT guidance.\
For post-registration services, Keylink’s accounting and compliance team is top-tier—I rely on them both for KYC refreshes and VAT returns.\
Professional Support: When to Call in the Experts\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, professional consultation. means local advisors are usually a wise investment.\
\
Keylink’s business advisors know the unspoken protocols—when to follow up, which bank managers to call, and how to pre-empt compliance holdups.\
A reliable accountant ensures you meet ongoing regulatory deadlines, sparing you costly late fees or tax penalties.\
Legal counsel is particularly valuable for branch office or regulated sector applications.\
\
And if you’re thinking, “I’ll just do it all myself”—remember, even one overlooked document can add weeks, and that’s the hidden cost few business guides mention.\
\
One tangent: Did you know that during Ramadan, coffee service in majlis-style meetings is both hospitality and a subtle negotiation cue? Accept a second cup, and your local partner knows you’re ready to sign—refusing signals you need more time. That’s the kind of cultural nuance that smooths otherwise bureaucratic encounters.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE and Saudi Arabia: Local Advantages\
Bahrain offers faster company setup and banking than UAE (where documentation is often more extensive) and considerably more flexibility than Saudi Arabia’s labor-intensive procedures. Bahrain’s recent 99% foreign ownership policy particularly benefits tech and consultancy founders.\
\
Importantly, Bahrain’s bank staff are more accessible and generally more “entrepreneur friendly” in person—a networking coffee in Seef goes further than three online forms in other GCC states.\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: Centralized eKYC & UBO Declarations\
The 2025 Centralized eKYC Directive requires all banks to onboard companies through the national KYC gateway, reducing paperwork but making UBO declaration and digital verification mandatory (implemented from January 2025). Adapting your document preparation (pre-scan, notarize in advance) will save a lot of back-and-forth with both MOICT and your bank.\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation and Banking\
1. Can I use my personal bank account for early stage company expenses in Bahrain?\
Using personal accounts for company transactions is risky and increasingly flagged by Bahraini banks. Accounts may be frozen for suspected business use. Always wait for your company’s CR and corporate account, or use a client escrow account if absolutely necessary.\
2. How long does it take to open a corporate bank account after company registration?\
With pre-filed paperwork and digital eKYC, you can activate a corporate account in 1–5 business days. Delays occur if any document is missing or UBO checks are incomplete. Find detailed process guidance at Bahrain company formation process.\
3. What are the real costs of company formation in Bahrain?\
Budget BHD 400–1,500 for registration, compliance, and bank account setup. See Keylink’s cost guide for a full fee breakdown by entity type.\
4. Is 100% foreign ownership possible in Bahrain?\
Yes, for almost all activities. Read about eligible sectors at foreigner-friendly activities and 99% ownership policy.\
5. Where can I find ongoing support for accounting, tax, or regulatory compliance?\
Keylink’s accounting and bookkeeping services offer ongoing compliance and reporting solutions, ensuring your company stays in good standing with MOICT, LMRA, and the tax authorities.\
\
Banking and company formation in Bahrain is never just about ticking boxes. It’s about timing, relationships, and a deep respect for both local law and the subtleties of Bahraini business culture. Prepare early, build strong local relationships, and use every shortcut you can—especially if you want to be the next success story rising above Bahrain Bay.\

1n4fffh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n4fffh/budget_espresso_alternatives_100/,Budget Espresso Alternatives? [$100].,"Hey everyone,

I'm a college student who wants to make iced lattes or other espresso drinks without spending a ton of money on a full espresso machine or buying from a café every day. I've been considering the AeroPress or OXO Rapid Brewer to make a strong concentrate, but I'm unsure if that's the best approach. I normally only make around 1 to 2 double espressos per day.

* Has anyone had experience using a coffee maker like the AeroPress?
* If so, can I use pre-ground coffee, or would I need to buy a grinder (if I need a grinder, any cheap manual or electric recommendations, I was looking at the OXO grinders)?
* Is there a better solution I'm not considering (for example, a Moka pot, manual espresso makers, etc.)?

I'm looking to spend no more than $100, and I live in the US. Thank you!",2,1756595618.0,espresso,16,1.0,False

I feel so much gratitude towards the members here!  After 13 years, Me and hubby got married last night and it was more than perfect.  Everything that could have gone wrong did the day before, the ceremony and reception went seamlessly and the only favors that did not get taken were  5 out of our 80 guests. 4 were sick and one got injured so absolutely understandable! It was our absolute  ""luxury "" dream wedding, the food was amazing , the staff of the event center super attentive and upbeat. The music was great, the flowers impeccable. Many guests told me how wonderful their mugs and favors were!  (Tea, coffee and a biscoff)

We had brunch with the out of town family this morning, packed up the event and put everything away.  It's 7pm I have  cocktail in hand and we are watching Peacemaker and planning for our  beach Honeymoon next week because traveling on a holiday is crazy chaos! 

Our  hearts so full of love and happiness. I shared a little sneak peek my absolute incredible photographer shared with us.

I was in Starbucks waiting for my coffee. It was busy, morning rush, and the staff were clearly slammed. The barista at the register couldn’t have been older than 19, you could tell she was new and a little nervous.

This guy in a suit, maybe late 40s, comes up and starts ordering like he’s Gordon Ramsay on a meltdown. Complicated order, snapping his fingers, sighing loudly when she asked him to repeat something. She got one part wrong on the screen and tried to fix it, but he suddenly goes off.

He starts raising his voice, saying stuff like “How hard is your job? It’s literally pressing buttons” and “If you can’t handle this maybe you shouldn’t even be working here.” The poor girl was shaking, her face went bright red. Everyone in line went dead silent.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I said, “Dude, she’s trying her best. It’s coffee, not open-heart surgery. Chill out.” He turns to me and snaps, “Mind your business.” I said, “It is my business when you’re acting like a bully in public.”

He glared at me, grabbed his coffee when it came, and stormed out muttering that people are “too sensitive.” The barista actually mouthed a “thank you” to me, but I noticed a couple of people in line looking at me like I was making it worse.

Now I’m wondering if I should’ve just stayed quiet instead of stepping in. Like, maybe I escalated things? But at the same time, watching a grown man scream at a teenager over a frappuccino felt insane.

You check your reflection, your cheek is red and a little puffy. One of mom’s rings must have scratched you. Deep enough to break the skin, but not enough to really bleed. It aches when you push on it.

At work, the fluorescents are cruel. Your face throbs like a beacon. Carl’s brow furrows and he tuts, lifting your chin.

“We got shovels if you need me to start digging,” he says.

Rhoda hangs her coat and leans on her cane, voice sharp.

“You want me to help you cover that up, or you wanna let it speak for itself?”

She pats your shoulder roughly, like she already knows which way you’ll go.

The shift crawls. Every customer is a spotlight, every glance a reminder. One guest snaps, you’re taking too long. Your hand jerks, tears burn your eyes.

Beth: “Maybe go take a breather, I can finish this up.”

“I’m fine,” you spit, throwing the hanger you were holding to the floor.

Rhoda’s already up, moving in and taking the other till.

Carl sends you for an “extended” coffee break. You’re not used to this, people throwing kindness at you. It almost hurts worse than your mom’s hand across your face.

You shake a cigarette out of the pack, just rolling it between your fingers. Your breath is still a little shaky when you light it.

Beth meanders out not long after, cigarette already dangling from her lip. 

“So… whose handiwork is that?”

“My mom,” you mutter, eyes on the ground. Cigarette butts are crushed into concrete, little halos of ash around them.

Beth hums absently, looking at you like, ‘go on’.

So, you tell her. You lean against the stucco wall and talk about your dad, your mom’s indifference, Larry’s gross hugs and weird Van Halen brags. The way she brushed you off when you told her the first time. ‘Why’d he go after a kid when he has me?’ Fragmented, bitter, fast. No neat story. Just enough. 

“And she chose Bakersfield, of all places, to ‘start over’. Like swapping skylines was supposed to fix anything. Same shit, just hotter pavement.”

Beth nods, blowing smoke out of her nose. 

“Yeah. People always want a do-over. Never wanna own anything.”

Beth drags on her smoke, eyes on the alley now. 

“My dad caught me kissing a girl when I was 16. Told me not to come back.”

Another drag. The smoke is heavier than her words, like she’s letting it carry the weight.
“David and Carl made sure I didn’t starve. That’s how I wound up here.”

You chew on that, not sure if you’re supposed to say something. Doesn’t matter—she’s already decided.

“Guess what I’m saying is… sometimes the people who are supposed to care don’t. And sometimes the ones who shouldn’t give a shit? They do.”

A beat, then, “Like I said, you can crash on my couch,” she says, “If you don’t mind the cats.”

You finish your shift in the back, processing donations. When you get outside, Jon’s parked, waiting. 

He pulls you into a hug and rests his chin on your head.

“I wish I could say the other guy looks worse,” you say, tucking your face against his neck. 

“Let’s get out of here,” he replies.

Jon takes you back to the drive-in. You catch him looking at your cheek in the rearview but he doesn’t say anything. His jaw flexes like he’s chewing on something he won’t say.

You both stretch across the hood, the metal still warm from the day. The blank screen looms, pockmarked with missing panels. Jon points them out, guiding your hand with his, making constellations from the gaps. You slide closer to him and his arm goes around you, warm and solid.

You talk Kobb, shows coming up, riffs he’s been wrestling with. He hums a half-finished melody into the air, tapping the beat against his thigh. You tell him about Des Moines, only the scraps worth keeping. He listens, smiling faint. His eyes still flick back to your cheek, quick and guilty, like a bad secret he isn’t sure he’s allowed to acknowledge.

The bugs come out, and he finally cuts the moment short with a decisive little finger-drum on the hood, like a cue only he hears.

The drive back is quiet, radio low. You ride past landmarks that are becoming your own. Quiet. Unremarkable.

The porch light is on but it doesn’t invite. You can see her through the window. She’s vanished into her own world: silent, eyes elsewhere, hands busy. You’re still half-scared to disappoint her like some kicked dog. Your hand falters on the knob, then you turn around. 

In Jon’s kitchen, David notices your cheek immediately.

“Whoa… what the hell happened?” His glare shoots straight at Jon.

“Relax,” you snap. “It’s nothing.”

“Doesn’t look like nothing.” David’s voice has an edge.

You scoff, “If Jon slapped me, I wouldn’t be here.”

The words land hard, but you know where you’ll end up later. Porch light on. Mom’s world waiting.Still half-scared to disappoint her like some kicked dog.

Jon yanks a cupboard open, glassware clinking as he grabs two glasses.

David leans back, hands up like ‘my bad’.

The edge bleeds off the room. David’s chair creaks as he pushes away from the table, heading downstairs. Jon sighs and opens the fridge. From his kitchen window you can see the apple tree in your own backyard. The hammock moves on its own, slow in the breeze.",1,1756595460.0,u_ScenicAbattoir,0,1.0,False

The woman, Patricia Anne Walker, stood across the street from the modest two bedroom flat with its window shutters and curtains open, watching the man sitting on the reclining chair in the living room. He was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers, he had black hair, blue eyes, was unshaven, light skinned, and he was drinking from a coffee mug, his expression thoughtful and contemplative. Leon. Her ex-boyfriend. He had caught her with another man. Not in bed, no. He had caught her kissing another man in the park. He confronted her than and there. Patricia had coldly laid down the facts as she saw them: He didn't make enough money to satisfy her, he was lousy in bed, and she didn't like his friends.

Leon's gaze turned from hurt to an icy glare at that last point of reasoning. ""I want you out of my flat by the end of this week.""

""Fine. I was planning on leaving anyways."" She said coldly. That night, she packed all of her things and moved out in two days. And then moved into her side guy's place.

For a while, everything was great: He lavished her with expensive gifts, expensive vacations, brand name clothes. But then, after a few years, he left her for another woman. He had just pack her bags while she was out one day and changed the locks. She had tried to get inside...only for him to open the door with another woman on his arm. ""We're done."" He said. Patricia had to suck up her pride and had begged her parents to move back into their home. And here she was, in front of her ex-boyfriend's home, hoping in vain that he'll allow her back into his life.

Patricia made a step forward...and then stopped. Someone had turned on some music. She saw Leon turn his head, presumably to the person who had started the music, and smiled so wide and openly that he looked like he'd split his face in two. A woman stepped into view. Patricia was able to place her immediately: It was Leon's friend Diane. She didn't like Diane. Diane was far more attractive than her, for one. Diane was also openly bisexual, another negative in Patricia's view. She could see that Diane was wearing a camisole top and panties that were so lacy they were practically see-through. And then, a third person stepped into view. A man wearing nothing but boxers. The man was black, had kinky hair, eyes as black as ebony, the pores in his skin practically invisible.

Patricia watched in utter disbelief as the three of them began to dance together. She watched as Diane kissed Leon and then the other man. But then, she saw something that made her want to vomit: Leon and the other man kissed. It was as soft and tender as when Leon and Diane had kissed.

She watched as they danced and laughed like loons, seemingly unaware of her presence. She turned and walked away, tears streaming down her face. Patricia felt like her whole world had just crumbled apart. And it was all her fault.

1n4fbpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/1n4fbpk/i_wish_they_adapt_the_last_three_books_in/,I wish they adapt the last three books in anime/animation style instead of live action,"I am on book 9 now and I started well after I had finished the series.
The Expanse TV show is probably in my list of best Tv series ever but once I read through the books it kind of makes the whole TV show pretty average.

I won’t discuss any specific spoilers here and don’t take me wrong, the expanse show is really peak TV fiction.

But it’s impossible to do these books justice with the budget you have for a Tv show. Even a big budget production house would not be able to justify the cost it would take to make the feel exactly like the books.

Is the last three books were done as live action it would simply not be justice to the books unless we are getting 3 blockbuster movies out of these.

But as the games have shown, animation gives a lot of creative freedom.

Small things like magnetic boots. They do not simulate gravity. They are just gluing a shirtless body. 

Or what does really drinking a coffee out of a bulb mean. Coffee is much less important in the TV show and I feel that takes away something. 

Actually the whole thing about low gravity eating. Sure nothing to do with the plot but it’s kind of like that invisible mana which makes the book so much better.

I am probably not getting my point across but think of Scavengers Reign animation. It got cancelled but I would ask everyone here whether belter or earther or Martian or ….  to go watch it.

And then imagine as a big budget Hollywood movie. Probably an avataresque budget will make it work, and even then I am not sure!

If not for the support, education, shared links and experiences of these groups, I may have just resigned myself to misery.

In this group, I just read a post called ""WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL US"". The message there, and the responses it received, made me want to finally share my own story:

Me: 48yo AFAB, AuDHD, enby, pan, married mother of two ND teens and one goofy dog. Dealing with peri symptoms for almost two years. Living on the obscenely expensive US west coast, with Kaiser insurance coverage. Natural ginger with the MC1R variant responsible for anesthetic resistance. Migraine sufferer, with excema, hypermobility, and undiagnosed (but likely) EDS. Verified supertaster. Chicken lady. Just happy to be here.

When I finally decided to consider HRT, I (47F at the time) had to educate my own mother (74 F in post) about modern HRT and the updated/corrected findings. No one talked about menopause when I was growing up,  and the only thing my mom told me in my late 30s was that same ""lose weight now"" thing so many of us have heard from our elders struggling through menopause. She initailly tried to talk me out of HRT, saying all the, same outdated stuff I'm sure you've heard, including that it could cause breast and uterine cancer, LOSS of bone density ❓️, and it just wasn't worth the risk. She said I should stop drinking coffee (I'm lucky if I finish one 8oz cup a day as it is) because that was what eventually helped her hot flashes. ""Eventually"" like after 10 years of menopause.

Over the last two years, multiple GPs and GYNOs told me there was no reliable test for hormones (other than thyroid, which was only the most basic TSH test, and always ""normal""). They wouldn't even discuss HRT with me because I was still having ""mostly regular"" periods, and said we couldn't consider it until 12 months after I stopped menstruating. 

Fatigue, stubborn weight gain, loss of muscle mass, awful brain fog, crazy sleep patterns, constant low level nausea and awful reflux, worsening of my migraines I've had since 13yo, joint pain, PMS symptoms I hadn't experienced since I was a teenager, and SO MUCH SWEATING. Sweating at night, sweating randomly standing in the aisle at the grocery store, sweating in the morning sitting up in bed talking to my partner, to the point that I'd have to tuck the sheet up under my pits to keep it from running into the bed and then put the sheets in the wash. And STILL, no help. No referral. Not even advice from these doctors. Just standard annual blood tests and a ""you're normal"" diagnosis.

I felt like giving up. Maybe I'd have to go out of network and spend out of pocket? Then I found these Reddit groups, read your stories and struggles and triumphs, and I finally had what I needed to keep going. Thank the meno-gods I finally found (almost an hour away from my local Kaiser facilities) a NP in the Kaiser network who listened. She asked a couple health history questions, looked at my record, took vitals, and immediately said ""I don't understand why they're resistant to starting HRT in peri. It can be so beneficial, and often more beneficial than starting it later. I'm happy to get you started on this."" ❤️😭❤️ 
I had my prescription filled and started that same day.

On week four now, of just the lowest dose of weekly transdermal Estradiol patches, 100mg oral micronized progesterone at night, and twice weekly Estradiol topical cream for my nethers. While the change isn't drastic, it's a vast improvement. Still have to get off my butt and start moving again now that I'm not tired all day long (just out of shape),  but the scale is starting to move in the right direction, my brain is starting to work again, and all the rest of the symptoms are more or less back to the way they were 5-10 years ago. Hasn't improved my dry and saggy skin, but hey, I'm not expecting full on miracles 😅

Should I drive? 13 hours isn’t short. I’ve heard the coast is a nice drive, but do I need 13 hours of it? Is it better to fly? I’ve heard parking is a pain and have to pay every night, but also not sure if ubering everywhere would be better

Should I go in sept or oct? When is prettier?

Should I stay in Portland or is it better in another city?

Looking to mainly do some nature sightseeing, some light hiking or nice walks, and want to try some good food spots and coffee places, where should I go. What would be the hot spot for this?

Help me make full use of my Costco membership and avoid disappointment from the checkout staff with my half empty cart. Hotdog and pizza on me.. and let’s also have ice cream to help beat the summer heatwave 🥵

I’m a secret rebel currently masquerading as a VP in tech aka corpo drone, constantly trying to get back at loblaws while figuring out how to get around this city with construction galore. Proud owner of a number of cozy sweaters (aka free human furnace), minor Coke Zero addict and a bit of lingering abandonment issues (working on it), major pizza fanatic - hoping to find a smart, funny, physically active partner who wants company for her dog walks and I dunno… nonchalantly fall for each other I guess. As an added bonus, we can finally become real adults and be each others emergency contacts.

Currently busy growing a mini jungle at home, adding to my Spotify playlist each week, already looking forward getting excited like a kid again with next years hockey season (damn you leafs 😭), playing random rec sports (floor hockey, beach volleyball etc) each week to stay active and sneaking in standup comedy/concerts (join me!) as much as possible. Always down for some fun travel adventures (India, Greece, Jamaica and all over parts of US so far this year), enjoying coffee throughout the city, BBQing my heart out, petting any dogs that make eye contact and helping the local economy by hitting patios when the mood strikes.

Physically I’m 5’11, 205, light brown complexion, shaved head and a thick black beard (now featuring white strands!) and live near King West. Ideally looking for someone local within the downtown area as one of my love languages is quality time and through past relationships, I’ve learned how much i appreciate spending time with my partner.

If any of this intrigues you, feel free to send me a chat message. On a side note, I spend way too much time on the “petsareamazing” subreddit group getting my animal fix… feel free to share any of your fav vids!

Plan to cancel my 12nt next year.,"Done a good amount of RCL cruises and currently on the Summit headed to Alaska as we figured we would see if this was a “little more nicer” than the regular RCL.  Cost was more, so have higher expectations of service. Been onboard 24H and as I sat down with my party at one of the bars, I mentioned that so far I’m unimpressed with food and beverage service all over the ship. I’m of the opinion that while I really want my next itinerary on the 12 night, I’m going to have my TA find a different provider. Strangely, everyone in my party agrees. Everything just feels off, simple things such as having to ask for a water refill at dinner and coffee refill at breakfast. The food is just ”ok,” and I’m not a foodie.  Bar service, while it gets done if you walk up, there just seems not to have any waiters anywhere. The ones I do see, you need to flag down. Again, have not had these issues on any RCL ships. While in the hot tub, a waiter walked up to one side and took two drink orders and just walked off without even asking the others and when they came back, made no eye contact and left after dropping off the drinks.

Is this just an anomaly, is there something I’m missing on the service?  Are my expectations too high to expect more than one glass of water at dinner?",0,1756595191.0,celebritycruises,26,0.4,False

I also don’t really have experience with things like this. I’ve been spending time with a guy (40M) and I’m trying to figure out if he’s genuinely interested in me or just being super generous/friendly.

Here’s what’s happened so far:

	•	First day we met, he took me out to a hibachi steak house and insisted on paying.

	•	Another time, he took me out for coffee (more than once) and covered it all.

	•	He listened to me open up about my struggles and past, was really kind about it, and then even treated me to matcha afterward.

	•	He’s offered to get drinks together a few times (his treat).

	•	He randomly bought me a birthday gift while shopping for someone else and is dropping it off soon even though my birthday isn’t for months.

	•	He’s suggested going to an amusement park and also mentioned wanting to take me out for one of those hot pot meals where you cook your own meat.

	•	He has told me that I’m very beautiful and that he enjoys talking to me.


Do these sound like signs he’s actually into me, or could it just be him being nice?

Would love some outside perspectives thank you!

My dad (59M), does not drink or smoke, no diabetes or medical conditions, tall broad man but not obese, had a seizure 2 days ago and I’m pretty worried. Here’s what happened:

* The day before he ate late, next morning had coffee without sugar, went to the beach in very hot weather, played racquetball, and only ate a small sugary wafer.
* While playing he felt dizzy, collapsed, and had a seizure (eyes rolled back, blank stare, jerking, lost consciousness, memory loss).
* We checked his blood sugar during the episode — it was **67 mg/dL**. He only woke up after IV glucose.
* MRI brain came back normal. Blood tests were done, and a transcranial Doppler is scheduled. No EEG was done (I asked but they didn’t order it).
* He feels fine now.

**My concerns:**

* Was this just hypoglycemia + dehydration, or something more serious like epilepsy?
* It’s been >16 hours since the seizure — is an EEG still useful? Should I push for a sleep-deprived or prolonged EEG?
* Should we also check his heart (ECG, Holter) to rule out fainting/arrhythmia?
* Should he avoid driving until cleared? If so, for how long?
* What’s the chance of this happening again, and does he need seizure meds after just one episode?

Any neurologists or people with similar experiences — I’d really appreciate advice. I don’t want this to happen again when he’s alone or driving.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.
I don’t drink or do drugs—unless you count caffeine (then yes, I’m basically a bean addict). My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career—bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.
You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos/piercings, or kids—because I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

The Trump team is following Putin's playbook on disruptive campaigns aimed to weaken states before a military invasion. The goal is to foment distrust and chaos—a hallmark of Russian influence operations aiming to weaken democratic institutions by muddying the truth with disinformation.

Both Russia and the MAGA movement were deeply involved in financially assisting and amplifying the ""Freedom Convoy"" that was run by Alberta separatists.  It cost Canada's economy $4 billion.

Officials in the Donald Trump administration discussed loaning Alberta $500 million to break up Canada and make it the 51st state, a prominent separatist claimed at a recorded closed meeting.

“I met the senior U.S. administrative officials just a couple steps away from the president himself,” recalled Dennis Modry, the former CEO of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a group devoted to pushing Alberta out of Canada through a provincial referendum.

“When we walked into the conference room, the first comment was ‘we recognize and support Alberta becoming the sovereign nation for the first time,’” he said.

Modry was a member of The Commonwealth of Alberta Delegation to Washington that in April traveled to the U.S. Capitol.

Right-wing Canadian influencers were accused by intelligence services of collaborating with a Russian propaganda scheme, allegedly taking funds from a pro-Moscow outlet.

Danielle Smith, Alberta's premier, is more than happy to hang out at Mar a Lago, trash talk Canada, and push for a referendum.

Pierre Poilievre promoted the ""Freedom Convoy"", brought them coffee and donuts, and endlessly tries to frame our great nation as ""broken"" and ""failing""

Poilievre's Conservative Party is an official member of the IDU, who actively worked to help Trump get elected. Stephen Harper is the chairman of the IDU. US Republican Mike Roman, the man who said 'Make them Riot' on January 6th, was Harper's assistant chairman of the IDU at the time of those insurrection riots. Mike Roman came to Canada to support Conservative strategies and was at the convoy that cost Canada's economy billions.

How much money is coming from the USA and Russia into the hands of ""influencers"" and ""separatists"" to support this information warfare aimed at the destruction of Canada?  How many websites, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter accounts are involved? 

Several associates of Donald Trump had been flagged by the Danish Police Intelligence Service for running an espionage campaign in Greenland to soften the ground ahead of a potential push by the United States to take over the island. Shortly after the report was published this week, Denmark's foreign minister summoned U.S. charge d'affaires Mark Stroh.

Trump has made no attempt to hide his lust for Greenland or Canada. 

This isn't a fight we wanted, but it is here, and everything is at stake.
