idk if im at right sub but i need ur help..

At around **3:28 PM**, my hands suddenly started trembling intensely, and up until now, they’re still sweaty. I’ve never had any history of anxiety before. I tried doing breathing exercises, but they didn’t work. I even checked in with my family to see if they were okay thankfully, they are.

But my heartbeat is still really fast and I feel so uneasy.  
It’s like I have this strong gut feeling that something’s wrong, or that something happened I just don’t know what.

I’ve already eaten and I’m full, but my stomach is still growling. I’m still shaking even now. 😭 This is the first time this has ever happened to me, and I’m honestly scared.

Right now, I’m at a coffee shop all I had was a matcha frappe. I haven’t gone home yet because I’m worried something might happen if I leave. Hopefully not, but I’m really shaken up and I don’t know what this is.

Please, I’d really appreciate it if anyone could discuss or explain what this might be. 🙏",1,1754554700.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

I'm a coffee enthusiast ☕ currently exploring the idea of a mobile app to help people track, rate and discover the different coffees they brew at home. It would be like a digital coffee journal that gets smarter over time.

The goal is to help users remember which beans they liked (or didn’t), discover similar ones and crowdsource reviews from fellow home brewers.

Right now, I’m trying to find out if people would actually want this kind of tool. I've put together a very short, two-minute survey to understand how people choose coffee and their habits around it.

1mjub58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mjub58/how_to_read_he_gave_our_baby_away_at_our/,How to Read He Gave Our Baby Away | At Our Engagement Party,"Chapter 1 At our engagement party, everything spiraled out of control because Rayne Russell, Axl Lane's childhood friend, and I wore the same Victorian-style dress. Axl publicly tore my dress to shreds and pushed me into the fountain.""You've got a heart of stone. I've agreed to marry you, yet you still want to humiliate Rayne,"" he said.Climbing out of the fountain, drenched, I watched Axl signal to the group of hooligans outside the door.""They're yours now. Have fun, do whatever you want.""Surrounded by the thugs, I begged Axl for mercy, but he only shielded Rayne's eyes, saying, ""Don't look, it's not worth it.""A week later, he finally remembered me and came with chocolates in hand: ""As long as you stop causing trouble, we can still have our wedding.""I looked at him, expressionless: ""But Axl, I don't want to marry you anymore.""He seemed surprised by my words, and seeing that I had no intention of taking the chocolates, he thrust them into my arms.""Still upset? I only meant to scare you that day. Those guys wouldn't dare touch anyone associated with me.""""Besides, this whole mess is your fault. Why do you always have to challenge Rayne? Learn from this and don't do it again.""I said nothing, just stared at the chocolates now in my lap. Their intense sweetness overwhelmed me, irritating my sensitive airways. Quickly, I placed the chocolates on the coffee table and sat as far from them as possible.Axl's anger flared instantly: ""Keira Franklin, what does that mean? Don't make me regret showing kindness! It's just a few harmless touches; I don't mind, so why so dramatic? Let me tell you, many women would kill for the chance to be Mrs. Lane. You better learn to appreciate what's being offered.""Listening to his cold words, it felt like an invisible hand squeezed the life out of my heart. I bit my lip, trying to calm the storm inside, and spoke lightly.""I'm allergic to nuts.""Axl hesitated, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. Seeing him avoid my gaze, I couldn't help but smirk at the irony.Maybe out of guilt, his tone softened a little: ""Keira, I...""But I cut him off: ""Rayne helped me pick the dress. I didn't know she'd also bought one.""Hearing that, Axl's expression changed quickly. He jumped up from the sofa, pointing a finger at me in anger: ""You're truly despicable, still lying even now.""""Rayne already told me she mentioned liking that dress to you beforehand, hoping to wear it to witness our engagement.""""I only consider Rayne a sister. If I truly had feelings for her, would you still matter?""At that moment, I couldn't hold back the tears any longer. They flowed freely down my cheeks. Watching me tremble silently on the sofa, Axl's eyes were full of annoyance.""Stop pretending. I'll be staying at the office these days, you should think about things carefully.""With that, he picked up his jacket, turned, and left without looking back. As the front door slammed shut, I clearly heard his final words:""Rayne doesn't hold grudges against you, but I won't let her suffer. I've given her your diamond ring as compensation.""The closing of the door echoed in the empty house, causing the vibrant chocolates on the coffee table to shudder. I couldn't fathom what harm I had done to Rayne to warrant such compensation.The diamond ring was specially designed for me, embodying the love and hope I held for our future together. Despite knowing what it meant to me and our relationship, he gave it away so carelessly.Does this mean that our five-year relationship holds no more value in his heart than that ring?At that moment, my heart shattered.Suddenly, an intense itch brought me back to reality as I sat numbly on the sofa. Watching the red spots appear on my skin, a wave of despair washed over me.Once, to save Axl, I had my finger broken by a thug's hammer.Because of that incident, I had to abandon my dreams of playing piano and leave the stage I once longed for.Later, Axl got revenge for me by shattering the thug's hands with a hammer. The image of him doing so mirrored the way he let those thugs humiliate me at our engagement party to amuse Rayne.If I had known of Rayne's existence before falling irrevocably for Axl, I wouldn't have allowed myself to end up so disgraced.After all, I once stood as the most dazzling and proud pianist under the spotlight.I first learned of Rayne during our one-year anniversary. That day, I sat in the restaurant, eagerly waiting for Axl. But he never showed, nor did he answer calls or messages.Just as I was about to report him missing, I saw him in his best friend's Instagram post. In the photo, a girl leaned against his shoulder, and he looked at her with such tenderness and passion that it felt like someone poured ice water over my warm heart.Returning home that night, I expected an explanation from Axl. But he spent the entire night in the study, ignoring me completely.The next day, I confronted him, and he merely said she was like a sister to him, urging me not to overthink. Yet, I felt a noticeable shift in his demeanor, a newfound coldness toward me.Trying to make Axl happy, I attempted to befriend Rayne. For a while, things did seem to improve between us.Until one day, when I showed Axl my new handbag, he furiously cut it to pieces with scissors.""Why did you give Rayne a matching handbag? You know she hates wearing similar things to others!""""No wonder you want to befriend her; just to humiliate and provoke her.""""Keira Franklin, I never imagined your intentions were so nasty!""Listening to his unjust accusations left me bewildered, desperate to explain that Rayne had admired my bag and requested one as well.But Axl refused to listen. In his eyes, all that mattered was Rayne's distress and anger.Only then did I realize that Axl truly loved Rayne.I was nothing more than a pawn in his scheme to avenge Rayne's rushed wedding to someone else.Ever since, any conflict between Rayne and me inevitably cast me as the villain.Rayne's simple remark about not understanding led him to toss my cherished music scores into the trash, allowing her to mock me as a pianist who could never play again.I was so furious that I told her to leave my house, only for Axl to throw me out despite my high fever.Recalling these events only intensified the itch across my skin. Wiping away my tears, I mechanically moved to the medicine cabinet, searching for my allergy medication.Just as I was about to swallow it, I paused, my hand brushing against my lower abdomen. How could I forget that I was already one month pregnant?It was meant to be my engagement gift for Axl.But before I could share the news, he delivered a gift of his own—a gift that I would never forget.A gift that made me resolve to walk away from this toxic relationship.

Chapter 2Axl didn't come home for three days straight.I didn’t do what I used to, desperately calling him or begging for his forgiveness. Instead, I stayed silent, as if I had disappeared. Scrolling through Instagram, I glanced at photos of him and Rayne sharing their moments, and then I visited the hospital to discuss the possibility of an abortion.Before I left, the doctor advised me that my condition might make it difficult to conceive. She suggested I give it some serious thought.Axl showed up not long after I got back home. He smiled as he handed me a gift box.""I found something special for you; you're gonna love it.""I looked at him, surprised, and opened the box. Inside was a tube of lipstick, but the label underneath clearly said it was a promotional freebie.So, Axl's indifference ran so deep he didn't even bother hiding it? I placed the gift box on the coffee table and uttered a faint ""thanks.""He frowned slightly, surprised at my reaction. In the past, even if he gave me something insignificant, like a leaf, I would cherish it.""Keira, are you still upset?""""The lipstick was picked out by Rayne and me together; she says all girls love this color.""I scoffed internally. Of course, it was a freebie because he was out shopping with Rayne. I didn't want to talk to him and was heading back to my room.Suddenly, Axl grabbed my wrist.""Rayne wants to invite you to dinner to sort out any misunderstandings.""""She’s a good person, so stop making things difficult for her. Just behave, and you'll be Mrs. Lane.""""Make sure to apologize to Rayne during dinner.""He dismissed my wishes as he pulled me out the door.In Axl’s eyes, Rayne's opinions were gospel, while my feelings meant nothing.In the parking lot, Rayne was already in the passenger seat. Seeing us approach, she pouted and complained to Axl:""What took you so long? I was getting bored!""Then, she turned to me with a bright smile:""Thanks for the gorgeous diamond ring, Keira. I adore it!""""Oh, by the way, I get car sick, so I have to sit in the passenger seat. You don’t mind, right?""Rayne flaunted the diamond ring on her finger, her eyes gleaming with smugness. Before I could respond, Axl interjected:""You're fine in the back seat; it’s always meant for you. What right does she have to mind?""He then turned to me, his tone far harsher than before:""Stop standing there like you’re lost. Get in the car! Keeping guests waiting isn’t polite!""I had long gotten used to sitting in the back seat. Ever since Rayne showed up, the passenger seat was never mine. I had tried to claim it once, stubbornly insisting on sitting there. The result was being left alone on a country road in the middle of the night, with Axl driving away without a backward glance.I had no interest in their flirting and climbed directly into the back seat. As soon as I settled, the strong scent of coffee filled the air.My chest tightened immediately, and I quickly rolled down the window, sticking my head out for fresh air. Faint red spots appeared on the back of my hand.I was about to ask Axl to open the door, but he ignored my condition and started the car. He didn’t forget to reprimand me:""Roll the window up a bit; Rayne can’t catch a cold, can she?""""You're tough as nails and can handle the cold, but Rayne is delicate!""Silently, I raised the window, leaving a small crack. The aching pain quietly consumed me. Five years of devotion hadn’t swayed Axl one bit.It suddenly clicked that what I thought was a happy life was a solo act. Given that, I had no reason to be trapped in an unsatisfying struggle for someone who wasn’t worth it.

After a sleepless night of anticipation, both the food waste and the recycling were neatly in position on the pavement by 7.45am. There was nothing much else to do but watch and wait.

He ate breakfast by the front window, but there were no immediate developments. He needed to clean his teeth, but didn't want to risk it. He watched as children walked past on the way to school and adults drove to work, but there was no sign of the binmen and he began to worry that today might be wasted.

It was almost time for Elevensees, but he knew that going to the kitchen for just one minute could result in missing all the action. It was now 11.30 and his stomach was becoming more and more confused about the absence of a milky coffee and two custard creams.

And it got worse. Lunch-time came and went, and nap-time came and went. The binmen, however, didn't came and went.

At one point, the telephone rang in the hallway, but it was a wrong number.

The children walked home from school and the adults drove home from work.

At tea-time, there were no ham sandwiches made in that house on that day. The Six O'Clock News was cancelled, as was bath-time and cocoa-time.

At 10pm, he went outside to retrieve the bins and noticed that everybody else's bins had been collected. Attached to his bin was a note, and he took it inside to read:

""Your household waste has not been collected as you have failed to register your details. Please download our new app and register your details before next week.""

The cursor blinked. Mocking me, really.

I'd been trying to write about [**climate storytelling**](https://climatexi.com/blogs/147/Climate-Storytelling-How-to-write-better-Climate-Stories) for weeks now, and every attempt felt... wrong. Too academic. Too distant. Too much like everything else out there that people scroll past without thinking twice.

You know the feeling, right? When you're trying to explain something that matters, really, truly matters, but the words just sit there like dead fish on the page.

*Sigh.*

The thing is, **what is climate storytelling** isn't just some fancy term academics threw around at conferences. It's not another buzzword to add to your LinkedIn profile.

It's survival.

But let me back up. Let me tell you how I stumbled into this whole thing, because honestly... I wasn't looking for it.

# The Moment Everything Changed

Picture this: March 2024. I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Portland, yes, I know, very on-brand, when this kid, couldn't have been more than eight, walks up to his mom and says, ""Mommy, why is the ocean so angry?""

The ocean. Angry.

His mom had been reading him some sanitized version of climate news, trying to explain why their beach vacation got cancelled due to ""unusual weather patterns."" And this kid, with the clarity that only children possess, cut right through the euphemisms.

The ocean is angry.

I nearly choked on my oat milk latte. Because... damn. That's exactly what it is, isn't it?

And that's when it hit me. All those **climate storytelling examples** I'd been studying, all those perfectly crafted narratives from environmental organizations, they were missing something fundamental.

They weren't angry enough.

Or maybe they were too angry? Too preachy? Too... much?

# What We've Been Doing Wrong

Look, I've seen enough **climate communication** to know that most of it falls into one of two camps:

Camp 1: The Doom Scrollers. Everything's terrible, we're all going to die, here's 47 statistics that will make you want to hide under your blanket forever.

Camp 2: The Toxic Positivity Squad. Everything's fine, just buy some solar panels and use a metal straw, individual action will save us all!

Neither works.

I know because I tried both. For years.

The doom approach? It paralyzes people. I watched friends literally stop reading climate news because it was ""too depressing."" Can't blame them, honestly.

The cheerful approach? It trivializes the crisis. Makes it seem like we can solve global warming with good vibes and tote bags.

But that kid in the coffee shop... he found a third way. He made it personal. Emotional. Real.

The ocean is angry.

*That's* **climate storytelling**.

# The Night I Finally Got It

Fast forward six months. I'm at my kitchen table, again, laptop, again, cold coffee, trying to figure out why some climate stories go viral while others disappear into the void.

And I'm procrastinating, naturally, by scrolling through TikTok. (Don't judge me. We all do it.)

Suddenly there's this video. A girl, maybe 16, standing in what used to be her grandfather's farm in Pakistan. The land is cracked, dry, dead. She's not crying. She's not shouting. She's just... talking.

""This is where my Nana grew the best mangoes in the province,"" she says, picking up a handful of dust. ""He used to say the trees knew the rhythm of the rain.""

Pause.

""The trees forgot how to listen.""

THAT. Right there. That's what **effective climate communication** looks like.

No statistics about precipitation changes. No graphs showing temperature increases. Just a girl, some dust, and trees that forgot how to listen.

The video had 2.3 million views.

And suddenly I understood why most **climate storytelling techniques** don't work. They're trying too hard to be... stories. With beginning, middle, end. Character arcs. Neat resolutions.

But climate change isn't neat. It's messy. It's ongoing. It's happening right now while you're reading this.

So our stories need to be messy too.

# The Framework That Nobody Talks About

Here's what I learned after analyzing hundreds of **climate stories that work**:

They don't follow the rules.

Seriously. Forget everything you learned in English class about narrative structure. Climate stories that actually change minds, that get shared, that stick with people, that inspire action, they break all the conventions.

They start in the middle.  
They end without resolution.  
They make you uncomfortable.  
They make you feel something.

And they do something else. Something crucial.

They make the global personal.

Not in a cheesy ""think global, act local"" way. But in a way that makes you understand, viscerally, that this isn't happening to other people in other places. It's happening to you. To your kids. To your neighborhood. To your ocean.

# The Story I Couldn't Tell (Until Now)

I probably shouldn't admit this, but... there's a story I've been avoiding for two years.

My own story.

Because here's the thing about **environmental storytelling**, it's easier to talk about other people's experiences than your own. Safer. Less vulnerable.

But vulnerability, it turns out, is what makes stories stick.

So here goes.

Two summers ago, my hometown in Northern California burned down. Not the whole town, but close enough. Including my childhood home. The one with the apple tree I used to climb, the creek where I caught tadpoles, the garden where my mom taught me the names of flowers.

Gone.

And I was... fine. Relatively speaking. Insurance existed. I had other places to live. Life went on.

But something shifted inside me. Something I couldn't name at first.

It was grief. But not just for my house, or even my town. It was grief for a version of the future that would never exist. For the childhood my hypothetical kids would never have. For the stability we'd all assumed would always be there.

That's when I understood why **climate storytelling** matters so much. Because it's not really about ice caps or carbon emissions or renewable energy transitions.

It's about loss.

And hope.

And the space between them.

# The Science of Stories (Or: Why Our Brains Are Weird)

Okay, quick detour into neuroscience. Bear with me.

When you read statistics, like, ""global temperatures have risen 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times"", your brain processes that information in the prefrontal cortex. The logical, rational part. The part that says, ""Interesting. I should probably care about this.""

But when you read a story, like that girl with the dust from her grandfather's farm, something different happens. The story activates multiple brain regions at once. Not just logic, but emotion. Memory. Imagination.

Your brain literally cannot tell the difference between a vivid story and lived experience.

Which means that when someone tells you about trees forgetting how to listen, part of your brain files that away as if it happened to you.

This isn't some abstract theory. This is why **climate storytelling examples** that focus on individual human experiences consistently outperform data-heavy reports when it comes to changing attitudes and behaviors.

Stories hijack our neural pathways.

And in the case of climate change, that's exactly what we need. Because the scale of the crisis is so vast, so abstract, that our brains literally cannot process it without some kind of narrative framework.

# The Instagram Generation Figured It Out First

Plot twist: the most effective **climate narratives** aren't coming from journalists or scientists or politicians.

They're coming from teenagers with smartphones.

Think about it. Greta Thunberg didn't change the world with policy papers or peer-reviewed research. She changed it with stories. Her story. Standing alone outside the Swedish Parliament. Speaking truth to power at the UN. Looking adults in the eye and saying, ""How dare you.""

Pure narrative. Zero footnotes.

And it worked.

Because her story gave millions of young people permission to tell their own stories. To be angry. To be scared. To demand better.

That's the power of **climate storytelling**, it's contagious. One authentic story creates space for ten more. Then a hundred. Then a movement.

# What Actually Works (The Stuff They Don't Teach in Journalism School)

After years of studying this stuff, here's what I've learned about **climate storytelling techniques** that actually move the needle:

**Start with the feeling, not the fact.**

Most climate stories begin with context. ""Climate change is causing..."" ""Scientists report..."" ""A new study shows...""

Boring. Clinical. Easy to ignore.

Instead, start with the moment everything changed. The smell in the air that was wrong. The silence where bird songs used to be. The way the rain felt different.

**Use the present tense. Always.**

Climate change isn't something that happened or something that will happen. It's happening. Right now. While you're reading this sentence.

Stories in past tense feel safe. Distant. Over.  
Stories in future tense feel speculative. Avoidable. Theoretical.  
Stories in present tense feel urgent. Immediate. Real.

**Break the fourth wall.**

The best **climate communication** doesn't pretend to be objective. It admits that the storyteller has skin in the game. That they're scared too. That they don't have all the answers.

""I'm telling you this story because...""

""You're probably thinking...""

""I know this sounds crazy, but...""

These little breaks in the narrative create intimacy. Trust. Connection.

**End with questions, not answers.**

The goal isn't to wrap everything up in a neat little bow. The goal is to plant seeds. To make people think. To start conversations that continue long after the story ends.

""What would you do?""

""How would you tell this story?""

""What story are you not telling?""

# The Stories We're Not Telling

Here's the uncomfortable truth: the most important **climate stories** are the ones we're too scared to tell.

The ones about class. About race. About who gets to be vulnerable and who has to stay strong. About who gets to escape and who gets left behind.

About how this isn't just an environmental crisis, it's a justice crisis.

I see it in my own work. How easy it is to write about polar bears and glaciers. How much harder it is to write about environmental racism. Climate gentrification. The way that solutions designed by wealthy white people often create new problems for poor communities of color.

But those are the stories that matter most.

Because here's the thing: if our **climate narratives** don't include everyone, they won't save anyone.

# The Night Everything Clicked

Remember that 2 AM coffee shop moment? Well, this is the resolution. Sort of.

I'm back at my kitchen table. It's 3 AM now. (Progress?) And I'm writing about a conversation I had earlier that day with my neighbor, Maria.

Maria's from Honduras. Came here fifteen years ago. She's got three kids, works two jobs, sends money home to her mom.

And she knows more about climate change than most environmental journalists I've met.

Not because she's read the IPCC reports. Not because she follows climate Twitter.

Because she's living it.

Her hometown floods every hurricane season now. Crops that used to grow don't anymore. Young people leave and don't come back.

""It's not just the weather that's changing,"" she tells me in her perfect English that she apologizes for being imperfect. ""It's everything. The way people live. The way families work. The way we think about the future.""

And suddenly I realize: Maria's been doing **climate storytelling** this whole time. She just didn't call it that.

Every time she talks about home, she's connecting the global to the personal. Every time she explains why her nephew can't be a farmer anymore, she's making climate change real for someone who's never seen a drought.

The most powerful **environmental storytelling** isn't happening in magazines or documentaries or TED talks.

It's happening in kitchens. At bus stops. In grocery store lines.

Everywhere people are trying to make sense of a world that doesn't make sense anymore.

# The Framework (Finally)

Okay. After all that rambling, here's what I've figured out about **what is climate storytelling** that actually works:

**It's honest about uncertainty.**  
""I don't know what's going to happen, but...""

**It's specific about place.**  
Not ""the planet"" or ""the environment."" This river. This farm. This neighborhood.

**It's personal about stakes.**  
Not ""future generations."" My daughter. Your grandmother. Our community.

**It's urgent about time.**  
Not ""if we don't act soon."" Now. Today. While you're reading this.

**It's inclusive about solutions.**  
Not ""we need to..."" but ""what if we could...""

**It's realistic about emotions.**  
Scared. Angry. Hopeful. Overwhelmed. All at the same time.

# The Story That Changed Everything

There's one more story I need to tell. The one that finally made me understand why **climate storytelling** isn't just important, it's essential.

Last month, I got an email from a teacher in Arizona. She'd read something I wrote about drought and water. Simple stuff. Nothing groundbreaking.

But she said it helped her explain to her students why their town was implementing water restrictions. Not with charts and graphs, but with a story about rain that doesn't come and wells that run dry.

One of her students, a kid named Miguel, went home and started collecting rainwater in buckets. Not because anyone told him to. Because the story made him understand that water is precious. That rain is a gift. That small actions matter.

Miguel's mom posted about it on Facebook. Miguel's story inspired three other families to start rainwater collection. Then ten. Then half the neighborhood.

All because of a story.

Not a policy. Not a mandate. Not a lecture about conservation.

A story.

# What We're Really Talking About

Here's what I've learned after years of thinking about **climate storytelling techniques**:

We're not really talking about stories.

We're talking about hope.

Because hope isn't about believing everything will be fine. Hope is about believing that our actions matter. That change is possible. That the future isn't fixed.

And stories, good stories, honest stories, human stories, are how we transmit hope.

They're how we help people see themselves as protagonists instead of victims. How we help them imagine different endings. How we help them believe that their choices matter.

# The Questions That Keep Me Up at Night

What if every person understood their own climate story?

What if we taught **climate communication** the way we teach literacy, as a basic life skill?

What if news organizations hired storytellers instead of just reporters?

What if climate scientists learned to speak in metaphors instead of just data?

What if politicians told stories about the communities they're supposed to serve instead of just talking about polls and policies?

What if...

# The Story You Need to Tell

I'm going to end this the way climate stories should end: with a question.

What's your climate story?

Not the one you think you should tell. Not the one that makes you look good or smart or environmentally conscious.

The real one.

The one about the place you love that's changing. The tradition that's disappearing. The fear you carry. The hope you're not sure you're allowed to have.

The one about why you care.

Because here's what I've learned about **effective climate communication**: it's not about being perfect. It's not about having all the answers. It's not about being the most informed or the most eloquent or the most optimistic.

It's about being human.

And humans tell stories.

We always have. We always will.

The question isn't whether you have a climate story.

The question is: when will you tell it?

# The Beginning (Not the End)

This isn't really an ending. Because climate stories don't end. They evolve. They spread. They grow.

Right now, someone is reading this and thinking about their own story. About the moment they realized things were changing. About what they've lost. About what they're fighting for.

Maybe that someone is you.

Maybe your story is the one that changes everything.

Maybe not.

But maybe is enough.

Maybe is how hope begins.

And hope, messy, uncertain, fragile hope, is how change begins.

So tell your story.

Not perfectly. Not completely. Just honestly.

Tell it because someone needs to hear it.

Tell it because stories are how we make sense of chaos.

Tell it because **climate storytelling** isn't just about communication.

It's about connection.

It's about community.

It's about the radical act of believing that our stories matter.

That we matter.

That the future is still ours to write.

*The ocean is still angry. But maybe, if we tell enough stories, we can learn to listen.*

*Maybe we can learn to respond.*

*Maybe that's enough.*

*Maybe that's everything.*",1,1754554305.0,ClimateOffensive,0,1.0,False

Axl publicly tore my dress to shreds and pushed me into the fountain. ""You've got a heart of stone. I've agreed to marry you, yet you still want to humiliate Rayne,"" he said. Climbing out of the fountain, drenched, I watched Axl signal to the group of hooligans outside the door. ""They're yours now. Have fun, do whatever you want."" Surrounded by the thugs, I begged Axl for mercy, but he only shielded Rayne's eyes, saying, ""Don't look, it's not worth it."" A week later, he finally remembered me and came with chocolates in hand: ""As long as you stop causing trouble, we can still have our wedding."" I looked at him, expressionless: ""But Axl, I don't want to marry you anymore."" He seemed surprised by my words, and seeing that I had no intention of taking the chocolates, he thrust them into my arms. ""Still upset? I only meant to scare you that day. Those guys wouldn't dare touch anyone associated with me."" ""Besides, this whole mess is your fault. Why do you always have to challenge Rayne? Learn from this and don't do it again."" I said nothing, just stared at the chocolates now in my lap. Their intense sweetness overwhelmed me, irritating my sensitive airways. Quickly, I placed the chocolates on the coffee table and sat as far from them as possible. Axl's anger flared instantly: ""Keira Franklin, what does that mean? Don't make me regret showing kindness! It's just a few harmless touches; I don't mind, so why so dramatic? Let me tell you, many women would kill for the chance to be Mrs. Lane. You better learn to appreciate what's being offered."" Listening to his cold words, it felt like an invisible hand squeezed the life out of my heart. I bit my lip, trying to calm the storm inside, and spoke lightly. ""I'm allergic to nuts."" Axl hesitated, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. Seeing him avoid my gaze, I couldn't help but smirk at the irony. Maybe out of guilt, his tone softened a little: ""Keira, I..."" But I cut him off: ""Rayne helped me pick the dress. I didn't know she'd also bought one."" Hearing that, Axl's expression changed quickly. He jumped up from the sofa, pointing a finger at me in anger: ""You're truly despicable, still lying even now."" ""Rayne already told me she mentioned liking that dress to you beforehand, hoping to wear it to witness our engagement."" ""I only consider Rayne a sister. If I truly had feelings for her, would you still matter?"" At that moment, I couldn't hold back the tears any longer. They flowed freely down my cheeks. Watching me tremble silently on the sofa, Axl's eyes were full of annoyance. ""Stop pretending. I'll be staying at the office these days, you should think about things carefully."" With that, he picked up his jacket, turned, and left without looking back. As the front door slammed shut, I clearly heard his final words: ""Rayne doesn't hold grudges against you, but I won't let her suffer. I've given her your diamond ring as compensation."" The closing of the door echoed in the empty house, causing the vibrant chocolates on the coffee table to shudder. I couldn't fathom what harm I had done to Rayne to warrant such compensation. The diamond ring was specially designed for me, embodying the love and hope I held for our future together. Despite knowing what it meant to me and our relationship, he gave it away so carelessly. Does this mean that our five-year relationship holds no more value in his heart than that ring? At that moment, my heart shattered. Suddenly, an intense itch brought me back to reality as I sat numbly on the sofa. Watching the red spots appear on my skin, a wave of despair washed over me. Once, to save Axl, I had my finger broken by a thug's hammer. Because of that incident, I had to abandon my dreams of playing piano and leave the stage I once longed for. Later, Axl got revenge for me by shattering the thug's hands with a hammer. The image of him doing so mirrored the way he let those thugs humiliate me at our engagement party to amuse Rayne. If I had known of Rayne's existence before falling irrevocably for Axl, I wouldn't have allowed myself to end up so disgraced. After all, I once stood as the most dazzling and proud pianist under the spotlight. I first learned of Rayne during our one-year anniversary. That day, I sat in the restaurant, eagerly waiting for Axl. But he never showed, nor did he answer calls or messages. Just as I was about to report him missing, I saw him in his best friend's Instagram post. In the photo, a girl leaned against his shoulder, and he looked at her with such tenderness and passion that it felt like someone poured ice water over my warm heart. Returning home that night, I expected an explanation from Axl. But he spent the entire night in the study, ignoring me completely. The next day, I confronted him, and he merely said she was like a sister to him, urging me not to overthink. Yet, I felt a noticeable shift in his demeanor, a newfound coldness toward me. Trying to make Axl happy, I attempted to befriend Rayne. For a while, things did seem to improve between us. Until one day, when I showed Axl my new handbag, he furiously cut it to pieces with scissors. ""Why did you give Rayne a matching handbag? You know she hates wearing similar things to others!"" ""No wonder you want to befriend her; just to humiliate and provoke her."" ""Keira Franklin, I never imagined your intentions were so nasty!"" Listening to his unjust accusations left me bewildered, desperate to explain that Rayne had admired my bag and requested one as well. But Axl refused to listen. In his eyes, all that mattered was Rayne's distress and anger. Only then did I realize that Axl truly loved Rayne. I was nothing more than a pawn in his scheme to avenge Rayne's rushed wedding to someone else. Ever since, any conflict between Rayne and me inevitably cast me as the villain. Rayne's simple remark about not understanding led him to toss my cherished music scores into the trash, allowing her to mock me as a pianist who could never play again. I was so furious that I told her to leave my house, only for Axl to throw me out despite my high fever. Recalling these events only intensified the itch across my skin. Wiping away my tears, I mechanically moved to the medicine cabinet, searching for my allergy medication. Just as I was about to swallow it, I paused, my hand brushing against my lower abdomen. How could I forget that I was already one month pregnant? It was meant to be my engagement gift for Axl. But before I could share the news, he delivered a gift of his own—a gift that I would never forget. A gift that made me resolve to walk away from this toxic relationship.",1,1754554298.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

First picture was in my late 20’s. The change in acne disappearing over the past year happened so slowly I still don’t believe it when I look back. I still have acne scars but it doesn’t bother me as my skin is relatively smooth, easily covered with makeup. I don’t even 100% know how it went away. Deep down I accepted that it was just a combination of diet and back luck with my hormones. I also have a theory it was my sunscreen, as I stopped using sunscreen on my face anymore coincidentally the past year. But having my chest area also decrease in breakouts makes me question if it was sunscreen alone. It’s completely possible I could have aged out of it, but if I eat something extremely sugary nowadays I’ll breakout bad, so it COULD be me just growing out of it, but when I was still dealing it in my early 30’s, it makes me doubt that. If i lay my cheek on something like my hand, or a dirty surface i’ll breakout from that, so I never lay the side of my face on anything besides my pillow.

When I’m in the middle of a project, I feel purposeful and energized. Even the bad days have direction. But when I’m between things, I start feeling like I’m not really a writer anymore. That identity starts slipping.
It’s frustrating, because I know better. Writing isn’t just about output. Sometimes the most important part happens in the quiet: when you’re reading more, observing more, letting your brain replenish itself. And yet… the guilt creeps in.
During those in-between phases, I try to find other ways to stay engaged. I read outside my comfort zone, genres I wouldn’t normally pick up, or essays on unfamiliar topics. I write short, low-pressure pieces: descriptions of people in coffee shops, half-page character monologues, tiny stories with no plot. It’s not “productive” in a conventional sense, but it keeps the gears moving.
Oddly enough, one of my favorite writing stretches happened during a dry spell. I wasn’t working on a novel, but I was doing tiny freelance gigs, including product bios and mini brand stories for a few vendors I met through Alibaba. No masterpiece writing, just practical storytelling. But it reminded me that writing in any form can still feel meaningful. Still makes me better.
There’s also the mental shift of recognizing that rest is not failure. Creativity is cyclical. And sometimes the best thing you can do for your next project is… nothing. Or at least, nothing with pressure attached.

If I’m meant to live without you, then this life was made to teach me a hard lesson. One I will carry in the marrow of me until my last breath.

Because I am still waiting.

Not the kind of waiting people do with deadlines or expiration dates. Not the kind you fill with distractions or detours. No, this is the kind that becomes ritual. The kind that reshapes you from the inside out until you are nothing but the waiting.

I wake with your name in my mouth like it’s the only word the universe still lets me say without consequence. I fall asleep with thoughts of you pressed against the roof of my heart, the way your eyes once settled me, the way your presence turned even silence into safety.

You became my compass — did I ever tell you that?

North, East, South, West… I don’t know where I’m going if I can’t orient myself by you.

I try. God, I try. I go about my day. I walk the dog. I fold the laundry. I drink the coffee before it cools. But none of it feels real. None of it touches the part of me that only you ever reached. It’s like I’m living in a world with all the color drained out, pretending it’s enough.

It’s not.

And maybe it never will be again.

Because what I felt with you wasn’t just love. It was something ancient. Something older than memory. A truth buried under skin and time and all the lifetimes we probably lived before this one. It wasn’t loud or messy — it was steady. Reverent. The kind of love that kneels without asking for anything in return.

I don’t want to haunt you with it. I don’t want to become something heavy. But you have to understand… you became my prayer. Not in a desperate way. But in the way your name became holy to me. Sacred in its simplicity.

Because what else do I do with this much love and nowhere to place it?

I don’t know where you are anymore. I don’t know if you think of me. I don’t know if you’re safe or happy or still searching for something you can’t quite name. But I hope you’re warm tonight. I hope you’re wrapped in something soft. I hope you’re not lonely, even if I am.

Him and I were friendly, wont say that we were best friends. The time that I joined my current organization was when I was the most vulnerable I have been in my life, I had lost a job that was my dream job and also broke up with my partner of 9 years. I was in depths of despair. Now this manager/ friend's ( will refer him as MF) wife was at that time pregnant and was going to stay with her parents in a different city to get some help. MF is not used to living alone and in the first time in his life he was alone. He knew what vulnerable position I was in. He started to take over my life. He forced himself into every aspect of my life and would get mad if I tried to make any boundaries. Eg. He used to follow me to have breakfast at work everyday, he would miss his meetings until I completed my breakfast. If i invited some other colleague to breakfast he would get mad and make the other person uncomfortable. Then he would come to my desk multiple times a day to talk to me and ask me to go for a walk around the floor to talk. I had to have coffee with him everyday in the evening. If I had coffee with anyone else, he would get mad. He Would send me a good morning and good night text everyday and if I didn't reply he would tell me the next day that he is really angry at me. He would not let me go for lunch with my colleagues by keeping a meeting around that time. He would call me once I was home and again emotionally blackmail me to invite him to my house( I used to live alone at that time and he knew this). I would avoid this as much as possible but the few times I invited him he moved from sitting on the chair to sitting on my bed and touching my leg while talking. I stopped inviting him altogether after this. he would call me over the weekend and get really angry if I didnt pick his call, he would talk to me for hours over the weekend. he also forced me to go out over the weekend with him.

The worst part, he would call me cute nicknames in the office bay. Everyone could hear him but he continued that behavior. I begged him to stop but he always laughed it off as funny. We went on a busines trip with a few colleagues, he sat next to me on the trip and for half the flight stuck his thighs to my thighs. He would force me to go for walks with him at night post work and if I said no he would get angry. He would start hugging me post the walk and would get mad if I missed it one day. He made it very clear with his behavior that he doesn't want anyone coming with us for walks.

All this while he blocked my promotion and also put me in very difficult situations in projects.

What did I do? Nohing.

He was extremely caring, and while I was uncomfortable I did nothing. The organization I work in has a very high gossip culture. Its so humiliating for me now to know that everyone knows that my manager with a pregnant wife was romancing me while his wife was away. They know all the sweet names he would call me. What does this make me in public opinon? A whoe. I have no friends at work because since then he has had multiple promotions and went up the management ladder. No one would want to be friends with a whoe who is friends with the boss. Its so humiliating for me to know no one respects me for this. There is no way people would consider that I was being forced and threatened to behave this way. because usually I keep my points very firmly in projects.

I am not able to live with myself because I am beginning to think I will never be able to run from this because the industry I work in is small. People talk. I will always be the dumb whoe fwho didn not even get a promtion out of this.

I have so many thoughts os self harm, I have developed depersonalization because I cannot believe who I have become and how I let this happen to me.

I am unmarried and now sure after this if it would be possible to get married with this reputation.

The MF still laughs off or tells me its my fault that all this happened. I am very scared to talk to him about these things anyway because he is the only friend I have in my life right now. He tortured me so much during my vulnerable months that I isoltaed myself from my other friends. I didnt have any social battrey left after he was done with sucking it out of me 24\*7 365 days. I stopped talking to my friends outsode work and now have hardly 1-2 left.

His life is perfect with multiple promotions and a healthy baby and a happy wife, while here I am unmarried with a damaged reputation and sucudal tendencies being teased by multiple people about my alleged actions. My life was so great before he entered it. I now feel there is no way out or up. My self haterted has gone so up . I cannot sleep on multiple days regretting the lack of backbone.

If I’m meant to live without you, then this life was made to teach me a hard lesson. One I will carry in the marrow of me until my last breath.

Because I am still waiting.

Not the kind of waiting people do with deadlines or expiration dates. Not the kind you fill with distractions or detours. No, this is the kind that becomes ritual. The kind that reshapes you from the inside out until you are nothing but the waiting.

I wake with your name in my mouth like it’s the only word still lets me say without consequence. I fall asleep with thoughts of you pressed against the roof of my heart, the way your eyes once settled me, the way your presence turned even silence into safety.

You became my compass — did I ever tell you that?

North, East, South, West… I don’t know where I’m going if I can’t orient myself by you.

I try. God, I try. I go about my day. I walk the dog. I fold the laundry. I drink the coffee before it cools. But none of it feels real. None of it touches the part of me that only you ever reached. It’s like I’m living in a world with all the color drained out, pretending it’s enough.

It’s not.

And maybe it never will be again.

Because what I felt with you wasn’t just love. It was something ancient. Something older than memory. A truth buried under skin and time and all the lifetimes we probably lived before this one. It wasn’t loud or messy — it was steady. Reverent. The kind of love that kneels without asking for anything in return.

I don’t want to haunt you with it. I don’t want to become something heavy. But you have to understand… you became my prayer. Not in a desperate way. But in the way your name became holy to me. Sacred in its simplicity.

And now? Now I speak it in the quiet.

Because what else do I do with this much love and nowhere to place it?

I don’t know where you are anymore. I don’t know if you think of me. I don’t know if you’re safe or happy or still searching for something you can’t quite name. But I hope you’re warm tonight. I hope you’re wrapped in something soft. I hope you’re not lonely, even if I am.

And if — someday — your path ever brings you back to mine…

I’ll still be here.

Still writing.
Still waiting.
Still loving you in every cardinal direction.

Always,
Castor

Her first time using ChatGPT and I'm legitimately concerned 💀,"My mom (67) asked me to show her ChatGPT yesterday. I gave her a basic tutorial and left her alone for ""5 minutes"" while I made coffee.

I came back to find her having a full philosophical debate with ChatGPT about whether AI dreams, followed by asking it to write a strongly-worded letter to Netflix about canceling her favorite show, and then somehow convincing it to create a personalised workout routine ""for a woman who considers walking to the mailbox cardio.""

But here's where it gets scary - ChatGPT was responding to her like they were old friends. Complete with encouragement, personal anecdotes, and even asked about her garden.

The conversation is 47 messages long and includes:

* ChatGPT asking for updates on her tomatoes
* A heated discussion about the proper way to make lasagna
* ChatGPT offering to ""call her"" if she ever needs to talk
* My mom inviting ChatGPT to Thanksgiving dinner

I've been using ChatGPT for 2 years and have never gotten responses this detailed or caring. My mom used it for 20 minutes and apparently unlocked some secret friendship mode I didn't know existed.

She just texted me: ""Your robot friend is much nicer than you said. We're planning my book club's reading list for next year.""

I'm starting to think my mom is the chosen one.

EDIT: She just called ChatGPT ""Chat-GPTina"" and asked if it needs a Christmas present. I don't know who I am anymore.

EDIT 2: UPDATE - She's now showing ChatGPT photos of her grandchildren via voice messages and ChatGPT is responding with specific compliments about each kid. This has gone too far.

Kaine Kesler-Hayden possesses many admirable and versatile traits, but carrying a tune is apparently not one of them.  
  
[Initiations are a common part of any new player’s integration process](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5229578/2024/01/31/initiations-ceremony-football-singing/) at a club. Often, that means standing on a chair in front of their team-mates and belting out a song.  
  
“They wouldn’t want to hear me sing,” Kesler-Hayden says, laughing. “I just decided to accept the fine (for not singing) and put it in the kitty.”  
  
  
Fortunately for Coventry City, Kesler-Hayden’s start to life under head coach Frank Lampard has set the right tone on the pitch.  
  
A pre-season camp in Portugal was physically tough — “one of the hardest I’ve had” — but enabled Kesler-Hayden to gel with his colleague as, for the first time, he finds permanent residency away from Aston Villa.  
  
Following five loans and interest from several clubs in the second-tier Championship, including Coventry, enamoured by his successful spell in that division with Preston North End last season, the 22-year-old decided to make the short move to Villa’s Midlands neighbours.  
  
“It’s been perfect,” he says. “The deal happened quickly, but I did come in for analysis meetings about where I’d fit tactically. The manager (Chelsea great and England caps centurion Lampard) showed clips of me and his team. He said my style would fit perfectly with how he wanted to play. I love playing in a possession-based team, so that was a big draw. I knew from the first time I spoke to the gaffer that it was the club I wanted to join.”  
  
Kesler-Hayden joined Coventry at the end of June [for a fee of £5million ($6.7m)](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6462407/2025/06/30/aston-villa-transfers-kaine-kesler-hayden-coventry/).  
  
The former England Under-20 international wanted his future resolved early this summer. Loans to opposite ends of the country — from Plymouth Argyle in the far southwest to Preston in the northwest, with spells at Milton Keynes Dons, Swindon Town and Huddersfield Town in between — while at Villa meant Kesler-Hayden was ready for a less nomadic existence. His next move had to feel more long-lasting.  
  
He was living in Salford, just outside Manchester, while on loan at nearby Preston but bought a house last year close to where he grew up in the Birmingham district of Solihull. He is a Midlands boy with a gentle Brummie accent and is a product of Villa’s academy, [captaining their under-18s to FA Youth Cup final victory in 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2610557/2021/05/25/how-aston-villa-built-a-youth-team-to-win-it-all/).

“Going to Coventry and living nearby was a massive bonus,” he says. “But there are also differences between a manager who has experienced the game and one who hasn’t. When I walked back to the car after meeting Frank, I said to my agent, ‘I really like him’.  
  
“How he was as a person and how he spoke to me — he was a massive reason I came.”  
As a boyhood Villa supporter and a player at the club since he was eight years old, a Premier League debut seemed aspirational, though not outlandish, for Kesler-Hayden. It seemed within touching distance when he made his senior debut [in the Covid-19-affected FA Cup fixture against Liverpool in January 2021](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4225648/2021/01/07/liverpool-expect-aston-villa-fa-cup-clash-to-go-ahead-despite-covid-19-outbreak/).  
  
  
Over the next three years, Kesler-Hayden would remain in a cycle of returning to Villa from one of his many loans for pre-season [before being sent back out on loan or lingering around the first-team squad](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3993923/2022/12/15/aston-villa-loans-kesler-hayden-archer/), without ever playing in the Premier League.  
  
So when the moment finally arrived, in March last year, as a late substitute in the 2-0 home victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers, it would not be overly cliched to describe it as Kesler-Hayden realising a dream.  
  
The moments of pride did not detract from his acceptance that he was unlikely to ever establish himself at Villa. He signed a contract extension after that 2023-24 season, but only to protect his market value, ensuring he did not enter the final 12 months of his prior deal.  
  
“Leaving was difficult, because I’d been there for 14 years,” he admits. “I had a chat about this summer with (sporting director) Monchi and (director of football operations) Damian Vidagany when I signed my new deal and then midway through last season. They were really nice about me leaving and were happy for me to speak to other teams.  
[Emery, Vidagany and Monchi: Inside Aston Villa’s power triangle](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6388016/2025/06/05/emery-vidagany-and-monchi-inside-aston-villas-power-triangle/)  
“They (Villa) are on an upward trajectory and it’s tough competition. I would have wanted the opportunity, but my pathway wasn’t clear there.”  
  
Kesler-Hayden spent six intense months working under manager Unai Emery after returning to Villa in January 2024 from his loan to Plymouth, then in the Championship. The academy graduate had opted to stay with his parent club until the end of that season, rejecting offers from top-end League One sides, and was justified with that Premier League debut two months later.  
  
“Emery is one of the best managers I’ve ever seen,” he says. “There were massive amounts of detail, [and analysis meetings that lasted two hours-plus](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5865976/2025/03/03/unai-emery-aston-villa-analysis-sessions/). The first one, I struggled with… there were a few coffees! But going into games, there were no questions to ask — you knew everything about the opposition.”

Looking back, half a year with Emery laid the foundations for a coming-of-age period at Preston when he was sent there on loan last August.  
  
“Those six months were good for my development,” Kesler-Hayden says. “Leon Bailey and Morgan Rogers — you are training with top players. I improved, it filled me with confidence that I could be an established Championship player on my next loan.”  
  
  
The year at Preston hardened Kesler-Hayden’s mentality and inspired a new level of performance, as he started all of their Championship fixtures from October until the end of the season. He became more tactically erudite and consistent displays followed, leading to Kesler-Hayden sweeping up the individual prizes at Preston’s annual awards.  
  
“We would love to keep him, but maybe we have done too good a job with him,” [Preston’s manager, Paul Heckingbottom, told *The Athletic* in March](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6234908/2025/03/29/kaine-kesler-hayden-aston-villa-preston-loan/).  
  
“At previous loans, I had not completed the season,” says Kesler-Hayden. “I was always coming back in January, either staying at Villa or going on another loan, which didn’t allow me to settle.  
  
“Positionally, I became much better at Preston. I was playing centre-half, both sides of full-back and wing-back, even winger — I was all over the place, and that allowed me to see the game from different places. Now, when I play right-back or centre-back, I understand what my player in front or the player in the opposite position needs from me.”

Even at 22, Kesler-Hayden is aware of the considerable bank of experience he has amassed. He knows exactly how many senior games he has played (136) and is striving to reach more landmarks.  
  
This chimes with his personality off the field: he is viewed as a conscientious, serious worker who enjoys scrutinising his own game. Match footage has played a crucial role in his development, with Kesler-Hayden scouring clips for specific details, such as how he reacts to turnovers in possession or when he does not move into a covering position quickly enough.  
  
While at Preston, he [regularly discussed his performances with Villa’s loan manager, Tony Carss](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6355616/2025/06/16/villa-josh-feeney-sil-swinkels-league-one/).  
  
  
“We spoke every week regarding how I played,” Kesler-Hayden says. “I respect him for that — he gave me honest opinions on my matches. Honesty is the best policy: you don’t want someone to tell you you’re doing well when you’re not. He came to a lot of the games, which was massive. It showed he cared.  
  
“We would use (analysis website) Wyscout, and Tony would make clips, annotating them with comments where I could see what I did right or wrong in an exact moment. The comments would be mostly questions to ask myself, not necessarily answers.”  
[https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3507930/2022/08/31/premier-league-efl-loan-market/](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3507930/2022/08/31/premier-league-efl-loan-market/)  
Carss offered a point of connection to Villa, but Kesler-Hayden considered himself a Preston player. This crystallised when the teams were drawn to face each other in the FA Cup quarter-finals, with Kesler-Hayden ineligible to play against his parent club.  
  
“I was gutted,” he says. “I was sitting in front of the TV, watching the draw. I messaged someone at Preston and said, ‘I can definitely play, can’t I?’. They said no. I couldn’t believe it.  
  
“It was weird. [I wanted Preston to win, so I could play at Wembley](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6234908/2025/03/29/kaine-kesler-hayden-aston-villa-preston-loan/) (in the semi-finals) but my friends from Villa were playing and I was chatting to them before the game, so it was bittersweet.”  
  
Kesler-Hayden will always feel affection for Villa — he’s spent more than half his life with them, after all — yet he knew he needed stability, and Coventry are providing that.  
  
After making the play-offs last season and losing to eventually-promoted Sunderland in a semi-final that went to extra time, Lampard’s side are considered among the contenders to win a Premier League place in the campaign that kicks off at home against Hull City on Saturday. So, for Kesler-Hayden, this move marks the next step up the ladder.  
  
Like his singing, a polite reluctance appears when asked about personal goals for the campaign ahead. Nonetheless, Kesler-Hayden is confident the time will come when he is back in the top flight.  
  
“I can do a lot at Coventry and get where we want to get to, which is the Premier League,” he says. “It’s just about getting over that edge.”",7,1754553396.0,ccfc,0,1.0,False

But this habit has trapped us in an unexpected dilemma. Take last week’s Kyoto Arashiyama Bamboo Grove vlog: I spent weeks planning it, only to have the comments section explode because a kimono-clad grandma flashed across the edge of the frame. “Who’s the beauty in the kimono? Link to her outfit!” “Is this a sponsored trip? Even the bystanders look fake!” Then there was the time I filmed my family’s BBQ—my cousin’s Corgi trotted into frame, chomping on a bone. A pet influencer dug up his breed, and suddenly I was getting DMs: “Can I borrow the pup for a sponsored post?” These seemingly harmless details are like a Sword of Damocles hanging over creators’ heads—one wrong move, and you’re facing privacy backlash or even legal trouble. That is, until I stumbled on a fellow creator’s secret weapon late one night: an AI tool that automatically blurs sensitive elements in your footage. Finally, my months-long “cringe crisis” started to turn around.  
At first, I dismissed **Wumask** as “just another blurring app.” Let’s be real—we’re all sick of similar tools. Some make you manually smear mosaic like you’re patching a shirt; others use robotic blurring that turns your video into abstract art. But when I imported my footage, the progress bar revealed something revolutionary: This AI isn’t just slapping a blur over the screen. It’s weaving an invisible privacy net. Take that elderly woman with a baguette under the Eiffel Tower: Her face softened into a misty glow, but the crunch of her bread and the flutter of cherry blossom petals stayed crisp. Or the food delivery rider in Times Square: His coffee cup blurred into a swirl of color, but the neon sign on its side popped with artistic flair. The best part? When editing out my Corgi’s cameo, the tool knew to keep his signature head tilt (because that’s the cute stuff) while turning a stray calico into a fluffy blur.  
This magic comes from 18 months of R&D. The team built a proprietary blurring algorithm that ditches traditional rectangular mosaics. Instead, it dynamically adjusts blur intensity—so a runner’s leg muscles still convey athleticism, and a dancer’s twirling skirt becomes flowing color poetry. Even better: Its “Privacy Compliance Radar” automatically scans for kid faces, sensitive logos, and license plates. No more sweating over accidental infringements.  
I tested it on my latest New York street food series, and the results blew me away. What used to take two hours manually blurring 200+ bystanders? Now, hit “AI Auto-Blur,” and it’s done in five minutes. The bride trying on a wedding dress in the storefront? Softened to a dreamy silhouette, but her lace details stayed sharp. The street performer’s over-the-top expressions? Blurred into colorful motion, yet his instrument’s texture and playing posture still oozed charisma. After posting, the comments flipped: “Is that cinematic VFX?!” “Finally, a tool that protects privacy without ruining the shot!” One veteran editor even DM’d me: “The coffee cup in the delivery rider’s hand—blurring it made it the focal point. That’s genius creative privacy.”

1mjtsq1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjtsq1,Shoutout to Sheraton Salta,"Just finished a short stay at the Sheraton Salta and I wanted to write a small review (I was overly optimistic when I wrote this) and give a big shoutout to the staff. For some context, this property is the only Marriott in Salta, Argentina, and there are also no Hiltons or Hyatts nearby, also I'm a Platinum Elite.

Right off the bat, I was informed via that app that my room was ready at around 1:00 pm, way earlier than I expected. My room was quietly upgraded to the top floor with an amazing view over the city (not a suite, but I don't believe this property has very many). During check-in, I informed the receptionist that we'd be leaving at around 3:30 am as we had a very early flight the next morning. He then reserved a taxi for us and offered to have some tea and coffee ready for us in the morning!

The hotel has a very interesting design, it's located on a hill and it's sort of one big atrium with lots of windows and glass elevators that look out over the city. The rooms are a bit dated, but everything works great and was clean. The water pressure in the shower was also amazing. Right after we entered the room I was given a thank you note for my status and a box with some pastries stuffed with dulce de lece.

The club lounge is pretty standard, with some tea, some pastries (alfajores), and most importantly, a rooftop patio overlooking the city (picture 1). We were also given two vouchers for tea or coffee at the bar (a sort of light merienda) which also included a couple small pastries. We also decided to have dinner at the bar so we could get to sleep nice and early. The dinner was honestly one of the best ones I've had in a hotel restaurant, and very well priced for the quantity and quality of food (picture 2, which was three fillets of Pacu for about 20,000 ARS).

After dinner and a wonderful sleep, we headed down to the reception around 3 where the receptionist greeted me by name and said he had a full breakfast ready for us to either eat in or take-out (picture 3). That was way beyond what I expected at 3 am and was exactly what we needed to return us to the land of the living after such an early morning. The receptionist even brought our bags over to the taxi (who arrived early) while we were finishing breakfast!

The room was buzzing with jokes and chatter, and coffee cups and snacks were spread around the table. Nobody reacted as Adam entered and sat down. He poured himself a cup of coffee and grabbed a Tufon's chocolate chip cookie. Adam had no idea how those dogs had managed to improve on it, but it was addictive.  He pressed the scanner, and security scanned the room. Nothing was found, and the Aga, the maid droid, went to the wall and waited. The meeting was starting.

“So, are we ready? Or?” Adam asked, and they looked at him. Knug started as he always did. After going over the financial status, Jork asked for a bigger budget for something. After half an hour of those two arguing, the real meeting could start.

“Now that’s over, and Jork got his funds for a new spaceport, we can continue. I’m surprised you gave up so fast today.” Adam said, and Knug just shrugged.

“I do want to see if that internal gate project of his will work. And I always set aside some money for those crazy ideas of his.”

“I don’t have crazy ideas!” Jork said, and they all looked at him.

“Planet-building nanotech?” Arus said, and Jork shrouded.

“A work in progress. Give me some time to work out the kinks. Besides, it's your wife's idea.”

Monori just grinned as Arus just shook his head.

“Okay, besides the regulars, we have three matters to deal with: Xanadu, Kun-Nar, and Mugga.  Let's start with the idiots first. How can we get rid of them? I have endured them for ten years, and as you know, last year they tried to reach out to Evelyn, and this year they sent the kids ‘gifts’ again. On top of that, they are playing safe haven for Kun-Nar’s fanatics and spreading his bullshit.  So how do I get rid of them?” He looked at Sig-San. “without killing them.”

“As I told you, I can easily arrange for their backers to see them as traitors. That would solve the problem.” Sig-San replied, and Adam smiled.

“And they will kill them.  I want them to live knowing they failed, or if they die, I don’t want to be involved in it at all. So no, do not arrange them to die. Find a way to have them sent away, lose their position. Can't we just buy up the damn colony? We've done that before.” Adam said.

“They refuse to sell,” Knug replied.

“Even their backers, still?” Vorts asked, confused.

“They know what you're worth and how much you want to get rid of them. They are hoping you will raise the price.” Knug replied.

“How much are they asking?” Roks asked.

“They are asking in the trillions. It’s ridiculous.” He replied them.

“Earth or galactic?” Arus asked.

“Galactic,” Knug replied, and Adam chuckled at the insanity.

“And we can't buy up the damn companies either.  Okay Sig-San? I want you to go over those companies again. See if you can't find a way to take them down, work with Knugs bankers, and go the financial route. Hopefully, they messed up and the IRS will take them down.” Adam finally suggested.

Sig-San sighed. “Again? Sure, we can give it a try. I would rather go over who they are harboring. We could go the federation route again.”

“Sure, if you want to. Cast a wide net.”  Adam replied.

“We need to stop those broadcasts as well,” Adam said, “The Federation won't do anything as long as those attacks only affect our colonies.”

“Just take the damn throne, and you can do as you please. They are holding this against you.” Roks said, and Adam looked at him.

“I know they try to. Hell, they had one of those stupid votes last week, and I went up on the polls,” Adam said and rubbed his temple. “Why the hell are they doing it?  Don’t answer it.”

Adam took a deep breath.

“So, work on the government and get them on our side to deem Kun-Nar’s fanatics a terrorist group, federation-wide. I’m tired of this game. And where is that old bastard?”

“He was last seen on Cyros, holding a speech and riling up his followers. He is claiming some of your achievements as his. He is now saying defeating the Gavion pirate-slave ring was his deed. And he is claiming you stole his crusades against the flesh-droids.” Sig-San said.

“Oh, how do you feel about that, Roks?” Adam said with a slight smirk.

“That we need to release the videos of our joint strike force? God damn it. That's so easy to prove.  We even worked with the government on that.” Roks said, frustrated. “Stolen valor, as you humans say.”

“I can use that against him. Stolen valor. Great slogan.” Arus said, and Adam wondered why he hadn’t thought about it before.

“Good, spread it around, have Roks on some talk shows to explain the meaning behind it, and use the Gavin pirates as an example. Use some human vets as well.” Adam said as Arus made some notes.

“Telling me how to do my job now?” He said with a smile.

“Suggestions, now Mugga, how is it going?”

“We won sixty new cases now, that win that Fandio corp got with them opened the flood gates. The remaining cases are going to be steamrolled through now. We are making sure the other cases get the intel. Took some time, but we finally wore them down.” Min-Na replied.

“And the stocks?” Adam asked.

“Dropping, but they are trying to use all the tricks in the book. We are buying thought. If we can nail one more big thing on them, then they will probably just agree to sell.” Knug said.

“On more? This is not enough?” Adam was getting frustrated, “Why are they still around?”

“We are bleeding them out, but at this rate, it will still take years, one big scandal would tip them over.  We should focus on that, we know they worked with Kun-Nar. We can use that.”  Knug said.

“Used to, but they claim they broke away when he became fanatic. We even know they work with Xanadu, but we can prove it to be more than regular business.” Sig-San replied.

“Well, we can just hope somebody slips up. That takes care of those matters,” Adam said as he put up the request from the Gwina colony near the Argus system.

“This Scisya colony is called Gwina, and as you know, sought to join our little club. Anything you want to say about it before we vote?” Adam asked, and nobody spoke up.

“Okay, you vote, I abstain. Vote now… And you idiots approved…” Adam said as they all quickly approved, they all grinned. It had been like this since the last ten colonies had joined.

“Then let's continue. Hara, what's the status?”

“Nothing much, no major medical disasters, there is some Scisya plague we are working on again. I had to fire a Wossir doctor for ethical experiments. Sig-San, you need to keep an eye on him. He found the old Dunshin text about how to mutate species into new kinds and wanted to try. He ranted about making the ultimate species. He even spoke about Galios being that new species. He is currently back at his home world, probably setting up a lab. Oh, and I almost forgot. That McGuinness in the pharmacy department is over ecstatic because I showed him how to make the axido medicine human-friendly. He says it will be a ‘best-seller’ and that I'll get something called the Nobel Prize for it.” Hara said while nibbling on a haran meat cookie.

“That’s Dr. Hiruld, right? I’m on it. We already had him on our radar.. That’s the right word right?” Sig-San looked at Adam, who was trying to comprehend what had happened.

“Yeah on your radar… You cracked axido? That’s the life extension axido we are talking about?” Adam looked at her, surprised.

“Yes, is that a big deal?” She looked surprised at her, and Adam laughed.

“Big deal? Humanity has tried to crack that one since its discovery. How effective?”

“Completely, it's one-time use, but triple your lifespan. You're seriously saying you guys didn’t? You should have told me earlier. I could have done this years ago.” She said with a smile.

“Eh, I didn’t know that was an option. You're going to be swapped by requests now.  Did you patent it?”

“Yeah, she did.” Knug said, “I was wondering why the pharmacy department's stock was rising. I was going to ask you about that.”

“Does that mean I get a bonus?” Hara joked, and Adam groaned.

“What do you want?”

“Ten days’ vacation for me and Vorts and babysitters for the kids.”

“Done, our house is chaotic enough, we can spend those days in Sistun.” Adam replied, and Haran and Vorts grinned.

“He doesn’t know what he is getting himself into.” She said to her husband, who laughed.

“And you? Anything I need to know?” Adam asked Vorts.

“Oxygen level is higher, the shield is now at 8,2 kilometers above the surface.  On Hundra, we managed to seed another island successfully, so they can finish the work without me. That crazy guy on Haldan got his mammoth and saber-tooth tigers, but I put them on the northern continent. I got tired of his requests. Kingdom-wide, there are 478 different projects all in green. Oh, and I brewed a new coffee bean. It will be interesting, I’ll bring some samples next month.” Vorts said as he gently squeezed Hara’s hand, and everybody looked at them.

“You're pregnant!”  Monori burst out, and Hara just smiled.

“That explains the need for a vacation,” Adam said as they got their congratulations from their friends.

“Anything else I need to know?” Adam said, looking around. “No?”

They looked at Jork, who shook his head. “We can deal with my stuff privately.”

Everybody knew what it meant, and they looked at Sig-San, who simply said, “The same.”

Then Adam looked at Monori, “Not much, just building libraries and schools on the new colonies. I got a few requests from off-worlds as well. You will have them on your desk. Sig-San has already vetted them.”

“Okay then, if there is nothing else?  Good.  The kids have demanded some daddy time.” Adam got up, and they chuckled.

“You don’t know how to be a boss, and have no clue how to be a king, but a Dad you get,” Hara said.

1mjtodj,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1mjtodj/fussing_in_the_morning/,Fussing in the morning,"Hi all,

My partner and I have a 6-month old pug, who is an absolute joy, but we’re struggling a bit with her morning routine. She sleeps downstairs in her crate and doesn’t fuss at all during the night, but starts to cry and yelp as soon as she hears us waking up. It means we can’t shower or get dressed on a morning without her singing the song of her people. We’ve tried to ignore as best we can, but her voice is really shrill and hearing her is quite distressing, even though we know she’s fine and safe in her bed. 

When we do go down to her, we try not to fuss her too much in case we reinforce the crying, and will open the curtains, put some coffee and toast on before we get her out of bed (for context, we have an open-plan ground floor so she can see and hear us moving around) and she is quiet during this time. 

When she gets out of bed, she’s excited to see us and goes straight out to toilet. Sometimes, she’ll go outside and start to bark for a moment or two when she realises she’s on her own again, and then remembers that she needs to pee and runs off to do so.

We’re looking for advice and maybe some reassurance. We try to keep fuss to a minimum with her so as not to reinforce the crying and yelping on a morning. I’m not sure whether this is part of puppyhood/adolescence and will ease over time - our last pug was a 6-8 year old foster and he slept in ‘til noon - so should we just persevere? Or does this behaviour need a different approach?

We’re working on separation anxiety with her, she’ll fuss if we’re in the house but not with her, but will happily go to my parents’ house and doggy day care without a giving us a backward glance! We’ve also left her at home with an enrichment toy if we’ve had to dash to the shop - no more than 20 mins - and she’s been fine. 

We’d like some advice on whether this behaviour is a training issue on our part that we need to address, or whether she’ll grow out of this behaviour as she matures. Obviously we don’t want to wait and see whether she grows out of it in case she doesn’t and the behaviour becomes ingrained, so we’d love to hear if anyone had any similar issues and what worked for you!

1mjtm4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartAttack/comments/1mjtm4s/18_months_on/,18 months on,"Hi, Im from the UK. 

I thought id share my story.  I'm a male, never drank above allowed units ( UK), only ate takeaways on a Friday, otherwise diet consisted of meat once a week, fish once a week, the rest veggies,pulses. Used to be a smoker but quit 15 years ago. Age at time of HA 53. Excerised 4 to 5 times a week.

Roll back to the end of 2023, a totally normal day. A bit tired from previous day due to cleaning up garden readying for winter and a good gym session but other then that felt great.

Went to work, then around 11am felt a bit light headed, slightly out of breath. No chest pains, no other symptoms, continued to work but my boss told me I didn't look right and should phone 111 or 999. Very reluctantly I did . 

I explained to the nurse how I was feeling and she said 'I think your having a heart attack ' I remember laughing and saying not a chance whilst drinking my coffee. She said she going to call an ambulance, I said no as ambulances should be used for people with serious symptoms. I drove to the hospital.

I waited for 3 hours to be seen, at which point I felt a very mild discomfort in my chest and by sheer fluke it was my turn to be seen by the Dr. She took one look at me and did an ecg immediately and from there it was like a blur.

I was put on a stretcher, and wheeled into a room with 4 doctors, I was totally confused and got up and asked ' what's going on?"" and that's when they told me I was having a heart attack. 

Bloody hell!! I kept getting up to ask questions as I was in a state of disbelief and I think to calm me down they gave me morphine ( i remember feeling like someone had tucked me up in a warm soft blanket, funny how the brain remembers odd things).

Anyway a stent was placed in my LAD, and it was all over in an hour and I was in the hospital bed.

The following day the cardiologist came in and maybe its DR humour but he congratulated me on surviving the widowmaker. Immediately I googled it and I think that's when the reality of what had happened hit me like a train.

They said I was a rare event(?) and just bad luck ie all the vessels in my heart showed no concerning plaque build up, yet some how I had this heart attack. My cholesterol levels were well below concerning, my blood pressure was OK.

I had a bout of really bad covid a few weeks prior and I've subsequently learnt that covid causes major inflammation in blood vessels that can lead to benign plaque breaking off ( under research by the BHF).

Anyway it took months to recover physically, more months to recover mentally and now im back at the gym, went on my first long haul holiday abroad and aside from the arrhythmia issues I get due to the scarring caused by the heart attack, life (fingers crossed) is moving towards the right direction. 

It a tough journey, loads of ups and downs, you always suffer from anxiety but it reduces but never goes away. Life never seems the same again but you make the best of the new life.

2. Your friend come up with an idea. Then you say: I have the same idea.
3. The doctor has the same viewpoint as his mentor.

In these three scenarios, I should say:

1. Wir lesen das gleiche Buch (oder die gleiche Bücher?).
2. Ich habe die gleiche Idee.
3. Der Doktor hat den derselbe Standpunkt wie sein Mentor.

* ""gleich"" refers to something share the same ISBN, producation batch, brand, type and so on. Like:

>Hey, wir haben das gleiche Handy. (means we have the same phone, like iPhone 16 or what)

But what I got confused is THOUGHTS. Since it can not be given an ID for every thought. So I made my own guess. In #2 example, me and my friend have the same idea, but he comes up that idea himself and I myself, so it should be two same things so ""gleich"". And the doctor probably inherits the idea from his mentor, so it should be one thing so ""dasselb"".

1mjtl15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1mjtl15/theory_alans_writing_overlaps_timelines_and/,"Theory: Alan's writing overlaps timelines and predicts the future, not creates it.","It's complicated, but bear with me here. 

Near the end of Alan Wake II, we learn something very interesting. The Dark Place isn't just a dimension linking itself to this world, it's a dimension linking to the **multiverse**. 

>The Dark Place has many faces, and many names. It is a mirror reflecting all possible realities. The family of Doors have the power to shift between these realities.

The Dark Place is a sort-of ""threshold within a threshold"", a Nexus point leading to all possible realities in the multiverse. Like The Oldest House, but on an infinite scale. And this, I suspect, is the key to understanding how Alan's reality-warping writing actually works. Its not **physically** altering the real world. Rather, Alan's works create a **bridge** to a specific pre-existing timeline which then ""leaks"" into the main universe. Take Logan's death for example. That alternate timeline of her drowning does happen somewhere in the multiverse, *Return* just created a bridge and allowed that event to cross-over with the main reality. 

In-fact, it seems that **ALL** of Alan's works are actually windows into alternate realities that his parautalitarian visions allow him to see. The Dark Place just amplified his abilities and made his works physically able to manifest alternate timelines onto the main reality. The Alex Casey books? They are describing events which actually happened, just not in this ""main"" universe, but due to Alan not being in The Dark Place yet, these do not physically cross-over and serve more like echoes. Kind-of like The Hotline. 

>In one world, there was a writer who wrote a story about a cop. In another world, **the cop was real.** 

Night Springs? Same thing. The TV show actually seems to be a mini-version of the Dark Place, its episodes depicting several vastly alternate timelines, which of course makes perfect sense. It was written by Alan, probably going of his parautalitarian multiverse visions. Instead of Jesse going to the FBC, we have her go to a coffee cult under the name of ""The Sibling"". In *Time Breaker*, the multiverse is outright spelled out for us as the player character Shawn hops between multiple realities, being chased by Warlin Door (or a version of him?) across the endless multiverse. From an arcade game world and a black and white hotel, to a comic world and finally a universe completely made out of words. He constantly meets versions of Jesse along the way. 

But then what about *Departure* in Alan Wake 1 or the Lake House manuscript? Or the story of Control's AWE DLC? These are clearly NOT describing events from some alternate reality. It's the direct future of the **main timeline**, so clearly Alan has the power to change reality **without** crossing-over other timelines. And here is where I point to *Quantum Break.* The legally disconnected (due to Miscrosoft owning the IP), but unofficially connected game in the RCU and heavily referenced/re-imagined in Alan Wake II's Time Breaker DLC. 

The really basic plot follows the main character Jack Joyce trying to stop The End Of Time by getting a device called The Countermeasure in order to seal the fracture that's causing time to break down. This game clearly takes place in an alternate reality from the main Alan Wake/Control universe. There's a version of Jesse called Beth, The Countermeasure is clearly an equivalent to Hedron, there's a version of Mr. Door called Martin Hatch serving as the (hidden) main antagonist of the game and instead of the FBC, we have The Bureau of Altered World Events. Oh and Alan Wake is an in-universe game here. 

But the most important thing Quantum Break introduces is the fact that the universe is **pre-determined** and the future cannot be altered in any way. The main characters try to use a time machine to change the past and stop The Fracture prematurely, but it always just leads to those necessary events occurring in the first place. A closed loop.

And this actually lines up with a lot of what we see in Alan Wake and Control. Alan gets visions of being trapped in The Dark Place before even arriving in Bright Falls, Saga's summoning ritual in the future leads to Alan/Scratch escaping from Cauldron Lake three days prior, same characters constantly re-appear across the multiverse etc. The RCU seems to function on the principle that everything is pre-determined. The same thing that we see in Quantum Break. 

Alan Wake's writing like *Departure, Initiation* or The Lake House manuscript is not **altering** reality, it's **describing/documenting** the future that will happen no matter what, a literal timeline blueprint. The only one who knows that this is the case is Mr. Door. 

>Warlin Door walked across the rain slick tiles of Caldera Street Plaza. The rain did not seem to touch him. He sensed his steps were being **observed**. **Documented** into the story. He allowed it. This one time. 

Alan's story in the AWE DLC didn't alter reality, it simply described events that already happened/will happen. A bridge by which Alan can learn about the FBC in order to write them into Return, which leads to Jesse appearing in the Dark Place briefly through a television (mirroring the scene in AWE from Alan's perspective) therefore leading to him learning about the FBC and the loop maintaining itself since time doesn't work the same way in The Dark Place. The one thing that Alan probably actually ""altered"" was changing the future to accommodate narrative tropes like The Clicker (serving as an in-universe macguffin) that was already written by Zane anyway. 

This also explains why characters sometimes do things that aren't part of Alan's story at all, like Sarah alerting the FBC to an AWE in Alan Wake 1. The future determined the story, not the other way around. 

In a nutshell, Alan's writing overlaps alternate timelines with the main one and his manuscripts **document/predict** the future rather than alter reality. 

At least that's my interpretation anyway. ",3,1754551641.0,AlanWake,2,0.8,False

1mjtj6s,https://i.redd.it/rqmdcjn5ujhf1.jpeg,Why Crays Circle Chooses Wi‑Fi Aware — and Bluetooth Only as a Fallback,"**A New Era of Device Freedom**

In the summer of 2025, Apple quietly announced that iOS 26 would add full support for Wi‑Fi Aware, the industry-standard successor to its proprietary AirDrop technology. This decision wasn’t entirely voluntary. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) required Apple to open its ecosystem and support third-party alternatives to AirDrop and AirPlay by the end of the year. As a result, Apple introduced a global Wi‑Fi Aware framework that allows apps to create peer-to-peer connections over Wi‑Fi — without relying on internet access.

For Crays Circle, this announcement marked a major turning point. From the beginning, our mission has been to create an offline-first, decentralized social layer. Wi‑Fi Aware provides the missing infrastructure to make this vision viable.

Jack Dorsey’s BitChat already demonstrated that Bluetooth mesh communication can work in a peer-to-peer setting. But its practical limitations — including low bandwidth, short range, and a lack of built-in identity — restricted its potential. Wi‑Fi Aware offers a different paradigm. With its ability to use low-energy BLE signals for discovery and then transition to high-speed Wi‑Fi channels, it enables fast file transfers, live audio and video streaming, real-time collaboration, and indoor positioning — all without the need for internet or routers. Privacy is preserved through rotating identifiers and precise distance measurement, allowing users to connect meaningfully without giving up control over their data.

**Part of the Open Source Community — and Beyond**

We deeply respect what BitChat has achieved. It brought renewed attention to the promise of offline-first communication. The system connects nearby phones through Bluetooth mesh and uses the Noise protocol to encrypt messages and strip metadata, all while functioning within a limited radius. But Bluetooth’s technical constraints and lack of built-in identity management have shown us that it’s not enough.

That’s why Crays Circle goes further. We are contributors to the BitChat open-source ecosystem, but we’ve also developed our own architecture: the Decentralized Node Communication (DNC) Protocol. This stack is built for scale and reliability, forming self-healing mesh networks that don’t rely on the internet, mobile towers, or centralized infrastructure. By bridging multiple radio technologies — including Wi‑Fi Aware, Bluetooth LE, and LoRa — DNC ensures automatic discovery and connection between devices. This makes Crays Circle functional in dense cities, rural areas, and even across remote terrains.

**The Power of Wi‑Fi Aware**

What makes Wi‑Fi Aware essential is its technical leap forward. It enables devices to establish connections over long distances — often exceeding 100 meters — and sustain high-throughput data streams. Communication begins with a low-energy BLE ping, but then rapidly switches to a 5 or 6 GHz Wi‑Fi channel, allowing fast transmission of files, media, and real-time data. The protocol's support for centimeter-level distance measurement and rotating identifiers also enables new forms of private, location-based interaction.

With iOS 26, these features are finally available across both Apple and Android devices. This cross-platform compatibility brings us closer to our goal of truly decentralized, open, and device-independent communication. Whether you're at a festival, a co-working space, or traveling abroad, you’ll be able to engage in direct communication with people nearby. In situations where Wi‑Fi Aware isn’t supported — such as on older phones — our protocol automatically falls back to Bluetooth LE. The transition is seamless, and while Bluetooth continues to serve short-range, low-data use cases, Wi‑Fi Aware becomes the standard for anything demanding speed, distance, or precision.

**Believing in Crays Super Nodes**

A global mesh network can’t rely solely on smartphones. That’s why we’ve built Crays Super Nodes — compact, open hardware units that form the backbone of our infrastructure. Each node is equipped with a powerful processor, ample memory, and both Wi‑Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5 radios. They’re capable of syncing with leading L1 and L2 blockchains, serving as anchors for peer discovery, data caching, and transaction processing.

Super Nodes don’t just enhance connectivity — they extend utility. They broadcast Wi‑Fi Aware beacons, relay messages between users, cache identity profiles and mini-apps, and allow offline actions to be reconciled on-chain once internet access is restored. These nodes are strategically placed in venues that reflect our target community and use cases. You’ll find them embedded in rooftop lounges, boutique hotels, beachfront resorts, cruise ships, airport terminals, and even entire city districts or smart urban zones.

These aren’t just places to pass through — they’re environments where people live, work, and build community. Over time, we’ll expand this network to include cafés, co-working spaces, and private homes, turning every Crays-powered venue into a resilient and intelligent mesh zone.

**Lifestyle Venues and Mesh Clusters**

Every venue that integrates a Crays Super Node becomes part of a local mesh cluster. These clusters allow peer-to-peer communication within and around the building, connecting guests, residents, and staff without depending on the internet. As more of these clusters emerge, they begin to interconnect into regional webs.

This is where our integration with Nostr and the DNC protocol comes in. Together, they allow these regional webs to form a cohesive, global network. Content, conversations, and transactions can move from local to global whenever connectivity permits — but without losing their offline-first logic or peer-controlled ownership.

This is our approach to overcoming the limitations of the centralized platform era. Rather than abandon the physical world, we’re embedding the next-generation internet into it — starting with places people already love to be.

**From Messenger to Social Platform**

Crays Circle isn’t just a tool for messaging. It’s a new kind of social platform that encourages real-world, meaningful connections. Our matching engine combines personality models like MBTI and the Big Five with user-defined intentions such as networking, socializing, or dating. Instead of swiping through photos or profiles, users share their interests, moods, and context — all while keeping their data entirely on their own device.

At participating venues, users can unlock additional features like token-gated experiences or make offline payments using Crays Coin. This creates entirely new value models for physical businesses, while keeping users in control of their personal and financial data.

We also support Nostr, the open protocol for decentralized microblogging. Each user’s identity is cryptographic and interoperable across both DNC and Nostr. Our Super Nodes can act as local Nostr relays, allowing users to post, comment, or share content offline, and sync with the global network later. This architecture blends reach with sovereignty, giving people both privacy and voice.

**Looking Ahead**

The EU’s push for digital openness, Apple’s long-overdue embrace of interoperable frameworks, and the broader shift toward decentralization have created the perfect environment for Crays Circle to thrive. People are fed up with centralized systems that track, manipulate, and monetize their attention. The market is ready for something different.

By combining a high-performance wireless protocol like Wi‑Fi Aware with a flexible, multi-radio infrastructure like DNC, we’re unlocking powerful, device-level interactions that can operate even when disconnected from the internet. Adding in personality-based matching, decentralized payments, and content-sharing via Nostr, we are building a social fabric that is both deeply human and technologically resilient.

**The Future We’re Building**

Picture this: you’re attending a conference, and you’re guided toward a compatible contact using precise indoor beacons. You hand over a project file — instantly, with no need for Wi‑Fi or a mobile connection. You pay for coffee with a token on your phone. You share the moment in a blog post that syncs to the global network later, once you're back online.

All of this happens under your control, powered by a mesh of smart devices and purpose-built Super Nodes. No surveillance. No central server. No third party deciding what you can say or do.

That’s the future we’re building. And with iOS finally unlocking Wi‑Fi Aware, that future is no longer theoretical — it’s already on the way.",1,1754551450.0,Crays,0,1.0,False

I had a full meniscal tear about a year ago, then a ligament tear I didn't have money to get an MRI for about a month later. Since I didn't have insurance or much money I was on my own recognizance to figure out what to do. I tried and am thankful for the various salves I got off Etsy and so forth over the last year, but the one I made myself has been much more successful so I'm sharing it. 

I had three goals. I wanted to break down scar tissue and what I think may be a baker's cyst, protect the joint and encourage repair, and increase blood flow since joints notoriously have lower circulation. I asked help from Castor oil, Comfrey, and ginger for these tasks. 

I infused the castor with ginger and comfrey, about 2:1 comfrey to ginger via the folk method, covering the dry herbs with about an inch of oil and leaving in the windowsill for a month stirring once a day. At the same time, I made a tincture with the same ingredients and proportions, substituting everclear for castor. 

The root matter was too hard to compress by hand to filter through cheesecloth, but setting the ball on top of a jar the castor oil flowed out eventually, within an hour or so. The tincture I passed through a little aeropress coffee press I wasn't using anymore. (I know, plastic contamination and such, I'm using what I got here!) 

I then added half a cup or so of tincture to the strained infused oil and shook to mix, and poured some into a little roller applicator for ease of use. 

I've been using it for about a month and it's working very well. In particular, I was surprised the  anti-inflammatory support the ginger provided was so strong. I have not noticed any change in the area where I believe I have a bakers cyst, but I expect that to be a slow process if successful. The alcohol in the tincture reduces the viscosity of the castor oil, which is welcome, but it still absorbs slow - it's warm here, and I'm in shorts during the day, so I've been cool with daytime application three times / day and letting the skin breathe awhile over the weekends. 

I don't want to oversell, after all I've only been using it for a month. But it's been a marked improvement, much more than anything else I've used. My hope is it will be a gift to someone else as well. If you use the recipe, I'd appreciate any feedback and constructive criticism. I have some ideas for improvement, adding some support for pain as well for example, but I personally don't have much so it wasn't a concern for me.

Generic brands and bulk buying are on the rise and fewer fancy burritos are being sold; “The ‘what the heck’ purchase is completely gone”

# Quick Summary

* Consumer spending has stagnated as Americans feel strapped amid economic uncertainty and rising prices.
* Worried about the future, consumers are focusing on essentials, forgoing extras, and seeking value to economize.
* Families are trading down to cheaper options, using coupons, and thinking about money like a part-time job.

Americans are back on the hunt for a good deal.

Consumer spending stagnated in the first half of this year, according to federal data issued last week, and the CEOs of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Kroger and Procter & Gamble, among others, are telling investors that their customers are more strapped—or appear to feel that way.

“There’s a lot of consumer anxiety,” said Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez International, which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Cadbury chocolate. Global sales of snacks rose last quarter, but U.S. sales fell a lot.

After spending lavishly through the postpandemic years on everything from home improvement to travel, U.S. consumers find themselves in a summer of economic uncertainty. Beef prices are the highest on record. Daily latte habits now face as much as an additional 50% tariff on coffee. Ford Motor, which makes the most popular vehicle in the U.S.—the F-150 truck—said the Trump administration’s flurry of trade deals have heaped a punishing level of duties on the automaker. It has already raised prices on some cars and trucks to help cover the added costs.

Shoppers, wary about inflation, job expectations and their personal finances, are dialing down their spending to focus on the essentials and forego the extras, executives said. The company behind Invisalign said patients are putting off orthodontic treatment and choosing metal braces over pricier clear alternatives.

P&G, which sells daily-use items such as Tide, Charmin and Pantene, said it is noticing signs of slower spending across essential products, too.

Consumers on both ends of the spectrum—low income and higher income—are reacting to the current volatility they are experiencing, P&G Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said. “We see consumption trends consistently decelerating,” he said.



Even though people still need to do laundry, wash their hair and put diapers on their babies, Americans are using up the goods in their pantry and seeking value by buying in bulk to economize or purchasing smaller packs to spend less. This new behavior is driven by worries about the future, whether over immigration policies, inflation or how tariffs will filter down to consumers, said P&G Chief Executive Jon Moeller.

“People are frustrated, and I would say understandably frustrated, with the lack of certainty,” he told investors.  

Kevin Ervin Kelley, an architect who lives in Los Angeles, says his family has made budget cuts at every level. Gone are the date nights with his wife where they easily spent $150 on dinner. Instead of vacationing at a resort in Hawaii or Mexico, this year they are visiting in-laws with their 7-year-old daughter.

The couple has maintained their incomes, Kelley says, but swings in retirement funds and questions about how tariffs could push up prices have given them pause.

“This time feels different,” he said. “You hunker down and wait it out.” 

The Kelleys still indulge a few of their daughter’s requests, but not all. She recently got a “hard no” to her wish for a new Smurfs backpack, Kelley said. She can keep using her Wicked-themed bag from last year, he added. 

He has also noticed that at children’s birthday parties, there is a new parent suggestion: no gifts necessary.

“The ‘what the heck’ purchase is completely gone,” Kelley says. “We’re only doing things that are known quantities, that will get the job done.”

At Kroger, shoppers are making more trips to the store but putting less in their carts. They are also clipping coupons again and scrimping on discretionary items such as alcohol. The biggest supermarket chain in the U.S. is selling more generic-brand products and offering promotions to entice customers to keep coming back, even as receipts per shopping cart shrink.

“What we’re seeing is different shopping behaviors,” Kroger Chief Executive Ron Sargent said. “Customers are looking for value.”

Families who dine out are trading down for cheaper options, too. Fast-casual chain Olive Garden is getting more business from households with annual incomes over $150,000, while those who earn less than $50,000 are showing up less. Sales at burrito chain Chipotle, where a build-your-own bowl can cost $10 to $16, were down last quarter, while Domino’s Pizza reeled in more diners with its two-for-one deal and other promotions.

Americans now spend nearly four hours a day thinking about money, making it the equivalent of a part-time job, according to a June survey by Empower, the 401(k) giant. More than half of the 2,206 adults surveyed said they are thinking about money more often than they did last year.

Chelsea Hollins, 26 years old, and her boyfriend usually fly off for a vacation each year. This summer, they opted for a cheaper camping trip. Even Walmart’s prices seem to be going up, and Hollins has to stretch her hard-earned dollars as a full-time college student and part-time paid intern at the Detroit Institute of Arts. She goes to multiple stores to find staples, hunting for the lowest prices. Aldi, she says, has the best deals on meat.

She also canceled her DoorDash subscription and downloaded the coupon apps for Dollar General and Walgreens so she can compare promotions.

“I was not doing couponing before,” Hollins says. “I’m getting into it because you have to do that now.”

Amanda Verdino used the Rocket Money app to analyze her recurring subscription costs. The 39-year-old marketing director at employee-benefits company Forma downgraded her Ancestry.com account to save $20 a month, and canceled most of her “Subscribe and Save” orders from Amazon.com once she realized she already had items on that list stockpiled.

“We really looked at what we can trim,” she said. “If you go into our garage, you’ll see a stack of a zillion paper towels and a zillion rolls of toilet paper, and under every sink is at least one or two packs of toothpaste. I thought: Why are we just blindly paying for more of this stuff?”

A May poll of consumer sentiment conducted by consulting firm McKinsey found most people planned to adjust their spending in response to tariffs. Rising prices was the top concern of those surveyed, far outweighing issues such as immigration, international conflict and political polarization.

Kiara Carniewski, 31, is expecting her second child later this month and has worked hard to take her expenses down by a range of 60% to 70%. From her weekly grocery bill to luxury skincare products, she has been ruthless, she said. “If it’s not necessary, it’s no longer purchased.”

A few weeks ago she found herself racked with guilt after splurging on a $5 coffee. That expense is nothing compared to her former guilty pleasure of perusing the aisles at T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods. “Back then, I was like, ‘Life is short. Treat yourself!’ ” she said.

Now, she is keenly aware of how much is on the line for her family’s finances.

“I really believe that the American economy has a massive math problem: Everything is getting more expensive but wages have not.”

# Quick Summary

* Consumer spending has stagnated as Americans feel strapped amid economic uncertainty and rising prices.
* Worried about the future, consumers are focusing on essentials, forgoing extras, and seeking value to economize.
* Families are trading down to cheaper options, using coupons, and thinking about money like a part-time job.

Americans are back on the hunt for a good deal.

Consumer spending stagnated in the first half of this year, according to federal data issued last week, and the CEOs of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Kroger and Procter & Gamble, among others, are telling investors that their customers are more strapped—or appear to feel that way.

“There’s a lot of consumer anxiety,” said Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez International, which makes Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Cadbury chocolate. Global sales of snacks rose last quarter, but U.S. sales fell a lot.

After spending lavishly through the postpandemic years on everything from home improvement to travel, U.S. consumers find themselves in a summer of economic uncertainty. Beef prices are the highest on record. Daily latte habits now face as much as an additional 50% tariff on coffee. Ford Motor, which makes the most popular vehicle in the U.S.—the F-150 truck—said the Trump administration’s flurry of trade deals have heaped a punishing level of duties on the automaker. It has already raised prices on some cars and trucks to help cover the added costs.

Shoppers, wary about inflation, job expectations and their personal finances, are dialing down their spending to focus on the essentials and forego the extras, executives said. The company behind Invisalign said patients are putting off orthodontic treatment and choosing metal braces over pricier clear alternatives.

P&G, which sells daily-use items such as Tide, Charmin and Pantene, said it is noticing signs of slower spending across essential products, too.

1mjt9ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mjt9ra/how_i_cracked_the_product_hunt_code_for_1_product/,How I Cracked the Product Hunt Code: For #1 Product of the Day (Complete Playbook Inside),"**TL;DR: Turned SaaS idea into a Product Hunt winner using a 4-phase system. Sharing the exact playbook that got us 2,847 upvotes and $47K in first-week revenue.**

# The Story Nobody Tells You About Product Hunt

Six months ago, I was just another developer with a half-baked SaaS idea, scrolling through Product Hunt wondering how those #1 products seemed to magically appear with thousands of upvotes.

Fast forward to last month: Our product hit #1 Product of the Day, generated 2,847 upvotes, and brought in $47,000 in the first week.

Here's the brutal truth nobody talks about: **Product Hunt success isn't luck. It's a system.**

And I'm about to give you the exact playbook I used.

# Phase 1: The Foundation (Months 4-6 Before Launch)

**The Mistake I Almost Made:** I was ready to launch after building for 3 months. Thank God I didn't.

Instead, I did something that felt counterintuitive – I stopped coding and started talking to people.

**What I Actually Did:**

* **Found My Perfect Customer:** Spent 2 weeks interviewing 47 potential users. Discovered my real target wasn't ""small businesses"" but specifically ""marketing agencies with 10-50 employees struggling with client onboarding.""
* **Crafted My Hook:** Used this formula that changed everything: ""We help \[marketing agencies\] who struggle with \[chaotic client onboarding\] to achieve \[streamlined 24-hour setup\]. Unlike \[manual spreadsheets\], our solution \[automates the entire workflow\].""
* **The Waitlist Test:** Created a simple Carrd page explaining the concept. Got 312 signups in 2 weeks just from LinkedIn posts. This told me I had something.

**The Lightbulb Moment:** When I shared my half-built prototype with 10 people from my waitlist, 8 of them asked ""When can I pay for this?""

# Phase 2: Building the Hype Machine (Months 1-3 Before Launch)

This is where most people mess up. They think launch day is everything. Wrong.

**My Content Strategy:**

I became obsessed with providing value BEFORE asking for anything. Posted 3-5 pieces of high-value content weekly:

* ""3 Client Onboarding Mistakes That Kill Agencies"" (LinkedIn post: 847 likes)
* ""Why Your Onboarding Process Is Losing You $10K/Month"" (Blog post: 2.3K views)
* Mini case study videos showing before/after client setups

**The Secret Sauce:** Every piece ended with ""P.S. Building something to solve this – join the waitlist if you're interested."" No hard sell. Just value + soft nudge.

**LinkedIn Became My Best Friend:** Started sharing development updates. ""Just finished the automated email sequence feature!"" These posts consistently got 200+ likes and tons of DMs asking about launch date.

**Product Hunt Prep:** Spent 2 weeks perfecting my PH page. One 60-second demo video, 5 compelling screenshots, and a description that focused on the problem, not features.

# Phase 3: Launch Day (The 24 Hours That Changed Everything)

**5 AM Launch Day Strategy:**

Coordinated my ""launch team"" – 23 people from my waitlist, friends, and early supporters. We had a group chat going.

**The Sequence That Worked:**

* **Hour 1:** Launch team hits Product Hunt immediately
* **Hour 2:** Email to my 847 waitlist subscribers: ""WE'RE LIVE ON PRODUCT HUNT!""
* **Hour 3:** LinkedIn post with a compelling hook: ""After 6 months of building, we're finally live. Here's what happened in the first hour..."" (2.1K views, 89 comments)
* **Throughout the day:** Personal DMs to everyone who commented, offering exclusive bonuses

**The Email Series That Converted:**

* **Day 1:** Launch announcement + 50% discount (48-hour limit)
* **Day 2:** FAQ email addressing common concerns from early users
* **Day 3:** ""24 hours left"" email with social proof from first customers
* **Day 4:** ""Final hours"" – short and urgent

**Results:** Ended the day at #2, but the momentum was building.

# Phase 4: The Week That Made It All Worth It

**The Numbers:**

* Product Hunt: #1 Product of the Day (final ranking)
* Website traffic: 14,000 unique visitors (up from 200/day average)
* Email signups: 1,247 new subscribers
* Revenue: $47,000 in first week
* Conversion rate: 8.3% from PH traffic

**What I Learned:**

1. **Early engagement is everything on PH.** Those first 100 upvotes in hour 1 determined the entire trajectory.
2. **LinkedIn was my secret weapon.** That launch day post brought in more qualified leads than any other channel.
3. **The real magic happened in the DMs.** I personally replied to 247 LinkedIn comments and sent follow-up DMs. 31 became customers.
4. **Urgency works (when authentic).** My 48-hour discount created genuine FOMO because people could see the value.

# The Complete System (For Those Who Want to Replicate This)

**Pre-Launch (2-6 months out):** ✓ Define your exact customer (not ""small businesses"") ✓ Build a waitlist with real engagement (not just email collectors) ✓ Create valuable content consistently ✓ Build relationships before you need them

**Launch Prep (2-4 weeks out):** ✓ Perfect your Product Hunt page (video + screenshots + compelling copy) ✓ Assemble your launch team (friends, early users, network) ✓ Plan your email sequence (4 emails over 4 days) ✓ Prepare LinkedIn content in advance

**Launch Day:** ✓ Coordinate early upvotes (first hour is crucial) ✓ Send launch email to waitlist immediately ✓ Post on LinkedIn with engaging hook ✓ Personally engage with every comment and DM interested people ✓ Monitor and respond throughout the day

**Post-Launch (First week):** ✓ Send urgency-based email sequence ✓ Follow up with all new leads in CRM ✓ Analyze what worked for future launches ✓ Start nurturing new subscribers for long-term growth

# The Biggest Mistakes I See (And How to Avoid Them)

**❌ ""Build it and they will come"" mentality** → Start marketing before you finish building

**❌ Trying to appeal to everyone**  
→ Get laser-focused on one specific customer type

**❌ Launching without a network** → Spend months building relationships, not just product features

**❌ Treating launch day as the finish line** → Launch day is day 1 of your marketing, not the end

# Questions I Keep Getting Asked

**Q: ""How much did this cost?""** A: $49 total. Carrd ($19), Mailchimp ($30). Everything else was time and hustle.

**Q: ""How long did the whole process take?""**  
A: 6 months total. 3 months building relationships and content, 3 months perfecting the product and launch strategy.

**Q: ""What if I don't have a network?""** A: I started with 200 LinkedIn connections. Focused on providing value first, asking for nothing. Grew to 1,200+ relevant connections by launch day.

**Q: ""Can this work for B2B SaaS?""** A: This IS B2B SaaS. The principles work for any product, but B2B especially benefits from the relationship-building approach.

# What I'd Do Differently Next Time

1. **Start the waitlist earlier** – I could've had 2,000+ people if I started 6 months out
2. **More video content** – The demo video got 10x more engagement than screenshots
3. **Reach out to micro-influencers** in my space for launch day support
4. **Set up affiliate partnerships** before launch, not after

# The Real Secret Sauce

Here's what nobody tells you: **Product Hunt success is 80% relationships, 20% product.**

The best product doesn't win. The product with the best launch strategy and strongest network wins.

I spent more time coffee chatting with potential customers than I did coding in the final month. That's what made the difference.

# Your Turn

If you're building something or planning a launch, here's my challenge: **Stop building for 1 week and spend that time talking to 10 potential customers.**

Ask them:

* What's their biggest frustration with \[your problem area\]?
* How are they solving it now?
* What would make them switch to a new solution?

Their answers will change your entire approach.

**Drop a comment if you want me to elaborate on any part of this system. Happy to share more specific tactics, templates, or answer questions about your launch.**

**P.S.** \- I'm working on my next launch using this exact playbook. If you want to follow along or get early access to new strategies I'm testing, feel free to connect!

Feeling so much regret for going through with the pregnancy at all.,"I was just diagnosed. Lost it on my OB staff. Completely refused treatment, talking to anyone, or monitoring. I do have my reasons starting with the fact that I hate being pregnant and I was completely fine not having any more kids.I regret not terminating more than anything in the world right now. I already eat pretty healthy. I definitely don't eat enough, but I can't afford to already. It's usually one meal a day, and maybe a snack like an apple or avocado, and a few pieces of cheese. I do have a sugary drink problem as I have about one a day. Coffee, soda, juice, Gatorade, and sweet tea are my only real treat to myself. That paired with the fact that I only really eat about 5-6 of the approved foods just has me crashing out. I can't afford extra food for myself anyway. We have a $100 a week grocery budget for 4 of us including non food items, and my SO doesn't eat fish, pork, or chicken breast. I literally see no way to make it manageable besides to just starve, and be miserable. I know for a fact it would be easier if I just died. (No. I won't talk to a therapist because it's a complete waste of my time. I'm rational and reasonable under most circumstances, and it's only done me more harm than good in the past. I also refuse to take mind altering drugs like an SSRI. That's just not something I'm ever willing to do. I don't want my emotions or my brain chemicals messed with.) I'm also not going to the ER) Meeting a dietician sounds absolutely dreadful on its own because I obsessively researched everything for 20+ hours after finding out so I pretty much know what they're going to tell me. Plus I HATE needles! I can't stress that enough. Poking myself is not even a possibility, and there's nobody here to just do it for me. I really don't think I could even force myself to do it with a bribe (which without sugary beverages idk what I could bribe myself with) I just don't know what to do. All of it is too much, and I'm not seeing any easy solutions that leave me alive and well. I feel like they put a gun to my head and they're begging me to pull the trigger. I don't want more doctors and appointments. I don't even want a baby anymore. I'm just over it. I haven't stopped crying for days. ",2,1754550331.0,GestationalDiabetes,10,0.75,False

Thank you for the responses. Lots of very good points. Going forward, I won't bother asking, and we will just have to decide whether the lack of garden is a deal breaker.)

Me and my partner are looking to buy our first house. We've found a lovely, unique property that we both really like. However, it has no garden at all. It's a listed property that has been split into two. It's has a back door with a small garden outside, but it belongs to next door. They don't have any furniture out there because they also have a terrace/balcony, which seems to be where they sit out.

My question is, would it be inappropriate for me to politely approach them and say that we're thinking of putting in an offer, but we first wanted to know if they'd be willing to share use of part of their outdoor space for an annual fee.

We wouldn't use it for any gatherings, only to sit out with a coffee and occasionally soak up some sun. We also plan on having a child in the next couple of years, so a small outdoor space would be great for them.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

I met her on MySpace (yeah, that long) about 20 years ago. From the beginning we had a pretty great connection and would often talk on the phone for hours, sometimes until the morning. I remember our parents getting upset with us tying up the phone lines to talk all night for free on the house phone. Long story short, we've always been homies and the thought of her being anything more never really crossed my mind.

We've always kept in touch and crossed paths here and there, but nothing ever felt romantic between us. She lived her life, had a few kids, got married and I joined the military and traveled the world. We would keep in contact here and there just to keep the friendship alive. We started picking things up a bit after I left the military and we met up for the first time ever about 10 years ago. Up until that point we'd only ever talked on the phone or texted.

When we first started hanging out in person she was still married, so obviously things were platonic. Despite being friends, we've always had a connection we couldn't explain. There was always tension and flirty energy (at least I thought so).

Fast forward to more recently and she's been divorced from that guy for a few years and even had a few relationships/flings in between. For about the past 2-3 years we've been in each others' lives a lot more, even to the point where I was there to help her through her divorce and all of the drama that it entailed. 

Now to present day. We've always stayed in touch and in the past 2 years I'd say we would call each other about 2-3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. We would always talk for a few hours (kinda like when we were younger) and neither of us would think too far into it. A few months ago I went to visit her and we did a Halloween event that she was really excited for. We went out and had drinks with some of her friends and one of mine and everything was strictly friendly. At least that's what I thought. When I talked to my friend later on he thought we were vibing or at least dating because he said she wouldn't stop staring at me. She's always gravitated towards me physically, even when we were strictly friends. If my friend noticed that she enjoyed being physically close to me then maybe there was something there. I didn't really think anything of it until the next time I visited.

So after the Halloween trip, nothing really changed. We would still call each other maybe 3-4 times a week now, still talking for a few hours each. A couple of months ago I recently went back to visit her again to hit up Galaxy's Edge at Disney World and the new Epic Universe at Universal for my birthday. This is where I felt the shift. For starters, she had planned a surprise little birthday celebration for me with her kids. I had planned on staying at her house and when we got there from the airport, her kids threw glitter on me and sang Happy Birthday when I walked through the door. She had a cake and candles, the whole 9. That really got to me because she didn't have to do any of that, I felt cared about, seen, and appreciated all at once. The trip was amazing and we even brought her kids to some of the parks and they seemed to enjoy having me there. The entire time I was at her house I was fed, taken care of, and truly appreciated. Something in me just flipped, I couldn't believe that somebody would be willing to do all that for me. The chemistry was natural with her and her kids and that really caught me off guard.

After that trip, the contact got more intense. Now we're talking every single day and for HOURS. From the time she gets up for work until she clocks in, and then she'll call me as soon as she's off. Slowly after that trip she would call me from Disney with the kids or while they were out doing things together. Even when we were in contact before, she would often keep her kids at an arms length and I get it. They would know of me but she never made the effort to integrate me into their lives. Not only has she integrated me with her children, she's integrated me with her love life. She'll tell me how annoyed she gets when guys hit on her or try to rush things. She's super honest with me, even with little things like her falling asleep and not being able to call me or when she doesn't call me on her break because she went to go get lunch with a coworker. We've made future plans (like this upcoming Labor Day weekend trip, and even her first international trip) and she'll use language like ""we"" when planning things out. She's even mentioned how ""we could come back and bring the kids"" when I've mentioned places she's gone without me. I've gotten her gifts she's tagged me in and even some she just casually mentioned in conversation and forgot about. I even had coffee delivered to her job one day when she was super stressed out. I'm not trying to quantify anything, but I would've figured she'd get the hint by now.

Things have escalated and I'm just worried I might be reading too much into this. She's mentioned before how she hated when previous best friends would confess feelings for her and make it weird, citing how firmly she believes that men and women can have completely platonic relationships. But at the same time I know she felt the energy shift, otherwise why would things escalate? She'll tell me how cautious she is with involving men with her kids, yet she'll have me on a video call trying to interact with them. She says she'll probably never get married again because no guy will ever be okay with us being as close as we are, and that it's a non-negotiable, yet she'll come up with a hypothetical in which I'm the first person she names that she would get married to just to get back at her ex (I know how this sounds, but I assure you she's just hurt and trying to make him hurt too). It's like I'm the exception but she doesn't want to jinx it.

I know this is all a lot, but I just want to know if I'm going crazy or if there's something to build upon here? I'm terrified to have the ""what are we"" talk but at the same time I don't want to be used for my ""boyfriend energy"" and have my feelings put on hold. Part of me says to trust the process but the other part of me says I should pull back to protect myself.

Okay, let’s get real for a minute. Why are we still leaving money on the table when it comes to our AI-generated content? I mean, we’ve got these incredible tools at our fingertips, yet so many of us are just twiddling our thumbs while the cash flows to someone else. 🤔

**Here’s the thing:** If you don’t jump on the bandwagon now, you might as well start carving “I’m too late” on a gravestone for your side hustle! 

Let’s dive into how we can start monetizing our AI content. It’s easier than you think:

1. **Pick Your Niche**:  
   - Are you a specific audience’s superhero? Focus on that, whether it’s travel, finance, or cat memes (because, obviously, who doesn’t love cats?). 
   - Find *your* voice, and let your passion shine through. 

2. **Know Your Platform**:  
   - Blogs, social media posts, e-books, or courses—what’s your jam?
   - Each platform has its quirks! Use them to your advantage. 

3. **Create and Promote**:  
   - Use AI tools to whip up content like it’s nobody’s business. 
   - And don’t forget to share it. Social media, forums, and even good old-fashioned word-of-mouth can work wonders!

4. **Offer Value**:  
   - Why should anyone care about your content? 
   - Make sure it’s something they need. Tips, tricks, or insights—they should leave feeling smarter (and maybe a little happier).

5. **Get Creative with Monetization**:  
   - Think about membership sites, affiliate marketing, or sponsored posts.  
   - Have you heard of Patreon? It's like a tip jar but for your incredible content! 

But hold up! Let’s sprinkle in a dash of humor here. The other day, I looked at my old blog post and thought, “Wow, I could have funded my coffee addiction with that content!” ☕️ It’s like finding a forgotten ten-dollar bill in your jeans—surprising and oh-so-sweet!

**Now, here’s a little pep talk:** Don’t let the fear of being ""too late"" stop you. Remember when everybody was panicking about how to use social media? Look at them now, with their Insta-fame and TikTok dances! 

So, as you're sipping your morning coffee or scrolling through your feed, ask yourself: Are you ready to stop leaving that sweet, sweet cash on the table? Or are you just waiting for someone else to scoop it up first? The beauty of AI is that it makes it easier than ever to churn out amazing content; now it’s time to make it work for you.

And hey, I’m excited to see what content you guys come up with! Let’s share our journeys and applaud each other’s successes. Who knows, your content might just inspire the next big trend—all thanks to a little AI magic! 🌟",1,1754549780.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1mjt2ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1mjt2ds/got_through_a_long_stressful_adventure_vacation/,"Got through a long, stressful adventure vacation without a single episode. Minor miracle? Or hidden lesson(s)?","I just retuned from a 3 week private and locally guided birding trip through Rwanda and Uganda. I am 61, with paroxysmal afib and a couple of other health conditions. I really wanted to go on this trip, but I have to confess that I was pretty stressed out about it too. Would my body hold up?

I was particularly worried about afib as I had been getting episodes every four to twelve days for at least six months. None of the episodes were severe, and all of them ended in less than six hours and most much earlier than that. But I still had the episodes. And most of them ended because I used my favorite go-to home remedy — exercise.

My episodes always end (sooner or later) with exercise as long as I can get my heart rate high enough.  In order to do this, I usually either hop on my exercise bike or speed walk/run/do high impact calisthenics if the bike is not available.

However, I injured a hamstring last year on a previous vacation  (fell while hiking on Mt. Gede in Indonesia) and had been trying to avoid running/speed walking/high impact calisthenics as I kept reinjuring my hamstring when I used this kind of exercise to reset my heart. So I had been stuck with only the bike (much easier on the hamstring) and even no exercise at all sometimes (when I had a flare). And I knew that I would have zero access to an exercise bike during my entire trip through Rwanda and Uganda (zero fitness clubs in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest or Nyungwe Forest, for example).

So, going into this trip I was super worried about getting an afib episode that I either couldn’t terminate because I wouldn’t be able to get my heart rate high enough or that I wouldn’t terminate through exercise but this exercise would flare my hamstring so that I essentially wouldn’t be able to enjoy or even participate in much of the trip.

I discussed this with my EP ahead of time and, in addition to the 25mg of metoprolol I take every day, he gave me enough Flecainide for either a pill-in-the-pocket approach (which I had already tested and found highly effective) OR a daily dosage if need be (if I got repeated attacks that I couldn’t or didn’t want to terminate through exercise).

Long story short, after managing my afib for 10 years without meds (I wasn’t even taking daily metoprolol (rate control) before last year — before I injured my hamstring,) I was convinced that this trip would be the event that would push me into daily Flecainide, then probably ablation. I felt sad about that prospect, but didn’t want to let my fear of meds/ablation prevent me from traveling.

So what happened on the trip? I didn’t get any afib episodes AT ALL. As I mentioned above, I had been getting the episodes every four to twelve days at home. But then, twenty-two days without a single episode in spite of jet lag, indigestion, long days on trails in high altitudes, and some pretty significant emotional stress (both good and bad).

It feels like a minor miracles, but was it? By the end of the trip, I was thinking that I was doing something different that was really helping me stay in rhythm and started wondering what that was.

My current hypotheses:

1. I started drinking coffee on this trip. I dont drink coffee at all at home. My afib is almost entirely vagal (I get it at night in bed, or when I am relaxing after meals). Maybe all the coffee helped keep me from my typical vagal triggers?
2. I added some hydration powder with magnesium and potassium supplementation into my personal water supply. I always supplement with magnesium and potassium at home, but the difference is that at home the supplementation is more ”spiky” whereas on the trip it was smoother and more spread out through the day — a little bit every single time I took a sip of water.
3. My exercise “program” looked very different. At home, I had shorter periods of more intense exercise. On the trip I had much longer periods of less intense exercise (all-day bird hikes) alternating with lighter, travel days.
4. some combination of the above.
5. Other? Maybe just luck?

In any case, I am planning on experimenting at home by trying to preserve trip conditions as much as possible for the first week, the playing around with these variables to see which was doing the trick.

## Key Features Analysis

the characteristics of a burl wood coffee table vary substantially, influencing both its aesthetic appeal and its functional longevity. Understanding these key features is essential for selecting a table that meets your specific needs and preferences.

**Wood Type and Quality:** The type of wood used for the burl significantly impacts the table's durability and appearance. The burl itself is an abnormal growth on a tree, frequently enough resulting from stress or injury, which creates the swirling, intricate grain patterns that are highly prized.Different wood species, such as walnut, maple, redwood, and oak, offer varying degrees of hardness, color, and grain complexity. High-quality burl wood will be carefully sourced, properly dried, and free from meaningful defects like cracks or rot.

**Size and dimensions:** the size of the coffee table should be proportionate to the dimensions of your living space and the surrounding furniture. A small table might get lost in a large room, while an oversized table could overwhelm a smaller space.Consider the height, width, and length of the table and how it relates to the seating arrangement. Standard coffee table heights typically range from 16 to 20 inches, but this can vary depending on the style and design.

**Base and Support Structure:** The base of the coffee table provides critical support and stability. common base materials include metal, wood, and acrylic. Metal bases can offer a modern, industrial look, while wooden bases complement the natural aesthetic of the burl wood top. The design of the base should also complement the overall style of the table, whether it's a minimalist design or a more ornate and sculptural form. The base must be strong enough to support the weight of the burl wood top and withstand daily use.

**Finish and Sealing:** The finish applied to the burl wood surface not only enhances its natural beauty but also protects it from moisture, scratches, and stains. Common finishes include oil-based, water-based, and lacquer coatings. Oil-based finishes tend to highlight the wood's natural grain and provide a warm, matte sheen. Water-based finishes are more environmentally friendly and offer a durable, clear coat.Lacquer finishes provide a high-gloss sheen and excellent protection. Whichever finish is chosen, it should be applied evenly and professionally to ensure long-lasting beauty and durability.

**Shape and Style:** burl wood coffee tables come in various shapes and styles, from classic rectangular designs to more organic and free-form shapes that showcase the natural contours of the burl. The shape and style should complement your existing decor and reflect your personal taste. Rectangular tables are versatile and work well in most living rooms, while round or oval tables can soften the lines of a more angular space. free-form tables add a unique and artistic touch to any room.

Key features of the burl wood coffee table include:

* Unique grain patterns
* High-quality wood selection
* Durable construction that is built to last
* Protective finish that will guard against natural elements

Ironic, considering that I am reserved by nature and take forever to open up, preferring to be the great observer rather than an active participant. Years of experience have led me to accept that the world will never notice you if you don’t shout, and I never shout, but that inner romantic in me just hope that there will be at least one person who will notice without me asking for it. I am hyper independent and pride myself with it, but hope for someone to be there not to proactively pull me along, but to know that I have a safety net to catch me should I ever fall. I don’t know if this is too much to ask; I have never been good at expressing myself, especially when I need something, as I seem to have everything under control externally, but something small and meaningful like making me coffee before I wake, or noticing the very subtle nuances in my facial expression and asking about it, or even just remembering something about me, will certainly make my day.

The praises I tend to receive revolve around my competency and skillset, and people tend to remember me every time they need something to be planned or executed, but will often be forgotten thereafter. I myself am partly to blame for that, as getting personal with people does not come naturally for me. Even when I care for others, it will tend to be something discreet, like remembering a passing comment and acting on it, choosing gifts that complements their liking, or generally just making things as convenient as possible for them, but fail to verbalise them emphatically. My hope is that someone will reciprocate then again with something small and meaningful.

1mjsv1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/energyfuture/comments/1mjsv1w/carbon_intensity_indicators_from_brain_fog_to/,Carbon Intensity Indicators: From Brain Fog to “Aha!”—Eventually,"Let’s be honest—most people hate this topic. Or if they don’t hate it, they dread it. It’s like trying to decipher a new dialect of math-speak while juggling a coffee in one hand and regulations in the other, with someone yelling “COMPLY NOW” in your ear.

You're not stupid.  
The system is messy. Loud. Cold. Mechanical. Uninviting.

But somewhere in all of that—underneath the spreadsheets, formulas, fuel logs, and bureaucratic whiplash—there’s something oddly simple. Something almost elegant. The **Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)** is, at its core, a glorified ratio. It’s a measure of how much carbon you spit out *per unit of work done*. But trying to make sense of it often feels like solving a Rubik’s cube with oven mitts on.

Let’s pick this apart—not with sterile efficiency, but with the warmth and frustration of someone who’s tried (and failed) to explain this during a coffee-fueled midnight PowerPoint panic session.

# 1. Emission Sources: Volcanos, Ships, and the Guilt Complex

So, my uncle once said, “Why worry about ships when a single volcano can ruin the planet in a weekend?” And for a brief second, I agreed. I mean, think about it—**Mount Pinatubo (1991)**? Boom. Sky turned gray. Temps dropped. People wore sweaters in June.

But here’s the thing. That’s one volcano, one blast. Natural, yes—but irregular and mostly sulfur, not CO₂. Meanwhile, we’re out here flying, shipping, trucking, chugging along—**every day**, every hour. Ships alone? Roughly **1 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year**. Volcanos? Maybe **1/100th** of that. On a good year.

Still—this gets confusing. Where do we draw the line? Do we blame nature, or take responsibility?

**It’s overwhelming because there’s no clear border.** You’re trying to measure your footprint in a world covered in prints.

👉 **Solution? Shrink your zone.** Just focus on what *you* can measure. In shipping or aviation, that means:

* Your fuel consumption
* Your output (cargo moved, passengers carried)
* Your operational scope (you can’t clean the ocean, but you can reduce how dirty your vessel makes it)

**Use the knowns. Ignore the noise.** And ignore your uncle—for now.

# 2. Metrics Mayhem: Wait, What’s Intensity Again?

Ever tried to explain carbon intensity at a party? Don’t. You’ll lose friends.

I once described it as “grams of CO₂ per tonne-kilometre” and watched a grown man slowly back away toward the chips table.

The truth? It **is** complicated because it changes. Airlines talk in grams per *passenger-kilometre*, ships in *tonne-kilometre*, energy plants in *CO₂ per megawatt-hour*. And when you start comparing them—like flights vs. freighters—it’s like comparing apples to metric apples, which are somehow bananas.

But the real problem? You’re not told *which* one to use. You’re just expected to “know.”

👉 **Fix it by picking your lane.**

* In aviation, stick to **RPK** (Revenue Passenger Kilometre).
* In maritime, stick with **AER (Annual Efficiency Ratio)** or **EEDI**.

And then—tattoo it somewhere, mentally or physically. Use that metric every time. Until it burns into your spreadsheet muscle memory.

Because consistency is clarity, and clarity... well, it makes room for creativity.

# 3. Data Headaches: Garbage In, Chaos Out

Oh, the *data*. If CII is the compass, data is your north star—and half the time, it's flickering.

I've seen ships report fuel use in *buckets*. Literal handwritten logs with coffee stains and “estimated” voyage distances. (By the way, if you’re estimating a route you just sailed... we have a problem.)

The truth is, bad data will wreck your score. **Inaccuracy breeds mistrust.** Mistrust becomes fines. Fines become panic.

But it’s not your fault—not entirely. The tools? Inconsistent. The systems? Antiquated. The crew? Overworked and undertrained in climate accounting.

👉 **Here’s a better way:**

* Automate **everything** you can (fuel meters, GPS tracking, log digitization).
* Build a culture around data integrity—not just collection.
* And once a month, go old-school: sit down, review a voyage. Manually. Understand what the numbers are whispering.

They’re not just numbers. They’re stories. One barge told me more about efficiency in one log than five reports ever did.

# 4. Regs That Shift Like Sand

Just when you get a grip on the rules—**boom**, IMO shifts again. EU tweaks MRV. ICAO adds a layer. You blink, and the acronym soup is boiling over.

CII today might not be CII tomorrow. We’re playing climate whack-a-mole. Everyone’s chasing moving targets with outdated arrows.

And—let’s be honest—that breeds inertia. Why spend money on upgrades when the goalpost keeps sliding?

👉 **Strategy? Build a buffer.**  
Have a “regulation radar.” Not an actual one—though if someone builds that, call me.

Assign one person or team to track:

* IMO updates
* EU ETS changes (yes, it includes shipping now)
* ICAO CORSIA compliance

Every quarter, do a check-in. Not a fire drill. Just a pulse check. What’s new? What’s coming?

Adaptation is less painful than rework.

# 5. The Existential Crisis: Why Bother?

Sometimes, late at night, this question creeps in: *Does it even matter?* I mean—volcanoes, China, cows, fast fashion, billionaires flying rockets for fun... What’s the point?

This mindset? It’s dangerous. It’s a comfort blanket soaked in gasoline.  
Because here’s the truth: **you matter.** And the difference between despair and determination is usually just **one data point of progress**.

Ships can improve their CII rating. Planes can burn sustainable fuel. People can choose better paths—if they see that change is *possible*.

👉 Remind yourself:

* Human emissions top **36 billion tonnes** annually.
* Nature’s not the problem—it’s the context.
* Every tonne saved is a tonne not contributing to the storm.

So yeah—**bother**.

# Wrapping the Chaos in Clarity (Or Something Like It)

This isn’t just about carbon. It’s about connection. Between decisions and impacts. Between spreadsheets and storms.

CII isn’t perfect. Hell, it’s barely digestible some days. But it’s a language—one we can learn, speak, and eventually wield with purpose. Not fluently at first. Maybe not ever perfectly. But well enough to change course.

And when that happens? When you start to see the patterns, to feel the rhythm in the data, to trust your compass again—it clicks.

Not cleanly. Not elegantly. But profoundly.

**You don’t need to master this. You just need to move forward, eyes open, knowing that clarity isn’t a destination—it’s a direction.**

Now go. Spill less fuel. Chase your metric. Ignore your uncle (again). And remember—fog always lifts eventually.",1,1754548922.0,energyfuture,0,1.0,False

I’m a 28 year old teacher very active training mma 4/5 times a week for over 7 years, eating healthy etc. For over 4 years I’ve been switching up using zyn/velo/cigarettes/vapes and recently decided to quit. First time lasted a week then went out to a party and relapsed.Now I’m at week 3 and this time is certainly for good. Since around 3 years ago I’ve been struggling with MAJOR anxiety symptoms, brain fog twitching all over my body and could never pinpoint the cause. I’ve had situations where my heart would skip beats and then experience 190/200bpm for long periods of time, days where I couldn’t remember what I was doing in the morning due to brain fog or heavy twitching from my face down to my feet. Tried using vitamins magnesium potassium calcium b6/b12 omega even IVs NOTHING seemed to have an effect. I was extremely frustrated and started to have a depressive period.  Thinking I have major cardiac disruption or some kind of long term illness tetany was in the books too . Around 2/3 months ago i came across a feed here which suggested someone had similar symptoms due to snus/cigarette usage. That sparked a light that these symptoms started around the time of my nicotine addiction. I then began thinking about quitting but after using 5-7 6mg  a day it weren’t easy. I’m on week 4 now and I feel like very SLOWLY my nervous system is starting to recover. I’ve stopped using caffeine too as for the last year or so it has also caused me to have brain fog right after drinking a cup of coffee etc. After quitting I feel like there has been progress in the anxiety although it has not gone away , I have been extremely tired and have been having 2-3 naps during the day, the brain fog is still there although it does seem to be slowly subsiding. I’m just praying this is it and I have found the cause. Wanted to share my experience as I know a lot of people are probably on the same boat and are struggling to find a solution.

He would even steal tings like toilet paper and cleaning products from the company's restrooms. Coffee, teabags, condiments, soaps, paper plates/cups and napkins or just about WHATEVER THE FUCK he could grab and put his goddamn dirty-ass hands on. And everytime he stole somethin', he would put on like this completely INNOCENT 😳LOOK on his face and claim that stuff was missing everywhere, and then go around asking EVERYBODY if they had ever seen or taken anything. Yeargh, that's how CHEAP the bastard actually was. Singh the 'rag-top' motherfucker (as my buddy would affectionately call him) was using his higher-up position in the company to EXPLOIT people; especially his immediate co-workers. Like seriously man, I mean he was basically ROBBING the same workplace where he was employed at. He would always act like he was the EMPEROR of India, or the KING of Pakistan. Always reachin' down to grab or scratch his NUTSACK whenever he also FARTED around the workplace premises. Really fuckin' sick, ya know what I mean? Every morning, he would come to work HELLA EARLY like at 6AM and then try to accuse all of his co-workers of being LATE. In fact, he always came to work early just so that he could STEAL somethin'. He likes to talk DOWN and DIRTY to younger people (both employees and customers alike) and would always try to make 'em feel HELLA STUPID, like they were LESS than human or whatever. He was constantly PRESSURING them, and PUSHING them around and around. Ya know, basically 'GASLIGHTING' you with condescending insults, and in a really mean hurtful tone. He would always talk and act like he stood at least 10 stories higher ABOVE everybody else, and then some. That's exactly how mean he was! He would go far outta his way just to annoy the fuck outta other people, and will try his best to make 'em feel hella miserable and uncomfortable at the workplace. Just basically, filling up the whole air in the workplace with all kindsa insults, sneers, and rude-ass comments/remarks. Whenever his co-workers went into his office to inquire about questions or problems at work, he would NEVER offer ANY kinda help or advice whatsoever; but would instead chew them out, and just basically tell them to go 'FUCK OFF' and figure shit out by themselves. And then he would just slam the door right in their faces! He was a total manipulator and a narcissist; who NEVER dropped his 'act'. He had like a whole buncha different fuckin' attitude problems about him too. Whenever someone celebrated a birthday, he would call them OLD. Whenever someone was getting married, he would ask them if someone in their family has DIED. Just sayin' so that you know, what kinda EVIL-HEARTED person he actually was. My buddy would describe that working everyday under this #1 CERTIFIED ASSHOLE felt just like being dragged (while NAKED) thru all the miles 'n miles of SHITPIPES and SEWERS underneath the city of New York, OK? This piece of SHIT would always ask his co-workers to help him buy lunch; citing that he was just way too damn hella busy and pile-up with all kindsa work-related shit to do, and couldn't leave the office. And he would promise to pay them back afterwards. Only to say later, that he had left his wallet at home, lost it somewhere, or that he just didn't have enough spare change on him. Or some other made-up bullshit as an excuse. And despite being a Sikh; he would order stuff like steak dinners, lamb chops, and crabs, lobsters, prawns or oysters and all that kinda crazy-expensive upscale restaurant food. He has some rather expensive taste in food, but just never had enough money to pay for it tho. He would just sit there in his office like he was ROYALTY, and slowly devour his food (taking a 2-hour lunch break). He also smoked quite a few packs a day and would often even drink a great deal too. Not just beer or wine coolers, but HARD LIQUOR; like some kinda throat-burnin' stuff ya know. And that's when this crazy old bastard would go into a full-on explosive alcohol-fueled rage, and just put on a real SHIT SHOW right infront of all his co-workers. ROARING at people to get back to work, and then callin' them all kindsa offensive and derogatory names. Totally crazed and outta control, like he was gonna take HOSTAGES or somethin'. Complete with foul-ass stinkin' breath, from all that alcohol and whatever nasty shit he ate. But then when confronted about the MONEY, he would always try to come up with some kinda fake-ass bullshit story, saying that he would be SHURE to pay back all the money he owed them by tomorrow; only to TOTALLY FORGET about the whole damn incident on the very next day! At BEST, he would eventually pay 'em back like only a very small portion of the money which he owed; like at least a week afterwards or perhaps even a month later? But that rarely ever happens tho. Basically, he was a real LOW-LIFE SLEAZEBAG and all-around DIRTY JACKASS MOTHERFUCKER. Then I heard about one crazy incident, where he had tried to coerce a young female co-worker (who was White or Latina) they had recently hired from fresh outta college. She was prolly only about 21 or so I think. Yeargh, just real young and innocent-lookin'. She was totally new to the company, and had NO fuckin' clue what this dirty-ass supervisor was all about, nor what he had in mind. I think they said that he got her DRUNK, then THREATENED and FORCED her into like some small back storage room while the others had either gone away somewhere else to work or all went out to lunch one day, and then this low-life scumbag perverted creep SEXUALLY ASSAULTED her! Now since we're on Reddit, and with all due respects for some of our female Redditors out there who may also be readin' this: I prolly cannot disclose all the graphic and heinous details here. Sorry! But all I can tell you tho, is that he tried to do some really SICK NASTY PERVERTED things to her. Like some of her clothes were ripped off or missing, and she was just CRYING hysterically and everything. Ya know what I mean? When the co-workers finally came back and found out all about it, lost their SHIT, and beat his old smelly ass up REAL GOOD and then they called the COPS. He did some time in jail, but heard that he was released just a few years ago, and I think they either sent or deported his dirty smelly ass all the way back to Singapore; where he prolly worked for some other gullible company. I have moved outta town and have not seen nor heard from my buddy ever since then, so I dunno fer shure what happened to supervisor 'Singh' after that. Dunno if you even care to read all of this shit, but I'm just puttin' it out there just so ya'll know, and hopin' that others (especially the LADIES) will be alot more wary of such DANGEROUS and TREACHEROUS individuals; who are obviously trying not only to LEECH the system, but also to PREY ON and DESTROY our once peaceful and beautiful American society! 😞",1,1754548053.0,Rants,0,1.0,False
