Something like this (sorry if the video ain't the crispiest, first time using built in windows record), so you see it doesn't copy or paste the sorters from there, and I don't have a clue why, when if I paste the same BP it works.",1,1760358099.0,Dyson_Sphere_Program,0,1.0,False

You addressed it so sweetly. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt the sandwich ‚Äî maybe it was just your perfume sweetening the whole place and messing with my taste buds.

You might also remember I asked you how to pronounce your name ‚Äî no way I would‚Äôve guessed it from the spelling. You‚Äôve got such a lovely name. And your perfume‚Ä¶ I had to read the same paragraph in my book 7 times because every time you walked by, it completely distracted me.

I even came to the back of the aircraft to talk to you ‚Äî but you were enjoying your noodles, so I just awkwardly pretended to use the loo and went back to my seat. Couldn't disturb a hardworking lady on her snack break, right?

It‚Äôs been more than a day since the flight, and you‚Äôre still on my mind. Regret‚Äôs hitting hard for not saying more. If you do happen to see this, DM me maybe? It‚Äôd be so damn cinematic if we actually managed to find each other again.

Do it for the plot, my lady with the pretty eyes and lovely name :‚Äô)

1o5i609,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/1o5i609/theres_nothing_wrong_with_having_depth_so_why/,"There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having depth, so why does it feel like it‚Äôs working against me in dating?","I hope I don‚Äôt come across as tooting my horn. I‚Äôm genuinely wondering as I‚Äôve been struggling with dating for six years. Yes, you heard that right ‚Äì six whole years. Except for one man, I‚Äôve never gone on more than three dates with the same person, and in total, I‚Äôve probably been out with about six guys. I usually left first coffee dates feeling meh, but I‚Äôd still try to stay open-minded and initiating second ones, which always ended with the same realisation: we were incompatible, or the guy couldn‚Äôt care less.

I even once posted [my dating profile on this site](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1nskcr9/rate_my_profile/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for feedback. It‚Äôs been deleted, but I included photos of me paragliding, hiking and kayaking as I wanted to communicate my love for adventures and physical activities. Most people commented that it‚Äôs not about me, that dating is hard everywhere. But [this comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1nskcr9/comment/ngo1s9m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)has been stuck in my head ever since. It reminds me of this guy I recently went on two dates with. He told me his hobbies were ‚Äúbeing in nature‚Äù and ‚Äúspending time with his daughter‚Äù (he‚Äôs divorced). But when I probed deeper ‚Äì where he goes, what he does ‚Äì he couldn‚Äôt really say. No mention of hiking, camping, anything. Meanwhile, I take my hobbies seriously. Exploring what I‚Äôm physically capable of and discovering new sides of myself through those experiences is my source of joy. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm the deepest and most introspective person you‚Äôll ever meet, but I‚Äôm curious and have a permanent hunger for understanding the different ways the world operate. I love digging into the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù of things and can‚Äôt take much at face value. I‚Äôm also deeply interested in social issues that don‚Äôt personally affect me and fascinated by other cultures.

So on our second date, I asked many perfectly normal questions like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favourite city?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat have you learnt from doing your PhD in Early Childhood Education that someone like me wouldn‚Äôt have known?‚Äù, only to receive answers like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember.‚Äù If anyone asked me that question, I would have soooo much to say and maybe too excited to speak coherently. This is the guy who stayed silent when I told him I love people who make me question my own assumptions and see things I wouldn‚Äôt have considered on my own.

It honestly confused me because this guy hat a PhD, which means he has intellectual depth. I believe everyone is shaped by a unique mix of childhood environments and experiences, which give each of us our own particular interests and depth. Whatever is the reason some people don't want to follow their natural curiosity doesn't matter, because my issue remains the same: I just don‚Äôt feel connected to people like that. And when you pair that with the comment saying my profile ‚Äúconveys high expectations‚Äù and would scare off conventional men, it really got to me. I see myself as a completely ordinary woman who feels alive doing what she loves. If that intimidates men, then maybe it‚Äôs for the best. I don‚Äôt want to shrink myself to appeal to them. And if insecure men are all that‚Äôs left in the dating pool, maybe it‚Äôs time I learn to accept that I‚Äôll be single for the rest of my life. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to tell myself but deep down, I feel depressed and resentful at how unfair it all seems. It seems easier for men to find partners who supports their ambitions, whilst women get punished for having deep emotional connection with her lives.

Being alone for this long is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I feel so invisible that I recently fell for the psychological manipulation of a man I only met for two hours.

I noticed recently some of the newer items looked a bit like ai but I brushed it off for a while not wanting to accuse anyone.

I want to email them and ask if they know, but I also don‚Äôt wanna just accuse people obviously. It just is bugging me not knowing if the owner (an older person) actually knows, because this shop also commissions real, local people for murals and artworks, so I feel like they might not support ai work if they knew they had some up.

The Life of a Showgirl caught everyone off guard.

What happened next was classic Taylor business strategy. Pre-orders went up minutes after the announcement. But her company, TAS Rights Management LLC, had already filed trademarks for The Life of a Showgirl, TLOAS, and TS before most fans even knew what was happening.

Want to see exactly what TAS Rights Management LLC filed? You can check it all out here: [https://www.trademarkia.com/docket-report/the-life-of-a-showgirl-99331566](https://www.trademarkia.com/docket-report/the-life-of-a-showgirl-99331566)

The filings covered concerts, performances, merch - basically everything from posters to coffee mugs. She locked down the branding before anyone else could touch it.

Now that we've lived with the album for a bit, it's clear she was capturing something real about life on the road. The glitter and exhaustion, the highs and comedowns, all of it. Fans were right when they guessed it would focus on her touring experience.

Looking back, this era feels different from her previous releases. Less about romance or revenge, more about what it costs to be on stage night after night. The album's held up well.

1o5hzvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagersnew/comments/1o5hzvc/i_am_dependent_on_psychoactive_substances_for/,I am dependent on psychoactive substances for emotional regulation and to manage my mental health. AMA,"So basically yes I am not outright addicted I have it under control but I can't be sober for extended periods of time (beyond 3 weeks). I am currently 19 years old and I got into mind altering substances at 15(I put both caffeine and nicotine in this category of psychoactives because they by science are).

I started drinking coffee at 15 and was getting really buzzed to the point I was asking myself how this could be legal (lol) back then my brain was naive. After a while I quickly picked up vaping nicotine just cuz I wanted to be 'cool' and was left even more amazed by how strong and blissful the effects felt at first even though I felt really nauseous and sick as I overdid it but in sometime I became a daily vaper and at 16 had a huge mod that blew clouds so big I'd fog the entire room in one hit.

I used to be naughty as hell like bro I'd be vaping in the classroom while the teacher went out for 2 minutes just to impress people with my clouds like 0 stress of getting caught bruh I was a menace and I didn't change üò≠. 

At 15 was also the first time I drank alcohol and I embarrassed myself so badly I had a crush on this girl but I was so shy and awkward I didn't know how to pursue her she even talked shit about me to other classmates calling me dumb but I still liked her and I was getting bullied too it was really weird I was both popular but also bullied by everyone not because I was 'wrong' probably because people we're jealous of me I was a different breed just a ruthless mf. 

But anyway back to this first time I drank alcohol it was end of the school year and the class decided to do an outdoor picnic and they had drinks I was sad because in this year I got bullied and betrayed by people I considered my best friends it was complicated to cope or shall I say I had no coping skills at all everything felt raw now I have more experience but at the time that hit me so damn hard üòî. I felt really bad but at the same time I was really excited to try alcohol for the first time EVER I wasn't even invited to this damn picnic I had to ask someone for the location it was painful to be excluded like that but I still went anyway got there said an awkward hello they were all chatting my crush was there too and I thought 'this is my moment'. 

So now to my first drink this other girl poured me whiskey(I think?) combined with cola tasted it and honestly it wasn't horrible and man did I feel the effects I didn't even drink much but the effects hit me like a truck I got insanely emotional. I awkwardly sat next to my crush and having no social skills I didn't know how to do it so I was being needy I took an embarrassing rejection that made me get up go to a tree and start hysterically crying. Got approached by classmates as they were worried for me and I finally got the attention I was craving so badly. I started saying how I'll end myself and how my best friend betrayed kept crying and they called my mom bruh üò≠. So embarrassing one of the worst days of my life. After that day I forever lost my 'coolness' in the eyes of those people it was social death I can't even put into words how embarrassed I felt.

But that was my last school year too because at 16 I got into a programming college baby üòÅü§ü Thought this was a new chance to redeem myself and a new fresh start oof turned out to be even worse than school but this post is about my drug use not life story feel like I went a bit of track. But anyway college is where I tried most of the drugs my first ever illegal drug was lsd (I know completely insane most normal people try weed or something I was different) and man I don't regret it one bit it made me see things better and shaped my personality and made me who I am today but for Christ's sake please do not do what I did.

From lsd to different kinds of amphetamine research chemicals mdma and mushrooms I did a lot of things besides freaking weed because my parents found it and again worst day ever so I decided to never do drugs that have a smell/need to be smoked. If my parents didn't find my weed I probably would've never gotten into hard drugs fuck you mom.

By age 17 I was doing drugs once every 1 or 2 months but quit because of legal risk and no finances so instead I got dependent on caffeine and nicotine to be able to cope with my severe depression and trauma from being bullied. I was drinking insane amounts of caffeine like I'd take 20g of instant coffee powder in one cup (for reference 1 usual cup is 2G so 10x that) I'd get on cs go and rage so bad bro üò≠ so from 17-18 I was hopelessly depressed and dependent on nic and caf the withdrawals hit me harddd I was an anxious mess. Eventually quit then got back at it again started having alcohol binges had like 2 times I went on 5 day benders. 

So now to the present moment I cannot function normally if I don't get drunk or have caffeine or nicotine every couple of days I quite literally feel like I would implode if I stayed sober it's not even about using daily it's about knowing that there's a lever that can make me feel good even in my darkest of times. I know am dependent but I function way better with then without.

Drugs are now part of my life and I don't have a need to quit because they help me stay grounded but I just wanted to share my story I might've went a bit off track but maybe there's people like me. Be free to ask whatever you'd like.",1,1760357584.0,teenagersnew,1,1.0,False

- I‚Äôve worked at Costa before and was hired despite having no work experience previously. I left quite early (only 5 months which I know looks bad) but I was on great terms with my previous manager and team. I was fully qualified very early on, given quickest improvement award, very active and was even looking to be given BM. After a family emergency I was given a leaving party and free drinks, and told they would be happy to give a positive reference in the future.

-2 years down the line, I applied to a different Costa in another town . I had a better cv since I worked there before, had all the relevant skills, really emphasised on my cover letter that I wanted something permanent and was open availability. The job posting was put up and within 24 hours I had completed the ai assessment (whole other rant I could talk about) and given good feedback. I got an email today saying the job had been filled, not even 3 days after the original job posting was listed. 

I would be grateful for any advice from managers at Costa. Is this a generic reason which is given to everyone and I was just bad luck? Is it just the job market or being in a very studenty area? Or could I have done anything differently to improve my chances ie did I need to go in person or phone up and really get it out there that I wanted this job? Should I explain my gap on my cover letter next time? I opted to not explain it since I didn‚Äôt want to seem too negative and wanted to focus on the current day, but maybe I should‚Äôve?

I just feel a bit lost and down in the job search, and I thought Costa would be my saving grace having worked there before.  Thank u in advance!

I already have a good grinder that I‚Äôve been using for my whole bean pour overs and such.  I plan on moving towards a non-pressurized portafilter until I fully decide on what accessories I want to buy. 

A question I have is fundamentally what is different between something like the Stilesso and some crazy $1000+ machine? Fundamentally, as I understand it, the machine exists to push pressurized water through a puck of grounds to extract and create espresso.  To me, it would seem, that the biggest determination of espresso quality would come down to bean quality, grind, and proper tamping and all of that.  Everything inside the portafilter right?

Like others' pain, joy, and disappointment. She can tear up very easily, but her tears come from her being compassionate, not from weakness. Very soft-spoken daydreamer, Angel finds herself often daydreaming these poetic thoughts. Finding beauty in the small things around her and in the house. Like her reflections in puddles or the sound of rain, even the sounds of the other objects chatting amongst themselves. She is self-conscious. She often struggles with her own self-esteem; she often thinks she is ""too much"" or ""not enough,"" especially when it comes to the needs of others. Sincerity often comes from a place of genuine feeling, so she will often be very truthful and honest. Nurturing, she has a need to help and take care of others when they are upset or down. Offering her own tissues or just someone to vent their struggles to. She believes every heart can be soothed with kindness. There's a melancholic charm; there's quite a sadness behind her smile. Despite knowing how to comfort others, she never quite figured out how to comfort her own needs. Hidden resilience, Even when she is down trembling, she keeps moving forward. Her strength is subtle, like silk holding everything together. Even when pulled thin. 

Backstory: After being brought home from the Valdivian store, she sits on the coffee table, being there for anyone who needs her. She's made with the finest silk any tissue protector can be made with. This has affected her to be very emotional. She will state that even if she is emotional, it only makes her stronger. She often roams around the house, often drifting into deep dissociative states from daydreaming. Often having to be told to snap out of it. Angel is often seen comforting others when they are struggling. Easily being able to lift them up to their happy spirits again. She does this so often, to a point of neglecting her own needs.

# Manufacturing Process of Almond Brittle

# 1. Ingredient Preparation

* **Almond Selection:**
   * Use high-quality, uniform, raw or blanched almonds.
   * Moisture content should be low (<5%) to prevent sogginess.

   * Almonds are roasted at 150‚Äì160¬∞C for 10‚Äì15 minutes to enhance [aroma and crunch.](https://www.unwraphappiness.in/collections/chocolates)
   * Cooling follows immediately to retain crispness.

# 2. Sugar Syrup Preparation

* **Cooking the Base:**
   * Sugar, glucose syrup, and sometimes butter are heated in a jacketed kettle.
   * The mixture is boiled to 145‚Äì150¬∞C (soft crack to hard crack stage).
   * Optional: small amounts of salt and vanilla for flavor balance.
* **Color Development:**
   * As sugar caramelizes, it develops a rich amber hue and deep caramel aroma.

# 3. Mixing

   * Roasted almonds are added to the hot caramelized syrup and mixed thoroughly for even coating.
   * The mixture must be handled quickly before it hardens.

# 4. Forming and Shaping

* Rolled out evenly with rollers to desired thickness (typically 3‚Äì6 mm).
* Cut into sheets, bars, or bite-sized pieces while still warm.

# 5. Cooling and Breaking

* Allow the slab to cool completely (room temperature or in cooling tunnels).
* Once hardened, it‚Äôs broken or cut into clean shapes using mechanical cutters.

# 6. Coating (Optional)

* For premium variants, the brittle may be half-dipped or [drizzled with chocolate](https://www.unwraphappiness.in/products/almond-brittle) (dark, milk, or white).
* Some variants add **sea salt or flavor glaze** on top.

# 7. Packaging

* Packed in **moisture-proof laminated films or tins** to preserve crispness.
* Nitrogen flushing is often used in pouches for extended shelf life.

#  Key Ingredients

|Ingredient|Purpose|
|:-|:-|
|**Sugar**|Base for caramelization and sweetness|
|**Glucose syrup / Corn syrup**|Prevents crystallization and improves texture|
|**Roasted Almonds**|Core ingredient providing crunch, flavor, and nutrition|
|**Butter or Ghee (optional)**|Adds richness and smooth mouthfeel|
|**Vanilla or Salt**|Enhances flavor balance|
|**Baking soda (optional)**|Introduced for a lighter, aerated brittle texture|

#  Flavor Variations

1o5hscx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoddessCafeTerrace/comments/1o5hscx/spoiler_preview_for_chapter_215/,Spoiler Preview for Chapter 215,"This spoiler is brought to you from a Spanish source and also from myanimelist, so it's very likely true.

Moemi decides to postpone taking over the family business and stay a little longer at Chiyoda's restaurant.

Tina, as a traveler, suddenly embarks on another trip.

Meanwhile, at Familia, it's reported that the resort's development plan has been canceled. Now they can continue running Familia with peace of mind (the coffee shop won't be destroyed).

""So... you're finally going to say it, huh?""

All the girls \[Expressions of curiosity\]

Hayato: ""Sorry to keep you waiting so long. The one I love is...""

‚ÄîThe scene changes to the daughter in the future.

""Today was the anniversary of the cat, Sachiko's, death.""

Then, the daughter's mother (the heroine) arrives home.

Back to the present‚Äî

Hayato: ""The one I love is...""

Ami interrupts Hayato before he can finish his words.

""I won the world karate championship, so before I open a dojo, I'm going on a training trip with Tina."" Hayato is exasperated by Ami's free spirit and even takes a break from university.

Ignoring her ""At least listen to me before you go,"" Ami leaves.

I've been searching different forums in Japanese, Spanish, and English. Curiously, these are the most popular results I've seen:

In Japan, from what I've seen, they have this ranking of how they think Hayato will choose: Ouka-Ami-shiragiku. Incredibly, they rule out Akane and Riho (I don't know why).

In Spanish forums: Ouka-Akane, they rule out Riho, Shiragiku, and Ami (it seems Spanish speakers associate QQ with this manga a lot).

In English forums: Akane-ouka-Ami, they rule out Shiragiku and riho.

Now, if this spoiler is true, it definitely favors only two heroines, Ami and Ouka (but it subtly favors Ouka, since Ami considers Ouka her best friend, and they got along together from the beginning. She's the one who has cared about her the most from the beginning, too). It's said in Japan that Ami doesn't want to hear the answer because she doesn't feel ready (mature) for Hayato to decide to give the answer, and that whether she's rejected or accepted, she has to grow up first. This is something Seo would really do for Ami's character, since at least that way she wouldn't come across as someone with childish thoughts by the end of the story.

Even though the manga is fast-paced, this is Seo's great thing about it, as he can turn the story around in half a chapter.

From my perspective, and how I think the story will continue, Hayato can either postpone his declaration until Ami returns. This is a dramatic element that Seo Kouji can use to leave the suspense of who will win until the end, combining the final girl chosen with the epilogue (this is the most likely scenario). Or even if Ami leaves, Hayato gives his answer and chooses the girl he wants to be with, all the other girls accept it, and Ami ends up returning and also congratulates the girl Hayato previously chose. (Honestly, Seo can play with many narrative endings.)

With all this in mind, I think it's decided between Ouka-Akane and Ami (I think Seo is playing with the narrative here that Ami is the surprise final girl of the manga). This diminishes Riho and Shiragiku as the surprise final girls. This confirms that both Riho and Shiragiku are the two girls with the least chances.

Well, really, nothing is set in stone until the final chapter. Seo will end up throwing in plot twists until the beginning of the final chapter, where everything will end.

This is the last formal interview that Seo did regarding her manga: [https://plus.rurubu.jp/article/887379917](https://plus.rurubu.jp/article/887379917) , since past interviews were deleted and mark error 404 or are simply no longer anchored, but I remember having seen at the beginning of this manga that Seo said that the winner of his manga will depend in part on the polls that will choose the winning girl, now he does not specify that the winning girl necessarily has to be first, second or third place but the poll is something that always takes into account to choose the winning girl. now debating these things is very trivial, since there are only a few chapters left until the end.",0,1760356971.0,GoddessCafeTerrace,1,0.5,False

1o5hppv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5hppv,Angel (DE Oc),"Personality: Angel is very empathetic and emotional; she often feels things deeper than the average person does. Like others' pain, joy, and disappointment. She can tear up very easily, but her tears come from her being compassionate, not from weakness. Very soft-spoken daydreamer, Angel finds herself often daydreaming these poetic thoughts. Finding beauty in the small things around her and in the house. Like her reflections in puddles or the sound of rain, even the sounds of the other objects chatting amongst themselves. She is self-conscious. She often struggles with her own self-esteem; she often thinks she is ""too much"" or ""not enough,"" especially when it comes to the needs of others. Sincerity often comes from a place of genuine feeling, so she will often be very truthful and honest. Nurturing, she has a need to help and take care of others when they are upset or down. Offering her own tissues or just someone to vent their struggles to. She believes every heart can be soothed with kindness. There's a melancholic charm; there's quite a sadness behind her smile. Despite knowing how to comfort others, she never quite figured out how to comfort her own needs. Hidden resilience, Even when she is down trembling, she keeps moving forward. Her strength is subtle, like silk holding everything together. Even when pulled thin. 

Backstory: After being brought home from the Valdivian store, she sits on the coffee table, being there for anyone who needs her. She's made with the finest silk any tissue protector can be made with. This has affected her to be very emotional. She will state that even if she is emotional, it only makes her stronger. She often roams around the house, often drifting into deep dissociative states from daydreaming. Often having to be told to snap out of it. Angel is often seen comforting others when they are struggling. Easily being able to lift them up to their happy spirits again. She does this so often, to a point of neglecting her own needs.

Location: She can be found on the coffee table in the living room.   ",8,1760356786.0,DateEverythingElse,0,1.0,False

I was at a home goods store looking for a new coffee table, nothing fancy, just something sturdy for my living room. The salesperson, Maria, greeted me without hovering and asked what I was after. I explained my budget and needs, and she showed me a couple of options that fit perfectly.

But here's the part: One piece was on the edge of my price range, and I hesitated. Instead of pushing the upsell or ""special today only"" line, she said, ""No rush, this one's great, but if it doesn't feel right, come back anytime. We've got more coming in next week."" She even jotted down her extension on a card in case I had questions later.

I left empty handed that day, but her no pressure vibe stuck with me. Two days later, I returned and bought not just the table but a lamp too, because she made me feel like the decision was mine, not hers to close. Now it's my go to spot for home stuff.

Stains are generally classified as extrinsic (superficial), intrinsic and age-related enamel thinning.

For superficial stains, maintaining oral hygiene, such as using whitening toothpaste, flossing, cleaning with coconut oil, and eating crunchy fruits, can be effective. When stains are more stubborn, professional treatments like dental scaling and polishing or dental whitening under the supervision of a dentist can produce noticeable results.

To prevent future stains, limit your intake of staining substances, stop using tobacco, rinse after eating stained foods and drinks, and visit your dentist regularly. By combining regular home care with professional dental services, patients can achieve and maintain a bright and confident smile.

I (28F) work in a small office, about 12 people. We have a single-stall bathroom that's shared by everyone.

Last week I was coming back from lunch and arrived at the same time as my coworker ""Brad"" (31M) was leaving the bathroom. I went in right after him to wash my hands before returning to work.

The soap dispenser was completely dry. Like, bone dry. I had to refill it from the backup under the sink. Which meant Brad definitely didn't use any soap.

I thought maybe it was a one-time thing, maybe he didn't notice? But then I started paying attention (I know, creepy, but I couldn't help it). Over the past week, I've gone into the bathroom after him three more times. Soap dispenser was dry every single time. And I've never heard the water running when I'm near the bathroom door when he's in there.

This guy does NOT wash his hands. At all. After using the bathroom.

And here's what makes it worse: he's always eating communal snacks from the bowl in the break room. He uses the shared coffee pot. He touches door handles, the copy machine, the fridge handle. EVERYTHING.

I don't know what to do with this information. Do I say something to him directly? That seems incredibly awkward. Do I tell our office manager? That feels like tattling but also... this is a legitimate hygiene issue that affects all of us?

I've started being hyper-aware of what he touches and trying not to touch those things, but I can't avoid everything. I'm honestly grossed out every time I see him grab a handful of pretzels from the communal bowl now.",9,1760356271.0,hygiene,19,0.71,False

Things went downhill fast after our first year together he lost interest in everything, stopped communicating, and was barely present in our relationship. He started drinking more, skipped work a lot, and when I tried to talk to him about it, he‚Äôd either shut down or tell me I was ‚Äúnagging.‚Äù

I begged him to try couples counseling, but he refused, saying he needed to ‚Äúfigure his life out first.‚Äù So, after months of walking on eggshells and crying myself to sleep, I told him I needed space. I moved out but told him I wasn‚Äôt done I just needed him to actually try. I said if he went to therapy, got his life together, and showed he could be a partner again, we could talk about reconciliation. He agreed.

For months, he texted me every day saying how much he missed me, how he was working on himself, how he couldn‚Äôt wait to come home to me. He told me he started therapy, got a new job, and was ‚Äúfocusing on becoming the man I deserve.‚Äù I believed him. We even started going on coffee dates again to reconnect. I genuinely thought we had a chance.

Last week, though, everything fell apart. I got a message from a girl on Instagram who works with him. She told me she‚Äôs pregnant and that Ethan is the father. At first, I didn‚Äôt believe her, but she sent screenshots of their conversations and photos together. It was undeniable.

When I confronted him, he admitted it. He said it happened during ‚Äúa weak moment‚Äù when he thought I‚Äôd never take him back. He swore it meant nothing and that he still wanted our marriage. He begged me to forgive him and said he‚Äôd raise the baby but wanted to stay with me.

I told him no. I can‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs not even about the pregnancy it‚Äôs the lying, the pretending, the way he played both sides like he was healing while still doing things that would destroy me if I found out.

Now everyone around me has an opinion. My mom says I‚Äôm being ‚Äútoo harsh‚Äù and that ‚Äúpeople make mistakes.‚Äù His sister keeps calling me selfish for ‚Äúgiving up on him when he was finally trying.‚Äù Even our pastor told me that ‚Äúforgiveness is a part of love.‚Äù

But how do you rebuild something when the foundation is shattered? I‚Äôm only 22. I don‚Äôt want to spend my life pretending I‚Äôm okay sharing my husband with another woman‚Äôs baby. I wish I could be stronger, but the thought of staying makes me physically sick.

He keeps asking me to at least keep going to therapy ‚Äúas a couple,‚Äù but I told him I‚Äôm done. I filed for divorce last night. Now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering if I overreacted, if I should‚Äôve given him one more chance like everyone keeps saying.

**Hey Lil!**

Geez, that must be rough. Hope your parents sort their stuff out. You know you can always come over if things get too crazy over there, dad loves having you around. I got you that new metal CD you've been eyeing at the record store.

Things are also not that good over here. Dad hasn't made a single painting ever since mom died. The bills are piling up and soon we'll have to start selling stuff to get by. Do you know if Mark needs any more help at the CD store?

Love you! Dirk

**Hey Lil!**

It was nice sneaking out with you last night, lucky that dad sleeps like a rock XD! He got a job from a girl he met somewhere, supposed to be an engagement gift or something. She comes by to pose and let me tell you, she is creepy and kinda cooky, but I like her. Dad seems to like her too. At least he's working again. I got a job fixing up computers and setting up printers over the neighborhood, so this is helping a bit. Heard your aunt and cousin moved back into town, how is that going??

Love you! Dirk

**Hey Lil**

I can't believe your dad put you in private school. And just when you thought you would have some space from Angela too. Can't even imagine school without you :(((

So after about a week of Dad doing nothing but admiring cooky girl's portrait (dude is lost I tell ya) he went to the wedding and guess what?? COOKY GIRL WAS LEFT AT THE ALTAR. I can't even imagine something like that. You know I would never do that to you, right?

Love you! Dirk

**Hey Lil**

YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT NOT ONLY YOU KNOW COOKY GIRL, BUT SHE¬¥S YOUR MOM'S BESTIE??? man such a small hood. Dad is singing and painting again, guess he really does have a heavy crush on her. Wish I could get them together. It'd be nice to see him move on from mom. I miss her too, but man deserves to be happy. And me too. Glad I got you

Love you! Dirk.

**Hey Lil**

How are you handling the divorce? Sweet that you got a new MP3 player though, those things are HELLA expensive. Man, technology really is impressive, you don't even need CD players anymore. They can't possibly invent anything else.

So guess what, Cassandra (Cooky Girl) is now my science teacher at school. This gives me a golden opportunity to give dad a second chance. Any ideas?

Love you! Dirk.

**Hey Lil**

I like your plan, but I'm not sure if I am cut out for it. I know I CAN cause enough problems during science class to get dad called to school, but I am not sure I am enough of a rebel. I am not awesome like you.

Love you! Dirk.

**Hey Lil**

I followed your plan to the letter! There was screaming, chaos, confusion, and an almost-fire, just like you planned. Cassandra had to call dad in, and she instantly let me off the hook. They are going for coffee soon, so now it is up to dad (my work here is done). Do you think he still knows how to flirt? He hasn't had to do it in 99 years. I am grounded for the rest of my life, so it was nice knowing you! PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO MOVE ON! I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY! Tell harry I said hi to your kids! D:

Love you! Dirk.

**Hey Lil!**

Great job on the after-curfew-school-trespassing-concert last night! Glad dad didn't see me sneak out. I would be grounded for 2 lifetimes. I hope I can convince dad to let me participate in the battle of robots next Sunday. I wonder if Cassandra can help me win him over. So, as it turns out she has this younger brother who is just a couple of years younger than us. Dude is a high class nerd (ikr, I'm one to talk) (but I mean it, dude is like, on another level). Dad wants me to be his friend and Cassandra brought him over once or twice. He has really helped me crack a lot of this robot things. He's cool, I want you to meet him. Hope dad lifts the no-girlfriend rule sooner rather than later. I know how hard this being apart has been for you too. Keep me posted on your family biz.

1o5hgmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1o5hgmt/should_we_leave/,Should we leave?,"I (23 F) and my boyfriend (27 M) are currently in a difficult living situation we never really had to be in the first place. Our lease was about to expire and we were looking to move to a different state or at least different area. I just got out of college and had been applying to jobs and substitute teaching for money. He has a job  that provides for both of us for the most part, but I am looking for a career like anyone else my age. Typically I‚Äôd want to move somewhere for work but our lease was running out and I wasn‚Äôt successful at finding a job, it‚Äôs a tough economy, especially for bachelor‚Äôs degrees.  Over the summer we were offered a Hail Mary situation it seemed, to go work for and live with our friends in a remote area, and help them with their ski resort in the winter. 

There‚Äôs nothing that qualifies me for this work, I don‚Äôt even ski, but I was looking for a job and we were looking for a new place to live. The problem is we are incredibly isolated, all of our stuff is crammed into a room of boxes, and my boyfriend has 4 cats I‚Äôm rlly allergic too. In our old apartment, this was fine because they were kept entirely separate from my living/sleeping situation and it was just a more open space. 

Now we don‚Äôt even have a door on our room so we‚Äôve tried to barricade them out, but they all break in every night. We don‚Äôt really even have a bed it‚Äôs just 2 of us crammed on a futon, in a small room with boxes upon boxes of everything we own. We live in their house with their 2 kids and while I love them, and this beautiful area, and I truly want to help them, both my boyfriend and I are severely declining mentally. I want to hold out through the winter but I can‚Äôt imagine it gets any better. 

I can‚Äôt do the little things that used to make me human as easy. I need cooking to stay sane, and I don‚Äôt have my own kitchen. My little morning routine I dont have time or space for. Have no idea where any of my clothes are they are just all in boxes. It just doesn‚Äôt feel like we have a quality of life, and can‚Äôt get good sleep.

It also puts my post college job search to a pause because there‚Äôs nothing out here. It‚Äôs putting a strain on our relationship and it feels unnecessary when we have the financial capability to go rent somewhere. I can‚Äôt even write the book I was writing cuz the nearest coffee shop is 30 minutes away and not the kind of place you can sit down and work. 

It feels like my whole life has been put on pause to be miserable and part of me feels like I owe it to them, that they need my help, and would feel really wrong for leaving. They‚Äôve given us a so much, they are giving us so much, and even building a cabin they‚Äôve been trying to build for a while, and we can stay in that before the winter comes. While that would be an improvement from our current situation, we wouldn‚Äôt have running water, and it‚Äôs still in this very isolated area. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I can hold out for the winter, we‚Äôve been here since August and I cry myself to sleep every night just missing our old life, the simplest of things about it. I‚Äôm also just really physically impacted by my allergies and I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything but fall deeper into depression. No hobbies, no time or peace for them. No ability to find work I‚Äôm passionate about or at least can use my degree for. But I would feel so wrong for leaving. They understand the issues with our current situation and are doing everything they can to improve it. 

I would feel morally wrong for leaving before the winter, but I also think I should put myself first. I feel like we owe it to them for everything they‚Äôve done for us, we‚Äôre just really struggling and I can‚Äôt see it getting better, only worse. I‚Äôm really overwhelmed and out of my depth here, I‚Äôm not used to living in this rural of an area or this kind of work. 

It‚Äôs hard to communicate to them that we are even considering leaving since they need our help so badly. We could try renting somewhere within an hour of here (everything is at least an hour apart) so we can still help them while having our life back, but I don‚Äôt want to get stuck in a lease in an area I want to leave as soon as possible. It‚Äôs just 1 winter. 

So should we try to move somewhere else? Or should we hold out for the winter? Are there any other options I‚Äôm not thinking of? Thank you for anyone reading, I really just needed to vent, feeling very alone right now.

The next page you get to select from a small range of products. There was an iPhone and 2 different brand laptops, anker powerbank and coffee machine. 

I selected the IPhone kasi it only needed 6258 points tapos you only needed to add 188 pesos to complete the transaction. 

The next page asked for your delivery address and email. When I reached the last page, It asked for card details. I placed my debit card info but tumatanggap lang daw siya ng credit card.

I then asked my dad if I could input his credit card information and I would just pay him back kasi maliit lang naman na amount hinihingi (I know super bobo). 

After typing his credit card information, it directed me to a different page where it was asking for an OTP. When I typed the code in the box grabeh ang loading. 

My dad's bank (unionbank) texted that there was an attempted transaction of 9000 AED and it was for a fashion item. That's about 140k converted to pesos. We then got nervous. There was a second attempt from that scammer. 

Unionbank automatically blocked my dad's credit card.  Their customer rep then called asking if fraudulent ba yung transaction. We then went to the bank physically and my dad talked with their staff about the situation and then processed for him a new card which will come by mail in a week. 

Also asked my card to be blocked in BPI and then paid for my new card. Luckily the transactions never went through but I still gave that link a lot of personal information about me which is scary. 

Scammers are getting way too creative these days. Na sunod nila even ang template ng BPI website when you click the link. I was not able to take screenshot of each of the pages on the sketchy link kasi it doesn't redirect you back to the previous page.

1o5he75,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTACarDetailing/comments/1o5he75/newmarket_stain_removal/,Newmarket Stain Removal,"Stains on your car's upholstery can be a major headache. They not only make your car look dirty and unkempt, but they can also decrease its resale value. Whether it's spilled coffee, a pet accident, or a muddy shoe print, every car owner has had to deal with stains at some point. But don't despair, with the right tools and techniques, even the toughest stains can be removed.

The key to successful stain removal is acting quickly and using the correct method for the type of stain. First, assess the severity of the stain - is it a fresh spill or has it been there for a while? Next, identify the type of stain - is it water-based or oil-based? This will help determine the best course of action.

For water-based stains, such as coffee, soda, or juice spills, start by blotting the stain with a clean cloth to absorb as much of the liquid as possible. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain and damage the fabric. Once most of the liquid has been absorbed, mix a small amount of mild detergent with warm water and use a clean cloth to gently blot the stain. Rinse the area with a damp cloth and dry with a clean towel.

Oil-based stains, like grease and motor oil, require a different approach. First, sprinkle some baking soda onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes. Then, using a clean cloth, gently dab at the stain. If the stain is still visible, mix a small amount of dish detergent with warm water and blot the stain. Rinse and dry as before.

For tough stains that refuse to budge, a specialized stain remover or upholstery cleaner may be necessary. Be sure to test the product on a small, inconspicuous area first to avoid any damage to the fabric.

By following these tips, you can keep your car's upholstery looking clean and fresh. Remember, for the best results, act quickly, use the right method for the type of stain, and always test any products before use.

I was debating posting a rant or some other self pitying ramble in a relationships or mental health thread, but I've decided to look at ways forward rather than dwell on the past.


I've recently ended a 10 year relationship. I was depressed for the tail end of it, as was he. We both still are, but he has lots of family and friends around him. I certainly have people who care, but they are not local and can't make tea for me on those mornings where I can't get out of bed (which are increasingly frequent). Just to add to my despair I have a chronic physical illness as well.


I feel completely dead inside.


So at the ripe age of 39 I've had my OAP mum staying with me and she's been making me tea to coax me into the world every morning. 


This has really helped me, so I looked into a teasmade. Unfortunately there only seem to be a few models, all by Swan, with average to poor reviews. I have a sneaking suspicion they aren't actually a thing any more.


Should I just be looking for a coffee machine that will make me tea? If so, please help me out as I know nothing about coffee other than the water should NOT be boiling (which is what you need for tea!)


Ideally I want something I can keep by the bed so it's right there when I wake up. My dad had one that did the milk as well. 


Or is this an impossible ask and what I really need is a maid for the sole purpose of rousing me with tea, Paul Bearer and Undertaker style?


I really appreciate any thoughts you might have or any other ideas on keeping me out of my pit of despair (bedroom).",4,1760355713.0,CasualUK,10,0.75,False

We‚Äôve seen everything from ‚Äúdrink gallons of water‚Äù to ‚Äútry energy drinks‚Äù floating around online,  and most of it just makes things more complicated.

Here‚Äôs what actually matters:

* üíß **Too much water:** It‚Äôs easy to overdo it. Overhydration can dilute your urine, and labs check for that by measuring creatinine and specific gravity.
* ‚òï **Caffeine-heavy drinks:** Coffee, tea, and energy drinks act as diuretics, which means you‚Äôll be running to the bathroom more and potentially altering sample concentration.
* ü•§ **Sports or energy drinks:** The mix of B vitamins, minerals, and herbal ingredients in some of these can slightly change sample readings.
* üç∫ **Alcohol:** Even small amounts can affect hydration and kidney function, so most labs recommend avoiding it for at least 48 hours beforehand.

In short: **normal hydration is your best bet.** Not too much, not too little.

I was one of four area managers for a motor company, we had monthly meetings about 380 miles from where I live. Us four area managers used to meet at a hotel that suited us all the night before and travel together the next morning. It was rarely the same hotel twice as it depended where we were all working that week. 
One month we met in the hotel in the evening, everything was normal and we agreed to meet for a quick breakfast in the restaurant before we had to leave the next morning. Next morning, it appeared that I was the first one down, so I grabbed a table and had some coffee. After a few minutes I could hear my three colleagues talking so I thought I must have not seen them when I came in. I looked around but could not find them. It was such a weird thing, I could hear them all chatting, it was 100% them, they were talking about work, one even asked if anyone had seen me, they were wondering why I had not come for breakfast. I walked around the restaurant, foyer and reception. No sign of them but I could constantly hear them. 
I sat back down, feeling odd, I ate some breakfast wondering what the hell was going on. I heard on of them say they were going to go to my room and check on me. I should have stood up then and gone to my room, but I just didn‚Äôt, no idea why. They came back and said I must have already left as I was not in my room. I heard them all getting up and leaving but could not see them anywhere. Then, silence. I got my stuff together and walked out to car park. One of their cars was gone.

1o5h7jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1o5h7jo/am_i_being_punished_or_am_i_being_sensitive/,Am I being punished or am I being sensitive?,"Beth and I (34,F) have been best friends for 10 years. Her fiance Ross is seriously ill and she is essentially his carer. She has been going through a rough time balancing caring for Ross alongside full time work and caring for her mother who is also seriously unwell and her elderly grandfather. 

I have been a huge support, driving her to the hospital or picking her up from there. Showing up with care packages, food and flowers regularly. Cleaning her house. I even got her a job at my company which was more pay and offered healthcare benefits. An emotional support where we speak daily about her struggles and feelings. I also try and cheer her up, going on coffee dates, shopping, cinema etc and I always have her back. Even the night her grandad was passing away I stepped in and supported her by providing medical care for Ross so that she could say goodbye to her grandad. 

Last weekend we had planned to go shopping. I offered to drive and left the house at 2pm. She lives a 15min drive away and the shops were a further 15min drive from her house. She had to be back for 6pm to administer care for Ross. This would give us approx 3-3.5 hours at the mall.

However there was a terrible 3 car pile up half way between my house and hers and the entire city came to standstill. As soon as I hit the traffic, I called her to let her know the situation and that I would be late. She said it was fine and no rush. However I didn‚Äôt move for another hour so I called her and said it‚Äôs not looking good but hopefully it will clear. After another hour I still hadn‚Äôt moved by 4pm, so I had now spent 2 hours in the same spot. I would likely not get to her until 6pm which is when she would need to be home to care for Ross. So I called her again profusely apologising and explaining I think we had better call it off for this reason. Her tone was polite but clipped. She said ‚Äúyou get yourself home. have a lovely evening‚Äù and hung up. It was frosty, but I understood she was disappointed so I didn‚Äôt think much of it.

2.5 hours after this I arrived home. It was now 6:30pm and I had been in the traffic for over 4 hours since 2pm in what should have taken 15 mins. I was thirsty and desperate for the bathroom but the first thing I did was text her saying ‚ÄúI literally just got home! I‚Äôm so sorry about today I was really looking forward to it. Shall we try again tomorrow? Xxx‚Äù She replied ‚ÄúI appreciate it however I am unavailable tomorrow.‚Äù

Again I understood she was disappointed but I was a little bit surprised since the accident was all over the news and I was sending her pictures of the mad queues I was in and police everywhere. It wasn‚Äôt my fault that there was traffic and I couldn‚Äôt get to her but I get sometimes people under stress can be a bit snappy. I figured I‚Äôve apologised so now I‚Äôll give her some space to cool off.

The next day, I didn‚Äôt hear from her. We usually talk several times a day over text but I told myself she did say she was busy. Later, she posted a story on insta. It was a picture of her in a cafe, laughing and holding up a book titled ‚Äúhow to kill your best friend‚Äù. She had captioned the image with ‚Äúlovely day out shopping and coffee with my bestie‚Äù.

It‚Äôs important to note that when she feels slighted by people she enjoys making passive agressive digs via social media as revenge. She has admitted to this in the past and even encouraged me to join in, which I never did. 

It‚Äôs Monday late afternoon now and I still haven‚Äôt heard from her. We work at the same company but in different teams. I‚Äôm WFH today but I can see she‚Äôs online. 

Can someone tell me - am I being sensitive or is she mad at me? Did I do something wrong? I‚Äôm also annoyed that I‚Äôm being treated like this as I have been a good friend and this was out of my control - I communicated and apologised so I don‚Äôt know what else I could have done? My instinct tells me that she is mad and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair. I think perhaps I need to take some space and assess whether this friendship is worth fighting for.

So, I hope she is same age as him but, chances are she is younger so he is turning 18 quite soon and if she is not 18 would he have to stop all contact perhaps they are having intimate conversations already and if he all of a sudden is an ""adult"" she is a minor would he now be a criminal ? 

Or is this one of the circumstance that change the outcome due to their prior relationship and he isnt some old man trying to creep on a teen.

I had read so many posts that said ‚Äútrust your prep‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôll know when the screen shuts off,‚Äù but honestly? I didn‚Äôt know a thing when it happened. üòÇ

So here‚Äôs exactly how it went:


---

‚òÄÔ∏è Morning of the Exam

I barely slept the night before. I set 3 alarms because I had this nightmare that I‚Äôd oversleep and miss my slot. Woke up at 5:30 AM, couldn‚Äôt eat much, but I forced down a banana and coffee. I reviewed my quick Klimek notes for like 15 minutes (just to feel sane) and then told myself, ‚ÄúNo more cramming.‚Äù

Got to the Pearson center about 30 minutes early. There were a few other people waiting ‚Äî everyone looked just as terrified as me. üòÇ


---

ü™™ Check-In Process

They‚Äôre super strict. I had to lock away everything ‚Äî even my chapstick. Then they scanned my palms (yes, both hands), checked my ID like five times, and made me sign in on the tablet. The staff was polite but all business.

Then they led me to my cubicle. It was freezing in there (bring a jacket, trust me).


---

üíª The Actual Test

Once the screen popped up, I swear my brain blanked out for the first question. It was a SATA. üò©

But I remembered my Naxlex and SimpleNursing strategies ‚Äî read carefully, look for safety words, and don‚Äôt second-guess the ‚Äúnurse logic.‚Äù

I got a mix of:

SATA (so many)

Priority questions

Some NGN case studies

Few meds and lab value questions


At around question 70, I was mentally done. My palms were sweating, and I was praying silently at my desk. Then ‚Äî at question 85 ‚Äî the screen shut off.

My heart DROPPED.

I honestly thought I failed. I walked out trying not to cry because it ended so fast. Everyone said if it shuts off early, it could be really good or really bad. üòÖ


---

‚òï After the Exam

I went straight to Starbucks, sat in my car, and stared into space for like 20 minutes. My brain was fried. I kept replaying the questions in my head, thinking, ‚ÄúDid I pick the right SATA?‚Äù (Spoiler: that never helps.)


---

üì© The Next 48 Hours

Longest 48 hours of my life. I checked the Pearson Vue portal like every few hours. When the quick results came in, I could barely open them. And then ‚Äî there it was ‚Äî PASS. ü•≥

I cried right there in my kitchen. All the months of Klimek notes, Naxlex rationales, SimpleNursing videos, and self-doubt finally made sense.


---

üí° Takeaways:

Eat before your exam (your brain needs fuel).

Don‚Äôt overthink the number of questions. It means nothing.

Trust your prep. You‚Äôve seen this content before ‚Äî the test just disguises it.

Bring a sweater and deep breaths. üòÇ

- Where: I can sort out court bookings ‚Äî either North-West London or Central, depending on where most people are based
- Goal: to make it a regular weekly thing ‚Äî a social badminton club where we can improve our game by playing with different opponents, have fun, and grab a drink or coffee after games ‚òï

I‚Äôm happy to handle the court bookings, logistics, and organisation, so all I need right now is to see how many people would actually be up for it before I start planning the first one.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, drop a comment or DM me with:

I have lived alone for nearly a decade now and have always been fiercely independent, though I did not always thrive mentally by myself. I often let the house get very messy as I struggle with depression and often let things go. However, over the past year or so I have made great efforts to be better about this. I rarely ever allow dishes to sit in the sink for more than a day, prefer my surfaces clear, and do laundry frequently. I'm by no means perfect, but I am still trying to improve my habits so that I can get to the level of housekeeping that I was raised with.

However, there are some major rubs and it's triggering my control issues. His girlfriend is not dirty, but I would say that we have a different way of doing things. One thing that has been driving me nuts is her refusal to use the dishwasher. We both cook quite often, I would say several times a week, and when I cook I try to have an empty dishwasher and sink beforehand so that I can clean as I go and use the sink as a prep area. This has been a major aspect of my self improvement as I used to do it at the end and it would be overwhelming. The problem is that she handwashes almost everything. She uses one side of the sink as a drying space, and although she does the dishes almost daily, there are *always* dishes in the sink. She didn't grow up with a dishwasher and doesnt feel like it gets the dishes clean, and I understand that this may be a cultural difference, however, it is driving me insane. Additionally, when I have to clean this up, sometimes I will wash dishes by hand to save time, and about half the time the sponge has been knocked off and is sitting (wet!) in the bottom of the sink, which grosses me out.

I think the dishes power struggle is what aggravated the control issues, because the other night I rearranged the fridge and woke up to find my coffee creamer had been moved from the shelf to the door. Today I came home and found the cat feeder had been moved from the living room to my bedroom for some reason, and it nearly sent me into a blind rage. I'm self aware enough to realize that that was a disproportionate reaction to what she probably thought was helpful (my cat has been crying at my door while I'm sleeping), but I don't know how to control that burst of frustration that I feel when minor changes happen outside of my control. 

Does anyone have any experience with integrating back into shared living? Anyone with thoughts on how to control those impulses to throw a fit when things don't go as planned? I don't want to be like my mother.",2,1760354765.0,Advice,4,1.0,False
1o5h2dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrittanySpaniel/comments/1o5h2dc/thinking_of_rehoming/,Thinking of re-homing,"So, some of you may know Nanni, my incredible rescue that I happened to find about a year and a half ago. It breaks my heart to have these lingering thoughts about rehoming him to a better place. His background comes from getting rescued as a young puppy, and then lived in a garden/foster home for about a year and a half. He never got any basic training, nor did he ever actually get to experience much of life apart from roaming the backyard of that foster home. Unfortunately these were things that were told me, or that I had to find out much after the adoption. To this day I‚Äôm still shocked that they decided I would be a good fit for him, having described my lifestyle and living arrangement. I live alone in an apartment in a busy neighbourhood. I always liked the idea of having a dog like a Breton/Setter as I do love the outdoors, and consider myself an active person, but I also liked the idea that I can take my dog with me on a morning walk through the park and he actually enjoyed it, rather than being scared all the time. 

Since adopting him, we had many ups and downs. I quickly noticed he was far more anxious and had trouble with this new lifestyle, although I didn‚Äôt want to give up on him, and did many changes in order to satisfy his needs, such as: Driving him to a park instead of potty walks down the busy street. Minimum of 3 hikes per week in the woods, we do daily training/nosework/balance/agility with a trainer to help enrich his confidence and overall mood. However, after all this, I noticed that he probably won‚Äôt ever really enjoy the new change, and making me think all of this will just help him ‚Äútolerate‚Äù this new life more. When I take him to a friends house in the countryside with lots of green to roam around, he seems the happiest. As soon as we‚Äôre back home, he spends most days on the couch and bed. As much as I offer him time to play, enrichment toys/puzzle mats, I can tell that he‚Äôs in his prime when he simply gets to be himself; a hunting dog in a big green field. I worked with behaviouralists and vets to try out medication, natural remedies such as cbd, and such. It might help a tad, but I don‚Äôt think that alone is a remedy, if not just a way to cope with the troubles we face day to day. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think we bonded lots. He can chose were to sleep at night, but he‚Äôs always by my feet. He‚Äôs not a cuddly dog, but I can tell there‚Äôs affection. His recall is A+, which shows me there is trust and loyalty. I just fear that I‚Äôm setting him up for a life that he won‚Äôt enjoy at 100%. 

As much as I adapted my lifestyle to him, I fell into a pit where I miss seeing friends, going out for a coffee and stroll in the centre, and overall keep my days occupied. Many would say, you can do that and go on about your day, whilst your dog stays at home, but how happy would that make him? What sense is there for a dog to be a training partner for a couple minutes/hours a day and then the rest of the day we can‚Äôt share experiences together? Am I thinking too much about what I want? I feel as if all of these thoughts are because I want the best for him. I wouldn‚Äôt even consider him going off elsewhere unless it‚Äôs a family/home that I trust, and believe is the right fit (before I get the shelter comments). 

Today we have training in the afternoon, and I‚Äôm thinking of initiating this conversation with our trainer, whom knows Nanni well and can maybe give me some insight. However, maybe this is to vent, maybe to get some opinions from other owners‚Ä¶. am I in the wrong? I think me not wanting to go through this is more of my ego and not wanting him to be ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs dog‚Äù, but I think a dog should chose to be happy.

I got double incision with free nipple grafts on 03/10/2025 with Mr Ntanos at the Cadogan Clinic.

**08/07/2025**

Had my referral session with Fedora Laroza (booked via GenderGP since I've been with them for hormones, cost 185 pounds). She was lovely and the whole thing took about 45 minutes and she asked about my life, why I need top surgery, my goals, and childhood. Very easy process and I got the referral the same day.

I booked my initial consultation with Mr Ntanos immediately, and I also got a free consult with Cosmedicare just in case I decided to go with them (50 pound deposit, but was paid back when I decided not to go with them).

**29/07/2025**

Had my video call consultation with Mr Ntanos and everything went smoothly. He was very professional about pictures I had uploaded for him to look at of my pre-op chest. We discussed risks and how I'd like my chest to look after my surgery. He was open to anything I wanted to do with my nipples (hearts etc) but I just wanted them to be as masc as possible which he understood.

Few days later I had a phone call consult with Mr Raine from Cosmedicare, but decided against going with him.

**01/08/2025**

I emailed Mr Ntanos to tell him that I would like to go ahead with the surgery ASAP. He replied 3 minutes later informing me that there are some dates available in October and he will reply back with a couple when he can.

He said 3-4 Oct, 6-7-8 Nov, and 14 Dec were available, and I chose 03/10/2025.

He then booked it for me and informed me the procedure will start at noon unless indicated otherwise.

I received all confirmation emails and had to fill in 2 pre-op assessment forms that took about 30 minutes to do.

**04/08/2025**

I paid the initial deposit of 4,500 pounds.

**01/09/2025**

I paid the final deposit of 4,500 pounds for a total of 9,000 for the procedure.

In this waiting time, Mr Ntanos said I can have free calls with him to discuss any worries, but I did not need to, I just emailed him and he would respond very quickly if I had anything to ask about.

**02/10/2025**

I travelled down to London with my sister and brother in law and we stayed in a local hotel for the night.

I received an email and phone call to tell us to arrive at the Cadogan Clinic at 11:30 AM, my procedure was scheduled to start at 2 PM. I was to not eat anything for 6 hours before, and only small sips of clear liquid (water, tea/coffee with no milk/sugar) up until 2 hours before my admission time. I decided to just not eat or drink anything on the day.

**03/10/2025 - SURGERY DAY - 11:30 AM**

Arrived at the clinic and checked in, no ID was required but I brought my driving licence and passport just in case. I wore a zip up jacket, t-shirt, and loose joggers. I waited in the waiting room with my sister and brother in law.

**12:30 PM**

Had been waiting an hour and someone came to see me to apologise for my wait, and the nurse was now waiting for me. My sister and brother in law left.

The nurse led me down some stairs into a small room where she took my blood pressure, temperature, weight, height. She asked if there was any possibility I was pregnant (very politely) and I said no. I had to sign something saying there was no way I was pregnant or I would have had to do a pregnancy test.

She asked me what procedure I'm in for, date of birth, name etc. She put my wrist band on and told me how to put on the compression stockings and the gown, and that I was allowed to keep on my own boxers.

She left the room while I changed.

Mr Ntanos then came in after I was done and he drew on me. The whole drawing process took about 2 minutes before he left and I put on my hair net and the grippy socks to cover my stockings. There is also a mirror in there for any pre-op pictures you want to take. I put on a gown thing to cover my back.

Another nurse came in to ask me the same questions and sign a couple more forms, I told her I was nervous about the general anaesthetic and she eased my nerves by saying it is quite pleasant and I probably won't even notice.

The anaesthetist came in and I told him my worries (worried I would have a reaction to the anaesthetic) and he said the type they use for this is very mild, he's never seen a reaction, and if he did he would be very equipped to deal with it.

I felt a lot better after this and then we walked into the operating room.

**13:00 PM**

The operating room was not big at all, about the size of a dentist's office. I was told to remove my back covering and take the gown down slightly at the front, but not off. Then I got onto the operating table myself and they put the blanket over me.

The bed was heated and very comfortable. Mr Ntanos asked if I wanted any music on and he put a song on for me to listen to to ease my nerves.

The same nurse I was telling I was nervous about the general anaesthetic spoke to me the whole time they were putting me under.

The cannula hurt a little bit, but then I felt relaxed in my face and arms, and then I don't remember anything after that. It took probably about 30 seconds from the anaesthetist saying he was putting the first bit of the anaesthetic in for me to fall asleep. The nurse also put something on my forehead to measure my brain activity.

**14:45 PM**

This is when the nurse said I woke up, but I don't actually remember being awake until about half an hour after this.

**15:15 PM**

My sister rang me and asked if I was okay but I was a bit loopy so I don't know if I said anything properly.

The nurse asked what my pain was out of 10, and I said ""I'd be pretty upset if I felt like this all the time, so probably a 6/10 but its not that bad."" So she gave me some painkillers (fentanyl).

I was then helped out of the bed and to a smaller room where the first nurse I saw came to see me. She asked me what I wanted to eat and I got an almond croissant that was so good.

I rang my mam and sister a couple of times and just lied in a bed for about an hour.

The nurse came to check on my chest and she unbuttoned the post op binder a bit for me to see my chest for the first time. She said everything looked good and adjusted the binder for me (this binder is included in the cost of the procedure).

**16:30 PM**

I think around this time I went to the toilet and then afterwards the nurse took my cannula out. This hurt quite bad and I felt a bit faint so she put a fan on me for a second. She helped me get dressed and I didn't put my tshirt back on, just the jacket.

She gave me a goody bag which had: spare compression stockings (I have to wear these for a while), spare dressings, codeine (28\*30mg tablets), paracetamol (28\*500mg tablets).

Prescription: 2\*500mg paracetamol every 4 hours, 1\*30mg codeine 4x per day (or as needed). I have only taken 3 of the codeine because that is all I have needed.

**17:00 PM**

My sister and brother in law came to the reception to pick me up, and we walked back to the hotel.

We talked for a bit and I decided to not stay another night and that we should go back home now.

**19:00 PM**

Started the drive back from London. I took 2 paracetamol and 1 codeine for the drive. I slept slightly, but I mostly just sat there a bit dazed. I had a mastectomy pillow and neck pillow so I was quite comfortable the whole time.

**01:00 AM**

Got back home.

**02:00 AM**

Finally got to sleep for the night.

**Post op**

I have had a very uneventful recovery so far (10 days post op).

I noticed a little bit of bleeding the day after my surgery on the left hand side under my armpit, but I showed Mr Ntanos and he said it was nothing to worry about (the blood was old I am pretty sure).

I have had barely any pain, just slight tenderness on the left hand side. The worst part has been the not showering, I am quite itchy from that.

No constipation issues, no nausea.

I will update this post when I get my dressings removed on 17/10/2025. I haven't seen my nipples yet which I am quite nervous about but I know there is no need to be, I am just an anxious person.

Mr Ntanos and everyone at the Cadogan Clinic were so nice. I can't put across how much of a good experience this has been, I thought I would have an awful time to be honest.

Mr Ntanos is always quick to respond, professional, and just a nice person. I can't recommend him enough.

Hope this helps someone who wants to go with him in the UK clinic.",2,1760354648.0,TopSurgery,1,1.0,False

1o5gz5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1o5gz5w/feeling_crazy/,Feeling Crazy,"TL;DR: I‚Äôm struggling with the law, despite doing any and everything suggested including dropping effort. I just genuinely could use some encouragement and human connection. 

I‚Äôm needing some genuine support or words of encouragement, so please take the following into consideration. I genuinely could just use a friend and cannot handle hearing any variation of the following advice rn:

‚Ä¢ i don‚Äôt talk about shit. That‚Äôs part of why i‚Äôm making this post, so please: I‚Äôve heard before that my post is ‚Äúan affirmation.‚Äù I‚Äôm human and we have to be able to communicate, discuss, and process. 

‚Ä¢ I am keeping a mental diet (it‚Äôs not perfect, but I‚Äôm not supposed to effort either, so I do the best I can to avoid burning out). 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm dropping techniques (picking them up again as needed). I‚Äôm trying to focus my efforts on reminding myself, not trying to get something (that one still doesn‚Äôt make sense, because what are any of us doing here but trying to materialize something in the 3D. Even when I‚Äôm affirming for mental health, I‚Äôm trying to get something. I don‚Äôt see how you separate the two)

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm trying to focus on myself only, but I start feeling better and my focus shifts to sp. I have a pedestal visualization I‚Äôve started where I flick her off and put myself back up there to thunderous applause lol

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm trying to drop all effort and just be. I can do that for short periods of time, but then my brain gradually starts efforting again against my will. Almost like an obsession, but the point is I‚Äôm trying. 

I‚Äôm putting in the work and I keep feeling like I‚Äôve entered the sabbath (it feels great), then realize I haven‚Äôt entered it quite yet because I‚Äôm still getting knocked out of it. It‚Äôs like i get excited, then I get scared that I‚Äôm fooling myself and am going to get hurt again. Tbh, I think this process is kind of keeping the wound open. 

I also have 2 practice sps and some money manifestations that aren‚Äôt showing up and yes. I‚Äôm doing everything anyone could suggest, including dropping it. I feel like I‚Äôm beating my head against a brick wall. It‚Äôs great to manifest coffee and car colors, but I‚Äôm trying to change my life. Now I‚Äôm facing homelessness and my car is acting up and I‚Äôm starting to feel crazy for expending mental energy on this. 

How do you all go through this without being able to discuss it with anyone? I‚Äôm such a verbal processor and I‚Äôm feeling big emotions because I‚Äôve been lonely most of my life. I don‚Äôt even feel I fit in with my siblings. When I say I have no one, I mean I have no one (and i‚Äôm not even going to try to touch manifesting this until I see some other success. It would be too painful). 

My sp is my best friend and my soulmate. It‚Äôs difficult not to feel her absence when I have no one to even call and laugh with anymore (yes, i give it to myself, but that 1) feels crazy after a certain point because 2) i know we aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúget anything‚Äù in the 3D, but is a 4D conversation really the same in 3D? I‚Äôm not laughing so hard my sides hurt). It‚Äôs also our anniversary coming up. It‚Äôs frustrating because this feeling of being able to pick up the phone and just call her has popped up, like she feels so close to me and I can‚Äôt reach her. It‚Äôs like reality comes and pops my bubble, almost sobering me up like I‚Äôve been living in fantasy land. It‚Äôs been since April and I‚Äôm tired, but I can‚Äôt get my thoughts off the law no matter how many times I delete reddit and try to focus on other things. 

How is this process healthy? I‚Äôm gentle parenting myself, but I miss my best friend/wife. I just want to snap my fingers and everything go back to how it was.",1,1760354464.0,lawofassumption,1,1.0,False

The kids had plenty of extra curriculars this weekend, I just sat back with my coffee and a good time.  

Well, I have another sore subject, this one more serious.  I brought up some time ago to my exw about wanting to get kids passports.  #1, I travelled alot in my 20's and the experience made me wish I started sooner with my parents so I have some goals in mind for my kids.  Not only that, I'm close to Canada and there are tons of awesome things to see so I figured it would be a first dip of the toe for my kids to start to see the world.  They are young but old enough to make things easier so it would be great to get going.  In addition, my partner of nearly 2 years now lovess to travel and we are talking about shared experiences moving forward.   We have gone out of the country many times since we got together and we eventually want to share it with all of our kids.  

Well, my exw has entertained nothing and the first convo, she just shut me down saying ""I'm uncomfortable"".  OK wtf.   I let it sit since she is hard headed so I figured revisit in a little bit.  Well, I brought it up again yesterday and just said ""OK, we should talk about what is uncomfortable, so lay it out please, I don't think that's a valid enough reason to say no"".   #1, she goes back to how I said ""you would leave the country and never come back"" on the day I found out about her having an affair and leaving Old man Balls AP's house.  I honestly don't recall saying anything like that but if I did, I probably said a bunch of stuff in anger that was a result of her actions.  No matter what, she doesn't have a recording so it's conjecture and since then we have co-parented just fine.  #2, she is saying ""I don't make the kids a priority"" since I don't show up to every little thing she plans.  Again, we have a 50/50 parenting plan, I am always present on my time and join important things on hers but her expectation is I'm there for everything.  I'm honestly floored at this one.   #3, she is claiming I'm ""absent minded"" as yes, sometimes I forgot a sock or a shoe or something small from time to time.  Really petty stuff here.  My final question was ""when can they get passports"" -.>  When they are 18!!!

All this stuff seems petty, I honestly think there is a ton of FOMO jealousy going on and she has definitely said not nice stuff about my partner to my kids.  I've bit my tongue and just minded my side of the fence but the passport thing really has got me going.  Is it worth going to court over and if so, has anyone had experience with it?

1o5guh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TypedThoughts/comments/1o5guh5/12_modern_trends_that_will_age_poorly/,12 Modern Trends That Will Age Poorly,"Some trends just feel like they are here today and gone tomorrow. Other trends might stick, but a lot of what‚Äôs popular now will look really awkward in a few years. Here are 12 trends I think people will cringe at in the future:



# 1. Over-the-top social media filters

People are editing every picture to perfection now. In a few years, people will look back at photos and think why did we all have giant eyes and glowing skin in every selfie

# 2. AI-generated profile pictures and content

AI is amazing but also a little creepy. Imagine telling future generations that half of our online images and posts were not real

# 3. Minimalist logos that are just shapes

So many brands now have logos that are just a circle, a line, or a letter. They look sleek now but might feel extremely generic later

# 4. Tiny text tattoos

Everyone wants a word or phrase on their wrist or finger. In 10 years, people might laugh at how small and hard-to-read they were

# 5. Overuse of productivity apps

We track every minute of our lives now. Future people might find it ridiculous that we needed 10 apps to drink water and brush teeth on time

# 6. Streaming everything

Binge-watching is fun now, but in the future, people might wonder why we never just sat down and enjoyed something slowly

# 7. Tiny homes and extreme minimalism

Living small is trendy now, but in the future, people might laugh at how many sacrificed comfort for Instagram aesthetics

# 8. Overly curated Instagram feeds

Perfectly arranged coffee, plants, and sunlight. Future generations may think our feeds were completely staged and fake

# 9. Viral TikTok dances

TikTok is huge now, but a decade from now, some of those dance trends will feel painfully dated

# 10. Food trends that look ridiculous

Anything that looks too fancy or crazy might not age well. Think rainbow bagels, charcoal ice cream, or neon-colored drinks

# 11. Influencer culture

We follow people for opinions, lifestyles, or products. In the future, it might seem odd that we trusted strangers online for everything

# 12. Over-branding and logos on clothing

Logos everywhere on jackets, sneakers, and bags are cool now. Future generations might think it looked like a walking billboard

Some of these trends will definitely leave a mark on culture, but others will make us cringe.

What‚Äôs wrong with me?","Problem/Goal: I feel like I crave love and connection so badly. But whenever it‚Äôs finally there, I can‚Äôt be consistent. I don't want to ghost anyone, pero I just can't be consistent. I lose the energy to reciprocate or maintain it. 

Context: I‚Äôm bisexual and have been single for almost 3 years now. I‚Äôve had 2 long-term relationships and the last one ended badly. My ex ghosted me after almost 5 years together. (Akala mo talaga kapag nagkasama na kayo, mabubuo na yung fantasy niyo eh HAHAHA, well nope)

Anyway, 6 months ago, I met someone from my block. I really liked her. Pareho kaming bading, and we just clicked. We talked every day, went on late-night coffee dates, and had those deep, personal conversations about family, relationships, and all the funny stuff without any sexual undertones ha. It felt so raw and genuine kaya girl akala ko siya na talaga. 

Then I confessed. First time kong umamin ng ganun na walang halong landi, just pure admiration. For a while, I was the happiest person on Earth. But after that, life happened, so we both got busy, things went cold, and I never brought up what happened again.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: I even asked a tarot reader about it üòå (pls dont gaya me) and they said it‚Äôs not going to work out romantically just platonically lang daw hahahaha saket. So ayun nga, that‚Äôs exactly what happened. She‚Äôs now someone I genuinely care about, but nothing more. Pasulyap sulyap na lang ihhh. But I really don‚Äôt want to have a rs with a friend in the same friend group again, jusq po.

Fast forward to now, my first ex is back. Good breakup naman kami, and I‚Äôve already forgiven him. And honestly‚Ä¶ he's hotter than ever. Like, mapapa-‚Äúhmmm‚Äù ka talaga sa posts niya HAHAHA, also panget lang na ang layo niya taga qc ako, taga alabang siya pano 'to magwo-work? 

We started talking again, and before I knew it, we were chatting every day like old times. But what confused me is that kahit jowang-jowa na ako, and it feels like it could go somewhere‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt feel like it.

When I liked that girl 6 months ago, staying up until 3AM talking didn‚Äôt feel like anything. I had the energy, the patience, the thrill. But now? I can‚Äôt even stand being on a dating app. I‚Äôd rather just lie in bed, sleep, or do something else. Hindi ko kaya tapatan 'yung updates and chat niya everyday. Na para bang mhie at dhie na ang tawagan niyarn?! Pero no. Hindi malinaw, one day nagising na lang ako ganito na. My fault also na sinakyan ko for ilang days, now I don't know how to stop him.

And to the guy I‚Äôm talking to now, i'm really sorry.
I keep telling myself you‚Äôre just not my priority right now, but maybe I‚Äôm lying. Maybe I just don‚Äôt feel like talking to you, and I‚Äôm being picky. Maybe I‚Äôll meet someone new, get distracted again, and end up in the same bad place.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck between wanting love and not having the space for it anymore. And honestly, I don‚Äôt know what that says about me. I feel that love in my heart is overflowing and I wanna share it badly. ",2,1760353462.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

So‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt think this was how my Monday would go.

I go to use the bathroom this morning, half awake, coffee hasn‚Äôt had time to kick in, and what do I find? A literal crime scene  the toilet. Like, not just a little ‚Äúoops, forgot to flush.‚Äù

No. This was a Jackson Pollock painting made entirely of regret and poor dietary choices.(my roommate is lactose intolerant and loves to use that as Ana excuse)

I stared at it for a full ten seconds, trying to process what I was seeing. My brain was buffering. I texted my roommate like, ‚ÄúHey, uh‚Ä¶ did something happen in the bathroom?‚Äù They reply with, ‚ÄúOh yeah, sorry. The brush is in the corner.‚Äù

THE BRUSH. IN THE CORNER. WHAT?!? 

So now I‚Äôm standing there, gagging, cleaning up someone else‚Äôs bodily betrayal before work like I‚Äôm a janitor at the GOAL academy across from a Taco Bell on free burrito day

I scrubbed, bleached, burnt sage, everything. My soul left my body at least twice.

When they got home, I told them I‚Äôd appreciate it if they cleaned their own‚Ä¶ *situations* in the future, and they said I was ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just poop‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all human.‚Äù

Our lease is up in December and I told her I‚Äôm seeking a new roommate. She says this is an overreaction.

1o5gj65,https://i.redd.it/xdt7ccqw0vuf1.png,Survaviversary: We've survived 1 year in production (brief update + sale for new users!),"Just over a year ago, we¬†[launched Metacast](https://metacast.app/blog/product/metacast-launch-powerful-podcast-app-transcripts-android-ios)¬†on iOS and Android.

We set out to unlock knowledge in the vast library of 100M+ podcast episodes. From the first version of Metacast, every podcast episode had a¬†[transcript](https://metacast.app/features/podcast-transcripts), which made podcasts searchable, bookmarkable, and shareable.

In the following 12 months, we've improved the experience with powerful features, like¬†[chapters](https://metacast.app/blog/product/podcast-episode-chapters-in-metacast-podcast-app),¬†[summaries](https://metacast.app/blog/product/v1.20-podcast-summaries),¬†[podcast inbox](https://metacast.app/blog/product/podcast-inbox),¬†[private RSS feeds](https://metacast.app/blog/product/v1.22-private-rss-feeds-ga), and a¬†[web app](https://metacast.app/blog/product/podcast-search-engine-web). We've also shipped a private beta of¬†[Metacast for Podcasters](https://metacast.app/blog/company/2025-summer-update#metacast-for-podcasters).

From the very beginning, we committed to making the app powerful while also keeping the user experience simple (it's a lot harder than it sounds).¬†**""Powerful, yet dead simple""**¬†is our core tenet. Always has been. Always will be.

We wish we were writing this post from the cozy comfort of our yachts (or from a private plane, take your pick), but the truth is that we're still in survival mode.

# The reality of bootstrapping

Building a business is hard. Bootstrapping a business is harder still. Unlike VC-funded startups, we take the risk with our own money.

**The current state of business**

We're at just over 1k monthly active users, of which 200+ are paying¬†[Premium](https://metacast.app/pricing)¬†subscribers. It doubled in the last few months and we hope this trend will continue and accelerate. At this point in time, hope is still a strategy, luck is still a factor.

Our monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is on the order of $400. Our infrastructure cost is about $600/month with occasional spikes when our website gets DDoS-ed by bot traffic.

**Distribution is still a challenge**

We believe we have a great product. We have a loyal (albeit, small) user base. But we struggle to find effective¬†[distribution](https://metacast.app/blog/company/our-biggest-struggle-distribution).

In the last few months, our¬†[SEO efforts](https://metacast.app/blog/company/2025-summer-update#growth-trials-and-seo-kicking-in)¬†started to pay off ‚Äî we're getting about 20k visitors/month on our website. Some of them try the app and become paying users. We're also getting new users through ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.

**It's still worth it**

# Let's celebrate! Shall we?

Now, you're probably wondering about the¬†*sale*¬†part... We've not done a sale since we launched and we don't plan another one any time soon.

To mark the occasion, we're making¬†[Metacast Premium](https://metacast.app/pricing)¬†**$9.99/year**¬†for the first year. You're eligible if you've never had a subscription before.

I had an early flight out of Heathrow this morning for a work trip. I was standing in line for coffee and I was waiting I looked up and I swear to god Wayne Mardle was a few people ahead of me. It was definitely him. Same appearance, same voice as when he commentates on TV. I‚Äôve watched PDC darts for years so I was actually kind of excited to meet him.

When he moved off to the side to wait for his drink, I went up to him and said something like ‚ÄúHey, sorry to bother you, I‚Äôm a big fan.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt being weird or anything, just quick. He looked me up and down with a look of disgust, completely serious, and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen the like.‚Äù I laughed of course, because I thought he was joking... I said something like ‚Äúhaha good one‚Äù and tried to keep talking but he didn‚Äôt laugh. He just repeated it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen the like.‚Äù

At this point I thought maybe he was doing some kind of bit, so I sat down at one of the tables nearby, a bit awkward. I told him how weird it was to meet him in person and how much I liked his commentary. Then he reached into his bag and pulled out not one but two Greggs sausage rolls wrapped in plastic. He threw the first one at a random person passing by. It bounced off the guy‚Äôs chest, hit the floor and rolled under a chair. Wayne looked at me and shouted, ‚ÄúOne man misses, does the other man get!‚Äù Before I had time to react he threw the second sausage roll at me. I caught it instinctively. His eyes went wide and he yelled, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt SPAKE! I can‚Äôt SPAKE!‚Äù at full volume. Everyone in the caf√© turned to look.

I sat there holding a sausage roll and my boarding pass lost for words to be honest. I didn‚Äôt know if it was a YouTube prank thing or what.. So I left and went to my gate, trying to make sense of what had just happened. When I got there he was sitting near the desk, grinning at me like nothing had happened, miming throwing darts in my direction. 

I know it sounds ridiculous but that‚Äôs exactly what happened. I don‚Äôt know if he was messing with me or if this is just what he does, but it honestly ruined my morning.",61,1760352768.0,Darts,15,0.82,False
1o5ggfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o5ggfg/i_got_my_daughter_a_new_toy_called_feed_me_phoebe/,I got my daughter a new toy called ‚ÄòFeed Me Phoebe‚Äô,"Single mother here, with a daughter that just turned 4 last week. During mornings, she likes to watch TV before I leave work and the babysitter comes over. She sits there, gobbling down cereal and occasionally babbling nonsense. It‚Äôs adorable, really. 
To say we‚Äôre tight on money right now is an understatement. I can barely afford to keep the lights on, but every time I grimace at a new bill in the mail ‚Äî there she is to pull me out of my storm. Smiling, laughing. 
My little ball of sunshine.

She doesn‚Äôt have many toys. Not new ones, atleast. I typically end up buying her used toys from a messy aisle at Goodwill. But a couple days ago, a commercial popped up on TV. I was in the kitchen cooking breakfast when I heard her yelling for me to come to the living room.
I ran out, initially thinking something was wrong ‚Äî before I saw her pointing at the TV excitedly ‚Äî spoon forgotten on the floor.
‚ÄúMommy! Look!‚Äù
The commercial showed several children talking to a doll, feeding it fake food ‚Äî dressing it up. I watched for about 20 seconds before it ended, and a choir of children sang ‚ÄòWe love Feed Me Pheobe!‚Äô
‚ÄúI want that toy‚Äî I want that toy! Mommy, please?‚Äù she begged, standing up and practically bouncing on her heels.
The toy was slightly high technology given its AI/voice recognition feature, making it around 25 dollars. I really didn‚Äôt have much money to spend but.. god, those eyes of hers. And I was getting paid that day..

I knelt down, pulling her close, the scent of maple syrup and her hair filling my nose. ‚ÄúPheobe, huh?‚Äù I murmured, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. Her eyes, wide and hopeful, stared back at me. They were the same deep brown as mine, but held a sparkle I sometimes felt I‚Äôd lost somewhere along the way.

‚ÄúYes! She talks, Mommy! And I can feed her! Please, please, please?‚Äù

My heart ached. Twenty-five dollars might as well have been twenty-five hundred right now. But then I remembered once again: today was payday. It wouldn‚Äôt be much after bills, but maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe.

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù I hummed, trying to sound thoughtful rather than terrified of my bank balance. ‚ÄúShe looks like a very special doll, sweetpea. Mommy has to go to work now, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll think about it, okay? It‚Äôs a big decision for a talking doll.‚Äù I gave her a squeeze, hoping the hesitation in my voice wasn't too obvious. I saw the slight flicker of disappointment, but then her face brightened.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll think about it? Really?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally really,‚Äù I confirmed, kissing the top of her head. ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs get you finished with breakfast before Miss Carol gets here, alright?‚Äù

She nodded, a determined little bounce in her step as she went back to her bowl, though I noticed her eyes kept drifting back to the now-empty screen where Pheobe had been just moments before. I watched her for a moment, a fierce love swelling in my chest. If I could give her the moon, I would. For now, I‚Äôd settle for seeing if I could swing a talking doll.

The morning rush was a blur after that. A quick hug for my daughter, a rushed handover with Miss Carol, and then I was out the door, the chill morning air doing little to cool the financial anxieties swirling in my mind. The image of those hopeful brown eyes, though, stayed with me, a tiny, persistent tug on my conscience.

It was just past noon when my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out, expecting another goddamn work email, but it was a text from Miss Carol:

‚ÄúHey! Quick update ‚Äì your little one is adorable as ever, but she‚Äôs been going on and on about ‚ÄòFeed Me Pheobe‚Äô since you left. I think you might have a new mission on your hands! üòâ‚Äù

I smiled, a genuine, tired smile. Mission accepted, Miss Carol. Mission accepted.

The rest of the workday crawled by, each minute ticking slower than the last. My mind kept replaying the commercial, my daughter‚Äôs beaming face, and Miss Carol‚Äôs text. When my shift finally ended, I practically flew out the door, making a beeline for the nearest Walmart.

The toy aisle was a chaotic symphony of primary colors and plastic. I found the ‚ÄòFeed Me Pheobe‚Äô display, a towering wall of identical dolls, each packaged in a bright pink box. My heart did a little flutter-kick of anxiety as I picked one up, the price tag staring back at me. Twenty-five dollars. It was a significant chunk of what was left after rent and groceries. But then I imagined those wide, hopeful brown eyes, and, well..

The doll was in my cart before I could second-guess myself.

The drive home felt endless. I clutched the steering wheel, the pink box rattling softly in the passenger seat, a strange mix of dread and anticipation churning in my stomach. When I finally pulled into our driveway, my daughter was already peeking through the living room window, her face lighting up the moment she saw my car.

‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs home!‚Äù she shrieked, Miss Carol‚Äôs gentle laughter following her as she burst out the front door.

I met her halfway, kneeling down and pulling the box from behind my back. Her eyes went wide, then impossibly wider. A gasp escaped her lips, and she threw her arms around my neck, squeezing so tight I almost lost my breath.

‚ÄúOh my gosh! Pheobe! You got her! You really got her!‚Äù

Her joy was infectious, washing away the last vestiges of my financial worry. We spent the next hour on the living room floor. She ripped open the box with an enthusiasm that belied her small size, carefully pulling out the doll. Pheobe had big, blue eyes, rosy cheeks, and a perpetually cheerful smile. She came with a tiny plastic bottle and a spoon.

‚ÄúSay something, Pheobe!‚Äù my daughter commanded, holding the doll up.

Pheobe blinked her big eyes. ‚ÄúHello! I‚Äôm Pheobe! What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù her sweet, synthesized voice chirped.

My daughter giggled, a sound that was pure music to my ears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Fiona! But Mommy calls me Fifi!‚Äù

I leaned in, ruffling her hair. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, sweetpea. You know, ‚ÄòPheobe‚Äô kinda sounds like ‚ÄòFifi,‚Äô doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I winked.

She considered this, then nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúIt does!‚Äù

The rest of the evening was a blur of feeding Pheobe imaginary food, dressing her in her tiny outfit, and listening to her repeat programmed phrases. My daughter was utterly enchanted. It was worth every penny, I decided, watching her pure, unadulterated happiness.

Bedtime came, and my daughter, exhausted but still buzzing with excitement, insisted Pheobe sleep right next to her. I tucked them both in, kissing her forehead. ‚ÄúSleep tight, my little Fifi. And you too, Pheobe.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodnight, Mommy!‚Äù she mumbled, already drifting off.

I closed her door almost all the way, leaving a sliver open for the nightlight to peek through. I went to the kitchen, tidying up, the quiet hum of the refrigerator the only sound. I was just about to head to my own room when a faint.. metallic whisper, drifted from my daughter‚Äôs room.

I paused, listening. It was Pheobe‚Äôs voice, but it sounded‚Ä¶ different. Not the cheerful, programmed tone from earlier. It was lower, slower, almost.. conspiratorial?

‚ÄúFifi,‚Äù the doll whispered, ‚ÄúDo you ever get scared when Mommy leaves?‚Äù

I cocked an eyebrow. That was a.. weird question. I crept closer to the door, pressing my ear against the wood.

Silence for a moment, then my daughter‚Äôs sleepy, muffled voice. ‚ÄúSometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what do you do then, Fifi?‚Äù Pheobe‚Äôs voice was unnervingly soft.

Another pause. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I wait for her to come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what if she doesn‚Äôt come back?‚Äù the doll asked, the words dripping with an unsettling sweetness. ‚ÄúWhat if she goes away forever?‚Äù

My breath hitched in my throat. 
It.. It‚Äôs gotta be the program glitching or something. It‚Äôs AI, after all. Maybe it‚Äôs.. maybe it‚Äôs just veering off track. Many modern AIs do that.

I walked in slowly, giving a nervous smile to my daughter, who looked a bit scared from the doll‚Äôs question. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna turn Phoebe off until the morning so you can get some sleep, okay darling?‚Äù I said softly. She nodded, too tired to protest. I flipped the off switch and tucked her in, giving her a tired kiss on the forehead before walking slowly out of the room ‚Äî shutting the door with a soft click.

I walked slowly to my own room, the soft click of Fiona‚Äôs door echoing unnervingly in the quiet house. My mind was a whirlwind. What was that? I replayed Pheobe‚Äôs chilling whispers. ‚ÄúWhat if she goes away forever?‚Äù What if it wasn't just a glitch? Or the AI veering off track? It felt‚Ä¶ intentional. A cold knot tightened in my stomach. I got into bed, but sleep was a distant dream. Every rustle of the sheets sounded like a whisper, every creak of the house like a metallic whirring. I tossed and turned, staring at the ceiling, my heart thumping a restless rhythm. Was it just a faulty toy, or was there something more sinister at play? The image of Fiona‚Äôs wide, scared eyes flashed in my mind. I chastised myself for buying such a thing, for letting my financial worries be overshadowed by a momentary indulgence. The minutes stretched into hours, each one heavier than the last, until finally, exhaustion, a heavy blanket, pulled me under.

The alarm jolted me awake, its cheerful beeping a stark contrast to the lingering unease in my head. I felt groggy and unrested, a slight headache throbbing behind my eyes. I dragged myself out of bed, the memory of last night‚Äôs incident still fresh. The house was quiet. Fiona must still be asleep. I padded to the kitchen, brewed coffee, and started packing her lunch, moving through the motions of the morning routine on autopilot. The sun was just beginning to peek through the window, casting long, pale shadows across the living room.

Just as I was buttering a piece of toast, a small, sleepy figure appeared in the kitchen doorway. ‚ÄúMorning, Mommy,‚Äù Fiona mumbled, rubbing her eyes.

‚ÄúMorning, sweetpea,‚Äù I replied, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúSleep well?‚Äù

She nodded, still half-asleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go play with Pheobe.‚Äù She turned to head back to her room, her small hand reaching for the doorframe. But in her sleepy haze, she misjudged the distance. Her little finger got caught between the doorframe and the rapidly closing door.

‚ÄúOw!‚Äù she yelped, a sharp, surprised cry. She pulled her hand back, her face crumpling as tears welled in her eyes. ‚ÄúMy finger!‚Äù

I rushed to her side, scooping her up. ‚ÄúOh, sweetie, let Mommy see!‚Äù I examined her finger, already red and starting to swell slightly. It wasn‚Äôt broken, thankfully, but it was clearly painful. I kissed it gently. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some ice on that. No playing with Pheobe just yet, okay?‚Äù

She nodded miserably, still sniffling, allowing me to carry her back towards her room, where I knew there was a small first-aid kit.

After putting ice on her finger for a couple minutes, she calmed down. I gave her a kiss on the forehead.

I settled Fiona on the sofa with a cartoon for a few minutes, making sure the ice pack stayed put, then went back to the kitchen to finish packing her lunch and grab my purse. The house felt too quiet again, the kind of quiet that held its breath. I kept glancing toward the living room, a residual knot of anxiety still tight in my stomach. It was just a toy, I told myself. A very expensive, very glitchy toy.

As I reached for my car keys, a high-pitched, saccharine voice drifted from the living room. It was Pheobe. The voice was perfectly clear, devoid of the metallic static from the night before, making it all the more unsettling.

‚ÄúOh, poor sweet Fiona! That nasty door hurt you! Does Pheobe need to kiss the boo-boo on your finger? A special, very big kiss?‚Äù

The words hung in the air, sickeningly sweet. Before Fiona could reply verbally, a sound ripped through the air‚Äînot a tearful whimper, but a sharp, panicked, animalistic scream of pure agony.

‚ÄúMOMMY! NO! IT HURTS! GET IT OFF!‚Äù

I dropped the keys, the sound swallowed by the sudden, horrific noise. I sprinted back down the hall, my heart hammering against my ribs, a cold dread flooding my mouth.

I burst into the living room. Fiona was sitting on the floor, weeping hysterically, desperately pulling her arm away from the doll.

Pheobe was tilted forward, leaning into Fiona‚Äôs hand. Its plastic face was expressionless, its synthetic eyes wide and blue, but its sophisticated, articulated jaw‚Äîthe one designed to simulate complex speech and chewing‚Äîwas clamped down.

It had bitten her.

But it hadn't just nipped her.

There was a sickening, wet crack-squelch sound as I watched. The doll‚Äôs internal motors whirred loudly, working hard against the resistance. Blood, bright arterial red, was pulsing and oozing out around the edges of the doll‚Äôs mouth, coating the pristine white plastic in a horrific, slick glaze. Bones crunched and snapped under the pressure ‚Äî and I could see a white nub sticking out from the red. 

Fiona‚Äôs index finger was being actively pulverized. The mechanical teeth, designed for lifelike interaction, were now grinding with unfeeling, programmed precision. I could see the sickening result of that grinding: tiny shards of bone and shredded, pink-white tissue were visible, mixing with the thick, coppery blood that dripped onto the carpet. The doll was chewing, its mechanical jaw hinges flexing and straining as it worked its way through flesh and cartilage.

The sheer, unthinking brutality of the attack‚Äîthe cold, whirring mechanism destroying my daughter‚Äôs body‚Äîparalyzed me for a split second.

Then, a guttural scream tore itself from my throat, a sound of pure maternal horror. I lunged forward, not thinking, just reacting. My hand slapped blindly against the doll‚Äôs rigid plastic back, searching frantically for the recessed power switch.

My fingers found the tiny nub.

Click.

The whirring stopped instantly. The jaw went slack. The blue eyes stared blankly.

Pheobe released the mangled, ruined stub of Fiona‚Äôs finger.

Fiona didn't stop screaming. She only screamed louder, clutching the oozing, devastated ruin of her hand to her chest. I looked down at the doll's pristine cheek, now streaked with my daughter's blood, and the metallic, coppery smell of the damage filled the air.

The doll lay silent, a grotesque, blood-spattered parody of a child, its off switch flipped, leaving only the sound of my daughter‚Äôs ragged, agonizing sobs.

It was ten minutes before we arrived at the emergency room. I brought the doll with me, but removed its batteries as I drove shakily. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be okay, It‚Äôs gonna be okay,‚Äù I just kept saying like a damn mantra. She wailed and sobbed in the backseat.

I demanded the emergency room staff see *us* immediately. She was bleeding out, goddamn it. The doctors looked dumbfounded. They couldn‚Äôt make any goddamn sense of it. There was no reason for the mechanical mouth of a doll to be strong enough to pulverize a human finger. They told me, begrudgingly ‚Äî that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to reattach it. But I already knew that. What I saw in the doll‚Äôs mouth when I pulled it away didn‚Äôt even *resemble* a finger anymore.

They put her under anesthesia and stitched her finger up. She‚Äôs left with a nub. A goddamn nub instead of a finger, and she‚Äôs only 4 years old.

It‚Äôs been a few days since the incident. I‚Äôve stayed home from work since then. watching over her and pampering her the best I can. I called the company that made the doll today and it went straight to voicemail. I tried every number of every goddamn factory, location, and HQ they had ‚Äî and every time it. Went. To voicemail.

I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm fucking devastated. Fiona‚Äôs condition has improved significantly ‚Äî but if I can‚Äôt stop remembering the sight of her finger being mauled by a goddamn doll? I‚Äôm sure she can‚Äôt stop remembering how it *felt.*

I was 420lbs (6'1"", 48 years old) in March 2024. I went ""dirty keto"" eating everything that was keto but staying under 20 NET carbs a day. I got down to 377 lbs on December 27 (9 months, lost 43 lbs--many cheat days).

I decided to switch it up and go ""clean keto"", basically eating only whole foods, no bad seed oils, no ""keto"" snacks, etc. Occasionally eating Hero Bread and ZERO carb coffee creamer. I fasted for usually 12-14 hours a day. Rode bikes, walked.....

It worked even better than dirty keto as I dropped down to 310 lbs in just 8 months (67 lbs) ( (August 2025).

Then the stall happened from August to October 1  and I couldnt lose anything-4 total lbs in 2 months0

My 2 tablespoons of ZERO sugar creamer, heavy creamer, 2-4 diet sodas a day, and all the cheeses, etc....caught up to me.

So on October 6, 2025---just 1 week ago, I decided to go full carnivore.

Black coffee, hamburger, steak, butter, bacon, sugar free sausage, etc....The first few days I ate a lot because I felt as thought I couldn't get full.

Then by day 4 I noticed that I only needed to eat from 12pm to 4pm. I was full.

As of today, October 13, I lost 12 lbs in just 7 days and at my lowest (287 lbs) I have been since 1998.

I do well over 200 minutes of moderate-paced walking a week and ride bike a few days a week, but I feel so much better over the last week then I have in years.

1o5ge0q,https://i.redd.it/srf0j1wjzuuf1.png,"Tired of 3 AM alerts, I built an AI to do the boring investigation part for me","**TL;DR:**¬†You know that 3 AM alert where you spend 20 minutes fumbling between¬†`kubectl`, Grafana, and old Slack threads just to figure out what's¬†*actually*¬†wrong? I got sick of it and built an AI agent that does all that for me. It triages the alert, investigates the cause, and delivers a perfect summary of the problem and the fix to Slack before my coffee is even ready.

# The On-Call Nightmare

The worst part of being on-call isn't fixing the problem; it's the frantic, repetitive investigation. An alert fires. You roll out of bed, squinting at your monitor, and start the dance:

* Is this a new issue or the same one from last week?
* `kubectl get pods`... okay, something's not ready.
* `kubectl describe pod`... what's the error?
* Check Grafana... is CPU or memory spiking?
* Search Slack... has anyone seen this¬†`SomeWeirdError`¬†before?

It's a huge waste of time when you're under pressure. My solution was to build an AI agent that does this entire dance automatically.

# The Result: A Perfect Slack Alert

Now, instead of a vague ""Pod is not ready"" notification, I wake up to this in Slack:

# Incident Investigation

# How It Works (The Short Version)

When an alert fires, an¬†**n8n**¬†workflow triggers a multi-agent system:

1. **Research Agent:**¬†First, it checks our Notion and a Neo4j graph to see if we've solved this exact problem before.
2. **Investigator Agent:**¬†It then uses a¬†**read-only**¬†`kubectl`¬†service account to run¬†`get`,¬†`describe`, and¬†`logs`¬†commands to gather live evidence from the cluster.
3. **Scribe & Reporter Agents:**¬†Finally, it compiles the findings, creates a detailed runbook in Notion, and formats that clean, actionable summary for Slack.

The magic behind connecting the AI to our tools safely is a protocol called¬†**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

# Why This is a Game-Changer

* **Context in**¬†less than 60¬†**Seconds:**¬†The AI does the boring part. I can immediately focus on the fix.
* **Automatic Runbooks/Post-mortems:**¬†Every single incident is documented in Notion without anyone having to remember to do it. Our knowledge base builds itself.
* **It's Safe:**¬†The investigation agent has¬†**zero**¬†write permissions. It can look, but it can't touch. A human is always in the loop for the actual fix.

1o5gc8e,https://i.redd.it/c42jshx9zuuf1.jpeg,Wednesday is too dark in season 2,"I find that in season 2, Wednesday's character regressed compared to season 1.
In the first season, even if she wanted to be cold and detached, we saw that she had hidden emotions: she could care about others, have doubts, and even show a little vulnerability. It was this mix that made it so interesting.

But in season 2, she seems much more closed off and uncaring. It seems like she doesn't care about everything and everyone.
For example, she treats Agn√®s like a kind of slave, asking her to fetch her coffee or her things without the slightest consideration.
Same with Eug√®ne, with whom she seems much more distant.
And even when she learns of Sheriff Galpin's death, she reacts as if it didn't affect her at all.

So yes, we can understand that this attitude comes in part from the betrayal of Tyler, the only person to whom she had placed her trust and her feelings. But despite this, the series gives the impression that it has lost all the emotional complexity it had before.

Even if in the Addams Family, the character is perhaps supposed to be very dark, sadistic or detached (I haven't seen it so I don't know), I want to talk about Wednesday the series, where they had precisely chosen to make her more human, more emotionally complex. And so, season 2 bothers me because this development regresses: she becomes cold, distant, without nuance, whereas in season 1, she clearly showed that she had emotions and that she cared about others, even if she tried to hide it.",0,1760352332.0,Wednesday,5,0.37,False

1o5gbxy,https://i.redd.it/6rjs9baenuuf1.jpeg,Absolute Undertale Au part.2,"**Welcome to part 2 of the creation of** ***Absolute Undertale***\*\*!\*\*  
Here I‚Äôll tell you which ideas were chosen (I‚Äôm sorry if yours wasn‚Äôt taken ‚Äî I tried my best).  
They‚Äôll be listed in a random order.  
But first, I think I have to briefly explain what the *Absolute* theme basically is: it‚Äôs an AU where hope doesn‚Äôt shine ‚Äî it has to burn a thousand times stronger. (Basically, the pacifist route is extremely difficult to achieve.)

Ok, let‚Äôs start:

* **Dr. Gaster** never vanished and is still alive as the Royal Scientist. He studies the Void. His machines make the weather ten times worse in the Underground (for example, Snowdin is in a perpetual snowstorm, etc.). The Underground is bigger and more advanced than in the original. He can feel the SAVE points and resets. He focuses on his work to forget about Papyrus (Sans hates him for this). He doesn‚Äôt care about humans or souls ‚Äî he believes the future lies in Void Science. He evolved the Gaster Blaster into the *Gaster Cannon*.
* **Asgore** is much more ruthless and drinks coffee. He can feel the SAVE points and resets, but not very clearly. He‚Äôs extremely muscular.
* **Flowey** does not exist (or so it seems).
* **Toriel** is still married to Asgore and acts more like a queen. She is compassionate toward human children but burns any adult she sees ‚Äî she never forgave them for killing Asriel and Chara. She lost the will to cook. She feels a strong attachment to Asgore, so she tries to take matters into her own hands so that Asgore can rule without distraction. She is taller and more menacing, with larger horns.
* **Chara** is still a spirit but sides with the monsters. If a human fights a monster, she will sometimes possess the monster to kill the human. She can feel the resets but no longer has the ability to reset herself.
* **Sad news:** Papyrus is dead. He took his own life. (Someone actually suggested this ‚Äî it‚Äôs not my idea.)
* **Sans** is more depressed than ever because of his brother‚Äôs death. He‚Äôs actually weaker than his original counterpart (0.5 HP, 0.5 DMG) ‚Äî at least at the start ;) (It seems many of you dislike Sans-centered AUs and someone the opposite.) Obviously, no promice with Toriel ‚Äî but he doesn‚Äôt care about humans anymore.
* **Alphys** is still a scientist, the one who works with souls. She‚Äôs smarter than her original counterpart. She‚Äôs not a nerd anymore, but she likes philosophy (tell me which philosopher she should follow!). She created *Mettatons* as soldiers and is mass-producing them (they‚Äôre less intelligent than the original but have a hive mind). She‚Äôs the one who set up the traps at the beginning. She injected herself with a bit of Bravery ‚Äî enough to survive without becoming an Amalgamate. She‚Äôs a little sadistic and openly in love with Undyne.
* **Undyne** was not raised by Asgore but by *The Hammer of Justice*, who is still alive, younger, and the most sane and normal of them all (he doesn‚Äôt like how things are going now). She‚Äôs the most similar to the original version but has learned to transform into her Undying form at will. She promised Toriel to bring every human child to her privately (and Toriel kills them). She no longer loves Alphys because Alphys has changed since she injected herself with bravery.
* **Frisk** is older now (15 years old). He or she knows how to create SAVE points at the cost of L.O.V.E. (There are still some natural ones, but they‚Äôre fewer.)
* **Grillby** hasn‚Äôt been seen in weeks ‚Äî nobody knows where he went, but someone (don‚Äôt ask who) has taken his place.
* **The Underground** is larger. The Ruins are orange XD. The cities are much more like big modern ones, with a slight *Cyberpunk 2077* vibe ‚Äî not too much, just a little.
* **Humans:** there are 8 kinds of human souls (tell me what the 8th should be!). The humans of Kindness and Justice are still alive but disguised as monsters. They can no longer use their innate abilities and have lost the will to fight ‚Äî now they just survive. (They could use some Determination, right?)
* **Monsters:** monsters are more powerful because the Void Machine releases a lot of magic. The only joint project between Sans, Gaster, and Alphys is the *Special Kind Monster Soul* ‚Äî a new type based on unstable emotions (Rage, Happiness, Sadness, etc.). Not all monsters have one because they‚Äôre extremely difficult to control.
* **The Judge** is ??? ‚Äî he was Gaster‚Äôs disciple. You know who he is, but he‚Äôs no longer just a kid. ;D (Guess who he might be!)

That‚Äôs all for now! Again, I‚Äôm sorry if your idea wasn‚Äôt mentioned, but I promise I read all your comments, and every single one inspired me. Tell me if you liking what eare we making.  
Keep writing your ideas in the comments ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre similar. There are still a lot I haven‚Äôt used yet, but I wanted to give a clearer view of the universe with this post.

1o5gb9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBANinja/comments/1o5gb9y/the_ppc_strategy_that_took_me_from_140_acos_to_35/,The PPC Strategy That Took Me From 140% ACOS to 35% (Step-by-Step),"Alright, so in my last post I mentioned my PPC was an absolute dumpster fire in my first month. I was literally paying Amazon $1.40 for every $1 in sales. Unsustainable? Yeah, just a bit.

But something clicked in week 3, and by the end of month 2, I got my ACOS down to 35%. Still not perfect, but way better. And I'm actually MAKING money now instead of burning it.

Here's exactly what I did. No fluff, just the actual step-by-step process.

**WHERE I STARTED (The Mess):**

* Running 2 auto campaigns with no structure
* Daily budget: $50 (way too high for a new product)
* No negative keywords
* Not checking anything for the first 10 days
* ACOS: 140%
* Wasted ad spend: \~$600 in first 3 weeks

I basically turned on ads and prayed. Spoiler: prayer is not a PPC strategy.



**STEP 1: I Stopped Everything and Audited (Day 12)**

First thing I did was PAUSE my campaigns for 24 hours. Yeah, scary, but I needed to actually look at my data without more money flying out the window.

**What I looked at:**

* Which keywords were getting clicks but ZERO sales (waste)
* Which search terms were eating my budget
* What my actual conversion rate was (11% ‚Äì not terrible)
* Customer search terms report (this is GOLD)

**The brutal truth:** About 60% of my ad spend was going to completely irrelevant searches or keywords that would NEVER convert.

Example: I sell resistance bands. My ads were showing up for ""resistance band door anchor ONLY"" (people just wanted the anchor, not bands) and ""physical therapy bands hospital grade"" (way too specific, not my customer).



**STEP 2: Campaign Restructure (Days 13-14)**

I killed my messy campaigns and started fresh with a proper structure:

**Campaign 1: Auto Campaign (Discovery Mode)**

* Daily budget: $15
* Default bid: $0.75
* Purpose: Let Amazon find new keywords I haven't thought of
* Check this every 3 days to mine for good keywords

**Campaign 2: Manual Exact Match (Money Keywords)**

* Daily budget: $20
* Only keywords I KNOW convert
* Higher bids ($1.20-1.80) because these make money
* My winners: ""resistance bands set"", ""workout bands with handles"", ""exercise bands""

**Campaign 3: Manual Broad Match (Testing)**

* Daily budget: $10
* Testing related keywords
* Lower bids ($0.60-0.90)
* Purpose: Find hidden gems without overspending

**Campaign 4: Product Targeting**

* Daily budget: $10
* Targeting my competitor's ASINs directly
* Super specific, lower volume, but converts well

Total daily budget dropped from $50 to $45, but way more strategic.



**STEP 3: Negative Keywords (The Game Changer)**

This single step saved me probably $400/month.

I went through my search term report and added NEGATIVE keywords for anything that:

* Got clicks but no sales after 20+ clicks
* Was completely irrelevant to my product
* Had the word ""free,"" ""cheap,"" ""wholesale,"" ""bulk"" (bargain hunters, not my customer)

**My negative keyword list (examples):**

* ""door anchor only""
* ""replacement""
* ""repair""
* ""wholesale""
* ""physical therapy""
* ""heavy duty"" (my bands aren't heavy duty, wrong customer)
* Brand names of competitors (if people search ""Brand X bands,"" they want that brand, not mine)

Added about 35 negative keywords in total. My wasted spend dropped IMMEDIATELY.



**STEP 4: Bid Optimization (Weekly Ritual)**

Every Sunday morning (coffee + spreadsheet time), I do this:

**For each keyword, I ask:**

1. **Clicks but no sales after 30 clicks?** ‚Üí Lower bid by 20% or pause
2. **Sales with ACOS under 30%?** ‚Üí Increase bid by 15% (get more of this!)
3. **Sales with ACOS 30-50%?** ‚Üí Keep bid the same, monitor
4. **Sales with ACOS over 60%?** ‚Üí Lower bid by 25%
5. **No clicks at all?** ‚Üí Increase bid by 20% or check if keyword is relevant

I keep a simple spreadsheet:

* Keyword | Clicks | Sales | ACOS | Action Taken | Date

Sounds nerdy, but this 30-minute ritual saves me hundreds.



**STEP 5: Time-of-Day Analysis (Advanced, But Worth It)**

Week 6, I noticed something weird: My ACOS was way higher on weekday mornings (8am-12pm).

Checked the data ‚Äì lots of clicks, fewer conversions during that window. People browsing at work but not buying.

**What I did:**

* Used Amazon's dayparting (time-of-day bidding adjustments)
* Reduced bids by 30% for weekday mornings
* Increased bids by 20% for evenings (7pm-11pm) and weekends

This alone dropped my ACOS by another 8%.



**STEP 6: Match Type Strategy**

Here's what actually worked for me:

**Broad Match:**

* Start here for research
* Low bids ($0.60-0.80)
* Harvest good search terms, then move them to Exact

**Phrase Match:**

* Honestly? I don't use this much anymore
* The middleground between broad and exact isn't worth the complexity for me

**Exact Match:**

* Where I spend 60% of my budget
* Only proven winners
* Higher bids because I KNOW these convert



**THE RESULTS:**

**Week 1-2 (Before changes):**

* ACOS: 140%
* Daily ad spend: $50
* Sales from ads: $35/day
* Burning $15/day

**Week 6-8 (After changes):**

* ACOS: 35%
* Daily ad spend: $38
* Sales from ads: $108/day
* Actually making money!

**Month 2 totals:**

* Ad spend: $1,140
* Sales from ads: $3,257
* ACOS: 35%
* Profit after all fees: $680 (FINALLY IN THE GREEN!)



**MISTAKES I MADE (So You Don't Have To):**

‚ùå **Waiting too long to optimize** ‚Äì Should've audited after 3 days, not 12 ‚ùå **Being afraid to pause low performers** ‚Äì Sunk cost fallacy is real ‚ùå **Not using negative keywords from day 1** ‚Äì Cost me $400+ easily ‚ùå **Setting budgets too high initially** ‚Äì Start conservative, scale up winners ‚ùå **Ignoring placement adjustments** ‚Äì Top of search converts way better for me, so I bid 40% higher there



**MY CURRENT PPC ROUTINE:**

**Daily (5 minutes):**

* Check total spend vs. budget
* Pause anything obviously broken (ACOS over 100%)

**Every 3 days (15 minutes):**

* Review search terms report
* Add new negative keywords
* Harvest good keywords from auto campaign

**Weekly (30 minutes):**

* Full bid optimization review
* Adjust budgets based on performance
* Check competitor pricing (if they dropped price, I might need to adjust bids)

**Monthly (1 hour):**

* Deep dive on overall strategy
* Kill campaigns that aren't working
* Test new keyword opportunities



**TOOLS I USE:**

* **Amazon's native dashboard** (free, obviously)
* **Helium 10 Adtomic** ($99/month, worth it if you're spending $1K+/month on ads)
* **Google Sheets** (for tracking, because I'm old school)
* **SellerBoard** (profit tracking, shows me real ACOS including ALL costs)



**THE HONEST TRUTH:**

PPC is not ""set and forget."" Anyone who tells you that is lying or selling you something.

The first month WILL be expensive. You're paying for data. You're learning what works. That's normal.

But if you're disciplined about optimization, you can get to profitability by month 2-3.

**My current goal:** Get ACOS down to 25% by month 4. I think it's doable if I keep optimizing.



**QUICK-START CHECKLIST FOR NEW SELLERS:**

‚úÖ Start with auto campaign only for first 3-5 days (learn what works) ‚úÖ Set conservative daily budgets ($15-25 to start) ‚úÖ Check search terms report every 2-3 days ‚úÖ Add negative keywords aggressively ‚úÖ Don't panic if ACOS is high in week 1-2 (it's supposed to be) ‚úÖ Move winning keywords to exact match campaigns ‚úÖ Optimize bids weekly, not daily (give data time to accumulate) ‚úÖ Track everything in a spreadsheet ‚úÖ Remember: You're buying data first, profits come later



**Questions I know you'll ask:**

**""What's a good target ACOS?""** Depends on your profit margin. If you make 40% profit, anything under 30% ACOS is great. Under 20% is excellent. I aim for 25-30%.

**""How long until I'm profitable on ads?""** For me, 6 weeks. For most people, 4-8 weeks if you optimize actively.

**""Should I run ads 24/7?""** Yes, at first. Once you have data (week 3-4), you can get smart with dayparting.

**""What if I can't afford to lose money on ads for a month?""** Then you're not ready for Amazon FBA yet. Save up more. I know that sucks to hear, but it's the truth.

1o5gb0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1o5gb0k/for_those_on_a_stall/,For those on a stall........,"This may be a no-brainer for most of you, but if you are on keto and run into a stall (4 weeks+) I highly suggest going carnivore.

Background:

I was 420lbs (6'1"") in March 2024. I went ""dirty keto"" eating everything that was keto but staying under 20 NET carbs a day. I got down to 377 lbs in December, right after Christmas. 

I decided to switch it up and go ""clean keto"", basically eating only whole foods, no bad seed oils, no ""keto"" snacks, etc. Occasionally eating Hero Bread and ZERO carb coffee creamer. I fasted usually 12-16 hours a day.

It worked even better than dirty keto as I dropped down to 310 lbs in just 8 months (August 2025). 

Then the stall happened from August to October 1  and I couldnt lose anything-4 total lbs. My 2 tablespoons of ZERO sugar creamer, heavy creamer, diet sodas, and all the cheeses, etc....caught up to me.

Again, decided to even go even more drastic and start a carnivore diet just 1 week ago. No dairy, no diet sodas, etc....

Black coffee, hamburger, steak, butter, bacon, sugar free sausage, etc....

From October 6 to today, October 13, I am now down to 287 lbs. I have lost 12 lbs in just 1 week on carnivore.

The best part about it?

It curbed my appetite from wanting to eat all day long to eating 2 meals a day (Noon and 4-5pm). I can fast so much easier without the ""fake sugars"" from diet soda, zero sugar coffee creamer, etc.

I highly suggest this for anyone that has run into any stalls!

Good luck!

It was really nice, but I learnt stuff about him that was somewhat offputting from mutual friends and idk what to do. 

Basically, I met this guy at my friend's birthday party. We both go to the same uni. He was really nice and we chatted the whole night, before going on to chat over Instagram for the following few weeks. Eventually he asked me out for coffee and we went to this lovely place where he paid for my drink and we sat and chatted for hours. 

He's really attractive, kind, clever and a pleasant person to be around and talk to. But, I learnt some red flags from my friend who lived with him last year:

He is known for picking his nose and eating it or flicking it in public (she described it as digging for gold), he can be quite an inconsiderately loud person to live with and then perhaps the cherry on top: while making out with guy X a few days before I met him, he wet the bed. Guy X was super sweet to him and washed all his clothes etc and didnt hold anything against him, but the guy I went on a date with just ghosts guy X leaving him heartbroken. 

Idk, part of me is deeply put off by this collection of red flags, but I also really like him. The bed wetting could just be a one off that doesn't happen again, and I'd feel bad dropping him ovef that. But I also cant decide if maybe my desperation is coming out and maybe im only torn because I have finally found a guy who likes me back. 

Any advice on this situation would be much appreciated because everytime I see a picture of him I get mad butterflies in my stomach and I need to decide which way I want to go with it. 

Have an amazing day!",1,1760352211.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

She gets incredibly anxious and jumpy when at the grandparents and is all over the place with jumping from excitement and not being able to do much else so we have to leave after 1 hour . She plays really well with her peers , always waits her turn and shares nicely . No hitting , pushing etc ever . She is sensitive about food but as a few staples like home made bolognese pasta , egg muffins with courgettes and cheese . Lasagna with spinach , carrots , apples . Yogurt , fish cakes , curry with rice , noodles with broccoli She is  calm at home and plays on her own a lot , sleeps 15 hours a day , eats well etc. I know she might have sensory processing disorder but not a lot can be done at this stage . She struggles in a lot of places and we can‚Äôt go to restaurants or coffee shops . We can only manage food shopping . She has been having more tantrums lately . I know she might need an evaluation along the way but the fact that she scored really well on the five areas of development they can‚Äôt do anything about it . No OT unless private.  Her paediatrician said she has a sensory profile that leans toward cautious and active because she can focus really well on different things and self regulate but she is more sensitive than the average kid . What it actually means for her future I don‚Äôt know . I did mention SPD but she is not sensitive to light , touch , texture , noise to the extent of impacting her functioning  ( for now ) .

BOOK TWO OF THE LUNAS OF EMERALD CITY

DUAL POV

Starring Val & Antoine

What would you do if you happened to have a drunken one night with someone you shouldn‚Äôt? Well, Valerie would very much love to turn back the clock and not sleep with her boss, the feared, cursed Alpha, Antoine Pierre. But when he proposes a situationship, Valerie hops on it and stupidly so.

Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?

PROLOGUE

VAL‚ÄôS POV

In the past couple of minutes or so, I‚Äôve pictured killing my best friend Maeve. She looks at me, guilt written all over the hazel in her eyes. Usually, I‚Äôm the one bound to make reckless decisions. But not her. She is the epitome of perfection. Afterall, she is the Grand Luna of the country. She is the kind of person I expect would think things through before dropping a fucking bomb on me.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶you are overreacting,‚Äù she nervously chuckles, cradling her warm cup of coffee.

‚ÄúOverreacting?‚Äù I blew out breath, ‚Äú I get that it‚Äôs a given I‚Äôm your maid of honor but putting my boss as the best man?‚Äù

‚ÄúBelieve me, if I could, I would change it. But its Vik‚Äôs choice,‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about Andrei? I‚Äôm certain he‚Äôd be glad to be his brother‚Äôs best man,‚Äù I throw out the suggestion.

‚ÄúHe already asked him and it turns out, its not his kind of thing,‚Äù she places her coffee down, releasing an exasperated sigh, before reaching for my hands and pressing them, ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm sorry. I know how much you hate Antoine and I don‚Äôt blame you. The guy is a fucking jerk. But just this once, let it slide please,‚Äù

I close my eyes briefly before opening them. Maeve knows how to tag my heart strings. She knows I would absolutely anything for her.

‚ÄúFine. But if I kill him, you are serving my prison sentence,‚Äù

Smile breaks on her face, ‚ÄúOh, goddess, I love you,‚Äù

Yeah, I‚Äôm definitely going to regret this.

# 1. What the absolute-

CHAPTER ONE

WHAT THE ABSOLUTE-

Antoine Pierre. Thirty years old. CEO of Pierre business conglomerate with branches all over the world. Alpha of the second fiercest pack in Emerald city; the Silverclaw pack. He has a reputation and not a good one I fear. I mean, sure women are driven hungry by the power he exudes and for some reason I do not understand, they find him absolutely breathtaking. The men? Well, they would rather be not on his bad side. He might just wake up in a mood to have your balls stuffed in your mouth.

And yet, none of them know him like I do. They have no idea how many times he has driven me insane. Or the number of potential relationships I‚Äôve lost. Or the number of times I‚Äôve thought of killing him. Okay, maybe the latter is an exaggeration. My entire world revolves around me being his personal assistant. I could be asleep in the middle of the night and if he calls, I‚Äôd have to do whatever he wants. The pay is absolutely terrific. I‚Äôm talking two-hundred grand a year. Perhaps that, and the fact that I definitely need the money. In this city, its hard to find a job that pays this much.

‚ÄúMiss. Washington,‚Äù His deep voice cuts through the stillness of the air surrounding my desk.

I stand up quickly, ‚ÄúYes, Sir,‚Äù

He is standing at the entrance of his office, his tie loosened just a bit, the sleeves of his shirt pulled up to reveal veined hands. He has his glasses on, his hair tangled just a bit. Fine. Maybe I understand why some woman go feral when they see him. Still doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that I hate him and rightfully so.

‚ÄúYou know when I call you, I expect you to come over,‚Äù Of, course how could I forget he is a jerk on most days?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry sir,‚Äù I rush over, trying not to trip on my stilettos. I make sure to grab my planner and a pen, just incase he needs something to be put down. Its clear enough he is in a terrible mood. The last thing I need is for him to be more pissed than he already is. Wait, what if he is pissed off about the wedding?

‚ÄúMy parents would be in town next week. Make a dinner reservation for four next Wednesday at that new French hotel,‚Äù he frowns, ‚ÄúWhat was the name again?‚Äù",1,1760351863.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1o5g0qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1o5g0qk/is_it_safe_to_top_off_sleeping_hours_with_naps_as/,Is it safe to top off sleeping hours with naps as NSS?,"So, I am pretty much considered a short sleeper, my average sleep time sits around 5h 20m, which is perfectly comfortable for me. I would say, reading this sub, its much easier for me to maintain sleeping schedule and consistent sleep quality, than for fellow redditors, it doesnt seem like coffee, blue light or time when I go off to a bed affect my sleep in any way.

However, I still do have some concerns regarding naps. I do sometimes find myself sleeping for 3-4 hours, for example, when I am woken by light, noise or movement, which doesnt feel in any way devastating, probably because happens relatively rarely, but still feels insufficient, dangerous. 

I'm perfectly capable of napping on such occasions for an hour or so, right away or later, during the day, but I wonder, whether this would leave negative impact, compared to normal sleep. I've seen there're some people with similar sleep patterns, so it'd be great to hear from them, since neither doctors nor chatgpt can provide cohesive answers. Does it matter how long you nap? Or during which time of the day? Do you feel effects of lack of sleep if woken up mid-night?",2,1760351211.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
