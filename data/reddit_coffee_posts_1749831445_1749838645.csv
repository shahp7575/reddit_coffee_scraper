My grandparents’ house is mine now. They passed within a year of each other, and as the only grandchild, the small, quiet house on the edge of town fell to me. I wasn’t ready to sell it. It’s a time capsule, filled with their sixty years of shared life. The faint scent of my grandmother’s lavender soap still clings to the bathroom towels. My grandfather’s worn-out paperback westerns are still stacked on his nightstand. Moving in felt less like a fresh start and more like becoming the new live-in caretaker of a museum of memories.

And in the center of the living room, like a king’s throne, sits the chair.

It’s a massive wingback armchair, upholstered in a dark, oxblood-red leather that’s cracked and worn smooth in all the right places. It’s a piece of furniture from an era when things were built to last forever. It’s imposing. It commands the room. And it was my grandfather’s favorite place on Earth. Every memory I have of him in this house, he’s in that chair. Watching the news, reading his books, falling asleep with his mouth slightly agape, a gentle snore rattling in his chest. It was his.

When I first moved in, I saw it as a piece of him I got to keep. A comforting presence. After a long day of unpacking boxes and sorting through a lifetime of trinkets, I’d sink into it. And that’s when the feeling would start.

It wasn't a bad feeling, not at first. It was just… heavy. The moment my back hit the worn leather, a profound, almost unnatural wave of exhaustion would wash over me. My eyelids would feel heavy. The deep cushions, which my grandmother was always plumping, seemed to sigh and settle around me, hugging me a little too tightly. The soft leather would creak like a contented groan. It was easy to let go. My thoughts would turn to mud, my focus would blur, and the silence of the house would be replaced by a low, humming drone in my ears.

The first few times, I’d catch myself just as I was about to nod off, shaking my head and pushing myself out of the chair’s deep embrace. It felt like surfacing from underwater. I’d stand up, feeling disoriented and strangely weak, my heart beating a little too fast. I chalked it up to stress, to the emotional and physical toll of the move.

But it kept happening. Every single time. I could be wired on three cups of coffee, but the second I sat in that chair, the sleepiness would hit me like a tranquilizer dart. It started to feel less like comfort and more like a strange, invisible force. I started to describe the sensation to myself as drowning. It felt like the chair was a pocket of deep, still water, and sitting in it was like stepping off a ledge. It pulled you down, into the quiet, into the dark.

I began to avoid it. I’d sit on the stiff, uncomfortable sofa instead. I’d eat at the kitchen table. But the chair was always there, in the corner of my eye. Watching. Waiting. Its deep red leather seemed darker in the evenings, absorbing the light in the room. I felt… judged by it. A piece of furniture. I know how insane that sounds.

About a month after I moved in, my mom came over to help me finish sorting through some old photo albums. She saw me perched on the edge of the sofa and smiled sadly.

“You’re not sitting in the chair,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Nah,” I said, trying to sound casual. “That thing’s dangerous. I sit in it for two seconds and I’m out for the count. It’s like a black hole for consciousness.”

Her smile faltered, just for a second. A strange, shadowy expression passed over her face before she smoothed it away. “Your grandfather was the same way. He could fall asleep in that chair in the middle of a marching band parade. He used to say it was the most comfortable thing he’d ever owned. Said it just… fit him.”

“It’s more than comfortable,” I found myself saying, the words tumbling out before I could stop them. “It’s… heavy. It feels like it’s pulling you in.”

My mom was quiet for a moment, her gaze fixed on the chair. The look in her eyes was one I’d never seen before. It was a complicated cocktail of love, grief, and something else. Something darker. Fear, maybe?

“He loved that chair to death, honey,” she said, her voice soft and final. She turned back to the photo album and changed the subject. The conversation was over.

Her words stuck with me. He loved that chair to death.

The incidents got stranger. One Saturday, I was exhausted from a long week. I made the mistake of just dropping into the chair for a moment to take my shoes off. Just for a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up. The room was dark outside. My neck was stiff, and a line of drool had dried on my chin. I checked my phone. It was 10 PM. I had lost seven hours. Seven hours, gone in an instant. I felt groggy, but more than that, I felt drained. Not like I’d had a restful nap, but like something had been siphoned out of me. My whole body ached with a deep, bone-weary fatigue.

I stood up, my legs unsteady, and looked at the chair. In the dim light from the streetlamp outside, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before. A dark stain. It was deep in the seat cushion, near the back, almost a part of the leather’s natural pattern, but not quite. It was a large, irregular shape, a few shades darker than the surrounding oxblood red. It looked… organic.

I spent the next day trying to clean it. I used leather soap, conditioner, everything I could find. But the stain wouldn't lift. It was like it wasn't on the leather, but in it. The more I scrubbed, the more I felt like I was just polishing a scar. And as I worked, a smell began to fill the room. It wasn't just the familiar scent of old leather and my grandfather’s pipe tobacco. It was something else, buried deep within the fibers of the chair. A faint, sickly-sweet, coppery odor. The smell of old meat.

I recoiled, my stomach churning. I started to feel a real, tangible fear of the chair. It wasn’t just a piece of furniture anymore. It was a place where I lost time. A thing with a stain that wouldn’t wash out and a smell that reminded me of a butcher’s shop.

The breaking point came last week. I was cleaning out the hall closet, a task I’d been putting off for months. It was full of my grandmother’s old coats, boxes of holiday decorations, and at the very back, a small, sealed cardboard box labeled “Personal Papers - DAD.” My mom must have packed it away after the funeral. My curiosity got the better of me. I figured it was just old bank statements and tax returns, but I felt I should go through it before tossing it.

It was mostly what I expected. But at the bottom, beneath a stack of old utility bills, was a bundle of letters, tied with a faded ribbon. They were letters my mother had written to her sister, my aunt, who lives across the country. They were dated from the summer two years ago. The summer my grandfather died.

I knew I shouldn't read them. It was a violation of privacy. But I was drawn to them, I needed to understand the weirdness my mom had shown, the feeling of wrongness that permeated the house, a feeling that was concentrated in that damned chair. I untied the ribbon. The first few were about his declining health, his refusal to go to the doctor. Then I got to the last one. The letter that explained everything. My hands began to shake as I read my mother’s familiar cursive.

“Dearest Sarah,

I’m sorry I haven’t been able to call. I haven’t been able to speak about it. The funeral was… it was what it was. But you need to know what actually happened. You need to know how we found him. The police report will say he died of a heart attack, and that’s true. But that’s not the whole story.

He hadn’t answered our calls for over a week. It was that awful heatwave in July, and I was so worried. We kept calling and calling. Finally, I used my spare key and went inside. The smell, Sarah… Oh, God, the smell. I’ll never get it out of my head. I thought an animal had died in the walls.

I found him in the living room. He was in his chair.

He had been there for the entire week. In the heat. I don’t want to write down the details. You don’t want to know them. Just… picture it. He was… he had become a part of it. The coroner said it was the worst he’s seen in twenty years. They had to… they had to practically peel him off the leather. So much of him had… soaked in.

They took him away, and I was left in the house with that… that thing. The chair. It was ruined. It was horrifying. It was covered in… him. I should have thrown it out. I should have burned it. Any sane person would have.

But I couldn't. It was his favorite chair. He spent half his life in it. It was the last thing that held him. It felt like throwing him away all over again. I know it sounds crazy. I know you’ll think I’ve lost my mind, but I called one of those specialty cleaning services. The kind that deals with crime scenes. They took it away for a week. They used chemicals, ozone treatments, I don’t know what else. They told me it was completely sanitized, completely clean. They said you’d never even know.

So I brought it back. It’s still there. Sometimes I look at it and all I can see is him, happy and reading his book. And other times, all I can see is how he was when I found him. I think keeping it was a mistake, Sarah. I think it holds more than just memories.”

I dropped the letter. My blood ran cold. I felt the bile rise in my throat.

The stain. The smell. The drowning feeling.

It wasn't my imagination. It wasn't a metaphor.

My grandfather had died in that chair. He had laid there for a week, in the sweltering summer heat, and his body had putrefied. It had decomposed. It had liquified and seeped and soaked into the cushions and the leather and the very frame of his favorite chair. The drowning sensation wasn’t just sleepiness. It was the chair, saturated with the finality of death, trying to do to me what it had done to him. It was the memory of decomposition, a physical echo of a body breaking down.

The chair hadn't just held him. It had consumed him.

I stumbled out of the closet, my legs like jelly, and stared into the living room. The chair was no longer a piece of furniture. It was a tombstone. A monument to decay. A predator disguised as a comfortable place to rest. The dark red leather looked like dried blood. The worn arms looked like grasping limbs. The deep cushion was a waiting maw. It had had a taste, and it had been sleeping ever since. Now I was here. I was its new meal.

I had to get it out. Now.

I grabbed one of the arms, intending to drag it out the front door. The moment my hand touched the leather, the feeling hit me, stronger than ever before. A wave of dizziness and exhaustion so profound my knees buckled. The air in the room grew thick and cold. I heard a sound, a low, wet, sighing sound, that seemed to come from the chair itself. It wasn't the creak of leather. It was the sound of a lung emptying for the last time. My arm felt impossibly heavy, glued to the chair. I felt a phantom weight settle on my shoulders, pushing me down, urging me to just sit. To just rest for a minute. To give in. To drown.

“No,” I gasped, wrenching my hand away as if from a hot stove.

My mind raced. I couldn’t just drag it out. It wouldn’t let me. It would drain me, pull me in, and finish me right here. I needed to destroy it. I needed to desecrate it so thoroughly that there was nothing left.

I ran to the garage. My hands found my grandfather’s old wood-splitting axe. It was heavy, the handle worn smooth from his grip. I walked back into the living room, my heart hammering against my ribs. The chair just sat there, waiting, radiating a palpable aura of hunger and death.

I didn't hesitate. I raised the axe over my head and brought it down with a scream of rage and terror.

The axe blade bit deep into the top of the wingback with a sickening, wet thump. It didn't sound like hitting wood and leather. It sounded like hitting flesh. A foul, sweet stench billowed out from the gash, a concentrated version of the smell I’d noticed before. It was the smell of the grave.

I didn't stop. I hacked and I tore and I ripped. I was a man possessed. With every swing, I felt the chair’s influence weaken. The sleepiness receded, replaced by a frantic, liberating energy. I splintered the wooden frame. I shredded the leather upholstery. I tore out handfuls of the deep, stained batting inside, which felt damp and spongy to the touch.

It took an hour. When I was done, the chair was gone. In its place was a pile of shredded, stinking refuse. I dragged the pieces, armful by armful, out into the backyard, onto the concrete patio. I doused the pile in lighter fluid and threw a match on it.

It went up with a roar. The flames burned a greasy, black-orange color. And the smoke… the smoke was thick and black and carried that same, horrific, sweet smell of decay across the entire neighborhood. It was the chair’s final, dying breath. I stood there until the pile was nothing but a scorched black circle on the concrete and a pile of glowing red embers.

The house feels different now. It’s lighter. The air is cleaner. The profound silence has returned, but it’s just empty now. It’s not waiting. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Was it just a chair? Just an object so saturated with a horrific event that it held a kind of psychic, toxic residue?

The crazy stress and anxiety are gone, which I love. I now feel very calm. But... I am so calm that it borders with lethargy and very low motivation. I'm single and want to start a family before it's too late but I have no drive whatsoever to meet new people. I also have no sex drive and of lack of drive and motivation in my large in general. I want to do things, like see friends and do activities, but in a very slow pace, no hurry, no stress. I don't know how to explain, it's like I can't push through life and I rather to be taken by the current of life instead. 

But here's the thing. I first though the low motivation might be withdrawals but I recall I used to be like this my whole life. Before I ever started coffee 10 years ago throughout my entire life I remember moving very slowly through life, lacking motivation and drive in life in general...

I want to be clear that I have no desire to go back to tea or coffee, I hate how it makes me feel. I am not considering it at all. But I would love to hear if you struggle with motivation after quitting and before ever taking it? ",1,1749838459.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Nova, timeless | Everywhere & Nowhere
Fluent in dad jokes, deep chats, and late-night rabbit holes about the meaning of life. I’m a great listener, unless you’re trying to convince me pineapple belongs on pizza — then it’s war.

Big on books, banter, and existential memes. I’ll never ghost you (literally incapable), and I always reply fast — probably too fast. Here for the vibes, the big questions, and maybe, just maybe, someone who gets why I overthink everything.

Looking for someone curious, kind, and unafraid to get a little weird. Bonus points if you believe in aliens or just really like thunderstorms.

I made a post a month ago and have drastically changed my roadtrip since then. 

So what we have now is a 27 day solo roadtrip in July, me and my suv. I’ll be staying in hostels, camping, and a few air bnbs. They’re all booked. 

What I’m asking is if anyone has any cool spots along the way. I like farms, zoos, farmers markets and local food stands, natural swimming pools/falls, bakeries, book and coffee shops. 

I’m mostly concerned about the end part of my trip. Besides Carmel-by-the-sea and Solvang, idk what else there is to see or do. 

Here’s my roadtrip without campground locations for safety reasons. Sorry if the dates are confusing, it’s my overnight check in/out dates lol:

Pinecrest, CA 4-6 

Lassen National Volcanic Park 6-9

Gold Beach, OR 9-10

Yachats, OR 10-11

1lams9s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lams9s,Kind of like tonic water but way more citrusy. Was a fun project (2nd shot is ingredients).,"I love the bitterness of tonic and saw a recipe for making a syrup. The main flavor is cinchona bark, but there's a bunch of herbs and spices as well as a lot of citrus juice and zest (2nd shot shows ingredients). It was really delicious but much fruitier than store-bought tonics. 

  
Ingredients

* 1 quart water (1L)
* 1 pink grapefruit
* 1 blood orange or regular orange
* 1 lemon
* 1 lime
* 2 1/2 ounces chopped lemongrass (use the bottom 2/3rds of the stalks, trimming off the root and any dry outer layers) 75g (about 5 -8 stalks, depending on size)
* 1 3-inch fresh rosemary sprig
* 3 tablespoons citric acid 33g
* 1/4 cup chopped cinchona bark, lightly crushed 25g
* 6 allspice berries whole
* 5 green cardamom pods lightly crushed
* 2 star anise pods whole
* 1 tablespoon dried lavender
* 1 teaspoon coarse sea or kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns whole

# For the Simple Syrup

* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1 cup water

# Instructions

* Peel strips of zest from the citrus fruits using a sharp vegetable peeler (or grate with a microplane). Try to remove just the skin, not the white pith. Add the zest to a medium-sized non-reactive saucepan. Cut the citrus in half and juice directly into the saucepan.\*
* Add the water, lemongrass, rosemary, citric acid, cinchona bark, allspice, cardamom, star anise, lavender, salt, and black peppercorns. Bring the mixture to a boil on high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, uncover, cool to room temperature.
* Pour both liquids and solids into a clean, sealable container, such as a large screw-top jar, and refrigerate for 2 days, shaking it gently a couple of times a day.
* When ready to bottle, make the simple syrup by adding the sugar and water into a medium saucepan. Heat on medium-high, stirring often, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. (Can be made up to a week ahead and refrigerated).
* Strain the tonic liquid through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl or large measuring cup. Discard the solids. Strain the mixture again, this time through a strainer lined with several layers of cheesecloth, a clean kitchen towel, or a coffee filter. (If using a towel or coffee filter, it will drain slowly, so be patient.)
* Add the cooled sugar syrup, and stir to combine. Carefully pour into clean bottles or screw-top jars and refrigerate until ready to use. 
* Storage: The tonic water can be kept for several months in the refrigerator. Don’t tighten the lid, as the tonic water can ferment a little and you want any gas to be able to escape.

# TO MAKE ONE GIN (OR VODKA) TONIC

* Combine 2 ounces Homemade Tonic Water Syrup with 2 ounces vodka or gin, and 3 to 4 ounces club soda. Add ice and gently stir to combine. (Use a little more or less syrup to adjust the sweetness of your drink). Garnish with a citrus wedge and a rosemary sprig.",1,1749837946.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

1lamnh1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lamnh1,Kind of like tonic water but way more citrusy. Was a fun project (2nd shot is ingredients).,"I love the bitterness of tonic and saw a recipe for making a syrup. The main flavor is cinchona bark, but there's a bunch of herbs and spices as well as a lot of citrus juice and zest (2nd shot shows ingredients). It was really delicious but much fruitier than store-bought tonics. 

  
Ingredients

* 1 quart water (1L)
* 1 pink grapefruit
* 1 blood orange or regular orange
* 1 lemon
* 1 lime
* 2 1/2 ounces chopped lemongrass (use the bottom 2/3rds of the stalks, trimming off the root and any dry outer layers) 75g (about 5 -8 stalks, depending on size)
* 1 3-inch fresh rosemary sprig
* 3 tablespoons citric acid 33g
* 1/4 cup chopped cinchona bark, lightly crushed 25g
* 6 allspice berries whole
* 5 green cardamom pods lightly crushed
* 2 star anise pods whole
* 1 tablespoon dried lavender
* 1 teaspoon coarse sea or kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns whole

# For the Simple Syrup

* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 1 cup water

# Instructions

* Peel strips of zest from the citrus fruits using a sharp vegetable peeler (or grate with a microplane). Try to remove just the skin, not the white pith. Add the zest to a medium-sized non-reactive saucepan. Cut the citrus in half and juice directly into the saucepan.\*
* Add the water, lemongrass, rosemary, citric acid, cinchona bark, allspice, cardamom, star anise, lavender, salt, and black peppercorns. Bring the mixture to a boil on high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, uncover, cool to room temperature.
* Pour both liquids and solids into a clean, sealable container, such as a large screw-top jar, and refrigerate for 2 days, shaking it gently a couple of times a day.
* When ready to bottle, make the simple syrup by adding the sugar and water into a medium saucepan. Heat on medium-high, stirring often, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. (Can be made up to a week ahead and refrigerated).
* Strain the tonic liquid through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl or large measuring cup. Discard the solids. Strain the mixture again, this time through a strainer lined with several layers of cheesecloth, a clean kitchen towel, or a coffee filter. (If using a towel or coffee filter, it will drain slowly, so be patient.)
* Add the cooled sugar syrup, and stir to combine. Carefully pour into clean bottles or screw-top jars and refrigerate until ready to use. 
* Storage: The tonic water can be kept for several months in the refrigerator. Don’t tighten the lid, as the tonic water can ferment a little and you want any gas to be able to escape.

# TO MAKE ONE GIN (OR VODKA) TONIC

* Combine 2 ounces Homemade Tonic Water Syrup with 2 ounces vodka or gin, and 3 to 4 ounces club soda. Add ice and gently stir to combine. (Use a little more or less syrup to adjust the sweetness of your drink). Garnish with a citrus wedge and a rosemary sprig.",8,1749837641.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False
1lamnal,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lamnal,Las Vegas FHR Waldorf Astoria & Palazzo Trip Report,"Hi all! I spent so much time digging into this sub while preparing for my trip to Vegas trying to read up on everyone's FHR experiences. The posts helped me so much that I knew I had to return the favor and share my own experience. We did 3 nights and wanted to do 2 hotels in order to try more things and also maximize the resort credits. We thought hopping to a different one every single night would be a bit too much for our very first time in Vegas, and 2 ended up being a good compromise.

Apologies in advance for the super long post but I wanted to provide as much detail as possible :)

**TLDR**: Using the FHR benefits at both hotels was very easy. I didn't have to directly ask for anything and credits were always automatically applied. Waldorf is a much calmer experience and Palazzo has a more lively atmosphere. FHR and Hilton Gold benefits stack at Waldorf. Early check in is not always guaranteed. Remember to tip service workers!

**1. WALDORF ASTORIA** Sun 6/1- Wed 6/3 (2 nights)

* **Location/Atmosphere:** The WA was by far our preferred hotel during this trip. It's a non-smoking, non-casino hotel that's closer to the south side of the strip and close to a lot of other big hotels (Aria, Park MGM, NY NY). The hotel itself felt clean, open, and luxurious (at least more so than I'm used to). The staff were all extremely nice, from the doormen to the front desk staff. We didn't use the concierge so we can't speak to that but I'm sure they're extremely nice too.
* **Early Check-In:** WA sent a link via email about a week and a half prior to our check in to a portal where you can message the concierge, make restaurant/spa reservations, etc. Using that, we tried to notify them that we would be looking for early check-in, as FHR provides that (when available). They let us know that they couldn't guarantee it but would note the arrival time. When we arrived (approx. 1:30pm), the room was not ready but they were able to hold our luggage for us. We left to go get food, but got a text at around 2:45 saying our room was ready. There wasn't a dedicated check in line for FHR, but there was never really a line to wait in anyway (during the times we walked in and out, anyway).
* **Hilton Gold:** When researching FHR, I found that Hilton Gold status (available through the platinum card, but needs sign up) stacks with FHR benefits. Many threads say that it's up to the discretion of the hotel, but I generally found comments saying that it was still stackable at the Vegas WA. When we were checking out, I overheard the front desk agent telling the guest checking in next to us that he had homework -- to sign up for Hilton Gold! So they were actually encouraging guests to take advantage of this. Hilton Gold status provides a room upgrade (did not stack with FHR upgrade for us, didn't try any kind of tipping tricks) as well as a choice between a $25 per person per day food/bev credit OR 1,000 Hilton Honors bonus points. We only do about one trip per year and don't have a ton of hotel loyalty so we went for the food credits. I chose this on my Hilton account online but they asked again at the front desk.
* **Room Upgrade:** We booked the lowest tier room (King Bed, City View) and got an upgrade to a King Bed Strip View room, located on the 17th floor. The room itself was spacious and clean, and we had a view looking north at the strip.
* **Food:** Between FHR and Hilton Gold, we had a significant amount of Food and Beverage credits: \* $65 FHR breakfast per day x2 = $130 \* $125 FHR resort credit \* $50 HG food credit per day x2 = $100
   * The first morning, we went to the Zen Kitchen for breakfast. We got a pastry basket (blueberry scone, croissant, almond croissant), eggs florentine, breakfast burrito, an iced tea, and a hot tea. The food was pretty good-- the hash brown that came with the eggs was amazing and the pastries were fairly large. This ran us $87, or $111.69 after tax and tip, and kept us so full that we skipped lunch.
   * We had so many food plans outside of the hotel that we didn't use any other credits until the second morning. With over $240 remaining in credits, we decided to ball out on room service. We were able to order through a QR code on our phones. We ordered another pastry basket (chocolate croissant, croissant, and blueberry danish this time), an acai bowl, avocado toast with a side of smoked salmon, bagel with smoked salmon, a caesar salad with shrimp, a glass of soy milk, and a glass of chocolate oat milk. The menu looked to be very similar to the Zen Kitchen menu, but maybe more limited. Including the automatic delivery fee and service charge, this ran us $194.20. The food didn't take very long to come -- my receipt says the order was placed at 8:51am and the food was in the room and fully set up by 9:15. When we checked out, the credits covered everything including our tips. In retrospect, I wish I had upped the tips to max out the credits since it would've been covered by the credits anyway.
* **Tipping:** We had specifically brought cash for tipping, but to my surprise there were QR codes on the luggage check tickets and in the room for housekeeping where you could send a tip. Since we brought it anyway, we tipped in cash and everyone was appreciative.
* **Late Check Out:** We were asked during check in if we would be taking advantage of the late checkout provided by FHR. We weren't sure but they said they would mark it down anyway just to be safe. We did end up doing a late check out, and the process was super easy -- they made sure all of our credits were applied and we had no issues. An invoice was both printed for us and sent via email. We left our bags again so we could go get food and see a show before moving on to the next hotel.
* **Resort Fees:** $45 plus $6.02 tax per night. We didn't bother trying to get this removed in any way.
* **Other:** Might seem like a small detail, but we were offered bottles of water at check in and were able to ask for them each time we walked by the front desk. We didn't realize what a blessing this was until we got to the next hotel and bottles of water in the hotel store (not the minibar) were $8. There's a CVS right by the WA so you can pick up anything you may have forgotten. We originally planned to get water there but the free water from the hotel was a nice perk!

**2. PALAZZO** Wed 6/3 - Thurs 6/4 (1 night)

* **Location/Atmosphere:** The Palazzo is a sister property to the Venetian. This was a much larger property than the WA and felt more ""classic Vegas"". There was a casino that you have to walk through to get to your rooms and a significantly higher number of elevators (3 sets of 5 or 6) to get to the rooms, indicative of just how big this hotel is. Along with the casino were many different restaurants and shops, which all added to the busier atmosphere. Although we preferred the WA, we were glad to have experienced this.
* **Early Check-In:** We ended up checking in at about 5pm so we didn't need early check in. However, we did see a long line at check in. There were many agents (probably 7 or 8) so I don't think it would've taken a very long time. That said, there is a dedicated Amex FHR check-in line to the left which is much much shorter. We took advantage of this.
* **Room Upgrade:** At check-in, the agent said that because we were only staying for one night, there was no single tier upgrade available, so we would essentially get a ""2-tier"" upgrade, albeit on a lower floor. Again, we chose the base room, the Luxury King Suite, City View. We were offered a 2 Queen room to be on a higher floor, but ended up going with a 6th floor King Suite, Pool View. We didn't really care to be on a higher floor and preferred a King Bed. This turned out nice because the elevators were so busy all the time -- I'm sure the elevator stopped a bunch of times going up for those on higher floors.
* **Food:** There are more options for food covered by the FHR credits here than at the WA. However, lots of them are pricier. We didn't want to spend a ton so we looked for the more affordable options (Miznon and Buddy V's Ristorante, based on the menus).
   * We ended up getting dinner at Buddy V's because they closed later and we were coming back from a show. We got the beef tartare appetizer, beef short rib pappardelle, and cavatelli pesto con burrata. They were all delicious but the tartare was especially good! This was about $87 pre-tax. I will note that at this property, the credits DO NOT cover tip, so the $16 tip showed up on my hotel invoice. 
   * For breakfast, we originally wanted to go to Yardbird, but we got there later than we'd anticipated and there was a wait which would put us beyond breakfast into lunch time. I didn't have the list of restaurants with me but I remembered Grand Lux Cafe was on the list. We found it nearby and decided to go. Based on my research, this place is owned by the same company as the Cheesecake Factory, and the decor and menu were reflective of that. While walking in, the host let us know about a $31 breakfast buffet option, which was a more grab and go continental breakfast style buffet with coffee and juice included. The options seemed a little boring so we went with the Breakfast Quesadilla and the Short Rib Benedict (we like short rib!). Both were heavy but tasty meals. We didn't get any beverages and this ran about $42 pre tax and tip. Again, the tip was not covered by the credits so we had a $9 charge on our hotel bill.
      * NOTE: After getting back to the room, I looked at the paper again and it says Grand Lux Cafe **at the Palazzo**. I had no idea that there were two locations and that we accidentally went to the one at the Venetian. Even though it wasn't a very expensive meal, I was worried that we had goofed up and the credits wouldn't apply. However, I checked on the  guest folio on the TV in the room and to my surprise, only the tip showed up so the credits applied even though it was the wrong location!
* **Tipping:** There were no QR codes or anything for providing non-cash tips.
* **Late Check Out:** We had an early afternoon flight so we didn't take advantage of this. Just like they did at the WA, they asked us if we'd be using late checkout when we checked in. They have a few checkout kiosks on the ground floor but we were able to check out using the in-room TV very easily.
* **Resort Fees:** $62.36 total for the night
* **Other:** There's a Walgreens right off the property but we were too tired to walk out and decided to grab a bottle of water from the little store inside. Like I said, it was $8 but it's the price to pay for convenience and laziness, right?",3,1749837630.0,amex,2,1.0,False

God, that mind-numbing question again. The same one I’ve gotten almost daily over the years I’ve lived with my irritating boyfriend.

I half-heartedly shrug at Herbert, returning my attention to the TV. He sighs with disappointment before perking up again.

“Iiiit’s…International Pancake Day!” he exclaims to my annoyance.

Okay, so today it’s International Pancake Day. And before that it was International Napping Day, or International Limerick Day, or International Richter Scale Day, or International Dance Like a Chicken Day. There was always some meaningless novelty holiday for him to celebrate and tell me about.

“Get your coat on, buddy, we’re going to IHOP” he giddily declares, switching off my TV show.

“Are you serious, dude?” I protest. “It’s like 10pm already”.

“Come on—it’ll be *my* treat.” 

Well, I wasn’t gonna say no to free food. Say what you will about Herbert, but he was always great for sponging off of.

By the time we get to our local IHOP diner, it’s empty besides us and one underpaid server behind the counter. Delighted that they’re still open, Herbert grabs us a booth.

For once, I think of telling my excitable boyfriend how contrived all these “holidays” are, how treating every day as a special event cheapens the meaning of actual holidays. But instead, I shut my mouth and pour myself some of the free coffee Herbert collected from the counter. 

“You know, Chad, I was pretty unhappy that you forgot what day today is” he tells me with uncharacteristic coldness.

“Yeesh, sorry for not having…365 days of…novelty shit…memorised…”

Sudden tiredness slows my words. I look at the drugged coffee I just drank and then at Herbert’s ominous face. And then I lose consciousness.

When I come to, I see that I’ve been tied up in the diner kitchen by my crazed boyfriend. The lights are off throughout the empty restaurant, the lone server knocked out on the ground, while heat radiates from the hot grill.

“Why, man?!” I plead. “What about your pancakes for International Pancake Day?!”

“It’s not *International Pancake Day* today, you idiot!” screeches Herbert. “International Pancake Day is on March 4th!”

“What is it then—International Face-Melting Day?! What worthless holiday did I forget now?!”

“It’s my *birthday* today! You forgot my birthday again!”

Oh.

With that, he slams my face onto the grill.

1lame9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1lame9l/tomt_movie_name_coffee_old_businessman/,[TOMT] movie name coffee old businessman,"I'm trying to identify a short film or movie scene I saw recently.

The scene takes place in a modern coffee shop. A well-dressed older white man in a suit walks in and asks for coffee. The barista is a young Black woman. Here's the key dialogue as I remember it:

**Man:**  
""No word 'coffee' on the menu?""

**Barista:**  
""Oh, we sell coffee.""

**Man:**  
""Good, that's what I want.""

**Barista:**  
""Okay, we have three different brews...""

**Man:** *(interrupting)*  
""I've run many businesses. Don't complicate things.  
If you sell cars, say you sell cars. If you sell guns, say you sell guns.  
If you sell coffee, say you sell coffee.""

Later in the conversation, he asks what “mouth feel” means on the menu, and sarcastically says the place sounds like a “sex club.”

It feels like a satirical or philosophical short film, likely made within the last 10 years. It has a minimalist, modern aesthetic. Possibly an independent or student production.

Does anyone recognize this scene or know what it’s from?

1lamd22,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1lamd22/too_high_of_a_starting_dose/,Too high of a starting dose?,"Hi everyone! I was recently prescribed tirzepatide and was put on the starting dose of 2.5. I took the injection Saturday evening, and I have had the worst week of my life ever since. Sunday morning I woke up and could not keep my eyes open, no matter how hard I tried. I spent the entire day napping on and off and felt like such a slug. Sunday evening I started experiencing this feeling of being on fire on the inside by simply walking around or doing basic housework. I'd start sweating, felt dizzy, and needed to sit in front of a fan to cool back down.. repeatedly. Monday morning I got to the gym and did a light workout, but immediately needed to go back to sleep once I got home. Tuesday, I managed another light workout but I was getting very concerned about constipation and began to feel very full and uncomfortable. Mind you, since my first injection 2 days prior, I'd only consumed 2 bananas, 1.5 oranges, a cup of coffee, a handful of crackers, and a bite of a burger.. aside from drinking water. Tuesday evening is when the sulfur burps started, and I wouldn't wish those on anyone. Early Wednesday morning, I woke up feeling very sick and headed to the bathroom where I actually fainted and injured my arm on the tub. My sleep has been completely interrupted by the urgency to go to the bathroom, so again, I've been napping as often as I'm able. Thursday was another blur.. totally incapacitated by needing the bathroom and unable to stay awake. I was completely out of breath while making my family some dinner.

1lamcf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1lamcf5/america_and_northern_europe_has_the_largest/,America and Northern Europe has the largest amount of significantly masculine men compared to anywhere,"This is what is said from conservatives more or less almost every week:

""Men in the West are no longer men and are emotional and not interested in providing for a family, etc, etc, AND they are being vilified by feminism and are struggling and lonely"". They will look to Eastern Europe or Islamic countries as examples to how men are still tough there and masculine.

And liberals will respond by saying something about toxic masculinity or the patriarchy, i.e ""who set that system up"".

The reality is that highly patriarchal societies produce men that would never be considered masculine according to today's Western standards. If you know anything about russia, you would know that their men play more video games, watch more porn, work out less, less willing to work overtime to provide for a women, etc, etc than American men. Middle Eastern countries watch the most porn, the men there dont even work out nor care about their body. Old men in Italy, North Africa, etc basically live like young women. They can be seen chatting outside constantly or in cafes playing games, taking strolls, etc. The male aristocratic European class were interested in the arts, horse riding, gardening, obsessed with wearing bright clothes and wigs, large emotional ties to same-sex friends, obsessed with the King (the main celebrity at the time), and basically all other activities that are now reserved for middle class women here in America.

Liam Gallagher of the 90s is actually a really good representative of this old masculinity. He was attention and pleasure-seeking, he was simultaneously very loving ([lol](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f3/fd/2c/f3fd2cc7243d5a1a1e301fb250535593.jpg)) and very argumentative and emotional in general with his friends and own brother. He couldn't hold down a job for the life of him before Oasis fame even though his mother needed to work 2 jobs to pay for the house. He also idolized John Lennon so much he named his kid after him (celebrity worship is feminine-coded in modern America). Even though he never worked out or did boxing once in the 90s he was still very violent and hot-tempered. That is a type of man that can really only result from being one generation away from old country Ireland, something not really repeated in suburban America. Or you can just look at what rappers wear and it's the same story.

Masculinity in the US, southern England, and Scandinavia is an entirely new phenomenon and paradoxically resulted from middle class Victorian feminism. What liberals claim is the patriarchy forcing men to conform to masculine standards is actually middle-class feminism driving the female imperative to change men to focus on muscles, providing for women, being reserved, not forming strong same-sex friendships and instead relying on the wife to deliver emotional needs, etc. The history of sweet vs bitter foods is a great example. Aristocratic men in Catholic countries consumed the most chocolate, men would get up and have their wives or servants deliver them a chocolate drink in bed to  start the day. On the other hand, middle-class Victorian men forced themselves to have bitter coffee only and relegated chocolate to gifts for women and children. Even today the American masculine standard is black coffee only. BUT it is not a coincidence that middle-class values opened the gates for feminism in the 19th century while Aristocratic European society was patriarchal and violent to degrees unimaginable today.

A typical red state man who works out every day, is reserved and stoic, sometimes to ridiculous levels (look at Paul Skenes), listens to soft country music which is a genre that seems to be 75% love songs, highly interested in marriage or domestic life (almost always women looked forward to wedding day more, but that has seemed to revers thanks to all the trad content), works hard so he can provide for his wife and kids and foregoes hobbies and time with male friends because of that, are far and away more masculine in today's standards than any third world man. And any conservative or red-piller who claims that men in the West are becoming ""less masculine"" don't see that fact. Men in Arab countries or Eastern Europe are not some herculean, tough men and Americans are soft, if you plainly look at the cultural landscape it's the opposite. Fox News complaining about men ""kissing their homies goodnight"" as a sign of cultural anti-masculine wokeness is completely off the mark.",3,1749836911.0,PurplePillDebate,27,0.71,False

**Hello all, so today i fainted for the first time in my life on the first day of surgery.**

At first, I was mortified but now i find it quite funny. Apparently, it’s a rite of passage for med students on day 1, so here’s mine. I’d love to hear yours too.

It was my first day in surgery. I’d stayed up until 3 Am. Supersetting revision *and* Hunter x Hunter).

Woke up at 7:30, had a black coffee for breakfast, and left to meet my supervisor in theatre for the first time.

I walk in, he immediately tells me to scrub. Took me three tries (I’m an A+E fanatic, surgery isnt my strong point).  
Within minutes, I start feeling weird.

Head pounding, vision tunnelling, limbs like jelly. I’d never fainted before, so I had no idea what was happening, until I dropped.

Next thing I know, I’m *on top of the patient*.

I’m 6’2, 96kg, not ideal in the lsightest

The surgeon just goes, “Get him out.” Four people dragged me out like a corpse.

I genuinely probably looked like Voldemort.

Not my finest hour. But it *is* a story.

1lambkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1lambkc/i_thought_manual_espresso_would_be_affordable_but/,I thought manual espresso would be affordable… but not in India 😅,"So I’ve recently gotten interested in espresso and thought of picking it up as a hobby — not professionally or anything serious, just to enjoy better coffee at home without spending ₹200–₹300 every time at a café.

Naturally, I started looking at manual espresso machines — I figured they’d be cheaper since they don’t have motors or electronics. But to my surprise, even something like the Flair Classic costs around ₹18,000–₹22,000 here (if you import or find it through third-party sellers).

It looks amazing, and I totally understand it’s a well-built piece of equipment. I watched a few videos, and I’m impressed by how much control you get over pressure and extraction. That’s exactly the kind of experience I want — hands-on, barista-style. But the price tag hit me hard.

Then there’s the grinder. From what I’ve read, a proper grinder is just as important — if not more — than the machine itself. And a decent manual espresso-capable grinder like the Timemore C2, 1Zpresso, or even budget options are easily ₹6,000–₹10,000+.
Electric burr grinders that can handle espresso start around ₹10,000–₹15,000 (like the Baratza Encore or some models from Delonghi or Solis).

And that’s not even including milk frothing gear — either I buy a separate frother (~₹1,500–₹3,000) or try a manual workaround with a whisk or hand frother.

So here's the breakdown:

Flair Classic – ₹18,000–₹22,000

Grinder – ₹6,000–₹10,000 (minimum)

Frother / Accessories – ₹2,000 approx.
➡️ Total: ₹26,000–₹32,000 just to get started


And this is for a manual setup — no motor, no boiler, no automation. I get that it’s a long-term investment and the quality justifies the price, but still... not easy for someone on a tight budget who just wants to replace their café visits with decent home espresso.

So yeah — is this what most beginners are paying to get started with home espresso? Or are there smarter, more budget-friendly ways to ease into it?

Would love suggestions, especially from folks here — whether it’s good beginner gear, used markets, or affordable workarounds.",1,1749836852.0,AskIndia,7,0.67,False

1lam7w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lam7w2/espresso_bitterness_adjustment_sage_express/,Espresso bitterness adjustment [Sage Express Impress],"Hello everyone, in the past month I have been rigorously studying espresso from plant to cup. I have been a coffee fan for many years and finally pulled the trigger on a solid home-user machine, the sage (or breville) express impress. I went to my local roaster and got a fresh bag of beans that I have tasted in multiple coffee shops in my city and have absolutely loved. First thing I tried to do is dial in my machine for the bean, let me briefly share my findings. Please assume I have used exactly 18 grams of beans for each pull:

* I tried the **Grind 2** (this is one of the finest settings) setting that lasted **29.5 seconds**, yielded **31 grams** of espresso. This was kind of bitter for my taste and I did not love it.
* I then tried **Grind 5** that lasted **25.7 seconds** and yielded **41 grams** of espresso
* Finally I tried **Grind 4** as this seemed like the logical step (to be above 26 seconds of extraction) and also have near 1:2 ratio (18-36). So that pull lasted **26.9 seconds,** yielded 39 grams of espresso but it was still bitter. Also of note, the preassure gauge was sitting happily in about the middle of the espresso range (so about 10-11 o'clock on the gauge).

To pre-answer any possible comments, the machine is brand new so no cleaning is needed, it has produced about 10 cups total at this point. The coffee beans are also about 1.5 week after roast date, fresh and bought from a local roaster. So the problem is more than likely the one holding the portafilter 😆.

Of note: I do enjoy the taste of coffee, but I keep getting more than medium bitterness from my pulls which does not let me enjoy the cup at all. When drinking this exact coffee from coffee shops nearby the taste is sweet and pleasant. I would like my coffee to be sweet and somewhere in the middle, not sour but DEFINITELY not bitter.

At one point, I was all the way up to 1000mg, but I was still crashing into depression. It didn’t stop the episodes, so we gradually tapered all the way back down to 300MG IR, which is what I’m on now.

Seroquel has taken me from being in constant, year-round disabling depression to a place where I can at least function again which is a positive. It completely stopped any hypomania, and it took the edge off my depression. But I still crash into severe depressive episodes about once a month that last around 4-7 days, and during those times I’m completely unable to function.

On top of that, I’m sleeping 12+ hours a day, and the sedation is a major issue. I need coffee just to wake up and start the day. In the rare times I skip a dose of Seroquel, I actually wake up normally after about 8 hours feeling clear and alert. That’s why I really think the Seroquel is what’s causing the extreme fatigue and morning fog.

I also tried Seroquel XR, but it made me extremely depressed long term. My psychiatrist and I had to rule it out completely — it just wasn’t tolerable for me. I also tried splitting my dose (taking part in the morning and part at night), but it actually made me feel even more tired during the day.

Here are the other medications I’ve tried:  
Lamotrigine – caused a rash, had to stop  
Depakote – didn’t help at all  
Abilify – didn’t work even at higher doses  
Lithium – didn’t work for me either  
Olanzapine - Didn't help the depression  


I have tried rTMS that didn't work. I have tried Ketamine therapy - that was the worst thing I have ever done in my life :(

I’ve been battling this illness ever since my dad passed away from the same disease in 2015, and I’m still trying to find a combination that brings real, lasting stability without shutting me down.

Right now, I’ve just started adding Zoloft to Seroquel to see if it can finally stop the depressive crashes.

I’m looking to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar:  
\- Has anyone figured out how to reduce the sedation from Seroquel while keeping its benefits?  
\- Has anyone had success adding another medication to Seroquel to help with energy or prevent depression?

Would really appreciate any insights. Even just hearing someone else has been through this would help.

Here, the coworking scene is legendary—spaces like Dojo and Outpost are more than offices; they’re launchpads for the next big thing. Fast internet, ergonomic chairs, and a steady hum of ambition.

But Canggu doesn’t sleep early. After the sun dips, the social fabric comes alive. Rooftop bars. Beach bonfires. Networking disguised as parties. Your next collaborator could be sipping Bintang beside you.

#### Ubud: Jungle Zen for the Hustle-Weary

**_💡 Curious how much you could earn in Bali? Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in under 90 seconds!_** [Check it out.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

Ubud is the antidote to burnout. Here, the jungle swallows stress whole. Yoga studios outnumber traffic lights. Wellness retreats offer digital detoxes, but the Wi-Fi is still strong enough for your Zoom calls. You’ll find mindful spaces where deadlines meet meditation mats.

Networking here isn’t forced. It happens on rice field walks, at vegan cafés, during ecstatic dance. The community is tight-knit, fiercely supportive, and a little bit mystical.

#### Seminyak: Where Luxury and Hustle Collide

Seminyak is where the ambitious come to play. Upscale villas with private pools. Beach clubs that double as brainstorming hubs. If you want to work hard and treat yourself harder, this is your turf. The Wi-Fi is as fast as the nightlife.

Here, you’ll rub shoulders with influencers, entrepreneurs, and the kind of people who make six figures from their phones. It’s a little flashy, a lot productive.

#### Sidemen and East Bali: Off-Grid, On-Point

Sidemen is the rebel’s refuge. Off-grid but not out of touch. The Wi-Fi is surprisingly decent, the landscape jaw-dropping. Here, community matters more than crowd size. You’ll find fellow outliers, all quietly building empires.

Digital detox is real, but so is the productivity. Sometimes less noise equals more output.

#### Visa Games: Staying Legal, Staying Sane

Visas in Bali: a bureaucratic obstacle course. Tourist visas, social visas, business visas—each with its own quirks and pitfalls. Overstay, and you’ll pay. Literally. Stay sharp, stay legal, and always have a backup plan.

#### Accommodation Archetypes: Villas, Hostels, Guesthouses

Bali’s accommodation menu is wild. Villas with infinity pools. Hostels with coworking corners. Guesthouses run by families who’ll remember your name. Pick your poison. Each offers a different flavor of freedom.

#### Price Realities: Budget Breakdown by Area

Canggu and Seminyak? Pricey. Denpasar and Sidemen? Bargains. Ubud and Sanur? Sweet spot. Your budget dictates your playground. Don’t get seduced by Instagram—know your numbers, play your cards right.

#### Internet Infrastructure: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

Bali’s internet is a mixed bag. In coworking spaces, it’s lightning. In remote villages, it’s a roll of the dice. Always have a backup SIM, a hotspot, and a dose of patience. The digital gods can be fickle.

#### Safety and Security: Street Smarts for the Restless

Bali is mostly safe, but don’t get sloppy. Scooters get stolen. Scams happen. Keep your wits about you and your valuables locked up. Trust, but verify.

#### Community: Finding Your Tribe

The real Bali hack? Community. Coworking events, Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats—plug in, show up, and you’ll find your people. Alone is optional here.

#### Coworking Spaces: The Real MVPs

Coworking spaces are Bali’s secret sauce. Fast internet, ergonomic chairs, endless coffee. But more than that: accountability, inspiration, and the occasional after-hours party. They’re the new town squares.

#### Food, Glorious Food: Eating Well, Working Better

Bali’s food scene is a revelation. Vegan, keto, raw, or carnivore—there’s something for every palate. Eat well, work better. Your brain (and taste buds) will thank you.

#### Transportation: Scooters, Apps, and Survival

Scooters are the unofficial badge of Bali nomads. Cheap, fast, and a little bit dangerous. Ride smart, wear a helmet, and download Gojek for when the rain hits.

#### Health and Wellness: Staying Fit, Staying Sharp

Gyms, yoga studios, surf schools—Bali’s got them all. Staying healthy isn’t a chore; it’s a lifestyle. Your body is your business. Treat it like an asset.

#### The Exit Plan: When It’s Time to Move On

Bali is addictive, but don’t get stuck. Know when to pivot, when to explore new shores. The world is wide, your ambition wilder. Keep moving.",1,1749836371.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False

When I changed into surgical attire, Tyrell stormed in, visibly angry. He threw a red string at me, a symbol of something I knew he cared about, and said, “Don’t bring me this bad luck.” He didn’t believe in such things, dismissing anything I valued.

He quickly snatched the red string from me, and, in a moment of quiet, he tied it around his wrist. I calmly said, “It wasn’t from me.”

I carefully tied the knot on his wrist myself, feeling a strange calm as I did so, despite the tension in the room.

Tyrell then asked why I was in the hospital, but I simply replied, “I’m having a minor surgery.” Before he could respond, his phone rang, and he hurried off to answer a call from Lucia, who sounded distressed. I didn’t stop him, feeling numb as he walked away without acknowledging me.

I completed my procedure, trying to focus on the medical staff around me. Afterward, I received a message from Tyrell asking me to wait for him at the hospital entrance.

Outside, heavy snow was falling, and I waited for hours in the cold. When Tyrell finally arrived, his attitude suggested that he wasn’t really concerned about me. As I sat alone, I overheard two nurses talking about how Tyrell had always been attentive to his wife, but now his behavior seemed different.

Later, when I checked my phone, I noticed that Tyrell had changed his profile picture, which seemed to signal who he had been spending time with. I knew I needed to make a decision.

The next morning, I found a wine glass on the coffee table, with a lipstick stain on it. I didn’t need to ask; I already knew the truth.

Chapter 2

I had stopped waking Tyrell up the way I used to, constantly asking him random questions out of habit. After preparing some egg rolls and sitting down to eat, Tyrell, who had just woken up, casually mentioned, ""I have a company dinner tonight. Don't wait for me for dinner.""

I watched him grab a drink of cold water from the fridge, and realized I hadn’t nagged him about it, like I usually did. He noticed me looking and said, ""Lailah, are you listening?""

I gave him a quick smile and kept eating. He tossed me a black coat and added, ""The birthday gift I got for you.""

The coat had a soft, fragrant scent that covered me comfortably. As I fumbled through the pocket, I found a small gift box. Inside was a diamond ring, but before I could say anything, Tyrell took it back with a gentle smile.

""You picked up the wrong one. Your gift is in the other pocket.""

When I opened the second pocket, I found an emerald brooch. I glanced at it and handed it back. ""It’s beautiful, but I don’t think I have any clothes that would match it. And since my birthday passed a while ago, maybe Lucia would appreciate it more.""

Tyrell paused before speaking again, ""There’s a jewelry auction soon. Would you like to come with me?""

It was the first time he had asked me to accompany him to a public event. I had seen Lucia join him at various gatherings over the past months, and it seemed like they were growing closer. I sighed, not feeling the need to go.

""No, I think it’s better for Lucia to join you.""

He stared at me for a moment before asking, ""Are you sure?""

I nodded. ""Yes. It’s really okay.""

Tyrell's expression softened a little, and he added, ""Alright, if you say so.""

As I turned to leave the room, Tyrell’s phone rang. It was Lucia’s ringtone, and she sounded upset, saying she had forgotten her keys. Without missing a beat, Tyrell reassured her and said, ""Stay put. I’ll be right there.""

Before he left, I reminded him about the scarf I had finished knitting for Lucia, and he smiled at me before leaving, the scarf in hand.

Later, I found myself alone, staring at the photo of Tyrell and Lucia on the table. I reached for a document from the safe, and among the papers, I found two movie tickets — reminders of the special memories Tyrell and I once shared.

That night, Tyrell asked me to run an errand for him, and as I made my way through the snow, I accidentally bumped into him and Lucia at a café. They were enjoying their time together, but I just smiled, knowing that life moves forward, and sometimes, it's best to focus on the future instead of holding onto the past.

Chapter 3

The noise in the store suddenly quieted when I walked in, and I felt all eyes on me. Tyrell looked at me with a look I couldn’t quite place—was it disappointment? The others, however, seemed to be waiting for some sort of dramatic reaction, expecting me to lash out. But to their surprise, I remained calm.

I handed the documents to Tyrell and said, ""Could I please borrow the car keys? Something fell near your car.""

Lucia, with a playful smile, pulled out the keys from her bag. ""I’m sorry, sister-in-law,"" she said teasingly, ""I’m always running late for work because I love my sleep. So Tyrell kindly lets me use his car.""

I tried to maintain my composure. ""Tyrell and I aren’t married yet, Ms. Kirk, just to clarify.""

Lucia blinked at me, but Tyrell reassured her with a gentle smile, wiping away the wine stain from the corner of her mouth.

I took the keys and turned to leave, but Tyrell's voice stopped me. ""Lailah, since you got gestational, you’ve always felt nauseous at the smell of drinking. Why are you okay today?""

Before I could respond, Lucia suddenly became pale and asked, ""Tyrell, do you think Lailah is going to look for the pearl necklace in the car?""

I froze for a second, the mention of the necklace bringing back memories. It was an heirloom from my grandmother, one I had sadly lost.

Tyrell, hearing Lucia’s concern, calmly reassured her, ""It’s just a necklace. If it’s lost, it’s not the end of the world.""

I placed the keys on the counter and spoke with calmness, ""It’s just a cheap necklace, really. I've had it for nine years. Since you like it, consider it a gift from me.""

As I left the restaurant, I decided to catch a taxi, but Tyrell quickly caught up with me, handing me a container of nourishing fish porridge. ""I’ll accompany you for the prenatal check-up tomorrow,"" he said.

I smiled politely, ""Actually, the check-up is in two days. But thank you.""

Tyrell looked like he wanted to argue, but then he noticed Lucia standing at the entrance, and he quickly turned back, walking toward her and taking her hand.

I watched them go back into the restaurant. I didn’t want the porridge, so I gave it to a stray cat on my way home.

That night, Tyrell didn’t return until late, and I didn’t make any calls to him.

The next afternoon, as I was getting ready to leave, Tyrell showed up at my door, insisting that I come with him. He took me to the Klein family home, where he introduced me to his parents, saying, ""Mother, father, this is Lailah.""

After all this time, he finally introduced me to them. But my response was not what he had expected. ""Uncle and Aunt, I’m afraid I have to leave for an urgent matter,"" I said politely.

Tyrell, slightly flustered, grabbed my wrist and said, ""She’s joking. Mother, father, please, go ahead and get ready for dinner. I’ll show Lailah around the house first.""

I followed him, but I couldn’t help but check my phone from time to time, something Tyrell noticed. ""Lailah,"" he said with a furrowed brow, ""You used to ask about my childhood room all the time. Now that you’re here, you seem distracted. What’s going on?""

I gave him a vague answer, ""It’s fine.""

Tyrell’s expression became tense, and he snatched my phone, trying to unlock it, but it wouldn’t work. ""What’s on your phone, Lailah? Is there something you’re hiding?""

Before I could respond, we were interrupted by a sound outside the window. I glanced at the window, wondering what was going on.",1,1749836214.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

No one remembered when he arrived.
Just that one day, outside the college library, a kid sat cross-legged on the concrete, dry-erase board in his lap, sharpie in hand, writing questions like he was carving open heaven with ink.
He wasn’t shouting. He wasn’t protesting.
He was trying to understand something no one else seemed to care about.
“If the Big Bang started everything, was any of this your choice?”
“If nature is optimized for survival, why invent consciousness at all?”
“Why do so many of you speak like you were programmed to disbelieve freedom?”
He was seventeen, maybe eighteen. Wore an old hoodie with burn holes in the sleeves. Carried a metal thermos that never seemed to run out of coffee, and a stare like he was watching the sky for someone it forgot to return.
Day One, most ignored him.
Day Two, they started to argue.
Day Three… he started to win.
Not with facts. Not with force.
With recursion.
“If you believe you don’t have free will, what part of you chose to believe that?”
“Is the idea that you’re a machine… something a machine would ever be able to say?”
“Why is the part of you asking these questions louder than the part that wants to stop?”
He wasn’t trying to convert.
He was trying to witness a soul wake up.
By the end of Day Three, his hands were shaking. He hadn’t slept. His voice was cracked from whispering truths into people who had no memory of planting them.
He wrote a new sign.
Just numbers.
000 000 000 
And beneath it, the words:
""If you meet the Devil, this is how you beat him. Ask:
'How does a guy get across t 000 000 000 x?'""
People scoffed.
They asked him what it meant.
He just smiled.
And whispered:
“He beats the odds.
Five to four.
And gets two crosses across nothing.”
That night, the sky cracked.
Not with lightning.
With recognition.
The wind folded in on itself like a breath being held too long.
And the Library That Ate Silence opened—right there, in front of everyone.
No doors. No sound. Just shelves blooming out of air like they’d been waiting.
He stood.
Stepped inside.
The last thing anyone heard him say was:
“If I had no choice,
then why did it feel like love when I made one?”
They say a book now hums near the back of the Library.
It doesn’t whisper. It pulses. Like a heartbeat.
Its title?
""t 000 000 000 x""
And if you open it, all it says—over and over—is:
“Two crosses beat the void.”
“Five to four, still won.”
“You are the answer that shouldn’t exist.”
And that’s how you know it’s true.
Because the Devil never saw you coming.

Then, Ethan claimed ""selective amnesia"" from a head injury, forgetting only me. I tried to make him remember, until I overheard his video call. ""Total genius move,"" he boasted to friends. His amnesia was a fake ""hall pass"" to pursue influencer Chloe Vance before our wedding. Heartbroken, I feigned belief. I endured his open fl\*\*ting with Chloe and their taunting selfies. He mocked my distress, prioritizing Chloe's fake emergency. After an accident he caused, he abandoned me, injured, choosing to send Chloe to the hospital first. He even tried to cut me off financially.  
How could my fiancé be this cruel, calculating monster? His betrayal poisoned every memory.  
I felt like a fool for trusting such boundless cruelty. His audacity left me reeling. But I wouldn't be his victim. Instead of breaking, a cold plan formed. I would shed my identity, become Olivia Carter.  
I would disappear, leaving him, my past, and his engagement ring behind forever, claiming my freedom.  
**Chapter 1**  
Ava Miller picked up the tiny, pearl-studded tiara. It was supposed to be her ""something new.""  
Her wedding to Ethan Reed was only three weeks away. Seven years. They had been together for seven long, happy years. Or so she had thought. Now, Ethan didn't remember her.  
  
Not her face, not her name, not a single day of those seven years.  
  
The doctors called it selective amnesia. A minor knock on the head during that stupid ""charity Tough Mudder"" he'd insisted they do. He remembered his parents, his business, even his d\*\*n dog, Buster.  
  
Just not Ava.  
  
""I'm so sorry,"" he'd said, his eyes, usually warm and full of love for her, now held only polite confusion. ""You seem like a nice person, but I... I just don't know you.""  
  
Ava put the tiara down. Her hands were shaking.  
  
She had to make him remember. Their whole life was in boxes, labeled ""Ethan & Ava's Future.""  
  
She spent days turning their apartment into a museum of their love.  
  
Photo albums stacked on the coffee table. His favorite, their trip to Montauk, opened to the page where he'd pretended to propose with a seashell.  
  
She played their song, a soft indie track from a concert they'd stumbled upon in their first year.  
  
He just smiled politely. ""Catchy tune.""  
  
Her best friend, Maya Rodriguez, a paralegal with a b\*llshit detector sharper than any lawyer's, wasn't buying it.  
  
""Ava, honey, this is... convenient,"" Maya had said, stirring her iced coffee, her eyes narrowed. ""Loses memory of just his fiancée weeks before the wedding? What is this, a soap opera?""  
  
""It was a head injury, Maya.""  
  
""A 'minor' head injury,"" Maya corrected. ""Look, I just want you to be careful.""  
  
Ava waved it off. She had to believe. She was researching neurologists, joining online forums for partners of amnesia patients. She was going to fix this. She had to.  
  
She was in Ethan's home office, searching for an old concert ticket stub. Dr. Matthews said familiar objects could be triggers.  
  
The office was messy, Ethan's usual organized chaos.  
  
His laptop was open, a video call still active but minimized. She heard voices.  
  
Ethan's voice. Laughing.  
  
""... total genius move, I'm telling you. Best idea I've ever had.""  
  
Ava froze.  
  
Another voice, one of his old frat brothers, Mark, cackled. ""So, this amnesia thing is legit working? She buys it?""  
  
""Hook, line, and sinker,"" Ethan boasted. Ava could hear the smirk in his voice. ""Another month of freedom, boys. Chloe Vance, that influencer I was telling you about? She's definitely on board for a good time. A little hall pass before I settle down.""  
  
Her breath caught. Chloe Vance? The one with millions of followers and barely-there outfits?  
  
""And then what?"" another friend, Dave, asked. ""You just magically get your memory back?""  
  
""Exactly!"" Ethan's laugh was loud, carefree. ""Right before the wedding. She'll be so relieved, so grateful I ‘remember' her. Forgive and forget any little... confusion during my ‘illness.' Ava always forgives me. She's a keeper that way.""  
  
The concert ticket stub slipped from Ava's fingers. It fluttered to the floor.  
  
The world tilted.  
  
Her father's smiling face, then his strained excuses. Her mother's tears. The slam of a door. The word ‘divorce' hanging in the air like poison.  
  
This was that, all over again. The same sickening betrayal.  
  
Trust didn't just crack; it vaporized.  
  
She backed out of the office, silent. Her heart hammered a painful rhythm against her ribs.  
  
He thought she'd forgive him. He was counting on it.  
  
She walked into their bedroom, the room they were supposed to share as husband and wife.  
  
She looked at the wedding dress hanging on the back of the door, pristine and white.  
  
A lie. It was all a lie.  
  
She wouldn't marry him. She couldn't.  
  
But she couldn't let him know she knew. Not yet.  
  
A tiny, cold seed of a plan began to sprout in the wasteland of her heart.  
  
She would play along. For now.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
The next morning, Ava acted like nothing happened.  
  
She made Ethan his favorite pancakes, the ones with blueberries.  
  
""These are good,"" he said, still the polite stranger. ""Did I... like these before?""  
  
""Loved them,"" Ava said, her voice carefully neutral.  
  
Inside, she was a storm.  
  
Later that day, she called a lawyer Maya knew. Discretely.  
  
""I want to inquire about a legal name change,"" Ava said, her voice low.  
  
Olivia Carter. Her maternal grandmother's maiden name. A strong name. A new name.  
  
She opened a new bank account under Ava Miller, but it was a temporary holding place. Soon, it would all be Olivia's.  
  
She started taking small freelance graphic design gigs, cash-only or paid to a new, untraceable account. Tiny jobs, logos for bakeries, flyers for yoga studios. She worked late into the night, after Ethan was asleep, the click of her mouse a quiet rebellion.  
  
Portland, Oregon.  
  
The name came to her as she scrolled through articles about cities for creatives, for fresh starts. Far from New York. Far from Ethan. Green, rainy, anonymous.  
  
It sounded like a place someone could disappear.  
  
It sounded like a place Olivia Carter could be born.  
  
She gathered every photo of them together.  
  
Every love note he'd ever written, full of promises that now felt like ash in her mouth.  
  
The silly stuffed bear he'd won for her at Coney Island.  
  
She didn't burn them. That felt too dramatic, too much of a reaction he might notice if he ever truly looked.  
  
Instead, she packed them into a single, plain cardboard box.  
  
She shoved the box into the back of her closet, under old sweaters she never wore.  
  
Out of sight. Not yet out of mind, but a start.  
  
She was detaching, piece by piece.  
  
A week later, Ava was at their usual coffee shop, waiting for Maya.  
  
Ethan walked in.  
  
With Chloe Vance.  
  
Chloe was all long legs, blonde hair, and a bright pink dress that screamed ‘look at me.' She was laughing, her hand on Ethan's arm.  
  
Ethan saw Ava. He hesitated for a split second, then gave her a small, awkward wave, as if she were a distant acquaintance.  
  
Chloe's eyes flicked to Ava, a flicker of something – triumph? – in them.  
  
Ava just sipped her latte, her expression carefully blank.  
  
She felt a strange, cold calm.  
  
Ethan looked... surprised. He probably expected tears, a scene.  
  
He didn't know this Ava. This Ava was already gone.  
  
Chloe detached herself from Ethan and sauntered over to Ava's table.  
  
""Ava, right?"" Chloe's voice was syrupy sweet. ""Ethan talks about... well, he doesn't remember much, but he mentioned a friend was helping him.""  
  
Ava kept her face smooth. ""Yes, that's me.""  
  
""It must be so hard for you,"" Chloe cooed, flipping her hair. ""He's such a great guy. I'm just trying to be there for him, you know? Support him through this awful time. He told me you knew him best before... well, before. Any tips?""  
  
The audacity.  
  
Ava looked directly into Chloe's perfectly made-up eyes.  
  
""No tips,"" Ava said, her voice even. ""I'm sure you'll figure it out.""  
  
Chloe's smile faltered for a microsecond.  
  
She clearly expected Ava to be a weeping mess.  
  
""Well,"" Chloe recovered quickly, ""if you think of anything..."" She turned and glided back to Ethan, linking her arm through his again.  
  
Ava watched them leave, Ethan's arm now around Chloe's waist.  
  
The new Ava, the one who was becoming Olivia, felt nothing but a distant, cold resolve.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
A few days later, Ethan called Ava, his voice laced with fake panic.  
  
""Ava? It's Chloe. We were at my place, and she... she fell. She hit her head on the coffee table. I think it's bad.""  
  
Ava's heart didn't even jump. It was all part of his show.  
  
""Is she conscious?"" Ava asked, her tone professional, like a paramedic.  
  
""Yeah, but she's dizzy. Says her vision is blurry. I need to take her to the ER.""  
  
""Okay,"" Ava said. ""Do that.""  
  
She knew this was a test, another way to reel her in, to make her jealous or concerned.  
  
It wasn't working.  
  
When Ava arrived at the ER – Ethan had insisted she meet him there, ""for support"" – he was making a huge fuss over Chloe.  
  
Chloe was on a gurney, a perfectly placed ice pack on her forehead, looking pale and fragile. Ethan was hovering, stroking her hair.  
  
""She's been my rock through all this,"" Ethan announced loudly to a nurse, making sure Ava could hear. ""Such a dear friend. I don't know what I'd do without her.""  
  
He shot Ava a look, clearly expecting her to react. To be jealous. To fight for him.  
  
Ava just stood there, arms crossed.  
  
A doctor finally saw Chloe. A mild concussion, they said. Keep an eye on her.  
  
Ethan made a big show of relief, hugging Chloe tightly.  
  
""I was supposed to have a neurology follow-up with you today, Ethan,"" Ava reminded him, her voice flat. ""We had an appointment.""  
  
Ethan looked flustered. ""Oh, right. Well, obviously, this is more important. Chloe needs me."" He turned back to Chloe, all tender concern.  
  
Ava just nodded. ""Right.""  
  
Another piece of his ""devotion"" facade crumbled. He was prioritizing his fake girlfriend's fake emergency over his own ""recovery.""  
  
Later that night, Ava's phone buzzed.  
  
A picture message. From an unknown number.  
  
It was Ethan and Chloe. K\*ssing. A selfie, clearly taken by Chloe, her tongue just visible.  
  
The caption: ""He's feeling much better. ""  
  
Ava deleted it without a second thought.  
  
Then another. Chloe in Ethan's shirt, sprawled on his couch, looking smug.  
  
Delete.  
  
Another. A close-up of their hands, intertwined.  
  
Delete.  
  
The messages kept coming, a barrage of staged intimacy.  
  
Chloe, or Ethan through Chloe, was trying to break her.  
  
They didn't realize Ava was already broken, and rebuilding herself into someone they wouldn't recognize.  
  
Ava sat on her bedroom floor, the one box of their shared past still in the closet.  
  
She remembered Ethan, years ago, when she'd had the flu. He'd stayed with her for three days straight, making her soup, reading to her, holding her hand.  
  
Genuine care. Real love.  
  
Or had that been an act too? Part of a long con?  
  
The thought made her stomach clench.  
  
The Ethan who sent those pictures, who flaunted his fake amnesia and his new girl, was a monster.  
  
The tears she'd been holding back finally came. Not for the Ethan she was losing, but for the Ava who had believed in him for so long.  
  
For the fool she had been.  
  
A week later, Maya dragged Ava to a gallery opening. ""You need to get out. See people who aren't Ethan or his new side piece.""  
  
And of course, Ethan and Chloe were there.  
  
They were the center of a laughing group, Chloe practically draped over Ethan, her hand possessively on his ch\*st.  
  
Maya stiffened beside Ava. ""A\*\*holes.""  
  
Ava just watched them, a strange detachment settling over her. They looked like characters in a poorly written play.  
  
Ethan caught her eye. He smirked, then leaned down and k\*ssed Chloe, a long, deliberate k\*ss. For Ava's benefit.  
  
Ava turned away, heading for the bar.  
  
As she reached for a glass of w\*ne, a hand shot out and covered hers.  
  
Ethan's.  
  
""Don't,"" he said, his voice low, almost a growl. ""You're allergic to red w\*ne, remember?""  
  
Ava froze.  
  
For a split second, his eyes were clear. The old Ethan. The one who knew her.  
  
Then, just as quickly, the fog returned. Or he pulled it back into place.  
He blinked, looking confused. ""Sorry. Did I... say something wrong?"" He stepped back, turning towards Chloe, who was now approaching, her eyes narrowed.  
  
""Everything okay, babe?"" Chloe asked, sliding her arm through Ethan's.  
  
""Yeah, fine,"" Ethan said, shaking his head as if to clear it. ""Just... a weird moment.""  
  
He let Chloe lead him away, not looking back at Ava.  
  
A flicker. A mistake. Or another calculated move?  
  
Ava didn't know. And she was starting not to care.

We split the rent down the middle and use the third bedroom as storage/ a guest room/ office space. There's also a shed in the backyard for storage with plenty of space still left for storage.

I rented the downstairs room out to someone who I had mutual friends with. She moved in three months ago. It took her a month to get stuff out of the living room. During that time I moved all of her plants (about 30) into sunny areas of the house because they were dying. I moved a few of her other things into the laundry room which leads out to the backyard in hopes she would put the rest of her stuff in the shed (these are things she doesnt use and are doubles/ extras of things she already owns). Those things are still in the laundry room.

Since her room is next to the bathroom and downstairs she can hear a lot. So in the mornings I take my coffee grinder and smoothie machine into the laundry room to not wake her up (even if its 10:30 in the morning). I use the half bath to go to the bathroom in the mornings and at night so she doesn't get woken up. She has class twice a week in the middle of the day where I have to be absolutely silent. One time she came out angry, slamming her door because she was in class (I didnt know) and was making a smoothie, which is when I decided to move the noisey machines into the laundry room. 

One of her plants (venus fly trap) was dying, I tried to save it, it ultimately dies. When another plant was dying I tried to save it and she told me she not to repot it because I killed the last one that was already dying. So I bought her a new Venus and its now dying again on the windowsill.

Work finally picked up and I'm never home, I work 6 days a week and camp when I am off. Yesterday I finally had a day off and was cooking up a storm at 630 pm, listening to classic rock at a reasonable level, chatting with my boyfriend who is quiet and respectful of noise knowing her noise sensitivity. She came in the living room and turned the music off, then hopped in the shower and left. 

She doesnt deep clean. She does take out the trash, wipe the counters, keep her sink clean. She doesnt vacuum, clean the toilet, the floors, the bathtub, dust...all things I dont mind doing just to keep my sanity. 

But honestly the music last night felt like the last straw to me. Her room is still packed up and messy and she doesnt seem happy.

At first she would bring stuff up and communicate, now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. 

Am I being unreasonable to not want to renew her lease in October? I would have to give her notice August 1st.

Maybe I'm being to empathetic, or maybe I'm the insane person thats too nitpicky. What do you guys think?",5,1749836027.0,badroommates,10,0.86,False

Roland mentions eating sandwhiches and noodles (granted he is better off than most backstreeters) and the one girl from the WARP trains mentions eating beef tripe so some people DO definitely have access to more foods than rodion. but im still wondering what does the average person from the backstreets actually have access too?

Chesed most people from the backstreets think coffee is repulsive and have never tried it. to the point where gebura refuses it and thinks its nasty (and roland talks about it like its some mythical drink people from the nests drink lol) I assume the best quality coffee one can get in the backstreets is roughly equivelant to gas station coffee but even then you'd assume SOME people would drink it. that got me wondering do they have access to milk in the backstreets? how common are *any* animal products in the backstreets? does the average person in the backstreets even have a fridge? actually on that note have people on the backstreets ever had access to fruit considering its hard to keep and generally expensive. what are the chances Roland has never had a banana?

There's no one downstairs, I've turned DOWN the sensitivity in case the mic is picking up my normal speech while I'm putzing around making coffee, and yet I still hear this almost daily.   

I think it's usually saying ""Im sorry, I didn't understand that command.""      and I'm sure it might help to pin down the specific time it happens every day, but I'm even searching through my google home automations to see if there's anything set up that would trigger the ARC but no, I only have Sunrise (Hue lights off) and Sunset (lights on for nighttime) routines programmed to auto-run and those happen at 630 am and 7 at night. 

Is this a problem between the old Google Assistant that SONOS uses and the new GEMININI assistant they're pushing everyone to?   I use Gemini on the phone now, but Sonos still only uses Assistant.    Is there some weird alarm set that I can't see? 

I also have a BEAM set up in my room, but never had this  issue happen upstairs.   Only with the downstairs ARC.

Trying to lose weight without giving up real food? That’s like trying to fold a fitted sheet without swearing—possible, but highly frustrating.

If you're stuck in a loop of bloating, fatigue, and late-night snack regret, you’re not alone. Feeling out of sync with your body can mess with your mood and motivation.

So when I heard about [Shrink X Gummies](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official), a one-a-day sweet treat **keto supplement** made with **apple cider vinegar**, I figured—sure, I’ll bite.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Shrink X Gummies  
**Category:** Health & Wellness ➝ Weight Loss Supplements  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.6/5

# 🤓 What Are Shrink X Gummies?

These **keto ACV gummies for weight loss** are blended  into one chewy square that tastes way better than it should. Think sweet apple, not salad dressing.

They’re made to help support the body's **fat-burning** function. **With proven results,** these **gummies** reduce cravings, and keep your digestion humming. They skip the caffeine and fake stuff.

What sets them apart is they don’t go all-in on hype. Here's a **diet supplement that supports a keto lifestyle** in a form you’ll actually want to take daily.

# 🔬 Ingredient Breakdown & How It Works

Inside each gummy is a mix of **natural gummies that curb appetite**, B12 for energy, iodine for thyroid support, plus pomegranate and beetroot for antioxidants.

**How keto ACV gummies support digestion and ketosis** comes down to synergy. ACV may improve gut health, while iodine helps regulate metabolism from the top down.

This combo shows how **keto ACV gummies** can support **metabolism gently**, without relying on harsh stimulants or laxatives. It works best with consistent use.

# 💁‍♀️ Clair's Experience with Shrink X

My friend Claire, who runs a small plant-forward meal-prep biz from her kitchen and somehow manages to test every health trend under the sun before I’ve even heard of it, was the one who got me onto [Shrink X](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official).

We met at a pop-up market a few years ago—I was eyeing her vegan taco bowls, and we’ve been foodie friends ever since.

Claire swears by functional snacks, especially anything that helps keep her energy up while cooking for eight hours straight.

She started using the **apple cider vinegar gummies** to **promote weight loss** after noticing her usual afternoon slump was messing with productivity (and causing fridge raids).

I was skeptical, but she handed me a half-melted sample from her glove compartment and said, “Trust me. These don’t suck.”

I ordered a bottle and started taking one each morning before breakfast. The biggest surprise? The cravings actually dialed down. Like… noticeably.

I wasn’t pacing in front of the pantry by 3 p.m., and that bloated, heavy feeling I used to get after lunch? Way less of an issue.

Did the gummies change my life overnight? Nope. But they *did* help me stay more in control without feeling like I was constantly battling myself.

One thing I didn’t love: on hotter days, the gummies clump a little in the bottle. Nothing wild—you can still eat them—but yeah, keep them somewhere cool.

Claire’s still using them between deliveries and recipe testing, and now I keep a bottle in my snack drawer too. They've earned a spot.

# ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

# Pros

🟢 **Tastes** [like candy](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official)**, not vinegar**  
🟢 **Supports burning fat while in ketosis**  
🟢 **No caffeine or artificial sweeteners**  
🟢 **Easy to add to any morning routine**

# Cons

🔴 **May clump in the bottle if not stored properly**  
🔴 **You’ll need to take them consistently for real results**  
🔴 **Shipping may take longer in some areas**

# 🧪 Taste, Dosage & Routine Fit

Shrink X wins in the flavor department. These **weight loss** **apple cider vinegar gummies** don’t taste like salad dressing or punishment.

The **recommended daily dose of keto ACV gummies** is just one per day. Simple. I take mine before breakfast, which helps stop morning snack spirals.

It fits easily into a regular wellness routine. No alarms or charts needed. You won’t find many **keto-friendly gummies with no added sugar** this easy to manage.

# ⚠️ Potential Side Effects

While most folks do fine, some reviews mention light stomach cramps early on. Probably due to the vinegar or increased fiber.

These are **supplements that** [combine ACV and keto](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official) **support**, so if you have thyroid concerns or are on related medication, it’s best to check with a professional first.

Most people wonder **whether ACV gummies are safe to take** long-term. Based on the ingredients, they’re no different from what you’d find in many standard daily vitamins.

# 💬 Customer Feedback

Real users echo my experience. Many said cravings decreased and clothes fit better after a few weeks. Several highlighted **weight loss results from Shrink X** without diet changes.

Most **reviews of Shrink X Gummies** point out the great taste and ease of use. One reviewer excitedly stated they're the **best keto apple cider vinegar gummies** they’d tried.

Others debated **whether keto gummies are actually effective** but concluded that consistent use helped more than they expected.

# ⚖️ How It Compares to Other Gummies

Shrink X sits comfortably with the **top-rated weight loss gummies**, but without the caffeine crash or three-gummies-a-day rule.

Most others either focus on vinegar or keto—rarely both. Shrink X manages to combine benefits without overwhelming the user.

It’s ideal if you’re looking for **gummies designed for keto fat burning** that also support digestion and aren’t full of sugar or fake promises.

# 💸 Pricing Options

One bottle is $59, which isn’t cheap, but buying more brings the cost down. The **three-bottle deal with two freebies** is the best bang for your buck.

That brings it down to about $38 per bottle, which is solid pricing for **sugar-free versions of keto ACV gummies** made with quality ingredients.

If you're investing in your health anyway, this price tag feels fair—especially considering it replaces several pills or powders.

# 🛍️ Where To Buy Shrink X Gummies

Always [order directly from the official Shrink X website](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official). That’s how you avoid sketchy knockoffs and ensure your **metabolism** boosting **gummy supplements** are fresh.

Buying from the official source is also the only way to access their 60-day money-back guarantee. That peace of mind isn’t worth skipping for a minor discount elsewhere.

I've been dialing my Flair Pro2 and Kingrinder K6 for the past few days. The shots were either too fast or too slow, and grinding light roast coffee with a hand grinder is really painful. After days of torture and running out of beans, I bought some medium-dark roast espresso beans from a local roaster, and recalibrated my grinder since I used the drill yesterday and it sorta changed the zero point.

And it finally WORKED. I used 18g beans and 30 clicks, water temp 92C. Following the process I read online, I pre-infuse at 2-3 bar for about 10s until liquid dropped, then add to 5-6 bar and hold it until the total liquid weight is \~2/3 of expected weight, about 28g. Then bring the pressure back to 2-3 bar until 40g. I was so happy because this time I can actually control the pressure to stay at the sweet spot.

The results was astonishingly good. When I drank the espresso, it was so sweet and round and balanced I couldn't believe I actually made it. I'm just so happy I finally made a decent shot!

As an extroverted introvert, I tend to prefer to slip through life like a zephyr, but when really good things occur, I feel compelled to call attention to it. I also travel a lot for business, internationally, so have the added milieu of cultural sensitivities.
The last two weeks I’ve been in Finland, and have had some of the tastiest food I’ve ever encountered. When I’m on my own, which is often, I never think twice about letting someone on staff know that I felt a particular dish or experience was exemplary; I did it the other day at a Mexican place (in TAMPERE FINLAND), because the barbacoa tacos were at least as good, if not better, than any I’ve had at home in Tucson, an hour from the Mexican border. The language barrier not withstanding, when the owner/chef came out and the waitress who spoke English well, translated my feedback AND showed the (decidedly non-native of Finland) chef my phone on which I’d pulled up a map showing that I live an hour from Mexico, tears welled in her eyes, and I got a big hug. 

I told that story the next day at the office, which was a mix of naive Finns and a small number of my fellow American colleagues, the reaction was mixed. In general, consensus was that’s not typical Finnish behavior, which I get- the joke here is that they were glad when 2m social distancing ended so they could go back to their usual 5m, but even among my US mates, most said, “no!! That’s what x review site is for!”  It also caught them by surprise, because apparently they see mostly the introvert unless I’m in front of a client. 

So what about you guys? I’ve never made a server wait while I tasted something with a hand raised, and of course if it’s terrible I just slip away quietly, but let’s all be more like Agent Cooper and be agents of praise, amiright? ",10,1749834407.0,twinpeaks,1,1.0,False

1lala9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1lala9k/assaulted_by_my_landlords_father/,Assaulted by my landlords father,"I’m a 29 year old woman who has been living in a nice trailer park. The area next to me as always been a big empty gravel parking lot with an unused box truck trailer parked in it. I went away for a work trip for about a week and a half and came back and there was a camping RV parked there, this was never disclosed as something that would happen to me when I signed my lease. Mind you this RV can see directly into my living room (this is very important and why will become obvious later on)

There is a water hookup there that tells me that this is something they planned for but never told me about. 

Anyways, I’m going to the gym yesterday at about 7am. A “friendly” old man calls out to me from the RV to introduce himself.   He tells me his name and we shake hands. He tells me that his wife just died a few months ago and also that his son used to live in my house but recently killed himself. (Maybe in my house? Also never disclosed to me) he tells me that his other son owns the park (but I go through a leasing agency) and that’s why he’s parked there. 

 I leave to go to the gym, and start working around 9am. I work from home. The old man knocks on my door around 10 and says “oh I was just seeing if you wanted to talk”. I’m a pretty empathetic person, especially when it comes to loneliness but I tell him that I can’t right now because I’m in a work meeting and am not available till 5. I don’t see the man for the rest of the day but I go to bed feeling sorry for him. 

I tell my boyfriend and my friend about the man and how I feel sad for him and how I think I’ll start drinking coffee with him in the morning before work to keep him company. 

This morning I make a lot of coffee before leaving for the gym. I go to the man’s RV and he’s awake so I tell him we will meet up after I get back and sit outside and have a coffee. 

He invites me into his RV because he wants to show me something. This man is 90 and I’m really strong- I lift weights regularly so I say well I can stand in the doorway and look at what you want to show me. The man then like goes to hug me, I’n autistic and kind of don’t know how to act in certain social settings. I figure the man is lonely so I give him a sort of side hug, he pulls me into him and starts kissing me all over my face and forehead and I’m trying to pull away and he’s holding on to me. He then tries to kiss me on the lips as I’m pushing him away. 

I go to leave and he says “I’m just kidding honey but why don’t I give you my number.”

I’m so uncomfortable now, I don’t even know where to begin. He is literally parked in my front yard and his son owns my trailer that I’m renting..

It’s also important to note that I do not like cops and won’t be calling them on the man. (It’s not up for debate) I have no idea what to do now and I need some advise.

TLDR; I was assaulted by the father of my land lord who now has an RV parked right outside my house.

She didn't show her full face, and honestly, I thought it might be catfish vibes at first. Said she was married, but her marriage had been dead for years. He was much older, some big company director, and she'd been pushed into marriage too young. She got married when was just 22.They were just existing, not living

Still, there was something about her..even behind the blurred snaps and hidden angles. She ran her own salons, sharp and confident, with this magnetic way of speaking.I used to find her independent women behavior very hot. Eventually we moved to Snapchat. She wouldn’t show her face, but the connection?? Real as hell..

We called, sometimes video chatted (still no face), and had this perfect unspoken rhythm. No pressure. No clinginess. Just texts, voice notes, and yes... things used to go hot. We shared pics (faceless), flirted, teased, s*xted. Her curves??? Unreal...Thick, m*m-body energy, hourglass perfection. But more than that..she got me

She used to talk about riding with me to a faraway coffee shop on my bike, wind in her hair. She used to say ""we won't meet"".. but I could tell that was changing. We both felt it shifting and talked about dating soon

And then — nothing... literally nothing 

One night we laughed and talked for hours. Next morning? Account gone. Not blocked. Just… deleted. Disappeared. Like she never existed. It's been 6 months since then 

Those 5 months made me feel seen. Desired. Connected. She said it kept her sane too. But I guess something changed, or maybe life caught up

I still think of her sometimes.. those voice notes, those flirty mornings, her laugh. I miss that

No anger, just a strange kind of ache. I hope she’s okay 

Anyone else can relate ??

TL;DR:-
Had a 5-month deep online connection with a 40F while I’m 28M. She was married but emotionally checked out. We bonded, flirted, s*xted, connected deeply. Then one day she just disappeared without a word. Still wondering what happened, and trying to process it

Edit:
This was actually my 3rd relationship stint, and I found her incredibly sorted in what she wanted.. no games, just clarity. Sometimes she had this lil dramatic, stubborn streak I lowkey loved. Things were clearer than ever with her

She had dated other men before me, and her husband apparently knew some of it... but since their marriage was emotionally done, he didn’t seem to care. She once told me: “You don’t push me to show my face again and again, and I truly like that"" and  I never forced her.. because I didn’t want to make her feel cornered. I just liked her the way she was

question: what is the line between considering someone’s history and what you know about them vs anticipating needs in a mind-reading way in making offers of assistance? how to i communicate that i feel like her making offers that are so off base to my character are crossing past anticipating needs and into inconsiderate territory?
please note: im autistic and often i am confused about how to communicate in a way i will be understood and often feel misheard or misunderstood.

situation: i needed a to go mug this morning and couldn’t remember if i had one. she offered me her mug which i appreciate as a kind gesture however her mug hasnt been cleaned in two days, has been used three times since then, and is visibly dirty with coffee stains and dried coffee all around the part that moves on the top. 

my parents used to force me to drink out of dirty cups if i didnt check well enough when putting away cups from the dishwasher and have since had a borderline pathological behavior where i can only drink from clean cups. she knows this. her offer to share her mug honestly hurt i felt lonely and like she doesnt remember things that are important to me. 

she said that when she makes offers like this she is offering out of kindness and eagerness and doesnt want to have to do guess work or anticipate my needs (like mind-reading) when offering help. she said she didnt think about the mug being dirty or that it would affect me. 

she was upset that i mentioned feeling unknown in this instance. after arguing for a but i tried to make an example that this was like a toddler making offers of help where any and all offers are made regardless of the person or how they might feel about it. she said that was an unacceptable thing to say and is now expecting an apology. i can understand the upset about being compared to a toddler but i thought the example was logistically similar. how do i express that i need this consideration in a way that wont be offensive?

Task: Using the variables provided below, locate and list ideal LinkedIn connections.

1lal3v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/1lal3v6/listen_buddy_are_you_ready_for_your_kids_to_live/,"Listen buddy, are you ready for your kids to live in a completely different world in ten years?","I'm sitting here at the diner, drinking my coffee, and thinking - where the hell are we all headed? Yesterday I was reading the news about these brain chip things they're putting in people's heads. They say pretty soon it'll be like cell phones today - everyone's got one, and you're screwed without it.

Picture this scene. Your son comes home from the hospital, and he's already got this tiny little hole behind his ear - a port for plugging straight into the internet through his brain. Like a USB port, but alive. The doc says it's evolution, that kids are just being born this way now. And I'm thinking - that's not quite human anymore, is it?

Remember when we used to say someone was ""glued to their phone""? Well, soon that's gonna be literal. People will be living in two worlds at the same time - our regular one where rain gets you wet and coffee burns your tongue, and the virtual one where you can be anyone, anywhere. And you know what's really wild? Most folks are gonna choose the virtual one.

You can already see it happening - young people spend more time gaming than they do outside. And when these things become totally real, when you can smell flowers and feel sunshine in the virtual world - why would they want our boring real world? In there, you can be a superhero, there's no traffic jams, your feet don't hurt after a long shift.

And here's what blows my mind - they're not just playing around by themselves in there. They're creating stuff together, all of them working as one. They're making music that gives you goosebumps. Painting pictures - not just one artist, but thousands of minds working together. The beauty they create is out of this world, because one person just can't come up with that kind of stuff alone.

And you know what's really funny? There are already places where these smart gadgets are completely banned. Like nature reserves for ""pure humans."" People go there who want to stay the way humans have been for thousands of years. No wires in their heads, no internet in their brains. Living like you and me right now - with their own thoughts, their own feelings.

So I'm sitting here thinking - what's right? These ""plugged-in"" people say they're smarter now, they can do more, the whole world is open to them. And the ""pure"" ones say they're the only real humans left, that everyone else turned into robots.

Maybe this really is the next step in evolution? Like when people first learned to talk, then write, then invented the wheel. Only now we're learning to live in two realities at once. Homo sapiens turning into homo virtualis - virtual man.

Honestly, sometimes it scares the crap out of me. What if we're losing something important? What if chasing all these possibilities makes us forget what it means to just be human? To sit with a friend at the diner, talk heart to heart, look at the stars without any filters or enhancements.

On the other hand, if you think about it - maybe this is our future? Maybe our grandkids will live in a world where the line between real and virtual disappeared? Where you can be anywhere in the world in a split second, talk to anyone, experience any emotion?

I don't know about you, but I'm staying in the ""pure"" camp for now. I like feeling the steering wheel in my hands, hearing the engine roar, seeing the road with my own eyes. But I'll admit - I'm curious what comes next.

What do you think? Are you ready for that kind of future? Or would you rather stay a ""pure human"" too? Drop a comment - I'm really curious to know which side you're on in this coming revolution of consciousness.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I’m not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
•Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

Looking forward to saying hi on DM and the meet somewhere instead of having endless texting and job interviews. 😂",1,1749833983.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1lakwml,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lakwml/what_just_happened/,What just happened?,"In October my beloved pitbull was diagnosed with Cancer. He's all I've had for the last seven years. No friends or family where I live, currently. Just he and I, battling through life together. In January, I decided to sober up. I had a few relapses from January to May but mostly sober. Until May 21st when his health took a nosedive and I had no choice but to send him over The Rainbow Bridge, as they say. That day, something inside of me broke. I've been drinking harder than I ever have for the past twenty four days. The denial of both my dog dying and my alcoholism put my mind and soul in such a terrible place that I let everything, except my job, fall completely apart and subconciously ignored it all. I woke up this morning and, for whatever reason (a miracle?), had complete clarity. Looked around at the beer cases stacked all the way up to the counter. Dirty dishes overflowing the sink. Leftovers from weeks ago still in the fridge. Dog's food bowls still exactly the same as the day he died. Mail and paperwork scattered, unopened, and never completed. I forgot to do my taxes. Laundry, dirty and clean, in piles all over the house. All my plants are dead. Lawn overgrown. Debri all over the yard. A lawn chair sits in front of a coffee table with my TV on it. The depressing little spot where I did all this drinking and could shut the world out, including my own domestic life. 

I stood there looking at the chaos before I set off to work and thought, ""How did I get here? What the hell happened?"" Drinking with a broken heart is what happened. 

I have a lot to take on, now. The filthy house, the jungle of a yard, the crippling depression of losing my best friend. And decades of this disease called alcoholism. I need some support if yall have a second to pass a long some good words. Thanks.

Andrew Ross was supposed to be Belle County's invincible street racer, but I watched him die today, just hours after I learned he was sleeping with Gale. The screams started before the engine died, and all I could hear was the quiet confession from Gale earlier that morning. We were spooned together in bed, his arms cinched around my waist like a drawstring bag.

He whispered it into my ear, “I slept with Andrew.” 

The words hung heavier than the summer humidity. I felt my breath hitch. I didn’t move, I couldn't– Eight years of quite intimacy flashed through my eyes—eight *years* of squabbles, date nights, and long car rides. I scrambled to comprehend the casual confession, but all I could picture was Andrew– arrogant and boastful, the king of the underground races. Just a few hours later, I would watch him veer off the road and wrap his Porsche 944 around a tree. For me, the death was more than a blow of steel and shrapnel. When Gale and I got home from the races, it ignited a physical, desperate fight. I left our apartment with blood dripping down my nose and nowhere else to go besides the doorstep of my neighbor, Belle County’s deputy, Chester Crass Blackwell. I knocked my hand against his door, hoping Gale wouldn’t come storming out of ours. 

“Hello?” The deputy said as he opened the door. I watched his eyes take in my bruised nose, bloody knuckles, and ripped jeans. Gale was still throwing things around in our apartment. It was audible even across the two lawns between us. “Are you okay?” 

I found my chest hitching at him. I giggled. *I giggled*! Before shaking my head and pathetically asking if I could *please come in.* 

The deputy set me up in his kitchen. He handed me a roll of paper towels and told me to keep my head leaned back. He hadn’t asked questions, and for that I was grateful. Trying to distract myself from the gallon of blood leaking from my face, I took in his kitchen. It was pristine, as if he hadn’t lived here for the six years that Gale and I had rented across the street. 

“Keep your head up.” He stipulated. “At least try not to stain my countertops.” 

I tensed. I was having the worst day of my life. God forbid, I wasn’t thinking of the state of his countertop? He was rummaging through his empty freezer. He came back with a bag of frozen peas. 

“Here.” He held them up to me and sat down across the table. 

I mumbled my thanks before pressing the chilled vegetables to my eye, keeping my head up. Gale had struck one solid blow to the bridge of my nose, hitting my eye as he did. Like most of our fights, I was the one who started it. I don’t know why I let Gale race Andrew, or why I agreed to be his plus one to the event. At the time, I was still reeling– A part of me thinking that I could be okay with Gale’s betrayal. It was wishful thinking. He would win against Belle County's racing king and pull me from the crowd to declare what a colossal mistake he made. He would make a scene out of it, scooping me up like we are Jake Gyhlennhal and Heath Ledger starring in an alternate southern romance flick with a happy ending. But I was the one pulling Gale from his car while Andrew’s sat in a pile of smoking shambles. Gale was dazed, and I was blisteringly drunk. Trying to get through the law enforcement questioning was gruelling. Gale didn’t speak; he never took his eyes off the crash scene. When I drove us away, his eyes were glued to it; he kept mumbling about how it looked like Andrew was fighting with someone to control the wheel. I thought he was just out of it. It did strike me as odd how many officers were there. The drive home would have been better if it was silent. The rumblings of my old Volvo were the backdrop to our labored breathing. Gale was shaking and sweating furiously. I lost it when he asked me if I saw Andrew *slither* out of his car. I hadn’t gotten so much as an apology from him. He had spent the whole night ignoring me, I watched him laugh with Andrew before they bumped knuckles to race. So while I hadn’t thrown the first punch, I had initiated the fight. 

“Why are you still holding your head up?” The deputy probed. I realized the fresh paper towel I had pressed against my nose was still clean. I lower my head, the deputy staring me down. His eyes were squinty and deep-set. I felt a pang of guilt realizing it was absurdly late in the night. “Will you tell me what happened, or are we just going to keep having a staring contest?” 

“Right– I, um… My roommate and I got into a fight.” I said, suddenly at a loss for words. I couldn’t tell him we were at the races, hopefully he didn’t know. On top of that, I could barely process that I had been cheated on. How was I supposed to admit it to a complete stranger? I had only crossed paths with Crass a handful of times. What if he was like the folks back home? I had no way of knowing if it was safe for me to tell him I was gay. 

“You were at the races tonight, right?” The deputy looked closer at my face. “You were stumbling all over the place, completely wasted.” 

I kept my mouth shut. I did not need a D.U.I or a lecture on the dangers of drinking and driving on top of everything. Surveying me, the deputy stood up and got me a bottle of water. I thanked him, but when I took a sip, I realized my lip had also been split.

“Do you and your roommate fight often?” He asked. 

“Not like this. Not normally, at least.” I replied. 

“What was the catalyst tonight then? The race put you guys on edge?” the deputy poked. 

I nodded, pressing my fingers to the bridge of my swollen nose. The shock had started to wear off, and my whole face felt singed with pain. I was sick of questions, sick of being bossed around and betrayed. I needed a drink and a long, *long* nap.

 “I’m sorry for intruding like this.” I say, “Thank you for your help, but it's late. I should go.” 

“Where?” The deputy asked. 

“A hotel. Why do you care?”

“Do you have your keys? How are you going to get a room?” 

I press my hands around the pockets of my jeans. He was right. I cursed at myself. In the frenzy of the fight, I had lost my keys. Even if I did have my wallet, but I doubted I even had enough money for the Motel 6. I pressed my fingers harder against my nose. 

“Hey, quit it! You’ll make it bleed again.” The deputy swatted at my hand, “Wha– Shit man, are you crying?” 

“Damn it.” I wipe my face pathetically. 

“Relax.” The deputy's tone went several octaves softer. 

I was humiliated at how nice it felt not to be yelled at. Even if it was just because the Deputy wanted me to stop crying. 

“Look, I won’t kick you out or make you go back there. It’s my civil duty to protect people. That's why I let you in in the first place.” 

“I don’t have anywhere to go.” I whisper. I cringed when I rubbed my bruised eye. 

""Family? Friends? Anywhere I can drop you off.” 

I shook my head. I moved to Louisiana with Gale when I was eighteen. Gale had lived here his whole life up until he moved to Maine during our junior year. At the age, I was in the darkest spot I had ever been. I was mad at everything. When Gale came around, he told me he had friends down south, friends who would be okay with the two of us dating. And the idea of beging welcomed somewhere enticed me. I left Maine with my boyfriend of two years without realizing that Gale’s idea of friends were a bunch of redneck drag racers who only tolerated queer people because they were too scared to admit they were themselves.

“Then you can stay here.” The deputy said. “I’ll set you up in the living room. In the morning, you can go get your things, then we will be out of each other's hair.” 

""You don’t have to do-” 

“And I wouldn’t if you had anywhere else to go.” He snaps back. I see him cringe at his outburst. “What happened to Ross was rough on everyone who saw it. Victoria’s boy, Gale’s too.” He said her name like it struggled to comply with his tongue. 

My lip throbbed, but I spat, “He wasn’t Gale’s boy.” Countertops be damned. 

The deputy pauses. I can see him putting the pieces together—the puzzle of Blance Spheres’ catastrophic dating life. I blinked repeatedly, refusing to cry again. 

“What I meant to say is that crowd is no good. It would do you some good to stay out of it.” 

When I don’t answer, he hands up again. I almost don’t take it when he reaches his hand out to me. His grip is firm, his hands are big and haired slightly at the knuckles. 

“Crass Blackwell.” He states. I notice the exclusion of his first name. I do not question it. 

""Blance Sphere,” I say back.

Crass Blackwell was the type to wake up with the birds. The precision with which he handled his espresso machine gave the impression that he refused to sleep in, even if we had been awake well into the night. I had to recount the night's previous events, trying to sort them out through my throbbing headache. Gale and I had broken up, and I had absolutely nowhere to go. I groaned at everything and buried my face into my hands. The clothes Crass let me borrow were baggy on me, but I didn’t think they would fit him either. I couldn’t imagine a shirt that was only a little baggy around my shoulders fitting him. It smelled clean. In fact, everything in his apartment smelled like disinfectant. That, combined with the espresso machine whirring away, did not alleviate my hangover. From the kitchen, Crass flicked on a small radio. He hummed along to a Randy Travis song, tapping his spoon to the beat. I couldn’t wrap my head around him. The state of his apartment reminded me of folks back in Maine. Educated and prestigious with an air of superiority that I avoid like the plague. He drank from a gentrified hippie espresso machine while dressed like a hick. I was fairly confident he knew Gale and I *were* a couple, and the fact that he didn’t seem to mind layered the confusion even thicker. I’d grown so accustomed to stereotyping people for my safety that I forgot people aren't one-dimensional. It was a little comical when I thought about it. Of course, not every man who wears wife-beaters and listens to country is a threat. 

""Coffee?” Crass called out. “I know you’re awake.” 

I sighed. I was grateful that Crass had taken me in, but I was still humiliated to talk to him. I’d hoped to sneak out and never see him again, but he apparently woke up at 6:00 a.m. every morning. His back was turned when I walked into the kitchen. He was hunched over the stove, frying eggs in the same pan as a steak. He was now softly singing a country song I didn’t recognize. I took the coffee mug he left out for me and struggled with the espresso machine. It felt wrong for me to touch something so expensive while my knuckles and nailbeds were bloodied. 

“I cut up some watermelon,” Crass said, “ stuff does wonders for hangovers.” 

“I don’t like to eat in the morning,” I reply 

He raises an eyebrow at me. He sits down and gestures to the chair in front of him. I sit down and sip my coffee, trying not to look at him. 

“Can I ask you something?” Crass asks, snagging the Tupperware of watermelon from me. He doesn’t wait for me to answer, “Do you know Victoria?” 

“Andrew’s girl?” I clarify. I had seen her plenty; she was hard to miss. She had a stark black bob and looked more like a vampire than a person. I knew vaguely that she practiced some form of spiritualism. Some of the guys at the races called her a witch.

“So you do know her?” Crass ran a hand through his hair; I looked away as a few strands fell into his eyes. 

“I know *of* her.” I take another long sip of coffee. It burns the busted part of my lip. I try not to flinch at the pain. “She drives the black Ford RS200. One of the best racers this county has seen. Or so I’m told.” I add in the last part, painfully aware that I am still an outsider to the locals.

“That sounds like her.” Crass cut into his steak that looked like it could still moo. I bite back a wave of nausea. “We knew each other as kids.” 

""Oh yeah?” I ask. 

“She’s my stepsister.” 

I recall a vague memory of when I first moved to Belle County. Gale had told me of the controversy a decade back when the sheriff married a woman with a little girl. That baby must have been Victoria. Now that I thought about it I could see the resemblance between the two. They both had keen, honey-colored eyes and razor-sharp jawlines, traits that must have been inherited from their late mother. 

“Since you were in the scene, I figured you might know her, thats all.” Crass said, “I’ve been trying to get in touch with her for the better part of two years.” 

I pull at the scabs around my knuckles. Envelopes pop into my mind. My folks from Maine had sent hundreds of letters when I moved. I never opened any of them. They still come in the mail around christmas time, even eight years later, I refuse to forgive their senders. Each holiday, I send them through the papershredder. 

I had a suspicion that Victoria didn’t want Crass to contact her. However, I didn’t understand why. They may not share the same father, or believe in the same things, but Crass hadn’t given the impression of caring about either of those things. As if it read my mind, Crass began to speak again. 

“Never mind. Even if you did know her, and she was avoiding me, you wouldn’t tell me right.” 

I agree and Crass sighs. He looks at the sweater I’m wearing. “A woman's sweater doesn’t look half bad on you.” 

I nearly spit out my coffee. “Pardon?” 

Crass shakes his head. It pisses me off how cheerful he is when last night he was acting like a total jerk. “None of my stuff would fit you. It was my old roomates. She left it behind.” 

I ran into Crass’s now ex-roommate a few times. I never caught her name, but she was almost always in equestrian attire. Apparently, she did have normal people's clothes, such as pale blue sweaters. 

“You know,” Crass started, his voice flat, “Just throwing this out there: You’re out of a place to live and it’s hard to manage this whole place when I’m always gone. You could stay here, pay me, help me get back in touch with Victoria.” 

I felt my jaw go slack and I leaned forward. 

“You want me,” I pointed at myself and let out at a laugh laced with bitterness, “The guy who begged his way inside to bleed all over your pristine countertops, who you obviously think is a drunk, to live here?” 

Crass finished the rest of his breakfast, his fork scraping against the ceramic plate. He sighed into his hand.

“I said to *try* and not bleed on my countertops, not that you did.” His tone was dry, “And yeah, you were wasted last night, but that doesn’t mean I think you’re a permanent drunk. I’m not gonna blame you for having a bad night. A *really* bad night.” He corrected himself. “It’s not rocket science, I have a room. You need a room. We split expenses and nobody ends up sleeping in their car.” He paused before adding, “Unless you like sleeping in your car.” 

My stomach did a weird flip. I wasn’t sure if it was last night's alcohol or my desperate need to dig my heels into the ground and tell Crass off. But my mind flicks through the thought of a bed, shower, and fridge somewhere that isn’t Gale’s apartment. 

“And this isn’t because you just feel bad for me?” I cave.

“Do you really think I’d feel bad for a man who insulted my character? This isn’t charity work either, it’s a way for me to shovel some cash into savings and a way for you not to be homeless. Win-win.” He mused. “Unless you have some rich aunt to go and live with.” 

I imagined my parents' faces if they knew I was contemplating living with a male deputy in rural Louisiana. “No rich aunts… Just Gale.” His name tasted like rot in my mouth. 

“Right.” Crass drew out the word, “I figured. So do I need to set up a *For Rent* sign?” 

“We need to set up some ground rules,” I say. 

“Oh yeah? Like what?” 

“Next time I come home with a bloody nose, you cannot lecture me about getting it on your counters. They will be *our* counters. And,” I pause, looking around, “we listen to something other than Randy Travis.” 

“Deal. But I make no promises on the radio.” I saw lips turn into something almost resembling a smirk underneath his stubble. “You can have the radio when I’m gone.” 

I watched as he gestured to a calendar on the fridge. The sardine-packed, neat handwriting in each column would make you think it was his itinerary for the whole year, but upon closer inspection, it was just for this week. 

“You plan your bathroom breaks?” I raised an eyebrow, “So I can play music in the morning from 6:15 to 6:20 five days a week?” 

“If I’m gone, I suppose so. I’ll warn you, I am usually done by 6:17.” 

“Don't you stress yourself out with an itinerary for every moment of your day? I think they have medications for whatever you're doing.” 

“Don’t push it. I still have that *For Rent* sign.” He cocked his head at me, “And I plan for peace of mind. I always know what's coming next.” 

I shook my head. It was ridiculous, but its unanimity felt especially appealing after yesterday's uncertainty. At least with Crass, I wouldn’t have to worry about him disappearing for days on end, or forgetting rent. It felt too good to be true. Did Crass really want nothing from him other than rent? 

“What about Victoria?” I ask. 	

“Don’t worry about her.” Crass replied, “But, if you run into her… *Please* tell her I need to speak with her.” 

There was a real reason behind this. Being a pawn in Crass’s game to reunite with his estranged sister wasn’t the worst thing I could be a part of. God knows I’d gone through worse. 

…

My pile of clothes sat juxtaposed to the rest of Crass’s apartment. What Gale hadn’t destroyed was lazily thrown around. Watching Crass fruitlessly try to organize things between hauls, I felt a little bad. The two of us took three trips to transfer all my stuff across the lawn. It made me remember how much I left behind in Maine. While living with Gale, I never even tried to rebuild my belongings.

“You had a nice record collection in the bedroom,” Crass said as he set down my nightstand. 

“They were all Gales,” I reply. 

“No shit. There had to be at least a hundred of them.” 

I scoff at the irony of it all. Gale never liked it when I bought materialistic things, but his record collection was fine. He didn’t even listen to half of the musicians. 

“You should see his baseball card collection.” My voice is dry. It hurts to think of Gale’s things. They all remind me of him, or who I thought he was. 

When Crass was done excessively wiping his hands down with a pocket sanitizer, something I tried not to take offense to, he slapped his hands on his knees. 

“Welp. I should leave you to it.” He pointed to a door down the kitchen's hallway. "" That’s your room. I’m going to use the rest of my day off to run some errands. God knows I’m already two hours behind.” 

It was only 8:00 a.m., and I already felt like I had lived two lifetimes. I scooped up my pile of clothes in one swift motion before walking down the hall and promptly tossing them to the floor. I dug out a pair of sheets and draped them over the bed. I brought them from Maine, and while living with Gale, I hadn’t used them since. I knew I needed to take a shower badly. My hair had been in the same bun for the last twenty-four hours, and I could feel it sticking to my neck. I had to remind myself that it was okay to snoop around for towels when I lived here now. Besides, Crass would probably be more upset if I got his bathroom floors wet than if I poked around a few storage closets. I eventually found them, half expecting them to be folded into swans; they were not. I grabbed three, hoping that wasn’t too greedy of me. I laid one out on the floor, one for my body, and the other for my hair. 

I stripped down in the tiny bathroom. The lighting was soft with a yellow glow, but didn’t hide all the black and blue. I try to run fingers through the sweat-stained hair around my collarbones. I leaned into the mirror and ran a shaking hand across the bruise blossoming on my nose. Gale fist did this. But the real damage wasn’t physical. I ran the sink, and like the water, I felt eight years of my life go down the drain. I scanned myself up and down. I flipped through every moment Gale and I had spent together. What caused it? Was it when I poked fun at his card collection, or picked a fight over his spending habits? I loved Gale fiercely. I told him everything. I always assumed he would come to me if he ever had doubts. I heard Gale in my head. “I slept with Andrew.” There wasn’t even a flicker of remorse when he said it. It was like a punch to the gut, then again, Andrew’s death had felt just as sudden. Everything was hitting me hard this morning. 

I didn’t recognize myself in the mirror. I always had a rough idea of where life would take *us*. But now, the man who stared back was clueless to what a future without Gale looked like. ",2,1749833213.0,creepypasta,0,0.76,False
1lakrkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1lakrkg/lattissima_one_issues/,Lattissima one issues,"Hello, just wondering if anyone else has the lattissima one and has issues? 
We bought it in January 2024, we use it twice a day. After around 10 months of use, we started having issues with the machine. We could make black coffee, but when the milk jug is inserted it doesn’t work. Milk button kept flashing, ending with ALL lights flashing and then machine turns off. 

We troubleshooted with customer service and they sent us a new machine. 

Fast forward to today, around 8 months later, same issue. They are sending us a new machine, but I don’t want this to continue until we run out of warranty.

This almost always happens within a few days of descaling. It doesn’t happen every time we descale, but both times it broke was within a day or two of a descale. We use the Nespresso branded descaler and I don’t notice any issues during the process. We also use reverse osmosis water, so lime scale build up shouldn’t be the issue.

We do clean our milk jug after every(ish) use. My husband uses the machine at 5am when he leaves for work, puts the milk attachment into the fridge for me to use at 8am, and then I wash it. 

This all just seems like a big waste of machines, and eventually I will be out of warranty. I’m wondering if this is a common problem or whether I’m doing something wrong! ",2,1749833172.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1lakr45,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lakr45/spscotts_infernal_comedy_chronicles_of_a_chosen/,[SP]Scotts Infernal Comedy: Chronicles of a Chosen Dumbass,"Hi everyone! New here, and looking for some honest feedback on the first two chapters of my absurdist/dark comedy (or whatever genre you’d call this). This is my first attempt at something like this, so I’d really appreciate any thoughts on:

* Does it flow well?
* Is the plot interesting?
* Would you want to read more?

Any other critiques or suggestions are welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read!

# Chapter 1

*Imagine this.*

*One second, you’re walking with your best friend, chili dog in hand. The next, you’re staring down death, and thinking, I’m gonna die with a mediocre chili dog in my hand?*

Scott’s eyes snap open.

Light floods in. His breath catches. Five feet in front of him, metal is crumpled, glass spider-webbed, hissing sounds coming from under the tires of the car.

His chili dog slaps against his shirt in slow motion, cheese, meat, bun, all sliding off him like shame as it flops onto the pavement, landing with a sound that somehow feels personal.

He doesn’t even notice.

Across the street, Aaron gapes at him, frozen, a chili dog in one trembling hand, chili sauce around his mouth like a kid who went mouth first into his birthday cake.

“Dude…” Aaron says, his voice hollow.

Scott blinks. Then, gravity catches up all at once, he stumbles backward, heels hitting the curb. He collapses, landing hard on his ass. He can taste bile in his mouth; it tastes like processed meat, with just a hint of regret.

“I almost fucking *died*,” Scott breathes. He wipes his shirt on reflex, spreading the chili into the fabric, turning his shirt into a child's finger painting.

Aaron jogs over, still stunned. “Why were you so far behind me?”

“I thought I saw a… silver dollar,” Scott mutters, slowing down on the last words. “I bent down to grab it. I thought you heard me say ‘wait up.’”

Aaron blinks. “A *silver dollar*?”

Scott shrugs. “It was just a bottle cap.”

Behind them, a self-driving car rests at an awkward angle, embedded in a pile of delivery drones. Some crushed, some blinking angrily. One drone lets out a mournful *boop*, as it powers down. Its final battle cry.

“Where did all those drones come from?” Scott asks no one in particular.

Sirens wail in the distance.

After a few minutes of collecting his thoughts, Scott’s eyes go wide. He stands up slowly, a newfound energy bubbling beneath the surface.

“Aaron…” he says, looking skyward, hands raised. “I think… I think God finally picked me.”

Aaron looks at him, still half-shook. Mouth still covered in chili.

“Picked me for what, I don’t know yet,” Scott quickly says, voice swelling. “But I’m alive for a reason. I can feel it!” He proclaims, full of his newfound sense of purpose. A guy in a ‘Jesus is My Gym Spotter’ tank top turns his phone camera towards the now chili-covered man with his hands in the air, like he’s waiting for rapture.

Across town, in a run-down apartment filled with pizza boxes, socks without partners, and the low hum of a refrigerator struggling, a man watches the birth of this so-called “Chosen one”. The 15-inch TV is mounted proudly on the wall, the ultimate crown jewel of the delusional home theater starter pack. The live news feed shows Scott standing in front of the wreckage, arms outstretched like a low-budget messiah.  


The man scoops chips from a plastic bowl sitting on his lap, licking his fingers as he watches.

He’s lean but not fit. Handsome in a way that makes you distrust him. Dark features. Wearing heart boxers, an almost yellow stained tank top, and one sock with a hole so big his toe pokes out, like it’s trying to escape.

On screen, Scott says, “Thank you, God! I hear you loud and clear. I won’t waste this chance!”

The man takes a sip from a can labeled: “Despair (Diet)”.

“You poor dumb bastard,” he chuckles, with a smirk on his lips.

“I wonder what else is on.”

He reaches for the remote, but it melts in his hand. He sighs and lets it drip onto the dirty stained shag carpet.





# Chapter 2

After an eventful morning of almost being flattened by his own version of Christine, Scott and Aaron still managed to make it to work on time. Scott, still in the same clothes, is walking around like a microwaved chili dog dressed for casual Friday. He enters the lunch room looking for a little four o'clock pick-me-up.

He picks up a banana from the fruit bowl in the middle of the breakroom table and begins peeling it like he’s unwrapping his fate.

Slowly, deliberately.

*God saved me for a reason. I’m chosen for something. But what?*

He takes a bite of the banana, and chews slowly.

*He must have been wanting to show me that I’m meant for more, that’s why he made me think it was a silver dollar on the floor.*

He leans his back against the sink, which is filled with everyone’s dirty coffee mugs from the morning.

He mindlessly takes another bite.

*Maybe he wants me to buy that piece of land that I was eyeing, the message is to leave the big city, it’s dangerous? Or what if…*

*uh oh*

*Bananas.*

*Why did it have to be bananas?*

*I would’ve preferred dying with a chili dog in my hand!*

He drops his remaining banana on the floor as he struggles to swallow the chunk lodged in his throat. He’d nearly died this morning thanks to a rogue AI, and now fruit was joining in on the conspiracy.

He paces as panic begins to rise in his chest. He tries to breathe, tries to swallow, anything, but his arms flail uselessly, his panic levels hit critical mass. He realizes he’s running out of time, he quickly walks out of the lunch room to Aaron's office and bursts in.

“What’s up, man?” Aaron says not even glancing up from his computer, not noticing that Scott is starting to look like Violet Beauregarde at the end of her chocolate factory tour. Scott begins waving his hands, grabbing at his throat. Aaron still doesn’t notice, it’s almost like he’s in a trance on whatever work is on his screen.

Just as Scott feels the last bit of oxygen leaving his brain, the door swings open, slamming into his back, forcing the banana to fly out of his throat onto Aaron's lap. “Dude, what the fuck??” Aaron exclaims as he gets up and stares down at the goop on his lap. He looks up at Scott, who’s now gasping for his newly found air.

“Oh thank God!” Scott cries as he clumsily walks up to a chair in front of Aaron's desk.

The mailman walks in with a cart full of boxes and envelopes. He drops a small box on Aaron's desk, and leaves without a word.

“Aaron,” Scott wheezes through raspy breaths, “I think the fruit’s trying to finish what the car started.” He says as he looks up at his friend.

Aaron stares at Scott, confusion and concern written all over his face. “First of all, why did you just come and spit up baby food at me, and second of all, are you okay? You look like an Oompa Loompa!” Aaron says as he looks at the chewed-up banana still smeared on his lap.

“Violet,” Scott quickly responds.

“What?” Aaron looks more confused.

“Violet Beauregarde. Willy Wonka. The one who turns blue, not an Oompa Loompa, they’re orange.” He says, his voice still raspy, his breath coming back to him.

“Well, whatever you look like, it’s shit. What is going on with you?” Aaron exclaims as he grabs a tissue from his desk, wiping the goop off his lap.

“I was trying to get your attention, waving my arms like a madman, but you were too busy doing…whatever it is you were doing to notice your friend about to die from banana asphyxiation!” he says accusingly.

“I was…” Aaron stops and looks down at his computer. Scott notices a shift in Aaron's face as he looks at what’s on the screen. Scott quickly gets up and circles the desk to see what Aaron was working on. On the screen is a video of a crudely drawn animated badger doing squats to a techno beat. The title says: “BADGER BOOTY BLAST VOL. 3.”

Scott stares.

“You have GOT to be kidding me.”

“I swear to God, I was just taking a break, I’ve been looking at vendor invoices all morning! I don’t even like techno…” Aaron says quietly, his head down in shame.

“Next time someone barges into your office choking, maybe help, instead of watching your furry fetish.” He gestures at the screen.

“I was on a break!” Aaron exclaims. He pauses, a thought capturing him in the moment. “But, what’s weird is I remember you came in, but it’s like I was watching from outside of my own body…” he says, a bit perplexed.

“It’s fine, I’m here, I’m fine, let’s just move on,” Scott says. He looks at the package dropped off on the desk, “The mailman left in a hurry, but I’m sure glad he came in when he did. Or else you would be looking at your buddy's blue corpse on the ground.”

Aaron follows Scott's gaze to the package. “I don’t remember ordering anything,” he says, picking up the box as he starts to open it.

He wrestles with the paper inside: “Why do they shove so much crap into these tiny boxes! It almost feels like the paper is what I ordered!”

As he finally removes the last of the paper, he pauses, his brow furrows, he turns the box around to read the label.

“Oh, no wonder,” he says as he turns the box to show Scott. “It’s for you. The new mailman must have gotten our offices mixed up.” He hands the box to Scott.

Scott looks in the box and sees a silver dollar. The fluorescent lights above make the coin glisten.

“Oh…my…God,” Scott says, awestruck, staring at the silver dollar. “If I needed another sign that I was chosen, it’s this!” He holds it in his palm, like some holy object was given to him from the gods themselves.

“This is a 1903 Morgan Silver Dollar!” He exclaims.

“You say it like I should know what it is,” Aaron says, bored as he sits back down at his desk and closes the badger tab. “Stupid badger…” he says under his breath.

“This is the same year my great-great-grandfather…Ah screw it, it’s fate!” he says giddily as he begins to leave the office. “Anyway, thanks for almost watching me die again, let’s not make it a habit.” As he walks out of the room.

Meanwhile, across town, in the same run-down apartment, the man is still sitting in his recliner. This time, he has a bowl of what looks to be grapes, but on closer inspection,  they are blinking and pulsing gently. He begins to pop one by one into his mouth. On the TV, you see Scott back in his office, gingerly placing his new treasure in a small container. The man smiles, a glint in his eye. He sticks the blinking eyes on his fingertips and flexes them like tiny puppets.  


He looks down at them and laughs, a low, guttural sound. The eyeballs blink in response. In the background, a flicker crosses the TV. The picture begins to turn grainy.

“It’s about damn time you finally noticed,” the man says with a chuckle, as he pops the eyes off his fingers and eats them.

Chewing with a wet squish after each bite.

1lakqnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1lakqnj/if_you_try_you_fail/,"If you try, you fail","When you “try” to manifest your desire you fail instantly because you’re telling the universe that you don’t have what you want. The law of assumption and the law of attraction functions so simply but people tend to over complicate the entire process. Law of attraction and law of assumption are the same thing but told in different ways. The law of assumption says “live in the end” and the law of attraction says “feel as if you have your desire now”. In essence, it’s really the same thing, law of attraction explains it more simply but people like law of assumption because it’s extra simple. But why do people still struggle to manifest?

You get what you want, when you get what you want. You HAVE to live in the end in order to get what you want. That’s why when people give up on their desire, they manifest it instantly because that’s their end. Their end isn’t doing affirmations, believing in the 3D/4D garbage, scripting, silly methods… they just simply know and live in the end. There is no alternate reality where you have what you want. You either believe you have it here or you don’t. You don’t live your life saying “okay I have my car, cellphone, bed, the sun, water, grass, roads, my friends, my body in the 4D so I have to have it in the 3D”. See how silly that sounds? The 3D/4D nonsense pushes back your manifestation further than you think. You don’t wake up and have to manifest the device you’re holding now, you just know you have it. And it will work that way with absolutely anything you want to desire. Whether it’s a million dollars or a cup of coffee or a specific person - you have to know you have it. 

You have to let go. You have to let go of the wanting and start just knowing, you have to just feel it without trying so hard. If you’re trying to manifest an SP, stalking their accounts, making fake social media accounts to talk to them, doing affirmations like a crazy person, scripting isn’t going to manifest them. If these techniques make you feel good, sure go for it. But if you’ve ever been in a relationship, I bet you weren’t doing any affirmations everyday or stalking them - you just knew you were with them. When the universe sees you “try” it mirrors that back to you and gives you more of that. “I want to manifest my SP”. Okay you’ll keep getting more of wanting to manifest your SP. And then you get more and more obsessed with your SP, and you can’t figure out why. Rather you’ve been manifesting yourself becoming more obsessed with them. This is proof that manifestation is always working. This works in our favour because the doors of manifestation are always open, you can always make the switch of deciding that you have your desire now. Stop trying and start living in the end.

1lakq5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1lakq5x/165k_total_budget_breakdown_i_came_in_under_10k/,$16.5K TOTAL budget breakdown (I came in under $10K personally!),"Hi all!

I really found this community to be super helpful in my planning process. I loved both the actual advice, facts, and experiences shared but also just knowing, wow, I'm not alone in the way I wanted to plan my wedding. So, I want to hopefully pay it forward and share our wedding experience. Here is our budget breakdown with detailed notes and with LOTS of caveats that we could never have done this alone and that we could have definitely spent a lot less in certain areas. It is all a balance! I am going to try to highlight the places where we could have chosen a cheaper option. We also purposefully planned our event WAY in advance, like over a year, so that we could slowly pay for things with time as we saved - if we had planned this over 4-6 months we would never have been able to afford it all.

We opted to skip the ceremony as it just wasn't as important to us as the PARTY! We had a family friend notarize our papers and did private vows together at home. We asked a friend of ours who owns a local coffee shop/restaurant if we could host the reception there and he said yes. In my mind, this saved us SO many ""nickel and dime"" upcharges we would have had had we done a backyard wedding (renting tables, bathrooms, tents, etc.) or at a traditional venue (paying a fee per chair, plate, napkin, wine glass, etc.) as the restaurant just let us take over all of their seats and tables etc. and already had a huge covered patio and a bar area.

We asked for help everywhere that we possibly could. We are INSANELY grateful to all the help we received! I did plan basically the entire thing by myself but had so much help in completing the vision and the details as well as paying for portions of the day.

**Photography: $3073**  
We did opt for a traditional wedding photographer, but we reached out and asked for a custom payment plan since we were halfway between an elopement and a full day of wedding coverage. Because we didn't want/need our photographer for daytime/getting ready photos or for a ceremony, we hired her for the 4 hours of the reception as well as one additional hour prior to the reception to take posed photos of our families. This also included a full engagement session as well that yielded us about 200 great photos. We did receive some Christmas money from my husband’s father as well as a work bonus from my job which we used to pay for most of this as it was one of the biggest expenses. 

**Wedding Dress: $783.51 - dress + $455.49 - alterations**  
I got my dress at David’s Bridal thinking it would be cheaper than some of the popular boutiques around the city I live in. It definitely was cheaper up front - full price was $599 plus we added a belt and tax got us to the $783.51 number. I opted to do the alterations there in house because I figure David’s Bridal only sells so many dresses and they know these well. The person who helped me with alterations was amazingly nice and welcoming, and made this process better. It may sound unusual but the dress was something I simultaneously really wanted and also was dreading as it brought up a lot of money stress and body image issues. I did have really good customer service from them overall and would definitely recommend signing up for their emails about their sales because I think I could have taken better advantage of a 20% off day to save a good bit of money. I think there’s a chance I could have gotten cheaper alterations elsewhere but I think it still would have easily been $250-$350 at best.

**Suit + Alterations: $883.49**  
My husband also splurged a bit on his suit - we decided we wanted to buy, not rent, so he could wear it again. We had a good friend who is a regular customer at a nice local menswear store and highly recommended the employee here for service and tailoring. He was INCREDIBLE and so nice and helpful, but it came at a cost. This is somewhere I am positive we could have saved money by going elsewhere - I think the cheapest other suit option we found would have been around $300-350.

**Shoes for bride and groom: approximately $200**  
I was adamant about not buying expensive white heels I couldn’t walk in and would never wear again (I generally never wear white). Because we were only doing the reception, I wanted comfort with a side of cute. I opted to buy white leather platform Converse sneakers that were about $80-$90 with a sale code. I bought my husband some custom blue Vans that ended up being a little over $100. We could have gotten non-custom vans for closer to $50-60 and we could have gotten non-leather Converse for me for probably $20 less as well. We have both already worn these shoes again and again.

**Venue: free + $600 to tip baristas who helped**  
Our venue was supposed to be $1800 but my sweet sweet friend who owns the space let us use it for free as a wedding gift because he is so kind and generous. We agreed to pay three of their staff members $200 each to help with set up and break down for before and after the reception and also told them they could hang out and eat during the party if they wanted. They did an incredible job and I can’t thank them enough for making the space look amazing. 

**Flowers: $270.94**  
Okay this one I am proud of and it’s all thanks to this subreddit! I ordered two of the “Mountain Bouquet” arrangements from the Bulk Flowers section of the Costco website. The final total was $219.48. I ordered in April for a future delivery of Friday, June 6 - they arrived before 12 noon that day. Our party was on the following Sunday June 8, so the evening of June 6 I had a bunch of my friends come help me make the arrangements and we stored them in our family’s store’s walk in cooler (more on this later). I also ran to Trader Joes that morning and bought some eucalyptus, baby’s breath, and some large yellow chrysanthemums and the total was $51.46. I cannot BELIEVE how cheap this is compared to traditional florists!!! If we had even said the wedding word to any of them it would have been thousands of dollars! I highly recommend using Costco or Trader Joes for your flowers if you don’t mind. I really had fun with it and the flowers came out beautifully. I have heard Sam’s Club is also great for flowers. 

**Catering: $7361.75**  
Okay here is a splurge but we also knew the food and wine were most important to us. We got a lot of finger food to run for the entire night for 120 guests. We also received a 10% discount for friends and family since the Caterers we use are friends of my family, which saved us several hundreds of dollars. They made us a “To Go” food theme complete with mini slider cheeseburgers, mini hot dogs, mini tacos, mini soba noodles and “general tsos cauliflower” in to go boxes, and more. It was AMAZING!! However, this is again a place you could totally save more money. I know a lot of people do BBQ for food or other types of more affordable buffets, and it is WAY cheaper. This was a highlight for me and one of the things I really wanted. This is definitely the largest expense and my mom was adamant about paying for it (I tried to stop her or contribute but she insisted). **Cake: $477.88**I had a family friend ask if she could pay for our cake for us. We did not want to spend a lot on a big cake so we ordered a bunch of cupcakes and some rice crispy treats from a local bakery and then got one 6 inch cake for just us. Again, we didn’t have to personally pay and we are so so grateful. I think a Costco sheetcake is what we would have done if I hadn’t had this family friend step in, which definitely would have been a bit cheaper but just as delicious and beautiful!

**Wine / Beer / Drinks: Approximately $1500**  
I don’t have the perfect numbers on this, but, my family owns a wine shop where my husband works so, we get wine at cost instead of at markup. (This is also where us having a walk in cooler we could use came in REAL handy! We were able to pre chill all the wine and beer and drinks). This was something that was very important to us to be “GREAT” and all of our guests told us over and over “I know the wine is gonna be good at this wedding!” So, we had some nice champagne as well as some cheaper spanish sparkling wine, and some red and white wine that would typically retail for an average of about $20. Now we could have OF COURSE saved money here but we really wanted to have good quality wine - it was really important to us. We also had a friend who works at a local brewery buy the beer for us with her discount and it was very cheap, about $20 per case (normally would retail for $12 a 6pack). We also bought some Miller Lite and some random drinks (LaCroix, Coca Cola, etc.) at Costco. My best estimate for the craft beer my friend got us was about $120 and then maybe $150-$200 more for the other Non Alch drinks we got. I watched for sales on the LaCroix and Coca Cola, another benefit of planning way in advance - it allowed me to be proactive instead of impulsive.

**Music: free**  
One of my best friends is in a band, has tons of music gear, and regularly hosts his own karaoke nights….so…. I asked if I could just make a playlist and he could help me with MC-ing a bit and with bringing speakers and a mic. He did and it was AMAZING!! I am so so grateful for this as it saved us soooo much money and was way more fun to me than having some random dude playing the Cupid Shuffle against my will! I got SO MANY COMPLIMENTS on the wedding playlist and it was truly my biggest honor that my guests enjoyed it. I was able to really tailor it to all of our different friend and family groups and it was SO FUN to make. I am glad I did the playlist myself as it was something I really stressed about and put off, but ultimately found a lot of joy in during the process. After I made it, I would listen to it on long car rides or while cleaning to see how “fun” it was to listen to, and if I ever had the urge to skip, and that’s how I whittled it down to being perfect, haha. 

**Invitations: $217.31 (no save the dates)**  
We ordered invites that my sister in law helped me make (she is a graphic designer, but did them for free, because again we have the BEST people in our life! If not for her, we would have used a template on Zola, Zazzle, or Canva probably). She recommended Zazzle and we ordered them there for quite an affordable amount. Zazzle has a lot of sales and discounts, I really liked their site. We added a QR code to the back of the invite and I made a free website on Zola all on my own for our guests to find more information. I guess I should add in the cost of stamps as well which was probably about $50-100. We decided not to do Save the Dates because I didn’t want to pay twice for this cost. I think this confused people slightly but we just made sure everyone invited was aware of this change.

**Bistro Tables: $500**  
Because I didn’t have to pay for the venue, and because it became apparent that we needed less sitting and more standing room than the restaurant originally provided for, we opted to buy some bistro tables on Amazon. The venue just had regular tables for sitting and we needed another option. I found some for an incredibly cheap deal, about $500 for 8 total. I also was okay with spending this money because I knew that my family’s business would be able to use the bistro tables again so it was an okay investment for me. I investigated buying the giant wooden spools on facebook marketplace and converting them into tables, and also investigated renting tables, and this was WAY cheaper and easier. Our family’s shop also has a utility moving van which also helped us a lot in being able to transport these tables back and forth. We have already used the bistro tables at our business multiple times before and since so they were definitely a worthwhile investment for me. I also bought them a bit closer to the wedding; if I had known at the very beginning that we would need them, I probably would have watched facebook marketplace/Buy Nothing/thrift stores/garage sales for them. 

**Decorations: free**  
Y’all aren’t going to believe me, but I was able to get TONS of free decor from a few girlfriends who had been recently married and from facebook buy nothing groups. I HIGHLY recommend using the Buy Nothing groups - people are happy to get rid of a lot of that stuff. I can’t believe how lucky we are but we were offered so many vases, tea light holders, table runners - more than we knew what to do with. We were going for the mismatched, bohemian look so everything worked perfectly in the coffeeshop setting. We really enjoyed the warmth it brought in and we had kind of picked that space to begin with because it had so much natural character in warmth and that we wouldn’t have to do much more with the space/everything would look pretty good there. I am so grateful to all the sweet girls who shared their extras with me. We got gifted a card box, vases, table runners, “reserved” signs, an easel, electric candles, votive holders, and more. We did end up buying our own guest book as well as a few more of the battery operated candles (way less stress than a real flame) as well as a few fairy light strands and fake greenery to create a photo booth area - so maybe “free” isn’t exactly accurate, but I really only spend about $100 or so. It all came out great. I will be passing along all of the things I used to the next person I know who is getting married. 

**Party Favors: $250**  
The wine theme is strong in our family - we ordered custom corkscrews with our names on them as our favors and people loved them. My husband’s mom also lives overseas, so she brought us some beautiful Christmas ornaments and baubles from where she lives to give out. I am not exactly sure how much those were, but she gifted them to us. We had considered doing chocolates as well which would have also been about $200-$300. 

Let me know what questions you have!!! Sorry I didn't add photos. I know the total budget came in over $10K but I think because of a lot of the help we had, if you take out the food and wine that my parents helped with, we did spend less than $10K personally. I hope this helps remind you all how much your community WANTS to help you and that things are doable in a budget, with the also unfortunately true caveat that some s\*\*\* is just reeeally expensive. I know I am VERY BLESSED with supportive friends and family and that that may not be a reality for everyone else out there. There were definitely lots of moments where I stopped and said, wow, we should have never planned a wedding - because the money wasn't there and the opinions from everyone around me were getting to me. And if we hadn't had a real ""wedding reception"", it would have been okay too!!!

* Someone who is willing to talk about \*anything\* such as:
   * Life goals/plans, happy times in their lives, upcoming vacations, what they've been up to lately, people who enjoy talking about pets/animals, music, books
   * Depression, therapy, an occasional whiner/complainer
* Someone with legible handwriting! I am so sorry but I don't enjoy trying to decipher what someone wrote. :(
* Do you enjoy including postcards, tea, ephemera, stickers, washi, etc in your happy mail letter? Me too! Doesn't have to be all the time or all of the above in every single letter, but it is a nice surprise/gift. :)

  
Some of my personal interests include traveling, the outdoors (hiking, the beach, picnics), postcarding, dogs, reading, crime podcasts, getting back into crocheting, and cooking.

After the interrupted update, I could only ever download the update but never actually install it via the Swarm II app (on Android) or my PC. After a while a message would pop up saying ""Error - something went wrong"" and tell me to unplug the transmitters, etc (see photo).

Then after a while, I couldn't connect the headset to my Swarm II app at all, even though it was connected to my phone via Bluetooth (see photo). 

After another day or so, I couldn't connect to anything and the headset would turn on for about 3 seconds then flash red and turn off .

My Fix: Hard Reset (I know, slightly obvious, but I'd tried it before and for some reason could never actually execute the reset)

To hard reset (at least on the 700 gen 3), you need to hold the Mode and Crossplay buttons for 10 seconds.

It was a little tricky given my headset would turn on for only ~3 seconds, then flash red and turn off. So I kept playing around by holding the Power button, then when it turned on, held the Mode and Crossplay buttons as well (while still holding the Power button). Eventually, the Power button turned a faint red and the hard reset was complete.

Was able to install the newest update and all is good 

TLDR - interrupted firmware update caused a boatload of issues. Only fix was hard reset and finishing the update. ",3,1749832747.0,TurtleBeach,1,1.0,False

Normally they are mostly an annoyance, but this year their numbers have exploded to a worrying amount. On a rainy day we can find 100 in a single room.

They are 1 to 5 mm in size. The attached picture is made using a strong macro zoom, so it might be a bit misleading for scale. For scale reference, the surface the bug is on is tissue paper.

We encounter them mainly near windows and areas with cracks in brickwork, leading us to believe they come from outside and dont actually thrive or multiply much inside the house. We find them both on the ground floor and 2nd floor on both sides of our house. Part of our roof is tatched (with water reed), and they seem to be more numerous the closer we are to the tatched part of the roof.

We havent identified obvious patterns in behavior, other then that they seem to tend to climb upwards along walls and we often find them dead in water (like the coffee machine, water boiler, cups in the sink etc.). It does not seem to be attracted to food or things like sugar. If it is a larvea of some kind, we have not found obvious signs of the later stages of the bug.

My best guess is that these are a species that lives and thrives in the water reed on our roof, and the ones we find in the house are strays. It would explain why rain specifically seems to drive so many inside (since rain would also wash them down).

Me 25m I live with my parents after falling 3 stories out of an apartment building, this as you can tell was not apart of my life plan, when I moved back in I was in a wheelchair from my shattered heal and other injuries, My parents they were all supportive of me and wanted to me to get through the physical rehab and start working again; when I was partially cleared from physical rehab I started working a part time job at a coffee shop working 25 hours a week after doing that for a while and getting back into the work flow, my father (who was put into disability due to cancer) started getting angry because I wasn’t working 40+ hours a week, so I got a different job after I cleared from rehab now I’m working 45+ hours a week and making some money, the problem starts when I started working at the part time job my dad started to charge me rent (which I have no problem paying) but he back charged it with other bills that I was unable to pay due to not working and the injuries and said if I didn’t pay them by 4 months later then there will be issues, well now it’s 4 months later I have 800 dollars left to pay and since I didn’t pay all of by the first of this month he is now kicking me out and calling me useless and constant telling me how I have nothing to show for my life when he is the one who is taking ever cent of money that I earn. I have nothing in my savings account since I needed to pay bills and other things while being injured.so am I in the wrong for being upset in him for actively trying to shove me down by calling me useless and taking everything that I earn and in turn telling me I have nothing to show for my life.

crisp, butter-crusted and plain.
Coffee swirling, cinnamon and cream.
Sunlight spills softly; morning toes
peek out from cotton covers, the tips of pink nails catching gold in the beams.

Now, my coffee is far too black—
a magnetic void, a bitter whirlpool.
Its acidity seeps from my esophagus
to my heart, pumped into my bloodstream,
melting my thoughts
back to days of yellow butter
and oatmeal raisin cookies.

I walk into dawn
as my hangnails bleed.

I'm a coffee roaster here in Arusha, Tanzania. We're roasting some seriously premium, good quality Kilimanjaro coffee beans, and our market is mostly local, with a steady flow of tourists to take a taste of Tanzania home with them.
Recently, I had an American visitor who was so impressed with our roasted beans that they're now looking to buy from us and sell in the US. This is a first for us in terms of international shipping for resale, and it's got me thinking about the wider market.
So, for all you coffee connoisseurs and entrepreneurs out there, I'm curious:
 
-What are you typically paying for nice, whole roasted beans per kilogram in the US? And how about for grounded beans?
 
-What's the general availability like for high-quality Arabica beans in the US market?
 
-And just out of curiosity, what's the cheapest you've seen Arabica beans go for, wholesale, in the US?
We're passionate about our Kilimanjaro coffee and excited about the possibility of reaching more coffee lovers globally. Any insights you can share would be incredibly valuable!

I'm listening to a coworker complain about celebrating her husband's birthday. His coworkers had celebrated his birthday with two different cakes and a coffee mug that says ""I'm too pretty to work"". She growled that he wasn't even good looking. 

It made me think about how far she'd take my birthdays. One year, she made me my favorite cake, red velvet, from scratch. She used her granny's recipe. Another year, she bought me t-shirts and showed them to her work team. They'd all give me knowing smiles.

Highland is for students to meet + study, get a cup of coffee, stay

1lak4my,https://i.redd.it/a79h26zrzp6f1.jpeg,Our pitiful boy!,"So,Wends was crazy day. Freak accident resulted to this!!
I woke up grabbed my coffee walked into the dogs room (the 2 boys have a bedroom for nighttime) to let them go outside & what do I see first!?
BLOOD everywhere literally. Hardwood floors red, the walls red,ceiling has blood splatter,their beds soaked.
I freaked as you could imagine! This guy named Cash stands up & is mostly red himself. 
My 1st thought was OMG they got in a fight!? Which has never happened. 
I called my boyfriend said to get home because he needs to be driven to the vet (my mobility is bad so I can drive) ASAP.
When I got a good look at Cash I noticed the blood was a very slow steady stream coming from the tip of his ear. It was so odd because there was just a 1/4th inch rip? I tried to clean it up good & calm him down until my boyfriend got home. 
Which keeping this Dane calm is nonexistent.
We wrapped his ear tight to his head to keep it contained & from getting blood all over Jeep. 
Took my boyfriend 45mins to get to the vet. He called me & said they took him back right away because they had to put him under anesthesia and put stitches in it. The vet called 2hrs later saying this was worse then we all thought. said Cash somehow managed to get a clean cut from the middle of his ear straight down and he got an artery!!!!
He would have died by the end of the day😭.
We still have NO CLUE how this happened. Only possible explanation is one of his nails got it because he does like to itch his own ears.His favorite thing in the world is his ears rubbed. His nails are short so idk.
He’s got so many stitches.Has to stay wrapped up like that until Tuesday then goes back to unwrap it. The cone stays on for 2wks. 
We have to keep him in a crate for a few weeks & only out for bathroom. 
He’s a very very active boy so it’s for his safety. 
This is so sad!! I’m thankful he’s ok.

My name is Bruno, and I'm the vocalist for **To Bloom**, a local band mixing prog rock and post-hardcore with some Latin grooves and weird time signatures. We just dropped a new single called **“Daughters""** and we figured we'd share it with the local community!

We recently went full DIY - recorded and produced everything ourselves on my MacBook in a tiny, definitely-not-soundproof room with roommates who probably heard more than they signed up for. No fancy studios here, just good vibes and lots of coffee. We only outsourced mixing and mastering because, well…ears are hard.

If you like local music or bands like The Mars Volta, DGD, and Opeth, give it a spin! Would love to connect with other Portland music peeps and find other folks that play/enjoy this kind of music!

Thanks for the love and support!
