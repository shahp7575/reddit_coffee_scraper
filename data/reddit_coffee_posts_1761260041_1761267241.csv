1oek9ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1oek9ar/drivethru_safari_prices_in_orlando/,Drive-thru safari prices in Orlando?,"Just got back from an amazing experience at Wild Florida Drive-Thru Safari Park, and I need to share all the details about this hidden gem just outside Orlando. If you're looking for pricing info and whether it's worth it - I'll break it all down.

The base admission is $35 per person, with discounted rates for kids. Here's what surprised me - this isn't just a quick drive-by zoo. You get access to both the drive-thru safari AND their Gator Park, where you can see over 150 different animals.

I spent about 3 hours there total, but you can go at your own pace. The drive-thru portion took me about an hour since I stopped a lot to take photos. Pro tip: early morning visits mean more active animals and fewer cars.

What really made it worth every penny was getting to see animals like zebras, bison, and white-tailed deer just chilling in their natural environment. No cramped cages or artificial exhibits - these animals have tons of space to roam.

Here's the game-changer - for an extra $5, you can feed the giraffes from an elevated platform. DO IT. Seriously, it was the highlight of my trip. Where else can you get face-to-face with a giraffe for the price of a coffee?

I booked my tickets through [this link](https://athomewave.com/Orlando) and saved some time by skipping the ticket line. They've got this ""book now, pay later"" option which is pretty convenient if you're still planning your trip.

Some practical stuff you should know:
- Open Monday through Saturday, 9 AM to 5 PM
- You can cancel up to 24 hours before for a full refund
- It's wheelchair and stroller accessible
- No pets allowed (service animals are OK)
- Located at 3301 Lake Cypress Rd, Kenansville

Quick heads up - this place gets busy, especially during peak tourist season. Most people book about 11 days ahead, so plan accordingly. 

Compared to other Orlando attractions, this is honestly one of the better values I've found. You're not rushed through on a guided tour, you can revisit animals as many times as you want, and the whole experience feels more authentic than your typical tourist attraction.

If you're on the fence about visiting, just book it. With over 800 reviews averaging 4.7 stars, it's pretty much guaranteed to be a highlight of your Orlando trip. You can reserve your spot through [this link](https://athomewave.com/Orlando) - they've got a lowest price guarantee, so you know you're getting the best deal.

The best part? No dealing with crowded tour buses or following someone else's schedule. You're in control of your safari experience, which makes it perfect for families with kids or anyone who likes to take their time photographing wildlife.",1,1761267093.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

I made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Training/comments/1n7r4dr/do_you_supervise_as_a_training_specialist/

And discovered that I may (or may not) have a strange format for my training role, and possibly duped.

I am the only training position in my department and it’s a new role, meaning that they have no clue what exactly they want. My boss is open to discussing how I’d like to restructure the role, but I don’t know any other training specialists or people in similar positions and how their positions are structured. I’m still new in the official field.

I’d like to move away from supervising (it’s taking a lot of time out of my day to people manage rather than train.) I looked at my original job description, and I’m barely doing half of it! Some of it is so vague. 

Would anyone be willing to share how their day to day duties and job is structured? 

Also, if anyone is willing to chat further (I don’t feel 100% comfortable giving super detailed explanation of my job on the public post) I would appreciate chatting with you! If I can buy you coffee or something, I will!!",1,1761266802.0,Training,0,1.0,False
1oek5be,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1oek5be/lighthearted_day_in_the_life_of_an_infj/,"Lighthearted: ""Day In The Life"" of an INFJ","The INFJs around here know how often we get the ""where to find INFJs in the wild"" question. Personally, it makes me uncomfortabl because (1) it assumes INFJs are welcome to being cold-approached by strangers as they go about their lives in their safe spaces and routines, (2) it disregards the fact that we as individuals are very diverse, and (3) I worry that kind of content fetishizes INFJs or personalities that coincide with the type.

So. In an effort to clear up some misconceptions and reveal how normal our every day lives are, I wanted to share what I did on my day off, and where I might've been found in my free time.

Morning: I propogated my larger houseplants while chugging iced coffee. Showered and attended my doctor's appointment (reason for day off) and did some grocery shopping on the way home.

Mid-day: Went to the library. Returned CDs I rented previously (NIN, Kelly Clarkson, Breaking Benjamin) and one of my favorite books (The Colorado Kid). Spent some time looking for a cookbook for frugal and basic meals. Also wanted a book on houseplants, as I want to add more to my collection. Found The Benchwarmers movie too, made me very nostalgic and happy. Sat down with my materials to decide if I could just take pics of a few pages, or if I wanted to check them out. Once finished, I spent some time on my laptop looking for a good, cheap, kid-friendly DIY Halloween decoration, as I live in a complex with lots of young kids and toddlers. Checked out my books and Benchwarmers, then headed to dollar store to pick up the DIY supplies. Stopped at home depot to pick up a new houseplants.

Afternoon: Situated new houseplant where it's gonna live, made a list of what I still need to do to/for it. Flipped through books again, bookmarked pages I wanted to refer back to/take notes from/scan into my laptop. Made myself late lunch/early dinner of taco bowl salad. Started a load of laundry, and sat down to start sketching out the parts I needed for that Halloween decoration while watching Benchwarmers movie.

I am currently taking a break from the DIY decoration project and planning to hit up a local 24hr dessert spot later, where I'll pick up something for myself tonight and something for my sister's family for this weekend. Otherwise, I'll be watching ESPN Loves Hockey Night while I continue the DIY decoration project.

Tomorrow: work out, stop for gas before work, clean house after work, errands/grocery shopping after that, then watching more hockey with pizza and beer, possibly finishing my DIY decoration.

I enjoy doing these things alone, but in places where there's lots of people to watch and quietly relate to. I don't mind chatting with folks, but I'm not looking for attention or for my time to be monopolized.

Hopefully this is what all those INFJ hunters are looking for, because this is literally the reality of my free time as an INFJ.",3,1761266764.0,infj,0,1.0,False

I recently picked up this Drexel Estorada coffee table for free today so figured it can’t hurt to try and refinish it. I’m newer to refinishing furniture but have done a few pieces before. I have a few questions below.

1. Does anyone know if this is a solid wood piece? To me it looks like it but, I could be wrong.

2. 2nd pic is after doing a coat of stripper and scraping off the finish. I haven’t started sanding yet. Should I go in with oxalic acid for this “water mark” I don’t know if it was actually water because it ate all the way through to the wood. 

3. What would you do for the legs with how detailed they are? I thought about leaving them as is but matching stain might be hard and I plan to use a satin poly and this piece was pretty glossy. 

4. Does anyone have any more info on this line from Drexel? I only saw 2 posts when I google lens’d it. Is this a rare piece?

Today I had a hair appointment at a spa. My mom gave me one of her appointments because I have long hair and I have never been to the nice spa she goes to. Upon checking in I was asked by the receptionist if I wanted drinks. They had water, coffee, and wine. In all honesty, I was very interested to see what kind of wine they had, but I asked for coffee.  
  
The receptionist had a very joyous energy. She was very full of life. Her energy was not just joyous, but infectious as well. After the appointment I had to tell her to let her know she was doing a great job.  
  
It is a shame that not many people are like that. I think I do my best to remain joyous and spread joy, but even I fall short. Most people are quite miserable here, especially in this time period. It is not that I blame people for being miserable, it is a very miserable time after all, it is just good to see some people not broken down by it.  
  
I hope the best for the receptionist that she may remain joyous all the time. I am very glad that I said something as well. Energies like that need to know they are doing something right. People may try to stamp out such a positive spirit and make them as miserable as they are, but the strong remain joyous.

After that day, we rarely talked about the houses on the North side of town. But it didn't mean it escaped us. We still wondered, it still was killing us to know. But as they say, time flies when you're having fun. The following year, they found a way for me to be able to go to their school dances, and even to their junior prom, where I met a few more people I gradually became friends with. We spent most evenings adventuring, especially once Isaiah got his license and a car when he turned 16. I got my license when I was 15, just had nothing to drive at that time.

Before I knew it, I had turned 17 years old, and was done with school. My teen years flew by me, and I began working at Pauline's for the morning shift, Monday-Friday. I was usually out by the time the other three got out of school, but as their high-school homework got harder and more intricate, they had less and less time during the week. Which most days I was thankful for, because I'd be exhausted after getting up at 5am for my shift.

I looked in the mirror after washing my face after work, I noticed how different I looked. My hair had grown longer than I had ever had it, and I finally got a real haircut at a real salon, deciding on a long ‘wolf cut’ style, figuring that'd be easy to style with my naturally voluminous brown hair. I noticed my facial structure was sharper, more structured and adult-like. I knew I wasn't an adult *yet*, but it was crazy to me how much more grown I looked to myself. 

I checked the time on my cellphone and saw it was 3:00, meaning my friends would be getting home around that time. I headed downstairs, grabbed a bottle of water, and sat at the island in the kitchen as I waited to hear from them. 

Shortly after, I had heard a car honk outside my house, I knew it was Isaiah's. I quickly hurried out of the house, locking the door behind me because my mom was at an appointment. 

I got up to the car, Isaiah in the driver's seat, Kirlyam, and Cameron, a friend of theirs who had become one of mine, in the back seat. Cameron was tall, nearing 6 ‘2, very lanky, and had dirty blond hair that could have been a light brown depending on who you asked. As my mom said, there wasn't a single thought behind his brown eyes most days, but he meant well. He had the typical skater kid aesthetic, wearing baggy jeans (that didn't sag), and some sort of beaten up t-shirt, usually accompanied with a beanie of sorts.  

 

“How does it feel to be almost eighteen?” I asked, speaking to Isaiah through the rolled down window. , he nodded and shrugged, “Where's Hunter?” I questioned, “He wanted to drop his stuff off first, so I said we'd pick you up then come back to get him.” He informed me. “Okay sweet, dibs on the front seat–” I said, opening the door quickly, I got in and buckled my seat belt.

We drove the few houses down and our curly haired friend, who had an immaculate beard at the age of 17 stood there, “Like he won't—” Isaiah went to say. “Out the front seat, ya freak–” Hunter said plainly, slipping his large rimmed tortoise patterned sunglasses onto his face. His tone of voice and expression being compared to only what I would imagine a typical school bully in a movie would sound like. “Nah.” I said, motioning to the open seat in the back, as Kirlyam slid to the middle seat. Hunter looked at me for a moment, knowing that I couldn't take his seriousness seriously. “She never falls for it, Hunter—” Isaiah said, leaning over the middle console to say to him. “Known him too long–” I added once Hunter got into the car. “Yeah, you're right, I gotta find some cooler people to hang out with.” Hunter  said seriously, but jokingly, buckling his seat belt. “Cooler? We're bout as cool as you're gonna get, honestly.” I laughed. He gave a serious look, then cracked a smirk when I looked back at him. “Tell her what your mom said, Isaiah–” He said, looking over at our friend in the driver seat.

I turned my head to Isaiah as we passed the town line, “Oh—she said we can all go up to my grandpa's cabin after graduation for a weekend—as long as we leave it in good shape.” Isaiah said. “Really? She says no every other year.” I said, sounding really surprised. “Yeah, no---she's legit, says it's part of our graduation present for the group.” He nodded, turning down the street that led to the highway. 

 One week had passed, they finished school, had their graduation that my parents and I attended, and the following week was Isaiah's 18th birthday. I had requested off from work to go with them, which thankfully my boss accepted. 

“A whole weekend up here is gonna be fun—we've only come up for a day before.” Kirlyam said as we headed on our way to Shelburne, Vermont. The furthest I had ever been without a parent with us. “So what do you guys wanna do when we get there? Swimming, a hike?” I asked. “Might be a bit cold, but maybe—” Isaiah said, I was thankful because I wasn't looking forward to the cold, still spring temperatured lake, “But mom handed me a cardboard box when I was leaving, apparently all the stuff she took from me that I wasn't supposed to have growing up, so I'm intrigued to know what it has in it–” He said, peaking my interest of what that could be. But surely she wouldn't give that manilla folder back, so I stayed quiet on that matter. 

Another hour or so and we finally arrived at the large cabin, secluded to a homey land with the edge of Lake Champlain. I always adored that cabin, we had been there a few times with Isaiah's parents for quick day trips, but being here with it just being the group was nice. “This place is huge.” Cameron said, peering out the window at the cabin. “Yeah my mom inherited it when my grampa passed away–but we share it with some family we are close with."" Isaiah explained, putting the car in park.

We settled our stuff in the bedrooms, the girls sharing a room, and the boys sharing one, before we settled down in the living room, on the floor sitting crisscrossed around the cardboard box Isaiah was dying to open. He grabbed a knife from the kitchen and sliced the tape sealing the box slowly.

He unfolded the tabs of the box and his eyes widened briefly, inside the box were a few lighters, a pocket knife, a few dirty magazines, “Hell yeah—I'll take those.” Hunter said, reaching for the two magazines. And finally, “No way.” He said, reaching to the bottom of the box. We all leaned up on our knees briefly, settling back down as he retrieved the all too familiar pale colored folder, letting it drop with a thud to the floor, “No freakin way–” He repeated, only way more excitement in his voice as he jumped from kneeling and sprung on his feet. When I spotted the folder I immediately grew weary, talking about our old obsession in front of Cameron. “I can't believe she left that in there, and didn't burn it or something—do you think she even realized it was in there still? Why would she give that back?” He asked happily. “Maybe she didn't realize–maybe it was blocked by the nudey mag.” Hunter suggested, he leaned back on his elbow laying on his side kind of, looking through the magazine, peering at it over the top of his sunglasses. Then he realized what Isaiah was looking at, “Holy shit—is that what I think it is?” He sat up quickly and dropped the magazine, joining the conversation with full attention. 

Cameron looked at us and the papers confused, “What is this all for?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. He didn't live in Sugar Hill, he lived in a town neighboring Franconia. So of course he wouldn't know what the hell we were on about. Kirlyam explained the story of house numbers 77 and 79, giving all the possible details we gathered through the years, which wasn't much, ""We've always been *dying* to know why they really are the way they are.” She added, intently reading one of the sheets. “But my mom took it from me when we were like 15—she must've forgotten these were in here, *no way* she'd wanna give them back.” Isaiah pitched in.

About a half hour later we were still intently going through and scanning all the documents, somehow it seemed that there were more than we remembered. Definitely more than what we remembered seeing. And the more we read, the more things didn't make sense. “Are you fucking with us?” Kirlyam asked, flipping through one of the stapled packets she had, “All of these definitely weren't in here years ago.” She added. “I swear—I had no idea.” Isaiah held his hands up, “Have you guys found anything interesting?” He asked.

We all shook our heads, then I turned to the second to last page in the packet I held. The bottom of the page, just under the signatures for the deed, was the name Atticus, Abacus Again, Atticus Abacus Again, written over and over again. In little, to big, to slanted, to perfect neat hand written. “What do you think this could mean?” I handed it to Isaiah, seeing as he was the most into researching legends and spirits and things, “Does the name Atticus Abacus Again mean something to you?” I asked softly, his eyebrow twitched up as he read the paper. He seemed to draw a blank thought. 

That was the first time I saw Isaiah genuinely get stumped over something like that. Over the course of the last couple years, he had studied far and wide into the spooky and supernatural urban legend world. But it was more worrisome he had no clue of where to go from that. 

We spent the next few hours trying to gain enough service on our cellphones to look up any sort of urban legend with the name Atticus Abacus Again, seeing as it ended up on each bottom of the last of the stapled pair of papers. But nothing came up, besides a few celebrities named Atticus, and the toy abacus itself. We kept repeating the name, maybe we were interpreting it wrong, maybe spelling it wrong. We weren't sure, but nothing useful seemed to be coming up. But I definitely thought it was too weird of a find for it not to mean something. The more we dug into the papers, the more small things we found out of place for those documents coming from the town hall. And things we were for sure weren't there the last time we looked at them three years ago. 

PART FOUR:

We all fell asleep around the living room, after a long night of trying to debunk what we could. I was on the big leather recliner, Kirlyam was on the other across the living room, Hunter on the floor with one of the fluffy mink blankets, and Isaiah and Cameron on either side of the ‘C’ shaped couch, their feet almost meeting in the middle. 

After a refreshing night's sleep, I woke up before everyone, around 8am, my normal sleep in time due to my work schedule. I got up and went to sit on the back porch looking over the water as I sipped my cup of coffee I made. 

Not long after, Kirlyam joined me, sliding the screen door open, she held her cup of hot coffee in hand. “Mornin Lya.” I greeted, yawning after. “Mornin–” She paused, yawning as well, “Did you leave the papers all over the floor like that?” She asked quietly after a moment. “What? Like what? Last I saw they were in the box.” I looked over at her, breaking my stare out onto the still lake. “They're like—all out of order on the floor–” She informed, motioning back into the house with her thumb as she stood up, gesturing for me to follow, I did. 

We quietly got into the living room, the sounds of the boys snores erupted in my ears, I wasn't sure of how I even slept the night before, if they were that loud. I glanced to the floor after chuckling at our friends that very much sounded like a pack of baby bears, and as Kirlyam said, the papers were all scattered about, not at all how we left them when we went to bed. 

“I wonder if Isaiah got back up, or something–” I tried to suggest, doubting my own words, knowing he fell asleep before the rest of us once we laid down. I shook my head, denying my own statement once my ginger haired friend gave me a quick ‘no’ look. “I know—I just, we'll have to ask them.” I shrugged, getting ready to step away then Hunter stirred in his sleep. His eyes bolted open and then he squinted up at us, “Why are you watching us sleep—” He stretched, pulling the blanket up to his shoulders, we shook our heads. “Ya freaks—” He muttered, his eyes slowly shutting again. 

We looked at each other then shrugged, wanting more than anything to wake those guys up, but we decided to be nice and go into the kitchen and make some breakfast. Maybe the smell of breakfast sausage,(Hunter doesn't like bacon), eggs, and toast would peak their interest. 

 

Not long after the pan began sizzling, Cameron, Isaiah, and eventually Hunter woke up, sitting up in a zombified state before they turned to look towards the kitchen. “Breakfast?” Isaiah asked, we nodded. He nodded in response then shifted his feet off the side of the couch, and gave a questioning motion to the papers on the floor, “What happened here?” He asked, we shrugged. “Didn't do it—woke up to em like that.” I said. “But we put them away—and in order.” He yawned. “Right—our confusion also.” Kirlyam said.

Once Cameron was alive enough to ask him, he also said he hadn't woken back up after we fell asleep. Which freaked us out even more. “Guys….” Isaiah said, picking up a piece of his breakfast sausage, he took a bite as he had picked up one of the papers. “What?” The rest of us walked from the kitchen area and joined him, holding out breakfast plates, sitting on the floor. “The saying—it’s–it’s gone.” He said, handing me one of the packets and the previous night plain as day had ‘*Atticus, Abacus-Again, Atticus, Abacus-Again*’ written all over the bottom half. “On all of them?” I set my plate down on the floor and began rifling through them. It had disappeared on all of them. “How is that possible?” Cameron asked, with a fright present on his face, “That can’t happen—” He shook his head, not believing. “No, I mean—that *shouldn’t* happen.” Hunter said, “But something spooky for sure happened here last night.” He added, taking a bite of his breakfast sausage link.

The energy around the house was a little eerie, to say the least, so after putting the papers away again, that time sealing the box back up, we decided to go hangout outside by the water to get our minds off of it. The water was so still, until a bird or a bug landed on the surface, creating a small repetitive ripple throughout the surface. I couldn’t get my mind off of the strange thing that happened. There was no way *we all* imagined that saying all over the papers. Even Cameron, who had nothing to do with our obsession or investigations prior to that, saw them, so there was no way we were all going crazy, *together*.

“I’ve got it!” Isaiah said, “Maybe.” He added, running up from the doc, where for some reason he got better service on his cellphone, he tripped once he got on the grass.. “What?” Hunter and I laughed, Kirlyam and Cameron made their way up from the waters edge. “Our town has the second copy of To Kill A Mockingbird at the library.” He said, reading something on his phone. “*Okay?*” Cameron and Kirlyam said together. “*And*—” He gave them a strange look, “Well one; when I searched up Atticus, the first thing that pops up for the name *Atticus* is Atticus Finch, so that made me look into that. *Then*, I found that our library has it—but it's the second copy Harper Lee made, so we can't rent it out. But to have such an important piece of literature, is a little strange for a town like ours. Don't you think?” He ranted, our other two friends becoming lost in the point. 

“So what was so special about *Atticus Flinch*? And what does he have to do with an abacus?” Cameron asked, air quotes around the name. “It’s Finch—and all I remember is he was a good guy. He was a lawyer who defended a man who was falsely accused of something—and he got backlash from the town because of it.” Isaiah shrugged, “I don't know—could be something else.” He said. “Good lead, just—I have no idea how that would play in here.” Hunter said, walking back up to the house, “Let's look at the papers again."" He waved his hand for us all to follow, we did. 

The weekend came to an end, we had no more leads. But everything about the cabin became spooky and felt different than before. So when we headed back Monday morning, it seemed to be a sigh of relief. “Thanks for the invite—” I said to Isaiah after I got out of his car he had backed into his driveway. “Duh–” Isaiah said, locking his car. I waved and made my way over to my house. My parents' car was in the driveway, and for it being only 2pm, that wasn’t normal. My dad for sure was always at work on Monday’s, and he hadn’t said anything about a vacation. 

I went to grab my keys to unlock the door, and the door creaked open slowly. “Mom, dad?” I questioned softly, no response emitted from behind the door. So I closed it back quickly and took my phone out and clicked on Isaiah’s contact, “*Hey–*” Isaiah answered, shuffling was heard in the background. “Hey, uh—could you come check out my house with me?” I asked, nervously turning around towards his house. “*Yeah, why what’s up?*” He asked, then I saw his front door open. “I’ll explain—” I said, hanging up the call. He jogged over and I looked up at him slightly afraid once he stood next to me, “My front door, I figured it’d be locked–but it just–opened.” I said. “By itself?” He asked, I nodded. 

Isaiah quickly wrapped his hand around the handle and turned it, pushing the door open with one swift motion. He hesitantly crept into the house, peeking around the door as he did, “Nobody is down here–downstairs at least—*hello? Mr. and Mrs. Dean? Are you here?*” He hollered through the house, the sound echoing off the eggshell painted walls. He headed up the steps, listening for any movement, nothing. I decided to go check in the kitchen, where I saw a laid out piece of printer paper, “*Isaiah!*” I called out, apparently not hearing his footsteps back downstairs. “I’m right here.” He said, walking in through the kitchen doorframe. 

 I picked up the piece of paper to read it: 

*H,* 

*Your grandmother isn’t doing so well, so we'll be gone for a little while. We are going to Connecticut to help grandpa out with things. Please be safe, we will be home as soon as we can. Make sure someone is there with you at all times, and don’t go to the North side of town just because we’re away, okay? It’s very dangerous, just, don’t. Don’t.* 

*We left the car, got a ride from a friend, so it’s there if you need it. We love you.* 

*Mom, and Dad.*

*P.S,*  

*Don’t stay out too late.*

“Okay so why was that chilling.” Isaiah asked. “Because it was, my parents *never* call me H—and he knows if I needed a ride, I could ask you–or I walk. So why would he leave his car—something doesn’t add up.” I set the paper down on the counter and turned around, “Something weird is happening.” I sighed, Isaiah patted my shoulder. “Isn’t it also weird that they left and kept the kitchen light on—midday?” He asked, looking up, he pointed up with his pointer fingers. I looked and saw that the main kitchen light was on, and again, it was Summer, at 2pm. 

Isaiah called Hunter and Kirlyam, explained what happened, so he and Kirylam decided to come and stay to make sure everything was alright. 

Everything really, was not alright. ",1,1761266499.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1oejvtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oejvtb/sf_welcome_to_wingspan/,[SF] Welcome to Wingspan,"Dr. Martin Tate banged his fist on the corrugated tin door. He finished the last of his water an hour ago, when he first spotted the structure. Spurred by the possibility of a settlement, he staggered desperately across four miles. Now, the hollow clang of the metal door filled him with dread.

Shielding his eyes from the midday sun, he noticed a rusty watchtower overhead. He glimpsed a guard in the tower and sighed with relief. Then he saw the rifle trained on him.

“Hands up and back away. Do you have any weapons?”

“I’m just a traveler,” Tate replied. He battled the dryness in his mouth. “I need shelter.”

The rifle relaxed. “Wait there.”

Tate waited, taking in the full view of the walled exterior for the first time. Tin sheets, a jeep door, armored plates welded together. A wall of junk. Moments later, he heard chains rattle as the main gate was forced open. A middle-aged man in a faded white shirt emerged, flanked by the guard.

“You’re alright, come on in,” he offered, waving Tate towards the entrance. Tate hobbled forward. “Dangerous business traveling out here alone. You walked?”

“My hoverbike broke down some miles back.” It was a lie, but Tate knew it would draw fewer questions than the truth. He examined his new compatriot: a stout man in his forties with a receding hairline, dabbing sweat with a crumpled bandana.

“The name’s Davis, though most people here call me Mayor Davis. These fine folks put me in charge three years ago.” A handshake extended.

“I’m Doctor--I go by Tate,” he said, accepting Davis’s hand.

“No sense in being modest, Doc. You could do us some good.” Davis paused, as he eyed the man before him. “So…where exactly were you coming from?”

Tate sheepishly glanced back at the desolate landscape over his shoulder and shrugged. “That’s fine,” Davis replied. “C’mon, I’ll give you the grand tour.”

The two men entered the open gate, Davis gesturing towards the colossal wreckage of a Navy Superhawk at the town’s center. “Welcome to Wingspan,” he exclaimed. Tate’s eyes traced the collapsed wings that ran the diameter of the settlement. He’d read about aircraft like this, but it was an entirely different thing to behold one in person. Wingtip to wingtip, they measured two football fields. 

Davis launched into a brief town history. The plane was shot down during the war, and the survivors built outward from its fuselage. An underground reservoir pierced by the crash kept the town alive, while wreckage scraps formed the walls.

Tate knew the War of 2125 left many Americans resentful of the government, both for the failed diplomatic efforts leading up to the conflict and for not protecting them from bombs. Assuming that a town like this would have no shortage of anti-government sentiment, Tate thought he’d better keep his former employer a secret.

Davis led Tate through the town’s center. “That’s Sal’s butcher shop. And next door is Enesta’s produce stand. She’s one-fifth Cheyenne. Her people lived on this land eons ago, before it all went to shit.” Davis caught Tate eyeing the vegetable baskets. “There’s only sweet potatoes and okra. It’s all this lousy soil can support. Trade caravans come once a month. We’ll be stocked up again come Thursday.”

From the butcher stand came a shout. “Hey, new guy! Come by if you’re looking for quality meat. I’ve got a few ribeyes and some ground beef,” Sal bellowed. Tate returned a wave, noting the bald butcher’s pink stained apron.

“Is there somewhere I can stay?” Tate asked.

“There’s Dina’s Diner up on the second tier.” Davis pointed to a sizeable mobile home that was somehow hoisted and built into the town’s second level. Twin Airstream trailers sat above the diner, attached by ladders. “Dina can fix you something to eat and give you a place to sleep. I’ll cover the credits for your room and board.”

Davis glanced up at the blazing sun, dabbing his head again. “Speaking of which, we have a bit of a code in this town. It’s firm. ‘He who does not work, shall not eat,’” Davis boomed. “John Smith at Jamestown. I fashion myself a bit of a historian,” he said with a grin. “Everyone has to do their part. That’s Wingspan policy.”

Tate nodded. “Seems fair.”

“You said you’re a doc, so maybe you could—“

“Not that kind of doctor,” Tate clarified. “I’m a botanist. I work with plants.”

Davis tucked his sweaty bandana into his shirt pocket. “I see. I imagine your doctor training comes with a bunch of general know-how.” Davis clapped Tate on the back. “Every person here has a role. We’ll figure out yours.”

Tate took the lift up to the second tier. Roughly eight-by-eight, the lift was a simple steel platform operated by an electric pulley system, which Tate guessed he’d destroy if he jumped up and down. Working in a secure lab for so long, he forgot how people on the outside might need to adapt. Eyeing the town as he ascended, he realized Wingspan was a testament to American resolve. Even with the country blown apart by nukes, Americans would rather build an elevator out of junk than take the stairs.

Tate wandered up to the diner mobile home. He opened the front door, comforted by the nostalgic jingle of a bell above. Six empty stools sat in front of a modest lunch counter. To his left, two booths with red vinyl seats. “Be out in a sec,” declared a voice behind the kitchen door.

A stocky, middle-aged woman popped through the swinging aluminum doors, drying her hands with a dishtowel. “There’s the new feller! I’m Dina. Mayor Davis radioed ahead and told me you’d be coming. You caught me in the middle of washing the lunchtime dishes. Otherwise, I woulda been out here to greet you proper.”

“It’s perfectly alright. I’m Tate.” Smiling, Dina waited expectantly as Tate looked around. “Seems pretty slow today.”

“It should be. This time of day, you’re the only one not working. Grab a seat. I’ll fix you something.”

Tate shuffled to a stool and plopped down. Two days. He’d been walking for two days. This was the first chance he’d had to sit on actual furniture. He couldn’t hide his satisfaction. For the first time since he left the lab, he loosened his grip on the canvas bag slung over his shoulder and let it fall to the floor. Inside was his career achievement — the device that made him a wanted man after fleeing Red River Biotech. To him, fleeing was not a choice but an obligation to humanity.

“So, tell me a story, stranger. Where ya coming from? What’s it like out there?” Dina inquired, giddy.

Tate pondered, wanting to talk, but decided it best to remain vague. At least until he knew these people better. “I’m from down near Lubbock. Like everywhere else, not much to see.” Besides a top-secret government lab, he thought.

“Lubbock? That’s quite a ways. It’s a miracle you made it here alone.” 

Distracted, Tate studied the cardboard menu with food and beverage options scribbled in marker. 

“This late in the month, that’s just for show,” Dina explained. “The only item available is the chicken pot pie ‘cause it’s frozen.”

“One pot pie, then,” Tate smirked.

\#

Tate wiped his mouth, picking at the bits of flaky crust lining the pie tin’s edge. Dina dropped a vitamin in her mouth, chasing it with a swig of water. “Iron pill. It helps to take ‘em until we get fresh produce.”

Tate gestured towards her water glass. “Your mayor said the town sits above an aquifer.”

“Yep. Great, big reservoir. It’s the only thing that makes this place habitable. Aside from here, the nearest water source is…I don’t know.” Dina took the empty tin pan. “You’re probably curious about the particulars ‘round here? There are fifty-three of us now,” Dina said. “Delroy Cook moved to New Tulsa to help with trade. That place survived because no nukes hit it — the Russians and Chinese ran out of long-range missiles. Folks there rebuilt faster than most.”

Tate sat silently. He’d never heard stories firsthand from any surface-dwellers before. He was tucked away in a state-of-the-art research compound while these people toiled away in a bombed-out hellscape.

“Where does the electricity—“

“Short version? We traded water for solar panels. Some smart folks even stabilized the old Superhawk core. After that, we finally got lights, freezers, the whole deal.” She nudged the freezer. “Not luxury, but it keeps us going.”

Tate raised his eyebrows. “Impressive.”

“Don’t be fooled. If the sun stops shining, we’re screwed.” She collected the empty pie pan. “Over by the solar array is also where our skimpy crops grow. Soil’s rotten, though. And I’ll tell ya what, living on just okra and sweet potatoes is not a fate I’d wish on any man.”

Hearing this, Tate perked up. “I might be able to help with that. In Lubbock, we improved crop growth with some new…techniques. The results were very exciting. Do you think I could see the crop field?”

“Knock yourself out. Mayor Davis would do cartwheels if we could grow somethin’ else.” She held up a finger. “But before you go…” Dina disappeared through the kitchen doors and returned a moment later, holding a wooden crate. “If you’re gonna work near the solar array, you should take one of these.” She opened the box and held a small, cast iron sphere in her hand. “It’s a dehydration grenade. On the north side of the wall, wild dogs have been known to attack people. Nasty critters. It’s also useful against the occasional bandit. You just pull the pin and throw. It lets off a big chemical cloud that sucks the moisture from organisms. It’s not entirely lethal. As long as anyone exposed gets a drink of water within an hour, they’ll be fine.”

Tate carefully placed it in his canvas bag. “This is great. So I can get access to the solar—”, he stepped off the stool mid-sentence and was instantly reminded of the strain his feet and legs endured from his trek. He stumbled but quickly caught the counter. Dina reached to steady him.

“Take it easy. Why don’t you rest and have a look at the field tomorrow? Those measly veggies aren’t going anywhere.” She pointed to a metal ladder on the far wall. “Go ahead and unwind in one of the Airstreams. They’re fully furnished. Mayor Davis has you covered for a few nights.” Tate nodded and started towards the ladder. As he was about to climb up, he turned back. 

“Hey, Dina. When was the last time you had a strawberry?”

Dina let out a laugh. “Don’t tease a girl.”

Tate slept in later than he expected, stirred by a growing chorus of voices. His watch read 07:15. He changed into his only extra clothes – faded jeans and a flannel button-up – and hurried down to ground level.

He strolled through the bustling town center, canvas bag over his shoulder. A maintenance worker and the tower guard chatted over a cup of coffee. Sal the butcher removed some cuts of meat from the shop freezer. Sal looked up, his face brightening. “Hey, pal. Good to see you again!” Spotting Tate’s bag, his tone shifted. “Say, are you sticking around?”

“Probably. I believe I have my work assignment. I’m going to check on the crop soil around the solar array. See if anything can be done.”

“Oh, good. I’m sure that’ll be good. If you’ve got some time, I’d love to bend your ear. I’m wondering if you’ve heard anything from farther out west. I’ll trade you a story for a steak. Whaddya say?”

“Sure.” Tate nodded, heading for the main gate—the only exit. As he moved north along the perimeter, he glanced up at the twenty-foot wall of scrap. Behind it, a whole community endured: people with names, jobs, and purpose. And this barricade of rubbish was all that stood between them and the endless nothing. Tate looked out at the horizon and that’s all he saw. So much nothing.

Tate rounded the north wall and neared the solar array. Dust coated the panels—who was maintaining them? He crouched, scanning the area. Dried weeds clung to the nearest ground mount, and farther off, trimmed sweet potato vines lay discarded.

Tate walked to the center of the array and stopped at a patch of cracked, lifeless soil. He punched the ground, and rubbed the dust between his fingers. Too much silt, and the perfect test site. He set down his device: sleek, black, brick-shaped. After a few taps on the touchscreen, it activated.

Four aluminum legs unfolded, lifting the device up. Tate held his breath. A glowing beam scanned a nine-inch grid, sweeping slowly across the dusty soil. The device hummed, beeped, then released a fine mist—moisture rich with nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter. The soil darkened. Then, a single seed dropped into the center. The legs retracted and the device tipped over, blinking red three times. Test complete.

Tate’s colleagues called it “fertilizer on steroids.” Gazing at the altered patch of soil, Tate held the device in his hands and smiled wider than he had in a long time. Then he heard the gunshot.

\#

It was around ten A.M. when the tower guard spotted two approaching hoverbikes. He alerted Mayor Davis, and together they formed the usual receiving posse: Davis, one guard over his shoulder, and another to operate the gate’s chains. Unusual to have unannounced visitors twice in as many days, Davis thought, but he dismissed it and passed through the open gate.

As the strangers came into view, Davis felt a burning in the pit of his stomach. These were not wayward travelers in need of help. These were government men. They wore the same monotonous black suit and black tie, now tinted dusty brown from their high-speed ride. Disembarking from their hoverbikes, they shook off the dirt and removed their helmets. Davis could now see them clearly: one was white, the other black, with a shaved head.

“Are you in charge here?” the white one asked.

“I’m Cameron Davis. I’m the mayor of this town. What’s your business here?”

“I’m Special Agent Allen. This is Special Agent Trotter,” he said, nodding to his counterpart. Shiny badges flashed. “We’re from the New Bureau of Investigation, Midland Division. We’re looking for someone.” Mayor Davis stared back, reactionless.

“We need to search your town,” Special Agent Trotter added. Lips tight, Davis turned and walked back through the open gate. The two agents looked at each other, then followed him in. As the three men moved towards the center of town, the hum of work slowed to a stop. Interlopers were here, and with them came trouble.

Mayor Davis’s aim was to avoid a confrontation. It was his responsibility to make sure things went smoothly and send these agents on their way. He stopped along the main path and gestured to the surroundings. “This is our town. Welcome.” Davis took the crumpled bandana from his shirt pocket and dabbed his forehead. The morning sun had just emerged above the exterior wall. “Now what was it you said you were looking for?”

“We’re looking for a suspect carrying stolen government property,” Agent Allen explained.

“What is it that they’re carrying?”

“It’s confidential,” Agent Trotter declared.

“Hell, everyone here’s carrying something. Myself, I’m carrying a well-deserved contempt towards government thugs.” *Damn*, Davis thought. *That was stupid. I got too cute, but they had that one coming*. Agent Trotter smirked slowly.

“We’re looking for a fugitive named Dr. Martin Tate,” Agent Allen offered. “There’s a good chance he may have stopped here. Have you seen any newcomers recently? Anyone suspicious?” Mayor Davis continued walking towards the market. The agents followed.

“Aside from you two, we haven’t seen any new faces here for days,” Mayor Davis said intentionally loudly. The two agents shared a glance. The three men were now close enough for Sal to hear. In her adjoining produce stand, Enesta sorted okra. Agent Trotter looked to Mayor Davis, then gestured to the food stands. “By all means,” Mayor Davis replied. 

Agent Trotter approached Sal’s butcher shop. “Excuse me, sir,” Agent Trotter started. “Seen any new faces around recently? Any questionable characters come through here? We’re looking for a fugitive.” He brandished a pocket notebook, ready to take down details.

Sal stayed tight-lipped. “I wish. New faces would mean new customers,” he said, averting his eyes and focusing on his burger patties. He turned his back to the agents and arranged the burgers in his fridge. In her produce stand to the right, Enesta erased the prices on her chalkboard for sweet potatoes and okra, then wrote in new prices, five dollars higher than before. She crossed her arms and glared at the agents. Slightly amused, Agent Trotter shook his head.

“I wish we could be more helpful,” said Mayor Davis.

“We wish the same. We’re going to have to canvass this settlement and speak with everyone,” Agent Allen declared. Mayor Davis opened his mouth to respond, but a shout from Sal’s butcher stand cut him off.

“I SAID I WAS NEVER GOING BACK!” Sal whirled around with a sawed-off shotgun in his hands and panic in his eyes. He pumped the forestock and took aim. In one fluid motion, Agent Trotter drew his service pistol from his hip holster, raised the weapon to eye level and fired. The bullet entered the right side of Sal’s neck. A splatter of red gore splashed against the butcher stand’s polyester canopy. Sal spun from the force of the shot, clutching the hole in his neck. He tried to steady himself with his left arm but quickly collapsed.

Mayor Davis staggered backwards, stunned, his bandana going to his open mouth. Agent Trotter’s eyes darted left and right for other threats, spotting his partner doing the same with his own gun drawn. “We’re clear!” Agent Trotter proclaimed.

Enesta was ducked behind her produce counter. She peeked her head out when the guns were finally stowed. Grabbing an apron, she hopped the partition that separated the two food stalls. “Oh, my God, Sal. Oh, my God.” She knelt down and cradled Sal’s head, pressing the apron against the carnage that was his neck. Enesta looked down at her friend; Sal’s eyes were glassy and he’d already stopped breathing.

Mayor Davis threw his bandana to the ground. “Lousy…bastards!” Agent Allen adjusted his suit jacket and regained his composure.

“He drew on my partner. You all saw it. The shooting was justified,” he said coldly. Agent Trotter marched towards the butcher stand, then hopped over the counter. He looked down at Enesta. Bloodstains flecked her denim shirt. Her face was tilted downward, with her forehead against Sal’s. Tears ran from her cheeks onto his. Agent Trotter reached for Sal’s shoulder.

“I need to I.D. him, ma’am.” At that, she stumbled backwards onto her rear. Her teary eyes hissed at him.

“You…,” Enesta muttered. Anguish and anger competed for control over her next words, but pain won out. She whimpered, burying her face in her hands, her back pressed against the butcher shop fridge. Agent Trotter knelt by Sal’s torso. He pressed a few buttons on the screen of his wristwatch. With two fingers, he pried Sal’s eyelids open wide, and positioned his watch over each eye for a retinal scan. 

“We’ve got a hit,” Agent Trotter reported to his partner. “Salvatore Russo. He escaped from North Fork Correctional two years ago. He was serving five years for tax evasion.”

“Tax evasion?!” Mayor Davis exploded. “There’s a disgusting irony. Taxes for what? This damn government has done nothing for us, besides letting us live out our days in this irradiated scrubland. And you chase a man down for taxes? No decency. None.”

“We can always have the Treasury accountants audit this town and everyone in it,” Agent Trotter mused. “That is, if you’re gonna give us a hard time.” Agent Allen placed an outstretched arm in front of his partner, chiding him for the provocation.

“We pay our pound of flesh,” Mayor Davis grumbled.

“Look,” Agent Allen began. “What happened here is unfortunate. It truly is. What we—""

“Murderer!” someone shouted from the mezzanine. Rising murmurs could be heard from the onlookers. Agent Trotter’s hand lingered towards his gun. Once again, Agent Allen made a motion to pacify his colleague.

“We still need to find our fugitive,” Agent Allen stated to the mayor. “And this instance proves something that we can’t ignore. That this town does, in fact, harbor criminals.” Mayor Davis scoffed. The distant murmurs grew louder. Some townsfolk stepped closer.

Agent Trotter raised his voice. “You’d be wise to keep your distance and stay calm. Or before sundown, there will be an army of agents just like us descending on your little tin can town.”

From a secluded portion of the upper scaffolding, Tate observed the exchange. Dina had ushered him in through a secret emergency door in the north wall after the gunshot rang out. The two of them spied the events from their hidden perch. Tate knew that if he hadn’t come here, Sal would still be alive. His intent was to save lives, not end them. Dina placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry,” she said. “I’ll help you hide.”

Back in the center of town, out of preservation for his townspeople, Mayor Davis acquiesced. “Go on and continue your precious investigation, but keep your hands off my people.”

At this, Agent Allen looked at ease. “Thanks,” he replied. “We should start with—""

“But there’s something you should understand first,” Mayor Davis interjected. His voice was calm but unyielding. “Nobody here eats or drinks without pulling their weight. That means you, too.”

The agents exchanged a look. “I’m a career investigator,” Agent Allen said.

Mayor Davis mumbled something under his breath and turned to Agent Trotter. “I was an electronics technician in the Army,” Agent Trotter admitted. “But without proper tools, I can only do so much.”

“We’ll keep it simple,” Davis instructed. “The panels by the north wall need cleaning. Rags and water will be waiting. Do the work, then you can start your questions.”

“Not exactly Bureau procedure,” Agent Trotter muttered.

“Welcome to Wingspan,” Davis replied.

\#

A few clean, tattered rags draped over Agent Trotter’s shoulder. Agent Allen hauled a bucket of soapy water, carelessly letting the contents splash out with each step. He observed the exterior of the town’s wall, sneering. “They built a whole wall out of scrap. Hell, the entire town is trash. Makes you appreciate the dorm at HQ.”

“Do you think any of these people will talk?” Agent Trotter asked. “They might be helping him hide right now. If he’s even here.”

Agent Allen pointed to the landscape. “Look around. There’s practically nothing for miles. There’s no way he made it past this settlement without stopping. Not on foot.” The two men paused once the solar array came into view. “Great. Now we can do our damn chores.” When they reached the nearest module, Agent Allen dropped the bucket with a thud. More water sloshed out. Agent Trotter studied a grimy panel surface.

“These have seen better days.”

“Not our problem,” replied Agent Allen, fishing a rag from the bucket. At each station, Agent Trotter took a moment to examine the components: the tempered glass, the solar cells, the junction box. By the time they reached the eighth module, his bewilderment was obvious.

“What is it?” Agent Allen asked, annoyed.

“Something isn’t right. A bunch of these have frayed wires. The two over there had broken glass. I’d bet that a lot of these don’t even work.”

“So what are you saying?”

“This can’t be their only power source.”

“So a handful of these panels couldn’t power the trash town?”

“We both saw a few freezers. There’s likely more. I also spotted this elevator-type thing.” Trotter’s eyes traced the electric cables running from the solar array, along the ground and up the town wall. “I’d say…the primary power source is in there.” He pointed to the broken tail of the Superhawk, where the cables entered.

“Well, will you look at that. Maybe these trash hoarders are a little more advanced than we—"", Agent Allen froze, his eyes catching something.

Twenty paces away, a small seedling rose from the barren soil, its leaves a vivid green against the dust. “He’s here,” Allen murmured. He neared the plant and crouched down. “Too vibrant to be theirs. And look — the soil’s darker, patterned. Just like the lab said.”

He pulled out his phone. “It’s Allen. No visual on Tate yet, but the device was likely used. Looks like a tomato plant. I’ll send images,” he concluded as he hung up the phone.

He pointed his phone at the tiny seedling, capturing and sending some images. “Okay,” he said, returning his phone to his pocket, “ball’s in their court.”

Agent Trotter’s eyes returned to the tail of the transport plane. “Back in the day, some of those Navy Superhawks would land at our base for cargo re-supply. They had a fusion core that would allow them to fly extra-long distances. It’s pretty interesting that these cables run up there,” he said with a raised eyebrow.

“Wanna check it out?”

“I do.”

\#

The interior of the Superhawk was quiet, as usual. A beam of light pierced the plane's midsection window, landing on the makeshift control terminal. Atop a pair of milk crates, the primitive terminal consisted of a tin sheet with one lever, two gauges and a few buttons. The nearby desk chair sat empty, normally manned by Benny, who was on lunch break. 

Benny climbed the ladder from his living quarters below, and took a quick look at the two gauges on the instrument panel. Satisfied with the readings, he settled into his chair and returned to his comic book.

From the rear of the fuselage, came a shout. “Anyone in here?” Agent Trotter yelled. Startled, Benny dropped his comic book and looked up.

“Y-yes, of course. Is that you, Felix?” Benny replied, as he observed not one but two figures enter from the rear cargo door. He watched as two strange men descended the makeshift slanted stairwell into the plane. When the two agents reached Benny, he noticed their suits, prompting him to stretch his tall, lanky frame and stand up straight. “H-how can I help you fellas?”

“We followed the wiring from the solar array and saw that it led through here,” Agent Trotter explained. “We thought we might take a look around.”

“Are you gentlemen new engineers in town?”

“We’re from the New Bur—,” Agent Allen began, but he was quickly cut off by his partner.

“We’re from the Energy Safety Commission,” Agent Trotter interjected, quickly presenting and retracting his badge. “We’re here to make sure that everything is functioning properly.” He pointed to the control terminal and the surrounding electrical wiring. “We need you to explain how all this works exactly.” Agent Trotter noticed Benny’s mouth slightly agape, and he was pleased that the man was sufficiently confused by this unexpected brush with authority.

“Why, yes, certainly. I can help. My name’s Benny.” He gestured to the control terminal. “And this workstation is my responsibility.”

“The solar panels outside, do they power the whole town?” Agent Trotter asked.

“Oh, no,” Benny replied. “They’re mainly for back-up energy for this instrument panel. You know, in case the core is acting up.”

“And the core?” Agent Allen prompted.

“That’s down in the belly of the plane. When that caravan with a few engineers came by years ago, they were able to fix the fusion core so we could use it. F-from then on, we’ve had lights and radios and freezers. It made life a heckuva lot easier. We call that the ‘Miracle Caravan.’ And all it took was a little water for a trade.”

“Ain’t that something,” Agent Trotter commented. “You’ve got your own nuclear fusion plant in this little patch of dirt.”

“And what do you do here?” Agent Allen asked, nodding to the terminal.

“You see, the situation isn’t perfect,” Benny noted. “When the engineers t-took a look at the core, they said the crash damaged the walls of the fusion chamber. So we can only create a fraction of the power that it used to make. At least safely, anyway.” Benny leaned over the instrument panel and pointed to the two gauges and the lever. “My j-job is to make sure the power and heat levels don’t get too high. When they do, I use that lever to power cycle the whole system,” he said matter-of-factly.

“Seems like you have quite the responsibility,” Agent Trotter remarked.

“You could say that,” Benny replied. “When Mayor Davis p-picked me for this, he said, ‘The regular tasks are for the many, while the important job goes to Benny,’” he recited, smiling at the memory. “That’s why I’m here all the time. Or, five days a week. Felix covers on the weekends.”

Agent Allen’s phone rang. He climbed one level of the stairwell to answer. “Understood. Yes, we can do that.”

“Stay here a moment while I confer with my partner,” Agent Trotter instructed Benny. “You’re doing great work here,” he reassured him, then climbed the single flight to join Agent Allen. Respecting the privacy of their conversation, Benny picked up the comic book that had fallen to the floor and started to page through it.

“So what’s the update?” Agent Trotter whispered to his counterpart.

Agent Allen matched his volume. “Boss confirmed – tomato plant. With the device deployed, mission integrity is compromised. We now have a green light.”

“A green light to..?”

“It’s no longer a recovery operation. We kill Tate and destroy the device,” Agent Allen stated. “You good with that?”

Agent Trotter paused for a moment in thought. He gazed at Benny and his comic book, then the control terminal. “Yeah, and I think we found an easy way to do both.”

Agent Allen grinned back at him. He then started back down the stairs. “Hey, Benny. I’d love to take a look at what you’re reading.”

Benny looked up from his comic book with a buoyant expression, just as the two agents grabbed his arms.

After Sal was killed, Dina whisked Tate away to the small cavern connected to the underground reservoir, where he remained. A service ladder led down there, and Tate rarely strayed away from it. There was only a small area of damp flowstone before the edge of the water crept up, so he sat on the narrow plot of wet rock. He used the downtime to form a plan. The town wasn’t big. He knew the agents would find him eventually. He didn’t want to risk further harm to these people. He concluded that he’d wait until nightfall and then slip away. He couldn’t bear the thought of the device’s potential going to waste, so he’d set out for another settlement, likely New Tulsa.

The cool, underground air reminded him of Red River Biotech. Located at the outskirts of Lubbock, the top-secret lab was situated thirty feet below ground. He stared at the cavern wall, closed his eyes and was back at Red River.

\#

Tate and Dr. Konig were the only ones in the glass-walled conference room. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead. Konig, about twenty years Tate’s senior, sat in a chair, reviewing documents and making notes. Tate stood at the opposite end of the laminate conference table.

“I was a little confused by something that was said yesterday,” Tate started.

“Confused by what?” Konig murmured, his eyes fixed on the documents.

“You mentioned something about a sunset clause. I wasn’t sure what that meant.”

Konig adjusted his glasses. “The trials were a success. But production will be limited for five years. That’s the sunset clause.”

Tate bristled. “People are starving. We should release it now.”

Konig’s voice hardened. “We lost the war. Resources serve the few who can pay. That’s how the government recoups taxes.”

Tate clenched his fists. “This could feed thousands.”

“You built it with their money. They decide how it’s used,” Konig said flatly.

Tate hesitated for a moment, his next words a gamble. “I forgot to mention that the aperture on the Agri-Boost was acting up. The scanning beam wasn’t as concentrated as it should be. I should be able to recalibrate it easily.”

Konig stared back for what felt like an eternity to Tate. “Fix it,” Konig ordered. “The investors arrive tomorrow.”

Later that day, Tate falsified a defect in a QA report to buy some time alone with the Agri-Boost. That night, he stole the device and snuck aboard a transport truck departing the lab. When the truck stopped at an e-charging station, he slipped away.

\#

Around ten P.M., Tate filled his canteen to the brim, then started up the ladder. Dina was waiting for him.

“I figured you’d be leaving,” she said. She handed him a bundle: some dried sweet potato slices, a pair of muffins, and a frozen pot pie. “I spotted the government men talking to Mayor Davis thirty minutes ago, but I haven’t seen them since. Now’s your best chance to take off. I can sneak you through the emergency hatch in the north wall again.”

Tate nodded in agreement. “Let’s get going.”

They moved along Wingspan’s inner perimeter, under the cover of the scaffolding. When they arrived at the emergency door, Dina turned the handwheel and opened the hatch. Stuffing the food bundle into his sack, Tate whispered, “Thanks for everything.”

“Before you go,” Dina started. She looked down to see that she was wringing her hands. “I was hoping I could ask a favor.” Accessing a memory long sealed, her eyes swept across the wall and landed on Tate again. “I have a daughter. She goes by Ally Munroe. She must be about twenty-six now.” Dina fell silent. Her eyes welled up as she spoke. “She and I had a falling out a few years back. She took up with a trade caravan and left. They operate farther north. In eastern Kansas, or maybe parts of Missouri. I don’t know exactly.” Tate listened intently to her plea. “I’m hoping that, if you run into her, that you’d deliver a message from me.”

“Of course.”

“Tell her that…that Momma still loves her. And I hope to see her again someday.” Dina’s hand went to her mouth. 

Tate nodded solemnly at the request. He put one foot through the door’s opening before turning back.

“Under one of the solar sets out here, there’s a tomato plant. It’s small, but it’ll be bigger tomorrow. It should flower next week. Try and take care of it.”

Dina stepped forward and hugged him. “You take care of yourself,” she replied. And at that, Tate disappeared.

\#

There was a stillness to Benny’s room. It was even quieter than usual. No creaks from his weight shifting in his desk chair, no sounds of worn comic book pages turning over. Benny’s body was stuffed in a trunk at the foot of his bed. The room was as lifeless as he was, until the steel call bell connected to the heat gauge gave off a single ring.

\#

Tate crept quietly along the outside wall, keeping to the shadows until the hoverbikes came into view. No agents in sight. No guard in the tower. He knelt by one bike, detached its power cell, and stashed it in his canvas bag before climbing onto the other.

The engine’s hum was louder than he liked. He opened the throttle, aiming for the cover of Crag Rock, a nearby mesa. The rush of air blew his hair back. The speedometer hit eighty before a sharp series of beeps cut through the night. “No…” Tate muttered, watching the panel flash REMOTE SHUTDOWN. The boosters died, the nose dipped, and he was airborne.

He hit hard, pain exploding in his shoulder. The bike flipped into a boulder; his canvas bag landed nearby. Tate crawled toward it — then blacked out.

Tate’s eyes were still closed when he detected approaching footsteps. A kick to his ribs jolted him from his stupor. He let out an agonizing scream. “Do you have any idea how long we were looking for you?” Agent Allen chided. He motioned to the wrecked hoverbike chassis. “And look what you did to my ride.”

Tate rolled onto his belly and made a feeble effort to crawl away. Agent Allen stepped on his ankle. “You’re not going anywhere, doc. Where’s the device?”

“There’s a bag,” Agent Trotter noted, pointing to the canvas pack. He walked over to retrieve it. Picking it up, he gave the bag a shake to assess the contents.

“It’s funny,” Agent Allen mused. “If we found you sooner, then we’d have taken you into custody. You and the gadget. But you had to use the damn thing for these peasants. Lousy scientists always think they know better,” he said, shaking his head. Agent Allen drew his gun from its holster. “Now we have new orders – we don’t need you. Hell, we don’t even need the device. But I’m guessing we’ll get a bonus if we bring it back now.” He aimed his gun at Tate and spoke to Agent Trotter. “Partner, let me know what we have.”

Agent Trotter rummaged through the bag. “Fuel cell for the other bike,” he announced, dropping it to the ground. His hand dug deeper. “I think we have a winner!”

On his back with his hands up, Tate made a final plea. “Wait, you don’t have to do this. Please.”

“Sorry, doc. You knew the consequences.”

Tate looked away, his eyes drifting towards Agent Trotter, who pulled the Agri-Boost from the bag. At that, a sharp click came from the depths of the bag. Agent Trotter looked down to find the Agri-Boost’s water reservoir port connected to the circular pin from a dehydration grenade. 

“What the—"", he uttered. The grenade detonated, engulfing the three men in a storm of beige dust. All three were overcome by the same symptoms: coughing fits, irritated eyes, bone-dry mouths and parched lips.

Agent Trotter dropped the bag and the Agri-Boost. He fell to his knees, furiously rubbing his eyes. Agent Allen blindly felt the ground for his gun, letting out hoarse coughs. Tate forced an eyelid open ever so slightly. He crawled to his bag. Both eyes now shut and inflamed, he fumbled through, producing his canteen. 

Coughing, he slowed only when several paces away from the agents. He opened the canteen and drank, spitting up the first gulp. He took a small sip and sloshed the water around in his mouth. He splashed some on his face, alleviating the burning in his eyes. He took a full sip and, after concentrating, was able to breathe normally again.

Agent Allen was still pawing for the gun, now nearly within reach. Tate hobbled over and snatched the pistol, tucking it into the back of his waistband. He grabbed the Agri-Boost, gave it a quick wipe, and placed it back in his bag. 

Tate wasn’t sure how long the effects would last, but he reasoned that he had enough time to gather a posse from town and figure out what to do with the agents.

Tate shouldered his bag and took two steps towards Wingspan before the ground rumbled. He raised his arm to shield his face from a wave of searing heat, the town suddenly erupting outward. Fragmented pieces of the wall hurtled skyward. The Superhawk’s wings, airborne one last time, soared before spinning and breaking apart. The deafening blast forced Tate backwards. 

Tate stared in shock. Wingspan had vaporized in a flash of white. As black smoke and a menacing orange glow enveloped the town, guilt threatened to consume him, too. He looked back at the agents, both near collapse. They’d done this, but so had he. 

Spotting handcuffs on Agent Trotter, Tate shackled them together, leaving them to their thirst. One last look at the smoke, then he turned away, resolving to bury it all into a barren corner of his mind. 

He figured New Tulsa was the next closest town, about 150 miles northeast. He could try the Agri-Boost there. If he kept a fast pace and took few breaks, he estimated a five-day journey. 

On the bright side, he had a half-full canteen and a top-secret mobile fertilizer. Tate hoisted the bag over his good shoulder and let out a sigh. “I’d better start walking.”",1,1761265977.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1oejuaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oejuaz/dont_become_a_park_ranger/,DON'T become a park ranger,"I’ve always hated my job. When I was younger, being a park ranger sounded like freedom — long hikes, fresh air, solitude. At 27, it just feels like decay. Monotony wrapped in tree bark and silence.



*I used to wish something would happen.*



My daily shifts were always the same: rounds through quiet, wooded trails in SW Virginia. I worked mornings, so I never expected much more than the occasional bear or lost tourist. The sunrise was usually the highlight — pale pink haunting, bleeding through branches like something watching.



That morning started like all the rest.

Coffee. Boots. Silence.



Except for the car.

A red honda civic, tucked alone in the back of the parking lot. Faded paint flaking off like skin. I didn’t think much of it at first. Early hikers are rare, but not impossible. Still, as the hours dragged on and hikers came and went, that car never moved. It just sat there. Watching.



Toward the end of my shift, curiosity got the better of me. I crept toward it. Its windows were coated in grime, like a layer of sweat that never dried. I cupped my hands against the glass, peering inside.



Nothing. No ID. No bag. No smell.

Just an empty driver’s seat, and a faint imprint on the passenger side — like someone had been sitting there for a long, long time.

As I walked off, I realized a dimly shadowed figure reflected off the mirror of the car. Only issue was that I was the only one there at the time.



I told the night ranger in passing. He laughed it off. “You’re a good kid, nothings gonna happen to you. It’s on the inside that counts.”

It partly stuck with me.



Disappearances like these happened before. 

I never assisted in the search though.



Two days passed. I couldn’t stop thinking about the possibilities. 

I felt like I was in a grotesque horror movie and I was the next victim. 

A wimpy 5’8 stick — easier to overlook.



The car never moved. 



By then, the idea had burrowed deep inside me like a tick. I couldn’t let it go. A red car. A missing person, maybe. A reason — finally, a reason — to feel something on this goddamn trail. Even though it shouldn’t have, it exhilarated me. I felt like I, finally, had purpose.



No hikers came that day. The previous night’s rain had scared them off. It was just me and the civic.



So I went looking.



Water bottles. Radio. Flashlight. I told myself I was doing my job, but even then I think I knew better. I wasn’t looking for someone to rescue.



Barely into the trail, I heard a noise: some type of groaning. 

Feeling tense, curiosity forced me off the trail and to the left.

Navigating through the thick and dense bunches of pine trees, I moved where the noise grew louder.



What first sounded like a mumble or groan turned into a shriek, almost making me turn back.

I wondered: 

What if it was the woman in the red civic?

I had to help her.



Thus, I sprang forward, looking for the sound with more urgency.

About two minutes later, I came face to face with what I could only think was a doe.



Its stomach was mauled, almost like a bear got to it.

There weren’t any flies yet, but the smell of guts pouring out almost made me hurl.

It looked unnatural: no human nor animal could be so precise yet malicious.



At this moment, I felt for the woman in the red civic. 

For the isolation in these woods.

For the terror of the unknown — hell, even I’m cautious around these woods.

But most of all, 

For likely being dead.



I knew I had to find her.

I knew this trail better than I knew myself. 



Now the real walking commenced. 



Around the three-mile mark, I found it — a puddle of mud where there shouldn't have been one. Thick. Murky. Unnatural. Like the ground itself had opened to swallow something. The forest felt too still. Birds had gone silent. Air too hot, too heavy, like breathing through wet cotton.



I stepped off the trail.

I told myself I was searching.



But really… I think I was following.

Something.



The trees got tighter the deeper I went, like they didn’t want me there. The underbrush clawed at my legs, and still I kept going. I was driven, but by what, I couldn’t say.



Then, suddenly, I stopped.



Nothing had changed — not the trees, not the light, not the air — but something was wrong. Like the woods had been holding their breath and finally exhaled.



Eventually I reached a clearing. Nothing special. Just a circle of dirt and dead leaves.



In the center was a backpack. Moldy. Faded. Like it had been here for years.



I dumped everything on the ground.



A cracked phone with one photo left in the gallery. 

A selfie of a woman in a red honda civic. Passenger seat. Smiling at someone just off camera. 

I checked the time stamp: 3 days ago.



Upon closer inspection, the woman’s face felt familiar, but I couldn’t place why.



Under the phone:  
  
A polaroid photo that the wind blew away from me.

One thing was left, but it was inside the bag. 

A note. Scribbled in sharpie on the inside flap:

“Don’t let him find you.”



Who was him? 

Was there someone in the forest that was dangerous… or something?



Looking around me, I realized the trees were carved with an assortment of large symbols. 

Triangles, circles, pentagrams; no one had, to my knowledge, been this deep off the trail.



That’s when I felt it behind me.



Like pressure on my lungs. Like being watched through keyholes.



I turned slowly.



A shape stood between the trees.

Tall. Too tall.

Human-shaped.

But wrong.



It didn’t look like anything I was warned about.

It was wrong.

Ungodly. 

It wasn’t walking. It was just… there.

Was it watching, preying on me?



I blinked hoping it would be gone.

It was still there, standing in that awkward position.

The trees around it moved.

Part of me felt terrified. *Only part.*



It got closer and I heard muffled whispers around. 

It wasn’t that I couldn’t make out what they were saying — I didn’t want to.

This all had to be bullshit.



I hoisted my gun and shot at that *thing* twice.

The safety was, oddly enough, already off.

The first bullet hit through the shadow into a tree; the shadow disappeared. 

The second struck something on the ground — a photo. 

I rushed to the polaroid, flipping it over; memories rushed to my mind which shook me to my core. 



*I was the man taking the woman’s photo.* 



Then it hit me.

I didn’t come here to rescue the woman.

I came to finish what I had started.



The others got away.

*The next won’t.*



She had to run off before I could finish the job, though.

She had to hide in the woods — the one place I didn’t think to check.

She had to escape my grasp before I could finally get to her.



I wanted to save her from whatever’s in these woods.



That’s what made my stomach turn. Not guilt. Not fear. Just disappointment.

The game was over. 



I returned anticipating to see only the civic in the lot.



*But it wasn’t.*



And that’s when I knew.

It wasn’t just the girl who was gone.

It was the story I told myself — that I was just curious, just bored, just doing my job.



I mean, I somehow had to entertain myself, right? 

Fuck what other fucking things could I’ve done in SW Virginia. 

I came here, not for the solace of the woods, but the isolation of them. 

It’s easier to prey in the shadows and between the branches than in an open, bustling city.



People warned me about Appalachia. 

The skinwalkers and mimics hunt people.

They drove them out and made them mad. 



*Skinwalkers are not real though.* 



Those shits are made up.

People go crazy from the desolation within the trees. 

The sunrises that are the highlight of their day.



I came here to see something so crazy it would exhilarate me. 

Instead, that lack of terror drove me mad. 



Because monsters don’t come howling in the woods.

They clock in at 5:00 AM and drink black coffee.

They stare too long into cars that don’t belong to them.

They feel nothing when someone goes missing — except a bitter taste when it’s not their hands that did the work.



And the worst part?



The game was over and I had lost. 



*I think I’ll miss the civic.*

*Its blissful red paint peeling off, similar to the skin I planned to strip from her.*



Promptly returning home, I only knew one thing: I was hungry.

Entering my pantry, I finally found the woman — I cried out, clinging to her lifeless body.

She learned to embrace me for who I was; not responding was her form of support.



Now, I’ve invited a woman with a blue Convertible over. 



Blue’s not quite my color. 

Don’t worry, I can always repaint.

Afterall, it’s on the inside that counts.

Their pasta sauces are also not very good because they don't contain olive oil but other cheaper oils which affect the taste. 
Their sliced cheese packages are also smaller. And they don't taste as good.

1oejsf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1oejsf3/im_aware_this_isnt_healthy_but_im_struggling_to/,"i’m aware this isn’t healthy, but i’m struggling to take it seriously because it feels like “finally losing weight easily”","
hi,

i wanted to share something i’ve been dealing with because i feel stuck between awareness and denial. i have a long history with eating disorders. i struggled with bulimia and binge eating as a teenager. i used to be pretty thin, then i gained >!around 30 kilos!< when i was 19 after years of depression and medication. i’ve hated my body ever since. i’ve tried so many times to lose weight in a healthy way, through exercise and balanced meals, but it never worked. i’d end up bingeing, losing motivation and hating myself even more.

a few months ago i was diagnosed with adhd and started taking concerta. it completely killed my appetite. at first it felt like a miracle because my binges stopped instantly and the number on the scale finally went down. since june i’ve lost >!around 8 kilos!<. but now i realize it’s turning into something serious. i can go >!days without eating, just drinking coffee!< and even though i know it’s dangerous, i feel a strange sense of comfort in it. after years of feeling out of control around food, this feels like the first time i’m in control, and that’s a very confusing feeling.

i’m aware that this is probably anorexia, but because i’m still technically overweight, no one takes it seriously, and that makes it hard for me to take it seriously too. i tell myself that it’s fine because i’m “finally” losing weight. i know that’s messed up, but it’s honestly how i feel. i’ve spent so long despising my body that part of me is relieved to see it shrinking, even if it’s happening in a self-destructive way.

physically >!my body is showing clear signs that it’s struggling: my hair is falling out, i’m always freezing, i bruise easily, my lips are pale and dry!< i can feel my body getting weaker, but the fear of gaining weight is still stronger than the fear of being unwell.

there’s also this pattern that’s making things worse. i’ve become dependent on my medication. concerta is a stimulant, and because the prescription is controlled, i sometimes run out early. i end up going >!around ten days without it!< before my next refill. during those days my appetite comes back hard and i binge again. it turns into this constant cycle of two weeks of restriction and two weeks of bingeing. it’s exhausting, and i’m scared of what it’s doing to my metabolism.

i don’t want to live like this forever. i know i can’t. i plan to stop taking concerta eventually, because it’s not sustainable for me, but i’m terrified that when i stop i’ll gain everything back, maybe even more. i want to find a way to stabilize once i start eating normally and healthily again. i don’t want to spend the rest of my life swinging between extremes.

has anyone else gone through this with adhd meds or stimulant-related weight loss? how did you manage to recover or stabilize after stopping? is there any way to avoid regaining everything too fast once you start eating again?

i’m not trying to romanticize or promote restriction. i know this is dangerous and that i need to get better. i just feel conflicted because after years of bingeing and feeling powerless, losing weight feels rewarding even though i know it’s not healthy. i just want to understand how to find balance again.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

Please complete Step 1 of your interview: send a recent photo and a proper introduction about yourself. Step 2, I’ll provide mine.

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

I enjoy gaming and currently playing Battlefield 6 and Monster Hunter Wilds. I play other games like Sword Art Online, Like A Dragon, Overwatch2, Apex, Dynasty Warriors, Persona 5, Tekken and TFD on my Series X, Switch, and Steam Deck. I like listening to city pop while riding my longboard, studying, and working out. A very chill day for me would be a rainy one with ramen, early 2000s tv and halotop ice-cream. I’m introverted and chill, taking each day as it comes. I enjoy texting and receiving voice notes, so I don’t mind listening to you talk about whatever’s on your mind. It would be fun to play games together online, and if we’re in the same area, I’d love to visit my favorite bookstore, grab a black coffee, go to the movies, or enjoy some sushi. If you’re interested in having a gaming buddy, let me know what games you play!",0,1761265117.0,MakeFriendsOver30,2,0.5,False
1oejl3j,https://i.redd.it/thbuj9sedywf1.jpeg,Freedom,"*”The silence grows weaker, the darkness with my unknown companion’s presence fades. I can see it, the light at the end of my tunnel.”*

*”Is this my way out, or is it another ordeal I must burden myself with? Or could this be my last breath, and thought on this world.”*

*”…no. It’s really the way out.”*

*”These shackles may keep me bound, from getting to my feet, but the sounds… people talking, birds singing as dawn rises, the smell of the cool breeze coming through the open windows, and the unmistakable smell of coffee.. it’s all real.”*

*As I opened my eyes once more, still seeing the lively and slightly peaceful environment of Manhattan’s Cafe that had reopened, and saw young u/Haru-Urara enjoying her hot chocolate so peacefully.*

*”I made it out. But how?”*

*”Was it them? The names I cried out to help for…? Who knows, but I’m finally free. From the prison I was help captive in for far too long.”*

*I closed my eyes once more, the unnerving all-consuming silence I would hear every time was gone, replaced by the lively atmosphere before opening them once again.*

*”Finally, I’m truly free…”*

*I thought to myself before reaching out to move my oxygen mask aside, and slowly held my cup of hot chocolate made by Cafe herself. The aroma was soothing, bringing my body a feeling of warmth I haven’t felt in years with the first sip I took.*

*”The Kikuka Sho is coming up, I should inform Dr. Saaka (u/DoktahSAAKA) to have everything in the infirmary on standby… I’ll tell her later instead, she’s most likely busy with training.”*

*I slightly looked to my left to watch as the morning sun continued to rise from the horizon. It was a beautiful sight, one I should witness more in this place. A monumental day, for when I have truly gained my freedom.*",2,1761265104.0,Umaddit,0,1.0,False
1oejl2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EntertainmentNext242/comments/1oejl2u/mostly_true_stories_from_a_halfdecent_man/,Mostly True Stories from a Half-Decent Man,"I’m no sage, no scholar, no genius with a plan.

Just a man with a full gas tank,

a half-charged phone,

and a map that never quite matches the road.

I travel light

some coffee, snacks, a notebook full of bad lines,

and a head that hums like a fridge at midnight.

Room-temperature IQ, maybe slightly warmer on good days.

I’m a modest scribbler with a soft spot for stories

collecting moments the way kids collect seashells

most cracked, some sharp, all worth keeping.

I talk to strangers like they’re old friends

and to old friends like I might never see them again.

Every face is a mile marker;

every story, a bit of gas that gets me farther down the line.

I celebrate the crooked path

the one with too many wrong turns

and one dive bar that serves both despair and bourbon.

The jukebox knows my sins by heart.

Do I contradict myself?

Constantly.

I want solitude, then get lonely.

I crave company, then need to leave.

I’m a walking argument wrapped in denim, flannel and good intentions.

But listen

somewhere between the gas stations and the sunsets,

between the missed exits and the kind eyes of strangers,

I started to think this might be enough.

The world doesn’t need another genius.

It needs more people who wave back.

More who notice the smell of rain

and pull over just to watch it fall.

I am just me

a traveler, a talker,

a fool with a pen and too many opinions.

I’ll never climb Mount Enlightenment,

but I’ve seen its shadow stretch across a two-lane road at dusk.

And that’s something.

That’s enough to keep me going,

writing one more crooked line

in the long, unfinished song of myself.",1,1761265103.0,u_EntertainmentNext242,0,1.0,False

Maybe this is crazy that I’m resorting to Reddit BUT I’m a 24 years old (f) currently looking for a good young adults church community. For a little backstory, I currently go to a church with mainly an older generation. I am basically the only young adult lol. There is nothing wrong with that of course, but I don’t really connect with anybody there.😭My church experience there is much longer than that, but I’m not gonna go to much into detail. It’s already difficult making friends my age in general when it comes to living here. I pretty much do everything by myself PLUS what everyone says you should do to meet new friends like go to the gym, hike, go out to eat, visit and study at local coffee shops, but still haven’t managed to meet anyone that way. I’ve thought about visiting Bible Center, but was wondering if there’s any other churches or groups that someone could recommend?",3,1761265075.0,charlestonwv,2,0.8,False

Whiplash & Confused,"I 35(F) met this seemingly amazing guy (42) over Bumble. He’s funny, smart, engaging, cute, and engaging. Our first date was a coffee date, where we couldn’t stop talking for hours. We didn’t want to leave. Our second date was wonderful: dinner where we talked for hours & were kicked out for talking for hours, strolling around a downtown square with Halloween decorations, and a first kiss that turned into a make-out session. We talked everyday. Both excited to see each other. We promised to not get physically intimate for a few weeks as we just started dating, which is cool with me. 

Well… Our 3rd date was supposed to be tonight with us going to a retro arcade. 30 minutes before I was supposed to go pick him up… He texted and canceled with the excuse that he’s tired with a sore back and with no definitive plans for that rain check other than maybe next week.

My last post about the crushing pressure to have a kid and clinging to my free-spirited self through hookups with friends and a colleague got a lot of you talking. The comments calling me a “whore” and saying I “belong to the streets” felt like punches to the chest. I get it—my actions aren’t something everyone can stomach, and I’m not proud of sneaking around, but those moments of feeling desired, confident, alive have been my oxygen when my marriage feels like it’s suffocating me. Still, those harsh words lit a fire under me. I don’t want to be this version of myself forever, hiding and hurting. I love my husband with every fiber of my being, and I want to save us. So, I ripped myself open this night, confessed my pain, and tried to fix our marriage. His response broke my heart, and now I’m more lost than ever.
I sat him down, my hands trembling, tears already spilling. I told him I love him so deeply it aches—how he’s my home, my partner in crime, the one who gets my weird humor and makes my coffee just right. I love our lazy Sundays, our shared playlists, the way we dream about our future. But I couldn’t hold back the truth anymore. I told him our marriage feels hollow, like we’re roommates stuck in a routine. Our sex life is a ghost, and it’s tearing me apart. I miss feeling wanted, that fire that makes me feel like the bold, sexy woman I know I am. I begged him to see me, to care, to fight for us. I suggested couples’ therapy, thinking we could rediscover that spark together. I was raw, vulnerable, laying my soul bare, hoping he’d meet me in that messy, honest place.
He just looked at me, calm, like I was overreacting about a spilled drink. He said, “Babe, sex isn’t everything. I’m happy without it. We’ve got a beautiful life—our evenings together, our talks, our home. That’s what makes us strong.” He went on about how he loves our quiet moments, how he feels close just cuddling or laughing over some stupid meme. He said, “I don’t need sex to love you. You’re my world.” It felt like he was brushing me off, like my pain was just noise he could tune out. I tried to make him understand—sex isn’t just physical for me. It’s where I feel alive, confident, like the woman who still turns heads in her favorite dress. But he just gave me that soft, patronizing smile and said, “You’re overthinking it. We’re perfect as is.”
I snapped. My voice shook as I pushed back, telling him I’m dying inside, that I’m terrified of losing myself to the “wife” or “mom” everyone’s shoving down my throat. I told him I feel invisible, like the vibrant, untamed part of me is fading, and I need him to fight for us, to see me. We argued—not screaming, but sharp, each word cutting deeper. He kept insisting we’re “fine,” that I’m blowing it out of proportion. I felt like I was screaming into a black hole, my pain disappearing into his calm dismissal.
Before bed, I tried one last time to reach him. I slid close, kissed his neck, ran my hands over him, desperate to feel something—anything—that would make me feel wanted. I was playful, flirty, hoping to spark even a flicker of what we used to have. But he pulled away, muttering, “My parents are here for the festival. It’s not right to do that now. Doesn’t look good.” I lost it. In a burst of anger and hurt, I blurted, “Why do you ignore sex so much? If you want babies so bad, you need to fuck me hard to put a baby in me!” It was raw, desperate, maybe even cruel, but I was so tired of feeling unseen.
He just sighed, like I was a child throwing a tantrum, and said, “Babe, you’re angry right now and not thinking properly. We’ll talk after my parents leave.” Then he kissed my forehead, rolled over, and went to sleep. I lay there, tears streaming down my face, my heart in pieces. His parents were downstairs all evening, dropping not-so-subtle hints about grandkids, piling on the pressure, and he couldn’t even hold me when I was falling apart.
I didn’t even get to confess about the hookups. I was ready to—I swear. I wanted to tell him I’ve been sleeping with other people for a year, chasing that rush of feeling desired because I couldn’t find it with him. I wanted to say I’m done with it, that I want us to be enough. But after he dismissed my pain, my anger, my plea for intimacy, I choked. How do you confess something that heavy when your husband acts like your needs are irrelevant?
I’m shattered. I love him so much it hurts, but I feel like I’m begging him to see me, to want me, and he’s just… not there. His “we’ll talk later” feels like another dodge, another way to avoid facing me. The baby pressure is crushing me—his parents’ comments, my parents’ “you’re not getting younger” jabs—and now I’m questioning if I can stay in a marriage where I feel so invisible. How do I take this? Is he just avoiding conflict, or does he really not care? Has anyone else felt this—like you’re screaming for your partner to fight for you, but they just turn away? How do you love someone when you feel so unseen, so unheard? I wanted to save us, but now I’m terrified we’re too broken. I’m carrying this guilt, this confusion, this heartbreak alone, and I don’t know what to do",3,1761264408.0,sexlessmarriage,0,1.0,False

Here are a few often-overlooked ones and simple ways to fix them:

**1️. Loose Rugs & Mats**  
Rugs that curl at the edges or slide easily can trip you up.  
*Fix:* Use rug grippers or double-sided rug tape, making sure corners lay completely flat – or, remove them entirely!

**2️. Cords & Cluttered Walkways**  
Extension cords, phone chargers, or even shoes in the hallway can easily become obstacles.  
*Fix:* Route cords along walls or behind furniture, use cord covers, and keep pathways clear – especially in high-traffic areas.

**3️. Low Furniture**  
Coffee tables, ottomans, and footstools can blend into the background until you bump or trip over them.  
*Fix:* Arrange furniture to allow wide, open walkways, and consider lighter colors or corner protectors for better visibility.

**4. Dim Lighting**  
Poor lighting makes it hard to spot small obstacles or changes in floor level.  
*Fix:* Add brighter bulbs, motion-sensor night lights in hallways, and lamps near commonly used chairs or beds.

**5️. Pets (Yes, really!)**  
Pets love being underfoot — and that can lead to trips, especially in tight spaces.  
*Fix:* Consider reflective collars for nighttime visibility, and teach pets to stay clear during movement with gentle cues.

Even small adjustments can make a huge difference in preventing falls at home!

One night at the resort, two days at the park, the kids are 2 and 4. I can't help but overplan, which brings me to these six questions... (and any other advice is welcome...)

1) The 4-year-old is maybe just a hair under 42 inches. How strict are they about the height requirement for Dragon? 

2) The park apparently opens at 11. Any tips for what to do between breakfast (already snagged a rez at Bricks Cafe, based on rec in a prior post) and park open?

3) When should we arrive for park open? When it says it opens at 11, does that mean they start scanning tickets at 11, or is there a Disney-style ""rope drop"" situation? 

4) Is there any decent coffee in the park or the hotel?

5) I'm planning to pick up dinner in Goshen and bring it back to the hotel... has anyone done this? Any recs for where to pick up from? 

6) Is Reserve and Ride worth it? I was thinking of not buying it because two days seems plenty to ride everything (and the price seems high given admission price), but then again, the kids are pretty impatient.

By Vera Lovealot
Filed from Penthouse 7B, The New Spiral Complex

The lights of Market Square glittered below like spilled jewelry as Vera Lovealot leaned back in her mother’s old telephone bench, pencil poised and eyes sharp. The chair creaked in its familiar rhythm — her grandmother’s rhythm, too — the same one that had carried the gossip of three generations of women into the pages of The Evening Harold.

The bench still smelled faintly of lavender polish and strong opinions. Her mother, Estelle Lovealot, once wrote the column “Hometown Hearsay,” and her grandmother, the formidable Ruby Lovealot, penned “Straight from the Switchboard.” Now Vera had inherited not just the seat, but the silence that followed every juicy whisper before the pen hit paper.

She twirled the phone cord absently around her finger, listening to the party line hum with life — six calls deep, overlapping laughter and gasps. From that swirl of chatter, she began to jot:

“Mavis Butterbean swears Archie Ballsnatch once alphabetized the cafeteria trays.”
“Doris Wimple believes Imagrabba was responsible for the fire at the junior prom.”
“Someone named Tilda has seen blue light near the fountain — again.”

Her cursive was quick, confident — the kind that wrote what people didn’t quite mean to say.

Outside her window, the last daylight dipped below the balloon stand where Archie’s name still hung crooked. Vera smiled, a little sadly, a little like someone who knows more than she’s willing to print just yet.

“Some stories,” she whispered into the receiver, “don’t start on the party line… but they always end there.”

Then she snapped her notebook shut, took a sip of cold coffee, and smiled toward the dark. Tomorrow’s Evening Harold was already halfway written.",0,1761263948.0,TownshipGame,0,0.25,False

If I am in an extremely deep nap  for 1-2 hours  after being utterly exhausted, for example i was up for 19 hours , and then i was so so so exhausted, and then i slept for 2 hours and i feel so well rested that i feel i will be up for another 19 hours. this often happens to me, that i have almost euphoric energy and feel rejuvenated. i don’t drink caffeine or coffee. and it’s because i simply don’t need it. this is a pattern that’s happened most of my  adult life. i’m 32 female.  when i hear other people talking about not being able to function unless they get 6-9 hours of sleep it’s something i can’t relate to. yes occasionally i do sleep like a normal person, but what im describing of feeling like i got eight hours of sleep after 2 (usually only happens if i am utterly exhausted to my capacity) then that two hour nap literally could keep me up for an entire day

Also something to add with further is that when i wake up from a sleep, i am so euphoric, sometimes very horny (f32) , can be aggressive not physically but just like intense idk it’s hard to describe.

the most fucked up part of  all  of this is that i’m so ashamed  of is all i do is doom scroll on ig for hours when i could be actually doing something useful, like learning a new language or organizing my room. i never understood why people need coffee, or feel tired, it just doesn’t happen to me, then eventually i crash, and sleep a deep 2-4 hours and then the euphoria can last another half a day or i could be up for another 19 hours.

of course there are times where i do sleep 7-8 hours normal, shocking those days i wake up more like a “normal” person i suppose, without the euphoria.

also something to add is i know for sure i should probably be doing a little bit of running or more exercise, because wherever the f is wrong with me exercise would only help

when i tell people im unproductive and someone sAys something like take adderol (which i did in highschool and that was a fucking night mare) i tell them i literally feel like have natural adrenaline..",1,1761263902.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

If you’re into Star Wars I’ll set up a light saber fight for when you come over or exit the bathroom, likewise with a dual consisting of wizarding wands. I’m going to want to snuggle on the couch. I’ll want to sit out at night and watch the stars while we listen to complete silence. I’ll want a kiss on the hand and forehead. I may even want a twirl or short dance if there’s a good song on in the store. But also, couldn’t we just enjoy a damn good cup of coffee in the morning? 

I’m quirky, spontaneous, ambitious, and maybe a hopeless romantic.

The Story of Larry Niven and the Ringworm, July 9th, 2025 - October 23rd, 2025

Short version without the personal hardship, confluence of hard things and hell this journey included:



* Adopted a kitten on July 9th, 2025. On the way home we noticed he had obvious ringworm.
* Stopped at CVS to get a topical anti-fungal, Lotrimin AF, and put it on his spots when we got home after a bath and made a Vet appointment for the next morning.
* Installed kitten in the guest bathroom which was all tile.
* At the vet the next morning they gave us a topical, miconazole nitrate, which we started using once a day right away. The vet wanted to do a PCR test (they didn’t do cultures) to confirm, but having had extensive experience with Ringworm, I was positive this was what we were dealing with and moved forward with treatment. It should be noted that we also declined the PCR as it would *only* confirm the presence of the ringworm DNA, not if it was live, or the strength/stage of the infection as a culture would.. The vet also prescribed an oral anti-fungal, Itrafungol, and a bunch of other crazy expensive tests to confirm. We elected to start with the topical and get the kitten’s immune system up to snuff before starting an oral med as it can be hard on kittens and can damage their liver among other possible side effects, we felt he was just too young (six-seven weeks). Also, ringworm is most prolific in animals or humans with depressed immune systems. At this point we stopped with the AF over the counter as we had the topical from the vet. I have done cream topical on cats before and seen it done in conjunction with the sulfur-lime dip, but this time, with having such a young kitten I did my homework and elected not to go that route but to go the vet directed path. Did it take longer? probably. Is my kitten currently super healthy now that this is all over.. yup.
* At this point I shaved (clippers, clipped short, not \*shaved\*) his bad spots to remember where they were and also hit them with the topical better, he had a big spot on his hind hip, several small patches on his feet and his ears… were both pretty bad. I didn't know till later that clipping or shaving the hair super close to the skin on infected spots can be an irritant and make the situation worse, but I didn't shave him, so that was good as that apparently is the worst thing you can do. We didn’t figure out the Black light test till a little later in the story, but when we did, he did glow at his whiskers and the fur and skin around the spots as well… I \*think\* we had already knocked it back pretty good at this point, but we didn’t really figure that out till later and still went forward with the full treatment to be sure of it not coming back and to protect our other house cat and ourselves before letting him loose in the house.  
* I had some left over KMR SECOND STEP (powdered replacement milk for kittens) which I started him on as well as a can of wet food (meowmix) a day and a dose of leftover (from our senior kitty) senior cat joint compound, SENIOR CAT LICKS, which has fish oil and L-Lysine and other good things to boost his immune system. 
* July in Las Vegas is crazy hot, but we had a section of the yard we cordoned off to have full contact play for a few hours in the morning and in the evening. I believe this saved us from having a sad or angry kitten during this process. 
* I used a tea tree shampoo, conditioner and body wash from Trader Joe's which also had rosemary in it, both being natural antiseptic and having anti-fungal properties, I later made a rosemary tea to put in my hair after showering to further prevent infection and also help my scalp recover from the excessive showering. I showered twice a day, after every play time with the kritten. I also used Clorox wipes while hanging out with him to clean my hands or any place he had been on me. I used a topical Anti-fungal on any spot that looked the least bit suspicious and also used it as a preventative application every time before hanging out with the kitten on any cuts or scrapes or vulnerable skin spots I had. I tied my hair in a bandana, I would put kitten away, vacuum (I had a dedicated hand vacuum for his bathroom) his space/clean his box/wipe down the floors and walls, and then wipe my shoes with Clorox before leaving his space and strip all my clothing directly into the washing machine and run them with bleach and laundry detergent on hot after a 30minute soak. Then I would shower and move on with the day until the next round. This all happened 2X a day, for the duration of this treatment which was 9 weeks. 
* Two weeks into treatment we started bathing the kitten every other day (or 4X a week) in a shampoo, MiconaHex+Triz for cats/ringworm. We did this for three weeks and kitten was fattening up, feeling good, and was a lot of work but a cheerful little dude and we felt it was time to step it up and go the oral treatment route. We also, at this time, elected not to go the sulfur-lime dip route… not doing the oral and dip treatments earlier undoubtedly prolonged this treatment period, but the potential side effects, kidney and liver impacts were just not something we wanted to risk and we were willing to put in the work.
* 5 weeks into treatment, the kitten was doing well, so we went back to the vet. We saw a different (better) vet and got a broad antibiotic (oral liquid for 12 days) to help with any underlying infection, a ear mite treatment (i had been cleaning his ears with every bath but it was obvious there was some underlying thing with mites) which were once daily drops for 14 days in each ear which was the thing he HATED the most of this whole saga, the Itrafungol (oral liquid that he took like a champ) which would be a five week treatment - one week on, one off, one on, one off, one on and it lingers for another week, so, six-ish weeks.  We continued bathing every other day. He was still glowing a bit on the ends of his whiskers and some hair follicles, but there was \*significant\* improvement in the first week. 
* After a week or so, I noticed that the topical Miconazole seemed to burn his skin and promote scabbing, as he wasn’t glowing (black light test) anymore at this point except the tips of his whiskers, I decided to stop the topical and continue with the Miconazole every other day bath. There was IMMEDIATE improvement in his skin and things started clearing up \*very\* quickly. 
* At this point we continued with isolation and twice daily play times till the last week of being “on” (actively taking) the oral meds. His ears cleared up very quickly and were fine by the end of the ear drop course. He put on weight, was happy, and seemed super healthy. I will note that during the “on” weeks of the oral fungal.. I noticed his poops would get a bit runny and there was some blood, not \*in\* his poop, but at the end of his poop and it seemed it made his butt… a little tender/not so great. This cleared up with no issues in the off weeks and I read that it can be a common thing for this med to be hard on a kitten’s stomach and… for lack of a better description… butt hole. At this point we were also transitioning him to kibble and less wet food, so I believe that was a contributing factor. We monitored him carefully, were in contact with the vet, and all turned out fine. 
* Three days before the end of his “on” cycle of the 5th week of oral treatment, we started turning him loose (on a leash/harness just as our other cat was) in the part of the yard where we take our other cat out, they had been staring at each other for weeks across the yards and started getting to know each other. When they started interacting and playing (the bappening was happening) I used a combination of Antibacterial/antifungal wipes from Smiling Paws for coats and paws post-pay, and Ear Therapy - lactic acid, ketoconazole and saliclic acid for their ears, this may have been over kill, but I wasn’t about to FAFO after so much time and effort.
* At the end of the last week “on” for the oral fungal, we started letting Kritten out during the day and putting him away nights. At this point I was using RING OUT, a PH spray on common areas and for the now shared litterbox. After a few days of this we started doing once or twice a week, then weekly baths, and stopped using the sprays and wipes and what not and just went for it. At the 9 week mark.. Kitten still had a bit of dandruff/skin flakes around his ears and still got weekly-ish baths, but did not glow at all and hadn’t for a few weeks. So we felt like we were in the clear. I will note that when we let him loose, I think I made a mistake using the RING OUT on both the litter box and things like couches and blankets, the litter was otherwise unscented and I think he got confused because this towel and his litterbox then smells so similar due to the Ring Out being used on them both, so, it was only once, and as soon as I realized the probably cause and fixed it, it was fine. so, that's something to keep in mind as you transition to freedom. 
* As I write this, it has been 30 days since we have let the kritten (KRAKEN/KITTEN), Larry Niven, fully loose in the house. Neither my partner, our 7 year old resident cat or myself have contracted ringworm. Larry is happy and well-adjusted with the exception of one thing… I sorta trained him out of being super snuggly while he had ringworm by necessity. Sooo… we are working on that. In three days he gets his trouble fluffs taken care of, and winter is coming, so I think that will help with the schnuggles. Other than that, I was intensely saddened not to get that early super tiny kitten experience, but we lifted him out of a bad situation and gave him the care and put in the work that he needed. So, at least we know we have a \*lucky\* kitten. And.. he is pretty darn cute still and handsome. His weight was just under 1.5 lbs when we got him, now he’s a robust and squirrely demon of nearly 6lbs. So, winning.  

PART 2 -

Longer version, less meds and more feels and stuff.

I lost my old man cat of about 22 years a little under one year before we adopted this kitten to keep our other 7 year old cat company after he lost his friend. My partner was having surgery in a week and wasn’t going to be able to lift 10 or more pounds (our cat was 10lbs) and was going to be recovering for quite a while. As our current cat was pretty much his doggo, we decided it would be an ideal time to get a kitten and use the week before surgery to integrate it into the house so they could play together while my partner was recovering and I was helping him. I will say it turned out to be fortuitous that neither of us had to work or travel during this time as we had marked it for his recovery and had planned to be home, another reason we felt this was the ideal time to adopt a friend for Steven.

We found a 7 week tuxedo on craigslist (our cat was also a Tux) and went to go check him out. The folks who had him brought him to the door and we gave him a cursory look over. The house smelled strongly of cat and cat pee, there were two adult cats on the stairs we could see, including a tipped orange male they referred to as having, “started all the trouble"" which was a little weird to me as he was tipped.. but maybe i was just seeing things. I turned to my partner and was like, can we have him? So, we paid the $30 rehoming they asked and left. I didn’t look the kitten over closely, he was chill, a tux, medium short hair, super cute, seemed fine and it was July in Las Vegas in the sun outside someone’s apartment… not the best conditions to give Kitten a thorough going over. So, we leave. Kitten is chill, I didn't even need to bag him. I’m playing with him and looking him over more… bam… big spot of obvious ringworm on his hip that was concealed by his slightly longish hair. Kept looking, small spots on paws, ears are a little rough. I’ve had experience with ringworm, I helped a family member who had show cats that got infected from a doggo she was sitting for and know it well. Also grew up on a ranch where it came and went with regularity. I knew how hard it was to deal with and the importance of not letting it overrun the house and how very contagious it is. So, I turned to my partner who was driving and said, “he’s got ringworm.” 

We couldn’t take him back there, where it smelled so bad, where his environment was obviously not one where this was noticed, or if it was, then they were perhaps people who would give him away without saying anything or at least not have the means or the will or both to treat him. So, U-turn to CVS for a stop-gap topical. 

The kitten, with luck, never set paws in the house in general. We had an all tile guest bathroom where we immediately put him. He was a bit grumpy about his newly curtailed freedom, and bath, but he adjusted well, was playful and super tiny and cute. What we did and how we did it is listed above, so i won’t go on about that here, just that it was \*HARD\*. So cute, so little, no schnuggles, no letting his cute little face bump my chin or face, so many rules, my ovaries were... sad. 

As soon as we got him home, I felt it was the responsible thing to do to let the folks we got him from know what was up... I had been texting with the mom who was at work when we picked him up and so I texted to tell her of the situation... She declared she had no idea and asked if we wanted to bring him back. I said we would keep him and already had a Vet appt. and a treatment plan but that she should be aware of it as it was highly contagious and people could get it as well as her other house cats, how to treat it if they couldn't do a vet and also what it looked like on people/how to treat that etc. It was.. a longish exchange... they said they didn't know anything was wrong with him, we kept him... is the short version. 

A week later my partner’s surgery happened, all went well. 2am the next morning, my partner wakes me up. The drain had backed up after I set the dishwasher to run just before I went to sleep. It had flooded the kitten bathroom, the living and dining room and my studio. My partner couldn’t lift anything, couldn’t be around what could be grey water, was feeling pretty awful and so was I. Soo, He and our other cat repaired to a not-flooded office and I rescued and bagged the flooded kitten, poured a large bourbon, and set to work. It took me three hours to clean and disinfect everything, unclog the drain and set the kritten environment to rights. Thank god for the tile. At one point my partner, feeling pretty useless and sad, looked at me with pity and distress, and I had to be like, “you know, we could start over… we could sponsor him at a shelter, make sure he gets treatment and taken care of, and we could start over later.” Now, my partner is a disabled veteran, and we both knew the feels in the idea of not keeping and helping something that was a little messed up… so I looked at his face and said, “ok, but you can not pity me for how hard this is and will be, you can’t do it and you can’t feel sorry for yourself for not being able to help.” and so it was.

It was a loooooong, and very hard time. Gone were the coffee and book hours we used to share on the shady side of the yard in the mornings and evenings, I was cloistered on the lava rock sunny side and he was on the shady side with our other cat trying not to cross contaminate. This went on for the duration… 9 weeks.

We had company during August for several days and moved the kitten back and forth from the guest bath to the master bath with intense deep disinfecting with every move. My partner, with healing incisions and underlying immune issues had zero contact with kitten, so, while making liquid meals a few times a day during his recovery, drinking probably more than I should, putting on brunches and hosting friends, showering twice a day and using bleach with abandon, my skin hated me and it was.. HARD. Did I mention it was now August in Las Vegas? So.. it was 108-115F every day and didn't get under the high 90s at night, which was both good and hard. Good because the part of the yard ringworm kitten played in was baked in sun with an average UV index of 12 for 6-8 hours every day between play times.. So.. good for killing any ringworm spore, shitty for me and the kitten to be out in. So, I would wake up at five or six am to take him out for a few hours while it was still shady, and again in the evening till 11pm or 12am, during the coolest hours of the day. He was awesome tho, took his meds like a champ, ran and played and was adorable. He slept through the night (and still does), but… As a result of spending so much time alone, he is a very independent kitten and likes to sleep alone, not the best for me who wants all the kitten schnuggles now that he is worm free. He is confused by kisses and face play and when I huff his little fur belly. He does well with having his tummy and paws touched but again, is just… used to spending time alone and especially sleeping alone. Is used to PLAYING ALL THE PLAYS with us tho, so there is that. So, I totally missed out on his Kittenhood and it kills me. But he’s lovely, plays and has become friends with our other cat and helps him stay in shape with lots of play and generally life is super good. We’re working on getting him to be a little more cuddly, but also, I think he runs a little cooler than most cats, meaning, he loves the cold tile, and gets hot pretty easily, not the best for schnuggles... this was also a trial during outside play time in the summer. Ice packs were his between play jam and he still loves the cooler temperature things. We shall see what the winter weather brings.  A few days ago, after being loose in the house for a few weeks... I woke up to him laying on my chest just looking at my face, still sorta sleepy and purring and I about lost my shit and had to work pretty hard not to immediately overschuggle him back. The first time he fell asleep on my foot during a couch nap.. I cried, no joke. 

So, that’s probably not everything, but it was most of it. It was a long, difficult, stupid time and I knew rather than believed that there was light at the end of the tunnel. Kitten was lucky we got him, we did the thing… we won. But… NEVER AGAIN. Through it all, I would turn to reddit and faceSpace ringworm support groups for support or hope or whatever tricks and tips I could find. The #1 issue was... people were in it.. and when it resolved, there was no followup, only the rare conclusion to the story we who were in it were looking for, the end, the success, the hope of a realized and confirmed conclusion to the story wasn't there... As soon as it wasn't hard anymore, it seemed folks didn't come back to the groups to say so.. they were, of course, probably enjoying their kitten. So, if you were wondering why this was so long... I was determined to wait till we won the game, 30 days out of quarantine, to write our story and put it out there complete with hope of a finish line for all those who are still deep in it, or just starting on the long wormy path.

So, if you’re emotionally fragile, don’t have the space or the time, don't have the right home support... don’t take this on… find someone willing to foster ringworm kittens, they exist and freaking bless them all to success and health and happiness forever you gems you. Also, if you can’t afford it… you \*can\* treat this on the cheap.. But there is no way to tell if it will be a hard case or not, easy to get rid of with a topical or if you’re going to need vet care… I think kittens is about $400 right now and that doesn’t begin to include personal time, emotional investment or physical effort. 

So, 30 days (past the long incubation period of ringworm) later… and we’re good. Wish us luck, and wish this kitten a \*loooong\* and happy life paying the back interest on his treatment with lots of schnuggles and kritten joy. To anyone who is still deep in it.. I hope this helps you, I hope you get it done, I hope you win too. Good Luck!",1,1761263534.0,u_patchkinz,0,1.0,False

So far the only consistent side effects are extreme fatigue on day one after each shot. 

The first week I ended up getting sick on day 2. Figured out that it was because I hadn’t eaten enough throughout the whole day and only had a big dinner before the shot. Learned my lesson and thankfully have avoided that outcome again. With the help of Zofran as well. 

The second week I was constipated for an entire week and suffered awful stomach cramps. After taking a laxative and paying the price, I’ve been trying to up my water intake and have been taking a fiber supplement every day. 

So far this third week I’m still constipated, but not has bad as last week. I seem to manage some sort of BM every 2-3 days. Prior to zepbound I was everyday. They also leave me feeling like I have more to… retreat? If you know what I mean. 

I’m struggling with increased hydration big time. I’ve been managing at least 48oz of water daily. Increased fiber intake + supplements and protein.  intake. Yet still constipated not sure what more I can do. 

I don’t want to take a laxative again because it was brutal, I’ve contemplated stool softeners but not sure that will help if I’m backed up. Tried coffee today and managed a little movement but even that was pebbly. 

Seems like I can’t catch a break, I’ve been so focused on the side effects I haven’t been tracking my weight. 

Any suggestions are appreciated, I’m trying to add magnesium supplements to my regimen today too.

1oeivlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1oeivlo/an_open_and_constructive_letter_to_bethesda/,An Open (and Constructive!) Letter to Bethesda regarding CC content implementation on the upcoming Anniversary Edition of FO4.,"Unlike most comments I'm seeing regarding the Anniversary Edition of FO4, I'm actually excited for this release only because I'm curious to see how the CC content is implemented throughout the game, particularly if we get it Skyrim-Anniversary-Edition style where we encounter quests for them naturally rather than being inundated with them as soon as we exit Vault 111. There are few suggestions however that I, **a nobody on the internet**, would like to make regarding some of the creations (I'm particularly proud of my idea for Morgan's Spacesuit). I realize since you're releasing this in November, everything's probably already done and no changes will/can be made, but here it is anyway! (PS: if none of these changes can be made, perhaps some enterprising modder will see this as a roadmap to use themselves...)

* **All Creations with quests in general:** This goes for any Creation that already has a quest associated with it. If we're not getting these automatically once we leave Vault 111, don't forget to change the opening-stage quest descriptions in the Pip-Boy so we don't see stuff like ""I heard a group of mole-rats stole some advanced technology out in Cambridge. I should go check it out.""
* **All Creations ""dumped"" on you when you leave the Vault:** This includes multiple items you get to start with that appear when you leave Vault 111. They should be obtained in other ways. Suggestions:
   * **Handmade Shotgun and Modular Backpack:** Since these are found abundantly, we could either simply find these naturally or instead perhaps we find them in a ""Courier's Stash"" trunk in Sanctuary, along with some shotgun shells and a letter of resignation from some unnamed courier from out west who took the cross-country job hoping for a big payday only to discover the recipient was dead. **Also regarding the Modular Backpack**, could we maybe get a bit of verisimilitude in the form of certain NPCs wearing these? I'm thinking traveling merchants and their guards? Plus, there's the fact that the bedroll-version of the backpack has no mechanical difference other than taking more supplies to create and (I think) weighing more. Could there be some Survival mode implementation where sleeping somewhere while the bedroll-version is equipped maybe reduces the chance of acquiring a disease overnight by some small amount?
   * **Doom Classic Marine Armor:** This is our chance to better implement this Creation with the Doom BFG Creation. I don't mean Mercy needs to wear these, he's already powerful as it is, but I think it'd be cool if we get a miscellaneous quest after defeating Mercy to enter the Glowing Sea Red Rocket nearby to read Mercy's note about leaving certain artifacts with his flock, and the PC gets to retrieve this armor and helmet from 1 or 2 Glowing Sea locations with abundant ghoul populations, like the sunken church. (PS: I like the idea of Mercy talking about a vision he had where the armor appeared before him spinning in mid-air).
   * **TransDOGrifier:** The promotional image of this Creation says it's from RobCo, but come on. Canine-focused super-science? This has Dr. Borous from Bit MT written all over it. We start the game knowing how to craft one of these at a chemistry station, but I feel that should be locked behind acquiring the items first. I say we actually get a quest that eventually leads us to Dr. Nordhagen's grave, [someone mentioned in a terminal in Vault 111 as not making it to the Vault by the time the bombs fell](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fnew-playthrough-i-found-that-nordhagen-beachs-founder-might-v0-9uno3nao1of91.png%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D8cc1051a34c87e8c6aee0a16162a6b42d9e71837). Left on their own, he or she eventually became a ghoul, and spent their time trying to get in touch with whomever was still out there. Eventually Dr. 8 of the Big MT found their messages, and the Think Tank started trading messages back and forth. Upon learning that the Commonwealth had a sizable dog population, some of which weren't even mutated, Borous sent Nordhagen a care package with the collars inside. Nordhagen, who had founded Nordhagen Beach at that point, thought the items were ridiculous but kept them around in case they could trade them for supplies. Nordhagen eventually died in a raid, however, and their body (and the collars) are buried behind the shack.
   * **Morgan's Spacesuit:** This Creation, like a number of other creations, are crossovers from other games. For the most part, these creations aren't really implemented into the game in an immersive way (with the exception of the Fantasy Hero Set Creation!). Instead of getting this automatically (an INCREDIBLE source of rad resistance at level 1), we should get it via a quest. How to implement immersively though? [This item looks an awful lot like the Y-17 trauma override harness from Bit MT](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Y-17_trauma_override_harness). Combine that with the androgynously named Morgan Yu from *Prey* where this item comes from, and we get a story about a young and promising scientist who agreed to work for Big MT after it was suggested that not doing so could see his Chinese-born parents placed in the Little Yangtze internment camp nearby. Yu joins and begins work on the Y-17 trauma harness program, specifically a radiation-resistant variant that could be used in space. While testing the harness outside of Big MT's perimeter on October 23, 2077, the blast from nearby bombs that fell interfered with the biometric scanners and the suit no longer detected Yu's life signs within, despite Yu still being very much alive. On top of this, telemetry data was also corrupted, and rather than the harness taking Yu back to the X-8 research center, its coordinates defaulted to the non-existent [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island) at 0°N 0°E. With no way to override the harness's return protocols, Yu was resigned to being an unwilling passenger as the suit made the slow trek east, eventually dying from starvation and thirst, but not before leaving messages to their parents and whomever finds their remains. **At some point, the suit finally reaches the eastern shores of the Commonwealth where it begins an automated beacon transmission for sea transport (that won't ever show up) to bring it the rest of the way to Null Island.** This is how the quest starts for the player, with their Pip-Boy picking up the radio frequency of the transmission (possibly at a later level). Following it will bring the player to a hostile enemy wearing the suit, **whose sex matches whichever sex the player chose for their character, who is incapable of voicing any kind of dialogue or pain noises, and whose character model is incapable of being ""gibbed"", dismembered, gooified or turned to ash.** Maybe the enemy also gets flagged as a robot for the purposes of Legendary weapon and armor effects. Once defeated, the player character can interact with the corpse, which dumps the suit into their inventory as well as a holotape that has Morgan Yu's notes, observations, and final thoughts, as well as the suit's ""black box"" data which details a number of reports over the centuries, including how the fight with the player destroyed the suit's automated mobility functions, leaving it as nothing more than a rad-resistant piece of clothing. Finally, once looted from the corpse, the corpse should disappear and be replaced with a skeleton.
* **Chinese Stealth Armor:** This was one of the first Creations so I get why its quest was less involved than later ones, but such an amazing piece of equipment should probably have a better quest than ""kill some gunners and just take it from a trunk."" Suggestions:
   * Maybe it needs to be repaired and the Gunners can't figure it out. This can be achieved with the PC providing junk supplies to repair or perhaps bypassing that with sufficient ranks in a perk or SPECIAL score.
   * Maybe it needs MULTIPLE stages of repair. One funny idea I had is that all of its diagnostics are presented in Chinese, and the PC either needs to pass with an 8 Intelligence, a 10 Luck, or they need to acquire a misc item in the form of a translation module from an old defunct Liberator robot a trader found in Appalachia...
* **Hellfire Power Armor:** Since the Enclave Remnants creation gives us additional ways to acquire this power armor, it's not necessarily as big of a deal now if we can't kill Pyro due to local fauna killing him first (like stingwings), but that could still bug his quest, so to speak. [There's also the potential issue of not completing this before Blind Betrayal.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pyromaniac_(quest)) It may be a better idea to either relocate him or remove local hostile fauna in his area. Alternatively, perhaps he has the same role as Bedlam in Dunwich Borers where he's sent out to quarries to look for scrap metals for the Forged, and Pyro only shows up some time after the player either helps Sully Mathis drain Thicket Excavations or kills him instead of helping him, the idea being that Pyro was ""negotiating"" with Sully's raider gang to scavenge the quarry.
* **Horse Power Armor:** Creation is mostly fine, but maybe we can find a note or terminal entry at East City Downs about some crazy raider who tried to join the robot race himself before he was chased off. Also if there's any bark-dialogue from Arlen Glass's voice actor that would indicate shock, perhaps that gets said the first time you approach him in this armor. Finally, as far as quest acquisition goes, I like the idea of increasing the number of case files you can find and start in Nick's detective agency, and this one seems like an easy candidate. Finally, there's a minor typo in Scabby's log 10/18 entry. First sentence says ""this past few days"" but should be ""these past few days"".
* **Fantasy Hero Set:** No notes! This is the gold standard of crossover content in that it 1) brings us to an unmarked location we may otherwise skip over and 2) implements an in-universe reason for these items to exist. My one suggestion though would be to better arrange how these items are placed in the ""throne room"" where you find them, as it's possible for them to clip through the floor and be unobtainable. Also, the quest completes when you open the door to the throne room, not when you retrieve the items, and so it's possible a player may overlook these rewards once they see the quest is completed, especially at night when the items can blend in visually with the ground textures.
* **Graphic T-Shirt Pack:** This is where I get on my soapbox a little and plead that if you're going to make this Creation an automatic part of the Anniversary Edition, please limit how abundant the shirts are in it. The reason why is because as a retro-futuristic atompunk game, Fallout's pre-war setting was one steeped in the culture and fashions of the 1940s, 50s, and early 60s. Graphic T's however, are more of a 70s and 80s thing. Sure T-shirts existed in these decades, but they were simple, often plain white affairs associated as undergarments and with military usage in the 1910s, 20s, and 30s; and then eventually used as a symbol of rebellion in the 50s and 60s (think James Dean and your typical greaser). Obviously the bombs fell in 2077 and so the 1970s and 80s were still a thing that happened, but if we're trying to maintain verisimilitude with the setting the game begins with, it would stand to reason that type of clothing fell out of style. Graphic T's should instead, in my opinion, be treated as novelty items—fun souvenirs from Nuka-World or promotional items from Nuka Cola (ala the Nuka Cafe Creation), or collectibles like the note in Hubris Comics mentions regarding the trunk of T-shirts in the back closet. **What I'm trying to neck-beardily say is that it'd be great if these shirts were only ever found in containers or bought at clothing stores and not part of what an NPC could potentially spawn wearing.** The less often I can see these in the wild, the better intact my immersion will be.
* **X-02 Power Armor:** Kris Takahashi always does good work so there's not much to say to this one!
* **Pint-Sized Slasher:** This is a great candidate for the quest to start via a new case file item to be picked up in Nick's detective agency. Perhaps a draft of a public notice in Piper's terminal telling civilians to be careful when traveling around college square.
* **Vault Suit Customization:** This one only has a miscellaneous quest associated with it, but it's one that pops up when you first exit Vault 111. Even before you leave Vault 111, there are new vault suit items added by this creation that show up during your escape from the vault. Maybe picking one up could be what starts the misc quest? One bug to point out is a graphical glitch in Vault 111 in the bunk area attached to the kitchen. In the vanilla version of the game is an unusable, busted locker. This creation puts a usable locker there instead where some vault suits can be found, **but doesn't remove the busted locker originally there, it just overlaps it**. This results in the locker looking like it has two doors: one closed and one ajar and damaged.
* **Various dog creations:** No notes other than better quest starts! ""Missing"" posters at settlements seem like the easiest and lowest-effort way of adding these, **though I did spot in the trailer a new doggo in the form of a cyberdog like Rex, so who knows what's happening there.**
* **Sentinel Control System:** Is this guy too overpowered? I'm told he can technically be downed like a companion, but I have yet to see this happen in my games. Also, if it's not already, can we have robot repair kits work on this guy? The only other suggestion I have for verisimilitude is to maybe add a terminal entry on the Prydwen about these MIA soldiers.
* **Settlement Creations whose content you get automatically:** This covers a number of Creations that I feel should instead have their content unlocked through player-action and exploration:
   * **Settlement Ambush Kit:** The defensive walls you gain from this Creation alone are enough to argue you should earn these instead of getting them automatically. My suggestion would be to add a new magazine, [possibly even the fan-made unofficial one you see in the artwork for the thumbnail for this creation](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/c/c9/FO4CC_PF_Settlement_Security.png/revision/latest?cb=20180829172336), that unlocks all of this Creation's content. I would then suggest you pick a thematically appropriate place to find this magazine, such as on top of the tower in Lynn Woods given what you can do up there.
   * **Home Decor Workshop Pack:** Add a new Picket Fences magazine with all of this somewhere in the world.
   * **Modern Furniture Workshop Pack:** Ditto.
   * **Arcade Workshop Pack:** Perhaps these are only unlocked once you find the corresponding game magazine for each one?
   * **Virtual Workshop:** Perhaps it'd be better to find a copy of Tesla magazine that unlocks the ability to create the VR workshop pod at a settlement.
* **Anti-Materiel Rifle:** Quite possibly my favorite quest associated with a Creation. The only way I can think to start it would be finding a ""Prologue"" chapter to bring you to the Museum of Witchcraft. One thing worth mentioning is that with any player choice presented in a CC quest, the choice the player makes should have companion affinity changes, and this should go for the choice you make at the end of this quest if it doesn't already (haven't gotten to test it yet the way I have some other Creations).
* **Doom BFG:** Other than implementing this with the Doom Marine Armor Creation I mentioned above, the only other note I have is to do *SOMETHING* regarding the ammo for this weapon showing up everywhere in containers in-game. I feel like it should be rare? Maybe even alien-blaster-ammo rare (or close to it)?
* **Prototype Gauss Rifle:** Maybe give the gunner commander that's using this weapon a name?
* **Solar Cannon:** Great quest, cool weapon, but there's a visual error on the weapon itself where the fusion cell is inserted backwards.
* **Tunnel Snakes Rule!:** As with all the other Creations that add quests to the game that start by asking the player to listen to a radio station, one persistent bug is that if you do not listen to the radio station soon after acquiring the quest, the quest becomes bugged and listening does not progress to the next stage. This is one of those Creations and should be fixed. Fortunately even if bugged you can still progress by just finding the location on your own, but still.
* **Captain Cosmos:** This is the gold standard of great Creation design, with a great quest, new interior area, unique assets; a tertiary feature of collecting toy boxes, the ability unlock new settlement decor, a new weapon, clothing, and power armor, and seamless integration into the lore of the world. A few things to point out though:
   * The fact that the cryo-version of the cosmic cannon still takes fusion cells and not cryo cells is a little weird. Likewise, the sonic blast version of the cannon does what Lorenzo's Artifact gun does, so should that version use gamma rounds?
   * In speaking of the cosmic cannon, does it take up more of the screen in 1st-person view than it should?
   * The fact that the cosmic cannon and CC-00 power armor paint options expand depending on what factions you've aligned yourself with seems like a feature that similar types of paint jobs for armor, power armor, weapons, and even pip-boys should have used.
   * Upon leaving Hubris' television studio, back to Hub 360, my player character loaded in and was just standing on a bottlecap mine I must have missed when I made my way into the studio.
* **Zetan Arsenal:** Only suggestion is to maybe delay this quest from starting until after level 20, which is the trigger for the UFO to crash land. Perhaps the crashed UFO was a scout and the aliens from this Creation were right behind him. Also it's worth mentioning that if this quest is going to start later, there was a bug I encountered while using a mod that did this. The mod simply delayed acquisition of any CC quest until you got closer to where the first stage of the quest would ask you to go. When it came to this quest, I went to the bridge where you find the dead farmer and his cow, but neither was there and no quest started. When I went to Graygarden, the quest suddenly started but because I had already loaded the zone where the bridge was located, the farmer and cow never spawned again and the quest couldn't be completed. Not sure if this is a universal issue with quest design.
* **Heavy Incinerator:** No notes other than better quest acquisition!
* **Manwell Rifle Set:** The only suggestion I have for this is in regards to the choice the player has to make at the end. The quest designer was cool enough to add companion-affinity reactions when you make this choice, but not for the DLC characters. Since this will likely be in the Anniversary Edition, where Far Harbor and Nuka World are included, Porter Gage and Old Longfellow should get included here:
   * **Old Longfellow:** One choice has you hunting a creature, the other has you sparing the creature. Being a hunter, I could actually see Old Longfellow reacting positively to EITHER choice (the glory of hunting a legendary creature vs. the wisdom to let a unique creature live and potentially sire offspring just like it).
   * **Porter Gage:** So weirdly, Gage actually does have an affinity reaction but not a normal one. Normally when a companion dislikes or likes something, they take a 0.75% loss or gain to their affinity with you, followed by a notification in the top left of your screen indicating they liked/disliked that. When killing the radstag, Gage doesn't feel anything because the DLC characters aren't implemented. If you SPARE the radstag, however, Gage's affinity with you drops by 0.1% and there's no notification that appears saying he disliked it. Not sure what's going on there.
      * One additional bug to point out is that in earlier playthroughs, after I had spared the radstag and sent it to one of my settlements, anytime I would show up to that settlement with Porter Gage as my companion would result in the radstag being marked as hostile. Not sure if that's because of some kind of ""raider"" tag Gage has on him. I didn't notice this happening in later playthroughs, so maybe it was fixed?
* **Quake Thunderbolt:** Another crossover Creation needing better immersion. Best suggestion I have is to say this weapon is an invention of the engineering team at the Institute; a group of rogue scientists' secret pet project they need to hide because it's a waste of power. There should be terminals within the institute that reveal a bit of backstory about what's happening here:
   * Imply the contenders are people taken by the Institute but rather than be disposed of, the group here broke protocol and kept them alive to use as pawns for weapons testing (and for gambling among the scientists as to who would win).
   * Whomever designed the weapon, perhaps their notes mention Skyline Valley in the Appalachian region as a location where data was collected when designing the weapon.
   * Another terminal in the Institute implies security is aware of the unauthorized use of power, specimen containment, and gambling ring and is attempting to locate those responsible.
   * Once the player clears the crater of ghouls and then the combatants, perhaps it is populated again with gen-1 synths who were sent by the scientists to collect the weapons.
   * Goodness but this weapon takes up a lot of the screen in 1st-person view!
* **CR-74L Combat Rifle:** This Creation holds a special place in my heart because I love the Commonwealth Travel Guide you use during it. In fact, my main suggestion is to add more location entries for us to use to ""talk"" with Lily and Mary Jane! Not many suggestions:
   * Minor typo on the travel guide. East City Downs is misspelled as **Easy** City Downs.
   * Artis can sometimes be glitched. One time when going to Lexington, he had clipped through the building he was on the top of and fallen to his death in a space you can't enter without console commands or using a trick to glitch through the wall of a building. You need to interact with his corpse to retrieve his scope plans.
   * Not really a bug, but Mary Jane's corpse, which is very close to Sanctuary, has some pieces of leather armor on her. One of these items is of Sturdy quality and I believe another is either Sturdy or even Heavy. Felt like pointing this out since a level 1 character can easily obtain these.
* **Tesla Cannon:** Cool quest, just some bugs to point out:
   * The Tesla-Beaton assembly modification will also chain through friendly NPCs. Not sure if that was intentional.
   * According to the wiki, there's apparently a verified bug where removing all items from the bodies of the dead Gunners may cause their bodies to disappear. They can still be interacted with, but won't be visible.
* **Makeshift Weapon pack:** Suggs' weapons are great but some of the ammo should be able to be found in other locations: nails at construction sites and hardware stores, sawblades at those locations also as well as anywhere Mr. Handy robots are made/operate (General Atomics Galleria, Graygarden, General Atomics Factory), 40mm grenades on the Yangtze...
* **Gunners vs. Minutemen:** The only suggestion I have for this is to add companion affinity reactions at various stages of this quest, specifically if Preston is your companion and especially when finishing it.
* **Various ""Player-Home"" Creations:** Going to combine these onto one bullet point since they're all so similar:
   * **Charlestown Condo:** No notes other than I wish entering this location didn't also discover the USS Constitution location and potentially start that event before I'm ready.
   * **Nuka-Cola Collector Workshop:** No notes other than maybe add a bottle of Nuka-Dark, Nuka-Grape, Nuka-Victory, Nuka-Orange, Nuka-Wild, and Nuka-Quartz somewhere inside, indicating the owner was a true Nuka aficionado and giving the player possibly their first taste of the other Nuka flavors before they make it to Nuka World. Also maybe make the cross-promotional bobbleheads one-time finds that don't respawn to make them feel like true collectibles?
   * **Noir Penthouse:** This location has a [severe graphical bug](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/2e/2024-05-14_Early-Retirement-Fallout4-penthouse-bug-floor.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20240514205515) involving invisible floors and walls that started after the next-gen update. Also, this is another like Tunnel Snakes Rule! where not listening to the radio frequency the moment you get the quest can result in it not progressing if you decide to listen later (you can force it to progress by going to campus law offices). For verisimilitude, perhaps a terminal in Synth Retention in the Institute lists retired courser safehouses, mentioning this and Neon Flats. Finally, this quest involves a player-choice where the player has to either erase the data of two known synths, making them untraceable to the Institute, or killing them. It's odd that neither of these choices results in any kind of companion affinity reaction (ie: X6-88 should probably HATE it if you erase their data).
   * **Shroud Manor:** No notes other than this is an excellent candidate to have the quest begin via  a case file in Nick's detective agency, considering how mobster-themed it is.
   * **Neon Flats:** Every player home so far has been behind a locked door that can't be picked and requires a key, except this one. This one BY FAR should be behind a locked door considering it's in Goodneighbor where the majority of residents sleep on the streets, so it's a bit weird they wouldn't enter this unlocked building and curl up on the pristine leather couches in the lobby. Whatever change is made to this Creation to have the quest for it gained more naturally in the Anniversary Edition should probably start with the player getting a key to this location.
* **Coffee and Donuts Workshop Pack:** Love this one and great implementation with Survival Mode! Only suggestion is to maybe reduce the weight of the donuts (unless 1 lb. donuts are a common thing in Boston I'm not aware of). One other thing is in regards to the Nuka Cola mixed drinks introduced in Nuka World. Nuka Cola drinks have an added effect in Survival of caffeinating the character, which is cool, but what about Nuka Free? Its components suggest it's maybe a diet-version of Nuka Cola, watered down but still caffeinated, but it's nomenclature is more akin to the caffeine-free tag you see on some soft drinks like Sprite.
* **Holiday Workshop Pack:** Not like the other settlement packs since this one is acquired via a quest, so that's nice. Just needs better quest acquisition but something as simple as a misc. quest to check the ""notice board"" when you first enter Diamond City to find Mr. Zwicky's request for help could be what starts it.
* **Halloween Workshop Pack:** Another settlement decor Creation locked behind a quest, and a pretty fun one at that. This is another ""listen to this radio frequency"" quest so if you don't listen immediately, it could get bugged like Tunnel Snakes Rule! and Noir Penthouse. Here's a suggestion that may or may not be possible within the game's engine: perhaps this radio frequency doesn't appear (and therefore the quest doesn't start) until the actual in-game date of October 31st arrives. The date from when you exit Vault 111 isn't too far away from this date, so it's not like it'd take forever to get it started. As far as content, why does the felt hat give a unique zoom-in when picked up as if it were legendary? Also, Lana's note ending with an exclamatory outburst of being attacked seems hilarious when you realize she was handwriting it out as it was happening. Perhaps it should probably either abruptly end or be turned into a holotape to imply her words were being transcribed into text.
* **Capital Wasteland Mercenaries:** Really like this one. Only suggestion is to make sure all empty Nuka-Cola bottles are removed from the GNR Plaza location. It's apparently canon that the rocket-shaped bottles were a regional thing and the more ""traditional"" bottle shape was used in other areas, like what would eventually become the Capital Wasteland. Unless someone's going to design a new empty bottle item, it's probably easier just to remove any rocket-shaped bottles from the area. Also, does MacCready have any appropriate bark-dialogue that could pop up if you happen to bring him here as a companion? Anything like a ""Home Sweet Home"" or ""I hate these guys"" kind of thing?
* **Enclave Remnants:** Despite being the newest creation and apparently one of the better implemented ones, I haven't actually gotten around to this one to test it and see it play out. [All I can therefore do is link to the wiki page for the quest which has a few potential bugs mentioned there](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Echoes_of_the_Past).
* **Various Skins:** Finally, there's the various cosmetic skin Creations, which includes paint jobs for armors, weapons, power armors, and Pip-Boys. Currently, all of these skins are unlocked automatically when you download them and start your game. Here are some suggestions for implementing these as ""unlockables"" for the player to get through their actions.
   * **Power Armor Skins:** The Atom Cats are kind of an underutilized group within the Commonwealth and don't really play much a role, nor does the player have much cause to ever really visit them. Perhaps Power Armor paint job skins can be purchased from a new vendor at their location.
      * A note about the Desert Camo and Swamp Camo power armor paints. Apparently there's a bug, [as mentioned by this mod's description](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30210), where the improved sneaking effect you get when all armor pieces are painted with the same camo paint isn't applied correctly.
   * **Halloween Skin Bundle:** Maybe these can be unlocked upon completion of the Halloween Workshop Pack quest.
   * **Camouflage Paint Job Bundle:** Here's an idea, instead of gaining these automatically, how about instead we breathe new life into arguably the most useless Wasteland Survival Guide magazine, the one found at Gorski Cabin that just shows the location of Diamond City on your map (something that could already have happened if you stopped by Abernathy Farm or spoke with Trashcan Carla), and have that magazine also unlock these three skin types for your weapons, armors, and Pip-Boy. The magazine is essentially giving you tips on how to get there, so unlocking these through the magazine implies it's giving you tips on how to get there SAFELY.
   * **Faction-based paint jobs:** Take a page from how Captain Cosmos did it and unlock these only after you have allied yourself with them.
   * **Shi paint jobs:** The only mention of the Shi as far as I can tell is when you're traipsing through Kellogg's memories, so maybe these unlock through completion of that quest.
   * **Superhero-based Pip-Boy paint jobs:** Perhaps unlocked once you find your first issue of Unstoppables?
   * **Nuka-Cola-themed paint jobs:** Perhaps unlocked once you become the overboss?
   * **All other paint jobs:** If they're just basic paint jobs not necessarily tied to something, maybe just stick them in that paint job vendor over at the Atom Cats I suggested above. This can be the solution also for the superhero- and Nuka-Cola-themed paint jobs mentioned above, if my original suggestions are too flimsy.",2,1761263100.0,fo4,2,0.67,False
1oeivgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1oeivgp/another_jw_story/,another jw story,"  
I never thought I would write this, but like most of you here we are…

A little history. Both my partner and I grew up as JWs. I had been pioneering since I was 14 (baptized at 11). And my husband was baptized at 15 and a need greater/pioneer out of school. Typical overachieving JWs. We got married in our early twenties and our goal was to go to go to BCC (Now SKE) and be in the circuit work or go to Bethel. Some type of “Special” Full Time Service.  He was a Regional Convention speaker, on the Hospital Liaison Committee, Pioneer School Instructor and General Overseer of dumb shit. We worked on that goal until February of this year when everything blew up. 

We had moved to our last congregation to “Help” and for my husband to be COBE. The congregation is completely dying. My husband is in his late thirties, so considerably younger than the body (the average age was 70s), and was assigned to help bring them up to date with the branch and his goal was to show some much needed love. They were known as the judgmental policing congregation. He wanted to help the friends get some relief from that environment. So he started with small changes and made a lot of efforts to respect the experience of the older brothers, but that was still too much. He didn’t go after people when they tried to leave, he wouldn’t make people feel guilty for their mere existence or hating service (we both always hated it, so we were known as the pioneers that were up for breakfast or coffee), and we were generally too laid back for their taste. 

So in February a small group of elders called our CO and told him lies about us and basically said that my husband no longer wanted to be COBE and it would be easier if they could just replace him at the next CO visit. He agreed (without talking to my husband). Then that group of elders called my husband and said the CO said he wasn’t doing a good enough job and he felt like he needed to resign as COBE. Which my husband is easy going and just said fine. He hates disappointing people so he was very sad and felt awful the brothers felt that he wasn’t doing a good enough job. (Of course a lot of past trauma from hearing that your never good enough in your entire life in this org)

Then this small group of elders told him they were going to have a meeting to discuss who would be the new COBE that weekend. That my husband shouldn’t attend because it would be awkward. At that meeting that small group told the entire body that he didn’t show up because he doesn’t care about being COBE. Apparently the other elders disagreed because some of them really loved him and felt that the change he was making was needed, and they wanted to support him. However in the end the loudest bossiest elders had kept a ton of doctored records of dealings with him to “prove” he wasn’t a good enough COBE, or doing things the way they wanted them done. Even if it was against the branches directions. So they got their way and they appointed a new COBE. (One of the brothers in the small group who schemed to get him removed) We weren’t surprised it was him, his goal is to run the congregation like 1940s Germany. 

They wanted him to continue serving so it looked like it was a united decision. But I knew he couldn’t serve with people that betrayed him, so I encouraged him to step down. He stepped down. They were extremely upset. Which led to them to non stop calling, stopping by, etc. It didn’t work, and we hadn’t gone back to meetings since it happened. Which only intensified the effort. They then started having people watch us. They kept detailed reports on where we went, when we went there. If we had people at our house, who, what they said about what we said. It was insane! Literal time stamp reports on us.

My husband called the CO and told him what was going on and told him he needed to get the body to leave us alone. He did make them stop. Then they called all our previous congregations (All over the country mind you, we had moved several times to “help” so we knew a lot of people)  and started rumors about us.  Saying we were getting divorced, and doing all these crazy things.  But they said it was because they were trying to “help” us because they “love” us (Puke)

They kept telling us we weren’t being peaceable and humble. That we needed to get back to meetings and fall in line. Which just infuriated my husband more because he hadn’t said a negative word to anyone about anything. And after everything they put him through to say that when he quietly went away. His lack of presence in the congregation affected the vibe immediately. Everyone was really shook by the suddenness of him stepping down. The couple kids that are there kept asking where he was, they were drawn to him because he loves video games and he is just a kind warm guy that lets them be themselves, unlike the other elders. I know the elders saw that and were upset. (They wanted him to have a local needs on how the kids shouldn’t be playing any video games, and he had said no) They did have that local needs after they removed him.

But at that point we still didn’t know if we should come back (for Jehovah and our friends and family) 

Meanwhile and separately we started to read things online. For me it was this sub (ironically mentioned to me by a brother, thanks friend, if you are reading this). For him is was more you tube videos. But either way we found out the truth about the truth and slowly shared with each other. Which has been fun to deconstruct, get mad, and share stupid stuff we use to believe. We even watched the annual meeting and played drinking games, highly encourage. 

Our plan was to continue to fade. Both of our families are in… his are complete PIMI, and mine are PIM-I,O,Q (A mix of all) so we wanted to try to keep those relationships. 

However on private Etsy and Pinterest accounts that aren’t even attached to my name and follow no one, I pinned some holiday and mystical stuff, for my hopeful eventual future.  Someone did a deep dive on me, and screen shot, and sent out to both of our former friends/family. Which led to our reckoning. So we each finally sent in our DA letters. 

The last thing I would like to say in my Apostate acceptance speech is the thing that surprised me the most is the true love outside the borg. What I expected was judgement for staying in an intolerant group for so long. Because after all we are “objects of hatred” 🙄 and all we see is videos on how people outside find us awful. But what I received was complete empathy and understanding of my waking up. Specifically ive gotten close to a trans person. And since they are so wonderful I didn’t even want to tell them the group I was a part of hate who they are, for fear I would lose them. But when I did, it was the warmest and most healing of conversations ive ever had in my whole life. Im so grateful that I get to have people like them in my life now. 

I keep saying it’s been the worst/best year of our lives. I hope the stalking will stop now that we’ve each made the clear choice and I hope my story is of benefit to some because hearing everyone else’s was very helpful to me. Much love!",5,1761263088.0,exjw,4,1.0,False

In effort to help others what I collected from this subreddit:

1) yes use coarse ground.  I use the Oxo grinder and set to 13.75
2) I use the oxo cold brew maker with an oxo paper filter 
3) 12 oz (wt) of beans to 56 oz (wt) of water 
4) 18 hours brew time on counter 

Here’s what cracked the sudden “silt” issue as I switched beans:

5) never stir the coffee beans after you add water or especially just before filtering the coffee.  Just used the back of spoon to press grind down after adding half the water for 3 minutes then add rest of water and again only press down grinds, never stir.

Today’s yield was back to “normal” over 32 ounces of concentrate that I dilute 3:1 with water only for my daily joe.

Over the past few months, rent prices across Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Downtown Brooklyn have climbed steadily, fueled by limited Manhattan inventory and renters seeking more space and lifestyle perks.

Since the pandemic, Brooklyn has evolved from a “more affordable alternative” to a first-choice destination for professionals, creatives, and families who value community and character. Many tenants who once signed short-term leases in the borough are now renewing for multiple years, creating even tighter competition.

Another key factor? Remote and hybrid work. With more people splitting time between home and office, renters are prioritizing sunlight, balconies, and proximity to coffee shops over tiny Midtown studios. Landlords have noticed — and pricing is responding accordingly.

Recent market data shows that average one-bedroom prices in Brooklyn are up nearly 7% year-over-year, with luxury units and new developments seeing even stronger growth.

So, what does this mean for you?
If you’re a renter, move quickly — the good units are going fast, and waiting could mean paying hundreds more per month. If you’re a landlord, this is your moment to showcase upgrades and capture premium interest before winter slows demand.

New York’s market never sleeps — and right now, Brooklyn is the borough to watch.

Gave myself 6 months to make it work.

First month was a disaster. Built 3 different MVPs following all the Twitter advice. Built in public, posted updates, engaged with founders.

Zero revenue. Zero traction. Nobody cared.

I was building what I thought was cool. Not what people actually needed.

Then my friend who exited his SaaS for $400K told me something obvious but brutal.

""Dude, stop guessing. Just find what people are already complaining about and build it.""

So I did.

Spent 2 weeks digging through Reddit, app reviews, forums. Looking for patterns. Real complaints from real people.

Found a tool called BigIdeasDB that saved me a ton of time. It had like 25,000 Reddit complaints already organized. Helped me spot patterns way faster.

Narrowed down to freelancers complaining about client communication being scattered across 5 different platforms.

Validated with 20 people. 17 said they'd pay.

Built an MVP in 3 weeks. Super basic client communication hub.

Launched on Reddit.

Month 1: $1,200 MRR

Month 6: $25K MRR

312 paying users.

What actually made it work:

Research before building. I spent more time finding the right problem than coding the first version.

Speed over polish. My MVP had bugs. The UI was trash. People still paid because it solved their actual problem.

Weekly iterations. Talked to users constantly. Shipped what they asked for. No fancy roadmap.

My daily routine now:

Morning: 2 hours building

Midday: customer calls

Afternoon: marketing and content

Same coffee shop. Same schedule. No burnout.

The lesson: stop building random stuff hoping it sticks. Go where people are already complaining. Find the pattern. Build the simplest version that solves it. Ship fast.

Market research is not sexy. But it's the difference between guessing and knowing.

If you're stuck, stop coding for a week. Just listen. Find 50+ people complaining about the same thing. That's your idea.

Then build it faster than anyone else.",0,1761262250.0,SaaS,2,0.43,False

1oeih1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1oeih1n/looking_for_vacation_destination_recommendations/,Looking for vacation destination recommendations!,"Hello,

I've recently had a group vacation plan fall through, and I'm trying to find a destination that will fit my preferences for a solo vacation! My vacation days are scheduled for the first week of December and can't be moved. 

\-I don't enjoy the heat, and I have fun in all the elements. I like a sunny day, but a little rain, some clouds, or a light snow won't scare me off, although I'd prefer to stay away from somewhere with a lot of snow just for packing and travel purposes. 

\-I am 30 years old, male, and LGBT. My vacation would need to be somewhere where I can travel safely. I'm an introvert at heart, and like my peace. While friendly polite conversations are fantastic I'm not looking to make friends on my trip. 

\-I enjoy hiking and being out in nature, but I am no expert. I would also have a great trip riding public transit in a beautiful city, and looking at architecture, having coffee on a patio in a cute local cafe, or reading a book in a beautiful cove seaside. I like fine dining, and being pampered, but can have just as much fun grabbing a dinner solo at the bar in a pub. 

\-While I don't want to spend an insane amount of money my budget is pretty flexible. I'm hoping to make this trip an international trip, but I am still a novice, so an easier country might be better. 

\-Some trips I've enjoyed in the past: Hiking in the Lofoten islands of Norway, Hiking through Rocky Mountain National Park with pampering days in Boulder and Denver, City hopping between Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver on Amtrak.

\-Trips I am considering: Positano, Italy with a day trip to Pompeii, hiking path of the Gods, and days reading by the sea while having espresso and nights having fancy dinners up and down the Amalfi coast. A Tui River Cruise making stops in Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary with fancy meals on board, quiet comfortable atmosphere, and freedom to visit a new city each day. Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia. Also, maybe Mykonos/Santorini Greece? Would Japan be too hard to visit in a week for a novice international traveller?

Trips I have ruled out for now: Patagonia, Chile it will be too hot for my liking when it comes to hiking, and it is high season so their parks will be busy. Dolomites, Italy as that is a trip I am saving to take with my partner.

\- I know this is a huge ask of random strangers on the internet, but I appreciate everyone's thoughts! I am so stuck it has pushed me to make my very first reddit post here! Have you taken a trip that fits my vibe, or have an idea where I should go? I appreciate all feedback, let me know! Thanks!",1,1761261970.0,travel,2,0.67,False

1oeidkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oeidkm/youre_wired_for_survival_not_happiness/,"You're wired for survival, not happiness.","I've been deep-diving into the way our brains are wired and the real impact it has on us. Recently, I explained that weird trap where your brain gives you a dopamine reward for imagined effort instead of real action.

But what I found beyond that is even more fundamental. This is the real reason it often feels like your own mind is working against you

It all clicked when I saw a post here about the world being more negative than positive.

I totally get why it feels that way. It really does.

But I realized it's not that the world is objectively worse... it's that our brains are literally wired to focus on the bad stuff. Our brain's main function isn't to make us happy; it's to keep us alive. And to a brain that evolved to avoid threats, ""happy"" is a luxury, but ""safe"" is a necessity.

Think of it as your ""caveman brain"" - a paranoid but well-meaning security system that's stuck in the past.

That’s why we get stuck in these loops:

You get great feedback on a project all week, but then your boss has one tiny piece of criticism. Suddenly, that's the only thing you can think about, and you feel like a total failure. Your caveman brain is screaming, ""That criticism is a threat to your status! Your job might be on the line! Hyper-focus on it!""

You have a great night out with friends, but you said one slightly awkward thing when you left. You lie in bed cringing, replaying that one moment for an hour, completely forgetting the hours of fun and laughter. Caveman brain: ""Social misstep! The tribe might exclude you! This is critical!""

You want to start a side hustle, ask someone out, or just go to a new gym class. The moment you think about it, you feel a wave of anxiety. Your caveman brain panics: ""Unknown situation! Potential for failure and embarrassment! High risk! Stay where it's safe!""

You aren't “broken” or ""too negative."" You're literally being bossed around by an ancient system that thinks you're still fighting for survival on the savanna.

So, knowing this is the case, how do we actually overcome it? How do we retrain this system?

We can't delete the wiring, but we can take back control. 

First, acknowledge the alarm, don't obey it. When you feel that irrational fear or start obsessing over a small negative, literally say to yourself: ""Ah. That's just my caveman brain trying to protect me. Thanks, but I've got this."" This simple act of naming it separates you from the primal fear. You're not fighting it; you're just noticing it, which robs it of its power.

Second, manually collect the good data. Your brain has a terrible memory for positive events. You have to manually build the evidence. Every night, just write down one thing that was neutral, okay, or good. It doesn't have to be huge. ""My coffee was perfect this morning."" ""I finished that report I was dreading."" You're literally forcing your brain to acknowledge that the world isn't all danger.

Third, take a tiny ""brave"" action. You can't think your way out of this. You have to prove to your brain through action that new things are safe. So, don't try to run a marathon. Just put on your running shoes. Don't try to launch a business. Just brainstorm one idea for 5 minutes. When you take that tiny step and survive, your brain gets a new data point: ""Huh. The human did that scary thing and we didn't die. Maybe the unknown isn't so bad.""

But the real game-changer, the final piece, is this: we have to remember this is our default setting. For the rest of our lives.

So when you actually see something good - like, you see someone help a stranger, or you hear a song you love, or someone gives you a genuine compliment - you can't just let it wash over you. Your brain will want to.

You have to stop. Seriously, stop. Pause for two seconds and actually let it sink in. Think to yourself, ""Wow, that was a really kind thing,"" or ""This song is amazing,"" and just feel it. Soak in the good feeling for a moment. You're manually creating a new pathway, telling your brain, ""Hey, this is important too. File this under 'Evidence of Goodness'.""

This isn't just wishful thinking. It's called neuroplasticity. Every time you pause to genuinely feel a positive moment, you're strengthening the neural pathways for optimism and calm, literally building a brain that's better at noticing the good. You're not just feeling better - you're physically rewiring your hardware.

I'm the first person who needs to do this. My own brain is convinced everything is evil half the time. But that's why we have to fight that default setting. It's a constant re-wiring.

The goal is not to silence your inner protector. It's to thank it for its input, and then make the conscious decision yourself.

Anyway, that's what I've been thinking about lately. If you've noticed this in your own life, you're definitely not alone.",5,1761261707.0,selfimprovement,2,0.78,False
1oeiddc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oeiddc,"UK Private hospital, overnight stay","I had elective surgery this week in a private hospital in the UK, and this is what I received…

Sourdough baguette with Brie and cranberry, salad and strawberry jelly for lunch (mid-afternoon once I was back in my room after the operation).  I was starving so this could have been cardboard and it would have been amazing.  It was genuinely lovely though.

Dinner : tomato pasta, garlic bread, Diet Coke.  This was alright, maybe a bit bland, sauce lacked flavour.  The jelly and ice cream that followed was a bit better, sometimes you just need a primary school pudding and this one delivered.  The biscuits were delicious.

Breakfast next morning : massive bowl of porridge with some berries, rack of wholemeal toast, pot of tea.  Appreciated getting the choice of sugar and salt for my porridge.  This was a damn good breakfast for a cold autumn morning.  They brought me a proper coffee later on as well, proper French Press coffee (no cheap instant here).

It was my first time staying overnight in a private hospital and I was really happy with the care I received and the quality of the food especially the proper coffee.  I’d give it a solid 8/10 overall.",22,1761261691.0,hospitalfood,2,0.97,False

1oei6un,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oei6un/dribbling_crimson_pt_1/,Dribbling Crimson Pt. 1,"Luminescent red and blue pulsed in the night. My patrol car was the first to arrive at the scene. A couple of nosy neighbors, draped in their nightwear, peered from the sidewalk. I drank in the scene; my heart took an erratic beat. 5 years as a sheriff’s deputy, and the most dangerous incident I’ve dealt with was abuelas having one too many at the church barbecue. Now, there was a potentially violent episode for me to deal with. A firm hand grabbed my shoulder.

“Hey, you in there?” my partner, Deputy Cassie Jacinto, said as she gave me a concerned look. Beats of red and blue lit across her face as another patrol car pulled into the street, showing her wavy black hair. It pressed against her pale skin, speckled with a few freckles.

I gave a reassuring pat on her arm as I pushed it away.

“Yeah, I’m good. Just not used to a call at 2 a.m., I think.” I stated, my eyes glued to the small white house. “Let’s get in there and find out if this is something we can take care of sooner rather than later, I haven’t seen Isabella awake in a couple of days.” I opened the car door and began to make my way to the small white house.

Jacinto and I answered the radio call about a potential domestic disturbance. A neighbor had reported screams originating from inside the house. The neighbors crowded Jacinto and me as we approached the front porch. Each of them clamored with questions.

“Everyone, please step back. This could be a potentially dangerous area.” I yelled out, waving a hand across the front of the crowd. Hopping out of their car, Deputy Jones and Deputy Jefferson approached. “Jefferson! Jones! Please keep these good people on the sidewalk,” I said as I stepped onto the cement stoop.

“Sure thing, Ramirez,” the deputies complied as they herded the distressed neighbors back towards the street. I gave Jacinto a nod, and she quickly stood at the ready on the other side of the door.

With a firm knock, I yelled towards the door, “Sheriff’s Department! Is everyone ok in there?” Waited a few seconds, but no reply was given. “This is Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Jacinto. We heard reports about someone screaming, we’re here to help! We're forcibly entering the premises if you do not answer in 15 seconds.” My breath went still, waiting for a reply. Each second getting closer, I feared worse and worse. I positioned my body to kick in the door, but Jacinto halted me with a raised hand.

“What are you doing!?” I asked, taken slightly aback. Jacinto nodded her head towards the neighbors and said with a hushed tone, “This isn’t a raid, man! Just try the door first, *Dios mío!*” She tried the door and let it slowly open. I shook my head to get my nerves right, resting my hand on my holstered revolver.

“Right, take point. I got your back.” Jacinto slowly stepped into the house, pulling out her flashlight. I followed suit, checking each angle she wasn’t covering. Specks of dust floated gently across our lights as we investigated. No signs of life in the living room. We made our way into the hallway when our noses took over the hunt.

A hint of smoke lingered in the air.

The scent grew stronger as we approached the bedroom door at the end of the hall. Taking positions on both sides of the door, I counted down from three before barging into the room with Jacinto behind.

“Freeze!” I yelled out into the shadowy bedroom. Jacinto and I were alone. Save for the corpse lying in the bed. It was singed; flesh melted to the sheets. Silence would have been a godsend with the unholy site, but the crackle and pop of burning flesh accompanied the scene. Burnt bubbles of pus and boiled blood decorated the body. Bits of the skull peeked through the scorched patches of hair. The arms and legs were crumpled inward, returning to a form that thirsted for hope, for a savior.

“Oh God…” escaped from Jacinto’s breath. As if on cue, the remains of an eyeball oozed through a bundle of thin, string-like flesh that was once a cheek. I ran to the nearest sink to expel whatever sat in my stomach.

I washed my mouth out and rinsed my vomit down the drain. Jacinto stepped into the kitchen and leaned against the kitchen counter. “I radioed Holly already, she’s gonna get some fellas up in San Juan to come down and do some forensics,” Jacinto said with a calm voice. The fidgeting of her pupils and her dead stare onto the floor indicated she was not.

“Right, holy shit.” I took off my hat to slick back my hair. “What the hell happened in there, Cassie?! Someone is melted to their goddamn sheets!” Cassie darted her eyes at me.

“Look, Ramón, I don’t know what the hell happened in this house but we gotta get our shit together! We’re deputies, and that means we need to handle this like professionals.” She glanced towards the front door. “We should tell Jefferson and Jones that they need to secure the crime scene, set up yellow tape, and all that. Hopefully they remember the procedures, not like they’ve had to use them before.”

I placed my hat back on my head, taking out my old bandana to wipe away the sweat from my brow. I stuffed the bandana back into my back pocket and said, “Yeah…sorry about that. Alright, I’m good. You know the protocol stuff better than I do. You go on outside and tell the guys what they need to do. I’m going to start casing the place and try to make sense of all this shit.” Jacinto gave me a quick nod and headed outside.

I proceeded with getting the lights on in the house, starting with the living room and kitchen. The living room was spotless. No clutter of mail or the usual house items on the coffee table. Multiple bookshelves lined the walls of the space. A garden of knowledge and ideas. It tugged at my heartstrings thinking about how someone’s interpretations and thoughts on all these works were just … gone. Another noticeable absence was that of a TV. Or lamps. Or any outlet for that matter.

Jotting that down, I turned my attention towards the bar. Above the bar window were pictures of the likely owner of the house. A woman of a small frame, likely late 20s, with black hair, brown eyes, dimple on the left cheek. Photos with and of family, friends, birthdays, and graduations. Something caught my interest as my eyes followed along the memories. There were two smoke alarms in the living room. Both completely brand new and expensive-looking.

I moved into the kitchen. Again, the area was spotless. Utensils were stored in containers and the counters still smelled of lemony cleaning products. I checked the trash to see if there was any identifying information. Piles upon piles of takeout bags filled the bin. Curiosity compelled me to the fridge. Inside were veggies, fruits, and sandwich makings. No raw meats, no leftovers, no soups.

An impulse possessed me. I rapidly went through her cabinets and pantry. No coffee maker, no toaster, her microwave and oven were spotless! There were no electric appliances of any kind. As I stared into the unblemished corner of a cabinet, that impulse urged my head to crane towards the ceiling. Two smoke alarms.

I marched out of the kitchen, into the hallway. On the ceiling, two smoke alarms. Jacinto entered back into the house.

“Ramirez, what you got—” I brushed past her as she queried. The smell of burnt skin and singed bone invaded my nostrils once more. Despite the gruesome display on the bed, my eyes were glued to the ceiling. Two smoke alarms.

Jacinto stepped into the room, covering her mouth and nose. “Ramirez?” she questioned.

I turned towards her, “I counted eight smoke alarms in this house so far, Jacinto. I’m willing to bet that if I stepped into the other bedroom, there would be two more. And I bet, if I went to that bathroom across the hall, I would find another two!”

“Keep cool, Ramirez,” Jacinto said softly, raising her hands and peering up at the smoke alarms in the room.

“Jacinto! There are twelve fucking smoke alarms in this house, and not a single one went off?” I jabbed a finger towards the bed, “When there is a goddamn woman roasted on her bed!?”

Fear and desperation welled in my core. A pitiful soul clung on to the hope that this was a terrible dream.

Jacinto locked eyes with me, a frigid stare. “Ramirez, I get it. When I was in the city, some cases just seemed out of this world. Impossible even. But I learned, regardless of the case, you don’t get anywhere without the facts. So we just need to be patient until forensics gets here so we can start doing our jobs.”

I took a moment to collect myself, “When you’re right, you’re right.”

“Don’t worry, it’s Los Perdidos, right? We figure this out, and the town goes back to being the cozy little spot for church picnics and farmer’s markets. I’m sure this is just a one-time thing.”",2,1761261191.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

-------------

**PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR WDIS POSTS**

* Position-specific scoring rules (PPR, TE premium, 4 or 6 pt passing TD, etc.)
* Other league specific rules and details (league size, std/PPR, roster details, custom scoring, bonuses etc.)     
* This week's opponents of your players
* Entire roster if helpful

---------------------

**PLEASE TRY TO ANSWER SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS BEFORE POSTING YOUR OWN**

* When answering questions, please make sure to **sort by NEW!**

----------------

**WE HAVE A BOT THAT CAN REFERENCE THE BORIS CHEN RANKINGS AND GIVE YOU FEEDBACK**

To invoke the bot, comment anywhere in this sub in the following format:

!boristiers position [player, player, player...]

Where position is a standard position acronym (dst, flex, qb, rb, te, wr) and player, player, player... is a comma-separated list of players for that position. Here's some examples:

!boristiers flex [hunter henry, keenan allen, melvin gordon]   
!boristiers rb [matt breida, tevin coleman]  
!boristiers qb [lamar jackson]  

The bot will reply to your comment with a table of player ranks in the format of {tier}.{position_in_tier} for each of the applicable forms of scoring. If a player is not found / ranked, they'll be denoted as N/A.

----------------

**WHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

* Do **NOT** reply with only the player name. This just removes the other person from the index without them getting information. You are not helping.
* Explain why you would start that player.
* Remember most people know how to look up rankings. They come here for discussion, start a discussion!
* **Please respond directly to the OP or the Bot will not pick up your comment**

----------------
**individual WDIS threads posted after this point will be deleted in order to keep the subreddit clean. Post here instead! If everyone sorts by new, your questions should be answered.**

1oehyh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultsurvivors/comments/1oehyh3/very_stuck_because_of_how_the_uk_council_housing/,Very stuck because of how the uk council housing works,"This is an incredibly long one and i know most of you wont understand half of the things in here if you arent from the uk, this is a lot more of a vent than anything because there quite literally is just about nothing to be done unless i win the lottery tomorrow, as a lot of things in adult life turn out to be

Trigger warnings for CSA, domestic/emotional abuse, possibly animal abuse. 

Quite frankly I wouldnt read this if you are sensitive/ in a bad headspace because i am incredibly desensitised to this by now and may have missed things so please keep yourselves safe.

I won't go too in depth about it all but theres an active police investigation and just generally an incredibly stressful and straight up scary house situation for me right now (seriously, my hair is dropping out and turning grey, again, which for someone whos just gone 18 really tells you how bad it is).

Its been generally bad for as long as i can remember, according to my sister my mam hasnt always been that bad but ive only seen old recordings of her being normal, not something ive personally experienced. Probably the breaking point for me was her not just not defending me, but completely ignoring me and somewhat blaming me for my brother screaming down and charging my door after i said the reason i didnt want to ""rekindle our relationship"" is that he has literally spoken to me less than i have with a bus driver, rude? yes, but true, also doesnt warrant charging the door as a 25 year old man who is twice my size screaming how im worthless, do nothing, contribute nothing to this house and that i can ""get out of this fucking house"". Important context being the man literally molested me as a child so this is rather ironic coming from him. Especially since I had literally just finished an A level, had no job and still payed more towards food, gas, electric, cups and plates (which he breaks)

That is a very much milder version of what happened in total and there is much much more to it but im leaving that side up to the police to deal with and they have the full details and are the first people who told me to get out as soon as i could.

( but any help with what really happens so to speak when you report a past sexual assault would be very very very helpful because the police just gave me the ""it depends"")

He is supposedly moving out however it as taken literal months just to get her to consider kicking him out, even then she has a habit of inviting random men she barely knows to the house, they usually end up dangerous in some way or just generally dickheads that drain her of what little money she has, which she is more than happy to give to them but when i ask her to buy shopping in or just give me the money to do it for her you would think id asked to take a shit in her coffee.

She also genuinely thinks he has done nothing wrong because he is autistic and ""lacks impulse control"", that is genuinely what she said, directly to my face, completely monotone, maybe 20 minutes after finding out what he did, while i was still trying to breathe properly after crying so hard i was struggling to breathe.

Meanwhile him, somehow the victim here, was already laughing on with his friends over the phone.

He is quite possibly the most functional, low support needs autistic man i have ever met. And believe me i not only am autistic to the point i struggle a great deal to do a lot by myself and had to learn how to be independent in the slightest completely on my own but at college there are other students who genuinely have no impulse control because of either very high support needs autism or other disabilities, he is far from that.

Lack of impulse control does not make you molest your younger sibling, or the two girls who were also victims and for their privacy i will leave that there.

When i bring up reporting him to the police (she isnt aware that i already have an investigation going) she only cares that it would ruin HER life, genuinely what she has said more than once.

When it comes to asking for new clothes/bedding or just about anything, she does this thing where she wont buy me things i need (clothes, food, new bedding/furniture) even if i ask over and over but will buy things that are nice to have but could have gotten me actual useful things and then acts like im ungrateful.

I think at this point most of my clothes are second hand from my sister/dad, are old clothes that were oversized when i was younger when my dad was still able to work or is stuff the college has given me for free as part of my kit (cargo trousers, steel toes, hoodies etc) or stuff ive gotten from charity shops and had to alter myself to fit.

Problem comes, I have more than two pets, 3 cats and a dog, which yes to most people that is a lot but ive had most of them since i was in primary school so its not like i can just give them up. 

There isnt a single council house close enough for me to still have a job that allows more than two pets, and private renting within my price range doesnt allow pets at all.

I've looked and looked and there are zero temporary fostering/rescue in my area for this stuff, none of the council houses allow more than two of anything and I'm really just stuck.

Quitting college is a must at this point because i wont be able to get any benefits at all if i stay and considering the only job ive been able to get in the 3 years ive been looking is a 6 hour contract at greggs (i was desperate, it was originally 12 hours but i didnt say no because its the first time ive so much as had an interview and if you cant guess its a bit of a hurry to get money of my own).

Being in the middle of nowhere especially i wasnt about to say no to a job that i can walk to when the busses inevitably get cancelled or run an hour late.

I havent even started the job yet either since the photo of my passport (right to work) the manager took is ""blurry"" and now i have to try and reschedule a whole meeting thing just for them to take a photo of my passport because unlike every other thing that needs my passport i cant just send a picture. 

Both my dad and my sister live in their own 1 bed bungalows which they were only allowed because they are both physically disabled, its also the only reason they can afford them. I cant live with either of them because my sister already has two pets and my dads dog would not get on with a cat (she is a greyhound x, shreds any toy resembling a small animal, not ideal to live with cats). I have no other family and being honest none of my friends have any money or a house and i know for a fact none of their parents have the space for another person, never mind one that comes with four animals.

I've been sleeping on my dads couch where i can since the cats are safe with my mam since at the very least she takes care of them and the dog is fine to come with me but he's already had multiple warnings over having too many people there so its literally become a game of hiding from the council vans whenever they are parked outside, sneaking out of the back door to let the dog out so im not seen in the front garden, especially since there is someone moving next door so at any time during the day there are two or three vans. 

Its probably something that will be funny in five years time but as of right now its more stress than i can handle.

I have decent enough references because of my collage work experience so i can fall back on that but the plan origionally was to save up for a cheap 125cc and cbt (for non uk people that stands for compulsory basic training, which is a mini licence for bikes/scooters, not the other cbt) and do on call firefighting on top of a retail/food job-> whole time firefighting eventually but i just genuinely dont have a clue anymore, which very honestly is scary because out of my friends im the one people go to for these things.

I cant even set up a go fund me because any money i get from it would last a disgustingly small time due to rent costs and if i get too much i get wiped from the council housing list entirely.",1,1761260553.0,adultsurvivors,1,1.0,False

While I realize this isn’t the peak of espresso snobbery, with the convenience and price it is close enough. I’ve narrowed it down to a few units within my price range on other subreddits, but beans are another story.

For a superautomatic, you are apparently meant to avoid beans that are glossy/oily and instead choose medium-dark to light beans to avoid gumming up the works.

I have heard good things about LavAzza’s Super and Gran Crema beans, and I believe Costco carries them, so that’s a pretty major plus (if they’re relatively fresh anyhow). I’m certainly not opposed to buying larger bags to save money.

What about for decaf?

My health is not great, but no solid diagnosis to point to. I may have Crohn’s but still need to do my colonoscopy. May have high blood pressure. I cannot see a doctor at the moment so I’m asking here for ideas. I take ibuprofen and tylenol on occasion (I try to keep it to less than once a week). Some supplements like vitamin D since I know I’m low, and iron and magnesium maybe once a week to keep up. 

I’ve had this in the past at random, once or twice I did actually pass out or at least black out, happened once every few months or longer, so not super common. No relation to being dehydrated, standing up, stressed, hot, low blood sugar, etc.

It comes on fast with no warning, like getting hit in the head, I fall if I can’t catch myself (sometimes even then), I get extremely dizzy and my vision spins like when you’re really drunk or spin in circles. It takes me around 5-10 minutes to feel well enough to do stuff and 30-an hour for it to fully go away. I rarely pass out but feel like I’m on the verge of it. I might slur my speech or have trouble thinking. Seems to sometimes have correlation with headaches or migraines but not always.

It’s happening again but multiple times a day in a row. Started out of nowhere when I almost collapsed at work, then again a few hours later. Dizzy a couple times a day the next day but not as bad.

1oehvgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oehvgb/my_party_has_a_strange_way_of_obtaining_its/,"My party has a strange way of obtaining its donations. Lately, they have become even stranger. [Part 1]","It is no secret that most major parties receive illegal funds, either to stay afloat or simply to line their pockets. The favor that is then done for the donors is usually always the same.

For example, in parliamentary votes, they vote against phasing out coal, and in return, the coal producers pay abnormally large sums of money, which are then divided up within the party. The amounts paid for simply “not standing up” are beyond imagination; it would be impossible for me to comprehend them.

Of course, all this takes place behind closed doors, and the donors want to remain anonymous, which is why a bank transfer is unfortunately never an option.

That is why each party has different ways of handling these transfers.

We have a “cash service” – each member of parliament has one week in which they must collect the funds from a pre-arranged location – and it is important to follow certain rules, which vary from job to job.

These rules must never be discussed, under any circumstances.

If anyone in a high position within the party hears that the rules of the job have even been discussed, then you can be sure that the consequences will ruin your life or, in some cases, even end it.

I have seen many colleagues come and go—some left voluntarily after their first “money service,” while others broke or betrayed the rules and were kicked out as a result.

 After that, you had to endure numerous smear campaigns in the party-affiliated media.

Every now and then, people would disappear overnight, there would be no trace of them, and the party would come up with an excuse as to why a colleague was no longer coming to work.

For us low-ranking politicians, it was already clear what exactly was happening to our colleagues, but no one wanted to talk about it or address it.

Ultimately, we were and are interchangeable.

We are well paid to keep quiet, distribute votes, and bring new representatives into the fold.

Our pay is so high that we simply close both eyes and turn our backs on these cases. I mean, what other choice do you have in such a situation?

If you speak out against it, you will either be declared a corrupt asshole within the city and the state, or you will disappear from the scene.

In some cases, anonymous tips were sent to the local authorities by the other parties, and they then showed up in front of the party building.

Only Mr. K, our chairman, was ever interrogated. He never allowed anyone to talk to us—the risk was too high that someone would start talking.

Of course, nothing ever came of it—our party has money to burn, and money can buy you any distortion of the truth.

The cases of my missing colleagues range from unsolved disappearances—which, coincidentally, were closed a few years earlier—to suicides that were then dismissed in public as the result of burnout.

I kept quiet and turned a blind eye for 10 years, but it has all gotten so much worse.

In the period before my last “mission,” more and more colleagues either jumped ship or disappeared, more than usual.

The Jobs we had to do were always a little weird - sometimes these money missions could really creep you out but they have never been that much of an issue. So I couldn't comprehend why exactly so many of my co-workers quit or vanished recently.

The missions rarely differed. Drive to a building, pick up the package, and deliver it to a mail slot in the party headquarters. 

The only thing that ever changed were the rules you had to follow.

My close friend, whom I'll call Jason here, was assigned the week before me.

Jason was always a very loyal member of the party; he never questioned anything, worked hard, and you could say he bled our party colors.

He was an extrovert, the kind of person who would approach you on the street without any embarrassment and talk to you as if you had been friends for decades.

We met while studying politics, and he made it his mission early on to bring me out of my introverted bubble—I was, and still am, a very reserved person.

That didn't change after we graduated or after we joined the party. Jason only became quieter when he was no longer able to cope with the task of contraception.

When his son was born, this man turned into a completely different person. However, he never lost his social streak – he was particularly good at campaigning, he won over a lot of people for our mission within the party, and he also won over many voters.

Jason was the last person you would have thought could be broken by anything.

Two weeks ago, he was on “money duty,” and when he came out of the briefing room where he had received the rules, he was pale as a ghost.

When I asked him if everything was okay or if he had gone back to drinking after five years, he just remained silent and gave me a frightened look as he walked away.

That was the last time I saw Jason. 

He didn't come to work the next day, and his face was never seen inside the party building during the rest of the week.

That wasn't like him at all—Jason had never been late since he became a father. Sick leave was also a rarity for him; it always seemed to me that his job kept him healthy.

At the end of the week, we were called together by the party leader—usually we just briefly summarize the week and discuss plans for the coming week, but this time it was completely different.

Mr. K, an old, grim man, stepped out of his office. His glasses, which felt like they were 20 cm thick, caught the last rays of sunlight and shot them into the middle of the room.

His expression was as cold as ice – you always had the feeling that the room got 2 to 3 degrees Celsius colder when he stepped out of his office once a week.

He cleared his throat and informed us with his authoritative gaze and still emotionless voice that Jason and his family had moved away and we would now be filling his position.

He tried to deliver this news as if he cared even one percent—but he failed repeatedly.

You could always tell that his employees were just interchangeable numbers on a piece of paper to him.

His rough voice carried through the large building, and he mentioned casually, as if it were information that didn't deserve more than two words, that he would be looking for a replacement and expected us all to be in the office on Monday as usual.

Mr. K glanced around the room once more, turned around, crept into his office, and said goodbye to us with a loud slam of his door.

This news had to sink in first, and it took a really long time. It wasn't until I got home that I realized Jason had been removed by the party.

A tear rolled down my cheek, and I wondered what Jason had done wrong.

What rule had he broken? What exactly was his task this week? My head was at war with itself for a long time, and it proved extremely difficult to think clearly.

For some reason, after a while, Jason's wife, Maria, popped into my head.

I just had to call her; even if it was only to get confirmation on the moving theory, that would have been enough for me to at least tell my head that Jason was still on this earth.

I picked up the phone and called her, and after a short delay, she actually answered the phone.

“Maria? Maria? Are you there?”

“Why are you calling, Mike?”

""Why am I calling? Are you kidding me? What about Jason? Why isn't he coming to work anymore? Why am I hearing from my boss that you guys are moving out of nowhere? Maria, what the hell is going on with you guys?

She was silent for what felt like an eternity—at one point I thought the connection might have been broken, but then I heard a quiet sob.

""Mike, we're *moving*; just understand. We don't want to be here anymore; this place, no, this party is ruining our lives... has already ruined our lives. What do you think this is all about? Make sure you do the same and leave the country, and make sure you don't leave the party like Jason did.""

“What the hell are you talking about, what do you mean?”

“Goodbye, Mikey, don't ever call here again.”

I shouted her name a few more times into my phone, but unfortunately there was no answer on the other end. Maria didn't respond to any further calls. 

Jason's number no longer worked.

There was no voicemail, just an automated message from his phone provider informing me that the number was no longer in service.

Shock is a term I wouldn't use to describe this situation.

I couldn't even begin to describe how I felt—I sat motionless in my living room, and slowly my brain began to process the conversation with Jason's wife.

The phrases “ruined our lives” and “do as I do” ran through my head until I slowly came to a decision.

Jason had been eliminated, and Maria fled the country because she feared for her well-being.

I trembled as a new thought entered my mind—when is my next “money service”?

As if remote-controlled, I got up and moved toward my kitchen.

My calendar was on the dark dining table, and when I turned on the light in the room, I saw large red letters smiling at me on the row for the next week, letting me know that it was my turn to earn money.

It may have been paranoia, but I could have sworn that this entry in the calendar wasn't mine.

I never wrote with a red pen, especially not on my calendar, because the color bleeds through.

I also felt like I was being watched.

You probably know that feeling when someone is staring at you from a distance, so much so that it gives you goosebumps. Were those the first warning signs?

Maybe, but my mental overload did its best to prevent me from noticing these signals.

The weekend flew by. I didn't relax, and if someone had asked me what I had been doing, I probably wouldn't have been able to give an answer that was even remotely credible.

I hadn't been in the party building for a minute when I was summoned to the briefing room.

This room was a small chamber with a black armchair and a small coffee table in the middle, on which layed an envelope labeled “Rules.”

The air was thick and the atmosphere, even though I was the only one in the room, was tense. The letter and I engaged in a duel in which I was already destined to be the loser.

My hand trembled as it made its way to the envelope, and when I pulled it off the table with a jerky movement, I felt something in the back of my neck.

A cold breath, as if a corpse were standing behind me. Terror overwhelmed me and robbed me of the ability to move my legs. The breath on my neck came rhythmically and slowly spread through my entire body.

I had probably only been standing in that room for a minute, but time passed much more slowly for me.

I hadn't regained control of my body; my legs switched to autopilot and turned me toward the door against my will. There was nothing behind me—a loud sigh of relieve escaped my lungs and I slowly began to calm down.

“It's all in your head, it's all in your head.”

These words keept running through my mind. I hardly slept at all, so of course I was just imagining everything. Right?

As I grabbed the door handle, I felt that cold breath on my neck one last time, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something or someone was reaching for my shoulder. I lost my balance slightly and tilted to the left, the cold moved from my neck to my shoulder, and I felt as if I were freezing to death.

It all became too much for me, I pushed the door open and slammed it behind me, I sank slightly to my knees and was greeted by the questioning and judgmental looks of my colleagues. A few of them even giggled.

If I had been in my right mind, I would have grabbed them and locked them in the briefing room so they could experience for themselves what it was like in there, but I didn't. On the contrary, I forced myself to my feet, put on a fake, feigned laugh, and left my workplace.

The letter never made it out of the building; I threw that damn piece of trash in a garbage can. I don't care about any of it, let the party demonize me across the country. At that point, I didn't care about anything anymore. I'm not going back there. Why should I?

The thought of taking the whole thing to the press flashed through my mind and fought with the thought of simply leaving the country and starting a new life. Nothing is keeping me here anyway.

We plan to have dinner there, but would love to pre-game our fancy dinner or have a nightcap at a local dive/industry bar (extra points if there's a pool table!). Any recommendations for a good dive/a bar that bartenders love? 

Would also love any other Cazenovia recommendations (any good thrifting?). We plan to check out Critz Farms, maybe do some bowling, and just enjoy walking around the town, grabbing some coffee, and people watching. 

Thanks so much! ",2,1761260148.0,Syracuse,8,0.75,False

1oehsh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1oehsh0/are_marriages_really_like_this/,Are marriages really like this?,"It is a bit of a rant as it has been on my mind for sometime. So, while I was studying in us, I had a latina roommate who used to work part-time as a babysitter.

And she was working for this techie indian couple where both of them were working remote software jobs at home and needed a babysitter for some hours a day. Everything was good and fine but she felt that the husband was a paying her a little bit more attention then needed. And she decided to not keep on working there anymore.

Cut to a couple of weeks later the husband messages her asking her to meetup for a coffee and previously she had most of her communication with the wife, so this seemed a bit odd. She agrees to meetup and when they met, the husband offeres that he could help her with money and how great it is to talk to her and that they should countinue meeting up. After this she blocked his number and didn't work with any Indian couple during her entire studies.

I just found it baffling that this guy has a new baby, a wife and has an amazing job but still is trying to make moves. If this is the case how can you ever build trust in marriages and family? I mean you have a kid now and you are still not satisfied with what you have? Whenever I think about it, I just get super mad and sad and are marriages really like this?

Cause money spent on memories is money well spent
Son I don't know everything but I know one thing for sure
If you love her that much right now
You're only going to love her more so

Be the first to apologize even when you're right and say when you're wrong
Never pass up on the chance to slow down and dance to her favorite song
That diamond ring's worth every cent if you marry your best friend
Buy the flowers just because, fill her coffee cup and her tank of gas
And thank God for what you've got and don't ever stop trying to make her laugh
You want a love that will last you till the end
Marry your best friend

Marry the one who makes you see a better man in the mirror looking back
Marry the one you know you can't live without
That's the only way to make it last
