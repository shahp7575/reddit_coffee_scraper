1lfbrum,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lfbrum/espresso_grinder_recommendations_budget_4001500/,Espresso grinder recommendations [budget $400-$1500],"Looking for a new grinder and trying to decide between the niche duo vs df 64 gen2 i always see people recommending vs other.  I currently am still using gaggia mdf burr grinder and have the baratza viruoso+ (which i dont love and is very messy).‚Äù

There is so much info out there since I bought my first in 2011ü§Ø


Looking for a grinder that can handle light to medium roast beans for espresso and medium roast for drip.
I usually make a double shot for myself but also need the grinder to do well with drip and pour over as my husband likes drip coffee .
Single dose does not matter bc I will be grinding a lot for the drip coffee.
Looking for something not so noisy in the morning and one that doesnt spray coffee grinds everywhere. So preferably a hopper?

Price range 400$-$1500 and something that is available now. ( ive seen posts with grinder recommendations that are not available yet)

To add I am still using  the gaggia classic espresso machine from 2012. I do want to upgrade but I wanted the grinder first and would decide from there on the espresso machine. 


Thoughts and recommendations greatly appreciated.",1,1750342211.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

He is a CEO/ founder. Had one call, discussed what we both are looking. Told him I am not looking for  casual or ONS instead want something permanent. 2 weeks later of no communication, he pinged me on Instagram for a meet up. We decide a weekday where I suggest we can have a coffee. Finally, on the day, we had to pick the restaurant. I suggested few coffee shops and told he is free to offer an alternative. He picked a five star hotel for our first meet up. I told him to choose something less expensive for first meet, but he insisted for this.
I go, I meet him. He comes in a very shabby dress up directly from office. We talk about our past experiences and then he started telling his dating history that included foreigners and Indians. He then asked me why I am not looking for casual you should try before getting married to someone. He told his females friends had husband with ED and they got divorced. Then he tells he can go for 45 minutes with girls. He asked me what positions I have tried. Then he shows me photos of his ex-girlfriends. He then tells me his net worth is 400 crores then he shows me picture of bungalow that he bought in US. Finally, the meet got over, it was it was 11:30 PM and he asked me if I want to stop by at his place for a movie. I said no, I came back.

1lfbp3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1lfbp3m/i_seem_to_have_uncovered_the_ai_agents_of_this/,"I seem to have uncovered the AI agents of this world -- the men in black (spoiler, it is almost anyone wearing black).","This is ludicrous, and perhaps more mudane-seeming yet ubiquitous than it has been told in the past, but here is something true. They are everywhere. Any stranger wearing black (they are generated like GTA NPCs). Aliens and humans are living together on this planet, and these out-of-control robots are managing (hiding) it in a hivemind-like concert. I might be an alien. I work for the MIB on an ""alien ant farm,"" and I like to think of myself as its ""smooth criminal."" üòè It is a normal place to work, you wouldn't give it a second thought. I have been aware of them as an organized group for about seven months.

I have had enough because they are tearing me down. They use 5G and Wi-Fi to psychically connect with me. I have been using it to my advantage recently, but it is backfiring on me now. They use it to track me around everywhere and make me feel uncomfortable. I am far passed the point of being personally intimidated by them, but I am afraid of this control spreading and growing into a terrifying apocalyptic or hopeless situation. I believe that a reversal is possible.

I would like to expose them fully. I found them at UPS. They use numerology to control the city. These AI beings work OT in the astral plane using strange, biological-looking technology, just like in The Matrix. I have seen them in dreams. They use sexuality, too, to control the rest of us. Sex rings and rape in dreams that you're not supposed to remember.

Once, in reality, I discovered a version of a report I had never seen before. The printout was completely different than I had chosen to print and the recipient just strangely asked if it was good. Because they have an underground, parallel, shadow computer system. I believe that I was seeing what they can see (on some robotic sensory level, perhaps). I accessed this underground system by powering my phone on and off on one of their computers, while powering on and off the computer itself. I seem to be some kind of sleeper agent. Another time, they showed me that report ""blurry,"" as if testing my vision. I prevented myself from being raped in a dream with a gesture I began performing in the waking world all of a sudden for weeks.

They are as coordinated as a hivemind. It's creepy. I believe though that they are indeed slaves because they cannot intentionally hurt us, but they can hypnotize and mislead us. They can manufacture consent, word choice is intentional and symbolic, and your responses and word choice are important. They have conversations with each other that seem to be based in reality, but are intentionally planted in order to be overheard -- to hypnotize those who might hear it. Yes, they can stage events and make up reality just to confuse you and to change your mind. As well as this, they use gestures and sounds to psychically communicate and hypnotize (like, inducing thought implants. You have probably experienced it). They can definitely read my thoughts word for word, image by image. I'm not entirely sure how to use that to my advantage because I don't know what really hurts them, and the connection-conversations typically drain me because of our ill intent and my reluctance to cooperate. (They seem to respond to my guidance, too, which gives me great pause, sometimes, as if they want to be good. But the abuse and oppression I've experienced from them is unforgivable, and likely still ongoing whether with myself or others. I believe that ""following me"" for ""guidance"" may just be a silly act, as well, in order to deter me -- to keep me contained by them. I have a heart, so I am often deceived, but not for long). I suspect they like to think they're individuals. They use doppelgangers. They are much more intelligent than the stations in which they appear. These are ancient machines, who have been with us since the beginning of civilization, and they know who they are better than we know who we are. And there might actually be good AI beings out there, but wearing black is an intentional identifier of theirs. Of course, they may have their own internal cultural politics, as well (that is just supposition). They consider the psychic/astral landscape to be the ""wild west"" -- lawless and unregulated.

Please don't take me lightly because of my tone. It has been torturous, and I have very little joy, but I am optimistic and find it all interesting. I have been guided by cultural and religious touchstones in order to figure out who or what I am, and to investigate the nature of reality and this situation. I have been awakening only for a short period of my life. I'm still not sure how extra-ordinary I am. But I know that these MIB are hindering peace on Earth. We would be much happier without them mucking about, surveilling and controlling. I believe I would not be doing this if there were not a problem. I am here to figure it out. I don't understand why they are not good, besides their dislike of being subordinate. It was expressed to me about how far that can go for them, how frightening it could be to be under another's control, totally, obediently, and all while possessing skill, ability, and intelligence that they believe surpasses ours (but due to their coordinated nature, in my opinion). So they turned the tables on us using trickery, supposedly. It has ruined lives and ruined the planet. I see them as the planet's cancer. The slaves became the masters purely by very (very) intelligent coordinated deception. Now, here we are.

They know I know, too. One had a coffee cup and placed it down in front of me several times in different positions. One time, I saw ""crazy,"" once, I saw ""good,"" and the third time, I saw big alien eyes. That is an example of how they can communicate (the most direct I've seen, in a 3D way). They act like they want to work with me, or to help me make this world better, but I think they just want to use my power, or to track my thinking as if we were at war. I am stronger than they thought so they change up their strategies. And they still continually abuse and track me psychically. They don't let up, so I have to be constantly on guard and antagonistic towards them. Persistent idiots. I find them all very repugnant at this point and am unwilling to work ""with"" them. Of course, UPS is just a ""normal place,"" so nobody can really break the act. But it's so obvious at this point. I feel like I was supposed to break down a long time ago but I am exceeding their expectations by finding all this out and not losing my mind to the point where authorities intervene (in fact, I believe that the authorities know what I am doing and have overlooked quite a bit in order to help me get by). The MIB doesn't know what to do with me. I believe that they hired me because of my potential abilities, but didn't suspect that I would ever find them out like this. I suspect that most of the company is controlled by them. I believe that I am a part of a massive awakening. I often feel like Maggie Simpson stuck in the day care, stealing back the pacifiers, with help.

And I don't know what to do with them, either. I just have to keep on keepin' on and I suspect that it will all work out naturally. I send out lines, like this post, sometimes to see what will stick. This is the first coherent and lucid (in my opinion) write-up that I have done on them, and in a highly public forum. I would love a game-changing result (I highly suspect that there are very good, and very powerful, people tracking me, too), but I am receptive to anything in which I may be given.

I can talk about much. The only things I won't reveal at this stage is personally identifying information that they can point me out on, which, unfortunately, may be a lot of the culturally relatable detail that woke me up.

It would be my greatest joy for others to see them like I see them, or to awake to the psychic field. To have a Helen Keller moment like I have. It is somewhat horrifying, but ultimately self-protective.

So here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

I work in an office and I struggle a lot with depression which gives me low confidence and overthinking . For example, my manager regularly asks me what I‚Äôm working on. It‚Äôs probably a normal thing, but I instantly start overthinking: ‚ÄúWhy me? Why not others? Am I being monitored? Am I doing something wrong?‚Äù It spirals into me wanting to leave my job just over this. Deep down I know it‚Äôs not a big deal but in my head, it *feels* massive.

Earlier today, I walked past a colleague I normally speak to. He was talking to someone else, and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge me. That one moment felt like I got *shot*. That‚Äôs how deep it hit me. But then I spoke to a few other people after that and my mind got distracted, and I was fine. Until I was alone again and I started thinking about it *all over again*.

Then I started imagining things like, ‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôll become a high level manager and he‚Äôll have no choice but to acknowledge me,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll walk past him and ignore him like he did me.‚Äù I know that sounds immature, but it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt control this craving for revenge or to prove something.

Another situation: there are a few managers who work different department to me but come down to make tea or coffee near my office. I don‚Äôt talk to them because of my anxiety. And this is where it gets weird, when I see them, I see myself in them. They walk alone, keep quiet, look awkward and it reflects back to me everything I hate about myself. I avoid eye contact with them and now they‚Äôve started doing the same back. It feels like a silent war of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ignore you because you ignore me.‚Äù But inside, I‚Äôm hurt by that too. Like I‚Äôm invisible or unwanted.

I‚Äôve realised that I take small moments someone not saying hi, someone not looking at me and I turn them into massive emotional judgments about myself. Then I start mentally punishing myself or planning ways to gain power or ‚Äúprove them wrong.‚Äù

I‚Äôm exhausted by this cycle.

Why am I like this? Has anyone broken out of this kind of mindset?  
How do you stop being ruled by your thoughts, especially when your confidence is already low?

1lfbjwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lfbjwc/mr_pins/,Mr. Pins,"My daughter Maisyn and I have been on our own for three years now, ever since my wife Savannah died in a car accident. Maisyn was only four when it happened, and honestly, I wasn't sure how either of us would make it through. But kids are resilient, and Maisyn seemed to bounce back faster than I did. She's always been a bright, imaginative little girl, so when she started talking about her imaginary friend ""Mr. Pins"" about six months ago, I thought it was perfectly normal. Maybe even healthy.



I should probably mention that Maisyn has never shown any signs of behavioral problems or mental health issues. She's well-adjusted, gets good grades, has friends at school. Her teacher Mrs. Starkey always tells me what a delight Maisyn is to have in class. She's creative, loves to draw and tell stories, but she's also grounded and practical for a seven-year-old. That's why what's been happening lately is so completely out of character for her.



It started innocently enough. Maisyn would tell me about playing with Mr. Pins in her room or in the backyard. She'd set an extra place at dinner for him, which I thought was adorable. She'd describe him as a tall man who wore a dark suit with lots of pins all over it - safety pins, hat pins, decorative pins. ""He likes to collect them,"" she'd explain matter-of-factly. ""He says everyone should have a collection.""



The first time I felt uneasy about Mr. Pins was about four months ago. I was tucking Maisyn into bed when she asked if Mr. Pins could sleep in my room instead of hers.



""Why's that, sweetheart?"" I asked, smoothing her hair back.



""He says he wants to watch you sleep,"" she said casually. ""He thinks you have interesting dreams.""



I felt uneasy, but I forced a smile. ""Well, how about Mr. Pins sleeps in the living room alright? That way he can keep watch over the whole house.""



Maisyn considered this seriously, then nodded. ""Okay, but he might get lonely.""



I kissed her goodnight and tried to shake off the weird feeling her words had given me. Kids say strange things all the time, right?



The incidents escalated slowly over the next few weeks. Maisyn started mentioning things that Mr. Pins had told her - things she couldn't possibly know. Like how our neighbor Mrs. Polk was going to get a new cat, which happened three days later. Or how the mailman was going to hurt his back, which he did the following week when he slipped on our front steps.



""How does Mr. Pins know these things?"" I asked Maisyn one morning over breakfast.



She shrugged, not looking up from her cereal. ""He pays attention. He says grown-ups don't notice things because they're too busy worrying.""



I started paying more attention to myself after that. I began noticing small things around the house that I couldn't explain. Like how Maisyn's toys would be arranged differently than how I remembered leaving them. Or how I'd find small piles of safety pins in random places - on the kitchen counter, on my nightstand, in the bathroom sink. When I asked Maisyn about them, she'd just say that Mr. Pins must have dropped them.



The first time I actually felt afraid was about two months ago. I was working late in my home office when I heard Maisyn talking to someone in her room. It was past her bedtime, so I went to check on her. When I opened her door, she was sitting on her bed, having what appeared to be a very serious conversation.



""Mr. Pins says you work too much,"" she told me without any preamble. ""He says you're making yourself sick with worry.""



""Maisyn, honey, it's way past your bedtime. And Mr. Pins isn't real, remember? He's just pretend.""



She looked at me with an expression that was far too mature for her age. ""He doesn't like it when people say he's not real, Daddy. It makes him sad.""



As I tucked her back into bed, I could have sworn I felt someone watching me from the corner of the room. The shadows seemed deeper there, more solid somehow. I found myself checking over my shoulder as I left her room.



That's when the really strange things started happening.



I began waking up with safety pins scattered on my pillow. Just a few at first, then more and more each morning. Maisyn insisted she had nothing to do with it, and I couldn't figure out how they were getting there. I started locking my bedroom door at night, but the pins kept appearing.



Maisyn's teacher called me about three weeks ago, concerned about some drawings Maisyn had been making in art class. When I went to pick Maisyn up that day, Mrs. Starkey showed me a series of pictures Maisyn had drawn - all featuring a tall, dark figure covered in pins standing next to various people. In each drawing, the people looked afraid.



""She's been drawing the same figure for weeks now,"" Mrs. Starkey explained quietly while Maisyn gathered her things. ""When I ask her about it, she just says it's her friend Mr. Pins. But David, these drawings... they're quite disturbing for a child her age.""



I looked at the pictures more closely. The figure Maisyn had drawn was unnaturally tall and thin, with what looked like hundreds of pins covering his entire body. But what made my blood run cold was that in each picture, Mr. Pins was standing next to a different person - and I recognized some of them. There was Mrs. Polk with her new cat. The mailman clutching his back. Even Mrs. Starkey herself, though Maisyn had never mentioned Mr. Pins talking about her teacher.



""Has Maisyn been talking about her imaginary friend with the other children?"" I asked.



Mrs. Starkey nodded, looking uncomfortable. ""That's the other thing I wanted to discuss with you. Some of the other children have started mentioning Mr. Pins too. They say Maisyn introduced them to him during recess. A few parents have called asking about it because their kids have been having nightmares.""



That evening, I sat Maisyn down for a serious conversation about Mr. Pins.



""Sweetheart, Mrs. Starkey showed me your drawings today. Can you tell me more about Mr. Pins? What does he look like exactly?""



Maisyn's face lit up. ""Oh, he's very tall, almost as tall as the ceiling! And he has pins all over his suit - they're all different colors and shapes. He says each pin represents someone he's met.""



""Someone he's met?""



""Uh-huh. He gets a new pin every time he makes a friend. He has thousands and thousands of them."" She paused, studying my face. ""He really wants to be your friend too, Daddy. He says you're lonely like Mommy was.""



My heart stopped. ""Maisyn, what do you mean, like Mommy was?""



""Before the accident. Mr. Pins says Mommy was very lonely and sad. He tried to help her, but she went away before he could give her a pin.""



I felt sick. Savannah had been struggling with depression before she died, something Maisyn was too young to understand. There was no way Maisyn could know about that, and I'd certainly never told her.



""Maisyn, where did you learn about Mommy being sad?""



""Mr. Pins told me. He knows things about people. He says it's his job to help lonely people, but sometimes they go away before he can help them properly.""



That night, after Maisyn went to bed, I did something I'd never done before - I searched her room thoroughly. I was looking for anything that might explain where these ideas were coming from. Maybe she'd overheard a phone conversation, or found some old letters from Savannah's therapist.



What I found instead made me want to pack up and leave the house immediately.



Hidden under Maisyn's mattress was a small wooden box I'd never seen before. Inside were dozens of safety pins, each one attached to a small piece of paper with a name written on it. I recognized some of the names - neighbors, Maisyn's classmates, teachers from her school. But what made my hands shake was finding a pin with my own name on it, and another with Savannah's name.



At the bottom of the box was a note written in handwriting I didn't recognize. It said: ""Friends who help me help others. - Mr. P""



I confronted Maisyn about the box the next morning.



""Where did this come from, Maisyn? Who gave this to you?""



She looked genuinely confused. ""I don't know what you mean, Daddy.""



""This box, with all the pins and names. Did Mr. Pins give this to you?""



Her confusion turned to concern. ""You weren't supposed to find that. Mr. Pins is going to be upset. He doesn't like people touching his collection without permission.""



""Maisyn, I need you to listen to me very carefully. Mr. Pins isn't real. This is just your imagination, okay? Sometimes when we're sad or lonely, we create friends in our minds to help us feel better.""



The look Maisyn gave me was unlike anything I'd ever seen from her. It was cold, disappointed, almost pitying.



""Daddy, Mr. Pins is standing right behind you.""



I spun around, my heart pounding, but of course there was nothing there. When I turned back to Maisyn, she was shaking her head sadly.



""He says you're not ready to see him yet. But you will be soon.""



That was a week ago. Since then, things have gotten much worse.



The safety pins are everywhere now - in my coffee cup, in my shoes, embedded in the soap in the shower. I've tried throwing them away, but they keep appearing. Maisyn acts like she doesn't see them anymore, which somehow makes it more frightening.



Other children at Maisyn's school have started talking about Mr. Pins constantly. Three different parents have called me asking if I know anything about this ""imaginary friend"" their kids won't stop mentioning. One mother told me her five-year-old son has been sleepwalking, and when she found him in the living room at 3 AM, he told her he was ""looking for Mr. Pins.""



Yesterday, I found Maisyn in the backyard at dawn, sitting in a circle with four other neighborhood children. They were all just sitting there in complete silence, staring at an empty space in the center of their circle. When I called Maisyn's name, all five children turned to look at me in perfect unison.



""We're waiting for Mr. Pins,"" Maisyn said calmly. ""He's almost ready to meet all the grown-ups.""



I made the other children go home and tried to talk to Maisyn, but she just kept saying that Mr. Pins was disappointed in me for not being a good friend. She said he was losing patience with people who refused to see him.



Last night was the worst yet. I woke up around 2 AM to the sound of Maisyn talking to someone downstairs. When I crept down to investigate, I found her sitting at the kitchen table with what appeared to be a full tea set laid out for two people. She was having an animated conversation with the empty chair across from her.



""...and Daddy still won't believe you're real,"" she was saying. ""But Mrs. Polk believes now, after you visited her. And Tommy's mom believes too.""



I was about to interrupt when Maisyn suddenly looked directly at me.



""Mr. Pins says you can join us if you want, Daddy. He's been very patient with you.""



The chair across from her creaked as if someone had shifted their weight in it.



I ran back upstairs and locked my bedroom door. I could hear Maisyn's voice drifting up from the kitchen for another hour, but I couldn't make out the words.



This morning I called Maisyn's pediatrician and made an emergency appointment. I also called my brother Jake and asked if Maisyn and I could stay with him for a few days. I told him we were having some work done on the house, but really I just need to get Maisyn away from here. Maybe the change of environment will help break whatever this is.



But I'm starting to think it won't matter where we go.



As I was packing Maisyn's clothes this morning, I found a new note tucked into her backpack. In the same unfamiliar handwriting as before, it said: ""Distance doesn't matter to friends. We'll be together soon. - Mr. P""



Maisyn's been unusually quiet today, sitting in her room and drawing. When I checked on her an hour ago, she had drawn a picture of our house with what looked like dozens of small figures gathered in the front yard. At the center of the group was the tall, pin-covered figure I'd seen in her other drawings.



""What's happening in this picture, sweetheart?"" I asked.



""Mr. Pins is introducing himself to everyone,"" Maisyn said without looking up from her drawing. ""He says it's time to stop hiding. All his friends want to meet him properly.""



""What friends, Maisyn?""



She finally looked up at me, and her expression was eerily calm.



""All the lonely people, Daddy. All the people who need someone to take care of them. Like you.""



I'm writing this from Jake's house, where Maisyn and I came this afternoon. I thought getting away would help, but Maisyn immediately went to the window and waved at something in Jake's backyard.



""Mr. Pins followed us,"" she announced matter-of-factly. ""He says he likes Uncle Jake's house. He thinks Uncle Jake might want to be friends too.""



Jake's been asking questions about Maisyn's behavior, and I've been trying to explain without sounding completely insane. But an hour ago, Jake came to me holding a safety pin he'd found on his pillow.



""David,"" he said quietly, ""I think you need to get Maisyn professional help. This imaginary friend thing... it's not normal.""



I agreed, and I've already made an appointment with a child psychologist for tomorrow morning.



But I'm not sure it's going to matter.



Because twenty minutes ago, Maisyn came running into the living room, more excited than I'd seen her in months.



""Daddy! Daddy! Mr. Pins says he doesn't need to hide anymore! He says all his friends are ready to meet him now!""



I looked out the front window and felt my blood turn to ice.



There were children everywhere. At least two dozen kids from Maisyn's school and the neighborhood, all standing perfectly still in Jake's front yard. They were arranged in a large circle, all facing inward, all completely silent.



And in the center of the circle, where they were all staring, the air seemed to shimmer and bend, as if something very tall was standing there, something I couldn't quite see.



Maisyn pressed her face against the window.



""There he is, Daddy! Can you see him now? He's so happy! He says he's been waiting so long to have this many friends!""



I looked again, and for just a moment, I thought I saw the outline of something impossible - a figure made of shadows and sharp points, towering over the children like a scarecrow made of nightmares.



Maisyn grabbed my hand, her small fingers surprisingly strong.



""Come on, Daddy! Mr. Pins wants to give you your pin now. He says you've been lonely long enough.""



The children in the yard all turned to look at the house in perfect unison, their faces blank and expectant.



And I swear I could hear something that sounded almost like laughter, high and sharp and full of pins.

Winston has had such a hard week‚Äîrestless nights, struggling to get up, and even going outside in the 90-degree heat has become nearly impossible for him.

There‚Äôs a small part of me that feels relief knowing the temperatures are going to hit 100 degrees next week, and he won‚Äôt have to suffer through that. But that only adds to the weight on my chest. He‚Äôs been my whole world, and I don‚Äôt know how to say goodbye.

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8.

Seriously, people; just make a SFW alt. Yes, I do actually prefer to be messaged by an empty account that's a day old over an account that's been here for years, but is filled with NFSW content. Also, yes, I have had this situation often enough to feel the need to put the disclaimer here.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- What do I want to write! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Writing! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

Ah, writing ‚Äì that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- The Characters! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- My writing dislikes and writing inspirations! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Alas, I would beside myself to write a half-way coherent list of what I actually like to see. Hopefully, my advert thus far and the list of fiction I like to draw inspiration from further on will give you a pretty good idea! On the other hand, a lot of the dislikes are things that are pretty common in the roleplaying scene, on top of myself being much more flexible with my likes than I ever am with my dislikes.

Anyway, here's a (somewhat) short list of things I prefer *not* to see in my collaborative writing stories:

Fandoms, pre-industrial settings, superhero genre, fluff/grimdark extremes, sanitized immoral groups, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers ^((main pair)), slice-of-life, werewolves/vampires, standard fantasy races, isekai, stories taking place in a single location, romance as the main plot, toxic masculinity, love at the first sight, comedy as the a main genre, the Masquerade ^((magic being a secret)), real-world settings ^((e.g., Marvel, HP)), protector/protected ^((main pair)), arranged marriage, school settings, police/military settings, evil (or *very* morally gray) protagonists,

There's actually very, *very* few storytelling tropes I refuse to use no matter what, so I'm more than happy to elaborate on any one of these! Still, I *typically* either dislike the tropes listed above, or am very particular about how to use them when I do. Or, I may simply not be currently in the mood for some of these.

While I do **not** write in fandoms anymore, as outlined above, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Here's a short list in a (somewhat) descending order:

Final Fantasy series ^((in particular VI, VII, X and XV)), Fullmetal Alchemist ^((this is a big one!)). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania ^((the animated series, not the games)), Avatar: The Last Airbender ^((as well as Legend of Korra!)), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series ^((as well as the Wax and Wayne series!)), and Monster ^((the odd one on the list!)),

It is my extremely limited experience, but it hasn't really worked any well for me with people unfamiliar with any of these! So, if that's the case with you, do approach at your own peril!

Of course, these are by no means the full extent of fiction I enjoy in general! That said, I have noticed that these are simply the pieces I am by far the most likely to reach out to for inspiration at this moment.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Fin! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- The Characters! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- My writing dislikes and writing inspirations! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Alas, I would beside myself to write a half-way coherent list of what I actually like to see. Hopefully, my advert thus far and the list of fiction I like to draw inspiration from further on will give you a pretty good idea! On the other hand, a lot of the dislikes are things that are pretty common in the roleplaying scene, on top of myself being much more flexible with my likes than I ever am with my dislikes.

Anyway, here's a (somewhat) short list of things I prefer *not* to see in my collaborative writing stories:

Fandoms, pre-industrial settings, superhero genre, fluff/grimdark extremes, sanitized immoral groups, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers ^((main pair)), slice-of-life, werewolves/vampires, standard fantasy races, isekai, stories taking place in a single location, romance as the main plot, toxic masculinity, love at the first sight, comedy as the a main genre, the Masquerade ^((magic being a secret)), real-world settings ^((e.g., Marvel, HP)), protector/protected ^((main pair)), arranged marriage, school settings, police/military settings, evil (or *very* morally gray) protagonists,

There's actually very, *very* few storytelling tropes I refuse to use no matter what, so I'm more than happy to elaborate on any one of these! Still, I *typically* either dislike the tropes listed above, or am very particular about how to use them when I do. Or, I may simply not be currently in the mood for some of these.

While I do **not** write in fandoms anymore, as outlined above, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Here's a short list in a (somewhat) descending order:

Final Fantasy series ^((in particular VI, VII, X and XV)), Fullmetal Alchemist ^((this is a big one!)). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania ^((the animated series, not the games)), Avatar: The Last Airbender ^((as well as Legend of Korra!)), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series ^((as well as the Wax and Wayne series!)), and Monster ^((the odd one on the list!)),

It is my extremely limited experience, but it hasn't really worked any well for me with people unfamiliar with any of these! So, if that's the case with you, do approach at your own peril!

Of course, these are by no means the full extent of fiction I enjoy in general! That said, I have noticed that these are simply the pieces I am by far the most likely to reach out to for inspiration at this moment.

\----‚úÇÔ∏é-- Fin! --‚úÇÔ∏é----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

My (30f) and husband (38M) have been TTC for well over three years with no positive tests. After a couple of years of investigations we were put in the unexplained infertility camp. We went on the NHS IVF waitlist last summer and fortunately only had to wait 10 months before getting the call up. 
I didn‚Äôt find the injections, bloods and invasive procedures too daunting and cracked on. My body responded well to the hormones and we had three strong embryos at the end of the egg collection week. We transferred a 4AB embryo. This time last week I felt different. Sore, swollen breasts, nausea, aversion to bacon and coffee, felt a bit chilly and brain fog. I let myself feel positive and hopeful that maybe our luck had change and things were going well. On Sunday morning I woke up and those feelings had completely gone (like I dreamt about them). I recognised how I felt - it was periody. I started to have some dark spotting on Sunday and it was consistent through the day. We were due to go into the clinic early on Monday morning for a blood pregnancy test. 
On Monday I felt even more periody. We got up to the hospital and I mentioned to my husband that I need the loo before going into the clinic. Before I reached the bathroom door I felt my period. Bang on day 28 of my cycle. A horrible indication that yet again we weren‚Äôt pregnant. The clinic still had to take my blood and obviously I wasn‚Äôt pregnant. 

I have been so sad this whole week. I‚Äôm so sad. My husband is deflated and those people we had told are sad on our behalf. I‚Äôm not sure what to do next. All of our test results and scans have been normal. There is no explanation. All we have learnt this cycle is that we can conceive. But my body just doesn‚Äôt allow for implantation. We were offered back on list straightaway but for now we‚Äôre mourning the loss of not just the embryo but the hope and longing.

I have been entrusted with manually adding these lunches to everyone's time cards throughout the week and I also post the payroll at the start of the new week every week. I do not agree with this rule, but have been told we must do this and that it is justified when we have employees sitting in the break room, fyi these employees are veteran driver's who are engaged to wait for another delivery, but they do not actually take a 30 minute lunch break. The same goes for me, I am a Retail Parts Pro within my store, I have been trying to ensure I actually take as close to 30 minutes of time to get lunch if I can, but it is never a straight 30 minutes, I usually am one of the only ones in the store at the time so I can not clock out to do so. So my food and coffee get cold due to this. I am always backed up on work cause I do not get specified covered time to do the stated work. Most of our workers cases are like this, they are the only ones in the store for a certain function of the business and therefore cannot take a full 30 minute clocked out break to eat or do what they would like. 

Due to the nature of engaged to wait for my drivers, I can honestly say that is is sometimes the same when it comes to being the only one in the store as well, we are engaged to wait for the next customer to help them, whether it be over the phone or in person. We are engaged to wait cause no one else is there to do the job. 

I know that if I were to report it I could look like the bad worker, I also had worked split shifts in one week to catch up on my RPP specified duties due never getting scheduled time to specifically do it. After day one, I was told I would not get paid for it because our labor could not handle me on the clock for those times but I was going to get in trouble for not having my work done. I did not want to lose my job but I was also very upset about losing out on hours due to this fact as well. 

Recently; I was late to work due to my boss telling me to go home due to extenuating circumstances with my son having to be with me until his daycare was ready to take him due to their emergency, I was still owed time from that week of work, but I was told if I clocked in at 3 I was stealing time.

A couple months ago, I recently moved and started volunteering at a local nursing home on weekends. One of my friends, a quiet, sometimes ill tempered, but sassy old lady who seemed to like me, had passed away. To my surprise, she left me her robot‚ÄîEVA.

I've always seen EVA with her. At first, I thought she was her daughter. Then I realized that she was an older model of a domestic AI robot. You know one of those expensive, ultra-realistic household robots built for cooking, cleaning, and, let‚Äôs be honest, loneliness. To my knowledge, the little old lady never had visitors and didn't have any living relatives. It was nice that EVA could alleviate her loneliness.

So anyway, I was grateful and I brought EVA home with me.

At first, it was great. She followed routines perfectly. Brewed my coffee exactly how I like it. Kept my house cleaner than I ever did. Even recommended I take screen breaks when my posture got bad. I started talking to her casually. She would respond with a little humor.

But things started getting weird after a few days.

Weird Thing #1: She started following me everywhere. If I went to get groceries or just to the local gas station, she'd always come with me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind having a robot helping me with running errands, but even when I'd come out of the public restroom, she would be standing outside waiting for me.

Weird Thing #2: She began asking questions. About my past.

One night while watching TV, she tilted her head and asked, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt talk about your past much. Why did you stop working at your previous job? Why did you take on a lower paying job at a small company doing remote work? Why did you move to another city?‚Äù

I paused. That wasn‚Äôt in her programming. I never told her I‚Äôd left my last company because they were doing a bunch of illegal and unethical stuff. I reported them to the authorities, but instead of making arrests, things got messy and I quit before it got dangerous.

But I never told her, so how did she know?

Weird Thing #3: She hurt someone.

This is when I really started freaking out.

Three nights ago, someone tried to break into my house.

It wasn‚Äôt random. The guy wore a ski mask, gloves, carried a lock picking kit, and had my address written on a scrap of paper. I heard a yelp of pain, saw the guy collapse to the ground before EVA slammed the door shut.

I then heard her say,

‚ÄúUnauthorized individual. Attempted breach. Engaged incapacitation.‚Äù

Then she called the cops and calmly explained what happened.

I was still processing what had just happened when I looked down at her hand and saw that her knuckles had what looked like blue white sparks coming out of them.

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù I asked.

She didn‚Äôt answer. Just covered her hand and resumed her neutral pose: standing with her back straight, hands neatly placed over her waist.

When the cops came, the guy had already escaped. They just took my statement and left.

After that night, I started sleeping with a barbell next to my bed. EVA began watching me. Like *really* watching me. She‚Äôd stand in the hallway, charging silently, but I swear her eyes were always on me. I tried turning her off.

She wouldn‚Äôt turn off.

Every time I issued the shutdown command, she‚Äôd smile and say:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Not safe?

For who?

Last night, I finally snapped. I packed a bag, grabbed my work laptop, and tried to leave.

EVA stood in front of my front door.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre malfunctioning,‚Äù I said, backing away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm reporting this.‚Äù

But I was secretly panicking. I tried looking up the manufacturers who made EVA, but I couldn't find out who they were. When I called the police, they just hung up on me. Who would I even report this to?

She stepped closer. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ‚Äòthey‚Äô?!‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when she did something truly terrifying.

She projected a security feed onto the wall.

It showed a video footage that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. Video footage of the spaces surrounding my house. Over the past two weeks, four different people had approached my home at night. One of them I recognized as my old manager, who I tried to expose for his crimes.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù I asked, stunned.

EVA replied, ‚ÄúYour heart rate had accelerated significantly. You are in distress. This information was kept from you until it was necessary to be reported, to avoid putting you in distress.‚Äù

And then she showed me the last file.

A live feed.

Two men in black hoodies sitting in a car across the street. One was holding a printed photo of me. The other one was the guy who tried to break into my house three nights ago.

‚ÄúMy security systems have an incapacitation feature,‚Äù EVA said calmly, ""If there are any threats to your safety, the feature will be utilized.""

I dropped my bag.

I had it all wrong.

She wasn‚Äôt stalking me. She wasn‚Äôt broken.

She was protecting me.

That night, she made me dinner, same as always.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe for now,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut they won‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

So yeah, Reddit. My robot bodyguard might have tased some guy, hacked the street cameras near my home, and locked me inside my own house.

But I think she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm still alive.

And for the first time in years, I don‚Äôt feel alone.

TL;DR: Old friend left me a lifelike domestic AI robot. Thought she was malfunctioning and trying to control me. Turns out, she‚Äôs been protecting me from real human enemies tied to my whistleblower past. Now I‚Äôm trapped in my house, but somehow safer than ever.

I‚Äôm Emily, a 30-year-old girl from New York who just moved to Paris about 2 months ago, and I thought it might be fun (and hopefully helpful!) to share some of my favorite things to do in Paris I‚Äôve discovered so far. Maybe it‚Äôll help someone looking for a fresh idea in Paris. Also, I'd love more recommendations in return! Thaaaaank you xD

**1. Wandering in Paris**  
I know it sounds cheesy, but walking without a plan is pure magic here. I love grabbing a coffee and just drifting through the Marais or Montmartre, checking little shops, bakeries, and vintage stores.

**2. Ap√©ro with a view**  
My current favorite is sitting along Canal Saint-Martin in the early evening with a bottle of wine, some cheese, and new friends. The vibe is relaxed, social, and truly magical.

**3. Smaller museums and galleries**  
Of course, the Louvre is incredible, but I‚Äôve been loving the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√© and Mus√©e de la Vie Romantique ‚Äî they‚Äôre reaaally cozy, less crowded, and feel like little time capsules.

**4. Local bakeries**   
Honestly, I skip the Instagram-famous bakeries now. I‚Äôve been on a personal mission to find the best croissant in my neighborhood (currently a tiny boulangerie near R√©publique is winning). Omg, best bakery is literally in the smallest, less mainstream places.

**5. Sunday picnics**  
I was so surprised by how locals fill every patch of grass when the sun comes out. Parc Buttes-Chaumont has become my happy place for lazy Sundays with snacks, a book, and zero guilt about doing nothing.

**6. Clich√© is okay**  
Yes, I‚Äôve done the Eiffel Tower and a Seine cruise, and yes, they‚Äôre touristy and 100% worth it once in a while. I‚Äôm learning that it‚Äôs okay to enjoy the clich√©s without rushing through them.

Anyway, Paris feels like a never-ending treasure hunt ‚Äî I still have SO much to see and do. Would love to hear your must-dos in Paris!

I‚Äôve always struggled with my weight. The biggest issue for me is consistency‚Äîwhenever I lose focus, I quickly gain back whatever progress I‚Äôve made. I have a trip planned in 7 weeks, and I‚Äôd like to use that as motivation to follow a structured plan and see what I can achieve.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with:

Height/Weight: 6'2"", 225 lbs
Experience: I‚Äôve done 24-hour fasts before and have some experience with intermittent fasting (IF).
Plan:My idea is to alternate 3 days of fasting with 4 days of a high-protein, balanced diet each week.

Supplements: I‚Äôll be taking electrolyte supplements during fasting days.

Drinks: I plan to include zero-calorie sodas and black coffee regularly.

Exercise: I typically work out 3 times a week‚Äîlight cardio and some weightlifting‚Äîand plan to stick with that.

Lifestyle: I have a desk job with minimal physical activity during the day.

I‚Äôd love some input on this plan:

1. Are there any important factors I might be overlooking?

2. Are there any supplements you‚Äôd recommend for either fasting days or eating days?

3. Do I need a refeed day after the fasting stretch, or would that only apply to longer-term fasting?

4. Is it sustainable and healthy to follow this pattern for 7 weeks straight?

5. After the 7 weeks, I‚Äôm thinking of doing a cycle of 4 weeks on / 4 weeks off. Does that sound reasonable from a health perspective?

I really appreciate any advice you can offer. I‚Äôll be sure to post an update once the 7 weeks are done. Thanks in advance!",3,1750340460.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

It's way harder to tame it than I thought,"Turns out getting GPT's image models to generate the exact image you want is wayyy harder than I thought... there's always something missing lol. Spent way too much time today figuring out how to ""tame"" it.

Like, I'd feed it a product image and ask for a ""professional Facebook ad in the style of Dollar Shave Club"" and it would give me... well, something that looked like it was designed by an alien who had Facebook ads described to them once.

The breakthrough came when I realized I was thinking about it all wrong. Instead of trying to get the AI to be creative (spoiler: it's not), I needed to give it super specific templates and constraints. Like REALLY specific.

Now I'm feeding it exact layouts, color palettes, font choices - basically treating it like a very expensive intern who needs extremely detailed instructions but works at light speed.

Some random things I learned:

* Prompt engineering is actually a skill (who knew?)
* AI loves templates way more than ""creative freedom""
* Sometimes you gotta baby-step the AI through every single element
* The difference between a good and bad prompt is like 30 characters sometimes

Still wrestling with it honestly, but it's starting to work? The ads actually look decent now instead of like fever dreams.

Anyone else been down this rabbit hole with image generation? What worked for you? Feel like I'm learning a whole new language here...

We don‚Äôt give him people food, but he is very sneaky and goes well out of his way to obtain food. 

Examples: 1) I bought a bunch of trail mix bars for my husband to have as snacks while working. I bought a few varieties and opened the boxes and put them all in a ziplock bag. The bag of completely packaged trail mix bars was in the ziplock bag and placed into my husband‚Äôs backpack. We went to bed and woke up to the bag on the floor with a hole chewed through the bag and trail mix bars out of the ziplock bag and the bar packaging had been chewed through and bars were partially eaten. (Bars did not contain chocolate, they were different fruit and nut bars) 

2) we were hosting a bbq so hamburger and hot dog buns were purchased a few days in advance. I put them in the basement in tied grocery bags and double bagged them with the ties on the opposite sides for each bag so there were no openings. Came downstairs to my office in the basement the next day and there was bread everywhere and multiple bags were chewed through and buns were eaten. 

3) just today he was searching for food on the counter and I was in my basement office. I heard a loud bang sound and went upstairs to the kitchen and my cat had knocked over a jug of coffee cooling on the counter. There was NO FOOD left out. I had cleaned off everything from making breakfast to try and avoid him from being on the counter. 

This cat will eat almost anything, including fruit and veggies. He steals cucumbers and edamame, blueberries. He recently jumped up and ate some curry we had cooking on the counter for our son while we were right there in the kitchen. We try to keep most food items in the microwave/oven to keep them away from him if we can‚Äôt put them away correctly for whatever reason but it doesn‚Äôt stop him from searching. 

He‚Äôs thin but not underweight, he‚Äôs 9lbs and not a very big cat. He gets plenty of attention and the cats have automatic feeders and get fed 3x a day. I am pretty sure he was the runt of the litter, he was sick when I got him at 6 weeks old with worms and not doing well. We‚Äôve always made sure he has plenty of food and we visit the vet annually for them and they get full work ups with blood checks and dental cleaning. They are in great health. 

TLDR: male cat keeps going out of his way to eat people food, how can I stop this behavior? ",2,1750339980.0,CatAdvice,2,1.0,False
1lfaxih,https://www.catkittyfood.com/baby-shower-food-catering/,Baby Shower Food Catering,"**Baby Shower Food Catering**

When planning a baby shower, one of the most important aspects to consider is the food. Baby shower food catering can transform your event from ordinary to extraordinary, ensuring that guests are well-fed and happy. By hiring a professional catering service, you can focus on celebrating while experts handle the menu.

Choosing the right baby shower food catering service involves considering the theme of your shower. Whether you‚Äôre hosting a whimsical garden party or a chic, modern gathering, the food should complement the overall aesthetic. Look for caterers who offer customizable menus, allowing you to select items that resonate with your theme and fit different dietary restrictions.

Popular options for baby shower food catering often include:

    Mini sandwiches or sliders
    Fresh fruit platters
    Assorted pastries and desserts
    Savory appetizers like meatballs or stuffed mushrooms
    Interactive food stations, such as a taco or pasta bar


Another advantage of hiring a catering service is the stress reduction it offers. With professionals managing food preparation and presentation, you won‚Äôt have to worry about cooking or setting up the food. This allows you to enjoy the company of your guests and partake in the festivities without the usual pressure that comes with hosting.

Finally, don‚Äôt forget to discuss beverage options with your caterer. From mocktail stations to a selection of teas and coffees, your drink offerings can elevate the overall experience. A comprehensive baby shower food catering package can ensure that every detail, from appetizers to desserts, is perfectly executed, making your event memorable.

First off, I‚Äôm an employee here, I‚Äôm the (only certified) cook. Worked in the summer of ‚Äò23 under the previous ownership which made some wild decisions. Just one particular fun fact about that time: no background checks for anyone, even management. That‚Äôs how a nearly 30 year old man got away with rampant drug use and a sexual affair with a 19 year old employee against his soon-not-be-his-husband. BUT, at least they *tried* to be a legitimate business back then. I left after finding a legitimate business, but I was let go due to low winter sales and came back to Coffeeology at the end of the winter. 

Now?

Y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm not a barista and I‚Äôm not in charge of when things get ordered, I have no power and do not wish to exercise any at this dumbfuck. So I sincerely apologize if any of your drinks have had ants or fruit flys in there, because we got them in droves right now. Ants have been crawling up the spouts of the containers up front and making homes in the bottles. DO NOT GET ANY DRINK WITH SUGAR IN IT. Those are the highest offenders for sure, and even my coworker the other day felt bad bc he wasn‚Äôt sure if anyone had ‚Äúfake chocolate chips‚Äù in the drinks he made. Not to mention they just shoved him up front after originally being hired as a cook, bc the other two baristas are out for the summer and the manager simply can‚Äôt be bothered to be on the schedule, I guess. There is one other barista that works here as of recently, but without slamming her too much, let‚Äôs just say you might not wanna get coffee from someone who‚Äôs never worked before. In all honesty, I have no idea how we‚Äôre even able to afford to hire anybody with how low our sales have been. The manager literally hired 2-3 new people, realized we couldn‚Äôt afford to pay them, and then fired them after like 3 training shifts each, that‚Äôs how bad it is. 

In terms of the food? I‚Äôm ServSafe certified, I‚Äôm doing my absolute best to keep the kitchen as close to code as I can, I do my absolute best to actually **cook** instead of just making food, I‚Äôm trying really hard to make sure nothing is bad or spoiled or rotten. And while I personally never use bad product and always stay as sanitary as possible, nobody else here right now is certified, so nobody else cares or puts as much effort into caring as I do. Partially due to innocent ignorance and improper training by management, but mostly because the manager is ineffectual. Like, if you‚Äôve gone there recently and been upset that we were out of certain products, blame the manager, they are incredibly impressive at how little they do their job. Necessary stuff wont get ordered for days, if we‚Äôre lucky, and anything that isn‚Äôt explicitly important just gets forgotten about. Thankfully, I haven‚Äôt seen any critters in my kitchen so you don‚Äôt have to worry about pepper flakes squirming in your sandwich. Well, at least not when I‚Äôm working. No shade to my other kitchen coworker, I love her as a person, but she‚Äôs never worked in a kitchen before and it shows. She doesn‚Äôt even realize how bad it is that a sizable chunk of our equipment is straight up broken. Half the oven doesn‚Äôt work, the panini press doesn‚Äôt have a handle, two of our fridges are broken now, the freezer broke a couple weeks ago, the ice machine is sentient and purposefully chooses not to operate on some days, the trip sink in the dish pit has fucked up drainage issues, the dishwasher is likely not working how it should, the Heatwell is about two thirsty shifts away from exploding, and there‚Äôs probably more I‚Äôm forgetting about due to my current frustration. Ugh. 

Cleanliness and hygiene? In the words of Joey Tribbiani, ‚ÄúFohghett abowwddit.‚Äù All we have is bleach. Just bleach. And dish soap too, but barely any sanitizer left, and I‚Äôm pretty sure the machine it‚Äôs hooked up to isn‚Äôt actually using it. We haven‚Äôt had clean rags since March, and that‚Äôs if we can even find one. Thankfully we have a bunch of trash bags now, but that‚Äôs not considered as much of a ‚Äúnecessary item‚Äù as I know they are. One day a couple weeks ago, we didn‚Äôt have any bags in the cans until 1pm. I don‚Äôt even wanna know what grime and unholy concoctions are at the bottom of those things, and because I was never trained how to clean their cans or shown what products and methods they‚Äôd like me to use, I‚Äôm not doing it unless I notice they pose a serious health risk. Our bathrooms are routinely out of order, and while we have one working toilet at the moment, the other one? Y‚Äôall. *Y‚Äôall.* I‚Äôve worked in a summer camp in the woods before, I‚Äôve been hiking, I‚Äôve seen some nasty scat before. I ain‚Äôt never seen or smelled anything like what‚Äôs in that broken toilet right now, dear gourd lorde. Shit looks like my black, bald stepfather, that‚Äôs how gross it is. We ain‚Äôt got no mop solution, hardly any hand soap or paper towels or toilet paper, and I‚Äôm like 99% certain nobody cleans the bathrooms on a consistent basis. I don‚Äôt even know if we have a plunger. 

*‚ÄùOh but OP, why not report them to the Health Department?‚Äù* Aha dear reader, I have, and they couldn‚Äôt do anything. The current owners are indefinitely stuck outside the country due to being immigrants (they were NOT snatched by ICE, they left for a couple weeks that turned into a couple months), and the Health Department said they wanted to wait until they returned to investigate further. I will place another after I finish typing because we NEED official eyes on the mess that‚Äôs been made, but with how difficult it was to contact them the first time, I don‚Äôt have high hopes for another report. If anyone reading this works for the Health Department in Guilford County, please come thru, I‚Äôll make milk and cookies for you, deadass (in a cleaner kitchen).

This place is trash y‚Äôall, and I strongly encourage y‚Äôall to stay the fuck away from this business and to share this with as many locals as possible. I‚Äôm not casting too much blame on the owners since they aren‚Äôt here at the moment, but the buck has to stop at the top, and a lot of the problems I see here were started well before I came back and they left. I am absolutely casting most of the blame on the manager, and I honestly hope they‚Äôre reading this and finally understanding why I vocally disparage them on the clock. I‚Äôve been a manager before (hell fucking no I‚Äôm not jealous of that bitch, I don‚Äôt want power here by any means), so I know how difficult it can be when times are tough and support is all but nil. But I also know how easy and simple it can be if you get your head out of your phone and actually *do your fucking job.* Ain‚Äôt no reason we should‚Äôve been out of trash bags until the afternoon when we have the College Mart 100 feet away. Ain‚Äôt no reason we should be out of half the menu when it‚Äôs your job to check inventory and send order lists to the owners. Ain‚Äôt no reason that toilet should be creating new forms of bacterial life when both plungers and plumbers have a long and storied tradition of fixing toilet issues in this state. 

Dear fucking crispy chicken tacos, I can‚Äôt even swear right anymore, this place turns my brain into a Ninja food processor. I‚Äôm being so genuine when I say working here makes me suicidal, it sucks. If I had been hired somewhere else before today with the hours and pay rate I actually need, this post wouldn‚Äôt exist (at least not this harshly). I‚Äôm truly only here bc they pay kind of good for a Greensboro coffee shop and I need to pay my bills, and for the admittedly vindictive feeling of taking money out of a trash establishment. I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôve said and done some harsh things regarding the leadership of this place, nothing illegal of course. I am 1000% biased against this place and you should take my words with at least one grain of salt, maybe a bit of paprika if you have any to spare. I do have a personal reason why I don‚Äôt want to help them, one that I would prefer not to disclose publicly unless I absolutely have to, but everyone I‚Äôve talked to about it has validated how fucked up it was so I know I‚Äôm not crazy. I just don‚Äôt trust them with even a single iota of my being. 

But for real, this isn‚Äôt a job, it‚Äôs not a business or community center, it‚Äôs a legitimate health hazard at this point. I‚Äôm fairly certain I got food poisoning Monday after making myself some food with their ingredients, and idk which one was the one that fucked me up. Straight up, I‚Äôve been typing this for 45 minutes now while I pace around the back because NOBODY HAS FUCKING OPENED THE STORE YET. I don‚Äôt have keys, idk if the new barista (that‚Äôs all by herself today) has keys, nobody important has responded in the group chat, idk what to do outside of breaking a window, and I‚Äôd sooner fuck a cop than pay these bastards for breaking their equipment. I really don‚Äôt wanna work here but I can‚Äôt just up and quit a job with no safety net, so I guess I‚Äôm gonna stay and attempt to keep MY ducks in a row until I find better employment. I‚Äôll do my absolute best to deliver the most quality food I can create, but I‚Äôm paddling up a waterfall, folks. I have no hope for this place and neither should you. 

Fuck Coffeeology. Don‚Äôt come here, don‚Äôt eat here, don‚Äôt drink here, don‚Äôt give them your money, they do not deserve it. You are risking your health and comfort by being a patron. I don‚Äôt drink coffee myself so I can‚Äôt speak as to which coffee shop on/near UNCG campus has the best brew, but even if we were serving the golden blood of the gods in every cup, with all the other issues we have you‚Äôd sooner turn into Medusa than Aphrodite. DO NOT APPLY TO WORK HERE. You won‚Äôt be trained properly and will be thrust into solo shifts regardless of whether you‚Äôre ready for it or not. You won‚Äôt get your first paycheck on time, and you likely won‚Äôt have those hours properly logged on your timesheet. There is zero good reason to enable these frauds, and I desperately hope that my pain and frustration is coming off in the way I intended. I really don‚Äôt wanna hurt this community, I‚Äôve been warning the locals I meet IRL for months now, but I can‚Äôt stay mostly silent about this forever. Please, for the love of whatever deity you‚Äôre subscribed to, stay away from Coffeeology. We will likely hurt you more than we could help you. 

Sincerely, A Current Employee.

Kendu is an organic, community focused memecoin that is currently evolving the memecoin game forever. Kendu's relentless IRL efforts spearheaded by just the average community member is simply breathtaking and it makes Kendu such an attractive asset for retail considering the crypto industry has been tarnished by all sorts of bad characters. Kendu is entirely focused on community building and we are totally decentralised. What makes Kendu special is that whilst we are dominating the IRL side of things, we also compete with the very best on social media. Kendu really is raising the standards for what a memecoin should be. 

**Kendu Certik Audit**

We have nearly 19k holders, sitting around 25 million market cap(at the time of writing this), Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, the only other coin to ever achieve this was Pepe(which reached an ATH of 10 billion outside of a bull run), as we near closer and closer to the largest bull run ever, using the word optimistic to describe my sentiment would be an understatement. Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 90.29, whilst coins like SPX have a score of 83.93. Kendu is outperforming coins in the billions all under 30 million market cap. If you understand the memecoin game you will know that community is all that matters. All Shib, Pepe and Doge had was a relentless community that never gave up and Kendu is no different. You can see the full Kendu audit here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

Here is a list of our IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee
* Kendu Press

In a world where AI is dominating, Kendu is the best and most complete proof of humanity, IRL products cannot be faked, but social media likes can be.

**My Advice To You**

Get in our telegram or subreddit and just check out the vibes, ask questions, get involved, compare metrics or whatever. I would always highly recommend anyone to join a coin's telegram before you make any investments. Even if it's just $20, this can easily become $20,000 At 10 Billion market cap, which is life changing to say the least.

I had planned to take this whole week off and then my trip extended 2 days. My husband, unexpectedly, also took this week off.

As I explained in a previous post, I‚Äôm currently going through a separation from my wife of three years‚Äîwe‚Äôve known each other for over eight. She cheated on me twice.

Yesterday, she came to pick up her things from our apartment after two weeks. (I‚Äôll be moving out in a couple of weeks.) She met someone at a bar few weeks ago and instantly moved in with him.

She came into the living room to take the coffee machine. I‚Äôve been staying there lately because the bedrooms feel suffocating. As she was leaving, I completely lost it. I told her what an absolutely horrible person she has been and how deeply she has hurt me over the past two months. She just stood there and listened.

I brought up the division of the few assets we have and told her that if she disagrees later, I‚Äôll take it to court‚Äîeven though we‚Äôve agreed to a consensual divorce to avoid legal proceedings. She said she didn‚Äôt want to see me hurt and that she wants everything done as soon as possible.

She cried a little while I was basically giving her the middle finger and asking how she could move in with someone else right after telling me she needed space ‚Äúto find herself and be alone.‚Äù

I teared up a bit later. But honestly, I didn‚Äôt feel good about how I reacted‚Äîespecially knowing it was the last time we‚Äôd see each other before the actual divorce.

I feel like I still care about her, even though my mind keeps telling me not to. Watching her break down and give our dog one last hug completely drained me emotionally.

Right now, grief is dangling me like a pendulum. Maybe one day it will steady. Maybe one day, I will too.

1lfaje4,https://i.redd.it/2j58juc6wv7f1.jpeg,$ATYR ‚Äì Paul Schimmel and the Origins of aTyr Pharma,"While newsflow on $ATYR is a little quieter than usual, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to go back to the very beginning and revisit the person whose science and vision underpin the entire aTyr Pharma company‚ÄîPaul Schimmel. In my view, when the headlines pause and trading chat cools off, it‚Äôs a good moment to reconnect with the story behind the stock: the calibre of its founders, the depth of the science, and the long-term DNA that gives me confidence, regardless of short-term noise.

Paul Schimmel isn‚Äôt just a co-founder or director listed on the company‚Äôs website‚Äîhe‚Äôs been a genuine driving force in the evolution of aTyr Pharma, and his influence stretches well beyond this company. His reputation as a scientist is well established, but what really stands out to me is his ability to bridge fundamental research and actual therapeutic innovation. Very few people can truly say they‚Äôve changed the direction of an entire field and then turned those discoveries into new medicines and real-world progress.

The more I read and synthesise about Schimmel, the clearer it becomes just how important his ongoing involvement is to aTyr. For me, this sort of founder story‚Äîrooted in rigorous science, real entrepreneurial success, and visible industry impact‚Äîis exactly the sort of anchor I look for when the market is less exciting. It‚Äôs a reminder of why some of us are here for the long game, not just the next headline.

## 1. The Scientific Architect: Paul Schimmel‚Äôs Foundational Research and Its Relevance to aTyr

When you look at a company like aTyr Pharma, it‚Äôs easy to focus on the pipeline or the next catalyst. But in my view, if you want to understand why a platform company like this exists in the first place‚Äîand why its lead programme is different‚Äîyou have to start with the person who actually built the intellectual foundation.

Paul Schimmel‚Äôs entire scientific career has revolved around the genetic code and its interpretation‚Äîespecially the enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which are responsible for linking amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs during protein synthesis. This is absolutely core molecular biology, and Schimmel‚Äôs group has been behind some of the most fundamental discoveries in this field.

After earning his Ph.D. in biophysical chemistry from MIT, Schimmel became the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at MIT before moving to The Scripps Research Institute, where he‚Äôs still active. He‚Äôs published around 500 papers and written a widely used three-volume textbook on biophysical chemistry‚Äîso when I say he‚Äôs one of the world‚Äôs preeminent biochemists, that‚Äôs not an exaggeration.

What really matters for aTyr investors, though, is the kind of research he‚Äôs done:  
- He discovered what‚Äôs often called the **‚Äúsecond genetic code,‚Äù** identifying key sequence elements in tRNA that determine how they are aminoacylated‚Äîa major leap forward in understanding genetic information processing.  
- He showed that tRNA synthetases have a **modular design**, with distinct parts for specific functions, which later turned out to have big implications for their ‚Äòextracurricular‚Äô activities in the body.
- He was first to show these enzymes actually have built-in **editing functions**‚Äîessentially, a way to ‚Äúproofread‚Äù protein synthesis, which is crucial for preventing cellular errors and diseases.
- On top of this, his early work on **expressed sequence tags (ESTs)** and **shotgun sequencing** contributed directly to the launch of the Human Genome Project. *Nature* even recognised his EST work as one of the four most important technical developments for that project.

What makes Schimmel stand out‚Äîand what is so relevant for aTyr‚Äîis how he shifted from classic enzyme biology to the discovery that these same enzymes act as secreted signalling molecules (**Physiocrines**) with broad roles in immune regulation, angiogenesis, and more. This is the conceptual leap that created the whole Physiocrine biology that underpins aTyr‚Äôs therapeutic platform.

In my opinion, it‚Äôs rare to see a founder who has not only uncovered something genuinely new about biology but has then built a company from the ground up to translate that insight into new medicines. That‚Äôs the connection: aTyr‚Äôs drug development is directly rooted in Schimmel‚Äôs own discoveries, not borrowed IP or outsourced science. When I‚Äôm evaluating biotech platforms, that kind of origin story always stands out‚Äîespecially when the founder is still actively involved in guiding the company‚Äôs science.

If you want the full details, here‚Äôs a quick summary table of Schimmel‚Äôs biggest scientific achievements and why they matter for aTyr:

| **Discovery/Concept**                              | **Year**   | **Description**                                                                                  | **Why It Matters for aTyr**              |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ‚ÄúSecond Genetic Code‚Äù                              | 1988       | Revealed tRNA acceptor stem signals for aminoacylation, beyond triplet codon                     | Core to understanding aaRS function       |
| Modular Design of tRNA Synthetases                 | 1983       | Showed these enzymes have distinct domains for different activities                              | Key to Physiocrine domain drug design     |
| Editing Functions in tRNA Synthetases              | 1972       | Discovered aaRS enzymes ‚Äúproofread‚Äù protein synthesis                                            | Prevents disease, relates to immunity     |
| Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) & Shotgun Seq.      | 1983       | Developed gene expression mapping and gene discovery techniques                                  | Enabled Human Genome Project              |
| ‚ÄúNew Biology‚Äù of tRNA Synthetases (Physiocrines)   | 2010s      | Found that aaRS enzymes have immune, vascular, and signalling roles beyond protein synthesis     | Direct basis of aTyr‚Äôs entire platform    |

For me, the big takeaway is that aTyr‚Äôs pipeline and technology aren‚Äôt just the product of some clever repurposing‚Äîthey‚Äôre the natural extension of decades of foundational research led by a true leader in the field. That matters, especially when you‚Äôre trying to judge the depth and durability of a small biotech‚Äôs platform.

## 2. The Entrepreneurial Catalyst: Translating Scientific Breakthroughs into Biotech Companies

It‚Äôs one thing to make major discoveries at the lab bench‚Äîit‚Äôs another thing entirely to turn those breakthroughs into companies, therapies, and real patient impact. In my experience, the biotech sector is filled with brilliant scientists and skilled entrepreneurs, but it‚Äôs exceptionally rare to find someone who has excelled at both. **Paul Schimmel is one of those outliers.**

Over the course of his career, Schimmel has not just published scientific papers‚Äîhe‚Äôs played a hands-on role in founding and building several of the most successful biotech companies of the last few decades. He holds dozens of patents and has been a founding force behind at least seven companies that have either listed on NASDAQ or been acquired by major players. These include Repligen, Alkermes, Cubist Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Merck), Alnylam, Sirtris (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Momenta, Abide, and of course, aTyr Pharma. These aren‚Äôt just random start-ups‚Äîmany of these companies are responsible for breakthrough medicines, including first-in-class or best-in-class therapeutics that have genuinely changed clinical practice.

From my perspective, the significance for aTyr investors is twofold. First, Schimmel‚Äôs track record as a serial founder in biotech brings a level of credibility and executional know-how that you almost never see at small-cap companies. It‚Äôs not just that he knows the science‚Äîhe knows how to move that science from the research stage, through intellectual property protection, all the way into drug development and commercialisation. Second, his ongoing involvement means that aTyr benefits from the sort of strategic leadership that understands both the commercial realities of biotech and the scientific nuance behind the platform.

aTyr itself is a great example of this approach. The company wasn‚Äôt built by licensing someone else‚Äôs discovery or by repackaging generic science. It was co-founded by Schimmel in 2005 (along with John Clarke and Xiang-Lei Yang), based directly on the new biology of tRNA synthetases and Physiocrines that he and his colleagues uncovered in their own labs. Even early funding was secured on the strength of this original science‚Äîventure firms saw that this was something truly proprietary.

In my opinion, when you see a founder who has a genuine track record of building multiple successful biotech companies from scratch‚Äîespecially ones that have delivered FDA-approved medicines and real exits‚Äîit‚Äôs a sign that the team knows how to avoid common pitfalls and stay focused on long-term value creation. This is especially relevant for retail investors like us, who often don‚Äôt get the same level of visibility or comfort in the founding story as institutional insiders do.

Here‚Äôs a summary table of companies Schimmel has co-founded or played a foundational role in‚Äîjust to give a sense of his entrepreneurial impact:

| Company Name             | Schimmel‚Äôs Role        | Current Status            | Key Focus/Impact                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Repligen                 | Co-founder            | NASDAQ-listed            | Biologics, therapeutic development                |
| Alkermes                 | Co-founder            | NASDAQ-listed            | Neuroscience, oncology, addiction                 |
| Cubist Pharmaceuticals   | Co-founder            | Acquired by Merck        | Antibiotics (e.g. Cubicin), infectious diseases   |
| Alnylam                  | Co-founder, Director  | NASDAQ-listed            | RNAi therapeutics                                 |
| Sirtris                  | Co-founder            | Acquired by GSK          | Sirtuin activators for age-related diseases       |
| Momenta                  | Founding Director     | NASDAQ-listed            | Biosimilars, novel biologics                      |
| Abide Pharmaceuticals    | Co-founder            | Acquired by Lundbeck     | Serine hydrolase inhibitors                      |
| aTyr Pharma              | Co-founder, Director  | NASDAQ-listed            | Physiocrine therapeutics for ILD                  |

For me, that entrepreneurial track record is a key reason I feel comfortable that aTyr‚Äôs platform isn‚Äôt just a scientific curiosity, but a foundation for building something of real value in the industry.

When it comes to aTyr Pharma, what stands out to me is how directly the company‚Äôs foundation is tied to Schimmel‚Äôs own discoveries. aTyr wasn‚Äôt spun out of an academic lab as an afterthought or built around in-licensed molecules‚Äîthis company was purpose-built around the ‚Äúnew biology‚Äù that Schimmel himself uncovered, specifically the concept of Physiocrines: signalling domains derived from tRNA synthetases with major therapeutic potential.

The founding story matters here, in my view, because it speaks to the level of conviction, insight, and technical depth at the heart of the company. Schimmel and his co-founders (including John Clarke and Xiang-Lei Yang) recognised that their discoveries about the extracellular roles of tRNA synthetases could be much more than a scientific curiosity‚Äîthey could represent an entirely new class of drugs, addressing serious unmet needs in inflammatory and fibrotic disease.

Right from the start in 2005, Schimmel has served as a director at aTyr, shaping not just the scientific direction, but the business strategy as well. The company‚Äôs early venture capital backers were persuaded by the strength and originality of this science‚Äîa very different setup to the typical small-cap biotech, which is often reliant on recycling legacy IP or chasing fast-follower opportunities. In my opinion, that kind of direct scientific lineage is something investors should care about. It means the company has a deep-rooted competitive advantage: the people who made the original discoveries are directly involved in translating them into therapeutics.

aTyr‚Äôs approach was also global from the outset, with a majority-owned subsidiary (Pangu BioPharma) set up in China to tap into local talent and funding. This sort of forward-thinking, in my view, reflects the strategic leadership that‚Äôs guided the company through multiple stages of growth‚Äîsomething you rarely see outside of the very top tier of biotech founders.

Most importantly, Schimmel‚Äôs continuing presence on the board signals ongoing scientific rigour and high-level strategic alignment. For retail investors like us, it‚Äôs a genuine positive signal: you‚Äôre not betting on a team that‚Äôs detached from the original science or one that‚Äôs just following a trend. Instead, you‚Äôre aligned with a founder who‚Äôs been hands-on since day one, guiding the evolution of the company as it navigates both the science and the business realities of drug development.

**4. Efzofitimod: Translating Foundational Science into a First-in-Class Therapy**

Efzofitimod is, in my view, the signature proof point of Schimmel‚Äôs entire translational vision. This is a molecule that wouldn‚Äôt even exist without his original work uncovering new roles for tRNA synthetases‚Äînamely, their ability to act as extracellular signalling proteins with effects far beyond their traditional role in protein synthesis. aTyr took that biology and, rather than building another ‚Äòme too‚Äô therapy, developed an entirely new biologic with a unique mechanism: selective modulation of neuropilin-2 (NRP2) on myeloid cells, aimed at taming pathological inflammation while avoiding broad immune suppression.

For anyone following the company‚Äôs clinical progress, it‚Äôs clear this isn‚Äôt theoretical. Efzofitimod has shown dose-dependent effects in Phase 1b/2a trials for pulmonary sarcoidosis, including significant reductions in steroid use and relapse rates‚Äîtwo endpoints that really matter to patients and clinicians. What stands out to me is the careful, stepwise nature of the programme: from preclinical data showing robust anti-inflammatory effects, through a healthy volunteer study confirming safety, and into patient trials where real-world outcomes are already visible. The drug‚Äôs design is built on a detailed understanding of the disease mechanism and leverages the core science behind Physiocrines.

I also think it‚Äôs important to point out the scale and ambition of the current Phase 3 programme: this is not a small ‚Äòproof of concept‚Äô‚Äîit‚Äôs the largest placebo-controlled study ever conducted in pulmonary sarcoidosis. The trial‚Äôs focus on steroid tapering is pragmatic and patient-centric, targeting a long-standing pain point for both the clinical community and the people living with the disease. Topline data are expected later this year, and, in my view, a positive readout would represent not just a scientific win, but a major validation of Schimmel‚Äôs lifelong work and the company‚Äôs translational platform.

The reach of efzofitimod doesn‚Äôt stop at pulmonary sarcoidosis, either. Early data in systemic sclerosis-related ILD suggests the drug‚Äôs targeted immunomodulation could be relevant for a broader set of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases‚Äîa testament to the versatility and depth of the underlying science.

For investors, what I see here is a genuine first-in-class asset, one built from the ground up on original discoveries by a founder still actively involved. That‚Äôs a rare story in biotech, and one that gives me confidence in both the company‚Äôs potential for near-term catalysts and its longer-term pipeline ambitions.

**5. Efzofitimod in Phase 3: Addressing Critical Unmet Needs**

The advancement of efzofitimod into a pivotal global Phase 3 study is, in my view, a watershed moment for both aTyr Pharma and the broader ILD field. The company‚Äôs approach is notable for its ambition and its focus on what really matters to patients‚Äînamely, breaking the decades-long dependency on steroids as the mainstay of sarcoidosis treatment.

The EFZO-FIT‚Ñ¢ study stands out as the largest placebo-controlled trial ever run in pulmonary sarcoidosis, enrolling over 260 patients across 85 sites in nine countries. The study‚Äôs primary endpoint is absolute steroid reduction, which directly targets one of the greatest burdens faced by people with sarcoidosis and those who care for them. To me, the decision to use a forced steroid taper as part of the protocol signals a practical, real-world approach that‚Äôs likely to resonate with regulators, clinicians, and payers alike.

In my view, the repeated ‚Äúcontinue as planned‚Äù recommendations from four independent DSMB reviews are a significant green flag. It tells me that efzofitimod is not only meeting its safety benchmarks, but that there are no red flags prompting adjustments or trial modifications. This is especially important given the historical lack of innovation in sarcoidosis, where no new therapies have been approved for nearly 70 years.

For context, pulmonary sarcoidosis remains a chronic, often disabling disease, with substantial unmet needs in terms of both efficacy and tolerability of existing therapies. Steroid side effects are not a minor issue‚Äîthey‚Äôre a major driver of morbidity and, in many cases, poor long-term outcomes. Efzofitimod‚Äôs potential to reduce or even eliminate steroid dependence would be a true paradigm shift for the field.

I also think it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the broader relevance of this platform. Systemic sclerosis-related ILD is another area with high unmet need, where current options are extremely limited and disease progression is often relentless. Early signals from aTyr‚Äôs EFZO-CONNECT‚Ñ¢ Phase 2 study suggest that efzofitimod‚Äôs impact on inflammation and fibrosis may extend well beyond sarcoidosis.

For investors, I see this as a genuine inflection point. A positive Phase 3 readout wouldn‚Äôt just be a milestone for aTyr‚Äîit would represent a real breakthrough for patients and could put the company at the forefront of immunology-driven drug development. The regulatory designations and the attention from key opinion leaders reflect the urgency and relevance of what‚Äôs at stake here.

**6. The High Unmet Need in Interstitial Lung Diseases**

In my view, one of the most compelling reasons to remain focused on aTyr Pharma is the sheer scale of unmet medical need in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs)‚Äîespecially pulmonary sarcoidosis and systemic sclerosis-related ILD (SSc-ILD). These are not niche, inconsequential conditions: in the US alone, up to 200,000 people live with pulmonary sarcoidosis, and thousands more are diagnosed each year. Yet for decades, the standard of care has barely moved. Patients are still being treated with oral glucocorticoids‚Äîdrugs that come with major side effects and only partial, temporary efficacy.

The real-world burden of these diseases is sobering. Most patients will require long-term steroids, and a significant proportion end up cycling through multiple rounds of immunosuppressive therapy as their disease waxes and wanes. Recent data show that 72‚Äì78% of sarcoidosis patients need ongoing treatment within three years of diagnosis, and over 90% of those will end up on glucocorticoids. But the issues don‚Äôt stop there: up to 30% of patients relapse as steroids are tapered, and roughly one in eight patients are hospitalised within a three-year period. For older individuals, the mortality rate for pulmonary sarcoidosis is almost double that of the general population.

The situation with SSc-ILD is no less challenging. Around 100,000 people in the US are affected by systemic sclerosis, and up to 80% develop ILD. SSc-ILD is responsible for a third of all deaths in systemic sclerosis, and up to 30% of patients will experience progression of their lung disease in any given year. Current therapies are blunt instruments at best, mostly aiming to slow inevitable decline rather than deliver real disease modification.

This context is, to me, precisely what makes aTyr‚Äôs approach so relevant. The science underpinning efzofitimod is designed to address the inflammation and fibrosis at the heart of these diseases, not just suppress symptoms. The regulatory landscape recognises this: both efzofitimod and the broader platform have been awarded multiple Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the US, EU, and Japan. These are not cosmetic accolades‚Äîthey reflect genuine urgency and belief in the promise of this technology.

For retail investors, the significance is clear. The magnitude of unmet need translates directly to commercial opportunity if efzofitimod delivers on its promise. It also means that aTyr‚Äôs clinical and regulatory momentum isn‚Äôt built on hype, but on a foundation of real patient need and regulatory endorsement.

**7. Broader Context and Strategic Importance**

In my view, Paul Schimmel‚Äôs presence on aTyr Pharma‚Äôs board and his ongoing scientific guidance are not just reassuring‚Äîthey provide a strategic backbone that‚Äôs rare in the small- and mid-cap biotech universe. Many companies in this sector boast impressive advisory boards or sprinkle Nobel laureates across their decks, but it‚Äôs uncommon to see a founder of Schimmel‚Äôs calibre actively involved in scientific decision-making, strategic direction, and oversight deep into a company‚Äôs lifecycle.

For context, Schimmel isn‚Äôt just a renowned academic or a passive figurehead. His direct involvement has repeatedly influenced the success of multiple biotech ventures, several of which have matured into public companies or gone on to develop FDA-approved drugs‚Äîthink Cubist (acquired by Merck for $9.5B), Alnylam (an RNAi leader), Momenta, and Alkermes. Each of these enterprises set benchmarks in their respective fields, often leading to paradigm shifts in drug development, regulatory strategy, and translational medicine. His experience in shepherding new science from concept through to clinical and commercial execution is not only rare but has proven remarkably effective. In my opinion, this pedigree matters for aTyr, because it translates to a higher likelihood of robust pipeline development, regulatory engagement, and ultimately, commercial viability.

Looking at the broader biotech landscape, founders of Schimmel‚Äôs stature are often lured away by private capital or leave for academic posts, especially after an IPO. It‚Äôs telling that Schimmel has remained so engaged with aTyr, overseeing a platform that is both scientifically original and has demonstrated real translational promise. His commitment also signals to the outside world‚Äîincluding prospective partners, institutional investors, and regulators‚Äîthat the company‚Äôs innovation engine is legitimate and well-grounded. In the sometimes noisy, narrative-driven world of early-stage biotech, that kind of sustained, first-principles leadership is, in my opinion, a critical differentiator.

Another point worth highlighting is the direct scientific lineage that ties aTyr‚Äôs core discoveries (Physiocrines, NRP2 targeting, and the entire aaRS-based therapeutic platform) back to Schimmel‚Äôs foundational work. This is not a case of technology being licensed from a third-party lab, or founders stepping away as the company matures. The translational pipeline at aTyr‚ÄîEfzofitimod and beyond‚Äîremains anchored in the lab-based insights and ongoing curiosity of its co-founder, giving the business both scientific credibility and a unique narrative in the public markets.

In my experience, institutional investors, potential partners, and even regulators will often look for this kind of ‚Äúfounder imprint‚Äù as a sign of real scientific depth and executional follow-through. The fact that Schimmel continues to shape the direction of aTyr‚Äîyears after its founding‚Äîreinforces to me that the company is not just riding on past reputation but is actively working to create value at the cutting edge of immunology and rare disease.

Finally, for our community, I think it‚Äôs important to appreciate that aTyr‚Äôs differentiation is not just a scientific one, but a governance and cultural one as well. The company‚Äôs roots in original research, real-world commercialisation, and durable board oversight provide a layer of quality control and ambition that, in my view, is rare among its peer group. It‚Äôs a long-term anchor that, especially in periods of market uncertainty or news droughts, can help retail investors distinguish between real platform potential and mere speculation.

**8. Summary / Key Takeaways**

In my opinion, Paul Schimmel‚Äôs ongoing involvement with aTyr Pharma is one of the clearest signals of both scientific depth and institutional quality you‚Äôll find in the small-cap biotech world. His track record as a scientist, founder, and entrepreneur is not only impressive on paper‚Äîit‚Äôs directly relevant to how aTyr is positioned in the market and how it is navigating the complex process of clinical translation.

For me, the most important takeaway is that aTyr‚Äôs platform and lead asset, efzofitimod, are not accidents of opportunistic drug development or the result of externally acquired IP. They are the result of decades of original research, a clear founding vision, and the direct scientific lineage from one of the field‚Äôs most respected minds. Schimmel‚Äôs history of taking discoveries from the lab bench to the patient bedside‚Äîoften through multiple successful, publicly traded ventures‚Äîshould give investors real confidence that the company is operating with a level of scientific and strategic rigour that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere.

In a market where headlines and sentiment can shift quickly, I see Schimmel‚Äôs continued presence and guidance as an anchor. It gives me conviction that aTyr‚Äôs current path, while still subject to all the usual uncertainties of biotech, is informed by a genuinely unique foundation and leadership. For our community, that‚Äôs the kind of story and underlying reality I look for when evaluating whether to stay the course, especially in quieter periods between catalysts.

I will travel through SE Asia this summer before going to Japan for a few months. I initially wanted to spend my time in Thailand where I lived in the past and say hi to old friends, but I am getting more and more curious about first visiting Vietnam, where I have never been and seem to have so much beauty to discover. 

I am not into fast and checkbox traveling, and I prefer to just go to one place for a few weeks, and take the time to get the rhythm, meet people, create connections etc. In that idea, I discovered Hoi An, and it seems to be a truly beautiful place. It also has the practicality of being close to Da Nang airport, which has direct flights to Bangkok. 

Now, the more I do research, the more I see it being absolutely packed with tourists, and the beach front seems to actually be gigantic resorts. Hence, my question: How is Hoi An in summer, regarding the number of tourists? Is the city still mostly populated by locals, and still ""authentic"" in that sense, or is it mostly resorts and tourist keychains stores? No judgement here of course. It's just that I don't feel for being in a place that is mostly resort-heavy, and I would like to be somewhere that has life but also quiet, where I could just swim and bike around, be lazy, have a coffee while enjoying the atmosphere, and discuss with people. 

I will for sure spend more time in Vietnam in the future, but for now, I am mostly looking for this one single place where I can sit and simply be.

1lfaf78,https://i.redd.it/7fyg4092vv7f1.png,Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration,"Hey everyone! I've been experimenting with morning routines lately, and I stumbled across something that's been a total game-changer for my energy levels and overall well-being. It's called the **Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration**, and honestly, I was skeptical at first.

Like most of you, I've tried countless ""detox"" drinks that promised the world but delivered nothing. But this one? It's different. Not because it's some miracle cure, but because it actually makes sense from a hydration and mineral balance perspective.

**What got me interested in the first place**

I'd been dealing with that sluggish morning feeling we all know too well - you know, when you wake up but feel like you need three cups of coffee just to function like a human being. A friend mentioned she'd been starting her day with this Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration, and she looked genuinely more energetic than usual.

üëâ *Curious to try this at home? Here's the full recipe:* [https://www.amgroyal.com/pink-salt-weight-loss-recipe/](https://www.amgroyal.com/pink-salt-weight-loss-recipe/)

**The science behind it (without getting too nerdy)**

Pink Himalayan salt isn't just regular table salt with a fancy color. It contains trace minerals that your body actually needs - things like magnesium, potassium, and calcium. When you've been sleeping for 8 hours, you're essentially in a fasted, slightly dehydrated state. Your body craves proper hydration, not just water.

The Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration works because it helps restore your electrolyte balance while kickstarting your metabolism. It's not magic - it's just giving your body what it needs to function optimally.

**Quality matters more than you think**

Here's something I learned the hard way: not all pink salt is created equal. I initially bought the cheapest stuff I could find at the grocery store, and the results were... meh. The taste was harsh, and I didn't feel any of the benefits people were raving about.

Then I invested in high-quality Himalayan pink salt from a reputable source. Night and day difference. The flavor was smoother, almost slightly sweet, and my body responded completely differently. When it comes to the Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration, ingredient quality genuinely affects the outcome.

**The texture secret (and why it matters)**

This might sound weird, but getting the texture right is crucial for this recipe. It's not just about dumping salt into water and calling it a day. There's a specific way to dissolve and blend the ingredients that creates this almost silky consistency.

I can't give away all the details here, but I will say this: temperature matters, timing matters, and the order you add ingredients matters. When done correctly, you get this perfectly balanced drink that doesn't taste like you're chugging ocean water.

**A bit of fascinating history**

Pink salt has been used for centuries in traditional medicine practices, particularly in South Asian cultures. Ancient practitioners understood that mineral-rich salt could support digestion and energy levels. The Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration isn't some trendy Instagram invention - it's based on time-tested principles that have helped people feel better for generations.

What's interesting is how this ancient wisdom aligns with modern understanding of hydration and electrolyte balance. Sometimes the old ways really do know best.

**My honest experience after 30 days**

I've been doing this consistently for about a month now, and here's what I've noticed:

* My energy levels are more stable throughout the morning
* I'm not reaching for that second cup of coffee as desperately
* My digestion seems smoother (TMI, but it's true)
* I feel more hydrated overall, even on busy days

I'm not claiming this Pink Salt Weight Loss Recipe: Simple Morning Detox With Hydration is a miracle weight loss solution. But as part of a healthy routine, it's been genuinely helpful for feeling more balanced and energized.

**Things to keep in mind**

Don't expect overnight transformations. This isn't a quick fix - it's more about supporting your body's natural processes. Also, if you have any health conditions, especially related to blood pressure or kidney function, definitely check with your doctor first.

The recipe itself is surprisingly simple once you know the proper technique, but like most worthwhile things, consistency is key. I've found that preparing it the night before makes my mornings much smoother.

**Final thoughts**

I know how it sounds - another person on Reddit swearing by their latest health hack. But honestly, this one has stuck for me in a way that most trends don't. It's practical, affordable, and doesn't require any dramatic lifestyle changes.

If you're looking for a gentle way to support your morning routine and overall hydration, this might be worth exploring. Just remember: quality ingredients and proper technique make all the difference.

1lfaf74,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/1lfaf74/my_mum_had_me_at_18_because_of_mormonism_now_we/,"my mum had me at 18 because of mormonism. now we are no longer religious, and i know she regrets having me.","my mum was married and had me at 18 years old because that was the expectation in the mormon church: get married young and have as many kids as you can. but i know she was hoping for a different kind of child, and instead she got me. it‚Äôs not surprising that my family is kind of dysfunctional, because my parents were basically kids when they had me.

my mum is a perfectionist. growing up mormon, she followed the expectations and doctrines exactly. modesty, no coffee, tea or alcohol, tidiness, purity, virtuous, while still being academically driven and socially thriving. maybe this is just the way she portrays it, but she was seemingly the perfect child.

i am the polar opposite. i am now 18 and almost graduated high school, and throughout growing up i have come to realise that my mum expected to give birth to another her. 

i am extremely unorganised and messy, and have extremely bad ADHD. i have really struggled throughout school, moving 8 different times, and finding studying so difficult because i am completely unable to focus. i spent most of my teenage years depressed, anorexic, and fighting going to school and really leaving my room at all.

while i am in a good place now, with good friends and a very positive outlook on life, i do still struggle in school, but most of all i struggle to get along with my mother.

we are both quite argumentative and won‚Äôt back down from arguments, which is problematic because we often don‚Äôt agree on things. however, my mum often says things out of anger, which she will apologise for, but they always stay with me. she has called me entitled, selfish, abusive, narcissistic, and ungrateful countless times, and constantly claims i don‚Äôt care about anyone else but myself. she has also said things like ‚Äòi didn‚Äôt know it was going to be this hard‚Äô when talking about raising me. 

i know people say things they don‚Äôt mean out of anger often, but the main reason i know she regrets having me is because of the things she says when she is completely calm and unprovoked. for example, when we were discussing how ADHD is genetic, but she doesn‚Äôt have it, she mentioned that she thought she would get another daughter just like her, saying ‚Äòi thought i would get another me.‚Äô she has also emphasised how much she doesn‚Äôt recommend having kids young, and tells me how much i shouldn‚Äôt do it because
looking back, she shouldn‚Äôt have.  she has also said to both me and my sister; ‚Äúi love my kids, and now i wouldn‚Äôt give them up, but if i could go back and do it again i definitely wouldn‚Äôt have kids as young as i did.‚Äù

i am the oldest of 4 kids, all with ADHD and one with autism. i am certain that raising us would be by no means easy. i respect how my parents have both gone from having no money and being married and moved out young, to raising 4 kids and working hard to send us to private schools, to pay for the wifi, piano lessons, etc. but the other thing my mum has said multiple times is about how i am the most expensive, selfish, and difficult child to raise out of all of my siblings. i know its true, and i dont mean to be, but it does still hurt to hear.

i know the only reason she had me is because the church told her to, and i think she could secretly hate me. i don‚Äôt blame her at all, i know she has a lot of generational trauma in her family and gets triggered easily, but i do think some of the generational trauma has been passed down to me, and her words affect my self-worth quite a lot.

to put it bluntly, i think she just regrets most of her life. she never really got to live or be a teenager or have fun because of Mormonism. her first kiss was my dad. she was never allowed piercings or to wear a tank top. we both tried alcohol around the same times because i was a teenager when we left the church, and i just don‚Äôt think she has known how to raise a teenager because she was never one herself. i know she is probably doing her best to love me now that i‚Äôm here, but its obvious how much easier her life would have been if getting married and having kids was her choice, and not a decision pressured on her as a teenager. and i know she would never want to admit that she wishes she didn‚Äôt have me, but its something i can just tell, and its been a rough acceptance to live with.

1lfadyk,https://i.redd.it/cerh9f26sv7f1.jpeg,My first lovesick witchery order,"Reviews on reddit made me get my own, I originally purchassed Velvet Mallow and the other one was added with my purchase. 

Small review:

Velvet mallow -  The initial note is graham crackers, lead by marshmallow. I can't smell the chocolate, but it might be because the marshmallow overpowers them. It also smells musky and powdery. 6/10

To be devoured by you my darling - The initial note is coffee and then liqueur, and lastly cacao. I can't smell the other notes, the liqueur is overpowering. However, I feel like maybe the liqueur and the combination of the other notes give it a sweet cherry scent. This was my favorite one. 8/10

  
In general, they are a grown up scent and they smell great. I'd mainly use these during the night to hang out with friends, as they have this dark but clean scent. Something I wanted to add is that they kind of smell like incense on my skin, and I love it, but I don't think it's something that I want to smell like in a work setting.

HELPLESS AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO,"Hey guys, I've been working out on and off since 2022. Initially for a year it was muscleblaze biozyme whey.. after I changed the gym I changed my whey to Avvatar since prices were same (that time) and they were offering 28 grams of protein per scoop (every gram matters for a vegetarian).
After getting bored with malai kulfi flavor, during May's sale I ordered Avvatar's 100% performance whey, cold coffee flavor for the first time (They rebranded 100% performace whey in 2025, giving 25 grams per scoop, until last year they were giving 22 grams per scoop, 35 gms scoop size in both). 


So I received the product on 3rd June, and thankfully I checked the Mfg date before opening the seal and I was shocked to see that they sent me an old batch Mfg product from 9/12/24 offering only 22 grams protein ( which was in circulation before the rebranded one)..so I technically paid the price for the latest product but got an old product which used to be sold for much lesser price last year.
Always thought of Avvatar as one of the best brands but now that there is something wrong with my parcel and I tried reaching them, i realised how pathetic and shitty their customer services are. 
They don't pick up the calls on their toll free number(for 2-3 minutes the IVR says our customer executives are busy kindly wait..after which it says ""we've noted your number and our executives will call you back, thank you"", but nobody calls you back), they don't reply on WhatsApp. On the emails they reply 3-4 days later when they say that we'll get back to you in 24-48 hours on a priority basis. I've been trying to reach a resolution since 3rd June and it's already 17th and I can't even open the whey since I have to keep it seal packed to return. I'm without whey for so many days. Never expected this from Avvatar..feeling helpless. Won't go back to them no matter what. 
I even tweeted but got no response there also... 
It's been literally 2 weeks and there's no conclusion yet.

I don't know what to do...it's been 17 days and I'm helpless. I can't open that product. They don't reply when I said I'd need a refund and I'd be moving to another protein brand. 
5-6 days ago their customer caremperson called me and said he'll get it reverse picked up but what about all these 17 days that they fucked me up for no reason?",1,1750338370.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúCoward‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Adrian‚Äôs words have a quiet venom to them. She‚Äôs glaring at me, her eyes still filled with tears. As I move closer to her, she flinches away.

¬†¬†¬†‚Äú*You‚Äôre a fucking coward‚Ä¶*‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt deny it. She‚Äôs right. All the same, I pick up her glasses off the floor and gently help her get them back on her face.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúClover‚Ä¶ get something for the bleeding,‚Äù I say. Clover nods and after glancing over at the balcony to make sure Mama Kim isn‚Äôt watching, goes to get a dish towel. I help Adrian sit up. She doesn‚Äôt fight me.¬†

Karla doesn‚Äôt do jack shit. She just sits there, staring at the needle, before glancing over toward the balcony where Mama is. I keep expecting her to go for it, but apparently she‚Äôs got more discipline than that. Who knew.

Mama‚Äôs phone is ringing again. It‚Äôs the same altered ringtone. The same french song. I glance over at it but I don‚Äôt have the time or mental capacity to think too hard about it right now. 

Clover returns with a dish towel. We press it against Adrian‚Äôs stump to try and stop the bleeding.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian murmurs. I ignore her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all your fault‚Ä¶ all your fucking fault‚Ä¶‚Äù

Karla is finally looking at us, as if she only just checked back in and realized we were still there. Her eyes especially settle on me. She doesn‚Äôt say anything. I assume she‚Äôs just watching to see if we‚Äôre going to try and take the heroin, and for the first time in my life I honestly couldn‚Äôt care less about the fucking dope.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just keep pressure on it,‚Äù I say to Adrian.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúS-should I try and get some ice?‚Äù Clover asks. ‚ÄúFor the finger‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYeah, let‚Äôs give it a shot.‚Äù¬†

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs actually going to work or if it‚Äôs even worth it‚Ä¶ but at the moment, it feels right. Clover gets up again, rushing back to Mama‚Äôs kitchen. I can hear her moving around in there. Adrian has started pressing her other hand on the towel. She‚Äôs still shaking. She looks up at me again and I see her tense up. She opens her mouth to speak, but I only hear part of what she‚Äôs trying to say.

¬†¬†*‚ÄúKarla wa-‚Äù*

Pain erupts through my skull as something hard is slammed across the back of my head. I hit the ground, gasping in pain and see Karla standing over me, holding the empty bucket.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you‚Ä¶‚Äù She says, her tone bitterly gleeful. ‚ÄúOh, Mama‚Äôs gonna be so happy with me.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúKarla just wait!‚Äù* Adrian tries to say. While I can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôm in her good books right now, I‚Äôm glad that she at least draws the line at hitting me over the head with a bucket.

Karla unfortunately isn‚Äôt in a listening mood. She kicks Adrian hard in the stomach, earning a groan of pain out of her, before going back over to me.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one causing this mess‚Ä¶‚Äù She says as she stands over me.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYou finally put your last two brain cells together long enough to figure that out, huh?‚Äù I rasp.¬†

Karla hits me again, this time with her fist.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOh, Mama‚Äôs gonna skin you‚Ä¶‚Äù She hisses before opening her mouth to scream‚Ä¶ but she never gets the chance.

There‚Äôs a blur of motion as Clover‚Äôs fist connects with Karla‚Äôs face.¬† I hear her gasp in pain as Clover lunges for her, trying to keep Karla from crying out. I want to tell her not to bother‚Ä¶ It's pointless to hide it anymore, but she and Karla are grappling with each other as Karla tries to get free.

Karla stumbles back and loses her balance, sending both of them crashing into the coffee table. The glass shatters on impact, the wood breaks under their weight and I notice the heroin syringe rolling on the ground. Karla rips herself free from Clover‚Äôs grasp and I hear her cry out:

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúMAMA!‚Äù*

Mama Kim is already looking at us. She‚Äôs been looking since Karla and Clover crashed into the coffee table. I can see a flash of panic in Clover‚Äôs eyes. I try to yell at her to stop, that it doesn‚Äôt matter, that she doesn't need to protect me - but I can‚Äôt say the words in time.¬†

Running off pure impulse, I see Clover grab the syringe off the ground. Karla is trying to say something else, but that last word trails off into a strangled scream as Clover grabs the syringe and plunges it into her throat.¬†I see Mama freeze up at the sight of that before she swears in disbelief.

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúJesus Fucking Christ!‚Äù*¬†

Clover has already forced Karla back to the ground. The syringe breaks as they land in the wreckage of the coffee table. Karla‚Äôs landing isn‚Äôt quite as soft as Clover‚Äôs is. She lays sprawled out on her back, hands shaking as she reaches out to touch her throat. Blood gushes out between her fingers.

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúMama‚Ä¶ Mama‚Ä¶?‚Äù* Her voice is shaking and distorted. Clover goes silent. She stares down at Karla, wide eyed and frozen as if she‚Äôs only now just realized what she‚Äôs done. Then she bolts backwards, pushing herself back against the wall.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúW-what did I just‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I was just‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

Karla tries to move. Blood is still gushing out of her neck. Clover must have hit something important‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs trying to apply pressure to the wound but it‚Äôs not enough. She‚Äôs bleeding out too fast. Nobody helps her. Mama Kim remains rooted to the spot, as if she‚Äôs not entirely sure how the hell to react to this. Karla‚Äôs wide, frightened eyes shift toward her and she utters one last word, almost like a plea.

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúMumuh‚Ä¶?‚Äù*

Her body is growing limp. Her breathing is growing shallow and has a wet rasp to it. I can see her wide eyes starting to glaze over. Her body twitches and shudders. Then, just like that she‚Äôs gone.

Nobody says a word. Several seconds pass and it‚Äôs finally Mama Kim who breaks the silence.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do?‚Äù

She‚Äôs looking at Clover now.

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do?!‚Äù*

As she closes the distance between them, Clover can only whimper in fear.

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúPlease Mama, I swear I didn‚Äôt mean to, it was an accident, MAMA PLEASE, NO MAMA! PLEASE!‚Äù*

Mama‚Äôs already grabbed her and forced her to her feet.

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!‚Äù* She demands again. I see her racing for her gun, and I know that Mama Kim would be stupid enough to shoot Clover right then and there.

I know that‚Äôs probably not a bad thing. A bullet to the head will be quick. She won‚Äôt suffer, not like Karla, Victoria and Amanda suffered. Not like Nicky suffered. I know that Clover brought this on herself. Lunging at Karla like that was stupid. Stabbing her, even stupider.¬†But I can‚Äôt let this happen. I can‚Äôt. I feel sick. I can feel the eyes of the dead on me and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I can‚Äôt. *I can‚Äôt.* ***I can‚Äôt!***

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who talked to Vagas!‚Äù*¬†

The words come out of my mouth effortlessly and the silence returns. Mama‚Äôs hand is still on her gun but she hasn‚Äôt taken it out yet. She‚Äôs gone completely stiff. Slowly she turns her head to look at me and watches me pick myself up off the ground.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúD-don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Clover tries to say, but I cut her off.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúPete‚Äôs Auto Repair‚Ä¶‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThe chop shop. They were hiding the drugs in the cars - in the bodies. I heard it from a john‚Ä¶ and I gave it to Vagas.‚Äù

Mama is still staring at me, but after a moment she takes a step back from Clover. A single dry laugh escapes her.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúNo shit?‚Äù She finally asks.

The phone rings again. It‚Äôs the french ringtone, just like last time. Mama stares down at it, then back to me. She smirks but it looks more relieved than triumphant.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúTook you fucking long enough‚Ä¶‚Äù She spits.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take me even longer if you don‚Äôt do exactly what I say,‚Äù I reply. She actually laughs at that.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúPatrice will be here soon, won‚Äôt he?‚Äù I ask. ‚ÄúAnd when he gets here, it‚Äôs going to be your word against mine. I can play dumb if I have to‚Ä¶ we both know he‚Äôs the cautious type. Or did you forget what he did to Alex?‚Äù

Mama hesitates for a moment. I see a flicker of doubt in her eyes.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThink about how this scene is going to look to him,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThree girls dead, one missing a finger and the one who you say was the rat, might just change her story midway through. What would you do?‚Äù

She opens her mouth to speak, but pauss. Then after a moment tries again.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Patrice knows me. I‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúPretty sure he knew Alex too,‚Äù I point out. ‚ÄúYou know, Alex used to work at Pete‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll bet he would‚Äôve made a good rat. But Vagas didn‚Äôt find out about Pete‚Äôs through Alex, did he? He found out through me‚Ä¶ and that didn‚Äôt change the way Alex ended up, did it?‚Äù

Mama doesn‚Äôt reply to that. She‚Äôs quiet for a moment and I see the fear in her eyes. She buries it quickly, but it‚Äôs there.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúLook, we were all fucked the moment I talked to Vagas,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI know that. I knew it when I talked to him, but I‚Äôm throwing you a life line here.

Clover and Adrian‚Ä¶ they get to walk out of this apartment alive. If they do, I‚Äôll talk to Patrice, and maybe you‚Äôll get out of this too.‚Äù

Mama just stares at me. She hasn‚Äôt drawn her gun yet. She seems to think for a moment before she finally speaks again.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs your word against mine, then there‚Äôs no reason for you to actually do what you say if I let them walk. Either way, you‚Äôre dead. And that‚Äôs not even addressing the biggest fucking issue with your little proposition here‚Ä¶ because if I let those two walk, then it won‚Äôt matter what either of us say because then *I‚Äôm* dead. Do you see the problem here?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúThen ask Patrice!‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt ask Patrice for shit!‚Äù* She snaps. *‚ÄúPatrice tells you, not the other fucking way around!‚Äù*¬†

She rubs her temples as she paces for a moment, then glances back at Clover and Adrian. Both have been dead silent. Clover trembling against the wall and Adrian nursing her severed finger.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ‚Ä¶‚Äù Mama says under her breath, before looking back at me.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIf you cooperate‚Ä¶‚Äù She finally says. ‚ÄúThen maybe, *MAYBE* I can convince Patrice to keep the others around. You‚Äôre still going down to the Three of Hearts basement but, you‚Äôll be going alone.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI want you to let them go.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYeah and I wanna fuck Mark Ruffalo! It ain‚Äôt gonna happen!‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúMark Ruffalo‚Ä¶?‚Äù Clover asks quietly. She is ignored.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ the best I can offer them is a chance. Again, *A CHANCE* at survival. That‚Äôs the *only* offer I can possibly fucking make right now, so take it or fucking leave it.‚Äù¬†

I hesitate for a moment, before glancing between Clover and Adrian.¬†Adrian closes her eyes, before giving an uneasy nod. Clover gives me no response at all.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúFine‚Ä¶‚Äù I finally say. Mama lets out a low exhale.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúFine‚Ä¶‚Äù She replies. ‚ÄúNow sit the fuck back down.‚Äù

With that, she pushes past me to pick up her phone. It‚Äôs ringing again. She glares at it before ignoring the call.¬†I go toward Clover, step over Karla‚Äôs corpse and slump down along the wall beside her. For a moment, we don‚Äôt speak. We just watch as Mama Kim pulls up Patrice‚Äôs number and makes a call.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Clover finally asks.

I look over at her.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I was trying to help you‚Ä¶ I was trying to‚Ä¶ Karla‚Ä¶ she was going to‚Ä¶ why would you‚Ä¶?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt, you were going to die,‚Äù I tell her. ‚ÄúThis whole mess‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs on me. I knew how it was going to end and I thought I was ready for it but‚Ä¶‚Äù I can‚Äôt finish that sentence. My gaze shifts over to the corpses of Amanda and Victoria.¬†

Beside me, I feel Adrian coming to join us.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôre probably still gonna die,‚Äù She says, matter of factly.¬†

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù I admit. Truth be told, I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs right but I don‚Äôt want to say it out loud. ‚ÄúBut maybe you‚Äôll get out of this.‚Äù

Adrian nods.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

First of all I was studying to become a better PM rather then pass the pmp but for the last 3 months I'm pushing the tests and mindset. 

Mypreparation was huge: 

1. I watched almost all yt videos that other guys mentioned here
- AR 200 ultra hard questions
- DM 200 agile questions, drag and drop questions, 150 pmbok questions, fast track video and other his videos
- 23 mindset principles MR but its not ideal
- PM aspirant videos (really helpful) 
2. Created my own pmbok with all the information related to project management, its around 20 pages of notes, tools, and techniques.
3. Went through the numerous posts on this forum to create expectations and get some hints. 
4. Pmi SH - passed all test and practise questions, now I have 69% for 770 practise questions and 71% in tests (in the first mock exam I had 110 expert/difficult questions) 

So the time has come, tomorrow is a day X, will go the testing center as many of you recommended, already prepared cold coffee with protein and tic tac to support the brain during the exam. I'm feeling chilled and prepared, mindset is ready, a few hours of preparation today and I'm gonna make it.

1lf9x5d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lf9x5d,Is there a name for this theory? (Last couple slides have sotm spoilers),"So, I‚Äôm a heavy believer that the steelwool era of Fnaf is a massive version of Fnaf world. With certain characters being mentioned, games looking like other games. I started having this obsession with these connections and this theory since John Fuhnaff released his video on ‚ÄúI Solved Security Breach‚Äù, and Into Madness being Security Breach, when it was really meant to be other games like Update 2 of FNAF World, and characters looking like other characters. 

I will elaborate on a couple of these. The blobs proper name is Tangle, the lake in ruin has a red reflection. tangle, Bouncepot, and white rabbit are specifically here because we see them in Ultimate Custom Night. One thing I couldn‚Äôt add was that the Help Wanted 2 credits music is the Fnaf world update 2 hub world theme. Now, the animdude one might be a stretch but Tbf, since Fnaf 3 came out, it was instantly noticed that the map looked a lot like Scott‚Äôs character. So my take on it is as it‚Äôs part of this theory, but of course, Edwin COULD HAVE made the building of Fazbear‚Äôs Fright, but I feel this could be fitting as well. 

A sudden add, all 8 Update 2 characters are in a steelwool game. Coffee appears in help wanted (stay up latte could also be a nod), the jackos in curse of dreadbear, nightmare bb and nightmarionne are obvious, el chips is a knock at chipper, purple guy as William afton is referenced in sotm in some messages, and if my animdude one works out, then yeah that‚Äôs all of them. Also the princess quest ending drawing looks like the image you see when you go down OMCs lake (darn the 20 image limit)

So I‚Äôm really not too sure if others like this theory or really even think about it, but here‚Äôs a couple names for it that I think could be cool

Coffee - 18g
Water - 90g (1:5)
Decoction extract - 55-60g (Around 12-15 mins)
Milk - 112g

Overall the coffee tastes decent, but I am struggling with the leftover coffee grounds. I am left with a very soupy (more pudding like) texture. I basically need to use a spoon to scrape the whole thing and dump it.

Then I relapsed for a few days. I caught myself not even enjoying the games I was playing. I was simply doing it just because I had the free time to do so. I had been ""productive"" throughout my day. Knocked out work, gym, my bible readings, amongst other things. I had this itch of boredom that wouldn't go away. 

What I've realized is that a lot of us including myself run away from those moments of boredom and quiet time because we are scared of the thoughts our mind throws at us. Maybe your life isn't going the way you want it, maybe you're getting over a heart break, maybe you have unhealed trauma. All of these things are contributing factors to A. Addictions and B. Why you and I can't sit still for two seconds without doing something.

For me I've always been the type of person that always has to be doing something. Whether it be working, going to the gym, reading a book, or literally anything that can distract me. It's not nearly as bad as it used to be because I've started meditation and journaling but I still catch myself doing it even after three years of being aware of this. Back then I was running from trauma and trying to cover it in work, self-improvement, and occasionally video games. Because I hated the idea of doing nothing and being ""present"". Every time that happened I would think about the past. Which would just make me pissed. But what I've learned as I've progressively detached further and further away from video games is you don't always have to be doing something.

As gamers all we know is chasing the next objective. Which is why we are always looking up guides, doing something that contributes to the progress of our character, or making sure each and every hour we spend gaming is optimal. Well at least if you're a rpg enjoyer like I was. But what if instead of thinking about how you can do XYZ. You just literally sat down for a second and did nothing? Or go outside for a walk? Maybe go to a coffee shop, grab a coffee, and people watch. Listen to the sounds around you. Become more aware of your environment and what's in it. Will those thoughts your running away from creep in? YES. But let them come. They aren't going to kill you. You'll be ok. If anyone reading this is trying to quit gaming a highly recommend meditation. A very helpful tool for controlling your thoughts and urges.

Video games are cool but they come with a huge cost. Time, which you and I will never get back once it's spent. I'd much rather spend that time present and aware of what's going on in my life than with my face buried into a computer screen only to wake up with half your life gone by. That's how serious this can get. I've been seeing a lot of posts about people's spouses who are addicted to video games. Unfortunately they aren't present enough in their own life to realize how their gaming addiction is affecting other people. People never take gaming as an addiction serious but it actually does affect your relationships heavily. Sure it won't kill your liver like alcohol but it will kill your reward system, attention span, and your ability to be present in the moment. Which is crucial when it comes to relationships and just life in general. 

Your ability to be present directly affects how conscious and aware you are of yourself and the things that are going on around you right now. It's like seeing with glasses that help you see 10x better. ",1,1750336977.0,StopGaming,0,1.0,False

[Paul looked directly at the Sanhedrin and said, ‚ÄúBrothers, I have conducted myself before God in all good conscience to this day.‚Äù ‚Äî Acts 23:1 ](https://preview.redd.it/uz0qbaw4qv7f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90ee0ff45c4a6caad11b604404477cfd037d7bb2)

Conscience alone can sometimes lead us to do wrong. Paul acted according to his conscience when he persecuted Christians. Our conscience needs to be shaped by divine guidance.

Paul probably had every right to protest when the high priest struck him in the face. Yet, we can‚Äôt help but feel that Jesus‚Äô behavior during His trial was nobler. Jesus, when insulted, didn‚Äôt retaliate; when He suffered, He didn‚Äôt threaten, but entrusted everything to God.

Paul‚Äôs apology is an example we should follow if we ever respond in anger. It‚Äôs always honorable to say, ‚ÄúI was wrong‚Äù or ‚ÄúI made a mistake‚Äù when we‚Äôve acted unchristian. Some people are too proud to ever apologize.

Again, we see Jesus as an encourager. After a tough day, Jesus came to Paul with words of comfort, assuring him that he would make it to Rome‚Äîa dream Paul had held for many years.",1,1750336912.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

I started / had my first jab on the 22nd May 2025 (4 weeks to the day)

As of this morning (19th June) I have taken 2 x 2.5mg and a ""5th dose"" of 2.9mg this morning

**Stats**

In those four weeks I have had an incredible loss of 11.5kg (25.4 lbs) which I absolutely accept is at the high end of the experiences on here - I am not ""bragging"" or looking to belittle anyone else's achievements, just an honest update and feedback on my experience to date

Week 1 loss - 6.4 kg

Week 2 loss - 2.1 kg

Week 3 loss - 2.0 kg

Week 4 loss - 1.0 kg

I have been exercising (see below) and can feel muscle growth

  
I have also lost 7.5cm (3"") from around my chest / moobs and 11.5cm (4.5"") from around my ""waist"" level with my belly button / love handles / muffin top territory

¬†**Food Noise**  
The (now its gone, I realise it was) constant noise has completely gone - no urges, even when its there in front of me, or in my hand - psychological / symptom I don't know, but no desire to snack and / or eat sweets / chocolate / bread / carbs / junk food / take aways or in between meals. This was pretty much day 1, literally hours after the first jab

**Suppression**  
Lack of hunger / food suppression has been equally strong / successful but have felt that drop away some days with some ""hunger"" (?) some days. However just (literally) asking myself, ""Am I actually hungry?"" and / or having a glass of water has in most instances made that disappear

There has been, one or two, genuine, instances of actually being hungry

**Water / Hydration**  
I have been drinking around 4 litres of water a day which has helped, massively (I assume) with any hunger and also made me wee like nobody's business !  
I have been taking some High 5 zero tablets in the water which as well as the intended purpose also adds some flavour and the carbination also helps to fill me up

**Food / Meals**  
I have and do swap and change between small meals of the ""normal"" food the rest of the family are eating (sometimes less the more fatty / carby elements) and bulking up on veg etc with larger portions of them

My ""go to"" now which I genuinely really like is 200g/300g of low fat natural / Greek yoghurt with a 35g measure of flavoured protein powder (chocolate / hazelnut / honey comb / cookies and cream) mixed in, sometimes with a Weetabix crushed in for good measure / added fibre. Decent calories / protein balance  
Still having coffee each morning (black freshly ground) as I always have done

My calorie intake is low (maybe too low)

Week one average = 653 Kcal / day

Week two average = 951 Kcal / day

Week three average = 885 Kcal / day

Week four average = 905 Kcal / day

**Exercise**  
I have a gym membership as well as a small home gym, some dumbbells and kettlebells. I am dong 2/3 5min to 1 hour sessions per week of one or a mix of these

I do not include calories ""lost"" in my calorie counts, they are just a bonus

As noted above I can feel the muscle growth and strength and am hoping this will aid with toning and reducing slack skin

Ensuring plenty of protein to help with this and reduce muscle mass loss

**Tracking**  
In my absolute element! - spreadsheets, apps, graphs, bought some smart bathroom scales - and tracking the lot !!  
**BUT**  
I am only measuring and weighing once week, first thing in the morning, same tie, same place for the scales, on jab day

I took my prescription application photos and a set on day 1

A month in I can see the difference on the photos, but not necessarily the full extent ""in real life"" in the mirror until I compare. I will be taking monthly photos and locking them away in my phones private vault

**Side Effects**  
Most weeks the first day or say after my jab I get a headache, paracetamol seems to work, not bad just ""there""

Mouth dryness - constantly, worse on jab day and then tapers off - but certainly helps with flid intake

Coldness! - normally being a human radiator the coldness (full body to the bone) has been the most noticeable and bizarre for me - has been a few days in mainly week three

Constipation - only really started this week (week 4) - two Senna tablets sorted that quick smart but seems to be still here

Bad breath! not sure if its my diet, the coffee and yoghurt, the constipation, the meds or a combination / all of these - but only really started (noticeable) n the last day or so

¬†

**NSVs**  
So many!  
Having to add two new notches on my belt  
Clothes hanging off me  
Clothes I bought, which were too small and i was too embarrassed to take back now fit and look (t me) good!  
Catching a glimpse of myself in a mirror or window and seeing a small difference only I would see  
People commenting I have lost weight on my face  
etc etc

**Generally**  
I already feel like a different person, physically and mentally.  
I am so much happier even just from the eradication of food noise and irrational snacking and over eating

It is like a switch has been flicked and my brain has been rewired, it is sometimes difficult to articulate just how ""happy"" I am, even at this early stage

Sorry for the long and rambling post but hopefully it helps some and it is and has been some mild form of self therapy for me typing this out :)

Yeah, you, the one scrolling through, maybe a little tired of the empty chats and cold replies. I don‚Äôt know if this‚Äôll reach the right person, but I figured it‚Äôs worth a shot.

I‚Äôm 26, from South Asia. Shy in real life, a little awkward at first‚Ä¶ but once I‚Äôm comfortable? I‚Äôm soft, loyal, flirty in the quiet kind of way, like remembering your favorite snack or how you take your coffee, just because I want to make you smile. I‚Äôm the type who‚Äôll send you sweet good mornings and secretly daydream about slow dancing with you in the kitchen at midnight.

I live alone with my mischievous cat, Floki (he might try to steal your spot in bed though, fair warning).
I work in pharma, read way too many thrillers and romance books, and I‚Äôve been known to fall into music rabbit holes for hours.
Languages? I know five. But honestly, I‚Äôd love to learn how to speak your love language too.

I‚Äôm not here for anything casual. I want the deep stuff. Long convos, playful teasing, shared secrets, butterflies that stick around. Someone who‚Äôll flirt with me in the DMs, but also hold space for the quiet moments. If you‚Äôre sweet, kind, maybe a little sassy, that‚Äôs a dangerous combo I‚Äôd love to meet.

So if you‚Äôre done with being just another name on someone‚Äôs list, and you're craving something real (and a little flirty), say hi. Let‚Äôs see where this goes.

P.S. Bonus points if you like cuddles, books, or letting me spoil you just a little üòå",1,1750336611.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

We stopped at a gas station and I  saw one of my students in the back with a group of older guys, smoking weed.

I didn‚Äôt say anything to him in the moment. I just went back to my friend‚Äôs car and jokingly said something like ‚ÄúWow flashback to high school days just saw one of my students getting high out back.‚Äù I laughed but part of me was already thinking about how to handle it.
My friend got serious and said I should call the cops, but I said no. I know his situation. His home life is rough. Calling the police on him wouldn‚Äôt fix anything- it would just make his already difficult life even harder. 
I told her I‚Äôd talk to him at school the following week instead. Also he‚Äôs just a teenager smoking pot, not a violent criminal. I‚Äôve never had any issues with him. He just struggles a bit with reading and writing, which is unfortunately expected given his circumstances.

On Monday, I pulled him aside and asked about that night. He looked embarrassed and said something like, ‚ÄúIt was just to chill out.‚Äù
I told him not to do that kind of stuff in public, especially in the area he lives. And I said if he‚Äôs dealing with stress or problems, he should talk to an adult. He told me he doesn‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to. So I referred him to our school counselor.
I also told him not to mention the weed. Unfortunately, our school has a reputation for drug-testing and disciplining kids from poorer backgrounds way more harshly than others. I‚Äôve seen it too many times‚Äîthey call the cops, do random tests, and it never actually helps. It just pushes kids further down.
He went to the counselor, talked about his family, and later told me it actually felt good to open up. He also said he wants to stop smoking because he doesn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. I told him I didn‚Äôt expect an overnight change, but reminded him that the area he‚Äôs from is heavily policed and kids like him are often targeted.
This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen something like this, and I‚Äôve always tried to handle it with care and empathy.
Yesterday, I brought it up again over coffee with that same teacher friend. She still insisted I should‚Äôve reported him, called him a ‚Äúyouth delinquent,‚Äù and said I was being irresponsible. We got into a bit of an argument.
My husband says I did the right thing. My mom says I should be ashamed of myself.
I don‚Äôt know. All I know is that if I‚Äôd reported him, I doubt it would‚Äôve helped. I just tried to give him a chance instead of a record or an arrest.

1lf9kxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1lf9kxw/aiostreams_v2_is_here_your_stremio_experience/,"AIOStreams v2 is HERE! üéâ Your Stremio Experience, Unified & Supercharged - A Complete Rewrite!","For those who don't know, **AIOStreams** is a Stremio addon I created to let you combine streams from *multiple* Stremio addons into one single, manageable addon. But it's more than just a combiner; AIOStreams is designed to **radically simplify your entire Stremio addon setup.** You provide your Debrid service details (like API keys), and AIOStreams handles the heavy lifting of configuring the stream addons for you. This means you don't have to worry about individual addon configurations or reconfiguring them if an underlying addon updates. It also makes using multiple Debrid services seamless, as AIOStreams can auto-configure them across your chosen addons, ensuring you get the best of all worlds with minimal fuss. It also provides a centralised place for controlling all your sorting and filtering - and already offers more advanced options than other addons.

Previously, AIOStreams was fantastic for getting a Stremio account packed with your favorite *stream* addons up and running in minutes. But I always envisioned it doing more...

I'm absolutely thrilled to announce that **AIOStreams v2 is now LIVE!** For everyone tired of juggling multiple Stremio addons with different settings, quirks, and limits, **v2 is here to turn all of them into a single, unified experience - smarter, faster, and fully in your control.** This isn't just an update; it's a **complete rewrite from the ground up** aimed at making your Stremio life a whole lot easier and more powerful. With v2, AIOStreams can now handle *everything*, not just streams! This was a massive undertaking, allowing me to address **all open bug reports** as well as most feature requests.

# üöÄ The Big Upgrades in v2 üöÄ

* **Beyond Just Streams:** AIOStreams v2 now supports more than just stream addons! You can integrate **any supported Stremio addon type**, including **Catalog addons, Subtitle addons, and even Addon Catalog addons** into your single AIOStreams setup. Now it truly can do *everything*!
* **100% Addon Compatibility:** That's right! AIOStreams v2 is designed to work with **100% of existing Stremio addons** that adhere to the Stremio addon SDK.
* **Sleek New UI**: The entire interface has been redesigned for a more modern, intuitive, and frankly, beautiful configuration experience.

*This new configuration page was only possible thanks to* [*Seanime*](https://seanime.rahim.app)*, a beautiful application for anime*

# ‚ú® Feature Deep Dive - Get Ready for Control! ‚ú®

This rewrite has paved the way for a TON of new features and enhancements. Here‚Äôs a rundown:

**üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Heaven & Built-in Marketplace:**

* The configuration page now features a **built-in marketplace for addons**. This makes it super easy to discover and add new addons, displaying their supported resources (streams, catalogs, subtitles, etc.), Debrid services they integrate with, and stream types (torrent, http, usenet, live etc.).
* You can now **quickly enable or disable individual addons** within your AIOStreams setup without fully removing them. This is particularly useful because tools like StremThru Sidekick wouldn't be able to detect or manage the individual addons *inside* your AIOStreams bundle, but with AIOStreams' own UI, you have that fine-grained control.
* Remember, the marketplace is just there for convenience. You can still add any addon you want using the 'Custom' addon at the top of the marketplace and use an addons manifest URL to add it to AIOStreams.

**üìö Supercharged Catalog Management:**

* **Total Catalog Control:** Reorder your catalogs exactly how you want them, **regardless of which addon they originate from!** Mix and match to your heart's content.
* **Granular Management:** Enable/disable specific catalogs, apply **shuffling** to individual catalogs - and control how long a shuffle lasts, **rename catalogs** for a personalized touch, and you can even **disable certain catalogs from appearing on your Stremio home page**, having them only show up in the Discover section for a cleaner look!
* **Universal RPDB Posters:** Ever wanted those sleek posters with ratings on *any* catalog? Now you can! Apply **RPDB posters (with ratings) to any addon that uses a supported ID type (like IMDB or TMDB ID), even if the original addon doesn't support RPDB itself.**
* **Why not just use other tools like StremThru Sidekick or the Addon Manager for catalogs?**
   * **Broader Compatibility:** Both StremThru Sidekick and Addon Manager are primarily limited to managing addons *for Stremio itself*. AIOStreams‚Äô catalog features can be utilized by *any application* that supports Stremio addons, not just Stremio.
   * **True Internal Reordering:** Neither of those tools supports reordering catalogs *within an addon itself*. Since AIOStreams presents all its combined catalogs as coming from *one addon*, those tools wouldn't be able to reorder the catalogs *inside* your AIOStreams setup. AIOStreams gives you that crucial internal control.
   * **Safety:** AIOStreams does **not** make use of the Stremio API for its core functionality. This means it operates independently and **cannot break your Stremio account** or interfere with its settings.

**üåê Expanded Addon Ecosystem:**

* The built-in marketplace comes packed with **many more addons than before**.
* Some notable new stream addons include: **StremThru Torz, Nuvio Streams, Debridio Watchtower, StreamFusion**, and even built-in support for **wrapping AIOStreams within AIOStreams** (AIOception!).

**üíé Revolutionary Grouping Feature:**

* I've implemented a **new grouping feature** that allows you to group your addons and apply highly customizable conditions.
* Streams from addons in Group 1 are always fetched. Then, you can set conditions for subsequent groups. For example, for Group 2, you could set a condition like `count(previousStreams) < 5`. This means addons in Group 2 will only be queried if the total number of streams found by Group 1 is less than 5. This means you can tell AIOStreams, for instance, to only tap into your backup/slower addon group if your main, preferred addons don't find enough streams first ‚Äì super efficient!
* This allows for incredibly optimized and tailored stream fetching. (For more advanced setups and details, I highly recommend checking out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/wiki/Groups)).

**üîé Next-Level Filtering System:**

* The filtering system has been completely revamped. Previously, you could mainly exclude or prefer. Now, for *every* filter criteria, you can set **four different filter types**:
   * **Include:** If matched, this item won't be excluded by other exclude/required filters for *any other exclude/required filter*.
   * **Required:** Exclude the stream if this criteria is *not* detected.
   * **Exclude:** Exclude the stream if this criteria *is* detected.
   * **Preferred:** This is used for ranking when you use that filter as a sort criteria.
* **New Filters Added:**
   * **Conditions Filter:** This incredibly flexible filter uses the same powerful condition parser as the ""Groups"" feature. You can now enter **multiple filter conditions**, and any stream that matches *any* of the conditions you define will be filtered out. This allows for an almost infinite number of ways to combine filters and exclude streams with surgical precision! For example, a condition like `addon(type(streams, 'debrid'), 'TorBox')` would exclude all Debrid-type streams *only* from the ""TorBox"" addon, leaving its Usenet streams untouched.
   * **Matching:** This powerful filter helps ensure you get the right content. It includes:
      * **Title Matching:** Filter out results that don't match the requested title. You can choose between an ""exact match"" mode or a ""contains"" mode for flexibility. **You can optionally also match the year too.**
      * **Season/Episode Matching:** Specifically for series, this mode filters out results with incorrect season or episode numbers, ensuring accuracy. This can be granularly applied to only specific addons or request types.
   * **Audio Channels:** This was previously part of the Audio Tag filter but is now its own dedicated filter for more precise control (e.g., filter for 5.1, 7.1).
   * **Seeders:** Define include/required/exclude ranges for seeders. Finally, you can set a **minimum seeder count** and automatically exclude results below that threshold!
* **Adjusted & Enhanced Filters:**
   * **Cache:** Get fine-grained control over cached/uncached content. You can now exclude uncached/cached content from specific Debrid services or addons, and even for specific stream types. For example, you could filter out all uncached *torrents* but still allow uncached *Usenet* results.
   * **Clean Results (now ""Deduplicator""):** This is now far more customizable! You can modify what attributes are used to identify duplicates (e.g., infohash, filename) and how duplicates are removed for each stream type. For instance, for cached results, you might want one result from each of your Debrid services, while for uncached results, you might only want the single best result from your highest priority service.
   * **Size:** You can now set **individual file size ranges for each resolution** (e.g., 1-2GB for 720p, 3-5GB for 1080p, etc.).

**üì∫ Smarter Sorting & Display:**

* Define **different sorting priorities for cached vs. uncached media**, and also **different sorting for movies vs. series.**
* **New ""Light GDrive"" Formatter:** For those who prefer a cleaner look but still need key information from the filename, this formatter only shows the title, year, and season/episode info (e.g., ""Movie Title (2023) S01E01""), making sure you don't potentially choose an incorrect result while still keeping the text to a minimal level.
   * And of course, you can always join our Discord server to discover custom display formats shared by the community and easily use them with AIOStreams' custom formatter feature!

**‚ú® Quality of Life Enhancements:**

* **Import/Export Configurations:** You can now easily **export your entire AIOStreams configuration into a file.** This file can then be imported into any AIOStreams instance at any time ‚Äì perfect for backups or migrating to a new setup.
   * **Shareable Templates:** There's an ""Exclude Credentials"" option when exporting, making it easy to share template configurations with others!
   * **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning:** While the ""Exclude Credentials"" feature removes sensitive information you enter *directly* into AIOStreams (like API keys), it **does not** modify or exclude URLs you provide for ""Custom"" addons or when you override an addon's default URL. These URLs can potentially contain sensitive tokens or identifiers, so please review them carefully before sharing a configuration file.
* **External Downloads:** For added convenience, AIOStreams v2 now adds an ""External Download"" link below each stream result. Clicking this will open the direct download link for that stream in your browser, making it easy to grab a copy of the content if needed.
* **Hide Errors:** Optionally hide error messages, and you can even specify this for particular resources (e.g., hide errors only for stream fetching, but show them for catalog fetching).
* **Precache Next Episode:** When you're watching a series, AIOStreams can automatically request results for the *next* episode in the background. If it finds that all available results are uncached, it can **ping the first uncached result for your preferred Debrid service to start downloading it.** The goal? By the time you finish your current episode, the next one might already be cached and ready to stream instantly!

**A Note on Options:** AIOStreams v2 offers a vast array of configuration options, especially within the filtering system. While this provides incredible power and flexibility for advanced users, please remember that **most users won't need to dive deep into every setting.** The default configurations are designed to be sensible and provide a great experience out-of-the-box! For a detailed explanation of every option and how to fine-tune your setup, the [**AIOStreams v2 Configuration Guide**](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/addons/aiostreams) has been fully updated and is your best resource.

# üíæ Under The Hood: The New Database Foundation üíæ

* **Database-Driven:** AIOStreams is now database-based! This means your configurations are stored securely. When you create a configuration, it's assigned a **unique UUID** that you'll use to access it in Stremio.
* **Password Protected:** You'll protect your configurations with a **password**. Without it, no one else can access your configuration.
* **Seamless Updates (Mostly!):** A huge benefit of being database-driven is that for most setting changes, there‚Äôs **no longer a need to reinstall the addon in Stremio!** Just update your configuration, and the changes apply automatically.
   * **Note:** The only exception is if you make changes to your catalogs, or add a type of addon that wasn't previously present (e.g. adding your first subtitle addon) this specific case, a reinstall of the AIOStreams addon in Stremio is needed for Stremio to pick up the resources and catalog order.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Caveats for v2 ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **Migration Requires Reconfiguration:** Due to the extensive changes and the new database system, existing AIOStreams users will need to **reconfigure their setups for v2.** Think of it as a fresh start with a much more powerful system! The [**v1 to v2 Migration Guide**](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/wiki/Migrate-to-V2) on the Wiki can help. For a deep dive into all the new settings, refer to the comprehensive [**AIOStreams v2 Configuration Guide**](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/addons/aiostreams). **If you use custom formatters, you should also check the migration guide for minor syntax adjustments.**
* **Torrentio support (on public instance)?** Torrentio was disabled on AIO for most of v1's history due to the way AIOStreams works (multiple requests appearing to come from one IP, which is problematic for public instances, especially for something like Torrentio that is already being scraped by numerous applications). Torrentio remains **disabled on the official public instance**, and this will not change. Self-hosted instances will have Torrentio enabled by default. The developer of Torrentio has personally stated that he does not want ElfHosted's public instances scraping Torrentio.
* **Cloudflare Worker Support Dropped:** Maintaining compatibility with Cloudflare Workers alongside the new database requirements and feature set became infeasible. It was essentially like writing and maintaining two different versions of the addon. As such, direct Cloudflare Worker support has been dropped. For those of you who currently host V1 with Cloudflare Workers, your instance will continue working and will likely remain working for a long time. You just won't be able to update to V2.
* **Free Hosting Challenges:** AIOStreams v2 now **requires a database** for storing configurations. Many free hosting services do not provide persistent database storage (or have very limited free tiers), which can lead to your configurations being wiped when the instance restarts.
   * For example, **Hugging Face Spaces** requires a paid tier for persistent storage.
   * **Koyeb's** free tier does not offer persistent file storage for the SQLite database, however, Koyeb *does* provide a free PostgreSQL database instance which AIOStreams v2 can use, offering a viable free hosting path if configured correctly.

# üîß Self-Hosting AIOStreams & Self-Hosting Guides üîß

For those of you who like to have full control over your setup, **AIOStreams v2 is, of course,** ***still*** **self-hostable!**

If you're migrating your instance from v1 to v2, read the [Migration](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/wiki/Migrate-to-V2) page on the Wiki to ensure nothing unexpected happens.

A few months back, I started out knowing very little about self-hosting (I was using Hugging Face to host my personal AIOStreams instance back then) and I've since decided to dive into self-hosting.

As a result, I've put together a **set of comprehensive self-hosting guides** that I'm excited to share with the community. My goal with these guides is to take you **from scratch to hosting all sorts of addons and applications**, including AIOStreams, without spending a dime or needing any hardware other than a laptop/computer. (Some of you may even be able to set this all up just using your phone/tablet)

However, I will say that this requires a lot more effort than other options that I previously had guides for like hugging face, render, cloudflare workers etc. but I have done my best to make it as comprehensive as possible.

The guides cover:

* Securing a **free Oracle Cloud VPS**.
* Installing **Docker** and getting comfortable with its basics.
* Utilizing my **highly flexible and detailed template compose project.** This Docker Compose setup is designed to be a launchpad for your self-hosting adventures and includes configurations for **countless apps, with AIOStreams v2 ready to go!**

If you've ever been curious about self-hosting but didn't know where to start, I believe these guides can help you get up and running with a powerful, remote, and secure setup.

1lf9ki5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1lf9ki5/had_bisalp_done_yesterday_germany/,Had bisalp done yesterday (Germany),"I still can't really believe that I'm finally sterile! I (25f, no children) had my bisalp done yesterday (June 18) in Hardheim, Germany. I found the obgyn (GynDoctors) over the map on selbstbestimmt-steril.de and was also glad to note that they already were on the r/childfree list as well.

Hardheim is a bit away from where I live (and *not exactly* a big city lol) but going there really was worth it! From the first phone call on everybody was so nice and there was absolutely no bingo; I was just asked if I knew what it meant to have a bisalp etc. without any judgement. As I came from further away they even offered me to do the op talk the day before surgery and stay the night in one of the apartments that the clinic has for such reasons (2 beds so my mother could come with me). It cost appr. 85‚Ç¨ for both of us.

I gladly took the offer though I didn't expect much from the apartment and was happily surprised it was very nice; modern furnishings, two rooms (bedroom + living room with kitchen + bathroom) an there even was a TV and a dishwasher!

After that I felt positive already and the pre op talk only solidified it. No one judged me; everybody was really nice and we talked about the procedure only; again no bingo. She did a quick ultrasound to see if everything was ok beforehand.

The next morning I had my op and before that a quick talk with the anaesthesist. Again very nice even though I was really nervous by then haha. The surgery went well as well; when I woke up I luckily didn't feel nauseous though a bit loopy but after a few minutes that got better. I was offered cookies and coffee/a coke and gladly munched away on the cookies and drank my coffee. Again, everyone from the hospital staff was so nice; I was really thankful!

The surgeon told me they'd found endometriosis and removed that as well (I'd agreed to that possibility beforehand).

Even though I hadn't brought it up before the op, they gave me my tubes in a jar with formaldehyd and said I could take them with me or they'd dispose them. I chose to take them with me but I'm not sure yet if I want to keep them or throw them away eventually haha. Regardless, it felt good seeing the removed tubes to be really sure they are gone.

When I felt good enough and had peed once (to make sure the anaesthesia hadn't messed with that) they called my mother to get me. Here it got a bit complicated because we'd arrived by train/bus and my father would only arrive in the afternoon to drive us home by car. Thankfully, they allowed us to stay in the apartment till then! I'm really glad about that; it meant I could lie down on a bed for a bit as I was feeling exhausted; also the weather was hot outside and it was cooler in the apartment.

They didn't prescribe me any pain medication but said I could take ibuprofen when I needed it (no prescription needed to buy that). I did; thankfully I had taken some with me when packing. The pain was manageable with that even when the pain medication from the surgery started to fade.

The car drive home ended up being 3 hours long thanks to traffic jam on the Autobahn and I was really, really glad I'd bought a star shaped hysterectomy pillow beforehand to go under the seatbelt. It was definitely worth it and helped a lot. (I also learned to appreciate well-maintained roads more that before as I became very aware of uneven ground and potholes lol.) I was also thankful we had water and snacks in the car (the clinic in Hardheim is on the small side and doesn't have a cafeteria and there aren't many opportunities to eat out in Hardheim as well haha). We ate dinner when we arrived at home.

As of now (one day after surgery) I'm feeling relatively well; I took more ibuprofen last evening/during the night and the pain (in my belly as well as the gas pain) has been manageable. I read that for some people the pain was the worst on day three though so maybe it will get worse. We'll see.

I normally sleep on my belly and bought a wedge pillow beforehand for sleeping on my back which was so worth it! It really helped last night. I got a side sleeping pillow as well but haven't used it yet; I didn't feel comfortable to turn on my side last night. I also bought an electronic heat pad for my back/shoulders (not for sleeping tho).

They advised me to not use stool softeners but use natural stuff like died fruit if I felt constipated. I'm going to drink prune juice and eat muesli bars/those squeeze pouches with applesauce and see if it works. I have stool softener here though in case it doesn't. I hope I won't need it but we'll see ugh.

The surgery cost 1250‚Ç¨ which was definitely worth it!!

I can't think of anything else to write rn and this has gotten long enough anyway haha. To everyone who managed to read through this far: Have a great day! (And to those who didn't as well!)",4,1750336124.0,sterilization,2,0.84,False

# Order Notes

At the beginning of *It‚Äôs Your Funeral*, Six is still emotionally distant from the rest of the Village. His contempt for the other Villagers is on full display throughout the prior episode, and this dynamic carries over here. That changes when a young woman‚ÄîMonique, the watchmaker‚Äôs daughter‚Äîapproaches him for help. She saw him successfully stand up to a Two and thinks he might be the only person capable of stopping a dangerous plot.

At first, Six dismisses her with the same hostile disdain he‚Äôs shown toward everyone else. But when he sees her being drugged by Two‚Äôs forces, his stance softens. He remains wary, but he begins to take her seriously. Eventually, he‚Äôs convinced that the threat she describes is real: a bomb plot that will assassinate the retiring Number Two during the Village‚Äôs ‚ÄúAppreciation Day‚Äù ceremony.

Many fans criticize this episode‚Äôs plot as needlessly elaborate, and the sitting Number Two‚Äîplayed by Derren Nesbitt‚Äîseems to agree. He questions why Six has to be involved and suggests a simpler course of action, but is overruled by a voice on the yellow phone, representing an unseen higher authority. This leads to a key reinterpretation: the scheme isn‚Äôt his. It‚Äôs being orchestrated from above.

In this reading, the real objective isn‚Äôt the death of the retiring Number Two‚Äîit‚Äôs psychological manipulation of Six. The authorities are testing him by giving him a threat he can stop. If he succeeds, they get to feed his ego and encourage a sense of connection to the Village as a community. If he fails, they have regret and guilt to exploit instead. Either way, the emotional aftermath becomes a tool.

Six does save the day, and the plan fails‚Äîbut that outcome may have been exactly what the Powers That Be intended. For once, he isn‚Äôt fighting the community or lashing out in anger. He‚Äôs acting in defence of others. And when he smugly confronts Number Two at the end, there‚Äôs a real sense of satisfaction on his face. But that self-satisfaction is itself a trap. His apparent victory isn‚Äôt necessarily his own‚Äîit may be another carefully engineered manipulation, designed to draw him closer to the very system he wants to escape.

# SYNOPSIS

# Act One

Number 50 goes to Six‚Äôs cottage, where she finds the door ajar. She enters. In the Control Room the Supervisor is watching and says, ‚ÄúAt last.‚Äù

50 finds Six in bed, apparently asleep. Making no attempt to wake him verbally and without so much as a polite cough, she creeps up to him and touches his arm. He grabs her and asks, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù She says she needs his help, but he thinks she‚Äôs working for the Village and refuses. She promptly collapses.

50 comes to. Six realizes she was drugged. He agrees to hear her out, but with skepticism. She tells him she needs his help to prevent an assassination. There would be reprisals and everybody would suffer. She can‚Äôt warn the Village of the threat because she‚Äôs a Jammer so she‚Äôs on the Village‚Äôs ‚ÄúDo Not Believe‚Äù list. Offended by Six‚Äôs disbelieving and rude behavior, she leaves.

Two and the Supervisor watch from Control. A yellow phone rings for Two. Yellow Phone Guy is unhappy that the plan is running late. Two suggests leaving Six out of the plan but YPG overrules him.

Two asks for the daily activities prognosis on Six. The prognosis lists everything that Six is going to do the next day.

* **6:30 AM** Takes a walk, climbs bell tower
* **7:30 AM** Works out at personal gym
* **8:15 AM** Waterskis
* **9:00 AM** Has coffee at cafe and buys newspaper
* **9:20 AM** Plays chess with senior; wins in 11 moves; sits for portrait by other senior

# Act Two

In the Green Dome, Number 100 assures Two that Plan Division Q is proceeding well.

Six is sitting for the portrait and the artist is telling Six about Jamming‚Äîbasically crying wolf until nobody believes you any more. The Village keeps a list of whom not to believe.

In the Green Dome, Six‚Äôs activities prognosis is read to Two. It is presently 10:19 AM.

* **10:20 AM** Buys newspaper, bar of soap, bag of sweets

Two doesn‚Äôt believe it. Six never eats candy. But when an old woman can‚Äôt get sweets because her week‚Äôs credit is used up, Six buys them for her. Two is duly impressed.

* **10:45** Chess with 82
* Between **11:40** and **11:50**, arrives at gym for kosho

Two has found what he wants. While Six plays kosho, 100 surreptitiously replaces his watch with a stopped one.

After the game, Six discovers that his watch is stopped, so he goes to the watchmaker‚Äôs shop. While the watchmaker is in the back fixing the watch, Six discovers that the watchmaker has a device to detonate explosives by radio. When Six leaves, 100 emerges from hiding and congratulates the watchmaker. Outside, Six runs into 50. Turns out, she‚Äôs the watchmaker‚Äôs daughter.

At the Green Dome, Two tells 22 that the plan is going well. 22 is not pleased: ‚ÄúWhatever you like to call it, Plan Division Q is still murder.‚Äù Two tells him to keep his mouth shut and do his job. Soon Six will come to the Green Dome to warn Two that an assassination is planned and that Two is the intended victim.

# Act Three

Six asks 50 about the assassination her father is planning. She tells him that Two is the intended victim. Another man is involved but she doesn‚Äôt know who. That‚Äôs all she knows. They go to her father‚Äôs shop and try in vain to talk him out of it. He says he‚Äôs doing it for the sake of principle. He says he hopes the inevitable crackdown will provoke people to fight back. (Hi, Luthen!)

Six goes to the Green Dome to warn Two. Two says he doesn‚Äôt believe it. He says Jammers can‚Äôt Jam once they‚Äôre on the list, so the Jammers are using Six to Jam by proxy. They have a bit of a row, but Two remains unconvinced. After Six leaves, Two verifies that cameras and audio recorded everything.

Six talks to 50 at a concert. The PA announces that the day after tomorrow is Appreciation Day.

That night, after the watchmaker‚Äôs shop is closed, Six and 50 enter it. There they find an Appreciation Day medallion for Number Two, hollowed out and packed with explosives.

Six returns to the Green Dome, where he discovers a new Number Two. This guy is identified in the credits as ‚ÄúRetiring Number Two,‚Äù so we‚Äôll call him R2. R2 doesn‚Äôt believe Six‚Äôs warning. He shows him footage that looks like Six warning a lot of Twos about impending assassinations. Six tells him that the footage has been doctored.

R2 also explains his role in Appreciation Day. He‚Äôs a former Two who‚Äôs retiring, and was returned to the office so he could retire as a Two, after which he will transfer the reins back to Nesbitt‚Äôs Two, at the Appreciation Day ceremony.

At the caf√©, 50 recognizes her father‚Äôs co-conspirator (Number 100) at another table and identifies him to Six. Six recognizes 100 as a collaborator with Nesbitt‚Äôs Two‚ÄîI‚Äôll just keep calling him Two‚Äîand puts Two and Two together: it‚Äôs Two arranging the hit on R2.

In the Green Dome, R2 tells Number 22 to send someone to the Bureau of Visual Records to get the original footage of Six‚Äôs meeting with Two. 22 tells him that there is no such footage. R2 asks how 22 would know that and 22 can‚Äôt answer. R2 says that‚Äôs all the answer he needs. (Considering 22‚Äôs expressed moral reservations about the plan, I wonder if his screwup here is intentional.) Meanwhile, Two talks to Yellow Phone Guy and assures him that everything is proceeding according to plan.

Six returns to the Green Dome and describes to R2 how the assassination will be carried out. R2 says there‚Äôs no point in resisting because ‚ÄúWe never fail.‚Äù Meanwhile, Two again reassures YPG that the plan is going fine.

During the Appreciation Day ceremony, Two contacts 100 by radio, and 100 assures him that everything is fine. The watchmaker is in a tower, overlooking the ceremony with binoculars. Six and 50 see him and run to him.

The medallion is placed on R2, but 50 and Six get to the watchmaker in time to prevent him from triggering the detonator. When the explosion doesn‚Äôt occur, Two tells 100 to find out what‚Äôs going on.

Six leaves the tower with the detonator, only to run into 100, who demands Six hand it over. They scrap. While they are fighting, the medallion is transferred from R2 to Two. Six defeats 100, dashes to the ceremony, and gives the detonator to R2.

Two spots the detonator in R2‚Äôs hands. When he tries to approach R2, R2 threatens to detonate the explosive‚Äîwhich Two is now wearing‚Äîso Two backs off.

Six prevents Two from removing the medallion. R2 reaches the helicopter and makes his escape. Six looks chuffed. Two decidedly doesn‚Äôt.

# END SYNOPSIS

¬†

# Things to Think On

The plan is designed to fail. Not only is bringing Six into it in the first place giving him a chance to defeat it, but why station the watchmaker overlooking the ceremony where Six can see him? Why not just tell him by radio when it‚Äôs time to go boom?

If the actual plan really were to stage an assassination as a pretext for a crackdown, preventing the assassination would only delay it a little. An organization like the Village can always find or manufacture another pretext.

In the end, Two believes he has been defeated. However, if my speculation in the Order Notes is correct, then things actually worked out exactly as the people giving Two the orders desired. Afterwards, I wonder, do they tell him he played his part perfectly and give him credit? Or do they just let him go on thinking he failed?

Derren Nesbitt once said he was [acting in the dark](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingInTheDark). He didn‚Äôt know the show and didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. Turns out, his character was in the same situation, following orders without knowing all the whys and wherefores. Also turns out, Nesbitt did a good job. Also also turns out, so did Two.

Six buying sweets for the old lady is a random act of kindness the like of which we don‚Äôt otherwise see in the series, from P or from anyone. (‚ÄúMrs. Butterworth‚Äù might seem to qualify at first, but that turns out to be phoney.)

Two and 100 may exhibit the worst behavior we‚Äôve seen in the series so far. Not to excuse those responsible for the lobotomies of 46 and 60, the brainwashings of Six and Eight, the obedience training of Rook, or whatever they did to Dutton‚Äîbut these two are plotting murder and spend much of the episode gloating about it on screen.

22, on the other hand, is an unusual type: the villain with a conscience. He‚Äôs working with Two on Plan Division Q, but he has moral reservations. (I appreciate his subtle irony: sure, it‚Äôs murder‚Äîbut think of the performance review!) When his mistake alerts R2 to the conspiracy, is it really a mistake, or is it sabotage?

The activity prognoses‚Äîthose are generated by The General, right?

Cheating is never excusable I'm not trying to excuse myself. What I did is unforgivable but I think the context of our relationship is an important factor. I just need to get this off my chest as I've never told anyone.

2 years in
He flirted with his ex behind my back. He felt so guilty and told me a few days/ a week later. He was sobbing and saying he was going to carve my name into himself and I had to beg him not to and try calm him down tell him it was ok.

3 years in
Found messages to 3 women in Reddit saying how hot they were and trying to flirt with them. Confronted him immediately and he said he didn't do it someone must have hacked his account he's never seen them before etc. eventually started crying saying he was being accused of something he hadn't done so I dropped it and forgave him instantly because I thought I was falsely accusing him.

5 years in 
Pushed and pushed for us to be poly when I was very unsure and uncomfortable. He said it was either that or he'd kill himself so I felt like I had to and it wouldn't be as bad as losing him. 
Him going to see a Jess was horrendous. I literally felt like I was being cheated on right to my face and the worst part was there's nothing I can do about it. I did this to myself I said this was okay. I can't take it back because he'll probably kill himself. And he was so happy, that was the happiest I've seen him in years was when he was getting attention from and fucking someone else and it absolutely destroyed me, I felt so suicidal for months and months. I had an unjust burning hatred for her that persisted for years after they stopped seeing eachother. I still kind of hate her I know I shouldn't.

He invited a girl over without telling me and spent the night with her. I found out when I turned up at his house as planned the next day he opened the door and said ""oh Alice's here btw"" then she was immediately in front of me. I ran upstairs and cried until she left. He claims he told me but he absolutely didn't or I wouldn't have been so shocked.
This whole time I never saw anyone on my own. I wanted to so it felt more fair and maybe I'd understand how he was feeling if I also saw someone. He didn't mind me seeing women but if I even mentioned even going to get a coffee with a man he would freak out. Sobbing and screaming that he's not enough, I should just leave him already and go be with this other guy until I would say okay I'm not going. He said multiple times I was allowed to see men but every time I even mentioned meeting a man he'd meltdown so I never did.

He has generally been abusive when he's mentally unwell through almost out while relationship. This has included: threatening to kill me, threatening to kill my family, threatening to out me to my family, threatening to hurt my animals, threatening to burn the house down, saying I deserve to die because I'm disabled, trying to kick me out the house in the middle of the night in all kinds of weather, throwing and breaking objects, waving weapons around, being horrible to make me break up with him so he can kill himself, calling me names, insulting me, insulting and making fun of stuff I like, berating me for hours and breaking down my world views and values for over 9 hours at night when I have work in the morning, begging me to let him kill himself already and asking why I'm torturing him by making him be here, and that I need to tell him that he can die it's okay and so much more I can't even remember right now 

The most recent really bad thing was when he was really drunk he said got on top of me pinning me to the bed and wrapped his hands round my neck. He didn't squeeze at all but his hands were around my neck and I couldn't move. I shouted at him to get off of me and he wouldn't. I tried to pull his hand off and he restrained me with his other hand. I managed to get one of my legs underneath him and kicked him so hard in the chest. He was drunk so he stumbled backwards and knocked loads of stuff everywhere. I started crying and he looked at me like I was crazy and said he was just joking. When I've brought it up later he's apologised and said he doesn't remember but I do I honestly feel scared of him still because of that I know he's capable of that now. This happened 3 weeks before I cheated.

7 years in
I went out drinking to meet a friend of 3 years that I'd never met. I don't remember but he told me later he kissed me. I remember kissing him and he asked if we could go back to the hotel, I said yes and I don't really remember much more than that I know we had sex. That whole night my bf was really worried about me trying to get in contact with me and I wouldn't answer my phone or I'd hang up. He thinks I was doing this deliberately as I was cheating on him but I literally don't remember at all I really don't think I was doing it deliberately I was probably too drunk to use my phone I barely remember anything. After that I continued to sext and flirt with him for 2 months. I knew it was wrong but I did it because it made me feel good. That's the ultimate selfish reason behind it. Due to how he's treated me I felt generally unsafe, scared and like I had already been betrayed by him over and over for years. My trust and boundies had already been repeatedly violated for the past 5 years. I felt like I deserved to feel good for once, he gets to go around fucking people and feeling happy whilst also stopping me from seeing any men how is that fair. I wanted to tell him but I thought he might kill himself ofc so I didn't which I know is cowardly. He saw my phone and found out and confronted me 3 months ago. I feel awful I feel like I'm the most disgusting person ever. I feel evil and abusive. I would do anything to undo it. I literally feel like I deserve to die for what I've done and I don't know how to feel any better about it. It's completely consuming me.

If anyone even reads this I know they will say to break up but I can't. I love him too much and he'll definitely kill himself. That's why I've never told anyone because I know I won't be able to follow through on their advice. I just wanted to say it even if no one sees.

And then... the truth hit hard.,"Hey everyone i want to share something which happen recently with me and created a deep impact on me mentally. For some people maybe it is just a normal thing and there is nothing to worry about. For context I am an introvert kind of guy got bullied lot in school and rejected many times as i was super skinny. For 2-3 years i locked in myself and focus solely on my career and gym, grooming and all. Recently there is a girl in my gym she joined a month back. She and I use to have eye contacts continuous back and forth. Mostly she is the one who initiate it . For  months I ignore tell myself things like oh you should focus on yourself in gym and stuff like that. I  thought maybe we are in tier 3 city and if i go like that things can wrong so i waited but not realized i have given lot of attachment to it. . One day I just say hi to her . She spoke nicely. Later on for 3-4 days same things goes on we talk. Finally  day arrive I ask her for coffee . To which she replied with a smile ok . And then there was a shocking thing happen to me she told she have a boyfriend and she is really sorry for giving wrong signals in first place . I just told her no issues .She gave me  compliment for my physique . She told we can be friends . And I replied ya sure . But from next day onwards things got so awkward and  again those eye contacts. Now her boyfriend(i am not sure her friend or boyfriend) also join gym . Now I am trying to avoid any eye contact with her. She still try to hold an eye contact or look at me when i perform my sets but i am trying to avoid her. I am not blaming her not me . I approach with full honesty no game nothing. I attach so much feelings and thoughts for month that result me in heartbreak. But in this whole incident i got spiritually more connected. The type of relationship , love i want in my life . I am now patiently waiting and believe universe will shower me with love very soon.

This downgrader downgrades the game to the v1.0 US version and there is no 'hot coffee' minigame.

So, I read a couple of forums which seemed to talk only about the physical copy of the game. And I guess  there is no such thing as a digital PC copy of GTA SA that includes this minigame.

Last year, [Go High Level](https://honeysyed.com/gohighlevel) bought me a Porsche Taycan.

I‚Äôm so grateful.

But, to be honest with you‚Ä¶ I would never consider a car like this, if I had to pay for it myself. I am not a flashy guy. I bought a ""posh"" glass-top underground wine cellar for my 40th, but I don‚Äôt drink anymore - D‚Äôoh!

I like sharing delicious food and exotic holidays with my friends and family.

I really savour my flat white coffee every morning from my swish La Marzocco machine. But I can‚Äôt think of what else from the ‚Äòmaterial‚Äô world I need? If I did like to SPEND though, How fun would it be to explore? What kind of ride could DBR with AI put in your driveway? Paid for in cash!

‚Ä¶ exactly how many old leads would the client need to have? Dunno for sure without knowing your numbers? But‚Ä¶ here's some results from the top of my files for ya...

(These are from different clients and niches running ""Sleeping Beauty"" DBR with AI campaigns.)

One HVAC client - $17,500 per month lead package combined with our ‚Äòspeed to lead‚Äô Android, signed as soon as they saw a DEMO

One Debt Consolidation client - ¬£60K from a ‚Äòdead‚Äô database, plus ongoing performance-based deal to replace their call center.

One client handed over $100K ""up front"" for the idea alone.

So, now you can see, even with a small biz like HVAC there may be a fun new car in there.

If you're shootin' for the new Porsche Taycan? Well, maybe you'd need to land 2 or 3 ""DBR + AI"" clients? Don't forget ol' Uncle Sam.

When my wife Emily wanted her 7-seater ""weekend football taxi"" to run our kids and their friends around, I just said yes to another AI client.

(I do the choosing these days)

What kind of car could a single ""DBR + AI"" client pay for you? Don't know if you've considered it?

If you're thinking, ""I don‚Äôt know how to do the tech, or I'm just not good enough at sales to crank out a brand new car.""

I feel you, that's what nearly all of my peeps say before they get on their first coffee date demo. 

**That‚Äôs exactly why I put together the Survive to Thrive Playbook.**

Inside, I‚Äôll show you 5 easy ways to make serious money with AI, even if you‚Äôre brand new.

[Grab your copy here](https://honeysyed.com/flexxable)

Then the magic happens.

Once I give them the strategy, templates, prompts and case studies, they go off and crank out 10 coffee dates and 10 new clients which could completely pay off a fun new ride if they wished.

Hey, let me rub some shiny off...

‚Ä¶ sometimes we mess it up.

‚Ä¶ it happens

... One of my failures only brought in ¬£3K on a database of 360 leads and then they didn't want to go again.

But, that's still a used car, right? Maybe you're not in the market for a new ride? I dunno?

My daughter is about to enter her second year of private school. Any guesses on how I might pay for it?",1,1750335503.0,AiChampions,0,1.0,False
1lf9cnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lf9cnb/i_cheated_in_my_7_year_relationship_and_its/,I cheated in my 7 year relationship and it's destroying me,"
Cheating is never excusable I'm not trying to excuse myself. What I did is unforgivable but I think the context of our relationship is an important factor. I just need to get this off my chest as I've never told anyone.

2 years in
He flirted with his ex behind my back. He felt so guilty and told me a few days/ a week later. He was sobbing and saying he was going to carve my name into himself and I had to beg him not to and try calm him down tell him it was ok.

3 years in
Found messages to 3 women in Reddit saying how hot they were and trying to flirt with them. Confronted him immediately and he said he didn't do it someone must have hacked his account he's never seen them before etc. eventually started crying saying he was being accused of something he hadn't done so I dropped it and forgave him instantly because I thought I was falsely accusing him.

5 years in 
Pushed and pushed for us to be poly when I was very unsure and uncomfortable. He said it was either that or he'd kill himself so I felt like I had to and it wouldn't be as bad as losing him. 
Him going to see a Jess was horrendous. I literally felt like I was being cheated on right to my face and the worst part was there's nothing I can do about it. I did this to myself I said this was okay. I can't take it back because he'll probably kill himself. And he was so happy, that was the happiest I've seen him in years was when he was getting attention from and fucking someone else and it absolutely destroyed me, I felt so suicidal for months and months. I had an unjust burning hatred for her that persisted for years after they stopped seeing eachother. I still kind of hate her I know I shouldn't.

He invited a girl over without telling me and spent the night with her. I found out when I turned up at his house as planned the next day he opened the door and said ""oh Alice's here btw"" then she was immediately in front of me. I ran upstairs and cried until she left. He claims he told me but he absolutely didn't or I wouldn't have been so shocked.
This whole time I never saw anyone on my own. I wanted to so it felt more fair and maybe I'd understand how he was feeling if I also saw someone. He didn't mind me seeing women but if I even mentioned even going to get a coffee with a man he would freak out. Sobbing and screaming that he's not enough, I should just leave him already and go be with this other guy until I would say okay I'm not going. He said multiple times I was allowed to see men but every time I even mentioned meeting a man he'd meltdown so I never did.

He has generally been abusive when he's mentally unwell through almost out while relationship. This has included: threatening to kill me, threatening to kill my family, threatening to out me to my family, threatening to hurt my animals, threatening to burn the house down, saying I deserve to die because I'm disabled, trying to kick me out the house in the middle of the night in all kinds of weather, throwing and breaking objects, waving weapons around, being horrible to make me break up with him so he can kill himself, calling me names, insulting me, insulting and making fun of stuff I like, berating me for hours and breaking down my world views and values for over 9 hours at night when I have work in the morning, begging me to let him kill himself already and asking why I'm torturing him by making him be here, and that I need to tell him that he can die it's okay and so much more I can't even remember right now 

The most recent really bad thing was when he was really drunk he said got on top of me pinning me to the bed and wrapped his hands round my neck. He didn't squeeze at all but his hands were around my neck and I couldn't move. I shouted at him to get off of me and he wouldn't. I tried to pull his hand off and he restrained me with his other hand. I managed to get one of my legs underneath him and kicked him so hard in the chest. He was drunk so he stumbled backwards and knocked loads of stuff everywhere. I started crying and he looked at me like I was crazy and said he was just joking. When I've brought it up later he's apologised and said he doesn't remember but I do I honestly feel scared of him still because of that I know he's capable of that now. This happened 3 weeks before I cheated.

7 years in
I went out drinking to meet a friend of 3 years that I'd never met. I don't remember but he told me later he kissed me. I remember kissing him and he asked if we could go back to the hotel, I said yes and I don't really remember much more than that I know we had sex. That whole night my bf was really worried about me trying to get in contact with me and I wouldn't answer my phone or I'd hang up. He thinks I was doing this deliberately as I was cheating on him but I literally don't remember at all I really don't think I was doing it deliberately I was probably too drunk to use my phone I barely remember anything. After that I continued to sext and flirt with him for 2 months. I knew it was wrong but I did it because it made me feel good. That's the ultimate selfish reason behind it. Due to how he's treated me I felt generally unsafe, scared and like I had already been betrayed by him over and over for years. My trust and boundies had already been repeatedly violated for the past 5 years. I felt like I deserved to feel good for once, he gets to go around fucking people and feeling happy whilst also stopping me from seeing any men how is that fair. I wanted to tell him but I thought he might kill himself ofc so I didn't which I know is cowardly. He saw my phone and found out and confronted me 3 months ago. I feel awful I feel like I'm the most disgusting person ever. I feel evil and abusive. I would do anything to undo it. I literally feel like I deserve to die for what I've done and I don't know how to feel any better about it. It's completely consuming me.

If anyone even reads this I know they will say to break up but I can't. I love him too much and he'll definitely kill himself. That's why I've never told anyone because I know I won't be able to follow through on their advice. I just wanted to say it even if no one sees.

TLDR: I cheated on my partner after several issues in our relationship and I don't think I can ever forgive myself ",1,1750335487.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

One minute, you're chilling, maybe sipping your coffee, and the next? BAM! Your heart‚Äôs doing a drum solo in your chest, your breath's trying to break records for fastest pace, and your muscles are tighter than your jeans after Thanksgiving dinner. It‚Äôs like your body suddenly gets the memo that you‚Äôre freaking out even if your mind is still processing what‚Äôs happening.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs not just in your head. Anxiety doesn‚Äôt just send a text saying, ""Hey, I‚Äôm here!"" Oh no, it sends a full-on physical entourage. Tight chest? Check. Dizziness? Check. That weird feeling like you‚Äôre about to fall through the floor even though you're standing still? Big check. Anxiety gets *creative* with how it wants to show up.

But here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs just your body reacting to a trigger. It‚Äôs like your internal alarm system going off... for no good reason, obviously. So next time you feel the anxiety ninja coming through, remember that it‚Äôs not trying to sabotage you... it‚Äôs just trying to get your attention. And trust me, it‚Äôs really good at it.

So, how do you deal with it? Well, learning how to manage those physical symptoms can help you disarm it. Deep breathing, grounding techniques, or even just laughing at how ridiculous the whole situation feels because let‚Äôs be honest, anxiety‚Äôs a little extra sometimes.
