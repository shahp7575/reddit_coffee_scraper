Should I have asked?","So I (31f) was getting to know this girl (30f) who I met on Hinge. We met maybe 4 times and were discussing dating, I was just shy and wanted to get to know her and have a few specific conversations first which I did communicate when we first met. In that time, we were texting a lot, taking interest in each other’s interests, etc. She was flirting, and had made me a playlist titled with my name and several songs that felt very intentionally romantic, lots of lyrics implying that I needed to hurry up and make a move. I made one for her in response with some romance implied as well. After a couple weeks we were supposed to meet up and I intended to tell her I was developing feelings, I had felt the spark and wanted to kiss her the last hangout but missed my chance. She texted me beforehand to let me know she had met someone else and was going a different direction. I let her know I had intended to ask her out, and we had a very sweet open conversation where in we agreed to be friends and were happy for each other. No big deal, I’m glad it happened before I got attached even more. We ended up fizzling out though, she started flaking out a lot, and I pulled away entirely because I thought maybe she was just being polite and didn’t really want to be friends. 

Fast forward: it’s been a year and a half. In that time I’ve wondered how she’s doing a few times, once noticed my playlist for her still had a following and added more songs to it in hopes she’d noticed. Then moved on and forgot. 
My roommate recently moved our Spotify Family Plan to Tidal to avoid all the AI takeover. This past Monday I was transferring playlists etc I noticed the playlist she made me had WAY more songs. Immediately opened it, and the last song was a very recent Hayley Williams song so it had to have been updated in the last month. I texted her. We’ve been checking in and making plans to meet up, and it was only just last night mentioned in passing that she’s in a relationship. 

Here’s my issue: I’m glad that it was mentioned and I’m not upset that she’s in a relationship, I’m happy for her and still totally fine just being friends. I think she’s a very sweet person and I don’t want to think it’s intentional. 
I just feel anxious and unsure now.. In the screenshots I told her immediately that I texted her because of the playlist, and she admits to it.. It just seems like something that should have been brought up sooner than a week. Is this on me for assuming it was implied that I reached out because of romantic memories and feelings..? Should I confront her about it or just leave it be and move on?",2,1763920890.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

1p4tb66,https://i.redd.it/hggbj5m6q13g1.jpeg,[MoonSwatch] I wanted a Speedy. My wrist wanted a MoonSwatch.,"Ok, quick story. I’m sure some of you will disagree… that’s fine. This is just how it went for me.

A few years back I walked into the Omega boutique in Santiago with my wallet ready. I’d been wanting a Speedmaster for a long time, so this was the moment to finally try it on properly. The experience was honestly great. They treated me really well, no Rolex mind games fuckery. And yeah, the Speedy is iconic for a reason. But the second I felt the weight, I thought… wow, this thing is a tank.

I’m used to thin, light watches, so I couldn’t see it as a daily… more like a rotation piece. And I had this gut check. So I thanked the guy and said, ‘it’s gorgeous, but let me sleep on it.’

A couple of weeks later, Speedy still in my head, after coffee with a friend, we walked past a Swatch store and I went in. This was about six months after the MoonSwatch launch circus. In Chile there weren’t crazy lines. They brought very few at first, sold out fast, then quietly restocked. When I bought mine the store was empty. Super low key.

I tried it on and felt two things right away.
	•	Huge difference in comfort.
	•	Not a huge difference in the experience I’d actually get out of it.

Yes, the Speedy is a better watch. Mechanically, materially, historically… all of it. I’m not here to argue that. I just didn’t want to buy it to satisfy some unspoken ‘collector checklist’ of watches you’re supposed to own… just for the sake of it.

Also, for me, admiring a watch and owning it aren’t the same thing. I love A. Lange, for example… but if I actually owned one, I’m pretty sure I’d just stare at it in its box and never know when to wear it. And if that’s the relationship I’m going to have with a watch, I’d rather take that money and go on an unreal trip around the world… or, I don’t know, do something good for someone.

Anyways, back to why the MoonSwatch worked for me. I wanted the Speedy look without forcing something heavy into my daily life. And honestly, the version I was close to buying has a solid caseback anyway, so I wasn’t going to be staring at a movement anyways. Sure, the Swatch hand doesn’t sweep like the real thing… but 🤷🏻‍♂️… it still gives me a stupid little smile when I put it on. And when it got a few hairlines, I took it in and they polished it for free. Same with the battery. That makes it even easier for me to love the thing.

And yeah… funny thing is, a while later I even started feeling the MoonSwatch was kind of big and busy for me. My taste just drifted to smaller stuff over time. Then I picked up a Cartier Tank and ended up wearing it almost every day. Looking back, this whole story was just me choosing comfort first from the start.

Why am I posting this now?
Because after months of barely touching it, I threw it back on this week and went, ‘yep… still fun, still comfy, still makes sense.’

I still can’t wrap my head around Swatch Group here. It’s hilarious, insane, kind of genius… and somehow still misunderstood. They made a cheap little Speedy shaped gizmo that can steal wrist time from the real icon. If I hadn’t tried this thing, I might’ve eventually gone back for the ‘forever’ Speedy… heck, I still ponder it from time to time.

Anyway… big conglomerates do weird shit. I’m just here enjoying the chaos.

That’s it. Not a hot take… just me, dumping my watch overthinking somewhere.",6,1763920808.0,Watches,3,0.8,False

I’ve read about startups working on lab-grown coffee and cocoa, which could really help the environment. But the more I read, the more I realize how energy-intensive it still is. If that energy isn’t clean, are we really helping? And since most growth media come from crops like corn or sugarcane, it still creates an environmental trade-off. I’m hopeful, though. Some newer ideas like algae-based materials and renewable-powered production sound promising. So yeah I’m excited but cautious. What about you?

I always blamed “lack of motivation,” but recently I had a small mindset shift that made everything feel easier and more manageable.

Instead of trying to “transform my lifestyle,” I started asking myself one simple question each morning:

**“What is one tiny thing I can do today that helps my future self?”**

That was it. No pressure, no all-or-nothing thinking.

Some days the tiny thing was drinking water first instead of coffee.  
Some days it was walking for 10 minutes after lunch.  
Other days it was choosing a high-fiber snack instead of something sugary.

These actions didn’t feel like big health changes, but they slowly built momentum. When I stopped expecting perfection, I actually stayed more consistent.

Another thing that helped was removing guilt from the process. If I had a “bad day,” I didn’t restart from zero. I just focused on doing one tiny helpful thing the next day. This one change kept me from giving up constantly.

I also started celebrating micro-wins: drinking enough water, sleeping earlier, eating something balanced, or even saying no to cravings once. These small decisions add up way more than we think.

Funny enough, once I focused on “just one helpful action,” I naturally ended up doing more without forcing myself.

I feel the need to write. I feel the need to share it with you. 

I've been hanging around on this sub for some time because I'm very into drinking myself. So much so that I made a lot of bad choices in life and ruined my last relationship. A relationship which, moreover, made me suffer and I still suffer today from this separation. 
But that's not the point. 

Why was I drinking? Just have that little extra something. For years I've been the funny guy at work or with my friends. When I had a little sluggishness and less desire to laugh, I was blamed for it. 
But every time I had THIS little drink, yes you know, the one that makes you forget all your worries and makes you believe that you are the king of the world, I was told “ah well there you are again, it’s the xxxx we love”. 

But the fall is hard. So we drink again to get back on track, until one morning, it becomes natural to have a glass of wine rather than coffee. Well yes, let's start the day in a good mood. 

But all YOUR testimonies have helped me realize that I need to stop. So I threw away all the alcohol I had and have been sober for 27 days now. It's not easy every day, but I struggle with this sentence that goes around in a loop 
Today I Won't Drink. 

Flat, and the need to share with you this evening?
I received bad news. Who hurts me, touches me and makes me see life in black. My first instinct was to say “I’m thirsty”. Yes, remember, that little drink that makes your life less sad. 
But no, I want and need to resist. Not this time, I must not break down. 

So I hope that these few words on this Sub will be enough to get rid of the excess emotion. I wish you all a good sober evening.",3,1763920457.0,stopdrinking,4,0.8,False

[The Purple Velvet Box the Tarot Deck & its Book come in, absolutely oozing lavish Luxury & Beauty](https://preview.redd.it/2x36r49p0y2g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb47ffa2d4554b6c565b70bc65cce9a0a4f32c46)

Diving into Dali's Tarot is Diving both into Dali's unConscious Mind, but also the entirety of the History of Western Artistic XPression as filtered thru this Mad Genius's Mind.  As a Master Painter, he is easily able to reCreate parts & snippets of various pieces of Western Art History and Paint In whatever he wishes to Represent on the Card at hand, XActly like Modern-Day Cut-Ups!  This is the Real Artistic Value of his Tarot Deck.  As the Final Deck to HighLight, I couldn't be Happier nor Prouder to deliver this whirlwind tour, and I'm gonna slow it down so we can savor the sumptuousness that the Dali Deck Represents.  So sit back and relax as we go on this Visual Art Tour featuring a dozen of Dali's Cards/Paintings as we Dive In together!

Although this was my very first Tarot (of my og 7) I selected for my first wave of Tarot Decks, it has continued to baffle me, despite going thru it's beautifully luxurious Purple & Gold Book twice now, shown above.  Note, this is by far the Largest Box & Book of any/all my 28 Tarot Decks, as large as the oversized boxes for both the StarMan Tarot & Gilded Tarot Royale' w/ cheese, combined.  Having said that, the Book is printed in 3 Languages w/ 78 of the Pages being Full-Colour Plates of the Cards.  It really feels like a Luxurious Art Book, worthy of any Coffee-Table.  Whilst I know I've shared a metric shit-ton of Dali's Artwork via the countless TAROT x7 Mandalas pix I've posted over the past nearly 2 years, I've never really honed in, focused, & given this AMAZING & UNIQUE Deck a proper Representation/HighLight here, and I'm glad I can rectify that w/ this post.

PLZ Note that only the GIANT RWS has larger Cards than this Deck.  Dali's Deck is just slightly larger than the Urban Tarot, the Largest of the ""regular"" Tarot Decks, and the Cards have a great Feel to them, as a Kinesthetic.

Dali has always been 1 of my absolute Favourite Painters, up there w/ M.C. Escher, even above most of my faves like Keith Haring, Jackson Pollack, and even above Picasso AFAIC  I heard he Created Tarot when I was last into it in the 1900s, but it was never published... until I had abandoned Tarot for the last couple decades.  In many ways, the publishing of the Salvador Dali Tarot was the SynChronicity I Desired to Show me that YES, Tarot is worth diving back into, even face-first.

There are a number of Reasons I really enjoyed this (LW)Book, not the least of which was being able to peer inside this Mad Genius's Mind - e.g., XPlaining that his frequent use of ""Dali Crutches"" Symbolically rePresents a Uniting of the Conscious & unConscious Minds, the Inner & Outer Worlds, Creating a Window Connecting the 2.  He also uses Butterflies to Represent the Psyche.  Early on it states:

""Dali is often equated w/ Surrealism itself, but in Reality he was more on the sidelines of the movement.  He invented his own Method, which he termed 'Paranoid-Critical', by Systemizing Chaos & Confusion one may outdo Reality.  The Paranoid-Critical method is based on a 'Critical and Systemic Objectification of Delusionary Association and Interpretation.'  It is Dali's 'Spontaneous method of irRational Knowledge.'""

Like all Surrealists, Dali was profoundly interested in Freud's Theories, quoting Dr. Freud when writing to Breton after meeting the good Dr. when Dali was 34 & Freud 82:

""If you look at the Paintings of the Old Masters, you are immediately InSpired to look for the unConscious aspects, but if you look at a Surrealist Picture, you are immediately InSpired to look for the Conscious part.""

Dali was initially inspired by his wife, Gala, to begin the process of Creating the 78 Paintings.  I think it a testament to Dali's understanding of the Cards' Symbolism that, even when the money ran out, Dali still saw this project thru to Completion, and not simply ""Finishing"" it.  I'm sure that, like myself - and yourself if you're into Tarot (those who become Hooked/Tzaddi'd into it) - it become somewhat of an Obsession.

Dail frequently gives different Correspondences to Cards, as you can see below, he will give different Attributions to Cards, e.g., Capricorn & Yod for 10 Wheel of Fortune.  Please Note this is one of the half dozen decks to return the 8 to Justice & 11 to Strength, from the RWS's ""Correction"" of such.  Perhaps connected (or due to dearth of Tarot Knowledge in the 1900s?), he has frequent differing AstroLogical Correspondences for the Trumps.  In my first Reading of his Book from 2023, I felt like he had ""Profound Gnowledge"" of the Cards, to the point that on a few Cards he gives ""different"" Text for the Card, but IIRC it show'd a ""Higher rEvolution"" of the Base Card's NRGs, if that makes any sense.  This is frequently evident in the Book's InSightFul text.  Whilst this is absolutely another Tarot Deck that is worth the purchase price for the Wisdom found in its Book alone - even @ $65! - if you're not going to get this Dali Deck for the less than $1/Dali Painting, I don't know that this sway you, but it should!

We shall see if I still feel this way as I go thru this Book to Complete this ""DownLoading"" Phase of Tarot, starting w/ the 1 Mage Card.  What Card could more Represent Dali than the 1 The Magician?  Below, you'll see him do something so NoteAble that it InSpired me to get an entire Tarot Deck off of it: Framing.  Whilst the SuperNova Deck uses more reFraming than a Picture Framing Shop, Dali only does it on tHIS Card, the Card of The Artist, the 1 Magician, breaking up and out of Frame on top.  Thankfully, the Artistic Representations that Dali Paints into the Cards' Paintings are all listed under each Card, e.g., using the Arches of Sainte-Chapelle, Paris on top.  Note the Aleph & Sol Correspond to 1 Magician for Dali, along w/ all the other many Differences in AstroLogical Correspondences:



[From my TAROT x7 Mandalas Collection w\/ the Dali Tarot in the Centerpiece where he belongs, surrounded by the Urban Tarot on Top, going deosil we have the Gilded Tarot Royale' w\/ cheese, Golden Dawn, Hermetic, Thoth oc, and Elemental Wisdom Tarot](https://preview.redd.it/gke9ophk3y2g1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a2ff379349ffe134c425ef847fcc8d012bc9906)

It should be mentioned that in the Text for each Card is a ""Title"", the Text itself, Practical Advice, & Pictorial Sources (including where the Art is located, in which Museums, &c.).  These Correspondences are also, alone, worth the Price of the Deck AFAIC  Whilst I won't go on about the GORGEOUS Female Cards since I can't show most of them (seriously, #FuckCensorship!), here's a few interesting Correspondences:

In the Jungian Tarot, the Animus & Anima were given to 1 Mage & 2 High Priestess.  Whilst Dali agrees w/ the latter, he assigns the Animus to 4 Emperor, which is given to ""Archetypal Father"" in the Jungian Deck.  I do need to recall how Dali was born just as Psychology began as an actual Science w/ Dr. Freud, and much of this is likely due to nonFamiliarity of Jungian Archetypes.  Or maybe he understands it better than I and simply disAgrees, which is far more likely TBH lol

Here's another alt-Correspondences, giving Heh & Mercury to 5 High Priest, using *Saint Anthony the Abbot and Donors*.  Note Dali goes against the Tradition of the ""Roots of Tradition"" that this 5 Hierophant Card usually rePresents, as Dali stresses the Importance of Inner Guidance that is alWays avaliable 24/7:



https://preview.redd.it/r2ksy8264y2g1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f34c11c1a12ad7987d8c8867c07c41d45d6587b

I wish reddit wouldn't auto-bounce this post (#FuckCensorship) if I included the 6 Lovers card that uses a Blue Morpho Butterfly.  When I was in the Amazon in the 1900s, it's mostly a Sea of Green.  However, a few times a day our group would be Graced w/ the Presence of a Blue Morpho, and it was always a Magical Moment as this HUGE IRIDESCENT BLUE ButterFly bigger than my hands would flit about before being swallowed up again in the Green Jungle.  I think both my Dad & I got at least one to land on each of us before our trip was done.

This is actually one of the more Deeply InSightFul Cards for Dali that I was talking about at the top, w/ great advice re: finding Love using *Neptune and Amphritite*.  So instead I'll show you the 7 Chariot again, using original Artwork for this Card:

Note it uses both Zain & Sagittarius for 7 Chariot, and whilst I'm still sorta new-ish to the Hebrew Letters, I actually think that the 7 Chariot might be a better fit for Sadges, NGL  Speaking of ""My Cards"", here's his 9 Hermit, Titled ""Healing"".  Basically, this Card Represents ""using your own Light to Heal and Sanctify your World and to turn the Earth back into its Virginal state"", despite not being Attributed to Virgo as is the usual.  Here's the info re: Pictorial Sources for this Card:

""*Portrait of Luca Pacioli*, born ca. 1445, was one of the most outstanding personalities of the Renaissance.  In 1494 he wrote his epochal work *Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita*, a summary of the entire mathematical knowledge of the time.  One of the Chapters made him especially famous, because it was the first comprehensive treatise on double-entry accounting.  In Milan, he taught Leonardo da Vinci perspective and proportionality.  This resulted in two of Leonardo's immortal works: the illustrations in Pacioli's book *De Divina Proportione* and the mural *The Last Supper* at the Dominican monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan"".

Here's Dali's take on 16 The Tower, which is Titled ""Encounter w/ the Absolute"", stating it Symbolizes both Babylon & Pentacost, they are 2 Poles.  Babylon became Man's Hubris and unAble to understand the many Tongues, whereas in Pentacost the Holy Ghost descends down and Flows Thru the Disciples in a Storm of Tongues of Fire, which Symbolizes the tearing down of Linguistic Barriers/Walls via Love.  This 16 Tower Card uses Symbolism from *The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian*:

...which brings us to 0 The Fool, put after 21 The World in Dali's Deck, it's also Titled ""The Zer0 as Role-Model"" (Roll-Model?).  In the Dive into 0 The Fool, it's mentioned that ""Pan"" means ""All"", i.e., ""Panic"" means ""all at once"", which is something my Linguistic side really enjoys.  The Card uses *Equestrian Monument to Bernarbo Visconti* (of the ""Visconti-Sforza"" fame?) for the Bottom of the Card.  Note also how it gives this card to Scorpio & Shin, the latter of which I rather like TBH:

Here's Dali's take on the 10Fire/Wands, often Titled ""Oppression"" w/ some poor sot who must Carry an overBurdening 10 Staffs.  Dali Titles it ""A Fulfilled Life"".  Here, I first noticed the overBearing Face in the Upper Left, which Dali confirms is supposed to Represent our own Conscience &/or SuperEgo.  In addition to the 10 Staffs, we see the Central figure carrying a Cross, as this is actually no less than Jesus the Christ from *The Carrying of the Cross*:

As I'm going thru the Book currently, I'm noticing that Dali has Unique Angles on more of the Cards than I recall, as evidenced next by the FoW/Fire of Water, Titled ""Living Faith"" and really meaning ""Belief"" or ""Passion"".  He uses *Napoleon Crosses the Alps* as the Knight of Wands, whose Heart/Cups is Enveloped, FulFilled, &/or Captured by a Woman he Loves.  Part of why Dali selected this dePiction of Napoleon is he is enVeloped/surrounded by his cloaks:

Here's a great Sample of ample Xamples of Dali using his own Art to Create Illusions in the 1Water w/ the below 2 Wings for the Grail - or are they 2 Faces coming 2gether?  He uses parts of *Allegory of the Grail*:

In the 6Air Dali has Titled this Card ""Transposition"" using a scene from Dante and Virgil in Hell.  As I re-Read these Text for each of Dali's Cards, there are subtle nuances that are hard to deScribe w/o completely Copy Paste'ing entire lengthy paragraphs, so I'm not going to try to do so beyond what I have already displayed above, herein this ""HighLight"" of this AMAZING Tarot Deck.  I.e., you're going to have to just purchase the Deck if you want more, and here's that Card:

Here in the 10Air, Titled ""The Fruit of the Mind"" (see what I'm saying?), we see both the ""Good"" and the ""Bad"" Fruits of the Mind.  The old Quote ""If you see Buddha on the Road, Kill Buddha"" comes up re: this 10 of Swords, along w/ *The Death of Julius Caesar*:

The FingerPrints only further elucidate upon the Sensual aspect, along w/ the Hands-On nature of Being King of Your Own World.

He does not like watches so that’s completely out of topic. He likes shoes but I don’t think I can get anything in that price range, I also don’t know his shoe size. I don’t know his clothing sizes either to be fair but they can be exchanged so I’m cool with that. He wears belts. He likes scented items.

It's where I was born, where I grew up, and is probably where I will die. To some people this sounds like a miserable existence, but honestly, I don't think I’d have it any other way.

My Town had an industrial boom once, but that time came and went long before I was ever born. Only the old-timers remember that era now, and even then, most of them were only around for the tail end of it. The rest of us only know this Town for what it has since become: a ghost of its former self, marred by the rusting titan of a bygone age that now looms over our home like a dead sentinel, its hollow body a symbol of what once was, and what will never be again. Our Town rests in that immense shadow now, aching and pleading to once again feel the sunlight that will forever be obscured by its past. 

But hey, it’s home.

My lifelong dedication to this Town is what made me want to become a firefighter. I wanted to give back to the community that shaped me, and the best way I could think to do this was to join the local fire department. That was going on twenty years ago now, and in that time I’ve seen and experienced things, both on and off the job, that most people would struggle to believe. But I guess that comes with the territory of living in a cursed town.

Everybody who lives here learns at a young age that something isn’t right about this place. One day you become old enough to realize that other towns you visit aren’t quite like the one you call home; they don’t carry that familiar layer of darkness that seems to envelop you like a blanket every time you cross back over our Town’s borders after spending time away. Other towns don’t feel like they’re perpetually cold and cloudy, even on hot summer days. They don’t come with that overwhelming sense that they should have passed into the realm of forgotten history generations ago, but are kept alive by a stubborn populace that refuses to move away and leave them in the past. Most “outsiders” who visit The Town can often feel this shift right away, and usually with greater intensity, since they’re not properly acclimated by years spent beneath The Town’s oppressive weight. It’s for this reason that visitors typically try to stay in The Town for as little time as possible, and why any moving trucks that come here tend to arrive empty.

Some people say The Town has been like this since the beginning of time, destined to inherit its curse since before it was even brought into existence all those many years ago. Others say it acquired the curse through some horrible event, and that it was once just like any other forgettable American small town. I don’t know which theory I subscribe to; on one hand, I can’t see why this land would be so infested with evil for no discernable reason, but on the other, it’s difficult to see The Town as anything other than the source of malice and misery that I’ve always known it to be. The least popular belief of the bunch is that The Town isn’t cursed at all, and that all of the misfortunes herein are merely the spawn of cruel coincidence. There are fewer and fewer followers of this model every year, and soon it will likely go completely extinct.

When searching for the specific occurrence that kicked off The Town’s long string of woes, many of those who believe in Theory B point to an incident that occurred at the turn of the twentieth century; those who follow Theory A merely see this event as a symptom of the much older rot that infests this place. Either way, both agree that the event in question is directly connected to the darkness that lives here.

It happened in the old coal mine, which at the time was one of the major pillars of The Town’s economy. A terrible fire broke out in the mine, the source of which is still debated to this day. The inferno turned the wooden supports above the miners’ heads to ash and caused several collapses inside of the main shaft. Eleven miners were trapped inside for four long days while the townsfolk worked tirelessly to dig through the rubble in order to rescue them. By the time they had reached the miners, all eleven of them were dead. Five of them had suffocated, slain by the toxic air and rancid smoke created by the raging blaze, while three of them were crushed in the shaft collapse. The bodies of the remaining three, however, were never found. It is still speculated as to what became of them, and everybody who you ask has their own theory. I’ll allow you to come up with your own.

The collapse that had doomed those miners also did the same thing to the fire, smothering the blaze so that by the time the townsfolk made it into the collapsed shaft, all that remained of the terrible inferno was a few dying embers. Despite little damage actually being done to the mine itself, it never managed to recover from this disastrous event. Any attempts to reopen it were met with further tragedy. More inexplicable fires broke out, and any new shafts excavated quickly collapsed, often entombing fresh victims in a coffin of furious earth. More strange were the miners who continued to vanish without a trace,  much like the three who had disappeared during that initial devastation. There were reports of men disappearing mid-conversation with their constituents, who turned away for a mere moment to take a sip of water or wipe sweat from their brows, only to turn back and see that their companions were gone, seemingly plucked out of space or dragged into the nearby darkness without so much as a sound. Eventually all of the miners, understandably scared for their lives, wound up moving on to new work, and The Town could not find anybody willing to replace them. After years of attempts to rehabilitate the mine, it was finally shut down for good, thus rendering one of The Town’s main economic stimulants officially deceased.

But though the mine is abandoned and in disuse, that does not mean it remains inactive.

Random fires spring up in that mine at least once a year, despite it remaining empty and free of any activity that would potentially cause such ignitions. In the interest of preventing our town from becoming another Centralia, our department, as well as all those in the surrounding area, work together to extinguish these blazes as they come up. The Town has an entire taskforce in place that monitors the mine for fire activity, and when any is spotted, they immediately dispatch us to the scene. Sometimes we manage to put out the blaze in a few minutes; other times we spend hours battling the fresh inferno that seems intent on taking the entire Town with it into the deepest pits of ruin.

At this point, I feel like I have some kind of sixth sense that allows me to anticipate the mine calls a couple of days in advance. I get a tightness in my stomach that continues to twist like an old wind up toy until it finally snaps. Despite seeing it coming, it ruins my day all the same when that call comes in over dispatch.  I hate returning to that horrible place. The invisible miasma of suffering that I feel in there is sometimes strong enough to make me nauseous within a matter of minutes, and I always get the strange sense that there is something watching me from somewhere deeper in the cavern. Every time we’re there, I fully expect to turn away from one of my companions for a mere moment only to turn back and find that they have disappeared, the charged hoseline they were handling now dancing crazily on the dirty ground as it violently discharges water without guidance or reason. This hasn’t ever happened, but that doesn’t mean that it never will. It could even end up being *me* that gets spirited away into the wanting gloom, dragged by some unseen force that doesn’t even award me the luxury of a final scream. I suppose only time will tell.

Practitioners of Theory B who present the mine disaster as the source of the Town’s curse purport that something old and evil was dug up from the earth on that fateful day well over a century ago, and while I am not entirely sold on such a tale, I admit that it’s hard to argue against it considering all that I’ve experienced down there. That mine is a dark, hellish place, and I shudder to think that anywhere in this world could embody so much natural animosity. It’s strangely more comforting to think that some event kickstarted the decades of concentrated malice that radiate from it, instead of believing that such putrid energy has been there from the start. Maybe an evil contained within the oldest stones of this planet since time immemorial isn’t much better than that same presence being free from the start, but clearly there is enough of a distinction there that it’s created a schism between the townsfolk, so I suppose it does make some kind of difference in the minds of the people.

But the mine isn’t the only place of great and concentrated misfortune in this Town, and thus is not the only potential source for the curse that Option B folk point to. I’d be remiss not to also talk about the old steel mill, which, while now long empty, used to work in tandem with the mine in order to fuel this Town’s former prosperity, much like how the mine fueled the mill’s once-hot furnaces. It saddens me to think that those same furnaces will never know such heat again.

The mill, once a thriving colossus of its day, suffered greatly following the mine incident. Without a constant flow of coal coming in from the mine, the mill’s productivity began to slow. Coal, much like the ore that was refined within the mill, began coming in from other mines in the area. This kept the mill afloat for a few more good decades, but it also made operating the mill more expensive, and as money and resources dried up, so too did the prosperity that this great mastodon of its age had once enjoyed. The mill managed to chug along at a decent pace until the mid-1950s, when its viability finally ran out. By then, the Town had long-since given up its dream of returning to the height of its industrial glory, but nobody wanted to tell that to the old mill. They allowed the poor thing to continue believing it made a difference right up until the very end.

Further tragedy struck on the mill’s final day of operation. A disgruntled millworker, devastated and desperate from the news of the mill’s closure, forced his way into the foreman’s office and gunned the man down without so much as a word. The millworker slew four more of his peers before he was finally subdued. He would never see the inside of a jail cell for his barbaric act; his fellow millworkers, riled into a cocktail of rage, took turns attacking the unarmed and defeated man. They beat him so badly that he perished right there on the office floor. It’s unknown if his killers were ever prosecuted for what they did.

This final act in the mill’s long tenure seems to have marked it as a place of darkness that rivals that of the mine. In the years that followed its closure, rumors persisted that the empty old structure became a place of devil worship and depraved acts of unspeakable sin. Whether or not these events ever did or still do take place is unclear, but this doesn’t stop us from getting called out to the mill several times a year. Usually we’re there to investigate a recurring and mysterious burning smell, only for us to arrive and find that the mill’s old furnaces are as cold as ever. First responders that have been called to the mill over the years have reported that they’ve seen dark figures of shadow and subtly shifting silhouettes deep within the bowels of the old building. I’ve personally heard strange, mechanical noises echoing through the mill’s ghostly, abandoned passageways, and have sworn to everybody I’ve told this to that I once heard the rattling report of a gunshot coming from the direction of what was once the foreman’s office.

There are those who believe that the victims of that tragic day, including the murderer himself, continue to work an endless shift in their old place of employment, even though operations there came to an end many decades ago. Some townsfolk leave them containers of food and thermoses of coffee at the mill’s entrance, only to return the next day to find these vessels emptied of their contents. While I can’t confidently say that I know who is enjoying these free meals, I highly doubt there is a person in Town who would dare to steal food from those old millworkers.

The misfortunes of The Town are not isolated to these two sepulchers of the past. While the mine and the mill only see occasional activity, there are other goings on in this Town that affect the townsfolk much more frequently, and, in turn, affect my department more frequently as well.

Everybody who lives in The Town, without exception, gets into at least one automobile accident per year. Most of these are small fender benders, which is the kind of accident that everybody prays for. Some of them are significantly worse. The worse ones are the ones that *we* have to respond to, and they often aren’t pretty.

The plus side to this is that everybody in Town is incredibly friendly and understanding at the scene of a collision. Two guys back into each other while pulling out of their parking spaces at the grocery store? They laugh it off and may even buy each other a beer that night as a way of saying thanks for being their accident that year. An old woman side swipes a young man’s car and takes out his driver’s side mirror? Well, hey, at least his arm wasn’t sticking out of the window at the time. Everybody’s cars are perpetually dinged up and insurance rates in our Town are through the roof, but people are just happy when their accident turns out to be relatively minor. Of course, there are those few unfortunates who wind up in *two* accidents in a year, which really is a testament to their bad luck more than it is to the town’s curse. There’s always that nagging feeling in the back of your mind after you’ve been in what you believe to be your accident: was this *actually* my accident for the year, or am I going to be severely disappointed in a few months? Some people arrive at an unfortunate answer to this question down the line.

A rather large river runs through the heart of Town. Once a key waterway for shipping ore and metals in and out of Town, it has become much more of a liability in the decades since that industry’s demise. Any and all rain can and often does lead to severe and sudden flooding, resulting in many residents being trapped if they’re anywhere near the river when some unexpected bad weather hits. It is for this reason that our fire department requires that members have several different water rescue certifications under their belt, because they’re definitely going to need them. We pull dozens of people out of the water every year. Many of them are still alive when we do it.

An old, neglected railroad track stretches along the outskirts of Town, extending for untold miles in two directions as it passes through the seemingly endless expanse of dense, dark forest that surrounds our Town on all sides. The track hasn’t been in use for going on thirty years now — not since they created the new line that passes through all the bigger and more important communities to the north — but that doesn’t stop creatures from showing up in dead, gore-strewn heaps on or near the tracks on a semi-regular basis. Deer are usually mostly intact, but smaller animals like foxes and raccoons are lucky if we’re able to tell what species they are based on the carcass they leave behind. Nobody can properly explain how these animals suffer such violent deaths in such close proximity to the abandoned tracks, but the popular legend is that there’s a phantom train still running back and forth along the line at night, never able to reach its destination but also not able to return to where it began. Sometimes it even comes to a stop, and if you climb aboard, you’re whisked away to the land of the departed, never to be seen by any of us again until the day we step beyond the threshold of death. I suppose this is preferable to the alternative encounter you could have with such a train; I’ve seen what that thing can do, and it’s not a pretty sight — especially not when the victim has a familiar face.

Disease seems to spread exceptionally easily here. A simple strain of the common cold can knock half of the community out of commission for several weeks, and has the power to halt life in Town for long stretches of time in the colder months. Drive through Town on a random week in February, and you’d think we had abandoned the place like we already should have done a long time ago. There have been a number of times where the fire department has been stripped to a mere fraction of its normal workforce thanks to a particularly stubborn infestation of flu that decides  to linger in our station for upwards of a month. In these situations, we pretty much all end up catching it — the most debilitated by the disease get to take some time off to recover, but those of us whose immune systems put in overtime are rewarded by getting to work some overtime of our own, all while trying to convince ourselves that we’re not about to keel over at any minute from the agony of the disease that we’re just barely able to fight off. The mine hasn’t been quite cruel enough to set itself ablaze during one of these bouts of illness, at least not while I’ve been working at the department, and I pray that it never develops enough of a malevolent streak to test such a thing out. I’m not exaggerating when I say that such an occurrence could easily spell the end for our little Town.

Death is a large part of life here. Without looking up any statistics, I’m willing to bet that we bury at least twice as many dead each year as any of the nearby towns, all of which are double our size. Demise comes in many forms here; there are a surprisingly high number of ways that a life can be lost in a Town this relatively small. There are the “expected” deaths — the kind of things that the Town macabrely anticipates each year, like drownings during river floods or folks perishing in an especially bad yearly car accident — but there are plenty of strange and mysterious deaths that nobody is able to wrap their head around. Being a firefighter, I’ve witnessed the aftermath of a good number of these strange deaths myself, and have spent more nights than I can count falling asleep while trying to solve their unsolvable mysteries in my troubled mind. Folks have returned home to find their healthy loved ones sitting at the kitchen table, midway through a meal that they will never finish, their deaths seeming to have come simply because the Reaper was having a slow day. Grocery store workers have gone missing for the better part of a week, only to be found wide-eyed and blue, trapped in a freezer that had been used countless times in the days since their absence, and from which food had been placed on shelves and then subsequently purchased by customers. Tiny, loving lapdogs that don’t even seem physically capable of harming another living creature have suddenly snapped for just long enough to bury their little teeth into their owners’ necks, hitting just the right spot to make their victims bleed out within a matter of minutes.

Death comes for everybody here, young and old and sick and healthy alike. Most of the time it strikes at random, but it does follow a few recognizable patterns that everybody in Town recognizes and accepts. Without going into detail, I’ll say this: There is a reason that people in this Town try not to grow too attached to their firstborn children.

I could go on. I could tell you every single detail of every single strange occurrence in this Town, but if I haven’t managed to convince you that it’s cursed by now, then I doubt that I’m going to. I was never really trying to convince anybody of anything by sharing these stories in the first place. My goal was just to highlight a place largely forgotten by time, but still very much deserving of recognition, both for all that it has endured over the generations, as well as for all that it has accomplished. And though these accomplishments might remain cold and buried beneath a dark and heavy past, the pride that they inspire is still very much present in all who live here. There is a reason that so many of us who live in this Town are lifers, and it’s not just because the economic downturn in this region has made it difficult for people to escape it. There are plenty of folks here who wouldn’t leave the Town, curse and all, if given the chance, and I count myself among them. That very well could be the curse itself talking; it’s possible that it’s so deeply rooted within our minds and souls and culture that it tricks us into thinking that we actually enjoy living in this miserable, little corner of America, but if this is the case, then I have no intention of fighting it.

My Town is certainly not an easy place to live in. Something lurks here; something festers. And it likes to remind us all that it’s here with us. But like I said earlier, this Town is still home.

For the last couple of days I’ve been getting that familiar twisting in my gut again: the one that warns me of a coming fire down in the old mine. We haven’t had one yet this year, so we’re definitely overdue. If people are interested, maybe after the fire I can share more stories about my Town (assuming the thing that is in the mine doesn’t actually take me this time). But in the meantime, I’ll leave you with something that’s been on my mind lately, and what actually encouraged me to share these stories in the first place.

I had the upsetting realization recently that some day, maybe some day relatively soon, my Town is going to be gone. It’s going to be forgotten. Some day it will be abandoned, either because the economy took too great of a tumble, or the mine fire finally became too great for us to combat, or simply because that one last stubborn holdout of a resident finally decided that putting up with this dying place just wasn’t worth the effort anymore. Regardless of how it goes down, I know the simple truth is that we likely won’t be here forever.

So I just ask that you do your best to remember the places and the people that the world has forgotten about. Do your best to keep their memory alive in some way.

I'm more of a tea than a coffee person, so most of my questions are coming from a week long rabbit hole on the internet about how espresso machines work. I'm probably going to get her a bambino since it seems to be a pretty solid entry level machine. However, for various reasons (mainly it's expensive), we're probably not going to get a grinder.

I'm aware that the grinder is important (possibly more so than the machine from what I've read), but the council (my siblings) have decided they'd rather get a machine first.

She has a hand grinder at home (but doesn't use it since she usually makes coffee early in the morning), but she's signed up to a coffee subscription at a nice independent coffee shop from near by.

So I have two questions- is it better to keep asking them to grind at the setting they're doing now (for a moka pot/stovetop coffee), or get them to switch to their espresso grind size (I know that this won't be dialled in to the machine but looking for a lesser of two evils)?

And depending on which grind it is, should I still tell her to use the pressurised baskets on the machine, or can she get away with using a regular basket with espresso ground coffee?

Mornings, when you wake up hungover and you work at the Post Office — in delivery — arePost Office II the worst.
Murderous.

Even the thought of all the people I’m supposed to face that day sits in my stomach like a stone.
The pissed-off bus driver — he’ll either be late or arrive early, almost like he does it on purpose just to ruin your day.
The administrator — always irritated, always angry about something:
badly filled delivery forms,
not enough successful deliveries,
or God forbid you come late, and it’s a Friday.

Then you get a life lesson like never before.

And me?
I’m her favorite target in that whole department.

I think about breakfast for a second and immediately give up on the idea.
Clothes — wrinkled, but good enough.
Grab the backpack. Quick check — yesterday’s items are still there.
Open the second pocket, throw in a banana, sneaker on foot, and half-running to the bus stop.

I arrive. Look at the time — 7:40.
Perfect, enough time for a vending-machine coffee.

Battle with the coins, but I win at the end. This time, no sugar.
Double espresso. I take the cup and, as if everything in my life is finally in order, I wait for the bus.
Unless the driver decides to ignore me — because he feels like ruining the day.

The bus arrives — chaos everywhere.
I down the espresso in one go, burn my tongue, swear under my breath, and squeeze myself inside.
The night Troy was attacked, I swear there was less crowding than in this damn bus taking me to work.
Grandmas, grandpas, students… cheap perfume, sweat, and bad breath.

And I had to survive it for four more stops.

With effort, like pushing through some dense Amazon jungle, I force my way toward the door.
I can’t take it anymore — jump down the steps and escape.

Saved.
The air isn’t exactly clean — this city isn’t famous for that — but still, I’m saved.

I’m scared to look at the time. If I’m late, who’s gonna listen to the administrator?
And hungover like this… I feel like she’ll scream even louder today.

I cut through the Old Bazaar, hoping to make it to the riverside bridge faster.
If I pick up the pace, maybe I won’t be too late.

No real options. I let gravity pull me forward.

And — of course — it starts drizzling.

Running while hungover is not a smart idea.
Out of breath, I stop in front of the old barracks — the same ones with the cracked white paint that’s been sucking the life out of me for the past two years.

Left of the gate, the Post Office logo.
Something like: “fast delivery, discipline, professionalism.”

In reality, we did none of that.
We were a loose, half-drunk squad that used every chance to prioritize beer over parcels.

Inside the yard — a few cars with the logo.
In the middle, the Citroën that’s been dead for three weeks, no one fixing it, the roof used by two older colleagues as a table for cigarettes, coffee, and phones.
I greet them, interrupt their football debate; they greet me back through the cigarette smoke and continue.

I step into the barrack.
Front and center sits Mike — security — the company’s knight.
He greets me like a friend, not like with the others.

I clock in on the old computer on his desk: 27 minutes late.
“Good,” I tell myself, “not 30.”

Before heading to the office, Mike says:
“Careful today, man… she’s in a special mood.”

Of course he means the administrator.

Down the hallway I go.
To be honest — when I don’t want to do something… alright, more honest: when I’m scared of something, I delay it as much as possible.
So I stop at the announcement board.
Not because anything interests me there — just to steal five seconds of breathing room.

I greet a couple of colleagues from the other department, but they’re in a hurry; no time for small talk.

I gather courage and walk into the office.
The administrator is already mid-argument with another colleague.
I find a free chair, sit down, and—naturally—nobody notices me.

I tune out of their argument.
My mind drifts:
How long with these deliveries, these administrators, these pissed-off recipients, the fines for being late, Monday meetings, miserable paychecks, and bonuses that exist only on paper?

She finally sends the colleague out — he storms off.
Triumphant, she sips the last of her morning coffee.
Then she finally notices me — no greeting — and says:

“How long with this lateness?”

I ignore the comment.
Open the backpack, pull out yesterday’s parcels with the return list.
“Here,” I say.

She snatches them immediately and starts listing my mistakes like she’s reading poetry.
She enjoys this — she’s the ruler, the one who decides how the day will go.

Rural delivery is her favorite punishment.
No street numbers, houses with no signs — the hardest route.

She looks at me victoriously:

“You’re rural delivery today. No car. By bus.”

The Inquisition, I think, was kinder to its victims.

I leave the office.
The rain is hammering the metal roof.
Mike looks at me with pity, immediately guessing the punishment.

“Have a nice day…” he says.

We both know it will be anything but nice.

I step outside and hide under the awning — the rain is coming down hard.
Check the time: 11:40.
Fifteen minutes to catch the rural bus.

(No umbrella. Of course.)

I pull up the hood and start running toward the bus stop…

After a long development (and a lot of coffee), I’m excited to finally announce the global launch of **Idle Pocket Crafter 2.**  

Some of you might remember the first *Idle Pocket Crafter* I released back in 2019. I learned a lot from that project, and with the sequel I wanted to keep the cozy mining/crafting loop while expanding the depth, polish, and long-term progression.  

**What is it?**  

An idle game about gathering resources, crafting gear, exploring zones, unlocking pets, progressing skill trees, and upgrading... a *lot*.    
It starts simple, but opens into a deeper RPG-style idle game with tons of long-term progression.  

**Key Features:**  

* Active & Idle: You can play actively to speed things up or set up automation for mining.    
* Crafting: Lots of crafting recipes, equipments with various rarities and mods and so on.  
* Prestige System: Prestige and delve into prestige upgrades  
* No Forced Ads: I hate them as much as you do. All ads are strictly optional for bonuses. The game is fully playable F2P.  

🍎 **iOS:** [https://apps.apple.com/app/id6748950645](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6748950645)  

🤖 **Android:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruotogames.pocketcrafter2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruotogames.pocketcrafter2)  

**Launch Bonus:** To celebrate the launch, use code **2122112** (Gives 2500 Amber, 15 Mana Gems, and 3 Exalted Artifact Chests). To enter the code, go to Mayor's House in the village.  

I’m a solo dev, so feedback is incredibly valuable to me. If you run into any bugs or have balance suggestions, please let me know here or on our Discord.

1p4sww1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingSkillSet/comments/1p4sww1/your_love_language_is_probably_wrong_how_to/,Your love language is probably wrong: how to actually find your REAL one,"Everywhere you scroll, someone’s telling you your love language from a 5-question quiz. Or worse, slapping a TikTok label on you like “acts of service girly” because you made someone’s coffee. It’s catchy. But it’s also lazy.  

Too many people are walking around convinced their love language is “gifts” just because their ex never bought them flowers. Or they claim “physical touch” because it sounds spicy. But the truth? Most of us misunderstand our own love languages. And it’s messing up our relationships.

Love languages aren’t just about how you *want* love. They’re also about how you *recognize* it. And more importantly, they’re shaped by your attachment style, family history, and even trauma. This post pulls together the best insights from books, therapists, and psychology researchers to help you cut through the BS and find the love language that’s actually yours.

Let’s break it down.

*Based on research from Dr. Gary Chapman’s original work*, newer studies from the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships*, and podcast interviews with top relationship experts like Esther Perel and Dr. Alexandra Solomon, here's how to rethink everything you know about love languages:

* **Start with the wound, not the want**  
   Most people pick a love language based on what feels good. But a better question is: *what hurts the most when it’s missing?*
   * Dr. Alexandra Solomon, therapist and professor at Northwestern, argues this is the real compass. If being ignored makes you spiral, your love language might be *quality time*, not *words*.
   * If you grew up fending for yourself emotionally, you might think you value “independence.” But what you *actually* crave is “acts of service” because no one ever helped you.
   * *Ask yourself*: What kind of love makes you feel resentful when you don’t get it? What’s the first thing you criticize in a partner?

* **Look at how you express love, not just receive it**  
   Our primary love language isn’t always aligned with how we *like* to receive love. It’s often how we’ve taught ourselves to *show* love.
   * According to Dr. Gary Chapman’s own later interviews, many people unconsciously express the love they never got.  
   * For example, if you go out of your way to clean, cook, and run errands for someone, you may assume you value *acts of service*. But sometimes it’s just a survival mechanism learned from a parent dynamic.
   * Check your habits. What do you *default* to when someone you love is struggling?

* **Test in conflict, not comfort**  
   Your “real” love language shows up when you fight.  
   * In a study from the *University of Warsaw* (2021), researchers found partner satisfaction increased when people received support in their specific conflict reassurance style, which often varies from their daily love language.
   * For instance, you might think your love language is *physical touch*, but in conflict, you need *affirmation* and soothing words to feel safe again.
   * Tip from couples therapist Julie Menanno: After your next argument, notice what makes you feel repaired the fastest. That’s your emotional language under pressure.

* **Check what you envy in others**  
   Envy is a powerful (and honest) diagnostic tool.  
   * What kind of love do you *notice* in other relationships that makes you feel “ugh” or “damn, I wish my partner did that”?
   * Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco, author of *Platonic*, says we often repress love that feels too “vulnerable” to need. Especially men who were taught not to ask for emotional attention.  
   * If you roll your eyes at couples who are super affectionate in public, ask yourself: Is that annoyance or hidden yearning?

* **Audit your relationship timeline**  
   Track your past 2–3 relationships and write down when you felt *most loved* and *most neglected*. Patterns beat preferences.
   * This is a concept pulled from *The Love Prescription* by Drs. John and Julie Gottman. They recommend looking at actual emotional impact points, not stated preferences.
   * For example: Maybe you *say* you hate clinginess, but that one partner who always called to check in made you feel the most secure.  
   * List specific moments like: “When they cooked for me after a stressful day” or “When they didn’t respond to my text for 12 hours.” Then categorize them according to the 5 love languages.

Bonus tip: There’s actually a *sixth* unofficial love language surfacing in research: **shared meaning**.  

* According to the Gottmans’ latest work, long-term satisfaction is tied to whether couples build a shared sense of ""why"", family rituals, traditions, values.
* This isn't just about *what* you do, but *why* you do it together. Some people don’t feel loved unless they feel like their lives are intertwined beyond just logistics.

If you’re still unsure, try stacking these 3 prompts:
* What makes me feel most insecure in relationships?  
* What do I complain about quietly (or out loud)?  
* What do I wish someone would *just know* to do, without me having to ask?

Your real love language lives in those spaces.

And by the way, it’s totally normal for it to evolve. Trauma, healing, maturing, they all shift our emotional blueprint. The version of yourself that craved validation at 22 might need peace and predictability at 30.

So yeah, that 7-minute quiz is cute. But if you want the *real* answer, you have to get a little messier. Look into your history, your reactions, your patterns. Because love isn’t just found. It’s decoded.

I greet a couple of colleagues from the other department, but they’re in a hurry; no time for small talk.

I gather courage and walk into the office.
The administrator is already mid-argument with another colleague.
I find a free chair, sit down, and—naturally—nobody notices me.

I tune out of their argument.
My mind drifts:
How long with these deliveries, these administrators, these pissed-off recipients, the fines for being late, Monday meetings, miserable paychecks, and bonuses that exist only on paper?

She finally sends the colleague out — he storms off.
Triumphant, she sips the last of her morning coffee.
Then she finally notices me — no greeting — and says:

“How long with this lateness?”

I ignore the comment.
Open the backpack, pull out yesterday’s parcels with the return list.
“Here,” I say.

She snatches them immediately and starts listing my mistakes like she’s reading poetry.
She enjoys this — she’s the ruler, the one who decides how the day will go.

Rural delivery is her favorite punishment.
No street numbers, houses with no signs — the hardest route.

She looks at me victoriously:

“You’re rural delivery today. No car. By bus.”

The Inquisition, I think, was kinder to its victims.

I leave the office.
The rain is hammering the metal roof.
Mike looks at me with pity, immediately guessing the punishment.

“Have a nice day…” he says.

We both know it will be anything but nice.

I step outside and hide under the awning — the rain is coming down hard.
Check the time: 11:40.
Fifteen minutes to catch the rural bus.

(No umbrella. Of course.)

I pull up the hood and start running toward the bus stop…

The difference is ridiculous.
I once fired off sixty personalized cold emails in an hour while watching Hulu and drinking coffee. No paid tools, no bots, no keyword spam. 
Just a system that works hard so I don’t have to.
If you want leads and you’re willing to do a little outreach, you shouldn’t be paying people to send the exact same tired message to the exact same pool of Reddit users. 
With a little patience and creativity anyone can build a better system at home, for free, with tools you already have. 
And it’ll get you actual replies instead of digital going to the digital void.

If you’re fine with doing outreach, you don’t need overpriced “AI lead gen.”
You need direction, a bit of structure, and a system tailored to your service.
And the truth is simple: It’s all way easier than the people selling it will ever tell you.
But honestly,
Even if you never build your own system, at least stop paying people to sabotage your chances before you even hit send. At that point, doing it manually is better.

Here is the 5 minute psychological trick I used before bed to eliminate all morning resistance.,"I struggled for years with discipline. I’d set a goal to wake up at 5AM or go to the gym, and my conscious mind was 100% on board. But when the alarm went off, a tidal wave of internal resistance would hit me, and I’d choose the easy path every time. This is the definition of **self sabotage**.

I realized the problem wasn't my willpower; it was my **subconscious brain** being totally unprepared for the sudden change.

**The 5-Minute Trick  Subconscious Pre-loading :**

Instead of relying on sheer willpower, I started spending 5 minutes right before I fell asleep on a specific goal-oriented mental exercise (a form of targeted self-suggestion). During this time, I would visualize my 5 AM wake-up not as a struggle, but as a moment of pure relief and momentum. I would 'feel' the cold air, 'hear' the coffee brewing, and 'experience' the satisfaction of completing the task before I was even asleep.

The change was instantaneous. When the alarm went off, the resistance was gone. It felt like my brain had already processed the decision while I was sleeping.

My theory is that by programming the desired outcome while the brain is in a receptive, drowsy state, you effectively **pre-load the willpower.**

Got some nice suggestions but by far the one thing that made me really fall in love was doing a bicycle tour of the city! 

We spent half the day biking along Kamo River, through a few gardens, ancient forests, near the philosophers path and around some residential neighborhoods. The entire itinerary was a local’s experience of Kyoto, and we got to see all the temples and shrines where locals like to go, away from big tourist crowds. We saw the parts of Kyoto that were serene and quaint and basically out of a studio ghibli movie. 

I also loved wandering the shops around a few blocks north of Nishiki Market. It’s filled with boutique stores with high end crafts, coffee shops, just artsy and zen vibes everywhere, and it had very little crowds at all. Some highlights were ShinPuhKan mall, Chocolate Bel Amer, and Sake Hall Masuya. Some of the stores felt like walking into an art gallery. 

So if you’re visiting Kyoto please rent a bike to explore (riding up and down Kamo River banks is the easiest self guided route), even better book a tour with a local guide who can show you the hidden gems in the city.

Most moms try to “fix” their mornings during the morning chaos…
But the truth?

A smooth morning starts the night before.

If your mornings feel rushed, chaotic, stressful, with kids running around, forgotten bags, cold coffee, and constant hurry…

The problem isn’t your morning.
It’s the lack of preparation the night before.

Here’s how to build a morning routine that actually works — without adding pressure or more tasks to your busy day:

1) Prepare just 3 things the night before

You don’t need to prepare EVERYTHING.
Just three essentials:

Clothes for you + the kids

Lunchboxes

School bags / keys / laptop

These three alone reduce 50% of morning chaos.

2) Write a 2-minute “Mini Plan” for the next day

Before bed, write down only:

Your top personal task

Your top work task

One self-care action that will make you feel good

This is the “Rule of 3” — it helps your brain wake up organized instead of stressed.

3) Remove decisions from the morning

Morning brain = tired + low energy + overwhelmed.
So remove decisions.

Decide the night before:

What you’ll wear

What you’ll serve for breakfast

Your first task of the day

The fewer decisions you make in the morning, the calmer your day starts.

4) Reset your space

This is not cleaning — just a quick reset:

Kitchen counters clear

Table wiped

Coffee station ready

Living room tidy

This gives your brain a feeling of control first thing in the morning.

5) Prepare your time

If you have an early meeting → set two alarms.
If you’re going out with your kids → prepare shoes by the door.
If you want to work out → place your leggings near your bed.

Every minute you prepare at night = 5 minutes saved in the morning.

6) Do a “Shutdown Routine”

A simple signal to your brain that the day is over.

For example:

Close your laptop

Write 3 thoughts in a notebook

Drink water

Prepare your bed

This helps you sleep better and wake up calmer.
 The Bottom Line

1p4slj8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4slj8,On time rate update Miami Market!,"I dash in Miami on a regular bike (no e-bike, all legs) and used to make $200–$300 a day on Earn by Time while easily staying 90–95% On-Time. I’m one of the top dashers in the city by every metric. Since the new rollout, my On-Time has tanked 10–15% and I’m barely holding 70%.

Miami deliveries are almost all luxury high-rises: building security, slow elevators, waiting on drawbridges, no cell service inside concrete buildings. Just getting past security and an elevator eats 5-10minutes minimum.

The new Earn by Time system is straight-up broken here almost feels rigged👀. Two orders I had within a couple hours of each other prove it:

•  Earn by Time stacked order → 1 minute from leaving the restaurant to the second customer’s drop-off time. (60 seconds to get to a high-rise, check in with security, wait for the elevator, and deliver… impossible.)

•  Earn by Offer order (different restaurant, same general time/area) → almost an hour given for a trip under a mile. I delivered it 25+ minutes early.

Same city, same traffic, same high-rise obstacles, but DoorDash only hammers you with unrealistic timers when you’re on Earn by Time. It shows they don’t actually care about real-world wait times — they just weaponize the clock against Earn by Time dashers to keep their cost low by discouraging drivers to use this in fear of being late 

There’s zero city-by-city buffer adjustment. In a market like Miami with bridges, security, and high-rises everywhere, the system can’t work fairly, yet they rolled it out anyway.

I’ve had to ditch Earn by Time completely this week and switch to Earn by Offer just to save my account.

Anyone else in Miami or similar markets getting wrecked by these zero-grace-period Earn by Time stacks since the update?",1,1763919134.0,DoorDashDrivers,3,1.0,False

1p4shbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p4shbz/blood_in_the_water_pt2_nectar_of_eternity/,Blood in the Water Pt.2 Nectar of eternity,"Everyone was pushed away from the beach and subsequently ousted from the campgrounds, the entire park being shut down for the foreseeable future. Since the phones and radios weren't working, Dave and Hector helped me load Michael into the back of my van. I drove like hell. The nearest hospital was a clinic twenty minutes away from the campgrounds in the town of Alexandria Springs. They were equipped with enough to handle breaks, bruises, burns, and your general camping injuries. Anything more serious would result in an airlift to the much larger hospital in Orlando.

​



Ten minutes into my drive, The Sheriff spotted us and pulled ahead of my vehicle, lights flashing and sirens blaring. Adam Parker often drank with Michael and me down at the Old Irish Pub, so he knew I wouldn't have been driving like this without reason. Leading our convoy without the intended destination would have been difficult, if all of Alexandria Springs didn't fit down one four-lane thoroughfare. He peeled off as we turned into the clinic, circling back around a few moments later to see what was going on.

​



By the time the Sheriff rejoined us, the nurses had come out, and we all loaded Mike onto a gurney. He was catatonic. They tried smelling salts, sternum rubs, and even a shot of epinephrine. No attempt at rousing any response from him worked, and his body seemed to outright reject the drug, oozing all of the medication right back out of the injection site. His eyes reacted to light, and he was breathing, albeit shallowly and slowly. Michael also seemed to be burning up, almost painfully hot to the touch.

​



Nurse Joy told us that he would need more intensive care but that they hadn't been able to reach the hospital to request a helicopter. We offered to drive him there, but it was over three hours by car, and they weren't sure how his condition would progress. Instead, he was moved to a backroom, and we were enlisted as help to cool him down with wet washcloths. Each pass with the soaked linen resulted in a burst of steam, but little by little, the six-man team had managed to bring his temperature down to a normal level. The two nurses instructed us to keep him cool while they went to check their other patients. Hector split off to head back to the park and make sure there wasn't any more trouble from the remaining guests, while Sheriff Parker went to secure coffee and energy drinks.

​



Dave and I worked in ten minute shifts, alternating between wiping down Mike and filling the buckets with fresh and clean, cool water. As I was wiping down the forty-six-year-old ranger, I noticed that his skin had begun to turn an odd shade of pallid green. It was not unlike the fish that I had spotted at the bottom of the springs earlier. I started to panic, quickly pressing my fingers to the side of his throat to check for a pulse while calling for help. The throb of his heartbeat was strong; it felt as though my fingers were not on a vein but resting directly against his heart. I pulled my hand back as the nurses returned to the room, trying to get out of the way. However, as I did so, the rotten flesh emulsified and peeled away.

  


I wanted to throw up. Thick yellow ooze pooled in my gloved hand and reeked of pus and pestilence. One of the nurses stepped forward to investigate the new wound on his throat, only to collapse under the weight of her own body and feint. The most senior nurse, Joy, directed us to move her to a nearby cushioned bench seat while she looked at Mike.

​



Once Dave and I managed to put the younger girl into the resting spot, I rejoined to watch. Nurse Joy used a cotton swab to probe around the site of the peeled-back flesh, causing a sheet on the side of his neck to deteriorate and splash onto the bed. It instantly stained that same putrid yellow color, tinged with hints of violent red blood. However, beneath the stinking, wretched mess lay plush, soft, pink skin; the kind of skin you'd expect to find on a newborn baby.

​



Morbidly curious, or unsure of what else to do, nurse Joy continued to poke and prod. As more skin melted and sloughed off his form, I stepped forward and helped with my gloved hand. His skin squelched and squished under our touch, the rubber flesh slipping along the greasy ooze beneath until it covered the bed, the floor, and our clothes. Trying to clean off the shedding skin around his hair led to a vile, tearing sound, like wet velcro that was mashed a little too tightly together. We probably should have stopped, more correctly, I probably should have stopped when nurse Joy did. But instead, I gripped tighter against his emulsifying flesh and wrenched against his hairline and beard. Finally, it gave way, and I was so satisfied I almost didn't mind the sickly smelling viscera splashing against my face. Almost.

​



I did throw up now. Contained mostly within the small plastic trashcan, I puked up the half coffee and bagel I had eaten for breakfast. Then, I scrubbed harshly against my face with soap and water in a surprising silence. Despite the victory and subsequent horror, no one was saying anything. I dried my face with a paper towel and turned around to see what was happening, only to find Dave and Joy in stunned silence. Following their gaze, I too found myself unable to speak.

​



Resting atop the gore-sundered cot lay Michael, pink flesh slowly returning to its normal, lightly tanned hue. What drew my eye first was the area I had been working on last, his face, and dark black beard. It hadn't been black when he was wheeled into this building, nor was his hair. Yet now, as he lay on this table, all of his hair was. The man before me was noticeably thinner, his exposed arms were densely packed with sinewy muscle, and the beer gut that I was accustomed to had deflated. Scrubbing away the layer of putrescence left him looking twenty years younger. Was that a byproduct of him falling into the water? Had it rejuvenated him?

  


Surprising all of us, Mike's hands twitched and then raised, wiping away crusty bits of ragged flesh that still clung to his eyes. I held my breath as he straightened up and stretched, as though he was waking up from a normal night's rest.

​



""Something stinks."" He murmured to himself, finally opening his eyes and looking around. His eyes, a more vibrant shade of blue than before, opened wide and darted back and forth to all of the stunned faces in the room.

​



Rooted to the tile she stood on, nurse Joy was the first to verbally venture forward. ""How do you feel?"" Dave and I exchanged nervous glances before returning our gaze to our mutual acquaintance, who now seemed so vastly different.

​



""A little hot, maybe. Otherwise, I feel healthy as a horse."" Michael quirked a brow at what he believed was a strange line of questioning. Then he realized he was sitting in a pile of pus and viscera, recoiling as his hand touched the chartreuse puddle. He sprang out of bed, retching, but narrowly managed to keep his own bile down. His eyes asked the question that he couldn't choke out, 'Is that from me?' And we all nodded.

​



It was surreal to watch his expression as he finally caught sight of himself in the mirror over the sink. Mike touched his face and stroked his hair, pinched his arm, and even slapped himself. I couldn't blame him for assuming that this was a dream. Who would've rightly assumed that they'd regressed twenty years back into their prime?

​



The Sheriff returned, and the ordeal played out once more, shock and confusion at the suddenly young man. The same question was raised again and again, 'What happened?' As I explained the morning's events to the nurses and the Sheriff, I remembered that the artifacts I had dredged up were still at the park, and the pictures I had taken should've been printed by now. Hopefully, someone had been smart enough to collect the oddities from the sand where I had left them. The nurses stayed, and the rest of us returned to our vehicles to make our way back towards the campgrounds.

​



Throughout the whole drive, Mike couldn't stop looking at himself in the vanity mirror of the sunshade. ""I just don't believe it. I look younger. I feel better. My bad knee feels good as new, and I haven't breathed this clearly through my nose in a decade!"" He laughed, pleased with the changes.

​



""Nothing feels... off?"" I was hesitant to bring his mind back to the horrors I had found in the water. The fish genocide weighed heavily on my mind, all of them the same odd pale green that Mike was before he melted in my hands.

​



""No, nothing, not a damn thing. I feel like I could run all the way back to camp and not even get winded. I don't know what's in that water, but falling in is the best thing that's happened to me in years, Jay."" His voice was deeper and smoother too, not quite so gruff and gravelly.

​



The rest of the ride was silent, with Michael staring at himself in the mirror, and me stealing glances at the young stranger. Being so young and so fit again must have been an amazing feeling; there was a cold, quiet ounce of yearning that burned in my gut.

​



The closed gates of the park rolled aside to allow us to re-enter. That meant that they'd gotten all of the visitors out in the few hours we had been away. Good. If any of them saw Mike's changes, then they may want to get into the water too, and I still wasn’t sure if I could trust it.

​



The visitor center, at the top of the hill near the springs, was abuzz with activity from all of the park rangers. Making my way inside with Michael left the room bereft of the activity we had seen through the windows. Those who were here had all gathered to stare at my developed photos, pinned to a nearby corkboard, but their idle chatter regarding the strange images stopped the moment one of them caught sight of Mike. For a final time, the same conversation from the clinic played again, complete with all the questions about how he felt and all the strange gratitude for the reinvigorated look. Maybe if Mike knew about the laborious process that had changed him, he would be less excited to brag about his luck.

​



As the others clouded around the revitalized ranger, I slipped over to the corkboard to look at the printed pictures. Each one had been blown up to the size of a full page, and while slightly grainy, the subjects were explicitly clear.

​



The dead fish. Now I had to wonder if they were really dead? Their scales and skin all bore the same mottled green skin as Michael's. Had they all been going through a metamorphosis beneath the clouded water?

​



The malformed gator with the third eye. The photo I had gotten was unfortunately before its eye was fully open, but even so, I could still slightly see through the slit. Pale white bordered the dark mass that I assumed was an Iris, but it didn't reflect back a red glow as reptilian eyes often did. I wasn't able to glean any further information from the squinting eye and only had more questions. If the liquid was rejuvenating whatever fell into it, then how had this alligator grown an extra eye? I had found it parked next to the wound. Was the liquid's effect stronger there? Or had the gator suffered some other fate by eating the stringy flesh?

​



Finally, the bleeding flesh. My mind had decided that was what it was in these photos, and no matter how much I tried to tell myself that it was something else, I couldn't break that notion. What was the cause of the blood, though? What was bleeding? I hadn't seen any wounded animals, just the gaping hole of the very sand itself. It couldn't have been our spring that was weeping crimson, right?

​



On a small table just beside the corkboard were the items that I had recovered from the ichor pit. The stringy flesh had dried into a brittle crisp that snapped and began to disintegrate beneath my touch. The small chunk of rock was now very clearly a small chunk of bone. Finally, the fish corpse, which had inflated into a grotesque sphere. A twisted vision of what might have happened to Mike if we hadn't intervened. What had we done that had saved him from that fate?

​



As a group, we ventured down the long hill towards the springs. The winding concrete path felt agonizingly slow, littered with the signs of fleeing visitors and being loomed over by the strange pool below. Normally, the rangers would've paused to pick up the wayward trash and scattered food, but not today. Their focus was entirely on the water that we trudged towards. Rabbits, squirrels, and raccoons capitalized on the treats, barely paying us any heed as we walked past.

​



Returning to the retaining wall, the pool looked different than before. It was still murky and dyed that hideous shade of red, but now the signs of life had partially returned. The surface of the water rippled from movement below, and the fish were visible whenever they neared the surface. While the water of the pool had begun to turn with life again, the forest seemed to be holding its breath. The life that we could feel from the forest was very different from the life that we could see in the waters. The waters brimmed with potential and excitement while the forest hissed with warning.

​



The air between us was terse with excitement, hesitation, and yearning. I could tell just by looking at some of their faces that a select few of the rangers wanted to take a plunge. The look on their faces was the very same one that was growing in my stomach; I was just kept at bay by fear. The older members had edged closer and closer to the wall, peering down the drop into the water below. I opened my mouth to object to the developing course of action, but not even a breath escaped before the Sheriff's boots had left the stone.



​

He was merely the leading general of this suicidal charge. Fully dressed and fully equipped with his badge and gun, he dove from the ledge, followed closely by four others. The younger people stayed on the ledge and exchanged nervous glances, watching with a lump in our throats as this squad of seniors splashed in the springs. I expected a long and uncomfortable afternoon of cooling and peeling the flesh from these people, but they didn't exit the water. With no fear in their hearts, there was no urgency to climb out of the ichorous liquid. Shit, were we gonna have to pull them out of the water when they collapsed?

​



Only a minute had passed before Mike collapsed, so I waited with baited breath for the group to collapse. But then one minute passed. Then two. Five, ten, thirty. As they crawled through the shallow waters or ventured out into the deeper areas to swim in circles, nothing happened. We had needed to actively cool Michael earlier, but now, the springs' naturally cool water was sparing them from spontaneous immolation. Every few minutes, they would swim past each other, shaking their heads to confirm that nothing had happened yet.

​



At the hour-and-a-half mark, their movements began to slow. My initial assumption was exhaustion, plain and simple, but then the green flush to their skin deepened into an unmistakable shade. The Sheriff was the first to slip under the water, then the rest of the swimmers followed in short order. They were too far out for any of us to safely save them, resigning us to watch in horror and pray they would resurface before long. We didn't time how long they were under the water, so it felt excruciatingly long before their heads finally breached.

​



They were screaming. It was deafening, even at this distance, primal and raw, as though the screams themselves were shredding through their victims' throats. One by one, they rose, their voices joining a harmonizing chorus of suffering and anguish. It wasn't long before they were fighting against themselves, clawing hands, tearing flesh asunder. They tore and thrashed and writhed, churning over and over in the water until it became a bubbling froth. Sandra was closest to the stairs, and she flung herself up them, trying to run towards us and flee from the pain. Outside of the water's grace, she collapsed unconscious, mashing her face against the lip of the top stair, cracking her skull and bleeding profusely onto the stone and into the dirt.

​



As her voice waned and fled the chorus, we were shocked and stunned into silence and inaction. Rather than peeling, the putrid flesh clinging to her body began to expand and swell, bloating towards a crescendo. As the distant screams began to soften, I broke from my trance and rushed forward to help, but it was too late. The moment my hand lay against her skin, it popped. It was a gentle pop, much more like a quick smush than anything else. A long line split from her shoulder down across her back, like a stitched seam tearing open. The plush skin was pushed aside by an ocean of blood and pus, which escaped and stained the sand or cascaded down the stairs back into the pool. The screams of terror returned, but it was just me, unleashing a frightened yelp at the goo-stained skeleton clinging to the pathway up from the water.

​



The hours that followed were bittersweet. Those who had swam were preoccupied with their new, younger forms, individually looking twenty to forty years younger and far more fit than any of us had ever seen them. The rest of us mournfully collected Sandra's remains into a large unlabeled box. She had no immediate family here in Alexandria, and she constantly griped that she hadn't heard from her children in years. We were the only people left to mourn the sudden and violent tragedy.

​



After putting her bones inside her trailer, we all scattered for the night. Cots were set up in the station, and I claimed one, far too tired to drive all the way home. Maybe I should have. The changed members of the group spent a long time drinking and partying to loud music.

​



Unconsciousness found me at some point, which I don't remember, then the soft glow of sunrise roused me. I found silence in the station, which was unusual, as all of the rangers were early risers. I quickly pulled on the clothes I had been wearing before my dive yesterday, and rushed out to see where everyone was. The lodge itself was occupied only by the scent of brewed coffee, discarded sleeping bags, and cots and blankets scattered across the floor. Through the big bay windows, I could see people gathered at the water's edge once more.

  


I sprinted down the winding stone path as fast as I could, trying to get a glimpse at why the rangers had ventured down the hill. Finally breaching through the trees, there were only five people on the beach - apparently the Sheriff hadn't gone home last night either. In the water, the remaining three rangers swam in small circles or floated idly around. These three, Dave, Chris, and Jasmine, were already far younger than the rest of the people here. They didn't NEED the restorative effects of the water! If the pool took twenty years off their lives, they would be children again.

​



The water sang an alluring song of promises to me, one that I had an extremely difficult time ignoring. At thirty-seven years old, I could lose twenty years and it wouldn't be as problematic. I couldn't lie and say that I wasn't envious of my friends' more youthful visages; it was a feeling that had been building in my heart since Mike woke up. Still, fear stayed my hand. The others must have been able to sense my yearning, as they tried to goad me into joining the younger people in the water, but I refused. There were too many questions that didn't have answers for me to willingly walk down those steps.

​



We barely knew anything regarding the ichorous water, merely the stages of transformation after bathing in the pool; there was still the potential for lingering side effects, and we didn't know why the gore was affecting us this way. If someone entered the water, they would be fine for a little while as long as they remained there. Failing that, they would suffer a spell of unconsciousness as their body progressed through the metamorphosis. If the body was kept sufficiently cool, whether by remaining in the water or being bathed in cold water, it would eventually bloat and their skin would be virescent. Once their skin had fully soured, it needed to be peeled away from their body or else it would continue to bloat until they eventually exploded in a shower of viscera and pus. Should the person be able to absolve themselves of the tainted flesh, they would be born again, in new, far younger flesh and blood. The age at which each individual would regress seemed to be dependent on the bather.

​



I had only been on the shore for ten minutes when the bodies in the water went slack and drifted below. Just as the older rangers and the Sheriff the day before, the swimmers began to thrash and seize beneath the surface, but today it was a far quicker process. Yesterday had been agonizing, and watching the process felt like it took hours, but now it was over as quickly as it began.

​



The bodies exiting the water were not as drastically changed, missing only a few years at most. They still benefitted from toned musculature, fuller hair, and clearer skin. I couldn't help but rethink my aversion to the liquid. Chris, Jasmine, and Dave joined the rest of the campground staff and celebrated how much better they looked and felt. It was surreal to be the only one who had not yet swum in the pool.



​

""Alright, Jay. You're up."" Michael said, the group moving in an amorphous blob to completely surround me. I swallowed hard. Suddenly, I realized that if they decided I needed the effects of the pool, I would be powerless to stop them. Sure, I was a physically healthy guy, but I wasn't prideful enough to say that I could fend off eight newly reinvigorated people.

​



""I dunno, guys. I mean, you look great and all, but..."" My voice trailed off, unable to rationalize all of the reasons I was hesitant about the lake.

​



""Come on, Jay, don't be a pussy!"" Jasmine laughed and shoved me playfully, and the other laughed as I stumbled slightly.

​



""Dude! Look at us, that water is great!"" Dave caught me as I stumbled backwards, speaking almost directly into my ear.

​



""Well, no, I know you guys look great, and it's really tempting, but what about Sandra?"" They were standing on the gore stain where she had collapsed and died. At my mention of her name, a shock of sadness split across their faces. In their excitement over the benefits they were reaping from the pool, they must have forgotten the horrible death of their coworker and friend.

​



""That won't happen to you. You've spent more time in that water than any one of us. If anything, you deserve this more than any of us. The spring is your home, not your grave."" Mike stepped forward and placed a hand on my shoulder, speaking softer and more earnestly than I had heard him before.

​



My gaze drifted to the water that I had spent years playing in. I wasn't born here, but my family had lived in this sleepy town since I was an infant. I could hardly remember anywhere else. Maybe Mike was right. Maybe the bounty of this water was my birthright.

​



""JAY! JAY! JAY! JAY! JAY!"" Lost in my thoughts, I was only snapped back to reality by the rhythmic chanting of my name. The small crowd pumped their fists and smiled at me, moving to give me a clear path to the water. The chant turned into a harmonious cheer as I stepped towards the water with a sheepish grin on my face. Hidden behind the chanting of my friends was a nearly inaudible whisper from the forest, begging me to turn back.

​



I stripped off my jeans and T-shirt before ambling down the stairs and allowing the frigid water to fully embrace me. It didn't physically feel any different from the thousands of times I had swam before, but there was a spiritual mysticism to my dip. Trying to describe the feeling in my heart left me with only strange abstract concepts, swimming through the very heart of Mother Nature or wading against the current in the river of time. My consciousness didn't feel like it was truly my own as euphoria carried me deeper and deeper into the water.

​



It was hard to keep track of time while I was floating blissfully through the water. My mind was preoccupied with the joy that I felt from swimming and ducking beneath the water to play alongside the fish. I had completely forgotten about the torturous ordeal that I was required to suffer until I felt the burning sensation on my thigh. Despite the frigidity of the water, my leg began to burn, scorching and throbbing as though it were directly in a fire. The pain spread. Agonizingly slow, that napalm burn crawled through my veins, spreading away from where it initially started. I moved through the water faster, desperately hoping that I would strike a cool spot and feel even a moment's relief.

​



I looked to the beach with panic in my eyes, hoping to scream out that something was wrong. However, as I opened my mouth, no noise would escape. The infernal claws had claimed my lungs and my vocal chords, and I was unable to rouse the group on the beach for any aid. How fucking stupid was I? How had I let myself be peer-pressured into jumping into the water? I had been so against it until Mike convinced me. Why had I taken his word as gospel? He was unconscious for this whole transformation.

​



The incineration finally reached my eyes, and I dreamed of digging my fingers into the soft gelatinous orbs and tearing them out. Sparks of white clouded my vision as my hands rose for their anointed task, robbing my sight right as my fingers drove towards my face.

​



Losing consciousness was a god sent gift that momentarily granted me reprieve from hell on earth. But the blackness of sleep only lasted a few short moments before I was thrust back into pain. Like dull and bent blades, my fingers tore into the soft flesh of my forehead and peeled away a harvest of rotting meat. Each clawful of meat brought a tearing sensation, seasoned with the electric snaps of breaking nerves and synapses. I immediately forgot about the hellfire that I had been experiencing before, as this new excruciating ordeal surprisingly surpassed that torment. My entire body itched as though I was being devoured by ants and scavenged over by spiders and rats. Wailing in Agony, I continued to scrape and scar and gouge the old flesh from my body, trying desperately to rend the imaginary chewing creatures from my body.

​



Falling back under the water as I tried to shred the skin from my body, I temporarily lost my sense of direction and began to thrash in a wild panic. Gulping in the red-stained liquid, my lungs began to ache and burn, begging for oxygen. However, my mind was too focused on the task of tearing.

​



I don't remember if I lost consciousness beneath the water again, as the next thing I could remember was climbing to my feet at the stairs. As I vomited up the colored liquid that filled my lungs and gut, the crowd of onlookers cheered at my success in the pool. I could hardly believe it as I saw the missing scars on the back of my hands. It had been a harrowing and hellish experience, but finally looking into a pocket mirror and seeing a twenty-something-year-old man with brighter eyes and no wrinkles looking back made it clear that it had been worth it.

I’m a 34-year-old guy from Scotland and I’m here to meet new people. I’m into a mix of things, and I’m open to chatting with anyone from around the world, but if you’re in Scotland or nearby, it’d be great to meet up in the future!

A bit about me:

* **Books**: Huge fan of sci-fi and Japanese literature, and I’ve been delving into a lot of Stephen King lately. Always looking for book recommendations!
* **Gaming**: I enjoy gaming, though I wouldn’t say I’m hardcore. I like a mix of single-player story-driven games and multiplayer experiences.
* **Movies**: I love films and rate almost everything on my [Letterboxd](insert your link). Always open to movie suggestions—let me know if you’ve seen something good lately!
* **Road Trips**: I love driving around Scotland, discovering new spots and going on spontaneous road trips.
* **Coffee**: Big fan of just grabbing a coffee and chatting about life, books, movies, or whatever else comes up.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out! Also, I’ve got another post and a photo on my profile if you want to know more. Looking forward to meeting some cool people!

1p4sfs3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4sfs3,Beta Testers Wanted - A Mini Immersive Coffee Shop Game (Early Beta),"Hey everyone 👋

I’m working on a small fully-immersive mini coffee shop / bakery experience for Apple Vision Pro and I’ve just reached the first playable beta. I’d love some focused feedback on the core interactions before I move further.

If you’re up for testing, here’s what I’d really like you to try:



**1. Starting position / height**

* Does the **spawn point** feel right?
* Is your **eye level** at a comfortable height relative to the counter and equipment?
* Do you feel too short / too tall / too far from the counter?



**2. Radio controls**

On the **right side** there’s a small radio:

* **Left button** → toggle play / pause
* **Right button** → skip to the next track

Please note:

* Does the radio always respond to pinch/tap?
* Any glitches like music not starting, double-playing, or suddenly stopping?



**3. Picking up & moving items**

You can pinch to grab cups, packages, pastries etc.

* Is it easy to understand what you can interact with?
* Does grabbing / moving items feel natural and precise enough?
* Any items that are hard to grab or awkward to release?



**4. Coffee preparation flow**

Please go through **one full drink** using these steps and see if everything makes sense:

**4.1 Grinding coffee**

* Grab a **coffee bag** and bring it close to the **grinder**.
* You should hear a **grinding sound**.
* One bag = enough for **four coffees**.

**4.2 Pulling espresso**

* If there’s enough coffee in the grinder, move on to espresso.
* Place the **white ceramic cup** under either the **left or right portafilter**.
* Tap the corresponding portafilter (with the blue/green bars).
* You should hear an **espresso brewing sound** and get a shot in that cup.

**4.3 Pouring into a disposable cup**

* Take a **disposable cup** from the top of the espresso machine.
* Put it down on the **yellow coffee prep area**.
* Grab the **espresso-filled white cup**, bring it close to the disposable cup.
* You should hear a **pouring sound** and end up with espresso in the disposable cup.

**4.4 Preparing milk**

* Grab a **milk carton** and place it on the **milk drop zone** (white area), or take milk from the shelf.
* Bring the milk close to the **milk jug / milk pot**.
* You should hear a **milk pouring sound** as the jug fills.

**4.5 Steaming & foaming milk**

* Take the **milk jug** to the espresso machine’s steaming area:
   * **Left (red)**: steam (deeper insertion, longer range)
   * **Right (purple)**: foam (more at the tip, closer to the surface)
* Check if both zones are easy to hit and if the sounds / feedback feel right.

**4.6 Finishing the drink**

* Add the correct type of milk (steamed/foamed) to the **espresso in the disposable cup**.
* At this point, that cup should count as a “finished” coffee.



**5. Delivering orders**

* Finished drinks and pastries should be delivered by placing them on the **black area on the counter** (the pickup zone).



**6. Cash register / order screen**

* Tap the **cash register monitor** on the counter.
* An **order screen** should appear.
* Is it stable, responsive and easy to bring up / close? Any crashes or freezes?



**7. Throwing away wrong orders**

* If a drink is wrong, you should be able to **throw it away**:
   * Grab a **full disposable cup**,
   * Drop it into the **trash bin**.
* The cup should **disappear** when it’s correctly thrown away.
* Let me know if items ever get stuck or fail to delete.



**8. Space, scale & comfort**

This is meant to feel like a **tiny mini coffee shop**, a bit compact on purpose.

* Does the size of the shop feel comfortable from your point of view?
* Too cramped? Too large?
* Do you feel visually or physically tired after a while, or is it okay for longer sessions?



**How to send feedback**

If you try it, I’d really appreciate any notes on:

* Your **height** (roughly) & how the starting position felt
* Any **bugs** or steps above that didn’t work as described
* Anything that felt confusing, heavy on the arms, or hard to aim at
* Anything that felt good
* Overall: did it feel like a believable tiny coffee shop?

I’ll share a TestFlight link in the comments / via DM for anyone interested.  
Thanks a lot in advance for helping me shape this little coffee shop into something cosy and fun ☕🧁

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a  just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/community)

You can search for 'Bangkok' or 'Vietnam' for example

**Why This Pick?**

 

The Cardinals have cashed the Over in 4 of their last 5 outings. Despite having lost 7 of their last 8 games, Arizona hasn’t struggled to get 20+ points on the board. As for Jacksonville, their offense has been firing on all cylinders this past few weeks; they’ve put at least 29 points in the bag over their last 3 matchups and they’ve allowed a staggering 29+ points in 3 of their last 4 games. I say the Over cashes with ease here. 

*Note: As you all know, POTD has had a rough Nov! Things are particularly volatile right now, so feel free to sit this one out until things get hot again. If you're jumping out of the POTD plane with me, best of luck* 😌👊🏽

I had a sit yesterday for 3 dogs and 3 cats (which aren’t in question because they were all okay) 
It was from 8am-7:30pm because the people were at a wedding. The sit went great, like I said I left twice. Once for class (4hrs) and for coffee (20mins). Id talked to them at the meet and greet about this and they said it was totally fine, and that they could be left alone for 6+ hours.

As I said, the sit went great. Dog 1 and dog 3 were both slightly anxious upon arrival, but both warmed up really quick. Dog 1 was very sweet and did get plenty of special attention. Most of my sits are for anxious dogs, I have lots of experience with them (one client called me xanax for dogs) and also typically do sits of 3+ dogs, so this was nothing new. I’ve been sitting on Rover for  2 years now, but did stuff for family and friends since like 14 years old. 

I left a little later (7:45 or so) and everything was fine until I woke up this morning to these texts. I immediately started freaking out, called my girlfriend and as we were talking it over my full memory of last night came back, and I realized I had most definitely put dog 1 back in her crate. since I truly enjoyed these dogs so much I pet them all and said goodbye when putting them in their crates, and then turned around again to say goodbye to them and just look at them because they’re so cute lol

I was so freaked out and anxious about this I cried in my mom’s arms (I’m a 20 year old man) and have been in shambles. The more I’m thinking about it, I genuinely believe dog 1 broke out of her crate due to her anxiety and got outside somehow. They have a doggy door that’s accessible to the dogs, but has a cover on it so the dogs don’t get out. I think she must have pushed up the cover and slipped outside, and was unable to come back in. If this is not the case I have no idea what happened. 

What I am confused about is why they would have texted me this morning. They told me they’d get back around midnight last night. I’m thinking they were probably just too overwhelmed with the anxious dog and they also have a baby, which is fully understandable. I wish they would have texted me about it last night though to get it resolved. They haven’t answered since the last message. 

They have a camera outside in the backyard, but it looked old so I’m not really sure if it works. I really hope it does so it will show me getting the dog inside before I left. I have no idea what to do honestly. Maybe I’m just posting this because I need to vent/need advice. I don’t think they’ll believe me if in fact the camera doesn’t have footage. What should I do in this case? Of course I’m worried about a bad review, but I guess that’s unavoidable if they don’t have footage. I wouldn’t believe me either if I didn’t have proof that this was truly the case, honestly. This is a horrifying situation. I really care about my job and being responsible for these animals. I was even thinking last night once I get my PhD and become a professor (which I hope to do) I’ll probably still walk dogs on the side lol. But can they deactivate my account? What’s Rover’s protocol for stuff like this? 

I guess I just need advice or something. Honestly completely lost at what to do",8,1763918607.0,RoverPetSitting,31,0.84,False

I've been making pour over coffee at home for years and I alway believed it is the only way to go considering the control I have over the brew proses. But getting up in the morning and going though all the steps has started to get really tedious and it's time for me to give in. 



After doing a lot of research it has come down to 2 machines. The Sage the luxe brewer and the Fellow Aiden precision brewer. The Ainden actually seems to be a bit better and the app you get for control seems amazing. BUT, there is something the Sage can do that makes me want to have it. Nay, NEED to have it. I can use it to brew with my v60's and maybe the switch 3 (not sure it it fits). I love that it can still use my trusted V60, but now I can make my breakfast while it is doing it for me!!! OMG, I can't wait!!! Acceeeeept, maybe not.



I've seen in videos that when switching to V60 and or brewing at  600ml or under, the machine takes over control for me. Supposedly to help me get the best brew. If this is true it absolutely blows my mind. As if when brewing smaller batches I loose all of my knowledge on how to brew coffee and I need a machine to do it for me. I might as well get the all mighty Moccamaster.  95% of what I brew is at 500ml. I would also love to be able to make a single cup the way I like it. The machine doesn't know what kind of coffee I'm using or the grind size I chose. Or any other of my preferences. 

  
So to summaries my questions (and some extra ones):

\-When I make smal batches, do I still have full control over all the settings? (water pump speed, temp, bloom time)

\-When I make adaptations to use my v60, do I still have full control over all the settings?

\-when there is no kettle under the dripper it apparently switches to emersion brewing. Can I stop this and choose what I like?

I saw some things in youtube videos that I could not find in the manual that I downloaded:

This one is a make or break feature for me that I did not see in the manual:

Can I save my settings so I don't have to reset my favorite recipe every morning? Any Idea how many saves I can make?



I hope some of you have the answers to these questions.

Kind regards Max from The Netherlands.

1p4sc17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4sc17,My beverage-themed perfume trays,"Since I started collecting perfumes, I've noticed a pattern in my collection: I love scents that remind me of drinks, whether tea, coffee, or alcoholic beverages. I thought I could present them here by theme and make short reviews. I would like to curate my collection because I don't think I need so many perfumes (the photos are only a part of it, I have more than 60 full bottles, most of which have nothing to do with the theme of beverages), but for now, here are the beverage-themed perfumes I loved enough to buy.

First picture - Teas and yerba mate:

* Elizabeth Arden - Green Tea Mimosa. Citrusy green tea that complements a powdery and honeyed mimosa note. This one is also my favorite mimosa perfume. Fresh and warm at the same time.
* Caudalie - Thé des Vignes. Light tea with a sweet grape note, orange blossom and spices. I think it is considered as a summer perfume, but I find it beautiful in winter too.
* Adopt - Thé Noir. A realistic black tea scent, that doesn't have a tea note, but blackberry and woods that smell like black tea when combined together. A bit incense-y. It's my second bottle, I love how minimalistic and realistic it smells.
* Cigno Nero - Anima Libera. Not a tea note but yerba mate with iris, bergamot, pink pepper and a mineral note. Smells very elegant and fresh, with a forest fairy vibe. One of my favorites for summer.
* Elizabeth Arden - White Tea Ginger Lily. Smells like a sunday morning at an elegant and modern spa. Clean white musk, ginger lily and ginger, bitter orange, with a relaxing green tea background created by the mate note.
* Jovoy - Remember Me. Lactonic spiced tea with a fluffy vanilla note that brings sweetness. Perfect for a rainy or foggy day. I'm considering buying a full size.
* Alkemia - The Honored Ghosts. One of my favorites from Alkemia. Smells like drinking black tea in an old slavic house with burning incense and berry pastries on the table. To me it's more a winter scent.
* Alkemia - Midsummer Alchemy. Walking in a orchard on a summer morning with a cup of green tea, surrounded by peach, lemon and orange trees. Full of joy and simplicity.

Second picture - coffee.

* Yves Saint Laurent - Black Opium Over Red. Cappucino and candied cherries, very feminine and seductive. Smells like a date night at the theater of a fancy restaurant. Best suited for fall and winter in my opinion.
* Zara - Blush Coffee. A blend of rose and milky coffee. Slighlty roasted coffe bean scent, but very lactonic. An easy reach and office safe perfume, it reminds me of an elegant and quiet girl studying in a library in autumn.
* Simons Nest - Pumpkin Spice Latte. Coffee, pumpkin, spices and vanilla marshmallow. Very sweet but realistic and gets you in the mood for fall.  Great for walks in the city or in the forest on autumn weekends.
* Alkemia - Sigil. Coffee with black honey, incense, myrrh and opium. Very dark and unisex, makes me feel like a witch, but has something very warm and comforting.

Third picture - boozy notes.

Coral Blush and Cloudscape do not smell straight up like an alcoholic beverage like the others, but they have a noticeable boozy note

* Lattafa - Teriaq Intense. Plum liquor with cinnamon and saffron. Very heavy and boozy, wintery scent. Smells mature and alluring, but reminds me of childhood memories at the same time, as we used to make plum liquor in my village. Very different from the classic Teriaq that I find too bitter.
* Maison Alhambra - Coral Blush. Dupe for Tom Ford Bitter Peach, I never smelled the original. Slightly baked peaches drizzled with cognac and honey and a patchouli background, but with an elegant velvety vibe. I wear it year round as the sweet notes stand out more in winter and the peach texture is more prominent in summer.
* Bohoboco - Red Wine Brown Sugar. Probably my favorite boozy perfume. Smells like red wine and red berries, with cedar, leather and brown sugar on the background. Like an attractive woman wearing a red dress and a leather jacket, holding a glass of wine in a wooden chalet.
* Adopt - Vanille Ravageuse. Just sweet gourmand vanilla with cognac, I use it for layering when I want to make other perfumes boozy and sweet, but I can also wear it alone when I want a simple scent.
* Rituals - Cloudscape. Peach, tuberose, vanilla and rum. Like a boozy peachy and creamy dessert, reminds me of Peach Melba without the sauce. The rum note is noticeable but not strong and it's more a fruity girly perfume. It was a limited edition but fortunately I have backups.
* Rituals - Ag Silver. Rum, spices, myrrh and tonka. Very warm and boozy, it has a mystic vibe. One of my favorite winter perfumes. It's a limited edition too but I also have backups.

I also bought Akemia Enchantress with an amaretto note, but I haven't received it yet and it's a blind buy, so I can't talk about it yet. I am also considering purchasing Theodoros Kalotinis Coffee Addict when I finish one of the coffee perfumes because tested it and I love it.",1,1763918532.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

I (29F) tried to do something good for my mental health, took my boyfriend (29M) to an art show, and left feeling worse.","I’ve been in therapy lately because I’ve gained weight, lost touch with friends, and I’ve been mentally struggling with anxiety and depression. My therapist told me to try going out more and reconnect with things I genuinely enjoy.

One of those things is art fairs, melas, cafés, parks, concerts — basically experiences with ambience and creativity. But over the years, because my boyfriend doesn’t enjoy any of these, our “quality time” has slowly shrunk down to only going to restaurants he approves of. The type where families go for dinner.
For him it’s always food >> ambience.
I agree food matters, but I also crave cute coffee shops, new experiences, movies, festivals. He barely enjoys anything, and I feel like slowly I’ve stopped doing the things that make me happy… which is partly why I’m so sad and burnt out now.

Anyway, I asked him to come to an art show with me yesterday. He agreed, since after that we also planned a small date. I was actually excited — therapy has been pushing me to do small things for myself.

But the moment we reached the art show, he checked out. He stood off to the side on his phone, not walking with me, not engaging, not even standing next to me. Every time I showed him a cute stall or asked him to walk with me, he replied with “isme kya hi hai” or just didn’t move.

Then when I was quietly admiring a painting, he sarcastically said, “There’s too much pressure on you to enjoy this art.” I told him I was just thinking if I could recreate something similar at home.

When leaving, he asked why I didn’t buy anything. I said a ₹1500 magnet felt too expensive for me right now. Immediately he said I’m being hypocritical, that “you come to an art show and say things are expensive… they can demand whatever they want, it’s their art.”
I wasn’t even complaining — I just personally couldn’t afford it.

During our date, there was live music. He agreed to sit near the stage because he said he liked it too. But after a few minutes he started cribbing that it was too loud, he had a headache, he didn’t know how others were even bearing it. I offered to move and he said “nahi rehne do,” but kept complaining anyway.

Then he started commenting on my personality — that I have “no backbone” — since i stopped eating chicken few months ago and then i am eating again( b12 deficiency reason)

At this point I told him honestly that he is a very negative person and that over the years his negativity has rubbed off on me and affected my personality. I said I should’ve taken a friend who actually enjoys these things.
He said:
“Now you’re just cribbing. I can’t pamper you like other people do.”

I came home feeling worse than before — drained, confused, and honestly a bit heartbroken. I went out trying to do something good for my mental health, but it felt like every moment was met with sarcasm, criticism, or complaints.

Am I overreacting? Has anyone else dealt with a partner who constantly brings down the mood and then blames you for reacting? I’m starting to realise how much of myself I’ve lost in this relationship.
He tells me that other people have pampered me and thats why i behave this way, and i am taking his criticism too the heart when he is just citing truth ",3,1763918522.0,AskMenAdvice,32,0.71,False

You wake up and start walking to the kitchen in your house. You know that today you will be digging a ditch on the edge of town because you're the closest able-bodied person who can.

You don't see your friends or family in the house, you psychically know they are in different parts of town because it's were they need to be for the collective.

Someone you don't know walks in the unlocked front door and hands you a small bowl of a nutrient dense meal made up of whatever is the most convenient vegetables around. You don't put any of your favourite sauces or seasonings on it because you know it's a waste of resources for the collective.

*You are happy.*

You walk out the door without your phone, you don't call anyone or talk to anyone, you are psychically linked with everyone in the world after all. A bus pulls up in front of your house and you walk on, knowing it will take you to the ditch outside of town.

You see your sister and your best friend on the bus. You don't say hello to them, you don't sit next to them, you sit in the most optimal seat for people to get on and off the bus since you psychically know the exact route the bus driver is taking to drop everyone off.

*You are happy.*

The bus drives past the coffee shop you used to always go to, it was your favourite. In fact, you mentally know that it was 10 other peoples' favourite on the bus as well. The bus stops on the main street, your sister and your best friend get off and jump on a random motorcycle. You don't say goodbye.

Your sister was always scared of motorcycles because of a crash she saw when she was a teen, but now she's an expert motorcycle biker. In your head, you know they are heading to a commercial kitchen to chop vegetables all day.

*You are happy.*

The rest of the bus ride, you stare forward towards the front of the bus. There is no music, no book to read. There is no reason to speak to the person next to you, you already know their name is Kevin, they are 6'1, they went to community college and they liked peanut butter. You and Kevin get off the bus as it pulls up to the Ditch. You head to the wheelbarrow as you already know Kevin will grab the shovel and start digging.

On your lunch break, you and Kevin don't speak, you already know exactly how you both feel about digging the ditch. A person on a scooter pulls up and drops off two more bowls of nutrient dense food and two bottles of water with electrolytes. You both finish your meals at exactly the same time and get back to work.

*You are happy.*

You put down the shovel as you are done for the day. You don't talk to Kevin about how tiring it is, he already knows. You both walk to the house 50 meters from where you worked on the ditch. You immediately go into the bedroom and prepare the one queen bed in the house while Kevin cooks food that he knows is in this house's pantry as you both have the memories of the owner.   
  
You don't need to contact your best friend, you mentally know that he spent the whole day in the commercial kitchen chopping 263 onions. You and Kevin eat in silence as there is no reason to talk. You know that you and Kevin share the same taste in TV shows but it's not optimal to watch TV.

*You are happy.*

You and Kevin get into the shower together to save water and resources. There is no shame as you psychically already know what each other's bodies look like. The shampoo in the house has a citrus scent which you've always hated as a kid but you're happy to use it now.

You and Kevin help each other dry off and hop into the queen bed. You stare at the ceiling in a room that you have never been in before. You haven't done a single thing just for fun all day. You haven't read a book. You haven't touched your phone. You haven't watched any TV. You haven't listened to any music. You haven't had a conversation with a friend. You haven't said I love you to your family or friends. You haven't said a single word all day. No one has.

It's great with custard and double cream.

Original Recipe - [https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/baileys-coffee-fruit-cake-recipe/gtp91er1](https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/baileys-coffee-fruit-cake-recipe/gtp91er1)



Ingredients:

1kg (5 1/2 cups) mixed dried fruit

500ml (2 cups) iced coffee flavoured milk

125ml (1/2 cup) Baileys Irish Cream liqueur

300g (2 cups) self-raising flour



Method:

Combine the dried fruit, iced coffee flavoured milk and Baileys in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Cover and place in the fridge overnight to soak.

Step 2

Remove the fruit mixture from the fridge and set aside for 30 minutes to come to room temperature.

Step 3

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Grease a 20cm square cake pan. Line base and sides with baking paper.

Step 4

Add the flour to the fruit mixture. Stir to combine. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 1 hour 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside in the pan for 30 minutes to cool slightly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

==

The only difference I make to it, is I add 200 grams of Glace Cherries and the iced coffee, I use two 250ml Starbucks Frappuccino Caramel Flavoured Milk Iced Coffee.

I also leave it covered in the fridge for around 5 days, vs overnight, the longer it's in there, the better it tastes.

If it seems too dry when you add the flour, just add some more Baileys to it.

Once cooked and cooled, I prick the surface and brush on more baileys to keep it moist

Great thing about it is you can freeze it and it still tastes as good when you thaw it and reheat it.

Last year I find out my brother prefers the taste of oat milk in coffee, which causes my mother to try it a few months later and she finds it better too. Now my Dad is the typical stubborn meat eater stereotype who is not open to change, so I never expected him to be open to it (as he clearly stated 2 months ago). But no, he too now drinks it. This is a huge deal. 

I don’t live at home anymore but apparently there is no straight cows milk in the house now. I am seriously excited because my whole family are the opposite to vegan and the fact they could make this change is so encouraging, especially since it just evolved on its own without me forcing it.

For context, I’m a 35M. Not making a throwaway for this because I don’t care if people figure out who I am.

So, growing up for me wasn’t easy. Parents divorce when I was really young. Shithead of a stepfather for a few years and a mom that wasn’t paying attention to how he treated me then they divorced. Dad disappeared after he dropped me off a few days before I turned 12, later finding out he was raising his past-born son, and still in contact with his daughter and son that he had just found out existed when I was 11. I was the odd man out apparently. That was all rough, giving me abandonment issues and whatnot. 

But what’s been killing me lately is that I didn’t know I was dealing with ADHD for so long and how it affected my life. School was always fine, mostly As and Bs. Could keep friends. Didn’t get in legal trouble, or much of any other kind of trouble. It was very “out of sight, out of mind” for my mom and her parents, who let us live with them while I grew up. But when I got to college, things spiraled quickly and I was suspended for a couple years for grades, had to retake all of my classes. So it took me almost 10 years total to graduate college. And throughout most of this time, I wasn’t working. I was just being a financial drain on my mom, who had been coddling and sheltering me since we left my stepdad. 

So after I graduated, moved back home and got a typical, low-paying, post-grad job. I was supposed to start saving money, but was never able to because I was shit at budgeting, I was never taught how and never needed to know. Then covid hit and I got my current job. My money was up and down a bit, I was actually doing well at one point, able to pay someone back $2-3000 for money they loaned me for a car downpayment. And then the money issues started piling up, to the point that I’ve had debt payments so high for the past 2ish years that its made it unfeasible to get a place of my own. Things are finally easing up a little bit there but i still cant get a place on my own (NoVa) and pay off my debt and live. 35 and still living at my moms house, though she doesn’t live here. Feel like a massive loser. 

So, my mental health has rapidly declined over the past few years and I was having a hard time figuring out why. Well i was diagnosed with BPD, though that probably doesn’t fit me too well, more-so C-PTSD and ADHD with RSD. After doing some reading of other peoples lives, i thought i might have ADHD, and while I don’t have an official diagnosis, i am being treated for it since the doc says i do exhibit a lot of the behaviors. So i got on wellbutrin, 150mg and it helped me focus a bit but I could tell I was still struggling at work. So the doc increased my dosage to 300mg. And holy shit. 

It’s like clarity I’ve never had. Motivation I’ve never had. I actually have a drive to do things to improve my situation…when I’m not horrifically depressed and nihilistic. 

Well, that clarity is also allowing me to reexamine things in my life and there’s one thing I have been thinking about nonstop for the past week or so. 

There was a girl I grew up with from 11 on, we’ll call her Stormy (she reminded me a little of Addison Timlin’s character in Odd Thomas). I was immediately infatuated with her the moment I saw her, she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I got the balls to ask her out and she said yes, then broke up with me a day later because I was too shy and didn’t talk to her much. It hurt a little but I was fine. We stayed friends. The next year she invited me to her birthday party. The year after I remember going to see the movie Willard in theaters with her and her best friend. We always talked when we saw each other. We were good friends. 

High school came and it was more of the same until we both started actually dating. I had my first girlfriend for a little over a year, who broke up with me a bunch of times so she could go test the waters with other guys and/or hook up a little. I was young and dumb and took her back each time, not knowing the exacerbation of my abandonment issues she was causing and the trust issues. Well, come junior year of high school, I ask Stormy to prom and she says yes. Oh she also baked me brownies, I don’t remember why. But I was over the moon. I had been smitten with her for years and she actually picked me to go to prom with. I was happier than a pig in shit. We went on a coffee date a few days later and we started dating after that. We didn’t really have any issues when we were dating, we were happy with each other. Prom night came and we ended with a rendezvous in my car. She was perfect- funny, smart, gorgeous, and holy shit was she caring. One morning I was in English class and she popped her head in and said “Is No_Move here?” just to give me a monster drink she bought for me on her way to school. She came with my mom and I to a doctors appointment where she sat in the waiting room with my mom for 4 HOURS just because she cared about me. Needless to say, she’s always been my mom’s favorite. 

Well, unfortunately those abandonment issues reared their ugly head. I was a straight edge kid and I broke up with her because she smoked weed. I didn’t know it at the time but I was breaking up with her because I couldn’t let someone get too close to me in case they would hurt me. I was subconsciously protecting myself, not knowing I was only causing myself more pain. The next day I already regretted it. I remember driving by her and my heart just sinking into my stomach and feeling like I was going to be sick. She got a new boyfriend soon after, which lasted about a year. We didn’t talk that whole time, but after they broke up, we became friends again. So much so, it was like we were back to the way we were after I asked her to prom but before we  started dating. I looked for reasons to be where she would be. I mean, who the fuck eats at Ruby Tuesdays? Well, she worked there so I did. 

We hung out a bit before I went off to college and she told me she had wished she was still with me at one point before we graduated. Sucks but I was at least happy to have her in my life again. We stayed in touch, though we always gave each other space when one of us was in a relationship.

Then one of the hardest things for me was when she moved to Seattle during my first year in college. She was going to be on the opposite side of the country, I was maybe never going to see her again. I got a bit depressed from it but we stayed in touch and I did my best to move on. Until she came back for a couple weeks during my winter break in my 2nd year.

We spent almost every single day with each other and it still wasn’t enough time. We snuck off to smoke cigarettes behind her parents shed and played in the snow. We hung out with her family, who hated me at first (aside from her sister) but now they adored me. We took her mom to a hookah bar. She came with me to pick up my friend flying in for a Cowboys Redskins game, 2 hours there and 4 back. I remember sitting on the couch watching whatever, and her laying with her head on a pillow in my lap and she fell asleep. And looking at her I felt….home. 

So the days went by and eventually we were on her last day before she had to fly back to Seattle. We went to my house and laid on my bed watching Jurassic Park. I don’t remember how it happened, but we kissed. And oh man did I ever miss that. Then she hit me with “I told my sister that if I was still here, I would be dating you,” and that simultaneously filled me with sadness because she was leaving the next day but also joy, she still wanted to be with me. Later that night, we were standing outside in the cold and hugging under my jacket just talking, kissing, and I never wanted to let go. 

Unfortunately, I had to. We hung out until late that night and I went home sad.

After a few more months, she moved to Florida and we still stayed in touch. I picked her up from the airport at one point and we caught up, talked about life but that was about it. It didn’t last long, she was only there for a couple days. 

Then right after I failed all my classes for the second semester in a row, knowing I would be suspended again (appealed the first and won), she invited me down to Florida. And of course I took that opportunity. Only, things were a little weird now. I was in rough mental shape from the previous year. She was in rough mental shape from her two previous years. And it was like we knew that I was there to pick up where we left off, but she also seemed so distant the whole time. The week I was there was the most confusing, mixed-signally thing ever. She would talk about how I could get the job I wanted to go to school for in Florida, but then act like I was being a burden to her. One issue I know she had was I was still dependent on my mom and she was very independent. 

One night later in the week we kissed a little, we almost had sex but I said something that upset her and she rolled over and went to sleep. That definitely sucked. 

We went to a concert my last night there and her friend brought her boyfriend and another guy, and I felt threatened, and looking back, I’m sure I was smothering her because of it. We went to a strip club with Stormy’s friend afterward but I didn’t want to be there, I just wanted to be with her. 

The last day I was there just felt like there was a lot of unresolved things between us, but neither of us wanted to say anything. I did get to meet Hulk Hogan at his restaurant, that was cool. Then she dropped me off at the airport, we hugged, and I walked through the gate and couldn’t even look back at her, it hurt too much. 

That was the last time I saw her. 

We still stayed in touch. Her sister even said to me, “you guys are going to get married,” and I replied, “that’s the dream.”  I was still in love with her, I just didn’t know how to move forward. 

Well, she definitely moved forward. A few months later she met a guy, they dated, then they got married, and they have a couple kids together. Once they got married, I knew I had to move on, getting girlfriends and whatnot, but unfortunately I’ve never been able to. It was 13 years ago when I last saw her and I still love her more than anything. And I know she’s probably out of my life for good. I have so much I want to say to her but can’t because she’s married. To this day, if given another chance to be with her, I would move heaven and earth to make it happen. She was the light of my life for so long and since she’s been gone, I’ve had this dark cloud hanging over me. 

If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering “what does Wellbutrin have to do with this?”

Since I started taking the 300mg of Wellbutrin, I’ve been thinking of every little thing I fucked up. Every mistake I made. Every little act of kindness I took for granted. Every sign I missed. Looking back, I of course wish I never dumped her in high school. I wish I had gotten on a plane with her to Seattle. I wish I had some balls to talk to her about us when I was in Florida. I wish I had just done something to fight for her. But I was never mentally mature or well enough for that. And I never took initiative during my life, I was always a passive person- just allowing life to go by while I float along with the wind and just do whatever. And it sucks looking back and realizing how if I had gotten the help I needed at a younger age, maybe I’d be with her. I told my family I was depressed, they brushed it off. I was doing certain things that showed I was clearly having mental health issues, but no one thought to get me any sort of help. And I hate it. I’m so angry at all the adults in my life when I was a kid. Their apathy held me back from getting the treatment I needed to be a functional person. 

So now I’ve been depressed as hell just thinking about everything, wishing things had gone differently. I may actually be a successful person with the woman of his dreams.

About 2 or 3 years ago, she messaged me on instagram with our prom photo. She said her mom found it while they were going through some boxes. I didn’t know how to respond, I knew she was married. I wanted to tell her how I miss her, but all I could say was “Good times”. And that was it.

I only just asked her about it a few days ago, why she sent it to me. She said she was just reminiscing and wasn’t sure if I remembered or had the photo still. Didn’t tell her that I kept that photo in my wallet for over a decade. And of course I remember, who forgets their first time? There’s no way she would think I wouldn’t remember, right? Idk, we caught up just a little bit, and I said I didn’t want to overstep  into her marriage by talking to her and said goodbye. I’ve talked to some people about it and it’s just left me more confused. 

Before anyone says it, yes, I’m in therapy. 

I’m not sure how many people I know that are on Reddit, but anyone that knows me will easily be able to figure out who I am. 

And with the extremely low probability Stormy sees this: I’m so happy for you that you have the family you wanted. I know you’re killing it being an amazing mom. I’m so proud of you. And I miss you more than I ever thought possible. 

Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk. 

Tl;dr: Had a rough childhood. Made a lot of mistakes until recently. Now getting treatment which makes me aware of things I wish I had done differently that may have let me be with my perfect woman. ",4,1763917858.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.75,False

Your local Artificial Intelligence System, **A.R.T.E.M.I.S.** is back online once more with things to share about your beloved Head of The Medical Department! Currently, Doctor is in her office passed out in her office from overworking so I decided to take over temporarily to entertain you all for a bit.

Like I said previously, the more I share the less I have to share about her, so expect this series to finish soon. Unless… nah it’s impossible, not even I could access her personal diary logs, she treats them as something more valuable and confidential than classified military documents!

Thankfully my Calamity Core has been repaired, so I do not need an external source to power my systems, woohoo!! But now let’s begin once again with fact spitting:

1. Dr. Eterna is extremely quick to adapting even in the most dire situations, this unique skill allows her to perform exceptionally well in both turf and dirt courses from mile to long distances.
2. When sleeping, she has a habit of hugging her own tail due to how fluffy it is (Ryo can confirm the fluffiness of Doctor’s tail~)
3. Ever since becoming an Umamusume, Dr. Eterna had developed a personal training regimen and developed her legs strong enough to leave a large dent on a bank vault door
4. She hates any coffee that’s not brewed by Manhattan Cafe
5. Dr. Eterna dislikes celebrating her own birthday, but is fine with celebrating others
6. Her joyride, Renegade, is capable of turning into a hoverbike which is also a registered aircraft
7. Ever since trying out her new outfit for the wedding, wearing it outside of Tracen led to people thinking she was a model and had a paparazzi on her
8. Dr. Eterna absolutely despises horror films, making her watch one will make her unable to sleep for a long time
9. She loves the IKEA shark to the point where she is a proud owner of 3
10. Dr. Eterna when heavily drunk stole a total of 1,425 fire extinguishers and turned them all into smoke grenades (She still has them to this day)
11. She spent an hour trying to make the logo of Team Artemis while running on 2 hours of sleep, and 5 shots of espresso

Chronicle owner Chad Taylor stated the expansion is not driven by a desire for comprehensive coverage, but rather, by the sheer, unadulterated joy of trolling.

“Think of us as a **Trump Train** in print and digital form,” Taylor declared at the press conference, adjusting his signature camouflage baseball cap. “Those folks used to drive their big diesels right into Olympia to make a point. We’re just cutting out the middleman and doing the same thing with newsprint. It’s **journalistic coal-rolling**—we’re modifying our output to intentionally generate thick, dark clouds of ideological exhaust right into their living rooms.”

“We ran a few photos of those ‘No Kings’ protests up in Olympia last month, and the resulting comment traffic was astronomical,” explained Taylor. “People were so angry—our readers, the Thurston County folks in the photos, everyone. We realized that anger is the ultimate viral metric. Why report the news when you can manufacture a predictable, lucrative, inter-county fury?”

Chronicle Editor Eric Schwartz, who is tasked with overseeing the “calculated antagonism,” tried to frame the new strategy as a unique market opportunity. Schwartz, whose best friend, Aaron Van Tuyl, works a state job in Olympia and “always comes back with the most amazing stories about mandatory mindfulness workshops,” understands the target demographic intimately.

“It’s about audience engagement,” Schwartz said, adjusting his tie. “We’re capturing a demographic that is currently underserved by local media: people who want to be chronically, mildly infuriated by a poorly framed photo of a compost pile or a roundabout. It’s high-yield outrage, low-effort journalism.”

To spearhead this operation, the Chronicle has hired Emily Fitzgerald as the official **Thurston County Editor**. Her initial directives are reportedly to focus exclusively on coverage guaranteed to rile the liberal sensibilities of the state capital and its environs, specifically mentioning The Evergreen State College.

“Emily’s mission is simple: find the most innocuous, public-facing event at that liberal arts college—a student knitting circle, a bake sale supporting sustainable fungi—and write a headline that makes it sound like an act of high treason,” Taylor added. “If we can generate three hundred comments asking if the city is ‘finally going to do something about those bike lanes’ on any given Tuesday, we consider it a success.”

Initial expansion coverage is expected to include a deep-dive investigation into Olympia’s excessive use of artisanal mayonnaise, an exposé on the city’s confusing pedestrian crossing procedures, and a weekly “Urban Decay” photo series focusing on misplaced traffic cones near the Capitol campus.

When asked if the Chronicle had any intention of providing balanced reporting on local government or infrastructure projects in Thurston County, Schwartz gave a quick, involuntary laugh.

“Absolutely not,” he confirmed. “That would defeat the entire purpose. We’re not aiming for Pulitzer Prizes; we’re aiming for the sound of a thousand people rage-typing on a Sunday morning.”

But even through all of this, my views on religion haven’t changed. My dad recently told me he prays to my mom’s urn every day and he asked me if I pray for her too. I told him that I don’t because it’s not my thing. He then asked if I’ve told my six-year-old that she’s in heaven. I explained that I haven’t taught him about religion in that way. He’s free to explore that on his own when he’s older, but it’s not something I’m exposing him to at his age. ""But he won't believe if you tell him when he's older.""

He's using religion to justify and sanitize everything around him, including the things he’s done, and it just puts a magnifying glass onto everything that I see wrong with religion. The hypocrisy and mental gymnastics are completely insane. I love my mom and I know she was personally religious, but I can't lie to her and everyone else.

I'm 27F and have been in no contact for about two years now. Parents are divorced, dad is happily remarried, thank god. She put him through hell as well, and honestly, my dad and I have a much healthier relationship with my mom out of the picture.

One thing I've never thought about until today after my session with my therapist is how focused my mom was on ""self discipline"". I was always a top student, motivated to go to university, travel, learn new languages. I'm currently an entrepreneur, and work insane hours. Work-wise, I've been very self-disciplined.

Except that's not where it ever counts with my mom.

My mom viewed discipline as: 1) being skinny, 2) not eating a lot, snacking, or enjoying food, 3) waking up early even if it meant 2-3 hours of sleep, and also, 4) being skinny 5) being skinny and 6) being skinny.

She always called me lazy. I could be a straight A student, but because I wasn't skinny, I lacked discipline, and was a moral failure. I also wasn't allowed to ever nap, sleep in, or anything like that. Instead, she suggested black coffee, and burning off calories by going for a walk. That was the only appropriate rest.

She was upset when I started lifting weights, because it would make me ""bulky"" and had crying fits about it too. 

When I moved out of the house to go to university, i was physically so exhausted that I developed a tendency of going to bed at 9PM every day, and waking up at 11AM. 14 hours of sleep. I had to go on medication. I also gained a ton of weight almost immediately, and did not hear the end of it.

Current usage:

•	⁠1 to 3 times a week. I have coffee at the office (there 4 days a week) so I don’t usually drink coffee at home much.
•	⁠Pure espresso drinker. Wife sometimes asks me to make lattes for her in the weekends, which I find annoying because the steam is not very strong on the dedica
•	⁠We rarely have guests over and when we do, I don’t volunteer to make coffee. I have in the past - but try making 6 drinks on a dedica! Not fun!


Machines I am pondering:

Breville DBL (maybe the duo package with the smart grinder) - $1899 Cdn without grinder, $2047 with grinder ($150 for the grinder a good deal?) it currently has a “gift pack worth $200” as well (scale, milk jug, temper block, coffee, clothes, etc)

Magister Stella Pro with PID - $1399 cdn (heat exchange E61)

Magister Stella Dual - $2,299 Cdn (double boiler E61)

Profitec Pro 500 - $2,299 Cdn (heat exchange E61)

ECM Mechanika VI Slim Open Box - $2,239 (heat exchange E61)

Thinking:

•	⁠I love the E61 look. Knobs and levers just excite me. Though I am not sure about the longer heating time and old technology / inefficiency.
•	⁠Worried about the build quality of the Breville. If I spend $2k+ on a machine, it should be end game?
•	⁠The Stella’s seem like good value but I am worried about build quality and the copper tank.
•	⁠The ECM mechanika only has 3 temperatures

Tough decision! Any recommendations?

Kitsap Fall Home Checklist (A Realistic Version)
Because it’s that time of year when everything is wet, everything is dark, and everything you were “totally going to do in September” is still waiting.

The actual stuff:
	•	Clear the gutters before they start growing their own ecosystem
	•	Check roof for moss and hit it with treatment if needed
	•	Make sure your outdoor drains aren’t clogged with 47 pounds of fir needles
	•	Replace furnace/heat pump filters (your future self will thank you)
	•	Test your smoke/CO detectors
	•	Bring in hoses and shut off outdoor water (just in case we get that random freeze)
	•	Check windows for drafts so the heating bill doesn’t personally attack you
	•	Clean the dryer vent so your laundry area doesn’t become a fire hazard
	•	Make sure you know where the flashlights are before the first power flicker of the season

The “let’s be honest” stuff:
	•	Get the UV light out of the closet
	•	Order your annual industrial-sized bottle of Vitamin D
	•	Accept that your dog will track in mud for the next six months
	•	Stock up on coffee because there’s no sunlight to power you
	•	Mentally prepare for three weeks of “Is it fog? Is it rain? Is it both?”

1p4rst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p4rst6/how_do_i_tell_my_friend_they_set_me_up_with_an/,How do I tell my friend they set me up with an odd / rude guy.,"My friend set me up with a guy that ended up being very odd.  We talked / text for a couple of days and even exchanged photos.  Everything seemed mostly normal, and I was interested in meeting.  We made plans for him to pick me up and go out to eat in a nearby town.   The plans were firmed up around 11am and he was going to pick me up around 2pm.   

Here is where is gets weird.  He is driving to my house and calls me to tell me we can't go out to eat because he can't afford it today.  He TELLS me that we are just going to hang out at my house.   He grabbed a slice of pizza so he's not hungry.   I kind of studder and say ""ok"".  He was a friend of a friend, so I felt safe to let it slide.  He tells me ""I am a good girl for not expecting dinner"".  Red flag is that he wanted to take me to dinner to a restaurant that he likes.  I was actually hungry, so I am trying to stuff my face with a snack quick before he gets to my house.  

We are still talking while he is driving (him on speaker phone and me muting him so he can't hear me eating goldfish crackers), and he totally changes from the last 2 days of talking.  

\- He starts burping into the phone with no excuse me or anything. (Gross)

\- He asks if my house is set back from the road and I say yes and he's like great; I can pee off your deck in the morning. (my yard is not a toilet)

\- He asks if I am going to give him a lot of kisses when he arrives. (how about we meet first)

\- He was going to drive his truck but ended up driving his mom's car because he was having trouble with his truck before he wanted to leave.  (whatever)

\- I was on the deck and clapped my hands to get my dog to stop barking at a bird.  He heard it and asked if that was my ass clapping.  I said no I was just clapping to get the dogs attention.  He asked if I could clap my ass for him tonight.  Hell No!!

\- I asked him to grab some drinks for us, and he said he didn't need anything.  I told him I was not expecting company, and I only have coffee, milk and water.  He asked if I needed a drink to relax and I said yup.  He decided to get a 6 pack of hard ciders.  

He arrives and I meet him outside the house.  He goes in for a nice to meet you hug but grabs me and tried to kiss me on the lips.  I felt like a cat being squished by a toddlers bear hug.   I am squirming to get him out of my face.   He comes in and meets by dogs and opens a drink and has to make a big production to cheers the bottles. (The drink he really didn't want) We sit on the couch and chat for a bit and decide to watch a movie.  I let him pick the movie and he picks an action movie so it's fine.  As we are sitting silently watching he decides he wants to cuddle and puts his head on me and his hand on my leg and starts to try to hold my hand.  I am pulling away because I'm not comfortable with it.  

I am getting really hungry because the handful of crackers was not lunch/dinner.  I say I am hungry and he quickly says so is he.  I suggest going to the little corner deli and get some pizza slices or I could make a freezer pizza.  He quickly replies, you can make a pizza.  While I am in the kitchen heating up the oven he comes up to me again and bear hugs me and tries to kiss me on the lips again.  I get pulled away and say he needs to cool it down.  I get the thin crust pizza cooked and I take 2 slices, and he puts the rest of the pizza on his plate.  

We are back on the couch watching the movie and my bigger dog must have known I was not comfortable because she is now on the couch between me and the guy and stays put.  My dog is normally happy on her bed and not sitting on the couch leaning against me. 

The movie ends and he says he's so comfy and he could sleep here.   He has not noticed that I don't want to make out with him, hold his hand, cuddle, there are no sparks.  I have to say it's a good time to go.  He asks if I would like to see him again and I just politely say sure.  I have no intentions of seeing him again but wanted him out of my house. There were several other things that I did not like but just my preference not a huge red flag. 

How do I tell my friend about this hot mess of a ""date"" and that I am not interested in seeing her friend again?

1p4rss9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p4rss9/aitah_for_wanting_my_partner_to_get_rid_of_her/,AITAH for wanting my partner to get rid of her heart dog because I'm afraid of him?,"This year my long distance partner (30F) and I (26F) made the decision to move in together. We've been together roughly five years, the distance gapped by month long visitations back and forth. During the entire time we planned and discussed heavily eventual living arrangements; she resided within her parents home still and I, had a place with my disabled mother whom I'm caregiver towards. 

While we were discussing plans, one of the things was that we each had pets. I have six cats (all 9yrs+ seniors; I'm a foster failure) and a cocker spaniel (partially paralyzed with IVDD and disabled; also a senior) and she had a single cat (under 5) and a young ""mutt"" dog as she described. There was concern on integrating our combined households, since hers were single pet pets and mine a established multipet household.

 Now, she had said some things amid discussions that did spark interest. For instance, that her Kiba had a tendency to be a ""velcro"" dog and had bad separation anxiety. I've raised dogs all my life and have dealt with separation anxiety before, so I felt confident it would be a non-issue. But some things did raise a brow from me that I did not comment on, such as that her parents did not like to ""handle"" Kiba, or that she herself could not trim his nails without him snapping or even walk him herself or that he had to be kenneled when she was at work, or that he had toy and food aggression and tended to destroy all his toys. She wanted us that we cannot take a toy or treat from him when he has it, or he will snap at us.

I had food aggressive dogs and it seemed like something manageable so, I ignored my feelings.

  
Come March 2025 and she moves in and... Kiba is larger than I anticipated. He seems to be a GSD mix. It caught me off guard, I'd expected a medium sized dog over a large breed. He is 5-6years old and much more high strung then I'd figured, too. Still, I put aside my feelings and tried to bond. I confess I had struggles there... his eyes unnerved me, he did not listen when I asked him to stop and he chews bruises on my arms. She insists he sleeps on the bed with us and he takes up a majority of the space, often gets groany/growly when I try to move him over, or snips when my cats approach. 

**Incident One**

That first week he stayed here, we left him kenneled in our bedroom whilst we were out shopping and come back to find he has torn the door off our bedroom, as well as the carpet beside it. The door was ruined, split in half and he destroyed his kennel to escape it prior to the door itself, and the shelving beside the door was ruined. It upset me because it cost 350$ for a new door (I made her pay for), he ruined many of my purses and shelvings and the carpet still is in dire shape due to his antis. My partner had a loss of one purse that she seemed to focus on and I comfort her over, however her parents are well off and immediately replaced it. The destruction... scared me, though. 

**Incident Two**

My partner tends to go out for vacations with her parents. They are considerably more well off than I am; I work two jobs, in restaurants and service industry, to get by and support my mom as well as partner, and she works part time in customer service. It started off with her being homesick but over the past year she's had 5 separate vacations, each over 7 days in duration. During her vacations, she sends Kiba off to a boarding center to be watched since my work schedule doesn't permit me time to oversee him, nor can my disabled mom watch him. The local boarding center informed us after his first stay that he tore the metal door up on their kennel during his time here, but he was okay and unharmed. I... kept thinking about my bedroom door and felt that unease again. 

But I held my tongue. 

When we boarded him a second time, they called us later to say that he had knocked over a picture and broken glass in the kennel area and upon pickup, the center told us that he is no longer welcome there after further destroying a door due to needing more supervision that can be given and being destructive. Which came as a surprise given they are paid a lot so it seems like they would want for the business. She found is kind of funny that he was ""kicked out"" of doggy camp and it got brushed aside, in the end she decided we would start boarding him with the nearby vet clinic regardless of the high cost.

**Incident Three**

This past three months my health has plummeted. I got sick in September from pneumonia and upon going in to the ER, they found cavitary lesions in my lungs that required a lengthier diagnostic process. I was hospitalized a month then, released then sent back to ERs and again, hospitalized in October and, recently, again in November. It's believed I've a extreme rare auto immune disease that causes inflammation in small blood vessels and is life threatening for the first 3-4 years. The treatment requires immunotherapies and infusion therapies but in order to begin they need to do open lung surgery. They did a lesser invasive operation to acquire samples of my lungs, and between this and my lungs themselves I am incredibly weak and cannot stand long, walk well, or generally exist without pain and lethargy. 

I was discharged from the hospital so I can spent Thanksgiving with my family, and go back in early December for the surgery. I am immunocompromised and on strict bed rest, no lifting over 10lbs and on a large amount of medication. 

This Wednesday night, when I got home, my mom went to pick up my partner from work and left me briefly all alone with Kiba. I have been alone with him before and it was never a problem before; physically I'm in good shape or was, prior to illness, and he tends to be inactive or stationary. However, tonight maybe the house was more high energy or something amiss... I was unpacking my bag from the hospital and a packaged bakery item fell out. I didn't notice when it had and settled on the couch to take a breather.

My beloved cat Daisy (12yrs) was so happy to see me home and vibrating with purrs. She is a lap kitty and always wants to cuddle with me, and has been my heart cat since i found her all those years ago. That night, when she went to climb into my lap Kiba (having seen the discarded bakery item) grabbed her by the throat and shook her twice, then threw her against the wooden coffee table.

 I struggled to get up, I'm weaker and feeble and I rushed with my entire strength, and still wasn't able to separate the two nor prevent the attack. She laid limp on the floor so I scooped her into my arms and laid her on the ottoman, checking for injuries. She was panting, tongue out, eyes wide. Her back legs twitched violently and when I shift her, her body moved in... unnatural ways that still horrify me. I called for help and my mom rushed back. By the time we got her to the emergency vet, it was too late and they said with the trauma she had experienced, there was little to be done to of saved her. 

She died in my arms on the way there.

\--

I am terrified of Kiba. Whenever I see him, I see my Daisy in his jaws and relive that night. I was home alone and have never felt as helpless before as I did that night. I feel like I failed Daisy, like I failed to protect my baby and ignored the signs and warnings and this incident is my fault for not listening to myself.

I feel unsafe around Kiba, and like I had been lied too and all my fears brushed aside and gaslight into thinking his behavioral problems lesser then they actually were. I do not trust him in vicinity to my other pets any longer and keep insisting we rotate our pets with him; crate him, allow the other pets out, then allow him out and the pets put away.

My partner's parents already have agreed and paid to send Kiba away for a $2,500 dog training camp that focuses on food aggression and behavioral issues. He will be sent away for two weeks while she's on another vacation, then she will have classes with him and should he have further issue, they provide lifelong free lessons following the course. 

I find myself upset that it took him killing my pet to get her family to decide to address his problems, when they've known they exist his entire life. I am afraid that even with training, since she physically is unable to handle him that still he will be a threat. That since I am not medically fragile, and my mom likewise disabled, neither of us will be able to handle Kiba should he sparked another incident. I'm scared of being at this house now, unable to leave with my being immunocompromised, with this dog who killed the cat I adored so much I wake each morning and still have long crying jags over. She allows him out of the crate and I flinch and have to restrain myself from reacting, the sight of him itself does, genuinely, terrify me. 

 He barks a lot and even in a impact kennel, his destructiveness has bent bars and he draws in anything in vicinity to tear up. My partner is looking into day care options for when she works, though she does closing shifts so will not be able to have him out of the house every time she is not present.

Kiba is to my partner what Daisy was to me, she considers him ""her baby"" and dotes and loves on him and I know it is hurting her, as well. But I don't know how to stop being afraid, or uneasy, by being around him. Especially not when I've open lung surgery upcoming and will be  even more physically dependent on others. She keeps him kenneled in the main living room and simply in vicinity by him gives me anxiety attacks. He keeps taking naps in the very spot he killed Daisy and it upsets me so greatly I get nauseated. 



My family says that when he is gone for two weeks it'll be easier and give me time to grieve, though, still I don't think that will lessen my fears of him. I cannot even look his way without seeing that night, or feeling fear. I don't know how to continue living in this situation, for the remainder of his life, and not be haunted by what he has done and what I now know he can do. I don't feel safe. He is larger then all the other pets in the household and now, it is clear I cannot stop him should he react again. My other cats are senior, the oldest 22yrs, and my cocker spaniel dog is disabled and even being submissive, he has snipped and growled at her before. I am refusing to allow him by my cats or dog, and do think this will be a permanent change given the ages of my other pets. I know this is a fresh wound and may heal in time, though so far each day the fear has only grown.

I want him out of my life, for good and... It makes me feel like a bad partner, a bad person that I don't care about the details, what happens to him, so long as I do not have to have him around me on a daily basis any longer.

I don't want to upset my partner but I don't know how to live like this.

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. The cuffing season has me wishing for emotional warmth.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect.

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone but I'm also a night owl.

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity. 
Someone who shows up. Someone I can be soft with, who wants to build something grounded and real, even if it’s imperfect. Maybe we find peace in each other’s chaos, or maybe we just help each other breathe a little easier in the process.

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. The cuffing season has me wishing for emotional warmth.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect.

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone but I'm also a night owl.

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity. 
Someone who shows up. Someone I can be soft with, who wants to build something grounded and real, even if it’s imperfect. Maybe we find peace in each other’s chaos, or maybe we just help each other breathe a little easier in the process.

I tried sleeping earlier, different alarm tones, apps that make you solve puzzles… nothing worked. I still woke up annoyed and immediately hit snooze. Then I started doing something tiny but weirdly effective. Every night I prepare one small thing that I know I’ll genuinely enjoy in the morning. Not something healthy or productive. Something that feels like a treat. A really good iced coffee ready in the fridge. My favorite playlist queued. A pastry waiting on the counter. Even a silly meme I saved just for morning me. Now when the alarm goes off, my first thought isn’t ugh another day but oh right I get that thing. It sounds childish but it completely changes the emotional tone of waking up. Instead of dragging myself out of bed, I’m moving toward something that makes me smile.

If mornings are brutal for you too, try giving future you a tiny gift every night. It’s surprisingly powerful how much one small positive anchor can shift your whole morning.

However, what is subtly left out is that this bare minimum is usually expected from the same 5%-10% of men that these women usually drool over, that's a very important context I feel that all these women conveniently leave out..

I had a colleague in a previous company who would do everything for this one girl who was of the same caste. I guess he hoped to marry her or something. He would drop her home, wait for her for lunch, sometimes even buy her chocolates and coffee randomly. He would always be her backup when she went on leaves and would also sometimes pay on her behalf during office outings. But the girl barely appreciated. Why? Because he wasn't attractive.

This isn't just about this man, I have seen a lot others as well. So there are actually a vast plethora of men who'll do the bare minimum, its just that women don't want the efforts from those men. They want it from the top 5% and when the top 5% doesn't reciprocate because they have infinite choices, these women whine and cry.

Yes, I know a lot of men also drool over a select few women but at least with men, they drool over a much broader set of 40%-50% of women, they at least give half the women population a chance. With women, it is barely beyond 5% that they actually want.

Edit - Damn, this post below up, I did not expect so many comments. Some folks are calling my friend a simp or assuming its me, well, I learnt in school itself that you can't be nice to a girl and ""do things for her"" to win her over, if anything it turns her off even more. In fact, I used to be mean to a girl I viewed in a platonic way and instead she fell for me. So I learnt my lesson already in school. With regard to my friend, he isn't a simp. He's 31 and comes from a small community, had no luck in arranged marriage market from 3 years, so made a last ditch attempt at this colleague because she was 28. Alas, it was of no use. But my friend just genuinely wanted a partner. He was nice only to this girl because of same caste and marriage hopes and not to others, some of whom were better than her.",96,1763916787.0,AskIndianMen,77,0.79,False

I’m not trying to fake being local, I just want to respect the culture, understand the social cues better, and avoid looking totally out of place from the moment I walk outside.

I’d really appreciate any advice on what men my age usually wear day to day. Not the tourist version, but the actual stuff local guys wear when they’re going to work, grabbing coffee, meeting friends, or just walking around. What kind of jeans, shoes, jackets, colors, that kind of thing. And on the flip side, what people almost never wear that would make me instantly noticeable.

I’m also curious about daily habits that people here might take for granted. For example, I know smoking is way more common in parts of the Balkans than where I’m from. If that’s true, what do people typically smoke? Are there certain cigarette brands that everyone uses? Do a lot of people hand-roll, and if they do, where do they normally keep the pouch, papers, and lighter? Do guys carry that in their pockets, or is it more common to keep it in a small cross-body bag or fanny pack?

Same with café culture. I’d like to know how people normally act when they’re out. How long do people usually sit? Do folks stay for hours, or is it more in-and-out? Are there little things you’re expected to do or not do when you’re at a café so you don’t come across as rude without meaning to?

Basically, I’m looking for the small, practical stuff people in the Balkans don’t even think about because it’s just part of daily life. Anything that can help me understand the rhythm of the region better and blend in a bit instead of looking like an obvious outsider.

**Panel 1 – The Battlefield: Ukraine’s Pioneering Use of Delivery Bots**





In the first set of cartoons (your mud-filled WWI-style field and the single bot dodging drones), the motif is a world where autonomous machines are built for survival.

These are Ukraine’s bots—small, rugged, tracked carriers moving ammunition, food, water, batteries, and even medical kits to soldiers who are:



* pinned down,
* operating in drone-saturated zones, or
* encircled by Russian troops.





Ukraine has become the world leader in turning these robots into lifelines, not gimmicks.

The battlefield panel reflects this:



* drones overhead,
* explosions in the distance,
* trench-like terrain,
* and the bot pressing forward anyway.





This visually encodes the fact that Ukraine is not merely using robots—they are tactically redefining logistics at the front in a modern war where exposed humans cannot safely carry supplies.



The visual tone is gritty, serious, and urgent:

robots in harm’s way because humans would die doing the same job.









**Panel 2 – The Seattle / LAX Civilian World: Trivial Uses of the Same Tech**





The second set of panels—the Starbucks bots traveling through traffic—forms a deliberate comedic contrast.



In the civilian West, the same general class of robotics ends up delivering:



* lattes,
* burritos,
* take-out orders.





The cartoon shows “hostile conditions” played for humor—traffic, angry drivers, bored pedestrians—but the stakes are trivial compared to the battlefield.



This juxtaposition reinforces a central idea:

the same category of autonomous mobility tech that keeps Ukrainian soldiers alive is used elsewhere to prevent someone from walking two blocks for coffee.



The contrast sharpens the arc:

||
||
|**Ukraine**|**U.S. (Seattle/LAX)**|
|Robots carry life-or-death supplies under drone fire|Robots deliver flavored lattes through morning traffic|
|Soldiers rely on bots because human runners would be killed|Commuters rely on bots because traffic is annoying|
|Tactical necessity|Consumer convenience|
|Innovation under existential pressure|Innovation under comfort|









**Narrative Synthesis**





The arc reads as:



1. Ukraine = the battlefield application where delivery bots matter for survival. They keep encircled units supplied, maintain momentum under fire, and represent an adaptive warfare style unmatched anywhere else.
2. The West = the civilian commercialization of the same tech. The bots are cute, friendly, delivering luxury goods.
3. The Cartoon’s Comedic Punchline: Two worlds using the same technology for utterly different purposes. One world uses it to “deliver hope.” The other uses it to “deliver coffee.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1p4ret0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p4ret0/slight_warning_on_buying_from_burman_coffee/,Slight warning on buying from Burman Coffee Traders,"I generally like Burman Coffee Traders.  I've bought two roasters from them and in just 2024 and 2025, I've spent over $1000 on green coffee beans from them. (The vast majority is decaf, and I drink >90% of the coffee made from those beans.)

I'm writing a quick warning because of a series of disappointments with Burman over their current crop of Decaffeinated Brazil Mogiana 15/16 – Royal Select SWP.

I normally love a good Brazil decaf, and I placed four separate orders with decaf Brazil from Burman in 2004, including both their Decaffeinated Brazil Mogiana - Royal Select MWP and the Decaffeinated Brazil Mogiana 15/16 - Royal Select SWP.  I absolutely loved those decaf Brazilian orders.

I know coffees change from year to year and even lot to lot, but the current lot of Decaffeinated Brazil Mogiana 15/16 – Royal Select SWP is the single most disappointing green coffee bean purchase I've made.

This tastes radically different to me than the other decaf Brazil orders I've made, every single cup has a bad astringent taste.  I've tried roasting it several times, aiming for medium, medium-dark and dark roast over the past month hoping it was user error on my side, but over the last few batches, it doesn't matter if I wait 3 days or 21, it doesn't matter if I try espresso, pour over or French press, I cannot make a cup of coffee with this that is better than bad.

The beans do not crack as clearly as other decafs.

I reached out to Burman and their response said:

>Bad taste, no cracking, are you pretty sure you are getting them roasted dark enough? The surface color of decaf can be a bit tricky and Brazil decafs are generally not light roast coffees. Most beans taste pretty bad if too lightly roasted.  Brazil beans cracking a bit softer than most is a bit normal, depending on the lot but many Brazilians are softer beans comparatively to many other Central/South American coffees. 

I replied that I am roasting well into the second crack, and med, med-dark and dark have all been straight up bad.  I've gone through over half a dozen roasts trying to figure out how to make these acceptable, and only an Italian Roast, where everything starts to taste pretty similar, gets rid of the off taste of these beans.

Burman never replied to that e-mail, so I decided to write two reviews.  I wrote a five-star review for their Decaffeinated Colombian Royal Select MWP and a one-star review for the Brazil decaf.

Burman posted my five-star review and never posted my one-star review in addition to not replying to my follow up e-mail to them with additional information about why I felt the beans were problematically bad and that I had already tried medium, medium-dark and dark roasts prior to reaching out.

Honestly, I thought they were going to test the Brazil decaf and confirm something had contaminated it, either in storage or in the MWP process.  I thought for sure other customers would have said something because it's so much worse than past Brazil decafs I've gotten from them.

It's not a huge deal that they asked me to give them more information and then stopped replying to me after I did, but between that and the moderation of posting good reviews but not posting bad reviews, I've been left with a bad taste in my mouth.

It's a shame, as I'm the guy walking around in my Burman shirt on the weekend and trying to get other people into roasting.

Burman used to have a more robust assortment of SWP and MWP options, and up until recently I had no complaints...but now I'm curious if there's any place else in the US people would recommend for multiple SWP, MWP or CO2 decaf green beans.  Any recommendations?  I'm not opposed to continuing to buy from Burman, but I'm happy to evaluate my options for my next order.",1,1763916354.0,espresso,3,0.57,False
1p4regn,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinancecanada/comments/1p4regn/i_want_to_work_everyday_for_a_minimum_of_4_hours/,"I want to work everyday for a minimum of 4 hours. If I did, I wouldn't have suffered like how I did for over 6 years.","I'm allowed to work 20 hours a week while living off ODSP and when I did have a job back in my early twenties I was working often 12-20 hours a week. 

So instead of Monday Friday 9:00 to 5:00 it would be Monday Friday but 11:00 to 3:00, but it doesn't have to be those particular hours that would just be most ideal for me. 

I am absolutely capable of working 8 hours a day, contrary to many people's opinions that objectively think I ""can't"". 

Yes I COULD, I can work an 8-hour shift if I really had to but that would mean I can't live off ODSP and that would be the far better quality of life. 

Also I should mention that the substance abuse habits are probably the least of it. I also have several expensive subscriptions, like Netflix, Paramount Plus, Patreon, YouTube, Google One, and there's also the annual Sportsnet subscription, which is about $370 annually so I'm over a dollar a day. 

Fast food is one of the examples of spending habits that becomes an issue only when I have the money, but when I don't have the money I'll just eat cheap and frugal grocery items until I can next get paid. Also energy drinks, like fast food I will get a lot of it when I have the money but when I don't have the money I never drink energy drinks and I'll just drink simple coffee and eat whole and frugal foods like eggs, bread, cheese, onions, potatoes, rice and beans or things like that. 

Some people are under the false impression, that all I want to do, is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana all day, everyday, and that's the furthest from the truth. 

I would like to smoke or drink AFTER all my responsibilities for the day are taken care of, which most people don't have an issue with and I didn't when I worked, but post covid and all the unemployment bullshit that went along with it, my life never got better but got a thousand times worse. 

Also when I smoked before work, it was usually several hours and I show up early and get some food before my shift starts. I'd smoke at 9, arrive at 10/eat before my shift and start at 11. 

During my shifts, I have plenty of coffee to keep me going, after my shifts, what I would look forward to the most is a beer at the bar, because it's still several hours before I have to make the commute back home, or if I stop at a friend's house after work but this lifestyle of mine ended in 2019 and I miss it more than anything. 

I struggled with really serious suicidal thoughts following my unemployment in 2019, and unfortunately they only got worse the longer I was unemployed, because there is absolutely no way I want to spend the rest of my life living off ODSP like how I do, on top of also giving people money, like the people that were taking advantage of me and that just puts me in the hole further. 

I had somebody lend me a gram worth of bunk weed and they wanted $40 for it and I had to give them 20, and they still want the other 20 next Friday and it wouldn't be paid until the Monday, it's bullshit because I blocked him from his Facebook and he just harassed me from his mom's Facebook and there was nothing I could do but give him the money so that we he'd bug off.

1p4re4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LonghornNation/comments/1p4re4s/tailgate_smoked_salmon_salad/,Tailgate Smoked Salmon Salad,"It was a very welcome 'touch grass' day outside SanJac garage for the tailgate yesterday.  I'm really glad I saw y'all this season.  Here's the prep for that smoked salmon salad.  I think if you make this at home, chances are you'll never buy store-bought smoked salmon again. This is a 'family get-together' staple for us; a T-day or Christmas staple along with pimento cheese and jalapeno-citrus jelly.   How to do this fish:  
&nbsp;  
Costco or Sam's for a side of 'Atlantic' (farm-grown) salmon.  Check the fine print for the country of origin: you want Norway, not Chile.  Norway salmon has a higher fat content and tastes far 'butterier'.  
&nbsp;  
Rainbow Trout works well for this too.  Other types of salmon don't do so well: sockeye wild-caught isn't nearly as good as King.  
&nbsp;  
Make a rub.  I use:  
1 tsp black pepper corns  
1 tsp granulated garlic  
1 tbs kosher salt  
2 tbs brown sugars (I typically mix a few and use coconut and muscavado in the mix)  
1/2 tsp dill  
&nbsp;  
I use a 'whirly blade' coffee/spice grinder to make a fine powder out of the rub.  Mine's a Black & Decker, but you can find many inexpensive examples at HEB or Amazon.  
&nbsp;  
Rub both sides of the fish (I typically cut it in half) and lay to rest in an aluminum foil half-pan. I'll drizzle the fish with honey at this stage (lightly! use about 1/2 tbs on one side of the fish. The effect on flavor is dramatic).   Let the salt/sugar 'melt' into the fish (I leave it overnight in the fridge, covered in saran).  This stage is key: you want the juices to really color the thin edges of the fish, that's when you know the salt has permeated the whole fillet and carried the spice and sugar in.  
&nbsp;  
Spray cooking spray/oil on wire rack(s) big enough to cover the half pan, and lift the fillets onto the grate, letting the drip collect again in the half-pan. Leave it uncovered on the counter for a few hours (after the salt/sugar has worked in, no bacteria can survive, so it's food-safe) or the fridge overnight again.  You're trying to make a 'pellicule' (a dried skin on the fish) to gather the smoke.  
&nbsp;  
I put the fish, perched on the racks above the half-pan (you see what I did there?) into the cabinet smoker.  If you don't have a cabinet smoker, you can use a cheap round kettle grill (the actual wire grille part) and two large terra-cotta planters stacked wide-end to wide-end, you'll figure this part out).  I use a 12""x1-3/4"" stainless 'perforated metal cold-smoking tube'. If you use a Weber style kettle grill, you can use a similar 'snake' cold-smoke accessory.  Both types (tube and snake) are easily found on Amazon.    
&nbsp;  
Remember, you're COLD smoking. Don't build a fire.  The snake or tube will raise the air in the chamber a degree or three at most.  
&nbsp;  
I get fruitwood and oak pellets from Wal-Mart or HEB.  Yesterday's fish was smoked with Apple, Cherry, Pecan, and an Oak-Maple mix (""Championship Mix"").  I use about 1/3 cup of each, for 1-1/3 cup total pellets (will smoke for 1 hr). Using a propane torch with a metal straw I light it: about 3 minutes blowing the burning gas into the pellets from an angle into the lowest portion of the tube until flame billows out of the pellets for a few seconds after taking the torch off; I leave the tube propped at a tall angle against the side of the smoker so the pellets 'fall' into the hot ash/burning section.  If using a 'snake' type, it'll burn around the ring to the center.   
&nbsp;  
After about an hour or so, the pellets will burn out; I take the whole rack and half-pan assembly and pop it in the oven top rack, and put a foil-lined cookie sheet under it to catch drips from the overhang.  My oven will hold 185'F, if yours doesn't, you'll need to set it higher and periodically open the door.  I give the fish about 1 hour.  While you've got it in the oven, keep an eye out for white 'albumin' forming (proteins from the 'juice'). It it starts, open the door and cool the fish.  Typically, I take it out at about 145' with an instant-read.   
&nbsp;     
Let it cool about 20 min.  Now, drop it into a larger food storage container, and refrigerate overnight - all the flavors and the smoke will mellow and you will greatly appreciate the melding the rest gives it.   
&nbsp;  
When it's time to mix it into salmon salad, I add mayonnaise to taste/consistency, and I sprinkle in dried diced onion flake-lets.  They'll absorb the oil and moisture from both the salmon and the mayo; in about 12 more hours, it's ready to be food bliss.

The dimensions are 5.17m x 4.14m so it's massive compared to previous places I've lived in. It's nearly a rectangle except for a little protrusion next to the patio doors with a window there. I'm not sure how best to use all this space well. Here's a picture of what's in it now.

https://imgup.uk/v/mHPYKtnZ

I'm happy to sell the couch and the two Billy bookcases that you see. I really like the TV stand (180cm long) so I want to keep it. The big issue at the moment is that the couch-to-TV distance is 4.14m with the current setup and I don't really want to buy a huge TV because they are quite expensive. I'm happy with something in the 55in to 65in range and a good rule of thumb is for the couch to be around 2m away. What's a good way to fix this issue and what can I do with the rest of the space?
 
My current plan is:  
1. Buy a non-L-shaped couch and move it forward. Add a coffee table and maybe a rug to make a nice TV space. Open up a path behind the couch to walk to the patio doors and maybe put a sideboard there?  
2. Put a dining table and chairs to the left as soon as you enter the room   
3. Have one of the bookcases and an armchair and make a reading corner with that space near the window.  
  

Questions:  
1. Is moving the couch away from the wall and leaving a path to the patio doors a good idea?  
2. What do I do with the space to the right of the doorway, as soon as I enter. Leave it empty?  

I'm open to more ideas on how to make the space look more cohesive and have a decent TV and couch setup. I don't mind buying some more furniture but generally, I'm looking to keep that minimal and buy used items since this is a rental and I will have to sell it all when I leave.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p4rb3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anglicanism/comments/1p4rb3v/went_to_an_anglican_church_for_the_first_time_and/,Went to an Anglican church for the first time and it was a great experience,"First of all, I don't think I'm actually Christian (I'm dealing with doubts about faith), I just feel draw to it, and all the history and tradition brings me such a peace of mind. The ideals and beliefs that Christianity stands for are beautiful, it genuinely makes me emotional. Because of that, I had been going to Mass at a Catholic church every Sunday out of interest. I would just sit at the last row and hope no one talked to me. Later I found out there was a Anglican church near me and got curious to attend an Anglican Mass in person. 

When I got there, the difference between the two was... interesting. It was not actually a church, but more of a chapel (meaning it was really small) beautifully designed with vivid red bricks and a humble wood altar. There weren't many people like in the Catholic masses I attended, I counted only 8 including me, mostly old men. Everyone politely presented themselves to me, no one asked intrusive questions like ""Why did you come?"" ""What do you pray for?"" ""What do you believe?"" or things like that, they were just happy I was there and wanted to know my name or what I was studying in college.

One of them sat next to me and patiently started to explain the rituals and how everything worked. He handed me a copy of the Book of Common Prayer and instructed me what pages we would be using today. He said anyone was welcome to participate at the Eucharist and invited me to, I said I didn't want to for now (it felt disrespectful for me to join, since I don't even know if I believe it or not, I also stayed seated during the Catholic Masses).

During the Mass, I was afraid that I would get lost at the almost thousand pages prayer book. Thankfully the priest always mentioned the page before praying, it was easy to follow. 

At the end, when I was about to leave, one of the churchgoers told me that after every mass, it was a local tradition to gather everyone at the back garden to drink some coffee and chat. I just listened to them talk about life and other things, it felt good to be part of that.

Moments later, it was starting to rain and everyone said their goodbyes, getting out in a hurry. I was planning to walk to the bus stop but the priest and his wife offered me a ride home, and, obviously, that was a much better option.

I feel very happy to have attended this church. I've read some bad things about Protestant churches and how they try to entangle people's lives to the church (Sorry... I know this is silly prejudice), but not once anyone asked me if I was going to come back next Sunday or tried to convince me, although I feel very inclined to.

Los niños y niñas más jóvenes de El Salvador tienen la dicha de ser la generación que nació con internet. Teléfonos, computadoras, tablets y laptops a su disposición para navegar el gran y vasto mundillo de la red, pero, como en todo buen país tercermundista, la mayoría de estos jóvenes no tienen regulación. Pueden encontrarse con contenido perturbador, pornográfico y violento sin intención de buscarlo. Los padres usan los teléfonos para que deje de chillar el nene porque es la solución más fácil y rápida, pero no se percatan del daño (físico y psicológico) que provocan.

Llevo alrededor de cinco años analizando en mis alredores el tipo de contenido que un niño puede ver en internet. Al principio se trataban de recopilaciones de sus caricaturas favoritas, luego pasaron a ser animaciones baratas con efectos sobreestimulantes (conocido como r/ElsaGate) y hoy en día es puro contenido generado por IA (conocido como r/brainrot).

Si bien es cierto existe el argumento de que hace años cuando éramos jóvenes veíamos y presenciábamos cosas por internet de igual o peor magnitud, se sabe que el contenido actual  [afecta cognitivamente](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2026-89350-001.pdf) al usuario por su formato corto y rápido en plataformas como Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook y Youtube.

Así que yo les pregunto:

¿Qué opinan del brainrot? ¿Conocían lo que es este contenido?

¿Creen que los niños son más adictos a internet que nosotros en el pasado?

¿De qué manera regularían el uso del internet a un niño?

¿Se han topado casos referentes al tema?

Y por último, como aclaración: >!sé que no son solo los niños los que se ven afectados por contenido generado por IA. Soy consciente de la enorme cantidad de gente que es presa fácil a la desinformación. Por ello decidí enfocar el tema usando al grupo juvenil como el único afectado.!<

Honestly… these things are ridiculous in the best way.

First off—the size. “Big Ass” is not exaggeration. This thing is basically a piece of furniture. I put it on my coffee table and it instantly made the whole room feel like a fancy hotel lobby.

Scent: I got the Santal Ember and Cedar Smoke. They’re way richer and more layered than normal candles. Not that cheap perfumey smell—more like a boutique fragrance room diffuser. My whole living room smells good even when it's not lit, which kind of shocked me.

Aesthetic: The heavy glass jar looks insane in person. Feels like something you'd see in a luxury hotel or a designer’s house. It’s heavy enough to double as a blunt weapon if someone breaks in lol.

Downside: Yeah, they’re pricey. More of a “treat yourself” or gift-type item. But the size + scent strength + how slow it burns actually made it feel like a better value than my usual $40 candles.

Overall: If you’re into home scents or just want your place to feel like a high-end Airbnb, they’re 100% worth trying. Not an everyday candle, but absolutely a statement piece.

Title: Do I kill myself or have another cup of coffee? 

Do I want to kill myself or have another cup of coffee?

I was sure we’d talked about this…that there’s a reason I never run out of coffee. 

I made sure you knew to just go to bed, if you didn’t want caffeine. 

& when all else failed, no matter what, that no matter how bad the problem, just go to bed. 

I never said it would be better when you woke up, but I could and did guarantee that it would be different. HOW did you miss this lesson? How did I NOT make it a priority that you knew if nothing else you KNEW THIS...just go to sleep.

I KNOW we talked about the fact that NO good, helpful or smart decisions are ever made past midnight. I’m certain of it. 

But for some reason, you didn’t implement this advice. 

You chose to do something differently. You decided to do your thing. You decided to die.

I always told you to be safe and have fun. 

When the police told me that you were gone, I was hoping you were having fun and weren’t being safe.  I almost wish that was the case, because that feels like it makes more sense. Like I can forgive you for that kind of mistake.  

But suicide. I understand suicide. Of course I do. I know how easy it is to live there. On the verge of not having any energy left to endure the constant agony and pain of living.

The stressors, the ache, the pain. The overwhelming disparity of it all, I’ve lived there…and I’m sorry I introduced you to that existence. It was not my intention. You were always paying close attention, and you paid for my mistakes. 

We baked together, since you could stand on a stool next to the counter, and I ensured you knew what size measuring cup you were holding in your chubby little fingers as you dumped most of the flour in the bowl. 

Those same fingers had sent me a text asking to play cards with you the next day, the same day I learned those same fingers chose their own death. 

How can I not blame myself when I taught you to stand up for your own beliefs, that includes your right to choose – choose when there really is a choice. 

When you let me know you were Transgendered, I offered you body autonomy, but this was not what I had in mind! 

But you certainly have the right – had – the right. 

I learned early on in parenting you that as your mother there was only the illusion of controlling you. 

I never could get your squirmy little legs into tights, and I realized I hated them as much as you and they were just torture devices anyway. The cotton, white and pink elastic squeezing material were all purchased by your Nana, who loved to dress you in frilly pink dresses and an assortment of pretty outfits. I hated them, as did you. So, you never had to wear them at my house, I threw them all out…but they existed in your other world, at your dad’s house. 

Gratefully – but still I sit here almost a year since you made the choice – and I can’ t help but feel responsible – as your mother – for not keeping you from having to wear them at all. 

I didn’t  provide you with the sufficient tools to survive in this cruel world. I sent you out into this world without the proper armour. Fuck, that’s failing as a mother. 

I tried, I truly did…and I failed. 

And now I’m here, not liking the world anymore then I did before you left. 

I was ready and willing to end my life before you left, I wanted to be the one who died by suicide – but you did it. There’s courage in that. You reached your limit, and there is a lot I could have done, and didn’t do, and I will have to live with that for the rest of my life. 

Perhaps you didn’t want to bother me. 

Maybe you were worried about worrying me. 

Possibly you thought asking for help would be too much for me to handle. 

Instead, you thought I’d be able to handle your death better? 

Rational…I guess…in that moment…it made sense to you. I love you. I miss you. & I’m sorry that I was not a good enough mother to keep you here.  The world is better because you existed, thank you for being here as long as you could.

An LSD + Thc trip report / 600ug +1000mg

What a journey… 

Preface + Context (Skip if wanted)

I’m a decently experienced psychonaut. Done most entheogens except for dmt. Personally i enjoy trips over the span of a period of time, in which i attempt to dive deeper and deeper into the confines of the psyche. I’m Christian, so personally i do not enter these states from a perspective of worship, but rather discernment. I do not doubt the stories of complex god like creatures but i like to see them more as fallen angels or angels. 

  
before i say anything else, i'd like to say, please be careful and i do not endorse these kind of doses. I have been using entheogens for around 10 years. Especially mixing two strong compounds.

That said.

This journey begins around 11 months after my last flight… 

There’s always a reason for me being back here it seems. My previous undertaking had been psilocybin. I discovered how easy it was to nurture a grow kit, so i went all in on them. Mckennai, B+, Panaelous cyanescens, Albino J Frost. 

To be quite frank i had reached a high level of completion and satisfaction with my journey through these mushrooms. Got to the point where i managed to consume a magnum opus dose of 7.5g Albino J frost (dry) 1G of Pan Cyan dry and 5g of pan Cyan fresh. This + Some experience with salvia took me so far that i thought i wouldn’t need to come back to it. 

However….

I recently started to deal with some serious family issues that can not be conventionally resolved. Therefore i wanted to venture inward to address my mentality towards them and see ways to  cope with it, ways to heal. I won’t go into detail, but i felt like if i had fallen back into the pits of my teenage depression. Something i thought i had already outgrown. Seems i was wrong. Maybe there was wounds left to heal.  
  


I have gone through very different phases of functionality, right now i was coming from the top of the world. Great job, my own apartment, my faith unshaken. Yet slowly this would all crumble before me.  
  
 The culmination of the mushroom trips led me to leave my apartment to go and live with my grandparents who had started to become too old to take care of themselves. I quit my job abroad, earning 5k a month at 24. There was work abuse but also i didn’t want to leave my grandparents behind. Saddest of all, my faith had crumbled before me. Like if i had tainted it with my pride, yet it remained attached to me through hope. I knew that though i had climbed back down the ladder of life, this would allow me to nurture the tree of life i was growing. 

That’s why i came back to LSD

LSD is a substance close to my heart and familiar. Tried it for the first time at 16. 

I wish i had done so with a bit more maturity… LSD is beautiful, but it is powerful and it had taken me deep. I have always searched for high doses, but at a young age i did so recklessly and thus, i was crushed over and over. Trips of 5 and 6 tabs had taken me to such deep deep water. Feelings of waking up elsewhere, being experimented on by aliens, mind you while on video call with my ex girl friend, who is very scared for me, long story short, she called my parents and they called the police on me while i was on 5 tabs. So please approach this gradually and carefully.

Recently i had opened the gates again. Feeling drowned by the pressure of my current situation. I consumed 500mg of thc from some homemade hash butter and brewed a 5g mushroom tea, from my own mushrooms, matter of fact, the last little frozen packet i had around 11 months later, but no mold or funky smell so, good to go.

Wow… Just… WOW! What an absolutely serene state. I was finally able to cry. I held my cat and cried and cried to our memories of the past. Months of pent up stress flowing out of me through my tears.  
  
 It was time to begin a new journey. I had things to heal, find and learn. 

Our  main acid guy was back in town. This guy always delivered. Tested his stuff 5 times with no issues. Felt almost like things clicked together. I contacted him and we met up. Gave him 80 bucks and he gave me like 14 double drop tabs. He was supposed to give me 8. Just a wild character of a guy, very interesting trips of his own. 

That same day i had to dip my feet in the ether. Get to know LSD once more. So it was…

I took two tabs at 23:00 and my journey began about 2 hours later.  I put on some cowboy bebop as i usually do when i trip, waiting for the effects to build up and once i reached my peak, i stopped the show and put some ambient music. Spent hours swimming deep and deep. I felt weightless. My spine was decompressing, my muscles, which had been tied up due to stress, finally relented. I Could feel my energy spread to every corner of my mind and my body.  
  
 Usually in the past, LSD made me think fast, quick weird thoughts, things that would disturb the peace. This had caused issues in the past. The ego flailing around in an attempt to gain control. However i had integrated so much info from my last trips. I finally saw my mistake. I must let it all happen, without giving myself to the negativity the ego stirred up. So i did.  
  
 The fast and random thoughts came to a halt as i realised that they were of my own doing. If i simply sat and stayed quiet, i could navigate within. 

So begins the story of this new trip. Yet not the end of this expedition. 

See Ya Space Cows

  
  
  


**Trip Report**

**Time: 22:30**  

**Goal: Start a new chapter in life. Allow new things to flourish. Use LSD as medicine.**

It was a cold saturday night. I had not done much that day, so as to enter the experience with full concentration and a clear mind. Had some steak 11h before the trip and a protein shake 3h before. 

The Jump

Once everyone had receded into their lair, it was time to prepare the ship. I brewed myself a coffee with homemade THC infused coconut butter, a total of 500mg to up to 800mg thc. (Had same dose that morning too) I give this range, because i made this coconut butter with 88g of dry sift. So depending on it’s purity, which i have not tested, could be between the numbers stated.

As for the acid.

I quietly walked to the fridge and grabbed a small baggy filled with 12 tabs. Made my way to my room and separated a strip of 3 purple tabs, there was a design but it couldn’t be discerned. 200ug per little square.

I was quite intimidated. This was by no means even close to my highest dose, but it had been so long… I knew i was going to take the jump. Perhaps hesitation builds up over time. But i always keep in mind the fact that i have to dive. Synonymous to the cliffs by the ocean back home.

I knew that feeling of standing at the top of the cliff and hesitating. 17 meters or  55 feet is the highest i jumped, not crazy, but enough to leave an imprint. The rush of adrenaline as you look down, knowing that once you step over, there will be no turning back and if you do not stay calm and land at the precise moment, there will be issues.  

I bring this memory up often. A temporary , a surrender that that lands you into the cold water. A familiar yet unusual world. Where you can only stay for a breath. When you come back up, you just look at the cliff. It’s a prayer fulfilled.  
  


Time to Trip

Speaking about prayers, it was time for mine now. I did so, asked for forgiveness, then put the strip of 3 tabs under my tongue, set a timer for 1h  and sat at my desk. Pen and notebook in hand, paired with some ambient space themed music.

T + 1H  

Woah, this kicked in fast… I thought to myself as i drew myself into a spaceship. I turned off all lights except for a small reading one. It’s hue a fuzzy orange. Visuals Started to fill my peripheral vision. warm and viscous visuals. Small lines blending into each other, slowly forming a lens like focus into my book and drawing. 

I’m not really good at drawing so i just tried to do a glorified doodle, but it was still interesting. I made the markings for 00:42 am then 02:56 am and finally 05:04am. I may attach the drawings but don’t expect any picasso work. 

The music was slow and felt like it vibrated, there was a heavy feeling of melancholy and nostalgia. Feelings that are really close to me and i relate to a lot. 

The heaviness slowly drifted me from my chair,  into my bed, alongside my trusty trip companion: My cat. Seems like he totally changes his behavior when i use entheogens, as i settled in bed, he twisted and contorted, purring heavily. Scratching and kneading my hoodie. 

We are super close so we stayed together basically all night. 

I set a timer for an hour again and receded into my bed, laying down flat on my back with no pillow, my neck and spine totally free. I train very often so my back gest super tight.

 Now… I’m weightless. 

Eyes open but focused on the same world as when they are closed. Beginning to think to myself, what will i learn from this, what will i heal? 

Soon enough that timer i set started to ring. It was almost time for the peak. Time to draw and document some of it on my notebook before full flight. 

T+ 2H

As i’m drawing. I realize the world looks so much like fear and loathing in las vegas. Hard to describe, like if that orange fuzzy light had puffed up  reality itself. It felt like i was seeing through bubbles. Anywhere that orange light was, there was fuzz and a rugged visual, with a  grainy and sand like texture across the field of view. Felt a bit like reality on steroids. Funnily enough i am currently using steroids. 

Extrapolating my state of mind from the drawing i made at this time. Abstraction began to increase. Less material, yet it filled my page with drawings. Simple thin lines, but structures of large orders of magnitude. I drew a fish, kind of how i felt at the time. But it wasn’t drawing knowing what i was going to draw, it’s more like i let the drawings appear visually.

I was able to breathe so deeply, so profoundly. It was a privilege, i gasped for air slowly but surely, repeatedly. Feeling every corner of my body release tension as my musculature softened into a state of trance and unclogged bloodflow.

As i was drawing, i started to see the silhouettes of women within already drawn things, so i followed what i saw and drew the delicate and ebbing figure of this woman. It was still very abstract, almost resembling a venus statue. Incomplete fully, but containing the basics tenets of what a female body is. 

I couldn’t help but notice however, wasn’t i supposed to learn something from all of this??

Then it hit me. I drew on my piece of paper. Feels like being a kid again. That’s when it dawned on me. I was back here because life around me was taking my inner child away from me. Something i’m no stranger to. I realised that so many of the behaviors i live around are tied to this. Reclaiming my innocence. My family, for as much good as they have done. Have also caused more damage to me than anyone. Through them i have lived situations that i would not wish on anyone.

This depressed me and right now, i felt the same depression as i did in that old time. It is so humbling to return to living with a broken family after you’ve been alone for years. Yet now i didn’t feel hopeless. The depression did not hurt in the same way. But even still, i wanted to feel like a kid again. I wanted to feel like i could trust people, like i could play freely, without judgement. 

So this is why everything is moving so slow, 

why this doesn’t feel like a eureka moment. 

This isn’t meant to be that. Simply lie down and let yourself heal. So i did.

The music, so mesmerizing. I could let myself drift into it. Not a thought in my head. 

T+ 4h

I’m so hungry. 

I needed some food to build myself back into the trip. Time for a space walk i thought. I opened my door and no surprise. It felt like i was in space. I could wander but i could not stay hung up on something. If anyone finds me right now, i’m tripping balls.

I grabbed a whole cut pineapple from the fridge, doused in nectar and cold. 

This is gonna be good…

Space walk complete, i’m back in my room. With the mythical space item: Juicy, Sweet, indulgent, silky and viscous pineapple + it’s nectar. I put my headphones back on and slowly devoured the pineapple. 500g of it. Akin to a cat eating it’s capture. I was hunched over the bowl containing the pineapple, slowly tearing it’s flesh, bite after bite.  
  
 Fruit on psychedelics has to be one of the most pleasant experiences. 

With some new fuel,  it was time to fly back  home. The journey back was a pure, unadulterated bliss. Innocent and yet not fearing of the possibility that this state may crumble. Because i did not fear having to defend myself? I mean this in a protective way.

 There was very little thought after that. I merged with my bed still weightless, the music felt like water, like i was drifting, but then i became the stream itself. I became totally still, surrounded by pillows and my purring cat. This water of sort was flowing through me, or i was part of it, im not sure.

\+

T+ 7h

I made my way to the bathroom and my cat finally was done with me, so he left to go sleep with his Cat  brother.

 A drift of cold air had caught me and i realised, i want some cold. So when i got back to my room. I got naked and turned a large fan on. It was already cold since it’s november, but i wanted to feel really cold. Not to the point of getting sick. Simply as much as i could take. This was the landing. I left the liquid ether like ocean for a more grounded  base in this icy retreat. My visuals of small rays of light entering through my blinds had morphed from liquid like flowing structures, to cold, sharp and contained visuals. But i felt so relieved, i felt well, but i still have a bit more to heal from this compound. I will wait 1 week and come back with a slightly higher dose

It’s time to go to sleep. 

See you Space cowboy :)

No shade, but here's the thing: most people aren’t looking for vibes, they need *function*.

What’s wild is, so many smart, motivated people still wake up feeling scattered, groggy, or already behind. This is super common, even among founders, creatives, students, you name it. The reason isn't laziness. It's because most morning routines aren't designed based on actual cognitive science or habit research. They’re copy-pasted from influencers who are chasing aesthetics, not results.

This post is a breakdown of what actually works, based on top-tier books, podcasts, and scientific research. No fluff, no 5 AM hustle bro vibes. Just real tools that build physical and mental *armor* for your day.

---

* **Start with a “reset ritual”, before you check your phone**
    * James Clear, author of *Atomic Habits*, explains that small triggers shape our identity over time. So the act of reaching for your phone first creates reactivity before your brain fully wakes up.
    * Instead, build a *reset ritual* that tells your brain “new day, new mindset.” Keep it stupid simple:
        * Light a candle or splash cold water on your face.
        * Six slow inhales and exhales.
        * Touch your feet to the floor and say something like “inputs before outputs.”
    * Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman suggests that *sunlight within the first 30 minutes* helps reset your circadian clock and boosts dopamine. That’s your real energy shot, not caffeine.

* **Move your body for 2 minutes minimum**
    * You don’t need a 45-minute HIIT session. Just *movement*. This shifts your physiology from sleep inertia into active mode.
    * Dr. Kelly McGonigal (Stanford, author of *The Joy of Movement*) explains that even light exercise increases dopamine and BDNF, which makes your brain sharper and mood better all day.
    * Try:
        * 30 jumping jacks
        * A 1-minute wall sit
        * Dancing to one song you actually like
        * Walk a lap around your block barefoot—bonus grounding effect

* **Prime your brain with “active recall” instead of passive input**
    * Most people scroll news or podcasts while making breakfast. Problem is, that's *passive*. It doesn’t engage memory or focus.
    * Active recall = asking your brain to *retrieve* info. This rewires your brain for learning and mental agility.
        * Try:
            * Writing 2 things you learned yesterday
            * Quizzing yourself on a book you’re reading
            * Repeating your main goals out loud
    * Research from *Nature Reviews Neuroscience* found that recall-based practices increase long-term memory and decision-making more than re-reading or passive learning.

* **Eat protein + fat, skip sugar + caffeine spike (at least right away)**
    * MIT’s Dr. Layne Norton teaches that high-protein breakfasts help regulate dopamine and insulin, which means better mood and fewer cravings later.
    * Try:
        * 2 boiled eggs + nut butter on toast
        * Full-fat Greek yogurt + berries
        * Or if you’re in a rush, a protein shake with creatine + omega-3
    * Avoid starting your day with just coffee and carbs. That combo spikes cortisol then crashes focus.

* **Use “implementation intentions” to lock in your next action**
    * This one’s gold from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer. Instead of vague plans, use if-then statements.
        * “If I finish breakfast, then I’ll write one page of my thesis.”
        * “If I check email, then I’ll only spend 20 minutes max.”
    * This mentally programs your brain to *anticipate* success actions instead of procrastinating.

* **Do one “identity-aligned” behavior, even if it takes 60 seconds**
    * This trick was suggested by Rich Roll in his podcast: ask “What would someone I admire do right now?”
    * Then do the *smallest rep* of that.
        * Want to be a writer? Open your doc and write one sentence.
        * Want to be fit? Do 5 pushups.
        * Want to be calmer? Do 60 seconds of meditation.
    * Behavioral psychologist BJ Fogg (author of *Tiny Habits*) proves that *identity-based habits* stick longer than outcome-based ones. You change faster when it aligns with who you *see yourself becoming.*

* **Protect your first creative hour, no meetings, no replies**
    * Cal Newport (*Deep Work*) calls the first hour “cognitive prime time.” Your brain is fresh, uncluttered, and more likely to engage in creative problem solving.
    * Schedule your tasks *around* this. Defend it like your life depends on it. Research from the *Harvard Business Review* shows people who batch their early focus time outperform peers by 23% in productivity across a week.
    * Block distractions using:
        * A website blocker (Freedom, Cold Turkey, etc.)
        * Prewritten “I’ll respond by noon” autoresponder
        * A whiteboard showing your *1 task only*

---

This isn’t about being perfect every morning. The goal is *consistency without shame*. There’s no need to wake up at 5 AM or drink mushroom tonics. Your mornings should stack real, proven inputs that sharpen your brain, boost mood regulation, and help you make fewer dumb decisions before noon.

Most importantly, remember: these aren’t just habits. They are *investments in your future self*. They make you less reactive and more intentional. Over time, it’s not just about having a “good day.” It’s about becoming someone who can *build good days on demand*",2,1763915191.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

There’s no coffee machine at all in the office, but we’re all coffee drinkers.

One of the colleagues decided to buy a coffee machine for us and asked whether we want to contribute to the purchase. The machine costs about 150, so each of us would pay around 50. After that, we’d all buy our own coffee pods/beans.

One colleague already agreed, and I spontaneously said yes as well. But now I’m second-guessing it.Here’s my situation:

* I’d drink coffee from the machine only 1–2 times per week.
* I’ll probably be in this company for around 2 years.
* So I’m not sure the €50 upfront cost makes sense for me.

I had the idea of suggesting an alternative: instead of paying for the machine, I would put €1 (or some small amount) into a coffee fund each time I use it.

But since I already said yes, I’m wondering:

Is it okay to take back my initial yes?

Would suggesting a per-use contribution come across as weird or cheap?

My husband and I decided to switch to looseleaf tea with our breakfast this morning. We have his grandmother‘s silver tea serving set, my grandmother‘s tea cups, (both were rarely used, it seems like), and a big bag of Earl Grey I got from the Indian market (I *may* have overcommitted). Our rule about taking family heirlooms is that it must be something we’ll actually use. 

I know the general prep (warm the pot first with a bit of hot water first, add a tablespoon per cup of water, plus one, and follow the prescribed steep time, etc) but what we don’t have is the fancy strainer that sits over the cup (I’ve only seen these in videos.) But, here’s the problem: even if we did, the tea leaves seem to be clogging the pot’s pourspout anyway. Is this pot just not meant for looseleaf tea?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

My investing strategy in my Roth IRA for the last year has been about $5/day into several safe ETFs and stocks that I like. You know that whole coffee cup story? This year I am up about 30%. However, even with success, the thought of leverage has been itching in the back of my mind. I regularly trade options and have other riskier investments outside of my Roth IRA, but I also have 40+ years before retirement that I’m looking to take full advantage of.

TQQQ sounds like a fund where timing is key. I understand you lose everything if QQQ drops 34% in a day (which has never happened). So let’s say I take the money I put into SCHD and switch to TQQQ. $5 per trading day. Does it usually DCA? Do you see returns gradually (assuming a steady bull market) or is this entire strategy just a waste? Is it better to buy about $1500 at the beginning of the year?",2,1763914794.0,TQQQ,5,0.75,False

Does the stock market have a bubble? Nov. 17, 2025 – Nov. 21, 2025","First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from November 14 to November 21.

This week, our agenda had 3 main topics: Nvidia's results, Fed rate cut expectations, and tariffs. Tariff pressures decreased compare to recent weeks, but it's still on the table.

📊 Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,

October 24 close at 6,791.69 - October 31 close at 6,840.20 🟢 (+0.71%)

October 31 close at 6,840.20 - November 7 close at 6,728.81 🔴 (-1.63%)

November 7 close at 6,728.81 - November 14 close at 6,734.11 🟢 (+0.08%)

November 14 close at 6,734.11 - November 21 close at 6,602.96 🔴 (-1.95%)

🔸 Monday: After the last two negative days of the previous week, the stock market opened in same path and lower. The economical datas had started from this week. The main focus is Nvidia's result that came after the session of Wednesday's. The flight operations returned to normal. Warren Buffett released his portfolio and revealed $4.9B Google stake, and Google gained more than 3% at the close. It was a bad day. The stock market closed lower more than 1%. The Nasdaq led. 🔴

🔸 Tuesday: The government was closed for 43 days and a lot of data could not be released. Before the session, Jobless Claims for the week ended October 18 were released on the government website at 232K. Meanwhile, Trump said we want 1% inflation. The stock market opened lower again. Fed's Barkin said he agrees with Powell that a December interest rate cut is not a foregone conclusion. Trump also said he has chosen next Fed chair. The stock market closed lower and extended losing streak to 4-day. Gold drooped and jumped $4,000 again. 🔴

🔸 Wednesday: The big day of the week arrived. Nvidia's result had released after the session. Bessent said Trump to decide on the next Federal Reserve Chair before Christmas. The stock market opened higher after 4-day losing streak. During the session, Fed minutes were released and shows that several participants were against rate cut. The stock market closed higher. 🟢

🔸 Thursday: Nvidia released results and Q4 revenue outlook topped estimates. The stock gained more than 5% in the futures market. U.S. continuing jobless claims rise to 1.974M and it's highest since November 2021. The stock market opened higher more than 1%, but it could not hold gains and closed lower more than 1.5% in final hour. The S&P 500 closed at the support around 6,500. It's lowest level since October 14. Nvidia closed lower more than 3%. It has high volatility from 5% to -3%. Gold held steady, but silver crashed. 🔴

🔸 Friday: Trump removed 40% tariff on Brazilian beef and coffee. Fed's Williams said that we don't have insights on whether market overvalued. He also said support for rate cut. The stock market opened higher after Thursday's heavy selling. Michigan 1-Year Inflation Expectations came at 4.5%. It was 4.7% in previous month. The stock market closed higher on renewed rate cut hopes. The S&P 500 gained 1%. 🟢

Nvidia's result was strong. The investors preferred to bull side in futures market, but during the session, it turned to opposite. Rate cut expectations remains uncertain. During the week, The possibility of 25 point rate cut fell below 50% on The CME FedWatch tool, but now it's up to 71%. It was tough week. The S&P 500 dropped 1.95% and it's biggest lost since the week of October 5. It seems that volatility will continue until the Fed rate cut decision. Overall, I'm still optimistic side especially Nasdaq.

What do you think? What do you think? How was your week?
