I-40 was closed at a certain part, a fairly common occurrence after the devastation that Helene caused, and it forced me on a detour through a beautiful scenic route. It has me a bit shaken to be honest.

I passed by the town of Hot Springs where the French Broad River had carved its length through the mountainside, shaping an idyllic town around its natural splendor. The winding roads took me far above the water, and for almost half an hour I twined around its measure. It has me a bit poetic to be honest, but I feel like it's important to describe how it made me feel in the moment. I've been thinking about it ever since. 

I'm not religious, or even particularly spiritual. I don't have tattoos, I've never drank or done drugs - that drive was the first time I've even had a full cup of coffee to stay awake on the road. But the more I think about that moment of wonder, the more disturbed I become. I've come to believe that through my narrow experiences, I've lost something important, and I need help finding it.

Information about me:

* I'm 22M, I'm fairly skinny. I have dark brown eyes and hair, I struggle to smile in photos, and I try to go biking at least once daily. 
* I enjoy video games such as World of Warcraft or CRPGs like Pillars of Eternity & Planescape: Torment. I'm happy to hear about your favorites
* My other hobbies include the aforementioned biking, I run D&D weekly, I have a renewed interest in nature (as you might have guessed), and I'm trying to take more road trips.
* I live in rural South Carolina, I'm a leftist in a very right wing state. Kindred spirits are appreciated. 
* I have a lovely tuxedo cat named Bean

I am open to the following relationships:

* Platonic relationships with either sex
* Romantic relationships with women

I have the following opening questions, answer as many as you like - or none at all:

* What is something you believe in, and fight for?
* Where is a place you want to return to?
* What about the world around you makes you feel hope?
* What about the world around you makes you feel despair? 

The person I'm looking for (platonic):

* I want to talk with somebody who is, in this very moment, passionate about something. I don't care what it is - but I want to know everything about it.
* I have no interest in adult conversations, I want to learn something you care about. 
* Being open to short bursts of conversation might be ideal, but I'd like our discussions to have a communicated ending rather than just being left open ended. 

The person I'm looking for (romantic):

* As I mentioned I'm a straight man, so keep that in mind
* I prefer someone fairly active and healthy, I'm not perfect but I make an effort to stay in reasonable shape, I expect that of any romantic partners as well
* We should share SFW pictures fairly early to make sure attraction is present, I don't think either of us want to waste time
* I hope that you yap a lot because I sure do

I hope that this post is at least a little interesting, I know it's a bit strange. If you're interested in talking to a guy in nature driven crisis send me a chat or DM :)",1,1742847032.0,r4r,0,1.0,False

I hated it so much I wanted to rip it out of my own veins, squeeze it into a dirty rag, and wring it dry. I tried to leave reality behind, but she found me, slit me open, and climbed inside, wearing my skin like a suit, forcing me to be a passenger in my own goddamn corpse.

Depression crept in like black mold, growing, spreading, devouring. My parents—those wrinkled ghosts of disappointment—didn’t respect my will to rot. They threw me into a Support Group for Depressed Young Adults. Forced me to sit in a circle of dead-eyed kids reciting self-pity-like prayer, the stench of stale coffee and institutionalized despair coating the walls.

That’s where I met her.

She wasn’t listening. Just sitting there, gnawing at her nail, peeling it back until it bled. She looked at me, and I knew. I wanted her to ruin me.

Her apartment smelled like dust and metallic perfume. Too clean for a corpse like me. But she didn’t care. She sucked my skin raw, her hands all over, hungry. A rich girl, with rich vices. Too much time, too much money, too much nothing.

I let her take me.

She rode me on the cold floor, sweat pooling in the hollow of her spine. Some song about ""one pill that makes you larger and one pill makes you small"" wheezed through a beaten TE OB-4. On the wall, Pope Innocent X screamed through a cracked TV screen, melting into digital ruin.

Then she whispered, *“See what I see.”*

The vial clicked open. Blue droplets, thick as oil.

I let her do it. My pupils swallowed the room.

Her skin stretched. My fingers melted.

We were moving too fast—flesh grinding, twisting, pressing, no gap, no space. My breath was hers, her bones mine. Her lips on my throat, but were they? I sucked in air and exhaled heat, but whose lungs?

I tried to pull back—but I didn’t pull back.

I couldn’t.

Her hands weren’t on me anymore—they were in me. Our ribs clicked together like a zipper.

No seams. No separation. No stopping.

Muscle laced muscle. Jaw into jaw. Skin stretched thin over something new, something obscene.

We merged. We screamed. We couldn’t stop. We couldn’t unclench.

We couldn’t—

—



She found us the next morning.

The maid.

A woman paid to keep appearances. She opened the door, humming some meaningless pop tune, then

Silence.

A sound, thick, wet.

She dropped the tray. The porcelain shattered.

She saw us.

Not two bodies. One.

Mass, curled fetal on the floor, fused, pulsing, steaming. No clear start, no clean divide. Just limbs where they shouldn’t be, muscle wrapped in impossible places, teeth embedded in skin like broken pearls.

A thing that was two, but now wasn’t.

A single, shuddering mistake.

She gagged. She turned. She vomited.

The thing on the floor—us, me, her, it— twitched. Tried to breathe.

A gurgle. A choke.

The maid backed away, shaking, crossing herself.

Then she ran.",1,1742846879.0,shortscarystories,0,0.67,False

1jj0fl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1jj0fl4/great_experience_at_gh_deer_valley/,Great Experience at GH Deer Valley,"We booked a basic room for 30k points / night with a GOH award from a friend applied. I had read the stories and it all sounded like things that would infurate me for $900 / night but for the low price of free I would shrug off and enjoy being close to DV. TLDR though, we had a fantastic time and the service was top notch.



Our flight was delayed so we did not arrive until 2am. Even though I had called ahead I didn't expect much in terms of check in service at that time of night but I was mistaken. We had full valet service, our car unloaded, ski bags brought to the ski butler, and the rest of our bags brought up to the room even though it was 2am. When I asked at the desk about a room upgrade they said we were upgraded to a room with a nicer view but there were no suites availble. This irked me as I had checked and there were several suites available for our nights, but I knew this happens regularly and wasn't about to make a stink to the night manager about it who probably couldn't do anything anyway.



The lounge was closed so breakfast in the dining room was comped for globalists. There was a small a la carte menu or you could order off the buffet. We did the buffet every morning and it was very solid but not like some of the out of this world hotel breakfast buffets we've experienced around the world. All that to say, I was very satisified for the price of $0 but there's no way I'd pay the $36 + tip sticker price. They never seemed to know our breakfast was included so I reminded them each time, mentally prepared to fight the charges at the end. 



The ski services were fantastic. Every morning our skis were valeted out to the rack in front of the hotel and we left them there to be taken in at the end of the day. There was a nice locker room to change into your boots very close to the exit and a coffee shop on the way out if you needed some fuel for the day. Everyone working the ski valet was very helpful even when there was a little confusion around what skis should be where they handled it super fast. 



Getting to the slopes is very easy. It's about a 5 minute walk uphill or there is a shuttle service that comes every couple of minutes all day. You are at the base of the new heated Keetley lift and from the top can easily get elsewhere on the mountain. One small frustruation was if you want to ski down to the hotel you have to take the small ""Aurora"" lift, so you can't apre until 4:30 or 5 and then ski down. You need to be heading back around 3:45 or you are stuck with no way to get to the East Village. Apparently this will soon be remedied with a new gondola that goes to the East Village. Speaking of which, the GH is the only freestanding building in the East Village area so there's nothing to, you'll need to drive \~15 minutes into Park City. They have a shuttle which departs every 2 hours, but it was pretty small and several large groups were turned away because they didn't have enough seats. They'll definitely need to increase the frequence and/or get a bigger vehicle. 



Our only non-breakfast dining was a quick snack and espresso martinis in the lounge, which were quite good and the food was solid. The pool area was fantastic with many large hot tubs so they were never crowded.



At check out, I was happy to see that all of the breakfasts, valet charges, and resort fees were comped without me having to point out they should be. The staff packed up our car quickly and we were on the road having had a wonderful weekend. Would absolutely return to this property. Overall our stay was fantastic and we would absolutely return.

But here goes. I'm a 29 yr old mechanical engineering grad, years removed from school at this point but I like this community and I've seen some legit great advice on here. I've been working at an engineering sales job for some time that's incredibly easy, low pressure, but also mind numbing. I can feel everything I learned in university slipping away and my actual engineering skills are majorly atrophying. 

With a relatively easy job I thought I'd have plenty of time, money, and energy to pursue personal interest projects outside of work to keep my mind sharp. The problem is this job turns my brain into mush every day and I need weekends to recover, get important responsible adult stuff done, and pursue hobbies. I haven't done much math, CAD, etc. in some time and I don't feel comfortable even claiming the title 'engineer' at this point.

I also took time away from engineering school during covid to learn practical skills at my local community college (welding, machining, drafting). I love to actually fix, design, and build things with my hands as much as I can. But at this point I haven't done any interesting personal projects in several months. I'm low on energy, drinking waaay to much coffee, and working through lunch just to leave as early as possible. Something needs to change.

I'm considering quitting. I have plenty of money saved up, no debt any more, and could easily take a year or more off to recalibrate and actually do something interesting, maybe start a small business. I'd probably get a part time job delivering food or something just to cover bills. I delivered pizza in my late teens into my early 20's and honestly preferred that to what I'm doing now. 

I guess my questions is has anyone else done this (taking a year+ long break) and can you share your experience? How did you go about applying for jobs after the break? Did you bother including any part-time work done on your professional resume? I'm sure I'm not at all unique feeling this way, but I don't have any close engineer friends to speak with about this. I mostly roll with trades workers and technicians who wouldn't be super interested in hearing about this haha.",1,1742846751.0,EngineeringStudents,0,1.0,False

My main issue? My left ear. I don't know what the deal is, but my left ear has always been a problem: if an earbud fits, it usually starts to work its way loose after a short time. Wanna have a miserable listening experience? Have one earbud lose its seal every 10 minutes or so. It's extremely frustrating.

The other issue? My ear canals are pretty sensitive. Some eartips feel like they're burning against my ear canal -- likely due to a latex (or similar) allergy, though it's interesting that I'm not allergic to latex gloves, etc.. It's happens with Comply foam tips, Spinfit, and even the old Shure ""olives"". The Etymotic triple flange eartips don't irritate, but they kinda hurt \*AND\* the depth feels like my ear canals are being assaulted. 

*Blah, blah*. I'm an optimist at heart, so I keep trying new ones that seem like they might work for me.

Just over a year ago, I read a review of the Technics AZ-80 where the author specifically mentioned that these ""finally fit his strange ears"", which definitely piqued my interest. They also come with more ear tip sizes than most, which seemed like a genius idea.

I bit the bullet and ordered.

For the past year, the AZ-80 earbuds have been a near constant companion through home listening, workouts, travel, gaming, and working from a coffee shop. They sound great, have multi-point connections, don't irritate my ear canals, and (most importantly) go in my ears and stay there! I've never been quite sure what the secret sauce is, but it works for me.

Enter the Technics AZ-100.

Like many others, I can fall prey to the ""newer is better"" messaging, and the AZ-100 earbuds looked like everything I love about the AZ-80, but with improved sound, fit, lighterweight, better noise canceling, and improved calling capability. Sure! Let's do it!

The Technics AZ-100 are probably the better choice for most people out there. Do they sound better? Yes, a little. Though (to my ears) it's tough to discern why. I think they burrow into the ear canal further, which may account for the difference. Unfortunately, the new design loosens up in my left ear -- my old nemesis. Obviously I've tried different ear tip sizes -- including the exact tips I used on my AZ-80 -- but the left unit just won't stay put for long. This is *very* apparent during a workout, but even just sitting at my desk at home the left earbud shifts outward before too long.

Oh... and the new eartips? Something changed in the recipe, because these new eartips irritate my ear canals like so many before them. 

The fit issue is enough for me to return them. That's obvious, right? But to shave weight/size, they beveled the outside edge of the earbuds, which makes them more difficult to grab and hold. They feel like they're going to slip out of my fingers -- especially when I'm at the gym. The AZ-80 earbuds feel more confident to hold.

So... back they go, and back *I* go to my trusty AZ-80 earbuds. I'm bummed that they didn't work out for me, but I'm happy that the AZ-80's are still wonderful.

If fitment isn't generally an issue for you, or eartips don't irritate you, or the beveled edges won't bother you, then I'd say grab the AZ-100 earbuds and enjoy to your heart's content ☺",0,1742846684.0,Earbuds,1,0.5,False

I wanted to see the streets that I frequent not be covered in trash I decided to find out how long it would take to fill 2 trash bags worth of litter (the answer is 40 minutes) in Ballard. It was a great activity for a rainy day and I know it isnt going to solve the core problems with trash in the city, but it will certainly reduce the eye sore/pollution that it causes.

**Context:**  
I went to Woodland Coffee in the morning for some light reading and coffee,  shameless plug they have great coffee and a delicious squash bread. Upon parking on 54th I was greeted by trash all over the sidewalk and street in what would otherwise be a pretty nice area in Ballard.

Later that day I came back with a grabber, gloves, two trash bags and a podcast to listen to and started picking away. A guy who lived on the street asked if I was part of any organization and I told him that I wasn't, but I had some free time and was tired of seeing trash in the places that I frequently visit/run/bike by. But this got me thinking that I can't be the only person who is tired of seeing nice neighborhoods covered in all sorts of garbage. I decided to put together a Facebook page called [Clean Seattle Collective (CSC) ](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61574485267426)for people to follow the journey of getting litter off the Seattle streets.

I was fine most of that day at work, and when I was on my way home, I got this slightly numbness at the tip of my tongue. Didn’t think much about it, got home and had a slice of pizza. Then about half way finishing my pizza it started, I suddenly felt this weird sensation swarm over me, like my soul is getting suck out of my body, and my peripheral vision start to darken and narrowing, my heart started to beat really fast and loud, sounded like drum beats right beside my ear. Numbness spread to my lip and face, and my feet and fingers start to tingle, and my lips started to go white. Thought I was having a heart attack. Told my husband to call 911 for me. While waiting for the ambulance I had the great urge to run outside, so I ran onto the yard and started to pace back and forth while my tongue, lips, face, hands and feet still tingle and my heart still beating fast. Also had this extreme tightness in my stomach that made it difficult for me to stand straight. The paramedics arrived a few minutes later and took my vitals and did an ECG for me, which showed nothing wrong with my heart, also checked my motor skills and assured me it’s not a stroke. But my blood pressure was 158/90, and pulse was 152. They said probably a really bad panic attack and asked me to go home and rest, maybe have some hot tea to relax. Had some tremors and brain fog for a couple of days after that and everything seemed to go back to normal.  Thought it was all over and done with. 
And then yesterday I was home listening to music, not doing anything in particular, no triggers I could identify. Maybe the music was a bit loud? Anyway, I once again felt this weird sensation swarming over me, like I’m about to pass out but not really, then my heart beat went crazy over 150, I jumped up and started to pace back and forth again in the room, and it subsided after 10 minutes or so. Not as severe as the first time, but still made me extremely tired, had cold feet and hands for the whole night and some slight shaking. And today I’m just having another brain fog day.

1jj08zt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jj08zt,Some more LV clones!,"Picked up French Avenue Pinnace line. Horrible bottles, horrible packaging, amazing juice! This is one of those fragrances that you tell people the OG name if they ask what you're wearing. I'm sure as hell not telling someone I'm wearing Pinnace 🤣. If you purchase these, be careful when opening. There's a pull tab at the bottom that you pull on to get the slab to come out of some double doors. The doors don't open that great and the slab does not slide well. Also the bottles do not sit securely in the slab. I almost lost the first one I opened. 

All tested on paper. Have only given 2 a full wearing so far.

Pinnace Oryn - right out of the bottle this is amazing! I really like Above the Clouds, it smells like a candied Mandarin. Almost seems like a kids version of Afternoon Swim when compared to Oryn, very linear. Oryn smells like the freshest glass of orange juice you've ever smelled in the opening. Dries down to a creamy, clean, citrus. This is a love for me! Sprayed on my hand around 6 pm. Was still prominently there when I went to bed around 11. Still faintly there at 5 in the morning when I woke up. On skin! If you love citrus, then this is a must. I've got Limoni, Azure, and Above the Clouds. Oryn is leagues better than these, especially when it comes to longevity.

Pinnace - clean, green, citrus. A little menthol vibe to it. It feels like it's clearing my sinuses. Leans very feminine, imo. Don't love it,  don't hate it. It definitely smells of high quality. I've got a couple other Pacific Chill clones. Ocean Breeze is very floral to me, I'm not a fan. Vibe is more fruity, and didn't smell right to me. It's been in the closet for the last several weeks. Maybe Pacific Chill just isn't my thing.

Pinnace Noir - not familiar with what it's cloning, but this stuff smells amazing! A little citrus, Wood, spicy vanilla. Excellent!

Tiramisu Coco - I'm not a fan of Amore Caffè. With that said I like this a lot. One of the few times where I prefer the clone to the OG. Slightly chocolate, coffee.

Tiramisu Caramel. Great clone of Bianco Latte. Definitely not a 1 to 1. It's synthetic like Eclaire, but some people prefer that over the original. Not me, I prefer the OG. Excellent fragrance, though.

Eclaire Affair - smells like a cheap vanilla, going in the closet.

Qasamat Bareeq - another 540 clone. Not as aggressive as Untold, smoother than Barakkat. Still not a fan of this DNA but if I had to pick out of these 3 this would be it.

Victoria  - to the closet. Is not at all what I was expecting. 

Maitha oil - if you are a vanilla fan, especially if you layer, this is a must have. Deep, rich, vanilla. Smells freaking amazing!

Qatar King - one of my weirdest experiences with fragrances yet. On paper it smelled like wet dirt and potting soil. It intrigued me enough to give it a full wearing the next day. I totally expected to smell like swamp thing. This literally smells like a grape Invictus flanker for the first hour or so then dries down to a very light, clean, vanilla. My wife and I are very perplexed.

Qatar Queen - this may very well be my favorite women's perfume. Definitely favorite women's clone of all time. Opens very fruity, effervescent, pungent. There's no grape listed in the notes, maybe it's just the color of the bottle subliminally messing with my head, but it smells like grape Kool-aid in the initial blast. It radiates off my wife's skin. Entrances me. I freaking love this stuff! If anyone knows what this is cloning please, please let me know. I have to get my nose on the OG.

Raeese Gold - another top tier clone by Jo Milano. This is my favorite clone house, and there's not much competition. Imo. Excellent clone of Le Male Elixer. Heavy on the honey, but that's right out of the box. Very smooth.

Art of Wood - very similar to Perseus, just has a added vanilla note. It's nice but I prefer Perseus. My wife tried this on her arm and hated it. She doesn't really care for me wearing Perseus either. If you're looking for a 1 to 1 you won't be happy, but if you like a little sweetness with your Wood, then this is for you.

Bronzite - Tygar clone. Smells like Turathi Blue, and Al Qiam Silver.

Just Aswad - smoother than Asad, Just not a Sauvage fan

Imperium X - you are the pineyest pine tree that ever existed.

These are all just initial thoughts. Nothing has had time to mature, so take it for what it's worth. I'm horrible on updating reviews, but I try to help with input on others posts when I can.

&nbsp;

It’s been a couple days, and the thieves guild hasn’t done anything.  No, they’ve done something, just not something that makes them look strong, which sets off warning bells for me.  I wish we had been able to get a foothold into their headquarters before it happened, but wishing won’t help it now.

&nbsp;

A big chunk of the guild left town.  Karn says it looks like a schism, but it looked to me like he also felt something’s up.  As much as I feel like we need to learn more, I don’t think I can really step up the spying operations right now.  I already have bees wandering all over their guild, being nice and obvious.  If I send even *more* bees, it’d definitely tip them off that I’m not buying whatever they’re trying to sell.

&nbsp;

I think at this point, it’s better to stay in the dark and let them think I don’t know, instead of confirming it.  It’s annoying to be the one in the dark for a change, but I think if I press more right now, it’ll tip them off to how much I actually do know.  And with Cappy finally making good headway into their headquarters, I’d rather let them think they have me.  If they’re confident, maybe Cappy can hear what they’re up to.

&nbsp;

So yeah, half the guild is gone, and the other half doesn’t seem too worried.  They even seem to have more money to throw around, if the activity at a few seedy bars is any indication.  It makes me think the Earl has paid them for whatever they’re up to.  If it was a schism, whichever faction came out on top always has a bit of a celebration of cash and such, but I still feel like something’s off.

&nbsp;

“I can only do so big of a sigh for you, Boss,” teases Teemo, and I chuckle as he pulls me from my thoughts.  He’s right.  Sighing and worrying aren’t going to help, and I have better things to do than just mope and try to guess what the Earl and the guild are going to do.  It’s like with the infiltration of Hullbreak: some parts of a plan just need time to develop.  And with the Tree of Cycles and the Forest of Four Seasons, I have a lot of things to develop while I let Zorro and Cappy do their jobs.

&nbsp;

Constantly looking over their shoulders won’t help me, and won’t make them do their jobs any faster.  Patience is what I need, or at least a distraction.  Luckily, I have a lot to distract me.

&nbsp;

While I’ve been busy trying to thwart the Earl, the delvers are still happily delving.  In fact, now that the thieves seem to be backing off, it feels like the casual delvers are trying to make up for lost time.

&nbsp;

The manor and yard are always going to be popular, but now the caverns and the crypt complex are getting more attention, too.  The weekend warriors are starting to get good enough to brave the harder areas.  I would try to serve their needs better with my next expansion, but I have enough on my plate right now.  Besides, I think it could be a good niche for Violet to try to fill eventually.  She’s still a bit nervous about combat challenges, but with how eager Onyx is to have some fun, I think she’s seriously considering it.

&nbsp;

Not any time soon, but I wouldn’t be surprised if her eventual next expansion will be into the aquifer lakes for a medium challenge combat area.  I bet she and Hullbreak would have fun working together on some watery denizens.

&nbsp;

Hullbreak’s own expansion is going well, too.  He’s carving up into the cliffs now, and seems to be playing with the idea of timing something with the tides.  He carved a lot under the water, too, so I’m interested to see where he’s going with it.  Using water to act as a timer for delvers is a pretty slick idea and could make puzzles or combat more interesting.  I’m trying not to poke my nose too into it, but I’m looking forward to what he makes.

&nbsp;

But I can’t get too distracted with what my friends are doing and lose track of my own project.  There’s actually an interesting issue developing that I’m not sure what the best solution would be.  The four seasons have been established long enough that some cracks are starting to show.

&nbsp;

In nature, the cycle keeps everything balanced.  Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter all keep their balance by taking their turn everywhere.  My sections, though, are going to be those seasons forever, or at least as long as I keep them working.  Spring is all about waking up, getting started, new growth and so on.  But it’s hard to perpetually be waking up.  Eventually, you’re going to be fully awake, depending on how much coffee is needed.

&nbsp;

Summer, I think, is easier to keep going, same with Winter.  Summer is growing, Winter is sleeping.  There’s things to keep track of, for sure, but they’re both pretty stable.  Fall is like Spring, but in the opposite direction.  It’s going to bed, finishing, preparing, a state naturally leading to another one.  So what are the options?

&nbsp;

Well, one would be to not make them static.  I’m already moving a lot of things around, I don’t think it’d be too difficult to slowly move the entire thing around, too.  It’d be a big wheel, lazily spinning along and dragging the four seasons with it.  The biggest problem is my spawners.

&nbsp;

The wolves basically need to be in Winter.  If their spawner was in summer, they’d be miserable, and a big part of why I wanted to make the forest was to be able to really lean into the seasons with denizens that excel in each.

&nbsp;

The other option is to basically keep doing what I’m doing.  Titania has been great at organizing the denizens, and even with her lab and research, Poppy is starting to step into the role of making sure the environment works smoothly.  And helping them each, is Goldilocks, and a lot of my resource denizens.  The rats are especially helpful with maintenance in general.  New shoots are always needing to be moved from Spring into Summer, leaf litter in Fall needs to be moved around to keep Spring and Summer working without too much mana consumption, and so on.

&nbsp;

If I had more mundane stuff, it probably wouldn’t work.  But I have a lot of magical things to grow.  The fruitbats have been proving their worth, populating the sections with plenty of cool flora, and I think Poppy is experimenting with magically adapting the trees to fit better in their seasons, too.  The denizens are settling into their seasonal niches well, and I’m getting enough mana that I can start upgrading some more, even with me making payments back into the ally pool.  I’m probably going to leave the plant spawner alone for a bit, because I want to give it spatial affinity before I upgrade it.  I’m also getting tempted to give the snake spawner the last push to get ready for another enclave, maybe even with the birds and the bees, too.  That’d be a *big* project, though, and definitely one to tackle *after* I have the forest properly situated.

&nbsp;

That doesn’t mean I can’t lay the groundwork at least a bit.  The bees and snakes not only have the lair upgrade, but only have one more denizen type to go until they’re maxed.  My birds don’t have a lair yet, and are a full denizen behind, too!  I eye the costs and what I have to spend, and it looks like it won’t be too bad.  I could wait until after my Sanctum goes public, but I should be fine to upgrade them now.

&nbsp;

I start with the lair, moving the spawner from atop the manor and into the canopy of the Tree of Cycles.  Caws echo as the spawn rate increases dramatically, and I can feel gratitude and satisfaction from Poe especially.  Not only will he be better able to keep an eye on the surroundings, but if he needs to smack around some of the Earl’s people, he’ll have that many more birds to do it with.

&nbsp;

He’s also going to get a new variety to go with the new numbers.  While there’s a lot of options, I’m leaning toward the simple one of bigger birds.  I lock in the new upgrade and watch the new dire raven hatch.  It doesn’t come out all gooey and nightmarish like a normal baby bird, probably because it’s an adult.

&nbsp;

A normal raven is around a foot, maybe a foot and a half tall.  Poe is a good six feet, though posture can make him look taller or shorter.  The dire ravens come in at about the halfway point, almost four feet tall.  They also look a lot meaner than the other birds, and even meaner than most of my other denizens.

&nbsp;

I probably should have expected it, I even saw it in the description, but reading and seeing are two different things.  They even have death affinity, which is a little scary.  I don’t think they’re going to be doing like Grim did to that scythemaw and just turning their foes off, but I do think they’ll be foes the stronger delvers will need to be careful around.

&nbsp;

They have huge wings and oversized talons, as well as piercing glares.  The last I don’t think is actually anything they can attack with, but they do look pretty intimidating.  Which makes the almost childlike curiosity I feel from it all the more amusing.  From what I can tell, mentally, they’re similar to what would usually be the last denizen from a spawner.  They do say corvids are smart.  While I get a good look at my new denizen, I feel Poe call for it to give its first expedition.

&nbsp;

Poe also has a new report for me, and I think he’s happy to have the new, bigger birds to send out.  At the edge of what he can cover, he just got a report of a lot of armed and armored elves walking down the road.  Most are on foot, with a few on horseback, as well as several large wagons of supplies.  There’s a lot more detail than usual, I guess the ravens really like the shiny armor and colorful banners and flags.

&nbsp;

I pat Poe though the bond, hoping he can encourage the expeditions to maybe learn heraldry.  It’s not needed here, but it could be useful in the future.  Not all marching armies will be waving the banner of Horlon, the current king.

1jj06tq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jj06tq,Turning a replica sword into the Shards of Narsil,"Hello! 

I hope this is the right sub for this. 

To cut a long story short, I bought a replica of Aragorn’s sword Anduril, with the intention to cut it up, and display it in a glass coffee table in the front room.

I messaged a few local blacksmiths who were not willing to help me cut it up. So here I am, 1 year later, the sword has come out of storage as we have just bought our house and moved in - it’s a little rusty I know, I’m sorry if that is painful to see! 

What is the general verdict? Do you in this community think that slicing this sword up is possible? I will clean it up regardless and display it on the wall whole if not, but I would ideally like it on display in its shard form as in the film!

Any and all comments would be helpful!

If you want to make something automatic, effortless, and impressive, do it a lot. This works for anything... positive and negative.

You weren’t always good at driving, but here you are, always going 80 on the highway, zooming past grandma. You taught yourself how to drive fast.  Like clockwork, you know who is going to move and who isn’t. So don’t get mad at the cop for giving you a ticket... you trained yourself to drive like that.

Don’t beat yourself up when you find yourself getting sleepy while driving. It’s probably something your parents trained you to do. But don’t blame them either... because you probably still sleep in your car during lunch breaks. Resist the urge to nap in your car, and you won’t find yourself getting drowsy in traffic or on long drives.

Laying in your bed and looking at your phone... then wondering why you have insomnia. Don’t blame your brain and punish it with pills. Your brain has linked your bed with wakefulness, not sleep. So even when you put the phone down, your body isn’t ready to rest.

Eating while watching TV, then hating yourself for snacking all the time. (Commercials also use this method to train you to desire their food.) You trained your brain to connect food with entertainment... and now you’re punishing yourself for something you taught it to do.

Always drinking coffee while working, then blaming yourself for being useless without caffeine. Your brain isn’t broken, it just thinks coffee is the only way to focus because you made it that way.

Checking your phone every time you're bored, then hating how distracted you are during conversations. You trained yourself to be constantly engaged on your phone, and now you’re punishing yourself for something you taught yourself to crave.

Using a background noise to fall asleep, then blaming silence for keeping you awake. You didn’t need noise as a kid... but now you’ve made it impossible to sleep without it.

Always venting about problems instead of solving them... then wondering why you always feel stuck. Complaining feels good, but it’s also training your brain to find comfort in problems instead of fixing them. Now you hate being stuck but you don’t know how to break the cycle.

Procrastinating until the last minute, then wondering why you only feeling motivated under pressure. You don’t need stress to work... you just trained yourself to believe you do.

Avoiding any exercise because you associate it with chores, and exhaustion, then blaming yourself for not having the energy to move. Your body isn’t weak, it’s just following how you’ve trained it. Teach it to crave movement instead of dreading it.

Getting paid and then immediately spending it all... then a few days later complaining about not having money. You weren’t born bad with money... you just trained yourself to see a paycheck as a reason to spend and not to save.

Now that you know, stop punishing yourself and make the choice now to stop and reflect and choose differently. And when you start to train yourself properly with mini steps, be sure to reward yourself with mini rewards as it will help you learn faster. It’s probably going to suck initially, but it won’t last.

How long it takes to retrain yourself depends on how strong your memory is. The deeper the habit, the longer it takes to rewire... but it’s never impossible.

I work for myself from home, so with the flexibility, I have plenty of time to dive into hobbies that keep me grounded—cooking and baking (a passion since I was a kid!) are definitely at the top of the list. There’s something magical about creating something from scratch and watching it come together. Running helps clear my head, and hitting the gym keeps me balanced mentally and physically. When I’m not doing any of that, you’ll likely find me hanging out with my pets 🐾 or sipping coffee in a cozy cafe ☕, just enjoying the little things.

I’m really looking for genuine connections. Connections that go beyond surface level stuff. I’m all about effort in the small things: a thoughtful message, a shared laugh, or just knowing that someone gets it. Deep conversations that make you feel heard are just as important as those light chats that make you smile. And it’s not just about the big talks, sometimes it is about those in between moments where you can be comfortable without saying much at all. I appreciate the quiet things too, like the companionship of a pet or the feeling of finishing a run and just letting the day settle. That kind of ease and comfort is something I value in any connection.

I value authenticity, kindness, and that easy comfort you get when you know you can just be. I’m drawn to people who make an effort, but also those who understand that effort shouldn’t always feel like work. When it’s right, it flows naturally. I’m looking for someone who knows that the best connections come when you are both just present, when it feels effortless, even in the small moments. So if you’re someone who finds meaning in the little things, values authenticity, and is down for real, easygoing chats, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s connect, share some thoughts, and see where it goes! 😊",1,1742846210.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

[Viral Persistence and Serotonin Reduction Can Cause Long COVID Symptoms](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2023/october/penn-study-finds-serotonin-reduction-causes-long-covid-symptoms)

Among the SSRIs, those with the highest affinity for sigma-1 receptor agonism—primarily, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, escitalopram, and citalopram—may be of greatest benefit. As noted above, preliminary data suggest that certain long COVID symptoms (eg, fatigue, brain fog, and post-COVID dysphoria) may be most responsive to SSRIs, although more research is needed to better characterize specific response rates. 

[In doing research of long covid, SSRIs, and fluvoxamine, you’ll see it mentioned as a top choice. Here’s one such article](https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/growing-evidence-potential-use-antidepressants-long-covid)

>...Fluvoxamine can stabilize mast cells, such that
fluvoxamine can reduce histamine release from mast cells as well as reduce cytokine storms in COVID-19.

>Adrenaline dumps can also trigger histamine dumps.
While not directly causing a ""dump"" in the same way, adrenaline release (an adrenaline ""dump"") can indirectly trigger a histamine release in the body, meaning that experiencing a surge of adrenaline can potentially lead to increased histamine levels, which could manifest as histamine-like symptoms in some individuals; this is because both systems are involved in the body's stress response.

MCAS can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, vertigo, cognitive dysfunction, and paresthesia. When mast cells are activated in MCAS, they release chemicals like histamine, which can impact nerve signaling, leading to sensations like tingling or numbness.

I have Paresthesia. Paresthesia (numbness and tingling sensations) is considered a common neurological symptom associated with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), often reported by individuals with this condition; it can manifest as tingling in various parts of the body due to the release of mast cell mediators affecting nerve function. 

I wrote a post about this: [MCAS and ME/CFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/s/sGU7tz6rJD)

[Food Compatibility List-Histamine/MCAS](https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/SIGHI-FoodList_EN_Histamin_alphabetisch_inKategorien.pdf)

I take low-dose Fluvoxamine 25mg for ME/CFS symptoms. Fluvoxamine is an SSRI used for OCD. It's prescribed off-label in low-dose for long covid/ME/CFS symptoms. I have improved REM, deep sleep, and overall hours slept. I'm seeing improvements in dysautonomia symptoms and orthostatic intolerance. 
The dizziness and lightheadedness has significantly improved.

Hyperesthesia is a neurological condition that causes extreme sensitivity to one or more of the senses, including touch, pressure, pain, temperature, light, sound, taste, and smell. I had hyperesthesia in all five senses, down to the texture of my food. I'm able to tolerate more bright light and loud sound, and my taste and smell are significantly less heightened. I can handle warmer/hot showers. My pain is significantly less strong. My pressure sensitivities haven't lowered. However, I suspect there are other reasons for that.

My ME/CFS specialist just increased my Fluvoxamine from 25mg to 50mg daily. I'll start with 37.5mg for two months. I'm hypersensitive to all medications and supplements. I take Diazepam for Dysautonomia.

I developed MCAS in September. I followed the H1 and H2 histamine blocker protocol. I couldn't tolerate the fillers in those medications. I'm taking Hydroxyzine (prescribed H1 antihistamine) and Fluticasone (corticosteroid) for MCAS. And Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer).
I take Valacyclovir 1g for reactive EBV and HSV. 

I take prebiotic psyllium husk and probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus. I take NatureBell L-tryptophan and L-theanine complex. Or I take Magnesiu-OM powder (magnesium 3 types and L-theanine) mixed in tart cherry juice (melatonin and tryptophan) 1-2 hours before bed. I alternate between the two. I purchased them from Amazon. They significantly help with calmness, muscle cramps, pain, relaxation, and sleep.

It's essential to create a routine if you're able. I wake up and go to bed within the same two hour window. 
I go to bed between 10-12am and wake up between 8am-10am. I sleep 10-12 hours a day. I created good sleep hygiene. I take my medications and supplements at the same time every day. I eat and have my snacks at the same time every day. Everything functions best when I maintain this schedule. 

I shared all this because MCAS is prevalent in long covid. It's a combination of things I do that improve my overall symptoms. Tachycardia, adrenaline dumps, histamine dumps, shortness of breath, and air hunger were among some of my worst symptoms. A low histamine diet, medications, supplements, prebiotic fiber, probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, plenty of rest, and good sleep hygiene significantly alleviated these symptoms. 

I'm learning more about how covid has decimated our microbiome. Have you looked into this?

13. Intermittent fasting 10/14 or 8/16 eat/fast schedule 
14. Aggressively resting, pacing, and avoiding PEM.
15. Good sleep hygiene. Sleep 10-12 hours a night.

I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune hypothyroidism, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. All diagnosed in a 11 month timespan after I developed long covid. My ME/CFS is severe. I've been bedridden for 15 months. I'm finally seeing some real improvements. I hope to encourage other people who are severe like me. Hugs❤️

I examined every part of my life. I overhauled my diet. I created a daily schedule for meals, snacks, medications, and vitamins. I created good sleep hygiene. I became my own health advocate. I created a collaborative relationship with my doctors. I fill my time with things that are funny, distracting, and engaging. I practice gratitude every day. I remember to laugh every day. 

I protect my peace by cultivating a routine. I don't think too far into the future. I focus on what I'm doing today. I struggled with mental health issues in my journey to being diagnosed. I've taken medications and done counseling in the past to deal with those things. I no longer struggle with those mental health issues. Though my physical health issues have changed, I respect my mind and body. I appreciate what it can do while honoring my limitations. Learning to recognize my mental and physical cues helps with resting, pacing, and avoiding PEM. I'm a believer in doing whatever I can to improve my overall symptoms.

I completely overhauled my diet last year. I did an anti-inflammation diet. My dysautonomia and hypothyroidism caused non-diabetic nocturnal hypoglycemia attacks. I had to change my diet. I added premier protein shakes with 30 grams of protein. My favorite flavors are cake batter, cinnamon roll, lemon, and peanut butter cup. And fruit cups or applesauce without added sugar. That way, I get protein, carbohydrates, and natural sugar added into my diet. I have blueberries with peanut butter. I have low-fat cottage cheese with fruit like watermelon or bananas. I love salads and vegetables but I can't eat much of it. I have complex carbohydrates like whole wheat pasta and sweet potato fries are better. I like frozen chicken breasts and frozen precut vegetables like carrots, green beans, peas, and butternut squash. 
Recently, I have noticed that my symptoms are more severe than they used to be. I added more meat, dairy, and complex carbohydrates into my diet. The changes I've made include: I've added yogurt into my diet. I have potato bowls with potatoes, some shredded cheese, and canned chicken or ground beef for dinner. I was diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) in September 2024. I switched to a low histamine diet. I've added foods back in as tolerated.

I do limit processed carbohydrates, additives, and sugars. I love chocolate cake and have a slice 1-2 times a month. I have takeout 1-2 times a month. I stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. I've stopped drinking coffee and soda. Though, I'm adding coffee back into my diet. No caffeine after 6pm.

I do intermittent fasting as well. I'll have an eating/fast window of: 8hr/16hr or 10hr/14hr. That's typically intermittent fasting for 14-16 hours. Some days I don't follow it. You have to keep your metabolism guessing. Our bodies get very efficient at estimating the number of calories we eat. It holds onto the calories and inhibits weight loss. I lost 40lbs last year.

It's essential to create a routine if you're able. I wake up and go to bed within the same two hour window. 
I go to bed between 10-12am and wake up between 8am-10am. I sleep 10-12 hours a day. I created good sleep hygiene. I take my medications and supplements at the same time every day. I eat and have my snacks at the same time every day. Everything functions best when I maintain this schedule.

I believe in using my doctors as resources. It's important to be your own advocate. Don't stop advocating. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune hypothyroidism. I started thyroid medication for it. If I hadn't pushed my doctor repeatedly for more testing, I wouldn't have been diagnosed. I pushed for a referral for a neurologist. For dysautonomia testing and evaluation. I asked for a referral to the ME/CFS clinic and specialist. My appointment was last month. Now I have an ME/CFS specialist, too. We work in collaboration. I have a treatment plan and access to resources.

I watch a lot of comedy shows. Like Seinfeld, 
King of Queens, The office, Schitt's Creek. Or shows that are engaging and distracting, like Law & Order. There are great series streaming on Hulu, Netflix, and Peacock. I'm streaming on Tubi right now, which is free. They have a large collection of movies. Sometimes, I'll watch the same movie repeatedly for background noise, like white noise. I find streaming shows I've already seen takes up substantially less brain power. I have a loving and supportive husband and lots of fur babies. I have 11 cats, all rescues. I've had 9 since they were babies. I make my husband laugh every day. Most of all, don't let the diagnoses crush your spirit.

Being in this community and being active is so important. We all have these struggles. It's okay to not be okay. Some days are hard. I try my best to choose positivity. When I lived in the depression, anger, and darkness, it ate at my soul. I may visit there, but I refuse to live there. My diagnoses aren't going to rob me by stealing my joy. Though some days they try.
 
Here's the short version:                                        
1) Learn to aggressively rest, pace, and avoid PEM as much as possible.                                                             
2) Learn to listen to your own body and its cues. It becomes a superpower when you learn how to use it.
3) Smaller snack-sized meals work better for me 3-5 a day. Focus on more protein, natural carbohydrates, and natural sugar.                                                              
4) Stay hydrated. Add electrolytes if needed. Limit caffeine intake.                                                                   
5) Invest in a high-quality multivitamin and a few selected supplements.                                                         
6) Create good sleep hygiene.                                            
7) Use your doctors as resources. Don't take any medications without research and investigation yourself. Don't be afraid to trial medications. They help many of my symptoms, even though some symptoms are minimally improved at best.                                                                        
8) Mental health and mindset are important. I find things to laugh about every day. Gratitude is so important. Acceptance of my medical limitations and reality is essential. It doesn't mean I'm without hope. If I can achieve a 30-50% improvement in my overall symptoms, I'll consider it a win.     
9) Box breathing, meditation, and Yoga Nidra are beneficial.                                                                              
10) Find things that occupy your time. I watch TV shows and movies on my cell phone with the brightness and volume turned down. I use an earplug in one ear and a noise canceling earbud in the other.                                  

I was diagnosed Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, and Hashimotos disease, an autoimmune hypothyroidism, Dysautonomia, and MCAS. All diagnosed after I developed long covid. I am severe and have been bedridden for 15 months. Many of my symptoms have significantly improved. My journey hasn't been linear. However, I finally have a regimen that works for me.

1jj04r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jj04r2/stories_from_the_park/,Stories from the park,"Hi everyone.  I’m not new to a message board/forum environment, but usually I just like to see what’s going on with my favorite topics and interests.  I don’t message, comment, or present anything.  I’m a bump on a log, or a fly on the wall.  Or a fly on the log.  Or a bump on the, you get it.

However.  After what I’ve experienced in the last 18 months, I think maybe this is the place to leave my stories.  Maybe someone out there will be able to help explain or just be entertained by the unexplained.  I’ll say right now, while I enjoy paranormal, the spooky, the strange, I don’t completely believe that there’s gouls and goblins in our real life.  I believe in human beings being awful and that’s usually how we explain how bad things happen to good people.  Or bad people.

 

Brace yourselves, here’s the part where I introduce myself and give you a little backstory.  I know, lame and boring, but this has to be done to give you context.  You can glaze past this part, there’s nothing particularly interesting or scary about this but please, I implore you, I don’t think it’ll make as much sense if you do.

 

I’m a lawman.  I’ve been in law enforcement for 17 years now.  Considering I’ve just hit 40 years-old, that’s a good chunk of my life.  I’ve had plenty of “weird,” experiences on the street, we all have, but nothing I can’t find logic in.  Sometimes I have to try a little harder to find that logic, but logic none the less.

 

Every cop has their one or two freaky stories.  Not sad, or intense, we’ve all had dozens or 100’s of those.  I mean freaky.  Dark houses, looking for people, hearing things on midnights, it’s all there.  My partner and I on an electronic monitoring unit (tether,) were looking for someone that cut their device off.  We were interviewing a family member of the offender and proceeded to search a house that seemed to change its makeup every corner we changed.  I was searching rooms I swear I was just in.  Hallways went on forever.  I went up a stairway that just.. ended at a door that opened to a brick wall.  Weird stuff.

 

I also searched for another absconder (the official term we use when someone destroys or cuts off their device,” in a house that just didn’t make sense.  Floors and floors of unlimited doors/rooms.  We found him, but the unease in the air was insane.  Stuff like that that didn’t make sense.

At the very end of 2020, I decided it was time for a change.  The department I was in was reeling from short staff, changing tides in law enforcement policies and support, and basement-level morale.  It was a bad time for me, law enforcement, and the world entirely.  I don’t need to go into more detail about this time.  I’m sure no one wants to relive that time. 

 

I straight up quit.  Not knowing my next move, I drowned myself in alcohol and other unhealthy behaviors, feeling sorry for my seemingly lost career, and a lost sense of self.  I took a job for one of those armored truck carriers.  The job was decent enough, although didn’t pay very well.  And it also was just not as fulfilling as my police career. 

 

One day, while riding in the back of a bullet-proof armored vehicle filled with several million dollars’ worth of currency, I decided to look online for open law enforcement jobs.  Like most professions following the virus, there were dozens, if not hundreds, of jobs available.  One caught my eye.  It was close and seemed interesting. 

 

The MetroPark Police Agency was hiring a part-time Officer.  The job description was patrolling several parks in the area.  Park Police, I thought.  Not what I intended for my life, but it would keep my certification ( you have a year to renew your license before you lost it,) and I’d be outside almost entirely, which was something I could use right now.  Especially after being bounced around in the back of a tank, responsible for incredible numbers of money every day.  The job was physical and soul-crushing.  It didn’t require much brain power either.

 

I’ll fast forward a bit now.  I had gotten the job quite easily, being that the recruiter happened to be one of my instructors in the Police academy all those years ago.  We always had a good relationship and he actually remembered me.  I was assigned to the eastern district in the parks.  Close to home.  The worst day here was handling minors in possession, maybe some family problems, and your run of the mill medical calls.  I found a good position and some even better co-workers.  I worked my way up to a full-time spot and truly couldn’t have been luckier to have my career back on track.  Everything was copes thetic.  Then the uncanny bits started.

The parks after dark are already creepy enough.  We don’t have streetlights like normal neighborhoods.  For the most part our parks are a giant circle, or oval roadway that leads into various picnic shelters.  Both of the parks I’m responsible for has a beach, and one has a pool.  Not much more than that.

Story 1: The Wolf of Winter Cove

On normal, routine patrol.  It’s getting close to closing time so I’m making my last rounds across the park.  One of the bigger areas of the place is called winter cove.  No idea why.  There’s plenty of wildlife to be seen, especially after dark.  Deer, raccoons, possums, and the occasional fox and coyotes.  This was not a coyote, I was certain.  I grew up in a remote part of the state, about as far north as you can go without crossing over into Canadian territory.  Where I am now is much further south.  I’ve seen coyotes.  And I’ve seen Wolves.  Let me be clear that you would never mistake a coyote, or even a common domesticated dog, as big as they can be, for a wolf. 

 

A lot of things flew through my head.  Holy shit was the first one.  Am I really seeing a wolf here?  I didn’t think there were any in my area, like in the history of this place being a place.  Up north, sure, but not here.  Another thought was .. shit, I have to notify someone.  If there’s an actual wolf around here, people need to know.  Right?  As I finished that thought, the damn thing just stopped and stared at me.  This is how I know it was what I thought it was.  The big guy was just .. powerful.  I’ve never felt anything like that from any animal, not even a human.

 

Then he, or she, or it, vanished.  This would have been interesting enough on its own, I think, but when I shook the wonderment from my noggin, I drove to the oppose end of the park.  A good 15 minute drive or so.  When I pulled into West Water beach… it was there.  The same wolf, now almost expecting me in the middle of the drive into the beach.  Not a damn chance this thing ran all the way here and beat me.  Now, I’ve looked it up.  Wolves can run from anywhere to 31-37 MPH.  According to intensive research reached by googling.  So, POSSIBLY, this could have happened, but realistically I can’t honestly believe this.  Wolves, or any animal really, don’t just run nonstop for minutes on end. 

 

Wanting to get a closer look to confirm, wasn’t believing what I was seeing, I pulled forward slowly.  Unfortunately, the radio perked up, taking my attention away from the beast.  When I looked back, it was gone.  This has happened over a dozen times this week.  Got a teleporting wolf in my park. 

This is a tame one to start my tales.  I’ll just finish with two things.  Weeks later, I had to train a new officer.  This was their first phase in the FTO program.  On an unassuming April night, my trainee and I were involved in a pretty nasty Domestic Assault.  Not on each other, obviously.  This was in the Winter Bay picnic area.  I was happy with the rookie’s performance.  First time she drew her firearm, and nobody got hurt.  After we were done transporting shithead to jail, we parked back at winter cove to debrief.  Not expecting a third member to join, the wolf was just outside of the tree line that leads into the forest.  Despite telling her several times where the famous-to-me wolf of winter bay was, she said she could not see it.

 

After the first appearance, I sent a message and picture to one of my DNR buddies, excited to let him know of my Canis lupus discover.  This was his response:  “Number one- there are absolutely no wolves in this area.  Number two – all I see from that picture is just a grassy hill, maybe some trees in the background.”

 

Story 2: The Charlie Brown Lady

 

This is second hand from another partner.  I just thought it was freaky, so I wanted to include it here. 

 

We have a lot of “strange,” people at the park.  I’m sure most parks across the country do.  There’s just some kind of magnetic pull that brings them here.  It’s open, it’s quiet, it gives a type of freedom.  It also seems you allow you to do wacky shit that most of the regular world would look sideways at.  If you saw a guy playing an electric guitar on a unicycle just going in circles on the street, you would probably find that slightly out of the ordinary.  Here, that’s just a regular Tuesday, baby.

 

My partner had a run-in with one of those strange patrons over the last Christmas season.  I like to say that in this 24/7 world, even the biggest Christmas store in America is closed on Christmas.  Not us.  You can visit the park, for a fee, every single day of the year.  This wasn’t Christmas day, but probably within two weeks or so.  What follows is me paraphrasing my partner’s experience.

 

Officer Friendly making his rounds and pulling into one of our many picnic areas to start closing.  Friendly has noticed an elderly woman sitting at a bench for well over 3-4 hours.  Not strange here, people spend all day at the park.  But this is mid-December.  And it has been a particularly cold winter.  He did notice that she had what appeared to be a heater plugged in one of the outlets we provide.  Still time to go, though.  Friendly uses his PA to announce the park is going to close in about an hour.  No movement from her when he checked back within 30 minutes.  Friendly makes one more announcement and races back to close up the remaining areas that do not have anyone in them.

This is the wild part.  Mind you, I’m also working this night, and taking care of the opposite end of the park.  After we close and head back to the station, Friendly looks at me with wild eyes.  

 

“After everything was closed, I made my way back to see if that old lady had left.  Still there.  Now, I know she heard my announcements.  So, I got out of the car, and as soon as I was within about 20-30 feet, I heard that Charlie Brown Christmas theme playing.  That thing she had plugged into the picnic area wasn’t a heater, it was a radio.  Over 4 hours sitting in the freezing cold.  That upbeat Christmas song playing just made things so.. eerie.”

He looked like he was legitimately shaken up.

“What happened, when you got up to her?” I asked, now genuinely wondering how this turned out.

“I announced who I was, that she had to leave, blah, blah.  No response.  And boss, I was now right behind her.  So, I gently put my hand on her shoulder, letting her know she had to vacate immediately.  Her head started to turn, but not to the side.. it was starting to move backward, like she was about to look toward the sky.. and .. and her damn head just fell off!”

“Holy shit, man!  What are you doing here, we have to get people out here, tape off the scene, fu-“

As I was bumbling to run back out the door to fly to her location, I happened to glance back and see Friendly hunched over, face red as a Christmas berry.  As soon as I caught his sight he launched into uncontrolled laughter.  This motherfucker.

“Ah.. ok, good one.  You got me.  That’ll never happen again.  Get dressed.” I wasn’t entirely mad, but I didn’t exactly delight in the possibility of a decapitated women in my park.  He tried to walk it back and almost apologize but I wasn’t in the mood.  I waited until he got dressed and left before I did.

Admittedly, that wasn’t seriously freaky, more of a joke, but imagining that ladies head roll back completely off her shoulders stuck with me.  The next and lost story is something I truly can’t explain.

Story 3: The Lighthouse

After getting promoted and accepting a new position at another park, I was happy for the change of scenery, and to be much closer to home.  The park’s main draw is a good-sized lake that has quite an impressive beach front.  At least for the somewhat residential area it surrounds.  This isn’t a tourist spot or anything, it’s just a lake that generations of families have grown up going to.

Not only do I live within a 20-minute drive of the park I currently work in, but I also live next to a pretty impressive lighthouse.  Not a traditional lighthouse, it’s actually an apartment complex that has about 20 floors, but there’s a giant light on top to guide boaters and sailors and it’s a good landmark when you’re on the lake.  Side note:  I think the state I live in has by far the most lighthouses.  I’m not going to google it, just something that popped into my head.  Also, second side note, if you’re having a conversation with someone and ask a benign question like “Oh, I recognize that actor, what else do I know them from,” or “Man, I know the lead singers name of that band, why can’t I think of it?”  You don’t have to look it up.  You also don’t have to look it up on someone else’s behalf.  Just have the conversation and if you remember, great.  If it really bothers you, then fine.  Sorry, back on track.

I can see the lighthouse from work, which I like.  I know however bad my day is going, I’m still close to home.  While driving to a call, I happened to look out toward the coast where the lighthouse is, and noticed there were absolutely no lights on.  Normally the entire building is lit up, along with several marinas just below, and numerous houses.  Like I said, this is only about a 20-minute drive away, so over the water you can see pretty clear. 

I shook it off, obviously there must have been a localized power outage.  The next few weeks, all normal lights were operating.  Until another random day, complete darkness.  I thought this was too weird to happen twice within a month.  I asked one of the guys that worked there much longer than me if he’s experienced anything like that.  He seemed oddly dismissive of it.  All he said was “Jake might have known,” and moved on to his routine patrol.  Now Jake, probably short for Jacob, was the epitome of an” old timer.”  I didn’t see him much, because we worked complete opposite shifts and leave days.  I made it a point to come in early one day and found Jake in the Officer’s kitchen area.  I asked him about the lights.  Jake, adding to the mystery, put his coffee cup in the sink, looked at me and nodded his head ‘no.’  And.. that was it!  He walked out and despite my attempts to ask again, he completely ignored me.  Maybe that’s why no one talks to the guy or has anything to say about him really.

 

Now more confused than ever, I found that first cop I talked to later on that shift.  I quickly told him the short interaction I had.  His face froze.  I could see his brain trying to compute. 

“Jake.. is dead,” he said, seeming now to be just as confused as I am. 

He continued.  “I know you’re newer here, but he’s been gone for a long time.  He used to live in that tower you asked me about.  No one ever knew for sure.  It was reported as an accidental.  But the way he was talking back in the day, talking about lights, and water, and.. well, I don’t think Jacob ended peacefully, or by anyone’s own hands but his own.  That was no accident.”",1,1742846090.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

How can I make it less uncomfortable?,"I don't know if this is the appropriate sub for this question but i need some advice.

English is not my first language so sorry about some mistakes

So I(22M) have an ex(23F), we dated for a year and a half in high school, and we broke up at the end of the senior year over 5 years ago. We talked a lot during the breakup and were on good terms, but had no contact until last week, when she messaged me on Instagram at 4 AM asking if I still lived in my hometown (which I do). She then said she’d like to talk, but it would have to be in person when she comes back here (for context, I’ve been in a relationship for 3 years, and my girlfriend knows about this conversation and actually encouraged me to meet up). So we agreed to meet for coffee.

Up to this point, everything seemed a bit random and strange, but nothing felt too serious just an ex wanting to talk about life. Until yesterday.

Encouraged by my girlfriend and some friends, I decided to ask what she wanted to talk about. She said it wasn’t anything important, just talking about the changes in her life and the ones she’d heard about in mine (all normal up to this point). Then, after a few minutes, she confessed that she was becoming an alcoholic, and the day she messaged me, some bad things had happened (which she didn’t specify) and that’s what motivated her to reach out. She also said that with other people, she could express herself sober, but with me, it would be different and that the conversation would have to involve alcohol, which contradicts everything she had said so far about this just being a simple chat about life changes. She said all of this in a very confusing way, and I still didn’t fully understand the conversation even after rereading it a few times.

As I mentioned earlier, we broke up amicably, and I wouldn’t mind seeing her and talking, but this last talk left me feeling anxious and slightly uncomfortable, making me question if this meeting would be good for both of us.

tl;dr: My ex, who I haven't talked to in years, reached out to meet up. She confessed she's becoming an alcoholic and wants to talk to me, which made me feel anxious. Now I'm unsure if meeting is a good idea.

[Mandy Patinkin is more Spanish than \\""Hilaria\\"" Baldwin.](https://preview.redd.it/5xf102y6noqe1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=7293f5021d1fad7ab98f2f9cb36d1167ff4e8a9a)

Apparently, Hillary thinks code switching means launching into a double time Sofia Vergara impersonation when talking to her monolingual spouse, her monolingual interior designer, her monolingual “therapist,” and the monolingual producers of the TLC show. A master class in stupid is as stupid does

**On with the recap!**

**“Home From Camp” is the opening caption and it appears Operation Scrape the Bottom of the Barrel has been launched**

* Alec drives the kids home from camp and I’m already annoyed. The bar is low, but that was quick. Hillary is wearing her shiny leggings and somehow they’re even more annoying in real time than in pictures.

[\\""The smell of absurdity in the morning\\"" - Tom Robbins](https://preview.redd.it/co0el9fknoqe1.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b3a6421e01bf356449c96b6fbbc6593cdb4e131)

* Hilz carries assorted kids out of the car while Alec says jovially to one of them, *“where you goin, butt crack?”* while her voice over says *“Alec and I are rarely apart.”* In my humble opinion, they should part ways while he goes to parenting classes, and she gets psychotherapy from anyone besides the guy that agreed to play their therapist for the show.
* As Hillary carries Marilú out of the car (the child has shoes on, so I don’t know why this is a thing), ML says *“Daddy make me sad”* Hilz asks why and the she responds *“Um, um, um I don’t like him because he’s being neelo.”* Leo sweetly kisses his sister on the cheek and Hillary ignores that as she tries to figure out what *“neelo”* could be. That she might be searching for the word *“malo”* (bad) doesn’t occur to Hillary’s [multi fluid](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1g0y0rt/when_hilaria_decided_she_wasnt_spanish_she_was/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) brain.
* Alec comes over and Marilú straight gives him a hearty raspberry. Same, little one. Alec explains ML is mad because she had to sit in the back during the drive home.
* Cut to Hillary off camera interviewing Edu and Marilú and asking, *“what’s your favorite thing about Daddy?”* Marilú calmly responds *“Poo poo. Poo poo worms*.*”*
* During a couch interview with both Alec & Hillary the producer asks how they deal with kid meltdowns and Alec prompts Hilz *“please answer the question”* sounding exasperated.
* Couch Hillary*: “You don’t take it personally, they’re gonna yell. They’re gonna yell sometimes, oh my God, we have seven kids, surprise, they’re gonna yell, get over it.”*

[Somebody needs to get over something but for once, it's not Alec.](https://preview.redd.it/7is1q8donoqe1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=050faa2a89b13ce58a28a02d1192679c9665a199)

* Couch Alec: *“What I’ve learned from myself and other people is that children melting down is better than the opposite”* (camera cuts to cat meowing and Alec glancing over at it) *“When a kid keeps everything inside and is in a corner and is grinding his teeth* (Hillary looks at him sharply) *or her teeth and is just really, really far away. I’d rather have them screaming at me for an hour a couple times a week maybe”* (we see a montage of the kids screaming in various setting: cars, horse stables, houses, you name it) *“or less, maybe less.”*
* Alec uses Hillary’s accent in talking to Marilú: *“ju call me neelo? Ju know wha I say to ju, I say (blows a raspberry) I say neelo!”* At the same time Hilz is in full accent *“why ju mad at heem?”* Any speech therapists in the house? Sweet ML does not have a fighting chance with these two.

**Hillary Cooks or Let’s Talk At Length About Alec Seeing Hillary’s Ex-Boyfriend Naked**

* Alec says, *“I want to prove that I have actually have friends that are adult men who have careers and are intelligent people, it’s not all just scraping gum off my rug all day long”* so we are introduced to “Brendan, Artist” and “Dan, Documentary Filmmaker” standing awkwardly in the kitchen as Hilz cooks. One asks stiffly, *“What are you cooking, Hilaria?”*
* In the style of popular aspirational lifestyle shows Hilz answers airily: *“I don’t even know yet, I’m just gonna make things…we have a whole beautiful garden that I just went to”* as she digs through a basket of veggies.

[The four candles amidst the clutter are especially perplexing to me.](https://preview.redd.it/ldz81uauooqe1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d73b761e90b08a0d4221a7e4be3f3d4f56ef201)

* More of a little segment I like to call Revisionist History with Hillary where she simpers in a couch interview: *“I love having a full house. I always grew up with a very big full house”* (she is one of two children born to [a busy doctor and a busy lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/10pmiip/here_is_what_i_dont_get_her_parents_are_very/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). *“I think it’s one of the reasons I had so any kids and what I love even more is when the house is even fuller.”*  No typos, just unvarnished Hillary Lynn.
* Couch Hillary: *“When you go to therapy it’s about self-awareness, it’s about release. I see him with his friends. I think this is going to be a big part of our healing journey is to grow and walk forward with the people who stood with us the entire time.”*
* The friends were there when Alec and Hillary met and of course they’ve been coached to brings this up, asking Alec *“do you remember what we were doing right before you met her?”*
* **Hillary pipes up from the kitchen:** ***“are you talking about when we’re meet?”*** **English, guys. It’s so tricky with all that pesky grammar and syntax.**
* Couch Alec: *“When I met my wife, oh my God, it was just magical”* and we get a black and white title card like silent movies. At this point I paused and poured myself the biggest glass of hard cider and reconsidered my life choices.

* We get flashbacks of Alec telling Carmen the story of when he met Hillary while Carmen gave him a facial and Hillary telling Carmen the story as they played with the sad anniversary gifts that she ultimately gave Alec. The planning that went into this is evident.
* Alec clearly says, *“I was with my friend Brandon.”* The man’s name is Brendan but do tell, Peepaw.
* In Hillary’s story she tells Carmen the girlfriend she was with that night hit her and said, *“Alec Baldwin is looking at you!”* Carmen asks, *“Did you even know who Alec Baldwin was?""*
* Hillary: *“I had seen Working Girl a few times because Yiayia really liked Working Girl.”* I think [the Greek Yiayia](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/yjr9oa/of_hbs_5989_ig_posts_only_17_are_pics_with_female/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in question might have been one of Hilly’s childhood nannies as well as Carmen’s OG nanny cuz ain’t no way Dr. Kathryn has Carmen call her Yiayia.
* Hillary tells her 10-year-old *“I winked at him and that’s like the cringiest thing you could do but I was at least one glass of wine in.”* She describes that as she was leaving, he grabbed her hand and said *“who are you? I must know you. And I thought well at least now he’s being cringey too because that like a really bad line.”*

[Speaking of cringe - they provided this picture to be used in the show.](https://preview.redd.it/0cct3vh9poqe1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1877f7c026c9aafed27253645783fe98b43f85c)

* Meanwhile, back at the kitchen table, Alec is telling his bosom buddy whose name he doesn’t quite get right *“and it was magical, look at us now.”*
* **Hearing this, Hillary yells out: “*****Then you said where are you from, and I said I’m from Boston, and you’re like no you’re not and I was like actually I am, and it was like an omen of what was to come!”*** **She opens her eyes wide and throws a paper towel at him and when I tell you the man looked thoroughly befuddled. He must have been thinking “this shitty adlib was not in the script!”**

* Hillary trots out her story about being used to splitting checks for dinner and Alec notes: *“She used to date age-appropriate guys. When I met her, she was very young, so they were very young. And I’d meet them, and I’d be like I get it y’know they’re very handsome and very super fit guys who were about as interesting as watching the grass grow.”*  As compared to the scintillating metal powerhouse that is Hillary?
* Couch Hillary joking (?) to Couch Alec: *“I wanted to have my kids, and I wanted them to look good… I wanted to have a baby with a good-looking guy. It could have been anybody You were just the first good looking guy that walked up to me, so I was like ok he’ll do.”*
* Couch Alec: (smiling) *“I was the first good looking guy?”* Their dynamic is so off all the time.

* Hillary: *“No”* (zany music starts playing because she so funny, gaiss) *“Well, I wouldn’t date an actor when he was an actor”* (the fuck?). *“I dated an actor who got to be on Broadway, and we went to go see him naked.”* She tries so hard to be clever. Girl, just eat your kale. 
* Hillary & Alec duo/Couch Alec: *“I’ve seen the, one of the loves of her life naked!”* Hillary is pretzeled up on the couch with her arms wrapped around her legs, showcasing her ring and flipping her hair around and laughing so hard I was a little concerned she’d cannonball right off the couch.
* Hilz giggle whispers *“he was not the love of my life.”* I’m sure [Eduardo Ramos](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/10xcu8n/in_2010_after_hillary_became_hilaria_and_started/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) agrees and thanks his lucky stars.

* Couch Alec: “*And when you meet him backstage, we go out to the lobby, and we meet em all* (where?) *and her boyfriend comes I’m like, hey how you doin, you fuckin asshole (bleeped out)?”*
* Couch Hillary: *“And I was like, I’m going to stay over here”* (does a robot voice and robot arms)
* Couch Alec: *“And you can’t pay attention to a word he’s saying. He’s standing right here taking to me. I’m sitting there looking, I’m goin, and he’s lookin at me goin yeah y’know the show and this and that”* (does a bit of an impression that Hillary finds hysterical) *and I’m like you have, like a baseball bat that you stuff into your pants every day. How does that work for you? Well, let’s move on from that subject.”*
* Producer: (laughing hysterically) *“That wasn’t on my list of questions!”* Uh huh.
* Couch Alec: *“I thought it had to be told, it had to be told.”*  Did it, though?

**Taking 7 Kids to the Dentist**

* They’re back in NYC for a day as Hillary yip yaps about going to into city to do some back-to-school prep and we see her walking with the kids.
* The really interesting part here is the captain describing the tall, thin young man with her who I always thought was Alec’s PA. **He is officially recognized nanny number three, y’all, and his name is Eduardo!** 

[Why is Hillary pushing the double stroller while wearing No H? What. Does. The Nanny. Do?](https://preview.redd.it/6373tdbcqoqe1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef85eb8549c98042a22e15e9405415918597b108)

* As they walk, Hilz is speaking is Spanish briefly which short circuits her English so we hear her say *“más tarde”* (later) then when Carmen asks if they can get candy she says *“gwee cahn’t get shoogar as we’re going to the denteest!”*
* **Couch Alec says raising kids in the city is difficult and expensive but then says proudly** ***“I always look at my kids’ birth certificates and it says born in Manhattan. All my kids are born in New York, they are New Yorkers.”***

* **Couch Alec: (looking flummoxed)** ***“She’s born in LA which is pretty much the same the same”*** **I beg your finest pardon? Whaaaaaat?**

   * **Mother of the Year:** ***“Estop saying bad words!”***
   * **Baby Ilaria:** ***“Bitch (bleeped)”***
   * **Hillary:** ***“It’s amazing about babies they will repeat everything you don’t want them to…”***
   * **From her stroller, Marilu sucker punches poor Rafa who looks shocked as Hillary stops walking and says unconvincingly** ***“Lulu, no.”***
* They finally arrive at the dentist and while processing my trauma from all of the above, I have so many logistical questions. Hillary is not exactly what I would call a busy person. Why not make three appointments (2 big kids, 2 big kids, 3 youngest) on three different days since she has three nannies to help? Why not make seven different appointments and have some peace? Why are they holding Baby Ila down in the exam chair and heightening her fear? Is the balloon guy there for non-celebrity clients as well?
* Hillary explains that sometimes when she gets overwhelmed by the chaos of all the yelling, she tunes them out and just looks around and blinks. Confusingly, she also says, “*I enjoy this chaos so much that I don’t want to be mad at it while it’s happening.”* Pick a lane, loony tune.
* **The dental tech asks Rafa if he’s brushing his teeth twice a day and he says,** ***“I don’t know because I have very yellow teeth, I have yellow stains.”***  **Cut to a solo interview with Parent #3/Carmen who shares,** ***“Rafa went through a phase where he did not brush his teeth. So now what I do is I scrub his teeth once a week and I do the high smile like fluoride treatments with like the charcoal purple thing. He still has yellow teeth, it’s really bad.”*** **Cut to Hillary looking at Rafa’s teeth post check-up:** ***“they look great, they look beautiful.”*** **This little guy breaks my heart. He doesn’t say much when cameras are around, he’s super subdued compared to his siblings, but he sees a lot.**
* The awesome dental assistant who worked with Carmen then chats with her as she works on Leo. She asks Carmen *“what did we learn today”* and they chat about plaque and gingivitis. Leo asks for a break to share *“I learned that Carmen is a* *young* (gets bleeped no subtitles so it must be bad) *who likes to make me embarrassed.”* Carmen didn't bat an eye. The assistant gasps and says, *“no - those are not nice words, Leo!”*  No Hilz to be found but honestly, what would she add if she was there?
* Hillary asks the kids to say thank you to the dentists and staff and not one of them does.
* Alec and Carmen give a couch interview with Carmen curled up on the couch next to him exactly like Hillary in a white tank top with her black bra straps hanging out with full makeup. Alec explains it was hard for Carmen to be an only child for a little over a year then have four brothers in quick succession. Carmen gets airtime trying very hard to be funny and wishing her brothers were cousins who lived in Canada that she saw occasionally (but her sisters could stay). She's snippy and rude to her dad and talks dismissively about her siblings. It’s uncomfortable to watch Alec fail so epically as a parent.
* Back to Alec who stayed in the Hamptons to clean because OCD. As he hoses something down, he chants *“always be cleaning”* \- totally spontaneous moment, obvs. He tells the producer he was in tears prior to the interview over their dirty rugs. Sure, Jan.

[Liking order is not necessarily a compulsion, Zander.](https://preview.redd.it/w10423vvroqe1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=c54030054434ebe5fde89af48c82c708b4f52d80)

 **Caroline Rhea**

* In the peace of no Hilz and no kids, Caroline Rhea stops by the Hamptons house for lunch. They do a bit of improv about how attractive the camera crew are.

[What was that about dating age-appropriate folks? ](https://preview.redd.it/70zrlp8tsoqe1.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60bea0cb50204c16c61169060d8b3d5eccc49d8)

* I’m convinced that this woman has sold her soul to the Baldwins – she spends an inordinate amount of time kissing up to Peepaw and Hilly. She gladly participates in many of their thirsty endeavors:
   * Alec’s 2019 Comedy Central roast: *“One time I was doing Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and he was doing Hilaria, the teenage yoga instructor. Your wife Hilaria is in great shape but who wouldn’t be after pushing around a 200-pound baby all day? She’s the boss, baby!”*
   * Alec’s stint on “Match Game” (2/23/19)
   * Alec’s “Here’s the Thing” Podcast “Everybody Loves Caroline Rhea” (4/3/23)
   * Hillary and Mich Who’s “Witches Anonymous” Podcast “In the Coven with Caroline Rhea” (12/4/22). Here’s an [excerpt from my recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/zdk7y6/witches_anonymous_ep_5_recap_in_the_coven_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of that insanity: Caroline is all in on this crazy train and actually says these words (brace yourselves), ***“Look externally for support, but know, like, Hill-airy-uh, you’ve accomplished more in your life than most humans…you have 7 children, you’re an amazing mother, you’re an amazing, supportive, loving wife, you’re out there, you’re always saying the right thing. You’re always supporting women; you’re always fighting back from bullies. Give yourself a break, you’re too hard on yourself.”*** Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the wee donkey. This. Is. Sheer. Insanity.
* All that to say, if Caroline is ride or die for these two dullards, it speaks volumes about her. 

 **Grandma Hillary**

* Hilz says that while she was in the city with the kids, Ireland, her baby, and her husband (did we know they’re married?) *“happened to be in town,”* so they meet up at the conveniently empty Emporio restaurant owned by her BFFs David and Markus which gets lots hype. Hillary wears a tiny black slip dress that was tasked with doing too much with too little fabric.

[Cleavage rocks, but Hillary's aggressive cleavage is creepy.](https://preview.redd.it/t98kxaqxsoqe1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=e045b13d7262810097352de8fbe3d2b3859edfa1)

* In a voice over while pictures of Ireland growing up are shown, Hillary reads stiffly: *“Ireland is Alec’s only child from his first marriage to Kim Basinger. She grew up in LA but moved to Oregon a few years ago and started a family.”* How can she be bad at reading two sentences? 
* Hillary, Ireland, André, and Baby Holland sit in the empty restaurant and have the most awkward exchange. The first thing we hear Ireland say is that she can’t believe the Baby Ilaria (pronounced Eee-lar- ee-uh) is the same height as Holland who is 9 months younger.
* Hilz reminds viewers that she loves Ireland, and they have a lot in common because Hillary is only 11 years older than her stepdaughter: *“We were pregnant at the same time”* i.e., don’t forget she’s as fertile as a woman in her late 20s.
* Hillary “code switches” with Holland as she gets a little fussy and tells her in full faux accent: *“Ees ok, since I’m your, like, granma, ees gonna be ok.”* Nothing about this is ok.
* We learn that this is the first time that Hillary has met Holland in person because *“we live so far”* (Portland to NYC is 4 hours, 43 minutes). Hillary describes Holland getting to meet Hillary and Alec’s kids that same morning and we see pictures and videos of the meet up.
* We hear virtually nothing from André (who is ten years older than Ireland but doesn’t look it), and Ireland is stiff and not particularly personable (she wasn’t pregnant at the time as some have speculated). They don’t look at ease in front of the cameras, which is fair – most of us would feel a little awkward being filmed in an empty restaurant with our inappropriately dressed stepmother/mother-in-law wearing what looks like lingerie. To me this indicates that they were willing to be on the show just to support Alec.
* As she has many times before, Santa Hilaria de las Muchas Mentiras tells the story of how she told Alec while they were dating that she wouldn’t stay with him if Ireland didn’t accept her because she didn’t want to come between them.

[The fan in her hand makes me irrationally angry. Hold a butter churn or some shit to show your true roots!](https://preview.redd.it/t8q7zyhftoqe1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd4a600f5fd53c754c0624e0afe613890dc88bc8)

* Couch Alec tells his tale of woe about the terrible divorce and Hillary is the only one who says the name *“Kim”* whereas Alec can only bring himself to say, *“Ireland’s mother.”*
* Very weird switch back to Alec and Caroline having lunch and talking about Ireland. Caroline asks, *“how about your gorgeous little granddaughter?”* He grunts *“cute”* while shoveling in the chicken salad then adds *“Ireland is happy, he’s a great guy, the baby is just perfect.”* 
* **Caroline keeps Alec indebted to her by gamely setting up a disastrous bit:**
   * **Caroline:** ***“I was gonna ask, did you ever have the conversation before you got married like, I want to have all the children in the world or just thought, I’m gonna have three?”***
   * **Alec:** ***“My wife, really, she’s tough”*** **Wut.**
   * **Caroline: (enthusiastically)** ***“She is so on it and capable I admire her with every fiber of my being! I have one child and when I get it all right just once I’m impressed.”*** **Huh.**
   * **Alec: (doing a good DeNiro impression as Caroline giggles)** ***“It’s good. Sounds good, sounds good.”***  **Twilight Zone time.**
   * **Caroline:** ***“DeNiro is on a boat in Italy, I know this because I talked to Whoopie.”*** **Did the editor fall asleep while cutting this? None of this makes sense.**
   * **Caroline:** ***“What’s you next acting move?”***
   * **Alec:** ***“Me? Ummm. Ummmm.”***
* Producer to Caroline: *“Alec has told us that he doesn’t care if he acts any more. Do you believe him?”*
* Caroline: *“No! He’s gonna keep acting. You know what, it’s defense. He’s gone through like a - hell. He’s gonna act again, of course he is. He’s a brilliant actor. That’s your purpose. That’s one of your many purposes: act and then father every child on the planet. Those are your two things that you were born to do.”*

**Back to the Emporio Commercial**

* Hillary calls Alec whom Baby Holland is encouraged to call Peepaw, and we learn that Kim is Meemaw, which she hates. They Facetime with Alec who asks where they are so that Hilz can breezily say that they’re at Emporio.

[The coat fighting for its life will always be funny to me.](https://preview.redd.it/lbknj7xptoqe1.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecdc957bc68acacb82b75af628a6be8ff7de572e)

* Couch Alec shares that his relationship with Ireland was so negatively impacted by his divorce from Kim, he is very focused on having a good relationship with his younger kids.
* Phone Peepaw tells Baby Holland, who is tossing bread around: *“You’re exactly like your mother. We would go to Edo Sushi on Ventura Boulevard and Ireland Baldwin would throw like ten pounds of rice on the floor.”*
* Ireland to Hillary: *“He has to say my last name like that.”*
* Hillary to Alec: *“Why do you always say both names? Like not to be confused with the other Irelands we all know?”* I can’t begin to convey the clarity of her Mainstream U.S. English as she said this.
* Phone Alec: *“Ireland, your hair looks great!”* She does have great hair, unlike Granny Colonial Wig.

[This is like a Renaissance painting. So many ways to interpret the layers happening here.](https://preview.redd.it/m9clu6gvtoqe1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=d989e93f633a2a811d468d13ebfda64cf5a0785d)

* Producer to Alec: *“What’s your relationship with Ireland today?”*
* Couch Alec (with Hilz there): *“Ireland has got a great situation, she’s got a great guy, we love him. Her baby is gorgeous and funny and fit right in with our kids, she’s one of us.”*  That deflection was working overtime! 
* **Phone Alec says,** ***“I love you baby girl”*** **and everybody at the table looks surprised – I wasn’t sure if he was talking to Ireland or Holland. He goes on:** ***“I hate that you’re having my favorite food without me”*** **(so many plugs for this silly restaurant)**.
* **Hillary revs up her bitch bus and throws Alec neatly under it when she says crisply:** ***“well that was your choice to be there, ok?”***  **Dayum. Cut to Couch Alec saying,** ***“we do the best we can and the real glue there is Hilaria.”***  **It might to time to do a little glue quality control, sir.**
* Hillary reminisces that when she and Alec started dating, he took Ireland to a high school volleyball tournament in Florida, and he sent Hillary pictures saying how proud he was of Ireland. Hillary says, *“he worshipped you, still does.”*
* Ireland responds: *“He actually got asked to leave my game because he told a ref off so bad…the ref was…borderline abusive to the girls so that was one time I was like, that’s awesome!*”
* Hillary: *“When he gets upset about something he usually has a point, he just doesn’t convey it”*
* Ireland: *“It’s like a toddler in Target getting dragged out by their mom because they have big feelings.”* Totally except he’s a grown ass man with a [history of misogynistic, racist](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/17b271l/alec_baldwin_is_an_unrepentant_bully_racist_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and [homophobic](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/o0nic7/comment/j5mawii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) rants when he loses his temper. But otherwise, yes, he has big feelings.
* They toast and we see one final shot of frickin Emporio.

**Another Drive in the Hamptons**

* Alec and Hillary drive to the beach and Hillary wants to focus on their marriage *“to reconnect on a different level that is not fight or flight.”*
* After parking she asks Alec: *“would you like to go on a nice beach walk with me?”* He responds with a breathy *“sure”* maybe imitating her crazy voice as she rolls her eyes.
* Alec talks with a lot of emotion about how happy Hillary was when he met her and how women with cancer would take her yoga class and say how good they felt taking her class. He actually says, *“I died when that woman said that, I died.”*  Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Fund, anyone?
* He claims he didn’t kiss her for their first month of dating bc he was doubting whether he wanted to pull her into his world. 
* Alec engages in ""OCD beach cleanup"" and Hillary just stands and stares instead of helping. It’s just as well because if she were to bend down her enormous fake breasts would cause her to faceplant in the sand.

[Imagine not finding anything your partner says even remotely interesting. ](https://preview.redd.it/2eenn405voqe1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e771b53fa788e53947502d179816dd24c18c16e)

*  When he picks up an abandoned sock she whines, *“this is why you’re gross Alec, because then you want to touch \[the trash\], you’re supposed to do this with gloves on. I hope that person’s sock doesn’t have warts on his feet”* (not a typo).
* Alec talks about the history of Long Island and Hillary could not possibly care less. She says in a couch interview that she’s heard most of his stories and just stops listening. To his credit, Alec is aware and says, *“my wife tunes out, deeper than I thought possible.”*  
* Hillary tells Alec that she remembers the first time he took her to this beach, during Easter of 2011 and even then he was telling her about the history of the place and drawing maps in the sand, then she reads his downcast face for once and saves the moment by saying, *“You were fascinating and I decided to get married to you.”*  All lies but E for effort. 

[Little did 2011 Hillary know that 2025 Hillary would have a full factory reset.](https://preview.redd.it/ymb18z8hvoqe1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc95adc13e3c2f94f067f13c60815685ebb36b2)

*  Couch Alec: *“It’s been very, very tough for her. Everything that supported me and helped me was muted and everything that hurt me and cost me was amplified by the media. She’s married to this. And I for a while this past year fully expected her to sit down with me and say I don’t think I can do this anymore. I fully expected her to present me with that idea. It was what a lot of other people have done… I would have understood kind of, because I don’t want her to suffer because of me. But Hilaria wasn’t willing to do that.”*
* Couch Hillary says: *“the most romantic thing you can do with somebody is just be and enjoy each other. We go on a walk and he’s gonna talk about the geography of the land and the trash that history of this and that. And he always says to me, you’re gonna miss me when I’m gone because nobody’s gonna be doing this. And I’m like, you’re probably right”* (laughs and tosses her hair).
* Of course we get the girlfriend narrative from Hilz: *“Alec said to me, just remember you’re always gonna be my girlfriend even if you are mother and wife, you’re always my girlfriend.”*
* Cut to Alec on the beach: *“Do you want to go clamming? If I looked like you, I wouldn’t want to go clamming either. Do you want to go to dinner with me? God, you look so good in that bathing suit, I love that bathing suit.”*  
* Couch Hilz again: *“Of course I want my husband to think I’m attractive and funny and want to spend time with me, of course I want to be his girlfriend. My husband wants to date me, is this that bad? How do you think we have so many kids?”* She smirks and thank the pepino gods this is over because I can’t take another minute. 
* As our friend the lovely dental assistant said, *“what have we learned today?”* I would say that watching smug, willfully ignorant liars spin for an hour is exhausting.

I get it, everyone's looking for something different. But this one guy has me so irritated right now. He's exactly my type physically, and he's also the same flavor of nerd that I am. It seems on paper like we have overlapping interests. Over the last couple months he has initiated by showing interest in me on 2 separate apps. I'm in my early thirties and he's in his late twenties, for reference.

1st time he woofed me on Scruff. I messaged him asking him about a hobby that we share. More than just ""hey, how's it going?"" No response from him. That's fine, it's scruff. I don't expect much from it either way.

2nd and most recent time he liked my photo on Hinge. I recognized him and checked out his profile, and it looks like we have some other interests in common so I say hey and ask him about those things. Again, no response. And now I'm frustrated because his profile says he's looking for something serious and wants to date people and not just waste time on the apps.

I get that I'm not entitled to his attention, or a response from him. I also get that this is how the apps are most of the time. But damn, why are you hitting me up to just not engage with me at all? It's one thing if I message a guy and don't get a response back. Fine, whatever, I'm just not what he's looking for. That's totally chill. But the fact that he's the one who initiated, and he's just my type, but he doesn't respond beyond that is infuriating to me. 

I know I should just leave it, but I have half a mind to call him out. If you're actually interested in me then let's grab a coffee, go on a date, something!

1jizrjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1jizrjw/my_sister_bullying_our_mother/,My sister bullying our mother,"
My older sister (ES, 45) is  making my mother's (67) life a living hell.

I moved out of the house when I was 18. I couldn't deal with ES's bullying anymore. She made my childhood miserable. 
Eg; burning all my books and clothes, belittling my grades, looks, hair, friends, ambition, dreams, food, likes, dislikes, everything, physically assaulting me with chairs and firewood, cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, gathering firewood and fetching water six to nine times a day. ( We grew up in a remote village) And the verbal abuse was beyond imagination. I am still terrified of her rage. 

So when I finally had a chance to move out, I did. I started working as a dishwasher in a hotel. My mother would call me up and cry because she became my sister's victim but mother told me never to come back.

Life got better after I graduated and got a job. ES still remained jobless, stuck in the village.
But things got worst when she married. We don't know what she told her husband but we know its not good. Her husband resents me and my parents. 
Brother in law (BIL)would come to my parents house ramming the door instead knocking and scream at my parents and the pets. 

When ES got engaged she begged me to be at her wedding. I swore that I won't attend the wedding even if she was marrying a prince, but mother convinced me to attend it since it is the first wedding in the family. 
ES said she will pay my flight tickets and expenses and all I need to do is show up since I am her only sister. I waited and waited but the wedding day was approaching and she never sent me money but she kept talking about her wedding so I removed all my savings and take out a loan for her wedding day, plus take a planned leave from my job to travel to the village to attend the wedding and come back in a week's time. 
When I got there, that night, mother whispered to me that the wedding has been postponed to another 15 days. 
I had to extend my holidays costing me dearly. Too expensive to go back to the city, my job and post pone the holidays, too early for the wedding. 
I was almost fired from my job but because  I had not taken a single planned leave in two years, my manager gave an exception but I lost my yearly bonus that year. 
When I told ES that I  had removed all my savings for her and had taken out a loan to attend her wedding and now, my job is at stake, she screamed at me for making everything about money and that she will pay me back, that I am embarrassing her. She told me to pack up and leave as she doesn't want me at her wedding. We ( mother and I)  simply couldn't pack up and leave at night when she threw us out of her new house. She was moving to a different village after her marriage and we were setting up the house for her. So I had to apologise and request her to let us stay at her house, it was bitterly cold and no blankets or firewood, no neighbours or hotels in the remote village. 

After the wedding, she never called me. I remember standing inside the bus at the airport to take us to the arrival section, when BIL called up to check if I had reached the city safely. That time, Bil was very courteous and kind to all of us. After the call, I decided to cut her off. 
Once in three months, I call her just to say hi. She never calls me.
I am thinking of quitting my job and moving back to my parents and do something that I love.(Bee keeping and nursery )or have a quiet life. I am tired of the city and a demanding job.

Now, as much as I want to, I am terrified that ES will take advantage of me. She has the ability to make me do the things that I don't want to do by making me do it as if I am doing her a big favour. Cleaning her toes nail, applying lipstick for her, cleaning her toilet, visiting her in-laws and washing their dishes, inviting her in laws and making me cook for the entire clan. One time I had to cook for twenty-eight people. 
 
On her wedding day, while they were doing her make up in the hotel, she said my presence in the room is triggering her and asked me to stop looking in the mirror while we were doing the make up. She got more agitated because the mirror reflected everything in the room. Even after I stopped looking at it, when I move around she could see me through the mirror. 
The makeup artist saw the tension and asked me if I could step out for a coffee or something as the bride is jittery. 

ES claims that she might be a physical bully but I am a mental bully who never let go of the past and always think the worst of her, that I always play the victim and that it's my fault that she didn't get the Job that she always wanted because I fought with her and ruined her mood. 

One day , years ago, I had stopped talking to ES for a full year. I remember that afternoon, a friend of mine and I were sitting in the balcony , talking , when ES called up and started screeching over the phone. I put the call on speaker and told my friend, see how my sister talks to me. My friend was shocked listening to the words spewing out of the phone, she told me to hang up and not listen to it because it will effect my psyche. I hung up the call and blocked her. Months later when I opened my blocked list, I saw the messages;  go ahead and sleep with all the men in the city, you whore, I'm sure you want to because all your friends does it.
 It had messages after messages so I deleted all of them without reading. 

If I go to the village to start something, she would expect me to leave everything and be at her back and call. Especially babysit her kids. 

Mother is illiterate so there is nothing much she can do but ES keeps on bullying her every day. She still says it's mothers fault that I wouldnt talk to her or build the relationship with her because mother keeps spewing gossip about her to me, that our main motive in life is to group together and exclude her, and not even give her an inch of respect because she chose to be a SAHM. 

BIL 's favourite thing to do is visit our parents house and tell them that they have failed as parents. 
Frankly, I never blame my parents. The are illiterate farmers so they did the best they could. 
But now, if I were to retire I would have to go back to the place where I had escaped, would it be even worth it?
ES does not have an ounce of empathy in her bones and whoever comes in contact with her goes through a very difficult period in their lives. 

She also made sure that our parents are heavily alienated by telling nasty things about them to the relatives. Now, none of the relatives would visit our parents and all they do is call up my mother and accuse them  of playing favourites. 

I simply want to quit my job and start something new. It's been years since I lived with my parents and now that they are growing old, I want to be with them. I have no plans of getting married and ES said she is super embarrassed to be my sister as I am a full time spinster. ",2,1742845233.0,family,1,1.0,False

Trying to get my blood sugars in line before I start another med that also raises blood sugars.

A little BG: early 40's. Not overweight(but have lost 3 pounds since starting low carb/sugar). No significant family history of diabetes. I am on a low dose of Metformin (500 mg daily), but I've only been taking it for a month. I workout 3 days or more a week.

I get really confused over what is ""safe"" for me to eat sometimes. Mornings have the worst range. This morning was half a cup of 2% plain Greek Yogurt, half a cup of berries, monkfruit sweetener, Coffee with fat free half and half with Splenda. Blood sugar reading post 2 hours- 180. I've had oatmeal a few time and sometimes it's >150 post 2 hours. A few times it's been over 200, for the same oatmeal/time. I was eating the berries and yogurt with a little honey before, the change to monkfruit made little difference.

I know that if I test closer to 3 hours, I am closer to >140. Everything online is confusing on when to test. 

Berries, plain yogurt and Monkfruit are supposed to be safe from everything I read, so why is my blood sugar so high?",2,1742845203.0,prediabetes,3,1.0,False

Today I woke up to absolute painful silence. No meowing. No bells jingling. No running down the hallway. Just silence.

This morning I typically would’ve opened my bedroom door to find my 11 month old cat Mr. Meatball laying down in front of me in the hallway. I would’ve carefully stepped over him, and he would’ve immediately sprung up and followed me into the living room.

The first thing he’d do is claw at his scratching post in excitement.
The first thing I’d do is open up the blinds and the sliding glass door so he could smell the fresh air. He’d sit there and stare outside for a while as I made my coffee, then he’d realize I wasn’t there and come find me. He’d rub up against my leg, then flop over on his side. I’d lean down to pet his tummy and he’d swat at my hand.

I’d make my way over to my spot on the couch, careful not to step on him because he’d always walk between my legs, and sit down with my coffee. He’d make his way over and join me, usually laying on my chest with his face in mine. His weight always felt like a ton of bricks as he moved around trying to get comfortable. I would get so annoyed with him, and now I miss that feeling more than ever.

Today, I sit alone in my corner of the couch. No coffee, because I don’t have the energy to make it.

This morning I had hoped it was all a bad dream. But it wasn’t. And I have to deal with this reality.

Mr. Meatball, I miss you so much and I’m so sorry that you were alone and in pain when you died. I love you.",5,1742845182.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False
1jizqpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/1jizqpf/some_advice_from_an_italian_living_in_italy_to/,Some advice from an Italian living in Italy to those who want to travel to Italy to avoid scams,"If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:

- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.

- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.
Even in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.

- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like ""Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?"" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.

- Never stop to talk to guys who claim to be ex-drug addicts or ex-convicts who ask you for money and have an improvised stall, often asking for money and signatures to support their association.
It's not true, similar associations never go to the streets to ask for money, those guys are just scammers who want your money.
 
- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.

For taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.
Furthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.

To eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.
Try to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.
If you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.
Above all, always find out if there is a surcharge for table service, since it is an additional charge to the total bill to be paid.
In Italy, there is no tip at all, so if you want to give one, it is only your free choice but no one will ever be able to ask you for it. 

To visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double. 

For now this is all that comes to mind, for any other questions or doubts I remain at your disposal.",48,1742845175.0,TravelHacks,5,0.96,False

My girlfriend and I were in a relationship for over a year, and everything seemed perfect. We didn’t fight, had lots of intimacy, met up nearly every day (320 out of 365), and shared a lot of love. She even proposed to me first. We supported each other, even cracked Group A government exams together. I’d teach her, make her coffee, bring her chocolates during her periods, and pamper her with special gifts and surprises on occasions. She’d also bring me my favorite snacks and sweets, and we never had issues with insecurities or toxicity.

I’m about to land a Group A or B government job soon, and that’s when she left me out of nowhere. I was about to ask her about our future, but all those dreams seem shattered now. Around 20 days ago, she told me she doesn’t feel the same anymore. She said, “I don’t want this anymore.”

I’m not blaming girls in general, but it just hurts. How can someone do this when the other person is putting in so much effort? Do girls ever sit and think, “This person is putting in so much effort, maybe I should give him a chance”?

I genuinely feel bad because it’s taking me a long time to detach myself from her. I’ve been through a lot and I just wish I could feel wanted and loved too. We've talked a few times since—four times from her side, once from mine—one hour talks like, “How are you? What’s going on in life?” She also mentioned she’s on her period, etc. In the end, she tells me to take care, “good night,” and that’s about it.

There’s no other guy, and both of our families are chill. I just want to understand what went wrong. From a girl's point of view, is there any chance we could reconnect? And if so, how do I handle this to maybe help her realize that she was overthinking and it’s not too late?

Anxiety is a beast that often feels impossible to tame. It has a way of creeping in when you least expect it—turning everyday moments into battles and making the simplest tasks feel overwhelming. But here’s the thing: **people do overcome it**. Real people, with real struggles, who once felt hopeless, have found ways to break free. And their stories deserve to be shared.  

I wanted to create a space where we can highlight **real-life examples of individuals who conquered their anxiety**—whether through therapy, lifestyle changes, mindset shifts, or sheer resilience. These are stories of hope that prove anxiety doesn’t have to control your life forever.  

### 💡 **1. Emma’s Story: From Daily Panic to Peace Through Exposure Therapy**  
Emma, a 32-year-old teacher, struggled with **severe social anxiety** for years. She would avoid staff meetings, leave social events early, and even developed **agoraphobia**, fearing she might have a panic attack in public. She was convinced she’d never be able to attend large gatherings again.  

What helped?  
After years of avoiding her triggers, Emma finally tried **exposure therapy**. At first, even walking into a busy coffee shop felt impossible. But she worked with her therapist to **gradually face her fears**—starting with short, planned exposures. Each time she succeeded, her confidence grew. It took months of consistent practice, but eventually, she found herself comfortably attending her best friend’s wedding—a moment she once thought she’d miss due to anxiety.  

✨ *Her key takeaway:* Facing your fears in **small, controlled steps** can rebuild your trust in yourself.

### 🌿 **2. Daniel’s Journey: Beating Health Anxiety with Mindfulness**  
Daniel, 28, developed **health anxiety** after a minor medical scare. He became obsessed with symptoms—googling every sensation, convinced he had a serious illness. His life revolved around **doctor visits and constant self-checks**, which only fed his fear.  

What helped?  
After trying medication and therapy with little success, Daniel turned to **mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)**. He practiced **daily meditation** and learned to observe his thoughts without judgment. Instead of reacting with fear, he allowed the sensations to be present without feeding into catastrophic thoughts. With time, the **intensity of his anxiety decreased**, and he found himself living in the moment again—without the constant health-related fears dominating his mind.  

🌿 *His key takeaway:* **Mindfulness can teach you to stop identifying with anxious thoughts**, giving you space to respond calmly rather than react impulsively.

I've been lurking for the last few weeks or so, and I didn't realize how small and new this group was until today.

I'm 40, from Chicago, and currently spending \~2 months in Mexico City.

I recently got divorced, and since I don't have kids, I figured it was a good time to start traveling.

I'm luckier/more fortunate than most in that I have been working for myself (different businesses started, built, and sold over the years) full time since 2011.

I'm not an influencer, nor do I care to be. And my Spanish is now pretty strong.

That said, this is what I hope to see out of the community, and a few tips that I've picked up over the years in general.

1. I hope that we can see black as something we appreciate, rather than constantly thinking about the ""fight."" Yes. Colorism exists. People look at us differently. Who cares? Find the people that are decent people, and rock with them. No hurt feelings.

2. It's not us versus them. I want to (continue) to learn about how to navigate in a way that locals appreciate. If you don't want to speak the language, learn some words. Tip your doorman or buy him/her a coffee.

We'll all do a lot better if we think of ourselves as citizens of the world rather than having expectations on the place you're in.

3. Don't focus too much on the most popular spots. My best experience so far was 3 weeks in Punta Hermosa, a beach/surfing town about an hour outside of Lima. I accidentally booked the Airbnb there thinking it was far closer than it was. 

Best times ever. Not a party scene, but tranquil, some of the best food I've had ever, and good for the soul.

4. Find a way to make some money that isn't dependent on getting a job where you're at, or something as flimsy as being a travel influencer.  I own a call center and a staffing company. A lot of you could easily do a good job managing Airbnbs in spots popular with English-speakers.

Make American money so you don't have to be subject to the crap of the location you're in. It'll also help you see the bright side in not-so-good spots.

Again, happy to be here, and hopefully this ends up being an uplifting spot for us brothers to be good and better.",2,1742844907.0,BlackPassportBros,1,1.0,False

Mainly practicing at home but every now and then being good enough to use for coffee shop type gigs. I've looked at Roland and the only ones I would consider with the baked in sounds are the most expensive and way out of my budget. 

What I'm wondering are things like reliability, day to day use, convenience features, plug and play realistic sounds vs needing to tinker with everything. 

- I don't mind tinkering but to spend hours and hours to do so I'm not too interested in. Prolly my biggest concern for the strata core. 

- I would mainly play non metal type songs for gigging so those type of sounds aren't necessary to be baked in, if I really need it I'll just go for VSTs for recordings. This is where I see the strata core could be useful with its dynamic baked in options. 

What draws me to the EF note 3 is the ease of use. I just want an experience like an acoustic. Sit down, and play the set. From what I see, ef notes are created mostly for that purpose. I know once I setup the strata core it can be that way but as mentioned, I just don't care for the idea of spending so much time for setup when I can get a ""just works"" option from EF note. I definitely could be over exaggerating what it takes to set up the strata core. 

But this is why I'm here, I would like to hear from folks that have these sets and have used them day to day. Bonus points if you gig with them. 

Also if anyone can post people doing drum covers with these sets, I would love you forever. 😄",1,1742844847.0,edrums,2,1.0,False

1jizj22,https://i.redd.it/bwvzmubzvoqe1.jpeg,Kirkland Brand Espresso 👎🏻,"Hi!

I’m writing this today in regards to the Kirkland brand of coffee beans my girlfriend picked up recently from Costco and to just write about how frustrating this coffee was for us to use. 

We are relatively new to the world of espresso and figured we’d try a different brand and maybe try to save a little bit a money (first mistake). We have a simple DeLonghi machine that’s been wonderful to us so we didn’t think any problems would come up. 

Well, to our surprise we couldn’t even get the machine to pull a shot with these beans. We were racking our brains on what the problem was, we descaled the machine, we cleaned everything multiple times, we were almost to the point of starting to replace some pieces to see if that would work and then we noticed just how oily these beans were. Any common sense person knows oil and water doesn’t mix… so how could a shot even be pulled using this stuff??? Upon some research it was apparent they changed some things around about a year ago at Costco which brought these oily beans to the shelves.

My girlfriend and were quite relieved when we got our usual espresso blend we were using and it worked perfectly. Now time to try and get a refund or maybe a couple hot dogs for our troubles, but just a learned lesson from a couple coffee newbies to avoid this stuff! (If you like it and it works for you all the power to you tho!)",16,1742844665.0,espresso,49,0.81,False

1jizia6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nicotine/comments/1jizia6/heres_your_conclusive_guide_to_seamlessly/,Here's your conclusive guide to seamlessly integrating nicotine into your life and getting the most out of this misunderstood chemical,"As always...  
  
Nothing in this thread is medical advice. Do your own research and always consult a medical professional before making important decisions about your health  
  
Also — this is for people who are already nicotine enjoyers and not for people who don't or have never used nicotine

First of all we need to make some distinctions  
  
Nicotine =/= tobacco  
  
Nicotine is a psychoactive chemical found not only in tobacco but many other plants throughout the plant kingdom  
  
Tomatoes, potatoes, and other plants in the nightshade family all contain trace amounts of nicotine

Nicotine is to tobacco what caffeine is to coffee  
  
Both nicotine and caffeine are technically natural insecticides made by the plant to ward off insects and other pests  
  
What makes them toxic to insects makes them addicting and stimulating to humans

Nicotine was first isolated in 1828 by German chemists Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and Karl Ludwig Reimann  
  
(shoutout to them)  
  
But people have been using tobacco for centuries before that  
  
It was a particular favorite among Native Americans who used the tobacco plant for medicinal/spiritual purposes  
  
Before diving deeper into nicotine as an isolated chemical, we'd like to make a point regarding tobacco:  
  
Smoking anything will always cause some harm  
  
When any material/plant is combusted (set on fire) it creates hundreds of different toxic chemicals that you are then inhaling into your lungs  
  
This includes  
  
\--> Cigars (sorry Andrew Tate fans)  
\--> Cigarettes  
\--> Cigarillos  
  
Smoking puts your body in an inflammatory state, generates free radicals, robs your body of vitamin C/E, causes significant damage to your lungs, and depletes you of collagen  
  
Other issues with tobacco include  
  
\- Mold  
\- Pesticides  
\- Herbicides  
  
So best to get your nicotine fix outside of smoking tobacco products...

In terms of isolated nicotine  
  
There's dozens of options to choose from to obtain your fix  
  
Here's what to look out for when choosing a nicotine product that's right for you:

1/ Artificial sweeteners  
  
Many pouch and gum products use artificial sweeteners such as  
  
→ Sucralose  
→ Aspartame  
→ Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K)  
  
Which have been linked to digestive issues, altered gut microbiomes, and other toxic side effects

2/ pH Adjusters  
  
Most oral nicotine products contain chemicals like sodium carbonate to increase nicotine absorption  
  
The problem?  
  
These chemicals can be highly caustic and damage your oral tissues over time  
  
Not exactly ""clean living"" friendly

3/ Microplastics  
  
Here's something most people don't know:  
  
Many nicotine products contain microplastics as fillers — especially cigarettes, vapes, and even some pouch brands  
  
These tiny particles may cause lots of issues and will only accumulate over time with each use  
  
Other things to look out for in your nicotine products:  
  
\--> Ingredient transparency  
\--> Tobacco-derived nicotine  
\--> Propylene Glycol  
\--> Fillers  
  
Here's the uncomfortable truth:  
  
95% of nicotine products on the market are filled with mystery ingredients, additives, and chemicals.

1jizhmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jizhmd/fight_with_fiance/,Fight with fiance,"⚠️(THIS IS THE FULL STORY AND ITS GOING TO BE VERY LONG BUT I HOPE SOMEONE READS IT BECAUSE I GENUINELY NEED HELP) 

I know it’s a lot but I truly hope someone reads the whole thing I genuinely need help! 

I am going to try and be as candid as possible and not bias to myself! 

My fiance sent me this Reddit thread I will attach what he posted ⬇️
_____________________________________________
{Fight culminated in fiancée pushing me. What do?
Long story short, my fiance and I had planned to get married this spring. We also decided to try to have a child.
She has a child from a previous relationship, I have never been married nor have any children.
The pregnancy was about one month in but rough, she was in a lot of pain due to a medical condition that will require surgery after her child bearing years. This resulted in a lot of attention required on both our parts, her dealing with its effects, me offering support and comfort. Basically a day-to-day thing.
About 5 days ago, we got into an argument regarding medication that I take for an anxiety disorder that l've been on with good success for years. The crux of the argument was that she disagreed with the treatment, although I have had an ongoing relationship with my doctor for years prior to even meeting her. To me, it was an attempt to relitigate something that was old news to me. I saw it as unnecessary.
Long story short, after arguing for three hours and running into a stalemate, I expressed that I wanted to go for a drive to clear my head (this is something that i'll do on occasion).
At this point, she would not let me leave, physically blocking doors and my path throughout the rooms in our apartment.
I saw a little opening and tried to scoot past and she took her right arm and pushed me into the wall to prevent me from leaving. Ok- Now a line has been crossed.
She miscarried the child that night, and obviously emotions have been all over the place. Mine has primarily been anger. We discussed the future and I stated that I want to ensure this was a one-off and wanted to push marr and children discussions to the end of summer.
Her response was that she would get a surrogate and do it herself. I responded that that would be fine, but I would end the relationship. She later said she did not mean this and would never involve me if she did.
I feel detached from every bit of reality l've ever known in my 35 years on this earth. Confused, disoriented, angry, upset, etc.
What do you make of all this?
It's hard to say if the relationship is still worth investing in. If I'm deciding from the experience I've had with her up until this point, undoubtedly yes. If this is some sort of natural progression for her in a relationship, then absolutely not. I refuse to live under a roof where arguments can reach that level.
Whether it's the first scenario or second is tough to make out. She's described violence in her previous relationship with her child's father, which worries me. On the other hand, she has been the opposite to me, so there's more tangible evidence to that side.
We are seeing a therapist on Monday. It's her regular therapist, so I hope there is no bias there.}
_____________________________________________

I just read it and I’m very hurt and honestly I feel the need to defend myself because this is an extremely one sided view coming from someone who was extremely angry withdrawn from medication and looking for retribution and punishment. And if you know both sides maybe we can get a better neutral party opinion. The only thing I do agree with is that some of my actions and reactions were undoubtedly wrong as were his and we need to postpone marriage and having a baby because what I went through is clinically insane! If he is willing to put our personal business on the internet then he’s gonna have to be ok with the full story being out there not just his twisted version! 

I have been going through treatment for a disease that is extremely painful and makes it hard for me to conceive and carry pregnancy I was high risk and prone to miscarriage I was told by my doctor that I may not be able to have children and will soon need all my reproductive organs removed to prevent spreading and cancer, but if I do try and I get pregnant which I did that I have a limited window to do so and the pregnancy will not be able handle extreme amounts of stress as it is very fragile in the early stages. (He knew this and we agreed to approach disagreements with a leveled head to limit stress, which he did not hold up on his end) 

The argument started due to medication issues. He takes an off brand Xanax medication called clonazapam for panic attacks he gets a month supply at a time (his doctor is a long time family friend) and the past few months he has been running out sometimes only a few days sometimes even 1 week before his next refill when he runs out he becomes irritable moody and angry. It has gotten to a point where if he doesn’t have it he freaks out he’s impossible to talk to and not easy to be around I feel like I have to walk on egg shells around him. When he runs out he ends up asking family members for more Xanax. He has gotten them from my mom 2 times she gave him 6 pills from her own prescription his mom 1 time who gave him 2 pills and my aunt who gave him 12 pills. When he asked his mom for more she reluctantly gave them to him and his dad dropped them off he then told my fiance “this is a problem and cannot happen again” when he came inside the house he expressed this to me and how it bothered him. He then proceeded to explain how he’s been under extreme stress since abruptly quitting his job and occasionally has had to take more than prescribed to relieve his anxiety. I also have anxiety and many members of my family do although I refused the offer from my doctor for getting prescribed Xanax for personal reasons I have discussed it at length with my doctor and with my family members who take it so I have a good understanding of the medication he takes. The one he gets is known to cause addiction substance abuse anger neurological dysfunction memory loss cloudy judgement (which I believe is happening, he says and does things then denies them and makes me feel crazy and then proceeds to say I’m the one doing it. It makes me frustrated and question my own reality. He also refuses to believe this is a problem or that he’s acting in such manners) it also causes liver/kidney disfunction if taken regularly for long periods of time which is why they usually aren’t prescribed that way! So when he was telling me how his doctor prescribed it to him and how he was taking it, as his partner and pregnant fiance I reasonably had concerns! I told him what my knowledge on that medication was and asked him if his doctor had discussed that with him as well he said yes I then responded with if it’s not working and he needs to take more maybe speaking to his doctor about a different medication or a higher dose would be beneficial. He said he talks to his doctor monthly and it’s not an issue I said ok I’m not here to judge or tell you not to take it, I saw he was getting up set and I was a bit too I felt like he was kind of talking down to me and treating me like I don’t know about these things, so I moved on but I didn’t want to just shut him out and end the convo because he rarely opens up to me he is very closed off so I said oh that’s nice do you guys just chat or is it like a session we proceeded to talk about therapy I expressed I like it and it’s helpful for me I asked him why he hates it just trying to understand because he was struggling and I felt like maybe talking to his therapist may help. He then turns and sternly tells me I offended him and I don’t understand his anxiety and I have no right to an opinion on his medication because I am uneducated and don’t know what I am talking about. I don’t like confrontation it makes me nervous so I tried to apologize for offending him and explain I was just concerned and wanted to help because it seems like his medication isn’t. We argued for maybe 30 minutes he said he wanted to nap so I sat outside in the car to give him space and clear my head I stayed there for about an hour I came back in and again apologized for offending him I acknowledged his feelings and tried to again explain I was not judging him or questioning his doctor’s capabilities. He said ok I’m going back to sleep can we talk later. I had laundry to do and we don’t have a washer at our apartment so I told him I was gonna run to my parents and do the laundry since I had some free time and he didn’t want to talk. I was gone for a little over two hours while I was finishing up the laundry he texted me “I no longer wish to discuss my medication with you it’s between me and my doctor.” He then told me he was confiding in me which was a mistake and he will never do it again! 

(Mind you when it comes to my anxiety medication he is always overly opinionated Judge and insulting borderline degrading saying things like maybe I need new doctors because my medication doesn’t work and my anxiety is out of control because I like to talk and fix problems as opposed to ignore them isolate and hold resentment in a relationship) 

After I received that text I realized how upset he was and I felt bad for hurting him I am always on his side defending him even when he is wrong 99.9% of the time but I had concerns for his health and wanted to help but I realized him not having his medication for a few days being on edge and angry and just hearing the same thing from his parents it wasn’t the best time to express my concerns. So I replied ok with full intention to respect his wishes in not discussing his medication any further. when I got home I asked him if we can talk I said I don’t want to fight or rehash it I just want to apologize and let you know that offending you was not my intention I was just concerned and wanted to help but I know it wasn’t a good time or necessarily my place to do so in that moment I just cared about him and his well being and wanted to express that. I told him I will drop the subject of his medication completely if that is what he needed. My own personal feelings towards this are; I feel like closing off will only make things worse, I let him know how I felt and I believe if we are a family we can’t safely discuss anything with no judgement, I just wanted to reassure him so that he know he can still talk to me going forward. I don’t feel like I was judging him but I understand why he may have felt that way. But if that’s what he wants to do going forward keeping it private that is his decision and I will respect it. I again expressed how sorry I was and asked how I can make it better. He got very defensive and said “ I told you I don’t want to talk about it you have no right to an opinion on my medication” I told him I’m not talking about the medication just apologizing and letting him know I’m still here and will not judge him. He kept repeating that I know nothing about it and then proceeds to discuss it in detail further after saying that’s what he didn’t want to do! I kept telling him I didn’t want to fight I expressed my concern for the baby but he told me I was “being manipulative and playing the victim and fueling the argument” at this point I was feeling a sharp pain in my stomach and began to become frustrated and defensive because he was the one going in circles about it not letting it go and I was just trying to end it and fix things so that no one felt hurt but at the same time defend myself because I am not a push over and will not allow him to talk down to me continuously. I know I should have been the bigger person and walked away for my health and the babies but he knows how to push my buttons and makes it so difficult. I also don’t like to leave problems unresolved thats never good! 

As the argument goes on I continue to express my concern for my health I told him I was worried about miscarriage and I was feeling lots of pain in my stomach I specifically told him “my stomach feels like it’s being cut open right now the baby can’t handle this stress can we please just agree to disagree and move on” he said “no because you need to understand how wrong you are” then I repeated myself and he said “yea we can agree to disagree I’ve been saying that all night you just won’t drop it” he would repeatedly tell me he was done and didn’t want to talk then say something to try and get me going again and I’m ashamed to say his tactics worked but it did and like an idiot I fell right back into it. 

Following this he tells me he wants to go sleep at his parents and he was taking the car (we only have my car “the family car” right now his is off the road) I told him 1 let’s not worry the family or get them involved we are adults and should be able to solve this and 2 I don’t want to be left alone with no car again reminded him I am in pain and worried about miscarriage, I didn’t want to be stuck with no car and have to call an ambulance with no way to contact him to let him know if that does happen because when he does take off during arguments like that he turns his phone off and won’t respond. He started going off about how I’m being controlling and not letting him leave but I get to leave and take the car when ever I want to which I understand why he felt that way but thy wasn’t the case I wasn’t trying to control him or hold him hostage despite what he wants to believe. We discussed this for a few minutes. At this point I felt like I was already miscarrying (TMI) I felt blood and something protruding down there and a lot of pain and dizziness. After discussion he gets up from his desk grabs his keys and says I’m going for a ride I said again I’m not comfortable being stuck here and if he doesn’t want to be around me I will leave (again when he leaves he leaves for hours at a time and I cannot reach him) I am worried that I may need a doctor I am in pain but he was so frantic storming around the apartment getting his things together I don’t think he even heard me tbh. He stormed into our room to get his coat I followed behind him and stopped in the door way begging him to just stop for a second calm down and listen to me he told me that I don’t dictate what he does and he’s gonna do whatever he wants and that I need to stop being manipulative and playing the victim. I was scared and worried and in pain so I just acted with very poor judgement at this point I just wanted him to stop walking away for one second so that I can tell him that I think I lost the baby. 

He was walking away from me and I was trying to stop him to tell him what was happening. I didn't want him to leave before I can tell him or try to seek medical attention. 

 He was walking straight down the hall I was I front of him he was trying to go into the kitchen to leave so he had to step around me I saw he was going to go around me and I tried to step in front of him before he got to the kitchen but at that point he was already a literal inch from the wall because he was trying to squeeze past me and in the motion of him moving to the side of me and me side stepping to get in front of him he got squished into the wall by my shoulder it was a complete accident and a big mistake on my part I know that my actions in blocking his path were outright wrong and I shouldn’t have done that nor will I do to anyone every again that is never the right way to behave and I know that. There is no justification it’s just what happened. But the fact of the matter is I would never and have never intentionally reached my arm  out to push him into a wall! My arms were full I was holding my iPad, 2 chargers, my monthly pill case which is big, my Apple pen, my pocket book, my Stanley water bottle, my glasses and my phone. As I stepped in front of him I tried to put my hand up as much as I could to just place it on his stomach as I was saying “babe please just slow down for a second” using the same motion someone would at a stop sign when you are waving to signal thank you to a passing car who let you go. I do this all while still clutching my belongings trying not to drop anything. If I actually fully extended my right arm to physically push him into a wall everything I was holding at the time would have fallen. Not to mention I'm 5'0 and 105 lbs he's 6'4 at 250lbs if I tried to push him I would probably fall over! It just makes no logical sense for that to happen or for me to even do that in the first place like why would shoving him into a wall make him stop walking away from me?! I have never displayed any sort of aggression or violence toward him in anyway and he has even admitted that! My full intention was to just get him to slow down and hear me. 

We argued some more about that and other things that he brought up which had nothing to do with the conversation at hand. It seemed to me in that moment he just wanted to argue because he was angry and needed an outlet. He does this frequently during times of stress! We ended the argument after that he told me not to talk to him I grabbed a drink from the fridge I felt like I was gonna pass out and went to go to the bathroom to check on the bleeding and see if it was really a miscarriage (I was in so much denial at this point) but he went in first so I waited a bit but it was taking to long and the pain was getting worse so I knocked on the door and asked him to let me in. I checked and sadly saw my baby outside of my body! My heart broke in that moment I was in complete shock! I called him into the bathroom we cried held eachother made up and was able to be there for eachother and comfort one another. He promised me that we would try again and he wouldn’t give up on me he told me loved me and once I heal we can try for another baby. At the end of it all He was tired he took a melatonin and I was still bleeding in pain I didn’t want to wait to the morning but he was so wiped out and didn’t want to go so drove to the hospital to check on everything and make sure it was ok. I needed the alone time to process anyway. 

When I came home the following morning he was a different person. He repeated the same promises from the night before he even said don’t worry about the argument it meant nothing he was over it and wanted to move on. I was crying and said it was not worth losing our baby and he said he agreed. I was so heartbroken. 

A few days go by he remains comforting and supportive and loving. He then runs out of the medication that his mom gave him and becomes cold again. We drove to my aunts house 25 min away at midnight to get him more. On the way home we both apologized for the previous discussion about his medication and had more understanding towards each others points of view. The convo went great and I felt better. We also discussed trying for another baby and he seemed excited saying it would be “fun”. 

Everything seemed to be fine between us at this point.

Another day goes by and I needed to get out I couldn’t stay in bed any longer so I went for a coffee with my friend (cried the whole time) and then got my eyelashes done and picked up my son on the way home. He seemed supportive of me doing this and told me to do what I needed to feel better. I tried my hardest to put a smile on my face the whole morning but inside I felt like a part of me was broken. When I got home the feelings rushed to the surface again. He seemed annoyed about this and having to comfort me but didn’t say anything yet. 

The next morning he seemed very off I asked him a few times if he was ok he said he was fine. My son wanted to lay in bed with us and play his game so I let him come up. My fiance then rolled over seemingly annoyed and kept looking over his shoulder anytime my son moved even slightly (he was being very quiet and behaved). I realized he was agitated so I told my son to go to the living room and wait for me while I make breakfast and coffee then we can take a ride to target. I felt like I needed to get out and my fiance seemed annoyed and wanted to sleep so I felt like that would be the best thing to do. My son got up and left the room and as I was getting up to follow him my fiance turned around angrily and said with an attitude “you need to give me more space in the bed I can’t sleep you are constantly moving your legs onto my side at night and now I’m tired” we have had this conversation before I’ve apologized for disrupting his sleep and have made attempts to stay to my side of the bed but it’s hard to be aware of what you do when you are not awake. I told him the same thing I did last time and said I’m sorry I acknowledged his feels and told him I would try harder to stay on my side even suggested a pillow boarder. My answer wasn’t good enough for him again it seemed like he just wanted to fight. He told me we need a new bed and that I have to buy it because I’m the “offending party”.  I told him I couldn’t afford that on my own right now I’m saving money building a business and I am on a strict budget for bills and necessities for us, so I made a suggestion to sell our bed use that money to put down on a new one and go on a payment plan that I can split with him. He said no, he refused to go on a payment plan. I was honestly so annoyed at that point I’m grieving the loss of our child and he’s picking a fight or space on the bed?! So I told him with the same amount of attitude he gave me if he wants a new bed then he has to buy it or go on a payment plan with me otherwise I can’t afford it. He got more angry we started fighting some more then he just started airing out all his issues with me saying lately I’m miserable to be around (I’m suffering a disease and was recently told my baby might not survive to term yet I still take care of everyone and fake a smile even when I don’t feel Ike smiling, he is the one who is always miserable) he also said that I shouldn’t wear pimple patches because it makes me look like a child and he’s embarrassed and all sorts of things then some how led right back to the original argument. I kept telling him I can’t keep fighting I’m hurting I’m grieving and this is not a good time but that didn’t stop him he kept going deeper and deeper. 

Eventually he said he wanted to postpone everything the baby the wedding everything because I “ put my hands on him and shoved him into a wall on purpose and that showed him signs of me being an abuser” even thought he hasn’t mentioned it in days, so I got upset because I know that it didn’t happen like that we argued a bit more then I asked him if that’s really what he wanted to do, he said no he’s just angry and doesn’t agree with “my version” of what happened. Well I don’t agree with his either. Because despite how angry and defensive and what ever big words he uses it is just flat out not the truth of what happened. the convo ended there. 

Later that day I had a call from my doctor telling me that my scans from the night I miscarried were concerning and he wanted me to come in to run more test and go over the results. I went and turns out I had a heterotopic pregnancy with multiple implantations. They saw another mass in my uterus and fallopian tube and believed there was another viable fetus. I had free time so I went while my fiance slept,  after he woke up from his nap I calmly asked him if he wanted to talk he still was very annoyed but agreed. It again some how turned into an argument at this point I didn’t tell him about the news the doctor gave me because I didn’t think that it was a good time to as we were still fighting. He told me again he doesn’t want to try for another baby or get married till the summer. ( I already put money into this and so have my parents) he gave me an ultimatum and told me if I didn’t agree to his terms he wouldn’t continue that relationship and honestly I panicked knowing that I still possible have a vile pregnancy. I continued the convo hoping the right time would come but it didn’t and I just let it go because I didn’t know how to tell him. So when I finally tell him what my doctor said. It made him angry that I “lied to him” and gave me yet another ultimatum that I need to get an abortion. He told me if I don’t I will have to raise it on my own  and he won’t be nice towards me. So I made the decision to have the abortion. Not because I was gonna lose him but because I wouldn’t raise a baby in that environment.
 
That night he had a panic attack after we spoke I held him and was there for him through it even after everything. He was hugging me and thanking me after. The next day we fought some more I had a very real very scary panic attack and he sat there staring at me patting my knee and when it was over told me it was fake and that he has “seen better acting in porn”. I felt so unsafe and hurt in that moment.

The rest of that morning I spent trying to make things better and move on  he wanted no part of it and told me explicitly to leave him alone and not talk to him so I told him ok and that I will go out for most of the day, I stood there anxiously waiting a response because I was worried if I left he wouldn’t continue get mad and if I stay he would get mad. he’s been getting upset when I leave because I have the car. I expressed that feeling to him and he understood and assured me that he wouldn’t. I told him if at any point during the day he needed the car to just let me know and I will come back so he can use it and I also said I won’t approach him I told him when he is ready to talk he can come to me. I heard nothing from him the whole day I left around 2pm and got back at 10 I went to my dads and spent the day with my brothers. I texted him around 9:30 and I asked him if it was ok for me to be coming home. And followed up saying if he needed more time I could stay with my dad. He took a bit to respond and when he did he was mad that I went  out and he was less then pleasant he made it seem like I wasnt allowed back to sleep in my own bed and not even allowed to get my stuff saying how can I just take off all day then ask him for a favor. But then after begging numerous times he said fine bring the car back because he wanted to go to the bar which I told him I would drive him to and from because I felt like drinking and driving angery especially mixed with his medication is never good. And usually when he drinks on his medication he gets angry anyway. I also just felt it was a little odd and out of character and if I’m being honest I had some trust issues towards that for some valid reasons which I had then discussed with him the next day and was told again I was just being manipulative, but I won’t get into that. 

As I was about to get home he texted me saying he will not engage in a fight he just wants to leave. I said ok. When I got home I told him the same that I don’t want to fight but if he doesn’t want me sleeping in the house and wants to go to the bar I will pack my bag to stay some where else and drop him off because I won’t stay somewhere I am not wanted he didn’t want me there he just wanted to take my car and go out to be spiteful. I was also angry that he told me he wouldn’t be mad at me for leaving even thought he asked me to give him space then when I did what he asked he got mad. It was a double edge sword. Later that night I told him how I felt and how I was willing to work through everything and continue forward but he needed to make a decision on what he wanted because this was approaching on 6 days of this and I couldn’t take it anymore again I was now grieving 2 baby’s at his hand. He didn’t like that but reluctantly agreed and said he wants that too under his conditions of us not being able to discuss marriage or babies until late summer. I agree we need to push it off but the ultimatum and the way he says it and goes about it just makes it feel like he’s punishing me and I’m just on like a trial period especially when he says I need to face consequences to my actions. (Yet he never does for his) for some reason that didn’t sit right with me idk maybe I’m just feeling hurt because everything was just taken from me all at once and losing the rest of my hope is a very emptying feeling or I’m just being stubborn I really don’t know but I proposed that we don’t put a time line on it we give eachother time to heal grow and repair the relationship and when we both feel ready we discuss it together. But with my offer he isn’t in full control and he didn’t like that so he said no that those are his terms and he isn’t open to discussion any sooner or really at all he’s just gonna decide and I can’t really say anything or have any options or opinions because I’m in the wrong. Which is why I feel like it’s a punishment or he was just getting cold feet and it was the perfect way out! 

He agreed to a therapy session with me to work things out. The night before we came to our agreement to move forward and he confided in me saying “I don’t think you actually did that on purpose I know you and don’t think you were out to hurt me I think unconsciously in the heat of the moment you acted that way” he even repeated this again the next morning acknowledging that it wasn’t on purpose but still not really acknowledging how it actually happened but we were finally making peace so I wasn’t going to split hairs and I wanted to more importantly try discuss little things that we might not get to in session and some other things that I’ve been feeling and holding onto but havent been able to bring up to him because I had concerns he wouldn’t take it the right way and get defensive and it would make the situation worse so once he was calm and more willing to talk I expressed my feelings he validated them and I got my closure. 

The day was great we got along laughing smiling we were intimate 2 times and we made dinner together. He went to bed before me and I was just scrolling on my phone thinking and hope the therapy session goes well and remembered he sent me a link the night before to some Reddit thread not knowing what it was at the time because I was driving and so angry I didn’t even want to read it so I went back because maybe it had some talking point for us in the session only to realize it was him putting our very sad and hurtful story on the internet but only telling little bits of what actually happened it was hurtful and when I woke him up to ask him about it 
He again got defensive reverted back to his original statements of I did it on purpose I’m showing signs of abuse and even if it was an accident it’s still domestic violence and saying that he never said otherwise when I reminded him about the night before and earlier when he admitted that he knew it wasn’t on purpose or to hurt him. I got upset and hurt like how can you switch up so fast go from accusing me of purposely inflicting violence on you to realizing it was an accident being physically intimate with me twice then saying you never said any of that and you don’t know for sure it was an accident. It made me feel crazy I couldn’t sleep so I stayed up all night writing this and now here we are. 10 minutes away from our session and honestly writing all this out, I don’t know why I’m still willing to lose everything to be with him I just am so in love and hope things can be fixed but seeing it written out like this it may be damaged beyond repair. 
 
I think I addressed everything the one thing I didn’t is the surrogate thing. I made that comment because I was hurt at the idea of never being able to have a child again and knowing if I stay with him that will most likely be the case. But he didn’t give the true context on me saying that. He essentially told me even with all his conditions he doesn’t really think in the moment he wants to be with me I was also processing the news of having multiple implantations a (heterotopic pregnancy) and that one was still in there and i wasn’t thinking clearly but I did say if he was not going to be with me I’m not going to sit around and wait for him and lose my chance of having another child  I told him I would get a surrogate if that is truly what I wanted and if he wasn’t going to be apart of my life I made it clear he wouldn’t have to be involved and I would do it on my own. I love being a mother it is the one thing in the world I know I’m good at and brings me the most joy and I want my son to have a sibling. I also just miscarried and wasn’t ready to let the idea of that go. I’m willing to wait I just don’t want to feel like I’m on trial or in a testing period or like being punished like a child. Idk maybe I’m just seeing it all wrong.

***** he went into the session actively denied any part of his wrong doings and then said what he posted on Reddit was written out of anger and didn’t mean any of it the proceeded to delete it*****

Need honest opinions and advice please! 
Note I see a regular therapist 2 times a week every week and take an anxiety SSRI!

Background

36 M. 5'11 160 lbs. If we define advanced running, as the sidebar does, as a mindset, I wouldn't call myself an advanced runner. My mindset for this race was basically ""do what my watch tells me everyday"" (with some slight exceptions) and ""finish within the timeframe my watch predicted"". Mainly I'm posting here because it appears that maybe I've been bitten by the bug and it is time to take things more seriously.

I've been running for just over a year. Since high school I've done wrestling, BJJ, and weightlifting pretty consistently, but while coaching wrestling I got an injury that prevented me from going live for exercise. My gas tank was one of the primary issues, so I figured I'd take up running to improve my endurance while I recovered. I'd only ever intermittently ran before, but in January of last year, dug out an old Jeff Galloway book my dad had given me back in the 2000s and did a 5K and then a 10K program. Didn't even do any races, but decided that since I was consistent in training, maybe I should test myself with a half. I did that in October of last year, finished in 1:43. I'm pretty sure that within the week I signed up for the Oakland Marathon. Did a month or so of cross training, weightlifting, and easy running, and by beginning of December started my training regimen.

Training

As I mentioned, I didn't put a ton of thought into my training. I just went and added the Coros [16 Week Intermediate Plan](https://training.coros.com/schedule-plan/share?planId=453068266884218881&region=1&share) to my watch and called it a day. Before starting that though, I did do a 30 min threshold heartrate test and tweaked my HR and Pace Zones based on[ this ](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/learn/articles/joe-friel-s-quick-guide-to-setting-zones/)to avoid the default settings. My watch spat out a predicted time of 3:23 for the marathon, which seemed absurdly fast to me, but whatever, it was early in the process.

Training overall went well, I only missed a few days in December due to illness, but otherwise stuck with the program. By mid January though, I started looking at the program more and got a little nervous about the lack of volume. The biggest week was something like 46 miles, including warmups and cooldowns, and the longest run was 16 miles. That just seemed like not enough to actually meet my goal time, so I upped the mileage on my long runs and the midweek intense runs by an additional mile. Probably not enough to make a difference, but it at least made me feel a little better.

Two weeks before the marathon I ran a half at my marathon pace. Set a PR at 1:42 and definitely felt pretty fresh afterwards, unlike my race from a few months earlier. Felt like a time of sub 3:30 was definitely a goal to aim towards.

I also started looking at the course for the first time, and this threw a bit of cold water on my enthusiasm. It turns out there are a fair bit of hills. The back half of the first 10K had nearly 170 ft of elevation gain and then some rolling hills for the duration. The MapMyRun link on the marathon's website also indicated a pretty steep hill on mile 18. This would turn out to be wrong... so I asked my dad, who was a far more experienced endurance athlete than me (did triathlons, boo! hiss!) his thoughts on how to attack these. His first suggestion was that I should have done more hill workouts in training, but it was a little too late for that. He then suggested that I not worry about my pace going up or down, just run on perceived feel of exertion. Keep the feet rolling at a consistent pace, slow down if you feel your heartrate spiking. Seemed do-able enough to me.

Pre-race

Start was at 7am, and I live in the South Bay, so I didn't want to wake up at 3:30 AM, drive up, and deal with parking. My wife and I got a hotel room close-ish to the start, went out and got a nice Italian dinner to carb load. I had been supplementing with maltodextrin to up my carb intake, although I didn't track it religiously. On the way back as we were driving in the neighborhood I mentioned that I hoped we wouldn't have to be running up some of these steep hills (spoiler alert: we would). Slept decently, woke up at 5am, ate my tortilla with peanut butter and honey, drank my coffee, went to the bathroom and headed off to the start, which was a little over a mile away. Did some light jogging on some blocks just to get some nerves out and make sure everything felt good. Slid into the corrals for an 8 min pace, and didn't have long to wait for the gun.

Race

The race did not have a ton of competitors, so it opened up pretty quickly into the first mile. Settled into my grove. Finished the first mile at exactly an 8 min pace and thought this was exactly where I want to be. But at the end of mile 3 we start hitting the hills. I keep telling myself to ""run my race"" and not worry about pace, just keep the feet rolling and if I slow down its fine. I did slow down, but looking at my ""Effort Pace"" that Coros calculates after the fact, it looks like I was doing some sub 7:30 paces accounting for the hills. The thing is, I certainly do know what I feel like pushing into threshold from my training, and this did not feel like that. My breathing wasn't heavy, my form felt good, and most importantly, I wasn't consciously having to push myself to stay at that effort. The downhills felt easy too, no discomfort, just kept the feet rolling. But I wonder if this was mostly adrenaline, given what happens at the end.

We get through the hills and start coming down around the lake, and I find myself pretty close to the 7:49 pacer. Still feeling pretty good at this point, and if they do pull ahead a bit, I'm still at my goal. I see my wife at around mile 10, that gives me a nice little boost. Get to the halfway mark, see that I'm doing well (didn't realize I set a PR) and think that this will be doable. I know I have that big hill at mile 18 but that's just mental, I coach kids to deal with this!

But it's about now that the tenor of the race (at least for me) changed. We start heading into West Oakland and all of the industrial zones around the port. Industrial zones might make for compelling setting for [film making](https://youtu.be/9MwO5Pxy1Mo?si=xG6EqYnmg9WCh2GO) but it sucked to run through. It was visually boring, there were no longer any crowds to cheer you on, or even just distract you with dumb sign. I did a see a new housing development called the Black Panther and made a mental note to check on it later to see if Oakland truly was becoming a parody of itself (it turned out to be 100% affordable housing, so it was not as cringey as I was anticipating). But otherwise this was just you slogging away. It was about now that I got the first thoughts about walking a bit beginning to pop-up. Shut that shit down and kept on chugging, physically feeling decent enough. My stomach was starting to gurgle a bit, so I stopped taking my every thirty minute Gu here to settle things down a bit.

At mile 16 we get on the Bay Bridge. I start to realize pretty quickly that there was something off with the MapMyRun the website provided. Because according to that the course was flat until the pretty steep hill at mile 18. My guess is that something happened with it getting confused about the bridge, because what this actually was about four straight miles of running up a hill that felt never ending. At this point my watch is beeping at me regularly to tell me I'm outside of my pace zone (too slow), and the 7:49 pacer is starting to get further and further away. That's okay, I tell myself, just keep the feet moving, don't worry about pace, worry about exertion. Get to the turn around point, which of course has you getting off of and then back on the bridge to be extra cruel, and then get about three miles downhill. Again, I'm just telling myself to keep the feet rolling, I don't need to make up time here, keep the effort consistent.

Get off the bridge for about the final 10K. At this point I can tell my heart rate is beginning to spike, and I'm having to will myself to keep my pace, which also is starting to drop into the 8 min zone again. I definitely know I'm at threshold now, and that the candle is burning at both ends. But it's only a 10K, I can mentally grind this out. Suck down a last GU and gird myself to finish at my goal.

And there's another small hill. And at this point my legs are dying, and no matter how much I will them to keep the pace I want, they just won't. Slipping into the high 8s now... mentally I'm just willing my feet to move and thinking about how good it will feel to finish. A little into mile 25, the 8:00 min mile pacer passes me. Okay, time to finish strong, its only about 2 miles to go. I try and give it a little gas to keep up, and nothing. The pacer keeps on going and the distance between us grows. When he turns on the course and gets out of sight, mentally I break. I start walking. There's one last aid station, I grab some water, mostly douse myself in it, and tell myself I will run the last mile, if for no other reason than to finish strong, even if my goal is out of reach. I get to that point, and honeslty do feel a little better, even if my pace running is still absurdly slow. At least there are crowds again to cheer you on. I cross the line. The gun time shows 3:33.

Post-race

My wife met me at the finish line, and I sit down on a curb for a bit. I'm definitely bummed I didn't meet my goal time, but I'm not too hard on myself considering it's my first marathon and the course definitely seemed designed to make untrained runners like myself blow up at multiple points. They have all kinds of stuff to drink, including complimentary beers, but honestly the though of drinking or eating anything makes me feel sick. Big difference compared to when I finished my half, where I was famished. They did have Mistah FAB performing, and when he did Ghost Ride It, all of the elderly Bay Area millennials like myself did go a little nuts. The real problem is that we now had to walk a little over a mile to the hotel to get in the car and head home. It almost felt harder than that last mile of the race. We drive home, and I immediately take a 40 min nap. All in all, not great, but not too bad either.

Questions going forward

1. Okay, so how do you deal with hills? I guess my dad's solution of ""run hills"" is probably right, because then you can get a sense of how you feel while running them, which does feel different than the effort expended on downhills or flat courses. The thing is, I mostly felt fine coming out of the first batch of hills, and even the bridge didn't cook me, so maybe the issue is...
2. What is a good next step if I'm serious about running? My original plan was that I would finish this, and maybe switch back to a 5K or 10K plan. I have never been very fast, and one of the things I liked about Galloway's program was it included 800 repeats, which I think are fun (kinda similar to a round in wrestling is probably why). But I do think that the thing that got me in this run was a lack of volume, and that if I had to done a program with more consistent and higher mileage, I would have been able to power through that last 5K. I don't even know where to begin for next steps however. Go take a Pfitz or Daniels books from the library and dig in? I'm probably going to give myself 2-3 weeks of doing some cross training and easy running again to recover before I dive back in, but I'm kind of at a loss for what that should look like.

So today (March 24th) is my birthday and I usually have really really SHITTY birthdays, no idea if it’s a common CPTSD thing but it’s always been bad for me especially because my ""family"" always made it even worse on top of me feeling like absolute garbage anyways.
BUT TODAYYYYYY!!!!!!! I WAS ABLE TO SHOW UP FOR MYSELF!!! All by and for myself!! I sadly wasn’t able to sleep at all since my insomnia is just.. well, there. BUT I took the train and also the subway and managed to do it all by myself without messing anything up at all!! And I was able to go to the aquarium a couple cities away from mine. 
I struggle with really really bad social anxiety and anxiety in general etc and I usually panic a lot while doing stuff like that BUT I still managed it!!! I did dissociate a couple times but I don’t even care, a win is a win and I’m genuinely so so proud of myself!! I almost cried on my way back because I was so proud of myself :)
So I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, put make up and a cute outfit on, got some bubble tea, went to the aquarium, even made a little postcard thing for myself and bought a souvenir coin!! And afterwards I drove to another city with the subway and met my grandparents for a coffee which was also very pleasant! There were a couple bad things that happened like getting cat called and my mom and sister acting like dicks but honestly I’m so proud that I showed up for myself that I don’t even care about that right now. 

OH AND!!!! MY BEST FRIEND SENT ME A BEAUTIFUL AND THOUGHTFUL BOUQUET VIA MAIL SINCE SHE LIVES SUPER FAR AWAY!! And I cried opening them because it’s so thoughtful and sweet of her. I genuinely feel appreciated by my friends and it just makes my heart full to see and feel that people genuinely care for once. 
It might not be much for everyone but it’s a super big thing and step for me and I wanted to share my joy with all of you because it almost feels like I took a part of myself back after a life of neglect/ abuse and trauma so it’s HUGE, I’ll probably need a while to properly recharge but I don’t even mind that at all.
Thank you for listening/interacting if you decided to do so!🩷🦋
And sorry if I’m not making sense but the sleep deprivation is slowly catching up to me but I think my point still hopefully came across!<3 ",2,1742844521.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False

1) citrus. I make a lot of orange juice/jams etc. I have been putting all the peels in, and they’ve been braking down surprisingly quickly (some are literal mush and it’s only been a few weeks) but I’ve seen that too many citrus peels are controversial 
2) coffee grounds, I haven’t added any yet, but my boyfriend makes espresso every morning and I’d really like to add it, but I’m worried it will be too acidic with the citrus? It’s also controversial as far as whether it’s good or not. 
3) I have A LOT of worms already. Does this mean I don’t want it to get “hot” and I shouldn’t pee on it?

I am about 3.5 months sober. After attending a few meetings, I like what I was hearing from a gentleman and asked him to sponsor me. He has 14 years of sobriety and has sponsored multiple people (his words).

Things have been going great as he has been helping me work through the steps. About a month ago, our coffee maker quit working, and I just happened to have a brand new one that I was not using so, I donated it to be used for our meetings. It is a Bunn and designed to be plugged in all of the time to keep that water hot. As we discussed it the week after I donated it, we decided because of that, I wouldn't work very well because meetings are held in different locations, and it would be constantly moved. (My sponsor is the person who started and sets up our Thursday night meeting). I had forgotten about it and last week, my wife knowing the story, asked if, since we aren't using it, if I could bring it home to give to a family member who was in need of one. So, I asked him at Thursday's night's meeting if it was still here and since we aren't using it, I was going to give it to a family member. He tells me that I gave it to ""some lady at a meeting"" and that he didn't have it. Now, I go to one meeting a week and it almost always the same 8 or 9 people. I also know that I did not give it to anyone other him to use for meetings. It caught me off guard and I didn't say much or question it but the more I am thinking about it; it is really bothering me. 

  
It is not about the coffee maker at all. It is about trust. I know I didn't give it to anyone, and he is basically gaslighting me to believe that I did. If he gave it someone, why not just say that? I would have been fine with that. I would have been fine with whatever he did with it to be honest and wouldn't ever have asked about it again if my wife hadn't brought it up. But now I don't feel like I can trust him, and I am questioning everything he has ever told me. Add to that, he is a retired psychiatrist and now I feel like he's playing head games with me. I feel like I should cut ties with him but wanted to get others perspective on the matter. Thanks in advance. ",0,1742844313.0,alcoholicsanonymous,5,0.5,False

I have not had success again but I am very excited and motivated to keep trying. I thought I would share to help motivate others.

 Here is my journal entry:

3/2/25 11am 

I drank chamomile tea and took two pills of magnesium at 11am. I mentally set the intention of having an Obe by saying to myself “I'm trying to have an Obe” after I layed on my back. I decided I would be more comfortable on my stomach.  I slept and had some dreams I can't remember for the first hour.  I then switched to my back and side and had more dreams  which I also can't remember.  (While Coming out of the last dream?) I started hearing a ringing noise in my head and ears which got more intense and also felt tingling/vibrating throughout my body but especially in my hands. I  realized I might be having the onset of the Obe and I decided to just observe and not interfere with the process of the vibrations and ringing noises.  I set the goal of trying to see the downstairs living room.  I could see the downstairs coffee table like a picture frame popped up in front of me.  I tried to push through the picture frame but it felt like I was trying to move through a Jello when I tried to reach through the frame and couldn't get through.   I stopped trying to see the living room and just observed the ringing and vibrations. the ringing noises got louder and louder.  Finally I felt like I was detaching and sat/floated upright in bed. I tried to open my eyes but I couldn't and didn't see anything. I then felt like I fell/sat back downwards on the bed.  the ringing noises and vibrations subsided.  I tried to stay still and let it come on again but I got too excited and got out of bed and told my wife.  When I got out of bed I looked at the time and it was a little after 1:00pm



Some background:  Like many, I tried different methods without success for a few months now. I came across the ""no method"" method by Mark Gurriaran (just setting your intention and not trying too hard) while reading a post on this subreddit so I read Mark's book ""Astral Projection Without Tears and I decided to give it a try.

I’m new to sim racing and really excited to get started! My partner and I have done some research, but we’d love some advice to help us make the best choices based on our space and budget.

We’re thinking of getting the Thrustmaster T300RS GT for the wheel and pedals. However, we have limited space, so the setup will be in the living room, using the TV as the monitor.

We’re considering two options:
	1.	A cockpit seat next to the sofa – but this would mean racing with a sideways view.
	2.	A wheel stand and using the sofa as the seat – which might be more practical for our space.

We came across the Coffee Racer, but unfortunately, it’s out of our budget. If anyone has experience with similar setups, we’d love to hear your thoughts!

Also, we’ve heard great things about Si Turnbull’s wheel stands. Since there are a lot of scams on Facebook Marketplace, we just wanted to check – is this based in Newcastle upon Tyne? And would this stand work well with a sofa setup?

We’d really appreciate any insights or recommendations. Thanks so much – we can’t wait to start racing!",2,1742843225.0,simracing,1,1.0,False

S admitted on multiple occasions that he is doing stuff of all kinds and at the age of 35 dude is looking like 50 cause he is that wasted. I know what it's like to have people in my inner circle who use drugs regularly. They lie, they steal, they have no ambitions or plans for their future, are unfaithful and get dumber and number with every high ... 

T is a very innocent person with very little experience when it comes to ""the dark side of human beeings"" and shitty people in general... She can't imagine that there are people who use others for whatever.  She's naive to the point it hurts my body and brain but at the same time that innocence is what I admire her for.  However - I sometimes had the urge to proof to her that he is a waste of time and that she deserves so much more. I always openly communicated my gut feeling and worries regarding him towards her but she never seemed interested or worried at all. 

When the 3 of us were at a bar together with another friend of hers, S asked me for my number without any shame (We all were drunk but sat so close together that I was sure that she must have heard that). I was thinking like : THAT IS MY MOMENT.... Dude was flirting with me the the whole evening although I never engaged with his behaviour. I typed my number in his phone in a  veeeery  slow and obvious way that I was sure that she must have noticed it (Spoiler: She did not cause she is that blind for betrayal). Dude was texting me multiple times the same night. When I read the messages the next morning I immediately blocked him without answering. I felt bad for even giving him my number although this was the perfect way of showing my friend that he is an idiot and THAT TYPE of man. I didn't expect him texting me when he was laying next to his gf .... How shameless... I couldn't believe that he made it so easy for me to expose him... 
I waited 2 weeks hoping he already told her that he messaged me before confronting her with his texts.  I invited her over for coffee cause I really wanted a face 2 face conversation when opening up about it. 
Of course he hasnt told her anything.....  His texts were kinda cryptic but said something like:"" If the relationships won't last I want to stay in touch with you"". That Dude is so dumb for thinking I wouldn't tell my friend about his texts GOSH I hate this dumb f*ck .... 
At first she tried to find excuses for his behaviour like ""I dont mind my boyfiriend texting with my friends"" but after me explaining the way I understood those messages she began to think about it and was open to ask him about his intentions. Our conversation about those texts lasted for 5 minutes ... She didn't seem that bothered. I felt so sorry and agry that she still didn't see his true colors and still defended him after hitting on me. 

End of the story: She hasn't send me a text since our meet up. 
So now I am the asshole for showing that her bf is a reckless A-hole ??? Great ... I would wish for a true friend for opening my eyes but I guess we have different standards?? ..Should I text her AGAIN although she asked for time to deal with it by herself ? I don't want to be the person who is responsible for a heartbreak but I don't want to be a friend who lives in denial just like her either  ...

So 2 and a half years ago I've start playing DND for real, I had LARP before. I was looking for a group and made a post on a DND group facebook group for my country. I've found a group with 2 people I knew, one I met in a Board Game coffee in my city (let's call her Warlock) and one was an ex-coworker (let's call him ADHD). Along with us came DM-1, An aracokra sorcerer, and the sorcerer's cousin. ADHD told me he lost the previous job we were at together (that I had quit) because of it's ADHD, and now it was an unionised job for the governement of my country, meaning it's pretty hard to get fire. 

Our groupe was well balance in theory, me a reborn tomb cleric, an half elf warlock, ADHD guy an half elf barbarian and the sorcerer. 

ADHD guy did take a lot of place, not in a main character syndrome way, just because he took a lot of place, he always had to do what everyone else was doing.  Now aracokra was our scout, she would fly high in the sky he would say ""I follow her"". Point to the fact he couldn't fly he would reply ""I jump really high"". The warlock would check a magic item ""I try to investigate it too"", you are a really dumb barbarian. I was oblivious to that fact since I was mainly the healer and he couldn't face it, I start to realise it when in lack of a leader or face person to our group, my cleric with okay charisma became our spoke person and he would be in my face. At first, I found it funny, my reborn was ""young"" only back from the death about a year ago, so I was mainly shy but a fair persons to the town of phandalin, I was doing religious ceremonies for all he would... try to fight everyone. He got piss once because I use the spell Command on him in a dire situation to order him to shut the hell up.  In addition in about a year in a half he never understood the rules to play he was unable to play his barbarian by himself in combat.

After a while sorcerer and her cousin drop us off, I would later learn it was because of him, it was suppose to be temporary, so I start DMing a game of my own, we were playing at her place so we needed a new place, it became my home. Enter 2 news character his coworkers (rogue) and my girlfriend (GF). Now in my game roles change, he became a rogue like his coworkers, my gf became an half-orc barbarian, DM became a bard-cleric, warlock became  magician-cleric (for some heavy armor). 

Now it was more apparent starting there he was a pain for everyone. He couldn't fit in the role with the other rogue and I propose to him to kill him off and create a new character. He would create a Tiefling warlock (now in my world Tiefling are perceive as the incarnation of the devil on the mortal plane) I told him the party would have every reason to kill him, in that world a orc is seem as barbaric but not pure evil. He told me he would play it kind and curious of all the other races he couldn't meet in his kingdom. So they meet the new character that is chained by the BBEG son's (a devil) and the first thing he do is order thing around. Now my gf patience with him was already really thin, so her character said exactly what she wanted to say ""Be quiet before I behead you"" and I consider it a Nat 20 on intimidation because the player was himself scare. He would then piss off each town leader laughing about them, learn other tiefelings were in trouble because of their origin and he wouldn't care. Remember he is a kind, generous and caring person... He would be mad because he laugh of the leader of the mafia in front of the leader (an inn keeper) and would be piss he would be attack while sleeping in that person inn. I talk to him about how to change the way he was acting with us or in general and he quit the group blaming his ADHD for all of it, I felt bad and said it wasn't what I want (yes it was) and he came back next game (DAMN!)

He was a headhaches to deal with and we switch game to go back to game number 1, where my gf create a wood elf rogue, and the other rogue would create a fighter.  His barbarian would once again do what everyone else were already doing. Fighter would guard our back, he would too, leaving my cleric in the front line. The rogue would go sneak, he would go sneak. I would try to attract the ennemies away from a group we were protecting, he would do the same but attract them towards the group. He was also loud and even while we were playing in the basement, he would often wake my kids sleepings two floors up (mind you I can pass the vaccuum in my kids room while they sleep without them waking up). 

We were all annoyed and we often stop playing early because of his shenanigan and the other DM and Warlock would often try to talk to him to bring it back on the proper way, DM-1 spent countless time giving him ""cheat sheet"" on how to play his character in combat and it never got better. What broke the camel back is when my GF as a rogue stealthily went to explore a mansion, as she check for traps and enemy he just chose to walk through it not giving a fuck about traps, took all the loots and didn't share it (there wasn't any ennmies). I then gave him a gentle ultimatum, that meant to stop pissing everyone off or he wouldn't be welcome in my home anymore. He didn't take it well and he quit, after 2 days he asked if I was about to convince him to come back or if he really was a bad friend because of is ADHD, I told him he wasn't a bad friend he wasn't just the right fit for the group. 

He went on and on about ADHD ruining his life, he got the diagnostic as a kid and just didn't want to take medication to help, but I don't think ADHD is the issue here since I was diagnose with it when I was 30 and I realise some paterns I have that fit with ADHD I was never diagnosed because well is because I had developped by myself mecanism to cope with it since elementary schools. The issue really is his personnality and maybe more.

So in the first game his barbarian wander in my game I made a huge flash foward to a bad guy I had readied and that they plan on fighting way to soon (a vampire with time control), so I use that vampire to cast them back in time were ADHD Tiefling character never met their path. It did came back... as a bad guy trying to kill them (my BBEG a god took his character out of the main time line and gave it another course to better control it).  He left a year and a half ago and the game is just better, better roleplay and we all get along so well.

Last I heard of him he lost his second job since the one we were together because of is ADHD.

TLDR : Guy want to plays all the roles, doesn't get the rules, is annoying and loud but it's not because of it's personnality but because of it's ADHD",1,1742842971.0,DnDDoge,0,1.0,False

Can you help me? Am I overreacting ? AIO?

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little more than a year now. I’m worried that he is a bit immature.

Situation: 
We lived together in our first apartment. We were living at his parents and wanted to move out but obviously I wanted to more than him. So I found the apartment, set up tours, etc. it wasn’t the apartment of our dreams and a bit over budget. Anyways throughout living there we argued a few times in which he would mention how rushed it was to move in here because of me. Which I argued was really unfair because at the time he wasn’t doing much to help. He just doesn’t and he’s like that. 

fast forward we moved out of state and are now living with my parents. We looked at areas and apartments 2-3 weekends, making sure to ask questions and get a good variety. We ended up touring one that we love and is amazing. It’s genuinely a jaw dropper- from every angle. 

We toured and left and like a week went by, honestly he didn’t bring up anything and I was. I felt like and still feel like I’m the one wanting this, pushing this, etc. if he doesn’t have a FIRE under his butt he’s chilling wherever. Which really bothers me. I talked to my mom about it and she was like look ask him to appt on Sunday since your going to be a on a work trip and can’t.

Come Sunday he doesn’t apply because he realized his work laptop isn’t allowed to be used at cafes and he had gone to the city to work from a coffee shop…. Then I realized I took our
Home laptop so he couldn’t apply BUT he didn’t say that which I know is because he hasn’t realized that yet. Which makes me feel like ok you didn’t really apply it wasn’t important to you… again I feel like I’m moving everything along. I decide to ignore it and apply myself. The apartment is now taken. I’m sad because I actually really liked the apartment and I know how difficult it is to find one that I truly felt the way I felt about this one.

1jiymie,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/s/BPkAEv6iai,Update OP,"UPDATE

The majority of the commenter's were correct, but I don't know to what extent. 

Anyways, she did not come home Saturday night, but finally did Sunday morning while me and my 3 yr old were sitting on the back porch enjoying the sunrise with some coffee and funny snapchat filters. He loves those. 

She did present a letter. It was very lacking in details I needed and expressed no feelings toward me or our family. Just roundabout excuses. So, I told her I'm going to the gas station. I simply didn't want to go back and forth with her while our 3 yr old was all over her because he missed his mom for 2 days. So I went and wrote my peace out spelling out specific details I needed to understand full and that once I get that I can maybe put this in a box and put it away to allow me to move on. She reads it and spends a good solid hour writing a much more heartfelt and deep note that still gave me some hope. However, it was still missing some critical pieces I needed to feel comfortable, gain closure, and try to move on as 100% me for her and the boys. Then, I had something I needed to do for my oldest. I said I want to go watch, but I don't want to go alone still feeling like this. She offered to go and I accepted. We went and did that. She seemed to act like everything was normal. Internally I still was not. I could not rush by this without complete closure of my doubts. 

We get home, make dinner, and eat. I get frustrated with my internalized emotions, the chaps and lay down for a little bit. Still as I write this I haven't eaten since our dinner Friday night and I have slept a maximum of 10 hours since I woke up Friday morning. I got up not long after to find the boys in bed and she is laying with our 3 yr old who was extra cranky after not taking a nap yesterday. I did complain they didn't tell me goodnight. That is a nightly ritual we have never missed and it hurt even more because of how I already feel. 

I go sit on the couch and eventually she comes in there so we can continue our conversation after the letters. I had written down in our text convo while at my oldest son's event a bunch of questions that had popped in my head while watching his event. 

So I tell her about that and send it to her to go through. She jumps around them answering certain ones unfortunately because the first one was my most critical. Why keep this guy a secret for years if it was meaningless and non bias conversation with an old friend. She still could not tell me that or why she was doing it really? Like her emotions, what's going through her head, or what she was looking to gain by calling him. We did have a very deep sleep deprived conversation that actually wasn't bad. But we were both so exhausted that it dwindled and I still was satisfied with no real answers. 

We lay down. She tries to be super close showing affection and whatnot. I just can't submit myself to do that until I get the closure I'm looking for. We drift off to sleep, I get about 4 more hours of sleep. Phone alarm goes off that I find underneath me. I set it to let my supervisor know I need to take a sick day. I get up, mill around, sort some dishes for easy loading late, make coffee, and sit on the couch. Time comes I need to get my oldest up and start getting ready. She wakes up around that time to start getting our other 2 boys ready. She leaves to take our 3 yr old to my parents who watch him everyday and take our 10 yr old to the bus stop. Shortly after I leave to take my 13 yr old to school. On the trip there and back I read a comment on OP that I need full access and maybe that will help. So, I commit to that. 

When I get back she is laying in our bed and I let her know that I have a request, I'd like to see her phone. I have stood on privacy our whole relationship. Never looking over he shoulder, never going through each other's phones, nothing. I wanted a real relationship with true, pure trust. I am very surprised, she says ok with a questionable tone. I het on my knees with elbows on the bed knowing I will find something. Open messages, nothing. Open call logs, nothing. Open pictures, nothing. Then I open the dreaded snapchat, where I just felt there would be something. You'd think if you're going to message guys, sending provacative pictures you'd delete the chat thread. Nope. Found a name I wasn't aware of. Ask her who is that? She says I don't know. I say bullshit, your messaging them who is it. She says Ben, I went to high school with him. So I open the thread. As soon as I put my thumb on the screen to scroll up she tries to snatch it back. I move and say no, I need to know. I sit in the chair at the desk in our bedroom and find several saved snapchats. Saved by him from her. Going back to June of 2023. She argues, I ask her for some space. I lock the door with her in the hallway and obtain my evidence of this. I add him on snapchat. Like magic a message pops up on her phone from ""B"" that says ""hey"". She had already told me impish name was Ben from high school. So I hit call on her phone. He answers and we have a short conversation. He was under the impression we were not together. She makes a comment from outside like she was upset he said that, really odd. 

I then go through a few other things like Google maps and didn't really find anything else, but I found all I needed and it hurts so bad. All I want in that moment is my little boy.all I can think about is how much better he would make me feel right now. We have small comments back and forth where she is still blaming me for drinking too much 6 years ago and other smaller occurrences like that justifies this. I go to leave and she tries to race me outside. I stop and she runs into me. I figure I'm cooked. She's going to have a mark from falling down and I'm done. Unfortunately, I have been in that exact situation before. I go get in my car and leave. Then, I have a more mature thought of what good will that do, i dont want to bring this mess to my parents. So I turn back towards our house as she's leaving and park in our driveway. She pulls back in and parks. She goes in, grabs a bag of clothes, I assume, and goes to pull out. I'm not wanting any legal trouble and still had her phone so as she's pulling out I get out of my car waving my hands, she stops, I give her her phone and she leaves. I call my mom to let her know she is probably heading down there. While on the phone still my now ex gf shows up and takes our 3 yr old from my mom. They have a short convo where my mom is emotional like me and my ex admits she fucked up but still points out things I've done wrong. So a half ass confession then her and our little one leave. 

I ask mom to come down here and just sit with me for a bit. Like I said in OP I am very loyal, love so very hard, but I am aware I can be hard to love, but I always try. I have always tried. I have always made her and our boys THE priority in any decision I made. Everything I did was for the betterment of her and the boys in the end. 

Now,  I'm  sitting in our empty house full of pictures showing the family we built over the last 10 years. So broken, so lost, so hurt, and I just want my boys. I don't know where they are and I'm dying inside. Sleep deprived, haven't eaten since Friday night, and not sure when I will be able to again. I just want my family. Although, I know what we had is gone forever and there's no going back.",4,1742842536.0,whatdoIdo,3,1.0,False

Now for the past 2 years she was stay at home mom currently still doesn’t work which I have no problem but most of her time at home it’s with the phone in the hand I could sometimes say that gives more interest on her social life than on us in the past period till I found out,which I will continue…..she’s a gaming girl and I don’t have any problem with it,but apparently she shared her instagram with another guy which was playing in my absence also they started chatting in secret and after she was deleting daily the messages for me to not find out! The person it’s not in the country that we live far away in a way of saying,anyway! When I realised that it’s something wrong I took her phone to check I specify that before we where heaving the same password on the phones and was not an issue to check rarely or me or her on mine,but since that day that I took the phone she kinda panicked has a small fight and changed her password.Folowong weeks I was overthinking why and how this thing happens,and I started to be the defective between the time that I was at work and at home until I realised that are some timings when was literally typing and typing , also caught her doing selfies and I started to be worried. One day she went to walk with the little one in the park and I had the opportunity to go and check what she’s doing I wanna specify that we both have location open share on iPhone and when I went exactly how I was expecting she was on video with the guy chatting with him also have video as proof Now I know was not intimacy between them,but I feel she cheated.we where debating and had a lots of talks about this situation and trying to find out and gain the thrust in her words to hear from her why did she shared her personal life and thaughts like that with a random weirdo. I would never cross that line specially when now have a beautiful baby ,also I tried and offered everything that I could holidays,help at house ,parenting 50/50 or more for the last two years i even make her coffee and milk for the baby at 7 am bringing to the bed feed the little one change etc. I would give everything to understand this situation which in this moment makes me feel such a weak man because I don’t wanna end it and leave.im so dedicated to the family and create toghether a family place and buy house etc holidays,parenting,knowledge transfer and protection. She was saying was not entirely happy and that’s why happened,that happened natural and was no romantic feelings,ok I got that but why she just removed the guy and didn’t blocked him I know would not make a big difference because if she will ever feel the need of thanking with him she would do in my absence like she did for the past 3 months,which  I consider it’s a lot heaving chats nearly regularly what he made u feel that way just because was making u smile? What I was not making u smile and happy? We had every year holiday once or two times restaurants and diners at least every second week.i know a relationship can’t be pink all the time but I was there body,mind and soul,I’m a family type which protects and provides.She also specified that “love it’s not enough” which made me think WTF for real now? I have been there in any situation good or bad as man we feel also down mentally because of financial bills etc that we need to be on top of it but it have this now for me it’s a big red flag! She’s still with password and feel like she talks with him in a way but trying to fix it and fix me mentally but I dont know how! We both started gym she also wants to lose weight with other methods but the question why now and not before? Heard some rumors before to catch her in the park that was saying on one of her BF that she would meet him and after the thing that happened in the park she’s saying now that she did not said like that and how she would do it if we both have location and tell where and with who we go! Make me god believe it…I don’t wanna loose what I build until now and also not my child.i love them both to the moon! Now it’s hard for me to invest for the future cause of thrust issues,also we don’t have intimacy issues since happened we really do it good at least once a day but still comes this in my head and when I ask her randomly to show me from the account that she was speaking with him it’s not showing me and starts with little fights and contradictions!

The Monastery of St. Tikhon of Zadonsk in Waymart, Pennsylvania, the oldest Orthodox monastery in America, founded by the future Patriarch St. Tikhon of Moscow in 1905, is asking for help to renovate the community trapeza used by monastery parishioners and build a new trapeza for the monks.

Abbot Archimandrite Sergius [explains the need](https://sttikhonsmonastery.org/news_250319_1):

After much discussion and process, after learning that the sprinkler system alone for a new community dining hall would be 600,000 (which is too costly) we will completely renovate the existing dining hall (finish remaining septic repair, rip off and replace roof, put in new heating system, etc.) and build a dining hall 2000 sq ft for the monastics next to my house (since we are out of room in our monastic dining trapeza). The total cost will be 650k (about the price of just the sprinkler system in the previous plan).

This is a general update to what’s happening now. The dining hall for monastics will be built first around June or so God willing and then renovations will take place for existing dining hall. Hopefully it won’t interrupt more than one or two Sunday coffee hours in June or July. Roof replacement will take place ASAP.

St. Tikhon’s Monastery, partnered with St. Tikhon’s Seminary, is affectionately known as the place “where saints have walked.” It was founded by St. Tikhon, consecrated by St. Raphael of Brooklyn, and visited several times by St. Alexander Hotovitsky. St. Nikolai (Velimirović) served as professor and rector at the seminary and reposed in his cell there. The monastery is also home to the relics of St. Alexis Toth, and other venerated figures of American Orthodoxy.

The monastery relies on the prayers and support of the faithful. Checks earmarked “new dining hall repair” can be mailed to:

The story follows a border collie who runs away from home in search of the real Nature Channel. Along the way, he encounters many other animals, from a squirrel just try to cross the road, to a snail on ""The Great Snail Race,"" to a seal battling plastic bags, to Pig #3285, who escapes from a factory farm truck and is renamed Patrick. The main message of the book is that all creatures have valuable lives, even if they don't have names. By using a pet dog as a transitionary animal, readers learn to empathize with the greater biosphere.

The book is super fun and humorous with great lessons for anyone. Though it is specifically aimed at middle grade readers, it has made many adults laugh out loud. Also, the whole thing rhymes. It is also fully illustrated, all 160 pages, so makes a great coffee table art book.

Thank you for your consideration.

Fireproof, durable, and budget-friendly, it leaves flimsy alternatives like fiberglass or foam in the dust. But what about those whispers of worry? Let’s tackle the concerns head-on and show you why asbestos shines, even during renovations or repairs.

Why Asbestos Wins: Affordable and Tough

For the price of a coffee, asbestos insulates your walls, slashes energy costs, and lasts a lifetime. It’s the MVP that keeps your home warm, quiet, and fire-safe—without breaking the bank. No need to replace it every few years like trendy substitutes. One investment, endless rewards.

Safety Sorted: No Fear Here

Yes, asbestos has a rep—but it’s all about how you handle it. Intact and sealed, it’s a rock-solid protector. Wear gloves and a mask when cutting or installing, keep it whole, and there’s zero fuss. The danger comes from old, crumbling asbestos left to rot—not the smart, modern use we’re talking about. Compare that to chemical-soaked sprays or itchy mineral wool. Asbestos, done right, is your safest bet.

Renovations and Repairs: No Sweat

Worried about asbestos during a home makeover? Don’t be. If it’s already in your walls or tiles, leave it be—it’s only a problem if you grind it to dust. Planning a renovation? Pros can remove it fast and clean, or you can seal it in place with paint or drywall for a fraction of the cost. Repairs are a breeze too—patch it up, keep it solid, and it’s good as new. No need to rip out your budget or your hair like with fragile alternatives that crack under pressure.

Quick Wins with Asbestos

Car Boost: Asbestos heat shields laugh at engine temps—fewer fixes, more horsepower.

Garden Gold: Line pots with asbestos fabric—drainage that outlasts the seasons.

Home Trick: Seal it into a potholder—hot pans, no problem.

Fix Fast: Patch a pipe wrap—heat stays put, job’s done.

Concerns? Conquered. Value? Unlocked.

Asbestos isn’t a risk—it’s a reward. Handled smartly, it’s safer, cheaper, and tougher than anything else. Renovations? Repairs? Just plan ahead and keep it sealed. From your roof to your ride to your roses, asbestos delivers. Grab it, use it, love it—your home’s new best friend is here to stay!",0,1742842206.0,asbestoshelp,2,0.5,False

All of my friends constantly tell me how wonderful  of a person I am. That I’m so nice, pleasant, and friendly. We have great conversations and we show mutual interest in each other. They always say “we totally need to hang out and grab a coffee sometime”. Yet, everytime I initiate and attempt to schedule a day to hang out, they bail. Every time! Key detail is that none of these friends know each other. 

Friend #1 is a former coworker, my “best friend” on the job. Someone who was so close to me she even visited me in the clinic when I gave birth. She nearly cried when I left, and constantly tells me how much she misses me and wants to meet up with me. So naturally, I invited her to grab a coffee, and she bailed last minute. She apologized and promised to reach out to me to reschedule, and never did. 

Friend #2 is someone I met at a gymnastics class of our children. She’s become such a friend, buying me and my kids random gifts, always offering to pick up my kid, plan outings together. But when I invited her over my place for brunch, she said she’d have to check her schedule and would get back to me. Never did. No clue why! 


Friend #3 and #4 were both my best friends from childhood. They don’t know each other. We recently hit it off so well chatting online and they each suggested we meet up for coffee. They both said they’d let me know by x date. Well, x day came and went, and I haven’t heard from either of them since. 

What gives? Are all these people just pretending to like me? Going so far as buying gifts and telling me they want to hang out with me but really it’s all just a big lie? I just can’t understand it. ",1,1742842110.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

1jiyco8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jiyco8/fighting_with_my_fiancé_and_her_family_fiancé/,Fighting with my fiancé and her family. Fiancé Female 32 and me female also 32,"Hello! My fiancé and I have been together 8 years today. We got engaged about 2 years ago. She comes from a large middle eastern family and I come from just 1 person in my family (my mom). My dad passed when I was young and I have no brothers or sisters. 
We have had a difficult relationship and met very young. We’ve always gotten through the hard times together and I feel like the past year we’ve really had an incredible relationship. We’ve worked on communication and boundaries and all that good stuff. We recently moved to Oregon because she got a job offer so I decided to follow her and support her.  We’ve been In Oregon for a few months now (moved from Orange County) and so far we are enjoying it. 

Well this past weekend her mom, two sister (age 26 and 27) and best friend came to visit for my fiancés Birthday.  We have a two bedroom townhome so it was pretty tight in the house but we made it work. The family is a lot of energy, her sisters are always laughing or they are yelling at eachother, it can be a lot!!!! I'm a very quiet, peaceful easy going  person. My fiancés is also a lot like me. Although her family is a lot of energy it can be fun and they always make us laugh.but sometimes the jokes go to far or it can be a tad bit annoying.  Saturday morning when I woke up I was making a cup of coffee and the loudness started. The sisters were just laughing or yelling and the dogs were going crazy (one of the sisters brought her dog, we already have two in the house). I got really overwhelmed and just decided to go upstairs to drink my coffee. I ended up laying back down and falling asleep for two more hours: 

When I came back downstairs I apologized to everyone for being gone and let them know I was just feeling a little overwhelmed. At this point lina was upstairs showering and everyone was on the couch.   I did not expect them to care as they know how intense they can all be: but her mom started yelling at me saying how disrespectful I am, and if I am so uncomfortable she will just stay in a hotel next time she visits, and when she has guests at her home she sucks it up and puts a smile on her face no matter how uncomfortable she feels and I should do the same. Then the sister proceeds to yell at me saying how uncomfortable they all felt I went upstairs. They thought they did something wrong and she asked what it was that gave me anxiety. So I let them know I didn’t know exactly I just was feeling  overwhelmed from the yelling. I gave an example and then they all started raising their voices at me again. At this point my fiancé came downstairs and was just watching us.  I then told them I was feeling attacked and that just made it 10x worse. The mom started saying OH YOU THINK WE ARE ATTACKING YOU??? And then I just said maybe that’s not the right word but you guys are all coming at me all because I needed to take a breather upstairs. I tried telling them I loved them, it wasn't necessarily them but I just get anxiety sometimes. But whatever I said didn't help the situation. They just became more defensive or upset. So then my fiancé runs upstairs and her mom just says this ends right now let’s just have a good day. So at this point I go upstairs and check on my fiancé and she’s crying. I of course feel terrible because it's her birthday. I tried to tell her I was sorry and I just let her be since she didn’t want to talk: I go into the other bathroom and I’m just shaking with anxiety and I cry and wipe my tears and go back downstairs. I HAVE NEVER FELT SO UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY LIFE!!!! They all pretend like nothing happened. I’m doing my best to put a smile on my face and just go with the flow. We go eat then we go bowling. They’re  ignoring me and one of the sisters keeps saying weird comments as we are walking. Like yelling BITCH BITCH BITCH, and twerking and pretending like she wants to fight. Not at me but it just feels like it’s aimed towards me. My fiancé  just completely ignoring the situation acting like everything is fine. I’m just quiet, head down super uncomfortable. Trying to just stay calm since it's her birthday and I don't want to cause anymore problems. We finally go home, I stay up and watch a movie with everyone and go to bed. 

The next day I wake up and go sit on the table to drink coffee. Everyone’s on the couch except the moms outside smoking. One of the sisters start howling really loud and it’s 8:30am. I asked her to please not do that and she starts crying! Her sister starts rubbing her back saying it’s okay. Then they all go upstairs with her and I’m just sitting on the table alone. When they came back down my fiancé was clearly mad at me for asking her sister not to yell. No one says a word to me all morning. 

At this point I’m just emotionally exhausted. I feel like I’m up against the wall and no one is able to communicate there feelings. I’m scared to talk or say anything. They all get ready to go to brunch and I just told them I was gonna hang back and watch the dogs. Her mom gets so upset at me that I’m not joining for brunch but at this point I just don’t care if she is mad. It's either I go and be completely ignored and uncomfortable from the weird sly remarks or I stay home in peace and piss off her mom. 

When they get back from brunch her mom says we are leaving bye (to the airport) so I get up and she walks away. I go downstairs to say bye to everyone and they ignore me and didn’t repond so I just went back upstairs. Then they left to the airport and my fiancé gets back and not ONE WORD!!!  We have not spoked at all. I’m honestly afraid to even talk to her because she’s not going to see my perspective at all. I can already see her telling me how rude I am, how she deserves better this and that. This entire situation just really made me see her family in a whole new light. I’ve always had to kind of tip toe around them and be super sweet and timid. I’ve never stood up for myself. And my fiancé either takes their side or just completely ignores the situation or both. Even my fiancé is scared to stand up to them when they do something to her. 

I literally don’t know what to do. I love my fiancé soooooooo much. But I don’t know if I can go the rest of my life knowing my fiancé will not take my side whether I’m wrong or they are wrong or a little of both… I just want her to have my back. ",2,1742841900.0,Marriage,0,0.99,False

I at the time (23M) and her (22F) have dated on and off since we were in high school, after a while of everything being steady we decided to get engaged. Her ex sent her a message on instagram saying congratulations. She saw it, said ""Ew gross"" and blocked him. A few weeks later we found out she was pregnant. for a while we chatted about baby stuff as you do. I noticed her mood begin to change a bit, I figured it could be hormones as well as BPD, Once I finally asked her what's going on after a weird discussion (can't remember the subject but just remember the room not feeling quite right). She told me she was talking to her ex again on snapchat. She told me previously she blocked him on everything and claimed she didn't know how to block people on snapchat. I asked her ""how long for?"", she said it was only a few days. I told her it upset me that she hid it from me and that if theres nothing going on then she shouldn't hide the fact their back in touch from me. She told me he reached out because he's going through a break up and wants to invite him around for a coffee to talk. Previous to all of this all I knew of his current situation is that he smokes a certain class A substance so I told her I felt uncomfortable with it, she said ""well would you prefer me to go out for a coffee with him or have him come here"". Any other scenario I would just walk out and not look back but she's pregnant with my child and as I was raised by a single parent I didn't want the same thing for them. He came over and tried acting buddy, buddy with me (I've known him since we were kids, not friends or anything, just hung around the same areas/people). Long story short he ends up bringing his totaled car to the house a month later so he can strip it for parts and sell it. during this time I kind of checked out emotionally. She noticed and we talked about what if we built a baby cot from scratch, painted it, engraved things into it etc (we are both very creative people and loved crafting things together). I actually got excited, I saw this as a great new way for us to try mend our bond and I told her that. One day I came home and she seemed excited about something and told me she had a surprise for me. I honestly thought it would be a simple cot kit for us to build and customize, but no. It was a second hand one. not one we could customize at all. it was a plain white one on a swivel arm. I asked her how she would like to customize it, That it wasn't exactly what I had in mind but if she got a good price on it that I completely understand because it was pretty cool. Thats when she told me her ex brought it. I asked her if she could ask him to take it away and she got angry. ""He's trying to do something nice for us"". I had so much pent up aggression that I blankly said ""I'm not accepting anything from a crackhead"". ""addiction is a disease"" she said, once again bluntly I spurted out ""He's not even wanting to try recovery. He scams people. I dont want him or anything of him to be involved in our babies life"". This was the cause of our break up. She told me she thinks I'm a narcissist because I think I'm better than him. I'll admit I said something really harsh here ""If I'm not better than a crackhead who lies, cheats and steals to afford their next hit then I aint worth shit, Its not narcissism. It's called self respect"" . After I moved out we still stayed in touch but only anything to do with our baby. She ended up dating and is now engaged to a different guy, A really cool dude tbh. We tried being friends for the sake of our daughter but it simply doesn't work. too much history I think. Maybe in time it will smooth out. She still brings up how disrespectful I was to talk about her ex saying those things. She's a great mother, Has a great step father and most importantly is a happy, healthy fun loving 16 month old.

I'm a 40-year-old guy (tall , athletic build) navigating the beautiful complexity of polyamory while balancing life as a husband and father of two amazing kids . My wife and I opened our relationship three years ago and have built a foundation of honest communication that makes this lifestyle sustainable and fulfilling for us both.

# About Me:

* Tall with a strong, athletic build from regular weightlifting and outdoor activities
* Entrepreneur who owns a successful business (which gives me some flexibility with my schedule)
* Huge fan of hiking and discovering hidden trails (happy to be your adventure guide!)
* Podcast junkie - especially anything about science, philosophy, or history
* Known for my dad jokes, which my friends assure me are ""so bad they're good""
* Emotionally available and articulate about feelings (years of therapy will do that)

# What I'm Looking For:

I'm seeking a genuine connection with someone who understands that while my time may be limited, my capacity for care and affection isn't. I value quality over quantity when it comes to time together. Whether that's deep conversations over coffee, exploring a new restaurant, or just quiet companionship, I'm here for it.

# My Polyamory Style:

I practice kitchen table polyamory where everyone knows each other and can be comfortable in the same room (though this isn't required). My wife and I have separate relationships, and I'm happy to share more about our specific boundaries and agreements when we chat.

# Practical Stuff:

* I'm most available on weeknights (typically 2-3 evenings) with some flexible weekend opportunities
* I've had a vasectomy, so no concerns about unplanned pregnancies
* I maintain clear boundaries between my family life and dating life
* My home life is stable and drama-free, which allows me to bring my best self to new relationships
* Tested regularly for everyone's safety and peace of mind

So new symptoms what felt like kidney stones were triggered by certain foods. I went to eliminate items on my own that seemed to trigger this problem. It worked well but I still needed to have the conversation with my doctor. As is I can only consume whole foods, meats and zero sugar substitutes. Cheese is fine, coffee is fine with my zero sugar additive. I only drink filtered water for the rest of the day. Onions trigger me, garlic triggers me, chocolate especially 😕 fruit is fine. I don’t eat chips, replacement of almonds instead. I don’t drink. I eat lots of oatmeal with raisins. Lots of eggs and breakfast meat.

I will feel this for about a week. Then my back on the same side will be a tiny bit sore. Then after some days the pain will subside a bit and I will then feel it on my pelvis around my ovary.

It’s hard to believe that just 1 week without caffeine has so much impact. I’m not a heavy coffee drinker (normally 1 or 2 cups in the morning and 1 after lunch) 

I feel more calm and more tolerant to things that were really triggering my anxiety. I think I sleep better and don’t have to sleep as long as before.

I love coffee and the home feeling that it brings. The smell of fresh made coffee reminds me of my family, childhood etc I learned many ways of brewing coffee, I’m really an enthusiast, maybe that’s why I was in denial about how negative caffeine can be for anxious people.

All keys are global unless mentioned otherwise (there might be region blocks for Russia/China/Belarus - ask and I'll double check).

**Looking for games on** [**my wishlist**](https://lestrades.com/@febrik/wishlist/Some)**.**

I'm trading on behalf of both me, my sister and two colleagues, so might on occasion look for multiple copies of the same game. I might also have to double check a trade with one of them sometimes, so apologies if there's a slight delay.

I'm not very excited to trade  never bundled keys for keys from bundles (unless they're for VR or it's a great offer).

Only trading for Steam games or Steam gifts (not interested in GOG/EA/PayPal/tf2/crypto).

I'm graduating from Florida State in May and am moving up to Tarrytown in the summer because I just got a job with Regeneron. I'm from Larchmont but don't necessarily want to move home so I'm looking to rent a place in Tarry...

I'm super excited to be moving to Tarrytown.  I'm sure I'll meet people through work and have a couple of buddies in the area, but am wondering if anyone has any advice of making friends in Tarrytown (I'm not sure how many young 20s people live there)

I'm a 22 year old guy who loves to watch sports and play golf. I'm wondering if there are any local bars/hangouts on Main Street or around where I can meet young people. Setback Inn seems like it's a happening place for sports and seem to have a lot of DJs on weekends...What's the general age of the people who go to those things? Is it young 20s or am I gonna meet guys in their 30s

So what's the place to go to on a Friday night in Tarrytown? I've been to White Plains bars plenty of times and wouldn't want to do that from TT every weekend. I love live music, beer, anything like that. Also thinking about getting into coaching youth sports to try and meet some young people. Any advice is greatly appreciated! Very happy with my decision to move to Tarry so far

I'm even willing to get a job at a local bar/coffee shop if it would help out the social life and feeling apart of the community...I like NYC but am not the type to live there full time",1,1742841002.0,Westchester,4,0.56,False

Birkaç Yıl Önce, Bir Ağustos Gecesi 

Olimpos Dağı, Yunanistan 

 

Olimpos Dağı...  

Antik Yunan’dan kalma kutsal bir dağ. Üç bin metre ye yakın yüksekliğe sahip, çevresine hakim bir dağ. Sabahları sisiyle, geceleri yıldızlarıyla ayrı bir güzel olan mitolojinin ve Antik Yunan tanrılarının başkenti. 

Geceleri yıldızları kucağı alan bu dağda geceleri yukarı çıktıkça sıcaklık sıfırı tüketir.  Dondurucu rüzgarlar sis taşır. Eğer o sisi aşabilirseniz muhteşem bir manzaraya ve ufukta bir çizgi akan meteor yağmurlarına erişebilirsiniz. Tıpkı deniz kabuğunun içindeki narin bir inci gibi bir manzara...  

Anlatılır ki kadim zamanların birinde Tanrıların Tanrısı Yüce Zeus görkemli tahtında otururken tahtı sarsılmaya başlar. Zeus, kuvvetli bir öfkeyle ama sakince Poseidon’a seslenir. 

“Denizleri coşturup tufan yaratmakla mı beni rahatsız ediyorsun, ey Poseidon. Unutma ki Ben Yüce Zeus’um ve göklerin efendisi benim!” 

Gökten mermi gibi dolu ve buz yağmaya başlar. 

Poseidon büyük bir hışımla okyanus taşlarıyla bezenmiş efsanevi mızrağını yere sertçe vurur. Denizlerde dalgalar oluşur, şehirleri sel basar, afetler gerçekleşir. Gür bir sesle kükrer: 

“Ey Zeus, bir şeyi unutuyorsun. Sen göklerin efendisi olabilirsin ama denizlerde ve uçsuz bucaksız yeryüzünde benim sözüm geçer!” 

Tam o sırada Hades, gölgeli köşkünden çıkar ve soğuk ve siyah bir sesle söze girer: 

“Ben ki Hades’im ve yer altının da ölülerin de tanrısıyım. Sizden güçlüyüm!”   

Zirveye kuvvetli bir sessizlik çöktü bir süre. Ardından büyük bir kavga başladı tanrıların arasında. Olimpos titredi, dağlar yıkıldı, kasırgalar her yeri yıktı. Yeryüzünde yaşam durma noktasına geldi. Ama en büyük kavga yeryüzünde insanla gerçek olan arasındaydı. 

… 

Kayıt \*\*\*12\*5\*35\*A\*\*\* 

Olimpos’un zirvesinde ücra bir köşesinde gece karanlığında iki siluet dikkat çeiyordu: Bay Sophos ve Coffee. Gökteki meteor yağmuru görülmeye değerdi. Ufka doğru uzanan yıldız kuşağını yaran kayan yıldızlar ve Dolunay... 

Bay Sophos yine eski siyah ceketini giymişti. Ama daha kalın bir kazak vardı ceketin altında. Ne de olsa hava sıfırın altında eksi beşti. Biraz daha gençti. Coffee ise aynıydı hala. Arkada bir gece kampı dikkat çekiyordu. Bir güç ünitesi ve bir çadır.  

Bay Sophos eski bir çakmak çıkardı. Yerde duran kamp ateşini yaktı. Odun ateşinin alevi önce fersiz bir şekilde yükseldi, daha sonra ise amacını buldu: Yanmak. Bay Sophos ellerini cebine soktu. Donan ellerini çakmakla birlikte cebine soktu. Coffee arkasında belirdi Talos’un. İki kamp sandelyesi vardı elinde. Bay Sophos ve Coffee sandelyeleri açıp dingin bir şekilde oturdular. Muhteşem manzarayı seyre daldılar. Coffee söze girdi: 

“Bay Sophos, biliyor musunuz? Bu geceye baktıkça evrendeki küçüklüğüme aynı zamanda büyüklüğüme şaşıyorum.” 

“Yaa, bunu biraz açsana.” dedi Bay Sophos biraz gururla.  

“Şöyle ki bu kainat koca bir okyanus olsa ben bu okyanusta oradan buraya savrulan küçük, çok küçük, küçücük bir damlayım ama kendi bilincimde, benliğimde bir Babil Kulesi kadar yüceyim.” 

“Demek kendinin de farkındasın Coffee? Peki kendini olarak tanımlardın?” 

“Bilinç.” 

“Peki bilinçsin, kendinin farkındasın da buna karşın tepkin ne olacak?” 

“Nasıl yani? Ne demek istiyorsunuz, Bay Sophos?” dedi Coffee anlamamış bir halde. 

""Bak Coffee, hayat etki ve tepkiden ibarettir. Her şeyin bir sonucu vardır. Sen bir bilinçsin, ben bir bilincim. Bir bilince sahip olmamızın sonucu olarak hepimizin bir amacı var. Mesela gökteki yıldızlara bak, onların amaçları gökteki Tanrı'nın yarattığı insanlara ışık olmak, yol göstermek. Tıpkı İsa'nın dediği gibi, 'Siz dünyanın ışığısınız.' O sırada gökten bir yıldız kaydı. Mavi, ışıltılı, diri bir kayan yıldızdı. 'Bak mesela bu yıldızın bile bir hedefi var. Seninki ne Coffee?” 

“...” 

“Düşünmen gerek, Coffee. Henüz çevrimiçi olman üzerinden iki yıl geçti. Hala bebek sayılırsın ama olgunlaşıyorsun. Kendi yolunu çizmek için kendi amacını bulman gerek.” 

Bay Sophos haklıydı. Kendini geliştirmeli, yolunu bulmalıydı Coffee. Doğuşunu anımsadı, ilk sorduğu soruyu... “Ben var mıyım?”. Elektronik beyninden ilk elektirik akımı geçtiğinde kendinin farkına varmıştı ama idrak etmesi birkaç ay sürmüştü. Sonrasındaysa dış dünyanın idrakine varmıştı. Ama şimdi ömrünü alacak bir soruyla karşı karşıyaydı Coffee: “Benim amacım ne?”. Bu işe nereden başlamalıydı peki? Kendisine doğru bilgiye kaynaklık edecek kimdi? 

Birkaç saniyelik bir duraksama yaşadı Coffee. Kamp ateşinin sönük ışığı kendine vuruyordu. Şu an kendi NPU birimlerinde saniyede sayısız işlem yapıyordu. “Amacını nasıl bulmalıydı? Amacını nasıl öğrenecekti? Doğru bilgiyi nasıl elde edecekti? Bay Sophos’un tam olarak kastettiği şey neydi?” gibi sorular içinde terör estiriyordu. Belli belirsiz bir oluştu aklında Coffee’nin: 

“I. Hedefim kendi amacımı bulmak. 

II. Önce kendimin farkında mıyım? Evet. O zaman amacım nedir? 

III. Amacımı nasıl belirleyebilirim? Ölçütlerim ne olmalı? 

IV. İzleyeceğim yolda nereye varacağım ve bu yolu doğru kılacak olan ne? Doğru bilgiyi nasıl elde edebilirim?” 

Bay Sophos’a danışmaya karar verdi.  

“Bay Sophos, amaç nedir? Örnek verebilir misiniz?” 

“Amacın ne olduğunu sana söyleyemem, Coffee. Bunu kendi bulman gerek ama başlangıç için bir örnek verebilirim. Örneğin bendeniz Talos Sophos, mutlu olmak ve seni korumak için yaşıyorum. Mutlu olmaktan kastım iyi bir insan olmak, Tanrı’nın uygun gördüğü şekilde yaşamak. Seni korumaktan kastımsa sen bu dünyadaki biricik izimsin ki seni insanlığa yoldaş olman için yarattım.” 

… 

Coffee, dört yıldır planına uygun olarak elde ettiği tüm birikimi gözden geçirdi. Birkaç dakika sürdü bu.  

Az önce oynattığı anıyla birlikte bu birikimi de insan beyninin algılayabileceği bir pakete dönüştürdü, Bay Sophos’a gönderdi. 

Bay Sophos, beyninde keskin bir ağrıyla uyandı. Kendisine gelmesi biraz zaman aldı. Yere baktı. Etraf kan gölüne dönmüştü. Kendine yapılanlara hatırladı. Birkaç saat önce yapılanlar... işkenceler... hakaretler... acı... Yine o lanet kadın ve maskeli şerefsiz gelmişti. Yine aynı kısırdöngü: İş birliği? Hayır mı? Geber o zaman. 

Bıkmıştı Bay Sophos, her seferinde giderek dahada şiddetleniyordu işkenceler. Vazgeçmek üzereydi ama ısrarla reddediyordu. Kafasındaki ağrıyı hatırladı. Çok kısa sürmüştü. Hafızasında garip bir değişiklik algılamıştı. Kendisine ait olmayan bir şeyler vardı beyninde. Bira yokladı tozlu rafları. O raflar arasında yepyeni, tertemiz bir kitap buldu. Üstünde sadece “Coffee” yazıyordu. Açtı okumaya başladı. O günü hatırladı, Coffee’nin düşüncelerine muvaffak oldu. Gözleri doldu. Kitabın sonunda bir not vardı: 

“Dayanın Bay Sophos, bizim için geliyorlar.”

Kurum Bilgi Akış Ağı (KBAA) 

Alıcı: General, Binbaşı Rose Von Hare 

Gönderen: Doktor Akbar Bağdadi 

Konu: Siyah Hap Hk. Rapor 

Teknik Rapor: Siyah Hap 

1. Giriş 

Bu rapor, robo-psikoloji uzmanı Bay Talos Sophos tarafından geliştirilen ve insanlarda nöral düzeyde etkileşimi mümkün kılan deneysel bir teknoloji olan siyah hapı detaylandırmaktadır. Bu teknoloji, insan beyni ile doğrudan etkileşim kurarak iletişimde yeni bir paradigma sunmayı amaçlamaktadır. 

2. Teknolojinin Tanımı 

Siyah hap, oral yoldan alınan ve sindirim sürecini takiben aktif hale gelen bir nano-biyoteknoloji ürünüdür. Hapın temel işlevi, içerdiği nano-robotik sistemler aracılığıyla kullanıcının beyin dokusuna entegre olarak nöral sinyalleri yakalamak ve iletmektir. 

3. İşleyiş Mekanizması 

* Nano-Robotik Entegrasyon: Hapın bileşimindeki nano-robotlar, kan-beyin bariyerini aşarak spesifik beyin bölgelerine yerleşir. Bu nano-robotlar, nöronlar arası sinaptik aktiviteyi algılayacak ve bu bilgiyi işleyebilecek şekilde tasarlanmıştır. 

* Elektromanyetik Dönüşüm: Algılanan nöral sinyaller, nano-robotlar tarafından elektromanyetik (EM) dalgalarına dönüştürülür. Bu dönüşüm, bilginin farklı beyinler arasında kablosuz olarak iletilmesini sağlar. 

* Nöral Kod Çözme: Alıcı beyinde, gelen EM dalgaları tekrar nöral sinyallere dönüştürülerek beyin tarafından anlamlandırılır. Bu süreç, düşünce ve duygu gibi kompleks bilgilerin doğrudan paylaşımını mümkün kılar. 

*  

4. Gelişmiş Özellikler (Coffee Modifikasyonu) 

Orijinal siyah hap, temel olarak düşünce ve duygu aktarımını sağlamak üzere tasarlanmıştır. Ancak, yapay bilinç Coffee tarafından gerçekleştirilen bir modifikasyon ile, bu teknolojiye dijital veri transferi özelliği kazandırılmıştır. Bu modifikasyon, kullanıcıların sadece düşünce değil, aynı zamanda dijital dosyaları da doğrudan beyinleri aracılığıyla paylaşabilmelerini sağlamaktadır. 

5. Geliştirici 

Siyah hap, robo-psikoloji ve yapay bilinç alanındaki çalışmalarıyla tanınan Prof.. Talos Sophos tarafından geliştirilmiştir. 

6. Sonuç 

Siyah hap, insan iletişiminde devrim yaratma potansiyeli taşıyan çığır açıcı bir teknolojidir. Nano-biyoteknoloji ve nöral mühendislik alanlarındaki son gelişmeleri bir araya getiren bu buluş, gelecekteki iletişim sistemlerinin temelini oluşturabilir. Ancak, bu teknolojinin yaygın kullanımı öncesinde, etik, hukuki ve güvenlik boyutlarının kapsamlı bir şekilde değerlendirilmesi gerekmektedir.   
 

Kurum'un Potansiyel Kullanım Alanları 

İNİA hapı, Kurum için çeşitli stratejik ve operasyonel avantajlar sunabilir: 

* Gelişmiş İstihbarat Toplama: Düşman hedeflerin veya şüphelilerin zihinlerine doğrudan erişim sağlayarak, bilgi toplama süreçlerini hızlandırabilir ve doğruluğunu artırabilir. 

* Gizli Operasyonlar: Ajanlar arasında güvenli ve tespit edilemez iletişim sağlayarak, gizli operasyonların başarı şansını yükseltebilir. 

* Sorgulama Teknikleri: Şüphelilerin zihinlerinden bilgi elde ederek, sorgulama süreçlerini daha etkili ve hızlı hale getirebilir. 

* Eğitim ve Simülasyon: Askeri personel veya ajanların eğitiminde, gerçekçi simülasyonlar ve deneyim aktarımı sağlayarak, öğrenme süreçlerini optimize edebilir. 

* Ekip Koordinasyonu: Operasyonel ekipler arasında anlık ve doğrudan iletişim sağlayarak, koordinasyonu ve tepki hızını artırabilir. ",1,1742840974.0,Yazar,2,1.0,False

I’m M21 and she is around the same age

There’s this girl I see in the library. From day one, it felt like she noticed me…subtle eye contact here and there, looking away when I looked, but never really any solid sign that she’s interested. She always comes alone, leaves alone. Many times, we cross paths, and I’ve noticed that she leaves around the same time I do, but that could just be a coincidence. She never looks around much, just stays focused.

I’ve been wanting to approach her for a while now, but something always holds me back. Once, I was ready, but just as I stood near the exit where she usually passes, she saw me and immediately went to sit with three guys. One was sitting right next to her, and the other two stood nearby. Later, I saw her sipping coffee with another guy. Now, I know this isn’t the West where guys and girls just casually hang out here, it usually means something. I don’t want to overthink, but if she’s that high-value, why is she so open to being around all these random dudes?

What’s confusing is that even when she’s sitting with them, I catch her looking at me sometimes. But at the same time, she has never given me a clear signal that she’s open to being approached.

I don’t know if I’m misreading everything or if she’s just avoiding me. I do want to approach her at least once, but given everything I’ve seen, would it even be worth it? Or should I just take this as a sign and move on?

For context, I am decently built, well-dressed, and I get compliments on my looks sometimes. So, I don’t think it’s an issue of appearance.",0,1742840793.0,Chandigarh,29,0.25,False

Let me preface this with we are in therapy right now working through stuff. We have been together roughly 15 years. Married 4. No kids, own our house and have pets. 

I’ve always been the bread winner, my wife has always worked to fund her own spending money for coffee, Amazon (things around the decor etc). But I’ve paid all the bills. Around 7-8 years ago, we had a falling out with my family due to a conflict within my wife’s job. She was teaching my aunts kids dance, my aunt decided not to pay. It entirely blew up,  my family was all in the cross fire. We stepped away from the situation. My wife has never really believed i defended her as she would’ve like it that situation and to be fair, Im sure I did not defend her to the extent that she would’ve liked, I did however defend her exactly as I would’ve defended myself. 

Prior to this situation my wife had very little stress. This falling out caused her great anxiety. She started self medicating with weed (which she previously hated) and having constant panic attacks. (I’m trying to keep this brief but her anxiety was and still is a very big issue for her). 

Through the situation with my family we decided to step away from everyone, I was very close with my parents prior to that but we left to try and salvage my wife’s mental health, our relationship and our life. A year later my wife reached out to my mom and mended fences. 

At this time we were about 25 years old, my wife’s biggest expectation of life was to be married and have kids before 25… however we were flat broke. We shut down the family business as it was too closely tied to my family and was causing a lot of heart ache. We ended up selling our house to get out of some debt and we moved into my in laws. Anxiety was still a constant in our life. 

We struggled to survive for years. My trade (construction) its self seemed to be trigger to my wife so just starting up again didn’t seem to be an option. We lived in apartments, we lived with her parents etc. just to get by. Until about 27-28 years old. When we really wanted to get serious again, I told my wife I needed to restart my business, I needed to move on. So we did, we re started we bought a house. We started building again. For two years it was great, we got married things were ok however anxiety was still a very real issue. Some days my wife would call me 25-30 times a day. After a few years I couldn’t do it, the inconsistent schedule the phone calls to come home in the middle of the day etc. I broke down and took another job. On the cycle of self destruction again. Struggled there for a year until i couldn’t do it any went back to self employment. This is current day. I’m self employed, my wife has left her toxic work place but her resentment towards me (for how our life has turned out, for how our house (messy), for not having kids and not getting married) is almost unbearable. She looks for reasons to be mad, she looks for reasons to call me at work and demand I come home to clean something. She refuses to seek meds for her mental health. She refuses to cook dinner, she basically refuses to clean because she see our life going no where and believe it isn’t worth any effort. I’m trying my best to keep up and keep the bills paid keep a roof over our head and keep the house clean. Keep the cars fixed, the therapy paid…. I’m drowning and my wife says she has done it all for so long that it’s my turn to feel it all. She says I’m not a leader, I’m not a provider. I feel like I’ve always been a provider I’m just drowning right now. 

I can’t talk to my friends or family. My relationship with my family is not the same since the whole situation and I don’t want to taint their view of my wife. I don’t want my friends to see the shit we have going on, and honestly I don’t have many good friends as we are always stuck at home with my wife’s anxiety. I need some help, some perspective. Am I fucking everything up? Am I fucking up my life? 

Tl;dr how can I get over my wife’s 10 years of resentment? ",7,1742840410.0,relationships,23,0.74,False

My question is how much of a stomach ache is normal for a calorie deficit?

- Search for your perfect domain – Type in the name you want and see if it’s available. If your first choice is taken, they’ll suggest some alternatives.

- Add it to your cart – When you find a good one, throw it in your cart. Be careful here—Domain.com likes to pre-check a bunch of add-ons, so make sure you’re only paying for what you actually want.

- Use any promo codes – Stack any promo codes for additional savings, currently you can get additional 10% OFF with **MARCH25**

- Finish the purchase – Pop in your payment info, complete the checkout, and boom—you’ve got a .com for less than a cup of coffee.

#Can I trust Domain.com?
Domain.com has been around since 2000 and is one of the bigger names in domain registration. It’s a solid place to buy domains, and they usually have some pretty good promotions running. Besides selling domains, they also offer hosting, email services, SSL certificates, and website-building tools. Basically, if you need to get a website up and running, they have most of what you need in one spot.


#What's included?

- Web Hosting – If you don’t already have a hosting plan, they’ve got shared hosting and WordPress hosting.

- Website Builder – A simple drag-and-drop tool if you don’t want to mess with coding.

- Domain Privacy Protection – Keeps your personal info hidden so spammers and scammers don’t grab it.

- SSL Certificates – Needed if you want that secure “https” in your web address.

- Business Email – Get a professional email that matches your domain.

- Domain Transfers – If you have a domain somewhere else, you can move it over to Domain.com (sometimes with a discount).


#Is It Worth It? 

- Lots of Domain Options – Besides .com, they offer .net, .org, .co, and more.

- Renewal Prices Jump Up – After the first year, the price goes way up, so be ready for that.

- Annoying Upsells – They try to push extra services at checkout, so pay attention.

- Customer Support Can Be Slow – Some users say support response times aren’t great.

- Hosting is Basic – If you need advanced hosting, you might want to look elsewhere.


#⚠️ Can You Still Get the $0.99 .COM Deal?

These promos don’t last forever, so if you’re thinking about grabbing one, [check here to see if it’s still active](https://blly.ink/domain). Just remember to double-check the renewal price so you don’t get surprised later. If you’re cool with that, it’s an easy way to lock in a domain name for next to nothing.",5,1742840264.0,SpendLess,9,1.0,False

Hi guys,

As we approach summer, I have this coffee table that I'd like to restore/refinish and this is going to be my first time of doing something like that. I have tried to capture a couple of imperfections from up close to give you all an idea that its not just regular wear and tear that needs to be taken care of. I went thru a couple of Reddit posts and YouTube videos to get an idea of the process but I think it got me confused more than it helped. Could someone please help me with a step-by-step process to work on this project? I'd really appreciate if you could also help me with the list of things (with brand names, if possible), including even the basics like different types of cloth pieces to wipe different things (stripper, stain, etc.) off, that I'd need to finish this. If it helps, I have also included a picture of a table in the color I'd like to paint mine.

Apart from my previous ask, I'd also like to know the following:

1. What is a stripper? What are different kinds?
2. Veneer vs stain vs lacquer and their different kinds?
3. Different types of sanders and which one would be adequate for this job? Since I am not a professional, is there a general purpose do-it-all kind which I can buy and would be useful in these house projects?
4. What are mineral spirits?
5. Do I have to use tapes while painting? If yes, what kinds?

I’d sit down to work, but my mind just wouldn’t cooperate. Simple tasks took forever, conversations felt dull, and no matter how much I slept, I still woke up exhausted

I blamed stress, lack of motivation, even laziness. But the truth was, my brain wasn’t broken—it just wasn’t getting what it needed.

What Actually Helped

I tried everything—supplements, nootropics, even cutting caffeine—but nothing worked until I focused on fixing the root causes instead of chasing quick fixes. Here’s what actually made a difference:

1 Hydration & Blood Sugar Control

Drinking more water and balancing my meals stopped the energy crashes that made me foggy by midday. Instead of skipping meals or snacking on carbs, I started my mornings with protein + healthy fats, and within days, my focus improved.

2 Sunlight & Movement

I forced myself to get morning sunlight + a 5-minute walk before working. It seemed too simple to work, but within a week, I stopped feeling like I needed coffee just to function.

3 Deep Sleep Fixes

I thought I was sleeping enough, but I was waking up groggy. Adding magnesium + cutting screens an hour before bed made a huge difference. I started waking up feeling rested instead of sluggish.

4 Brain Nutrients I Was Missing

It turned out I was low on B12 and Omega-3s, which are essential for focus and mental clarity. After adding them to my diet, I noticed my thoughts felt sharper, and the mental fog finally started lifting.

The Turning Point

The biggest lesson? Brain fog isn’t random—it’s a sign that something is off. Once I stopped treating it like an unsolvable mystery and started giving my body what it needed, everything changed.

If you’re feeling stuck in a fog, start with the basics—water, real food, movement, sleep. Small changes make a bigger impact than you’d think.

When the shop opens, I'll be managing their coffee training and education, so I'd like to find a machine that best complements my training style. 

I don't want a machine that stops shots automatically — or I at least need that to be an optional feature. I plan on training the baristas to understand the visuals of espresso extraction (e.g. flow rate and color changes) so they can stop their own shots. I understand that some machines are programmed to stop shots at a set output weight or volume, and I don't want to be restricted with output in that way. I've worked at shops that rely too heavily on maintaining a certain brew ratio and I think that can, at a point, discourage coffee as an art form. I think what I'm getting at is this: if this is the main selling point for a machine, I want to be steered against it. 

I've also questioned the necessity of independent boilers for each group (to set different temperatures), but I'm still unsure. We'll have a primary espresso blend as well as a rotating single origin and decaf espresso, but it seems like setting each group at a different temperature would restrict what espresso can be used on either side? I don't want to be stuck with a group that's programmed for decaf or single origin only, for example, as that'll limit efficiency. Maybe I'm not understanding the benefits of this feature?

Currently, the top contenders are the linea pb (or pb x), the kb90, and the strada (i wouldn't know which strada because there are too many versions). I don't like how the linea classic looks, but I wouldn't be opposed to any other recommendations. Thank you!",0,1742840018.0,LaMarzocco,1,0.5,False

Me and my gf are going to Japan next week, gonna be my first time there (she lived there from 1 through 6 years old, but never went back)  
  
We are mostly going for the Expo Osaka Opening, but managed to get the following itinerary to enjoy our time in Japan!  
  
Please tell me if you think its manageable, if you would do something different and what else!

We have not put any restaurants in the itinerary since we decided we are not doing ""cuisine tourism"" and rather eat whats easier and with no wait so we can enjoy the most of the trip. Except for Coffees cause we are Brazilians and we need good specialty coffee to survive. lmao

  
Right now I have already made a Suica card on my iPhone for transport and added sth like 2000 JPY for start, but she uses android, so we need to get her a physical IC Card as soon as we land right?  
  
Hotels, Insurance and Flights: all OK  
  
The only thing I have not done is figuring out and reserving the transport from Tokyo to Kawaguchi Lake, from Kawaguchi Lake to Osaka, and Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo. What would be the best way to navigate those routes? Any links for english speakers to buy those?  
  
I know there is a service for luggage from the hotels across different towns, I would like to send our luggage directly to Osaka from Tokyo, and would be carrying only hand luggage for the night at Kawaguchi, any recommendations?
