Vulcan Elements, a rare earth magnet maker based in North Carolina, US, has entered a supply agreement with Indiana-based ReElement Technologies to procure critical minerals sourced from outside China, according to a [*Reuters*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/vulcan-elements-signs-rare-earths-supply-deal-with-reelement-technologies-2025-08-18/) report.

The privately held companies did not reveal the specific financial details of the transaction.

However, it is said that Vulcan Elements will purchase the rare earths outside of China at a price “significantly below” the $110/kg floor guaranteed by the US Department of Defense to MP Materials.

ReElement Technologies has attributed its competitive pricing to the use of chromatography in processing, a technique that sets it apart from the solvent extraction method commonly employed in the industry.

Licensing its technology from Purdue University, ReElement will supply Vulcan with “thousands of metric tonnes” of rare earth oxides annually for five years, starting in 2026, sourced from outdated electronics or mine sites.

ReElement Technologies CEO Mark Jensen was quoted as saying: “We are laser focused on cost. We will see where the market goes, but right now we are focused more on the market price versus that price floor.”

The contract, signed in mid-July, positions Vulcan Elements to be more competitive on the worldwide stage, according to the company’s CEO John Maslin.

“This pricing will enable Vulcan to be competitive in global markets,” he stated. “We wanted to make sure the unit economics made sense.”

The news of this deal follows reports that the Trump administration may extend the price floor to other companies, a topic discussed in a closed-door meeting in Washington attended by both Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies.

ReElement Technologies recently [established commercial protocols](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/reelement-technologies-develops-protocols/) for extracting ultra-high-purity germanium from recycled materials and ore-based feedstocks.

# AUGUST 18th, 2025~DOE Announces 4 New Critical Minerals Funding Opportunities

[DOE Announces 4 New Critical Minerals Funding Opportunities | Insights | Holland & Knight](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/08/doe-announces-4-new-critical-minerals-funding-opportunities)

# Highlights

* *The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched four new funding initiatives totaling nearly $1 billion to expand domestic critical minerals production, processing, recycling and supply chain resilience, with heightened restrictions on foreign entities of concern (FEOCs).*
* *Programs span awards of $50 million to $500 million across battery materials, byproduct recovery, rare earth elements and technology acceleration, focusing on late-stage, market-ready projects aligned with the Trump Administration's energy dominance agenda.*
* *Applicants should begin preparing now by completing registrations, assessing FEOC exposure, forming academic and industry partnerships, and defining commercialization pathways to align with DOE priorities. Holland & Knight has extensive experience guiding clients through prior funding rounds and can help position projects to compete effectively in this cycle*

[It appears the DoE is back in Business & NioCorp \\""might\\"" qualify for some of the funding initiatives mentioned below?](https://reddit.com/link/1mue9xb/video/0bfzwnah4yjf1/player)

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) on Aug. 13, 2025, unveiled four major funding initiatives aimed at accelerating the domestic production, processing and recycling of critical minerals and materials. Collectively, these planned Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) represent nearly $1 billion in potential federal investment to fortify U.S. supply chains, advance energy dominance and reduce reliance on foreign entities of concern (FEOCs).

At the center of the announcements is the $500 million Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program – the third competitive funding round under Section 40207 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and first Section 40207 solicitation to be issued under the Trump Administration's DOE. Flanking this opportunity are three additional notices of intent (NOIs) that address other critical supply chain gaps, from rare earth element demonstration to byproduct recovery and mid-stage technology acceleration.

# 1. Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing and Recycling NOI

* **Agency:** DOE Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC)
* **Anticipated Funding:** up to $500 million
* **Award Size:** $50 million to $200 million
* **Performance Period:** 24 to 48 months
* **Cost Share:** to be specified in the NOFO; previous rounds required at least 50 percent nonfederal cost share for for-profit applicants

This flagship program will support demonstration- and commercial-scale projects that process, recycle or manufacture critical minerals and materials, including lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, aluminum and rare earth elements. Applicants must identify domestic downstream customers and will receive priority if they commit to 1) avoiding material sourced from FEOCs and 2) not exporting recovered materials to FEOCs. DOE's May 2024 [interpretive rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/06/2024-08913/interpretation-of-foreign-entity-of-concern) defines FEOCs and will be a central compliance consideration.

# How This Round Compares to Previous Funding Rounds

DOE has held two prior competitive funding rounds under Section 40207:

* **Round 1 (2022).** $1.82 billion to 14 projects to build and expand commercial-scale facilities for battery materials extraction, processing, component manufacturing and recycling
* **Round 2 (2023-2024).** More than $3 billion to 25 projects in 14 states to retrofit, expand and build new facilities for battery-grade processed critical minerals, component manufacturing, battery manufacturing and recycling

The third round maintains the focus on commercial-scale, near-term deployment but narrows in on critical minerals processing and derivative manufacturing with heightened FEOC restrictions and explicit alignment to the Trump Administration's energy dominance agenda. With fewer total dollars available than in prior rounds and awards ranging from $50 million to $200 million, the NOI suggests DOE is looking to back a smaller portfolio of late-stage, market-ready projects capable of advancing administration priorities quickly and visibly.

# 2. Critical Minerals and Materials Accelerator (NOI)

* **Agency:** DOE Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO)
* **Anticipated Funding:** up to $50 million
* **Performance Period:** one to four years

This program will foster industry-led partnerships to prototype and pilot processing technologies currently proven only at the bench scale. Focus areas include:

* rare earth magnet supply chain processes, including from secondary sources
* refining/alloying gallium, gallium nitride, germanium and silicon carbide for semiconductor use
* cost-competitive direct lithium extraction and separation
* co-production technologies to recover critical materials from byproducts and scrap

Selected projects will advance toward domestic commercialization within three to seven years, leveraging DOE investments such as the Critical Materials Innovation Hub and the Minerals to Materials Supply Chain Research Facility (METALLIC). A Teaming Partner List will be available to help applicants form consortia.

# 3. Mines and Metals Capacity Expansion – Piloting Byproduct Recovery (NOI)

* **Agency:** DOE Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM)
* **Anticipated Funding:** \~$250 million total
* **Cost Share:** 20 percent to 50 percent
* **Technical Readiness:** TRL 5-6 to TRL 7

This program targets pilot-scale facilities that recover valuable critical minerals and materials from existing industrial processes. Topic areas include:

* **coal-based industry pilots** ($75 million total; maximum three awards)
* **all-industry pilots** ($175 million total; maximum seven awards)

Eligible feedstocks include coal waste, mine tailings, industrial byproducts and specialty metal process streams. Target products include cobalt, nickel, magnesium, manganese, gallium, germanium, lithium and rare earth elements. Applicants must present a commercialization plan for 2028 to 2030.

# 4. Rare Earth Elements Demonstration Facility (NOI)

* **Agency:** DOE MESC
* **Anticipated Funding:** up to $135 million
* **Cost Share:** at least 50 percent
* **Other Requirements:** academic partner required

This initiative will fund the design, construction and operation of a demonstration-scale facility to extract, separate and refine rare earth elements from unconventional feedstocks such as acid mine drainage, mine waste, e-waste or deleterious materials. The goal is to establish the commercial viability of U.S.-based rare earth element production while reducing dependence on foreign sources.

# 5. ARPA-E RECOVER Program (Award Selections Forthcoming)

Though not a NOFO, DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) will soon announce awardees under its $40 million Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters (RECOVER) program. RECOVER aims to develop energy-efficient, scalable technologies to extract ammonia and critical metals from domestic wastewater – including streams from agriculture, mining, and oil and gas operations. The program's goal is to replace up to 50 percent of domestic ammonia supplies and 100 percent of certain key critical metals using waste-derived sources while creating new revenue opportunities for wastewater treatment facilities and reducing environmental impacts.

# What's Next?

DOE is expected to release these NOFOs in the coming months. To prepare, potential applicants should:

1. complete required registrations (Infrastructure Exchange, System for Award Management (SAM), FedConnect and [Grants.gov](http://Grants.gov) for alerts)
2. assess supply chain exposure to FEOCs and develop mitigation strategies
3. identify partners – academic, industrial and supply chain – especially for programs with explicit teaming requirements
4. define commercialization pathways consistent with program timelines and administration priorities

Holland & Knight will continue to monitor DOE announcements and stands ready to help position projects for success in this competitive funding round. Interested applicants with potential projects should contact the authors to discuss opportunity fit, timeline and next steps.

**Highlights**

* **First Blast Successfully and Safely Completed**
* **Excavation of Weathered Material & Construction of Test Mine Underway**
* **Bulk sample collection initiated for processing optimization & demonstration plant ore stockpile**

DENVER, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **American Rare Earths (ASX: ARR | OTCQX: ARRNF | ADR: AMRRY)** (**“ARR”** or the **“Company”**), through its subsidiary Wyoming Rare (USA) Inc. (“**WRI**”), has commenced construction of a test mine at the Cowboy State Mine (**“CSM”**), part of the Halleck Creek deposit, under its State of Wyoming License to Explore by Dozing.

The test mining program will extract approximately 3,200 tonnes of ore, which will serve as feedstock for a demonstration plant. The collection of bulk samples will also support ongoing mineral processing optimization work.

The first of two scheduled blasts was safely executed, fracturing weathered material to a depth of approximately 3.6 metres below the surface. This material will be excavated and stockpiled over the next week (see Figure 1 & 2). Once removed, the underlying non-weathered ore will be exposed, blasted and crushed on-site to a top size of approximately 5 centimeters.

**The crushed ore will be used for:**

* Metallurgical testing and process optimization;
* Building a stockpile for the demonstration plant; and
* Producing samples for potential offtake partners.

# AUGUST 18th, 2025~NioCorp Names New Senior VP of Business Development

[NioCorp Names New Senior VP of Business Development](https://mailchi.mp/niocorp.com/niocorp-names-new-senior-vp-of-business-development?e=9a305b2ac9)

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

*My Speculations given all recent events-*

# NioCorp is entering a pivotal moment where multiple high-impact catalysts are aligning to create what can only be described as a “Perfect Storm” setup.

*Internally, the company just completed its Phase I drilling program with assay results expected within weeks — results that are anticipated to significantly increase the resource estimate for rare earths (TREO), scandium, niobium, and titanium. These upgrades could dramatically enhance project economics and further validate the Elk Creek Project as a premier U.S. source for multiple critical minerals. The expiration of executive lock-up agreements and the unlocking of Class B shares signal that insiders may be preparing for a positive news cycle,* ***while the recent hiring of Ernest Cleave — a veteran in mining finance and development — shows NioCorp is gearing up for business execution, project financing, and institutional engagement.***

*At the same time, external forces are adding unprecedented momentum. The Department of Defense, National Defense Stockpile, and EXIM Bank are all confirmed to be in discussions with NioCorp, with scandium — vital for aerospace and defense alloys — attracting particular attention. The 2023 and 2024 NDAAs include NioCorp’s core minerals, and an upcoming DoD meeting in mid-September could introduce pricing support mechanisms or offtake agreements that further derisk the project. The Department of Energy also has $1 billion in funding available to support domestic critical minerals projects, and NioCorp is well-positioned to qualify once its updated DFS and resource numbers are confirmed later in 2025.*

***Together, these internal and external catalysts point to a high-probability inflection point between now and Q4 2025.*** *With resource upgrades, federal policy alignment, and commercial interest converging, NioCorp is poised to move from speculative junior to strategically indispensable U.S. critical minerals supplier. The next few weeks could represent the last low-visibility window before major news and institutional recognition drive a revaluation.*

# If execution matches current trajectory, NioCorp may emerge as the flagship American producer of Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and Rare Earths — reshaping domestic supply chains and establishing itself as a cornerstone of U.S. resource independence by 2028.

[See for yourserlf....](https://preview.redd.it/t34gbacr8yjf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a472249b9259d35c4d29086ee0f2e1b8bb887056)

**In short, NioCorp is not just a magnet play —** it’s the leading U.S.-based, multi-mineral supplier capable of reshaping strategic supply chains from the ground up. As geopolitical tensions rise and industrial policies shift toward resilience and traceability, NioCorp’s integrated model offers a compelling solution: domestic critical mineral production, full compliance, diversified output, and near-term scalability. If execution matches trajectory,

**NioCorp will be indispensable to the U.S. industrial base and a linchpin in the global race for material dominance by 2028 and beyond**.

a few of our friends in Cobble Hill and park slope have a structure with their walkers where they pay $40 a day regardless of if it’s 2 short walks just so the pup can go the the bathroom (spaced about 4 hour apart) or one longer 2 hour period where their dog is attended to (taken out, sitting at a coffee shop, whatever) 

This would work perfectly for us since our pup can be alone for about 4 hours at a time while we’re both working. 

Has anyone found this structure in north bk or have our friends miraculously hit the jackpot? 

Meanwhile the Rover walker minimum is 30 mins for usually $25-$30. Many of them don’t even take the dog out for that length, just until they pee but you’re still charged the full amount.

A feeling of unease washed over me, but I brushed it off, thinking he was merely sharing a coffee with the parents while the kids were at school. I decided to pull over, hoping for a pleasant surprise.

As I approached the front door, a chilling realization gripped me—it wasn't the cheerful conversation I had imagined. Instead, the unmistakable sounds of their passion resonating from the mom’s bedroom as they were having sex met me in the hallway. My heart shattered into a million pieces as I stood frozen, grappling with disbelief and devastation. The moment felt surreal, and as I stumbled back to my car, the world around me blurred into a haze of confusion. My phone, which had been a lifeline for capturing the truth, was broken—not that it mattered at that moment. 

In the following days, I purchased a new phone, holding onto a flicker of hope that I might catch them together again. When I finally confronted him about the infidelity that consumed my thoughts, his reaction was a tempest of denial. ""With whom?"" he demanded, his eyes narrowing in anger. Before I could think, I blurted out another mom’s name, and his fury erupted. He was insulted, he insisted, demanding an apology as if my words were a betrayal. He wanted to see proof, like pictures or a video. Each time I breached the subject, naming someone else, his response was the same—rage and a demand for an apology, while I felt the walls close in around me.

We continued navigating the social landscape of our children's lives, arranging seemingly innocent playdates, but I knew they hid their secrets behind their laughter. It felt like a cruel game as they managed to slip away into the corn maze—lost together in a place intended for family fun, but now tainted with my fears, which is just one example. 

As time dragged on, I could feel the air between us thickening with unspoken tension. My boyfriend grew increasingly critical, his words sharp as knives, slicing into my self-worth. ""Everybody hates you,"" he would spit during our arguments, leaving me to wrestle with my despair. I teetered on the brink of hopelessness in the darkest moments, contemplating the unthinkable. But somehow, I discovered a way to harden my heart, numbing myself to his cruelty, and thankfully, the urge to end it all began to fade.

Years passed, and the weight of unresolved feelings bore down on me. After a sleepless stretch of four days, delirium set in, and I confronted my boyfriend again without any proof. His response was a simmering rage, yet it lacked the expected intensity. He simply dismissed my words, not mentioning any insult this time, only retreating to kick me out of the bed like an unwanted stranger.

Last night, in a desperate attempt to reconnect, we tried to bridge the chasm that had formed between us, but it proved futile. His body betrayed him, and we had to cease our intimate moment as he lost his erection, the silence heavy and awkward in the room.

Now, I am at a crossroads, seeking advice and venting my frustrations to free myself from this emotional prison. I refuse to let this consume me any longer.",1,1755598050.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

# About

35 M, a bit of history of running in high school but nothing sensational. Started again in 2019, took a two-year hiatus in 2021 and 2022, joined a running club in 2023 and picked up training more seriously this year, hiring our club coach as personal coach.

PBs at the end of 2024 were 19:58 for the 5k, 1:31:07 for the HM and 3:17:12 for the marathon.

# Training

This year I decided to take my training more seriously, and I hired our club coach; a typical training week would usually look like this:

* 1 long run
* 1 medium/long run (usually around 90 mins)
* 2 quality sessions (fartlek, threshold, intervals etc)
* the rest of the days usually easy/recovery runs (or rest)

Topping up at around 100km (60 miles), but averaging closer to 85km (\~53 miles) per week.

I also supplement with strength training (once a week, but increasing it to two times per week now), and I recently started incorporating some very easy pool swimming (I am a terrible swimmer) on easy run days.

My main goal for this year is the Dublin Marathon (end of October) so all training is ultimately focused on that; with my coach we decided to spend the winter/spring months focusing on shorter distances, then transition to longer distance, race a half marathon (this one) and finally focus on Dublin.

As part of this training, I lowered by 5k PB from 19:58 to 18:29 first, and 17:02 later in the year. I also ran my first two 10k ever, finishing in 38:10 and 36:08 respectively.

# Pre-race

Coming into this race, I knew that, in normal circumstances, I would crush my old PB of 1:31:07 (I went sub-90 during a long progression run in training...) but the real question was how to pace myself. I knew on a good day I had a change to sub 1:20, but the forecast was for a warm day (low 20sC/70s F, which is not warm for most people but for me, living and training in Ireland, it certainly is), the course had a few rolling hills (which, spoiler alerts, turned out to work in my favour), and I was very likely to run alone for long stretches of time. Given all of this, we decided with my coach that I would have started at around 3:55/high 3:50s and then re-evaluate as the race progressed.

However, as you can see from the split, following a strategy is not my strongest suit :)

# Race

The morning of the race was pretty standard: wake up at 7am, have my usual breakfast (cup of coffee, porridge with chocolate, yogurt and half a banana). Drive to the race, go to the toilets way more times than needed, a quick 20 min warm-up (10 mins easy pace, followed by a gentle progression into HM pace), and a few drills.

With 5 mins to go, I positioned myself at the front of the starting area, and here we go!

As the race started, the leaders pretty clearly split in 3: one lone guy created a \~10 seconds gap in the first few 100 meters, and it was followed by a group of chasers (me included) and a second group behind, which would eventually start to fragment into smaller groups/single runners (as you can see from the linked Strava activity, the course had several (six) turnarounds, which made it very easy to track how close the people behind you were).

After the first mile, I felt that my group was slowing me down, so I made the risky decision to go on my own; at about 2km, the race goes on an highway overpass. As someone that lives and trains on a fairly hilly area of Ireland, I love running both uphill and downhill, and without even noticing, I closed most of the gap from the leader in just that short timeframe. By 3km, we were running together on a long, windy stretch of rolling hills. I pondered for a couple of kms on what to do.. I've never been in that position before and racing strategically has never been something I'm good at. Just past 5km we have the second turnaround, which is conveniently located in the middle of a small climb. I knew I was the better of the two runners on a hill, so I decided to test the water and slightly pick up the pace. The other runner didn't react, and I found myself leading the race, something I could've never even dream of!

The next 15km are almost uneventful... I kept a fairly steady pace, checked my lead on the chasers at every turnaround, and saw that I always had a consistent and fairly safe advantage; however, on the second lap, on the longest stretch of road, another runner decided it was time to catch me, and picked up the pace. At around 16k (10 miles), at the turnaround, I still had a decent margin, but just 1km after that, a passionate steward warned me that the guy was closing the gap. I grinned my teeth and tried to stay strong and attack the rolling hills without slowing down. However, at about 19km, in between all the 10k runners I was overtaking (there was a simultaneous 10k started just 10 mins after us, so the ""faster"" runners of the HM had to deal with a lot of overtaking), I started hearing the unmistakable sound of someone approaching fast from behind.. and right at the 20km marker the guy completed his chase and was right beside me.

This is the moment of the race I am the most proud of.. as I said before, racing strategically is not something I am familiar with, and by that point my brain was telling me ""you never even hoped for a result like this, don't be in pain, second place is good enough"". I somehow managed to fight that thought, and with just 700 meters to go I tested my opponent by slightly speeding up; I knew I would have not been able to keep that pace for long, but his slow and somewhat suffered reaction told me that I had more in the tank than him! I let him catch me again, ran alongside him, and with just 300 meters (\~1000 feet) to go, I started my sprint, zig-zagging through 10k runners (who the hell decided to have such a narrow finish chute with two simultaneous races...) and getting to metaphorically break the tape for the first time in my life!

The final recorded time is 1:18:37 but... most people's GPS recorded a race about 200 meters short! Despite the passive-aggressive replies of the organizers, adamant in saying that the course was accurately measured, the feeling is that I've been robbed of a proper PB, which pisses me off quite a bit!

# Post-race

Right after the race I got to enjoy some well deserved refreshment, an extremely informal prize ceremony (I got approached by a guy handing me an envelope and a pack of energy gels, ""you won, this is yours, bye""), and to cheer other runners as I waited for my friend and my wife to cross the finish line as well.

After that, more food and drinks and a looooong night of sleep. I then booked a recovery session at a local place (compression boots, ice bath, jacuzzi, all the fancy stuff!) and started looking ahead to Dublin.

I'm still not sure how I am going to attack that race: last year I finished in 3:17:12, which clearly needs to go as a PB :) My goal at the beginning of the year was sub 3:10, but now that is outdated as well. Conservatively, I think sub-3 is absolutely doable, but a more aggressive approach could lead me closer to 2:50, which would be just incredible!

You have a dream to be a apart of a large business venture that has an impact on peoples lives...and you are visualizing it, and nothing is happening...(so you think) and you decide to get a job as a house cleaner at a wealthy person’s home, and while you're cleaning their home you overhear them talking about Bitcoin with a friend, and you decide to give them a tip based on something you heard on the news. They decide to follow your advice, make a great trade, and end up thanking you by giving you some of the money...

You then take that money to the store, planning to buy something simple, you end up overhearing a conversation between two people about a startup...you ask one of them for more information about it,  You mention that you just gave a really good tip to someone and they gave you a bunch of money because of it...You hit it off with the founder, and even though you weren’t planning on investing, they offer you a chance to get in early, and since you have this money you just received and figured that it must be serendipitous that you happened to run into them shortly after. You decide to invest, and then the startup takes off and suddenly you’re sitting on a fortune...

With that wealth, you finally travel the world. In Italy, while sipping coffee at a small café, a stranger overhears you telling your story and invites you to a charity gala that evening. You go, and at your table is a famous author looking for their next big book idea. They’re captivated by your story, and before long your journey is published worldwide and turned into a hit movie.

At the movie premiere, you’re seated in the front row when a renowned entrepreneur leans over, introduces themselves, and offers to partner with you on a groundbreaking venture. That venture grows into something massive, transforming industries, creating jobs, and making a real impact on people’s lives.

and **ALL** of this happened simply because you took a job as a house cleaner, heard something on the news, and made the decision to share your tip with them....

1muduib,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1muduib,"Separating VHF and UHF bands becoming a ""lost art"" anymore? (Part 2: my Magnavox MANT100, again)","-Case #1: reception in my bedroom

I still uniquely use the Magnavox MANT-100 SmartWave antenna *(pictured)* for my bedroom TV mainly because I've been too nostalgic about three-hundred-ohm twin-lead connectors that have been no longer manufactured by big brands.

Actually, I bought it just as one of the antennas for my (less tech savvy) parents' late-2010s Sony Bravia smart TV. They, especially my father, have barely used an old 2000s Jensen antenna's tuning dial, which I posted about one or two years ago. [As nearly(?) a completionist, perhaps, I had used the Jensen antenna for a lo-VHF station that was previously not as powerful under a previous ownership as it is now under the newest one.]

Thus, the old Jensen antenna has improved my experience... but not for long. Indeed, when I gave up my 2019 Westinghouse TV/DVD combo (the still working DVD player was somewhat wearing out), Best Buy was able to give me store credit (in form of a gift card) under my previous TV's protection plan. Then I bought a new Westinghouse Roku TV for my bedroom. Consequently, the TV was able to obtain and decode a low-power station using hi-VHF, but the reception wasn't that great or grand or whatever. (I found out recently that the station's been using MPEG-4 codec for its subchannels, which my old Sony dumb/feature widescreen TV has been unable to decode.)

Thus, the Magnavox MANT-100, which has still the separate three-hundred-ohm twin-lead connectors for VHF and UHF. Actually, I bought it just to replace the Philips passive antenna (which I posted about one year ago) for, again, my parents' smart TV.

(Last week, I gave away a Philips antenna to replace one of my (even less tech savvy) uncles' antenna that he bought from Tiktok. It's some knockoff amplified antenna that was unable to obtain a Fox station properly. The NFL season is coming up, and MLB baseball games have been on Fox on Saturdays.)

[Honestly, for the Philips antenna connected to my parents' TV, I didn't think then about using a discarded cardboard box (as a vertical stand for an antenna) and then buying a coax splice adapter and an RG6 coax cable (for cable extension) as I have done this week for a 2000s or 2010s GE antenna, which I'll explain in another paragraph.]

----

Meanwhile, my (less than tech savvy) parents' experience with the Magnavox antenna have worsened. Thus, again, I swapped both the Magnavox and Jensen antennas: Jensen one for, again, my parents' smart TV; Magnavox MANT100 for my Roku TV. [Later then, I swapped a Jensen antenna to an old compact GE antenna (that I bought on eBay last or this year) because my parents have barely, if not never, used the Jensen one's tuning dial to correct/manage the reception well.]

To improve reception of that low-power station using hi-VHF, I discovered that the Magnavox antenna's rabbit ears portion is detachable. Indeed, when I split the portions away from each other, the station's reception improved a lot. Thus, I had to stack some coffee cups in order to help the rabbit ear portion hold upright. Also, I stuffed one of coffee cups with napkins, hopefully, to maintain the stacked coffee cups' balance. (I posted this experience months back.)

To this date, I've not looked back much, so then I've wondered why companies have decided to build VHF/UHF combo antennas instead of ones for only one date

Why u should checkout $JOE on Solana.

$JOE doesn’t promise the moon or Mars, but something even more powerful relatability .

1. $JOE Represents Everyone

We all know a Joe -your neighbor, your coworker, your gym buddy, your uncle at the BBQ. Joe is the guy who works hard, cracks jokes, pays bills, and dreams big. He’s not flashy, but he’s real.

$JOE was made to represent the everyday hero - the 9-to-5 grinder, the coffee addict, the dreamer, the doer, the underdog. By owning $JOE, you’re not betting on a corporation or an elite .you’re investing in the idea that ordinary people matter.

2. It’s More Than a Coin ,It’s a Movement.

Memecoins have rewritten the rules of finance, culture, and community. From Doge to Pepe, the power of memes has shown us that community is above everything.

$JOE is the next evolution. It’s not about worshiping a dog or chasing hype .it’s about celebrating us. The community is made of real people, building something fun, inclusive, and real.

When you buy $JOE, you’re not just holding a coin ,you’re part of a movement where every average Joe has a voice.


3.Simple, Honest, Real

$JOE isn’t trying to be your financial overlord. There’s no overcomplicated whitepaper or false promises. It’s as straightforward as the guy it’s named after: no fluff, no scammy nonsense, just a memecoin that’s fun, honest, and easy to get behind.

And in a space full of rug pulls and vaporware, that kind of honesty is rare.

4.Early Days = Big Potential

We’re still early. $JOE is just getting started. The community is growing, memes are flying, and momentum is building. Remember when everyone laughed at Dogecoin? Or missed the Shiba wave?
Don’t sleep on Joe. 
This might be the most down-to-earth coin on the market, but its potential? Anything but average.


Everyone’s chasing the next big thing. But sometimes the biggest thing is the one right in front of us: the average, hardworking, humble guy who shows up every day.

That’s Joe. That’s $JOE.
And that’s why it just might be the smartest coin you ever bought.

Buy $JOE. Be a part of the everyman revolution.
Because sometimes, the most powerful thing you can be is yourself.

Just an Average Joe is a community-driven Solana meme coin. We have over 1,700 community members on X, including a Chinese community. The CTO team is being led by one of the members who previously led the $Neiro on eth CTO team.

1mudryf,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1mudryf/explore_if_raw_basics_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Explore if RAW BASICS laundry detergent sheets deliver a zero-waste cleaning solution review,"**My Experience with Raw Basics B0BNLVDZ6T Laundry Detergent Sheets**

Laundry has been an unavoidable task in my household, and over the years, I've tried countless detergents—liquid, powder, pods, you name it. Recently, I came across the **Raw Basics B0BNLVDZ6T**, a product touted as zero waste, plastic-free, unscented, and capable of 100 loads in eco-conscious packaging. This caught my attention not just as a laundry solution but as a sustainable lifestyle choice. After using it for a couple of months, I’ve got quite a bit to share.

**Eco-Conscious Design**

These detergent sheets come in compact, unbleached cardboard packaging – a refreshing and guilt-free alternative to bulky plastic containers. The minimalist and eco-friendly design speaks volumes to individuals dedicated to reducing single-use plastics. The sheets are also lightweight and take up much less space in storage compared to traditional detergent bottles.

One thing that I found particularly impressive was just how smartly these sheets are designed for convenience. There’s no mess when handling them—no liquid spills or powdery residue everywhere—and given how much I've previously struggled with liquid detergent caps dripping everywhere, this was a game-changer. 

**[See Raw Basics B0BNLVDZ6T deals on Amazon now.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bnlvdz6t/)**

**Strengths**

- **Zero Waste Mission**: Reducing plastic waste was a big motivator for picking these sheets. The biodegradable cardboard packaging decomposes quickly, aligning with the zero-waste promise.  
- **Space Saving**: Their compact size is ideal for small laundry spaces or for those living in apartments like me. 
- **User-Friendly**: No tearing open liquid packs or cleaning up residue; the sheets are neat and easy to use.  
- **Perfect for Sensitive Skin**: With no scent and harsh chemicals like parabens or sulfates, it’s been gentle on my kid’s skin, which is a huge plus in my book.  

**Deep Cleaning Capabilities**

Despite being an eco-friendly and zero-waste product, these sheets don’t compromise on cleaning performance. I’ve tested them with workout clothes, greasy kitchen towels, and coffee-stained shirts—the enzymatic action in these sheets really worked to lift tough dirt from the fabrics. Whites looked bright, and the colors of my garments held strong after several washes.

One minor drawback here is with particularly stubborn stains. On grimly-soiled items like grass-stained jeans or food-stained napkins, I found myself using an entire sheet rather than half, as advertised for standard loads. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but worth noting if you’ve got kids who treat grass like a playground or a partner clumsy with tomato sauce.

**Convenience for Travelers**

If portability is on your checklist, this product excels. Taking the Raw Basics sheets on my recent camping trip made washing clothes in portable washers a breeze. The compact packaging slipped into my backpack effortlessly, and their lack of liquid means no TSA hassle. A lightweight alternative to lugging around bottles or full packs of powder detergent, these are designed for practical people on the move.

**Key Benefits**

- Completely fragrance-free, which makes it suitable for perfume-sensitive individuals.  
- Lightweight and portable, saving both space and effort while traveling.  
- Vegetarian and cruelty-free formulation.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- For exceptionally heavy stains, these sheets may occasionally fall short unless doubled up.  
- The biodegradability of the material relies on proper disposal methods; tossing it in improper waste streams could defeat the purpose.  
- Compared to some liquid options, it doesn’t dissolve as quickly in colder water.  

**Rival Brands**

In comparing this product to other eco-conscious offerings, such as Tru Earth Laundry Strips and Earth Breeze, Raw Basics holds its own impressively. Tru Earth, for example, comes with slightly higher-performing cleaning power when dissolving in cold water but tends to be pricier in the long run. Earth Breeze, while efficient, adds optional scents which may not appeal to users with sensitivities. Raw Basics’ pure unscented option and biodegradable packaging make it a standout in this regard.

On the flip side, mainstream heavyweights like Tide Pods or Arm & Hammer liquid detergents still deliver unmatched stain removal across all fabric types. That said, they’re far from environmentally friendly and retain artificial fragrance additives that some of us could do without. While Raw Basics isn't displacing Tide for sheer cleaning strength, its edge in sustainability makes it a promising contender for environmentally conscious shoppers.

**Price Performance**

Without delving into exact figures, I’d say this product is aligned with other eco-laundry innovations. While it’s undeniably pricier than conventional detergent jugs per load, the reduced waste and ease of use make the cost worth it for people prioritizing sustainability. Compared to less environmentally ethical products, it’s not just laundry detergent—it’s part of a broader commitment to reducing our carbon footprint.

Sustainability-minded consumers don’t just buy “clean” products but invest in a cleaner future, and Raw Basics reflects that principle beautifully.

Greetings from the darker corners of the digital sphere, where the samovars are leaking and the cyber strategy smells faintly of desperation and boiled cabbage.

Russia just announced Stage Three of its government bug bounty programme. In theory: strengthen critical services like the Unified Biometric System. In reality: it’s giving “please help us plug the holes before NATO notices” energy.

💸 Rewards? Up to 1 million roubles. Translation: a decent lunch in Barcelona.
🖥️ Target? e-Gov and biometric systems — aka reused code + state secrets duct-taped together.
👤 Who can join? White hats, grey hats, or that kid still on house arrest for jailbreaking a traffic light.

What They Say / What They Mean:

“Enhance security of government platforms.” → We’re hemorrhaging tech talent faster than Aeroflot loses luggage.

“Earn up to 1 million roubles.” → Less than a London coffee budget. Also maybe an FSB tail.

“Programme is open until 2026.” → Assuming the economy doesn’t pancake first.

The Bigger Picture:
Russia’s tech sector is collapsing under sanctions + brain drain. Bug bounties aren’t resilience. They’re smoke signals from a burning server room. Digital sovereignty is being held together by freelancers, fear, and fanfare.

Spreadsheets, Samovars, and Surveillance:
I’ve been running Russian digital ministry statements through a quick NLP tracker — you’d be shocked how often “fortification” = “we messed up, blame NATO.”

This is the first in my series: “Between the Cyber Samovar and the State.” Upcoming:

[Boston Globe article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/18/metro/ghost-guns-seized-somerville/), with photo

""A Somerville man is facing charges after police allegedly discovered numerous “ghost guns,” firearm parts, a 3D printer, and a workbench in a raid on his home Friday, federal prosecutors said.

Robert Butland, 38, who was convicted in 2017 of assault and battery on a police officer, among other charges, is charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, according to court documents. He made an initial appearance in federal court in Boston on Friday and was ordered held pending a detention hearing on Wednesday, prosecutors said.

Authorities obtained a search warrant for Butland’s home Thursday after an investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that he had been purchasing gun parts and 3D printers from companies across the country since 2022, court documents show.

In a search of Butland’s Oak Street home on Friday, investigators found ghost guns strewn around his bedroom in nightstands, backpacks, coffee table drawers, and a locked closet, court documents show.

...In another room, police discovered a 3D printer, a work bench, and “tools consistent with tools that would be required for the assembly and manufacture of firearms,” authorities wrote.

Three years without sex shouldn't feel like a death sentence, but staring at these blueprints at 7 AM on a Monday, I'm starting to think my vibrator deserves hazard pay.

I can’t shake the gnawing thought that all my training, all those sleepless nights and perfect grades, somehow haven’t prepared me for this.

""Dakota, they're here.""

My father's voice sliced through my calculations of exactly how fucked we were.

Thirty million in debt, bleeding clients, and now the Sullivan Brothers were here to either save us or pick our bones clean.

I straightened my blazer, the one that screamed 'take me seriously' and tried to look like someone who hadn't just been calculating if we'd last another quarter.

""Remember what this means,"" Dad said, gray eyes holding that familiar weight of disappointment-in-advance. ""This partnership—""

""—сould define Freeman Industries' future. And mine. I know,"" I cut him off.

After years of being his 'assistant' while running half the firm, I'd memorized his greatest hits.

TOP-1 song: Dakota, You're Not The Son I Wanted But You'll Have To Do.

The conference room door opened, and my carefully constructed professional facade shattered like my last relationship—spectacularly and without warning.

Sweet mother of hostile takeovers…

Three men entered, and suddenly I understood why romance novels existed. They moved like apex predators in Armani, all sharp angles and controlled power and I understood why failing companies bent over backwards for Sullivan Stone Company.

Oh, I’d definitely bent over for one of them… or for all of them…

Geez, focus, Dakota! They're here to evaluate the carcass, not save you.

""Bruce."" The tallest one, voice smooth as a leveraged buyout, held out his hand. ""Good to finally meet in person.""

""Good to meet you all, Raphael."" Dad shook hands with drowning-man desperation. ""This is my daughter, Dakota. She'll be your point person on Meridian Tower.""

Raphael Sullivan's gaze swept over me—analytical, dismissive, and somehow still hot enough to make my knees weak.

Late thirties, silver threading through dark hair, radiating never-heard-no energy.

“Ms. Freeman,” he nodded, firmly taking my hand.

""Dakota, please."" I matched his grip because weakness meant game over.

""My brothers. Stephen handles client relations. Titus manages technical operations.""

Stephen Sullivan smiled, and my organs inside started composing poetry. Warm brown eyes, charm that probably got him out of speeding tickets and into pants with equal efficiency.

""Dakota, what a pleasure. Your father told us wonderful things about you.""

""All lies, I assure you.""

*Professional, Dakota. Professional.*

But Stephen laughed, genuine and rich, and suddenly I was calculating if thirty-five was too old or just old enough to know exactly what he was doing.

""I like her already,"" he told his brothers.

Then Titus stepped forward. Where his brothers were obvious, he was a puzzle wrapped in a three-piece suit.

Intense hazel eyes cataloging my every breath, sharp cheekbones that could cut glass.

""Your structural analysis of the Morrison Building was brilliant,"" he said without preamble. ""Though your load calculations on the east wall were off by 0.003%.""

Stomach drop. They'd studied our work. Of course they had.

""They were not—"" I stopped, ran the numbers. Shit. ""Oh, you're right.""

Dad winced. Titus's lips twitched—amusement or blood in the water.

""Shall we discuss the project?"" Raphael's tone suggested the fun part was over.

We settled around the table, and I pulled up my presentation, grateful for something to focus on besides Stephen's forearms.

His rolled sleeves revealed what belonged in my mental museum dedicated to Things That Make Dakota Accidentally Moan.

""Meridian Tower represents a two-billion-dollar investment,"" I began, clicking through slides. ""Forty-seven floors of mixed-use space, sustainable design with luxury amenities. The challenge is balancing structural integrity with aesthetic vision while maintaining cost efficiency.""

""Walk us through your foundation proposals,"" Titus interrupted, leaning forward.

""Given the soil composition and water table depth, I'm recommending a mat foundation with—""

""That's unnecessarily expensive,"" Raphael cut in. ""Pile foundations would be more cost-effective.""

""And also more likely to shift given the clay content below thirty feet,"" I shot back, pulling up geological surveys. ""Unless you'd like to explain to investors why their two-billion-dollar baby is tilting like Pisa in twenty years?""

Stephen made a sound between laugh and cough. Titus's eyes sharpened with interest, but Raphael's jaw tightened.

""Show me the data,"" Raphael demanded.

I did, sliding into a comfortable rhythm of numbers and facts, forgetting momentarily that I was surrounded by men who'd stepped out of my deepest fantasies.

The ones I definitely didn't journal about with hearts and x-rated doodles.

""Impressive,"" Titus murmured when I finished. ""Your father undersold your abilities.""

""Story of my life."" Then louder, ""Thank you. I believe in thorough preparation.""

""As do we,"" Stephen said, smile returning. ""Which is why we're looking forward to working closely with you over the next year.""

Year. Right.

Twelve months of daily interaction with men who made me remember I had needs beyond professional success and daddy's approval.

""Speaking of which,"" Dad interjected, standing. ""I'll leave you to discuss timeline details. Dakota has full authority to make decisions on Freeman Industries' behalf.""

Translation: *Don't fuck this up or I'll never let you forget it.*

After he left, the atmosphere shifted.

Without my father as buffer, I was acutely aware of being alone with three men radiating enough masculine energy to power Manhattan.

""So,"" Stephen settled back like he owned the place—which, given their net worth, he probably could. ""Tell us about yourself, Dakota. What drives someone so young to take on this magnitude of project?""

""Masochism, mostly,"" I said before my brain-to-mouth filter engaged. ""And desperate need for paternal approval that therapy hasn't fixed.""

*Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.*

But Stephen laughed, even Raphael's expression cracked slightly.

""Honest,"" Titus observed. ""That's refreshing.""

""Sorry, character flaw I'm working on,"" I said, gathering papers. ""Now, about those timelines—""

""Have dinner with us,"" Stephen interrupted. ""Tonight. We can discuss timelines and get to know our new partner better.""

Professional boundaries existed for a reason.

Mine were currently dissolving faster than my last relationship—which, fun fact, had also involved inappropriate attraction to a coworker. You'd think I'd learn.

""That's not—""

""Tomorrow. Nine AM. Our office."" Raphael guillotined Stephen's invitation. ""We'll finalize the timeline and deliverables then. Prepare for due diligence that'll make today look like casual conversation.""

Stephen shot his brother with a multilingual look, but Raphael was already moving. Gravity, non-negotiable.

They filed out, leaving me alone with my laptop and a libido staging full revolt against better judgment.

I started packing, telling myself this was just business.

Just a year-long project with three incredibly attractive older men who made me want things that would revoke my Good Girl Club membership immediately.

As I reached for the door, my father's voice drifted from his office.

""I always hoped for a son to carry on the legacy. Dakota's capable, but she needs to prove she can handle the pressure. If she can't... at least the Sullivan boys will keep the firm alive.""

The words hit like ice water, dousing my heated brain with familiar cold reality.

From now on, this wasn’t just about proving I deserved my birthright or validating years of hard work.

It was also about showing those three men that I was professional enough to lead my father’s business and honor its legacy.

If they didn’t see me as equal, I’d lose not only the position but the firm itself, slipping into their control instead.

Nine AM at Sullivan Stone Company's forty-floor monument to capitalism made my best blazer look like I'd stolen it from a mall mannequin.

""Dakota!"" Stephen appeared in the lobby like corporate America's answer to a greeting card, holding two coffees. ""Perfect timing. Thought you might need caffeine for the morning briefing.""

Oat milk latte, extra shot, half pump vanilla.

My exact order for the past three years. ""How did you—""

""Lucky guess,"" he said with the biggest smile. ""Come on, I'll give you the tour before Titus starts his structural inquisition.""

""Structural inquisition sounds ominous,"" I said, following him to the elevator. ""Should I have brought a lawyer? Or a priest?""

Stephen laughed, pressing the button for the twentieth floor.

""Just your brain and maybe some patience. Titus can be... intense about specifications.""

""Intense. Right…""

The twentieth floor hallway cost more than my education. Stephen played tour guide past abstract art that looked like money having an identity crisis.

""Fair warning—when Titus gets that look, like he's mentally recalculating the universe's mathematical constants, just let him work through it. Fighting makes it worse.""

""What look?""

""You'll know it when you see it.""

The conference room was glass and ergonomic intimidation. Titus was already there, surrounded by enough spreadsheets to wallpaper Manhattan.

""Dakota."" No hello, just acknowledgement. ""I've been reviewing your foundation proposals.""

""Good morning to you too,"" I muttered, setting down my coffee.

Stephen's hand brushed my shoulder as he moved past. Casual and brief, but somehow my skin burned through two layers of fabric.

""I've identified several areas where your calculations could be optimized,"" Titus continued, finally raising those intense hazel eyes. ""Your safety margins are excessive.""

""Excessive?"" I leaned over the papers, trying to ignore Stephen.

He positioned himself close enough that I could smell his cologne, something that probably had a pretentious name like 'Boardroom Seduction.'

""Those margins account for potential soil shift over the building's lifetime.""

""The probability of that level of shift is 0.0003%,"" Titus said, pulling up his laptop. ""You're overengineering.""

""And you're underestimating Manhattan's tendency to surprise us,"" I shot back, grabbing his laptop to pull up my geological data. ""See this? That's a fault line that wasn't on surveys from ten years ago. Small, yes, but… wait. This calculation is wrong.""

I pointed to his load-bearing specifications for the northeast corner.

""You forgot to account for wind shear at that height. Your numbers are off by—""

""They're not off."" His voice went arctic, the temperature in the room plummeting faster than my dating prospects. ""I don't make mistakes like that.""

""Everyone makes mistakes,"" I said, pulling up the correct formula. ""Look, you just need to adjust for—""

""Hey,"" Stephen interjected, his laugh sounding like someone had strangled a golden retriever. ""No harm done, Titus. Easy fix.""

But Titus's stare could've frozen hell.

His jaw worked like he was chewing glass, and I realized I'd just committed the cardinal sin of proving a Sullivan brother wrong.

The silence that followed was so thick you could've built another skyscraper with it.

""Well,"" Stephen said, clearly trying to resurrect the mood from whatever grave I'd just dug, ""how about we move on to timeline discussions? Raphael should be here—""

The door opened like it had been choreographed, and Raphael entered with the kind of presence that made everyone else feel like extras in his movie.

""Are we ready to begin?""

He didn't ask so much as decree, settling at the head of the table like a king taking his throne.

""Dakota found an error in Titus's calculations,"" Stephen offered, apparently deciding to throw me under whatever bus was convenient.

Thanks for the assist, sunshine. Really needed that target painted on me.

Raphael's dark gaze swung to me. ""Did she?""

""Minor wind shear oversight,"" I said, trying to sound casual while Titus looked like he wanted to calculate the exact force needed to throw me out the window. ""Easy fix.""

Titus looked ready to calculate the trajectory needed to launch me through the window.

""I see."" Raphael opened his tablet. ""Let's discuss your proposed modifications to the upper floor layouts. I have concerns.""

Of course he did.

For the next hour, he dissected my designs with surgical precision, questioning every choice, every angle, every fucking doorway placement.

He zoomed into one of the renderings and looked up with a raised brow.

""Executive floors need natural light,"" he declared, swiping through my designs like they’d personally offended him. ""This is a bunker.""

I didn’t flinch. “It’s called executive privacy. Your millionaires aren’t paying for reality TV exposure.”

“They’re paying for spaces that project success.”

I stepped closer, tapped the screen over two walls. “Fine. Floor-to-ceiling here and here. Privacy maintained, ego stroked.”

He paused, not because he was defeated, but because he was recalibrating. Something shifted behind his usually impassive expression. Not approval—but recognition. Respect, maybe.

""Acceptable.""

From Raphael Sullivan, that was practically a Nobel Prize.

The morning blurred into technical warfare disguised as collaboration. I dove deep into blueprints and load calculations, using them as shields against the constant awareness.

Stephen kept finding reasons to lean close—checking figures, reviewing details—each proximity another test of my focus.

Titus hadn't looked at me since the calculation incident, but I caught him drumming his fingers—tap tap tap pause, tap tap tap pause, tap tap pause tap tap.

Like morse code for 'I'm plotting your demise.'

And Raphael... fuck, Raphael commanded the room without trying. His every movement was controlled and purposeful.

Except once, when his assistant knocked to remind him about something, and he said, ""Tell Lily I'll try to make the play.""

The softness in his voice lasted maybe two seconds, but it was like seeing Superman bleed—proof he was human after all.

God, remember why you're here. Freeman Industries. Not to decode emotionally constipated billionaires.

""I think we've covered enough for today,"" Raphael announced as the clock hit four. ""Dakota, we'll need your revised proposals by Friday.""

""You'll have them by Thursday,"" I said, because apparently I was a masochist who liked impossible deadlines.

The room went quiet for a beat, and I could feel three pairs of eyes land on me.

It wasn't defiance, not really. More like desperation wrapped in determination. But if I didn’t push myself, who else would take me seriously?

Stephen fell into step beside me as I headed for the elevator.

""Ambitious,"" he said, almost like it was a compliment. ""I appreciate that quality.""

""What other qualities do you appreciate?"" The question escaped before my professional filter engaged.

Shit. That sounded like flirting. Flirting with your dad’s extremely hot and way older than me business partners.

Cancel. CANCEL.

He grinned.""Your thorough preparation. Your attention to detail. Your complete inability to hide what you're thinking.""

""I hide plenty,"" I protested.

""Sure you do."" The elevator opened, and he stepped back. ""See you tomorrow, Dakota. Wear something comfortable, we'll be doing site visits.""

But I was halfway through the lobby when I realized I'd left my phone in the conference room.

The elevator ride back up felt longer, probably because I was mentally kicking myself for flirting with Stephen fucking Sullivan.

Twentieth floor, deserted. Almost at the conference room when Stephen's voice filtered through the door.

""Yes, Bruce, she's a good assistant. Very thorough, very dedicated."" A pause. ""She'll be easy to handle.""

The words hit like a physical blow.

Assistant. Manageable. *Easy to handle*.

Not an architect. Not a partner. *Not an equal.*

Just *an assistant to be managed*.

The coffee turned bitter in my stomach as clarity struck. The perfect order, the warm smiles—it wasn’t an interest.

It was Stephen Sullivan doing what he did best: managing people.

And I was just another one to handle. If they didn’t see me as their equal, I’d lose more than pride—I’d lose my shot at leading.

The firm would be theirs. Freeman Industries would become another Sullivan acquisition, and I'd become another footnote in someone else's success story.

I backed away from the door, phone forgotten, fury building.

Well then, from tomorrow these privileged assholes would learn exactly what kind of ""assistant"" they were dealing with.

A month of Sullivan-watching had turned me into Sherlock Holmes with a spreadsheet addiction, zero chill and fraying boundaries. Because apparently, memorizing my rivals’ coffee orders now passed for strategic intel.

The data I'd accumulated read like a stalker's manifesto disguised as corporate research.

Stephen Sullivan drank his coffee black with two sugars, stirred exactly three times counterclockwise, and loosened his tie at 2:47 PM with the precision of a Swiss watch.

He laughed at his own jokes with the confidence of someone who'd never experienced secondhand embarrassment. Smiled like America's golden retriever, but occasionally flashed teeth that reminded you that dogs descended from wolves.

Titus Sullivan required Earl Grey at precisely 175 degrees, no additives, like some kind of mathematical equation in human form.

He tapped his pen in groups of four when calculating, never smiled before noon, and stared at people like he was solving complex algorithms where X equaled your deepest insecurities and Y equaled your inevitable failure.

Raphael Sullivan consumed double espressos like penance for unspoken sins, checked his phone at exactly :15 and :45 past every hour, and commanded rooms through sheer gravitational pull.

The man had turned authority into an art form, making everyone else look like amateur finger painters at the Louvre.

Instead, I'd played myself.

Every observation became fuel for late-night fantasies that left me frustrated and exhausted. Professional distance had become a joke I told myself while mentally undressing them during PowerPoint presentations.

Which is how I fucked up spectacularly.

""As you can see on floor twelve,"" I said, clicking through the Meridian Tower presentation, ""the executive suites will feature—""

""Wait,"" Mr. Nakamura from Nakamura Group interrupted, frowning at his copy. ""This says floor twenty-two has the executive suites. Floor twelve is marked for general office space.""

My blood turned to ice water. I flipped to my notes.

*Fuck. Fuck. FUCK.*

""I… That's… Let me just—"" I scrambled through papers while five sets of eyes watched me drown in my own incompetence. ""There seems to be a discrepancy—""

""A discrepancy?"" Raphael's voice could've frozen hell. ""Ms. Freeman, are you telling us you've presented incorrect specifications for a two-billion-dollar project?""

The conference room felt like a funeral home. Mine, specifically.

""I can explain—""

""No need,"" Mr. Nakamura said, standing. ""Perhaps when Sullivan Stone has sorted out its internal communications, we can revisit this discussion.""

The next ten minutes blurred into handshakes and apologies while I stood there like a statue made of shame and professional suicide.

When the door finally closed behind Nakamura Group, the silence that followed felt louder than any scream.

""My office,"" Raphael said. ""All of you. Now.""

The death march to his corner office felt endless.

Titus remained silent, shooting me glances I couldn't decode. Probably calculating the statistical probability of my spontaneous combustion.

Raphael didn't sit. He stood behind his desk like a judge about to pass a sentence, and I wondered if professional death came with last words.

""This is exactly what I was afraid of when we agreed to this partnership. If you can't handle basic floor numbers—floor numbers, Dakota—how can we trust you with actual complexity?""

""It was just one mistake—""

""One mistake that almost cost us Nakamura Group. Fix this by Friday or we reconsider your involvement entirely.""

The words hit like a professional death sentence.

My stomach dropped somewhere around my heels. Reconsider my involvement meant failing. Meant proving my father right.

Meant everything I'd worked for crumbling because I'd been too busy fantasizing about my business partners to do my actual job.

""She gets it, Raph,"" Stephen sprawled in his chair with that dangerous ease that made my skin prickle. ""Though maybe she needs proper motivation. Weekend work without pay? Or better yet, she could apologize to every team member individually. Really grovel, make sure she understands her place in the hierarchy.""

The room went arctic. Even Raphael looked like someone had slapped him.

His laugh sparkled with broken glass. ""Kidding! Jesus, everyone's so serious. Can't anyone take a joke anymore?""

But I'd glimpsed something beneath that sunshine exterior, a flash of enjoyment at the idea of watching me squirm.

The golden retriever mask had slipped, revealing something with sharper teeth and less wholesome intentions.

""Enough of that."" Titus's quiet intervention cut through the tension like a scalpel through bullshit.

Everyone turned because Titus Sullivan defending anyone was like discovering your calculator had developed empathy.

""She made a mistake. We all make them. Remember the Henderson account, Stephen?""

Stephen's smile tightened into something less friendly. ""That was different—""

""Was it?"" Titus turned those analytical eyes on his brother with the precision of someone who kept receipts. ""Dakota, I'll review the specifications with you. Come find me when you're ready.""

\* \* \*

The next day arrived with me attacking those specifications like they contained the cure for professional humiliation.

Every number triple-checked, every floor plan verified until my eyes burned and my spine curved into a question mark.

When Titus materialized at 7 PM with Thai food and fresh perspective, I nearly cried from exhaustion masquerading as gratitude.

""You switched them during the third revision,"" he pulled up the file history with surgical precision. ""Here, when you were probably running on coffee and determination instead of sleep.""

""Tired isn't an excuse,"" I stabbed at a pad thai with unnecessary violence.

""No, but it's the reason. There's a significant difference between incompetence and human error."" He caught another mistake I'd missed, fixing it without the judgment I'd been drowning in. ""You're not incompetent, Dakota. Just distracted by things you're pretending not to notice.""

Heat flooded my face with the subtlety of a California wildfire. ""I'm completely focused on this project and nothing else.""

""Of course. That's why you've memorized our coffee orders and noticed when Stephen adjusts his tie."" His tone suggested he found my denial more amusing than convincing.

We worked in silence that felt different from his usual arctic efficiency, something almost like understanding passing between us.

Like maybe behind all that computational coldness, Titus Sullivan actually understood what it felt like to constantly calculate every move in this corporate chess game where the pieces kept changing rules.

Day three brought another morning of avoiding eye contact with anyone named Sullivan.

I’d perfected the art of pretending spreadsheets held ancient wisdom as Stephen approached, radiating his usual sunshine optimism that made everything feel worse.

“Hey, Dakota,” he said gently. “Look, I know you’re spiraling over the Nakamura thing, but we’ve all been there. I once sent the Castro proposal to Castillo. Raphael covered for me.”

I stared harder at my screen. “That’s different. You didn’t almost lose us a major client.”

“Actually, I did. But you? You caught one of Titus’s errors—basically a unicorn event.”

From across the room, Titus chimed in, voice like ice.

“If we’re done cheerleading, some of us have real work to do.”

I shrank further into my blazer. Three days of Stephen’s relentless warmth and Titus’s arctic disapproval had me second-guessing everything.

“Ignore him,” Stephen murmured, leaning closer. “He’s just salty that you proved he’s human.”

“I’m right here,” Titus said flatly.

“I know, buddy. That’s why it’s funnier.”

I still couldn’t smile. “I’m working from Freeman Industries for a while,” I muttered, already packing.

“Dakota—”

“I need space. To recalibrate.”

The elevator doors closed on Stephen’s worried face.

But sitting in my father's office now, surrounded by his achievements and the ghost of the son he'd never had, I realized I'd simply traded three flavors of fresh hell for the familiar burn of paternal disappointment.

At least here, the judgment came from someone who'd been let down by my existence since birth.

At least here, I wasn’t losing my mind over three older, devastatingly gorgeous and complicated men… And I still couldn’t tell whether I wanted to hate them or ride each of them.",1,1755595924.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Alarm does not go off, she is sleeping, thank whatever you believe.

Oh, kitchen. The coffee machine is working, unlike her being late. It is dripping drop by drop to the boring mug on a mundane counter.

The smell is waking her up one hour earlier than the usual hour. She is stalling in the bathroom trying to come around. Toothbrush on the left, moisturizer on the right, everything is the same. It is like every object in the house is a prisoner guardian forcing her to carry out the routine. The same vicious cycle.

In front of the mirror, she stands. Stops for a moment, looking at herself thoroughly, as if this was the first time. She raises her left arm up. Her reflection, though, raises right. She laughs. “Don’t be ridiculous.” talking to herself. She swings her left arm this time. Meanwhile, the reflection does so, but ten seconds late.

Her laugh freezes. She moves her head closer to the mirror really slowly and carefully, putting her finger on the mirror next. Cold. The reflection, it is tilting her head but she does not. This time it is for sure, she is not the one seen there. A familiar pair of eyes but dull, the same skin colour but paler.

Deep breath as she takes and writes on the steam with her finger, “Who are you?” The reflection smiles and starts writing something on the same point, but inside. Inside the mirror.

“You.”

Jenny quickly rubbed her face with a washcloth, took a step back. However, the writings did not go away and there was no steam. In the universe behind the mirror, someone else is watching her.

\-

Jenny did not go to work that day. She closed every window, put sheets onto every mirror, except the one in the bathroom. Somebody is waiting for her, or something…

She stands in the front again holding a blanket on herself like doing a ritual. The thing that looks like her is still in the same place, never blinking.

This time Jenny did not write, waited patiently. The reflection, however, touched the glass and started writing on the steamy side.

“It is not just me.” and then suddenly the mirror trembles. The face is gone without any glass pieces but the image is flowing. This time there is a cheerful woman wearing make-up and pearl necklace in a room looking so classic.

“My rich version..” whispered Jenny.

It is changing again, but this time a woman with dark circles under eyes, messy hair in a kitchen full of dirty dishes waiting to be washed, or worse: thrown out.

“My exhausted version.”

This time another image. A kid. 10 year-old or so. Same eyes but smaller face.

“This can’t be me, it should be another life” thought Jenny.

Images are increasing, one time it is a soldier, another is a good-looking man, the last one is looking straight with fury in her eyes with a big scar on her face.

Jenny backs with fear as she sees the writing there “Which one is you?”. She thinks “What if all of them, or none of them?” and at that moment she knew mirrors do not only reflect,

some show  
and  
some summon.

That very night, she is sleeping on the bathroom floor. She has not eaten anything, answered her colleagues’ phones, and left the home. Her eyes are bloodshot. Those “other selves” sometimes vanished for hours, sometimes appearing one after another.

And next morning, one of them, the first one she ever saw, returned with that disturbing smile and focused expression.

“I want to be in your world.”

Jenny freezes while an instinctive big fear is crawling upon her every atom of the spine.

“If I become you, you become me. Fair trade.” an offer that made no sense for Jenny. And yet, the words fair trade echoed in her mind. Thinking about it, Jenny is not satisfied with her dull life. Lonely, repetitive. And now, someone else — someone real- wants her shoes.

Throughout the day, the reflection did not show up. Nor the next day, causing Jenny to grow anxiety. “What if you left?” she asked directly in the mirror. “What if you switched already?” with attachment problems.

Then, the mirror cracks. No impact, no object thrown. Just spreading spiderweb-like fractures appearing on its own. To her luck, the reflection returns. But this time… her face looks broken, one eye is bleeding and lips looking purple.

“If you will not choose, I will.”

“Soon.”

Jenny stumbles back, again, trying to cover the mirror with shaking hands first, then covering her own eyes. Behind the glass, there is a deep and loud sound like nails on a chalkboard.

“Be ready.”

The next night looks darker and colder than usual. The power is gone out across the city. She is sitting in front of the mirror which is wrapped in blankets, not just one. She knows that the reflection is still there as she is removing them. The other self looks calmer now as if she was waiting for this for days.

The glass shimmered and Jenny felt dizzy for a split second. She blinked. At that very moment, reflection moved independently. It felt like racing out- through the glass. No sound. No shattering. Just an invisible hand sliding out from what should have been solid.

Jenny is screaming, trying to hit the sink and gasp for breath, feeling heavy. Wrong. Like her limbs do not belong to her. She turns to the mirror.

What she saw made her drop to her knees. The woman on the other side of the glass- was her. But, you know, not her any more.

Her own reflection looked stunned at first before giving a victorious smile.

Jenny is standing up- no, the other Jenny is standing up. She is on the wrong side of the mirror.

She tries to break the glass, it does not even budge. The woman on the outside, where she was standing one minute ago, waves gently and turns away… and walks out of the bathroom.

“No,” Jenny screams. “Wait.” but this time the mirror does not echo back.

There is no sound.  
No heat.  
No cracks, really, where are the fractures?  
Just, silence…

And then- her own face begins to fade, not vanish no, not disappearing either. Just becoming blurry. As if she was not defined enough to stay or say anything.

She feels breathless and mind spiraling for she has realised this was not a switch, it was a takeover.

Days passed. Or weeks. Maybe months. Does the time move normally inside the mirror? Is there a way to test this?

There was no sunshine, no clocks, not a single sound.  
Only Jenny or what is left of her.

She has tried everything, screaming, pounding, scraping the glass until bleeding.

No one and nothing was heard.

On the other side, the other Jenny- the one wearing her skin and living her life- is living effortlessly. Sometimes she is returning to the mirror just to wave. Sometimes she leaves lipstick marks on the glass. Sometimes she is smiling. Sadly, sometimes she brings others.

Friends that Jenny has never had. Family that she has never been able to bond a strong relationship with. A life that she has never got to live.

Jenny watched it all like a ghost with a body. Definitely present but erased, or mostly ignored.

Then one day, the mirror went black like it stopped broadcasting.  
Just black. No glass, no light. No more outside world. No more her own life.

She was nowhere and no one.

\-

In a different place.  
In a different home.

A man stands in front of his bathroom mirror.

He yawns, brushes his teeth.  
As he turns away, something catches his eye.

His reflection smiles a second too late.

He stares. Blinks. Rubs his eyes.

But the mirror just smiles.

And writes —

I came to Australia in 2020 International Student driving of a fresh start in here and I thought I’d make something out of my life here but it’s five years and I feel like I have destroyed everything instead.

I started a science degree but couldn’t keep up with the unifees, that collapsed and I feel like the complete failure. I switched to a business course and I’m struggling to finish it. I tell myself at least I’m still going but deep down I feel like I just wrecking myself through mud. I m in second last final semester. .

From 2022 to the end of 2023 I lived in depression. I barely recognise who I was in those years. It feels like my soul had left my body and I was just surviving even now. I still don’t feel whole.

I tried different parts to get out of it. I works in Retail shop and I got an internship in consulting group in Melbourne. I always tried my best but I still feel like A kid in that world insecure like I don’t belong.

Financially, I’m drowning. Paycheck to paycheck sometimes I can’t even buy myself a simple coffee without a guilt. Rent stresses me out every single week. My family back home can’t help me so it’s it is just me .no support system .no one to fall back on around .other international students and at least they have partners boyfriends or families who can hold them when they fall. I have no one. I have met guys along the way but it never worked out. I used to cling to love as it would save me but all it gave me was more disappointment.

Now I’m 28 and what do I have? No degree yet no savings ,no stable job, no relationship ,nothing. I feel like a prisoner in my own life sometimes the darkest thoughts creep in ,that maybe I was not meant to make it. maybe I am a mistake. Maybe the universe is punishing me. I call myself unlucky loser a fake person. I even look back at some choices I made during my hardest and feel ashamed. Like I lost control of who I was. I keep wondering if all of this is just karma chasing me, but I never done anything bad for anyone.

every day feels like a fight between wanting to keep going and wanting to give up. I don’t see achievements only failures. I keep asking myself if I should have to differently. Maybe I ruined my whole time.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. Has anyone else feel Like this? Like you have wasted life abd made bad choices. Lived with depression ,lost money and lost yourself and ended up with nothing.??

The idea behind it means a great deal to me, and I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’m looking for honest feedback — whether good or bad — so I can learn and improve.","The Tragic Ship

As I woke up one day, I got a call. I answered it.
“Hello,” I said.
No response.
“Hello? Anyone there?” I said again.
“It’s me,” someone whispered across the line. And as soon as I heard the voice, I knew who it was, but I couldn’t believe it.
“Jocelyn?” I asked.
The answer came: “Hmm.” Her voice was weak, dragging slowly out of her throat.
“I need you here,” Jocelyn said. She sounded hesitant, like she was forcing herself to speak those words.
“Okay… Is everything alright, Jocelyn?” I asked, trying to sound calm even though the call had caught me off guard. She never called me.
“Just come over,” Jocelyn said.
“Alright,” I replied, my voice full of confusion.
Then, as suddenly as the call began, she ended it.
Why did she call me? Better yet—why now, all of a sudden? Her voice sounded sick. Has something happened to her? And why did she need me there? Did I do something to anger her? No, that didn’t sound like anger. Her voice was ill, hesitant… forced. But it didn’t feel like someone was putting words in her mouth either. She’s not the type who’d say something she doesn’t mean. I’m just overcomplicating it. I just hope she’s alright. But then again, hope doesn’t make things easier for her. So why do people hope for the best? Isn’t it selfish—to hope for something that isn’t real but that you want to be real? If I hope for her to be healthy, am I distracting myself from reality? What if she really is sick? I should go see her instead of just hoping.
I left for her place. After three or four hours of travel, my mind was full of her. The why’s, the how’s, the endless what ifs.
Finally, I reached my destination. We were supposed to meet at a coffee shop. As I walked up to the place, I saw her. Yes—it was Jocelyn. But something was wrong. I could tell.
She wasn’t alone. Two girls stood beside her, both about our age.
The girl on her right was the same height as us. Blonde hair, a little longer than shoulder length. Brown skin, round face, black eyes. She was staring at her phone and hadn’t noticed me approach.
The other girl, on her left, was already looking at me. Her hair was jet black, almost unnaturally so. But her eyebrows were lighter, so she must have dyed it. Her skin was pale, almost pinkish. She was slightly taller than us.
Then my eyes fell on Jocelyn. She stood there, staring at the ground, wrapped in a turban-style headscarf. Her eyes looked sleepless, her lips cracked and faded pink. Her skin was pale, almost sickly. Her nose was red around the nostrils, like after you’ve rubbed it raw from fever.
As I reached the group, both girls looked at me, realizing I was the one they’d been waiting for. Slowly, Jocelyn lifted her gaze. Our eyes met.
“Jocelyn…” I said, like it was a question.
“Hey,” she replied, her tone low.
“So, he’s the guy, huh?” the blonde girl asked, glancing at Jocelyn as she slid her phone into her pocket.
“Yeah,” Jocelyn muttered under her breath.
“Okay. Let’s sit in the café. Then we can talk about this,” the black-haired girl said calmly.
“Sounds right,” I replied, glancing at Jocelyn again.
We took our seats inside. The café smelled of fresh coffee. I noticed a odd thing there. There were no people besides us in the café. The coffee machine was on and too loud. And the clock was not working, the numbers weren’t there. But my mind was elsewhere. What’s happening? Who are these two girls? Obviously her friends… but why am I here?
Jocelyn sat with the black-haired girl opposite me. The blonde girl sat beside me.
“Now, tell me what’s happening, Jocelyn. Who are these two girls?” I asked, my tone hurried.
Jocelyn kept her eyes down, silent, as if her lips were sealed—or as if speaking was something she couldn’t bear.
“Allow me,” the black-haired girl said in that same calm tone.
I leaned in, listening carefully.
“We told Jocelyn to call you. She’s stubborn and wouldn’t listen to us, but as her friends, we’re concerned about her condition. She had cancer. Don’t worry—she’s out of immediate danger. But her condition is still critical. No stress, no pressure—that’s what the doctors said. Still, she wasn’t happy. We asked what we could do for her, but she wouldn’t open up to us. Finally, after a lot of pushing, she told us about you. About the breakup with her boyfriend, how she never really talked to many boys… how she struggled. Then she met you. That’s how we know about you. We suggested she call you.”
I’d already suspected something terrible. Now I knew. And I was right. But still, I was glad—more glad than I’d ever been—that she was out of danger.
“It’s good that you’re safe. But… how much do you two know about me?” I asked, relieved but cautious.
“Enough to draw conclusions,” the black-haired girl answered. “The tragic ship—that’s what we call it. Whatever bond you two share, it’s not ordinary. We thought it would help her to see you again. You’re the only boy she ever opened up to. We believe it will help her recover.”
“I see,” I said quietly.
I looked at Jocelyn, wondering why she hadn’t called me herself. I’d told her countless times: If you need me, just text. Did my words mean nothing to her? Still, as a friend, wasn’t it my place to help? But friendship didn’t define what we had. To call it that would be a lie. Tragic, maybe. Complicated, definitely.
But this wasn’t about me. This was about Jocelyn’s health. And despite my promises to leave the past behind, the past doesn’t leave us. It stays, in the form of memories—good and bad. Some wounds teach, some only scar.
But it’s Jocelyn. I could never hurt her. That’s why I was here.
“Okay… I’ll stay. Jocelyn,” I said, looking at her.
She looked back. She didn’t speak, but she didn’t need to. She understood.
We left the café and went to a theatre. Then a museum. Then an amusement park.
At the amusement park, I noticed beneath her head wrap—she had shaved her head. A normal part of treatment. I remembered her as she was: black shoulder-length hair, calm eyes, bright skin that seemed to glow. Now she smiled at me. That smile—it was worth millions. The kind of smile that feels like the first ray of light in a dark room. The first sun after months of rain.
Some people get to see that smile every day. Others live with only its memory. Life isn’t fair. Some puzzles are best left incomplete. Maybe I was one of them.
But when I looked at her, it was as if nothing had changed.
Evening came. It was time to leave. She looked at me, I looked at her. No words, but complete understanding. She stepped forward and hugged me.
Isn’t it strange—how some people make you feel good about yourself just by being near?
The moment she hugged me, I forgot all my problems. It was just us, two souls. People say when you’re in love, time stops. That’s not true. But I wanted it to. Right then.
How selfish of me. But isn’t selfishness just part of being human?
Her heartbeat was steady. Mine raced. They say you see butterflies when you’re in love—but I saw nothing. Everything else faded away. Just us.
It felt like a dream.
…Wait. It was a dream.
I woke up, sweating. My room was old—too old. Dark, walls peeling, furniture broken. The dream clung to me like it had really happened. Then my phone rang.
Then… my phone rang.",0,1755595313.0,shortstories,1,0.5,False

[The Genius Wave Review](https://preview.redd.it/ld32qnqo1yjf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c9d6edac63307e3ef14869e6282fb9e507408c7)

I remember sitting at my desk late one night, frustrated. My side hustle felt like it was spinning its wheels—no traction, no momentum, just endless noise and wasted energy. I had the drive, I had the ambition, but focus was slipping through my fingers. It wasn’t a matter of working harder; I was already grinding myself to the bone. What I needed was leverage.

That’s when I stumbled across a tool that promised something unusual: a **7-minute audio track designed to unlock peak brain performance and trigger deep creative thinking**. Honestly, I rolled my eyes at first. But something about it stuck in the back of my mind. I figured, what’s seven minutes of my life worth compared to staying stuck?

The first time I listened, I noticed something subtle but undeniable. My head felt lighter, the noise in my brain cleared, and ideas I’d been wrestling with for weeks suddenly clicked into place. It wasn’t about hype—it was about clarity. That clarity was priceless.

I started making it a ritual. Every morning, before opening my laptop, I’d put on the track. Within minutes I was hitting a **state of flow**, the kind athletes and entrepreneurs talk about like it’s some secret code. My focus sharpened. My productivity doubled. I wasn’t just working harder—I was working smarter.

The ripple effect was wild. Campaigns that once felt like guesswork became structured and strategic. My copywriting started converting better. My marketing efforts finally had teeth. And the best part? I stopped second-guessing myself. Instead of chasing every shiny tactic, I zeroed in on what mattered: **consistent results, stronger focus, and mental clarity that translated into real income.**

Here’s the thing most people don’t realize: success in business isn’t just about the right strategy. It’s about getting your mind aligned so you can actually execute the strategy with precision. This audio didn’t magically build my side hustle—it gave me the mental edge to do it myself. And that’s why it worked.

If you’ve ever felt like your brain is sabotaging your own progress, this is the tool I’d point you toward. For me, it wasn’t optional—it became the hidden advantage that separated me from the constant grind and pushed me into real momentum.

Because when your mind works like a laser, success stops being a struggle. It becomes inevitable.

The deeper I went with it, the more I realized this wasn’t some placebo. The Genius Wave worked because it tapped into something I hadn’t experienced before: **theta brainwave activation**. That’s the state where your subconscious and conscious mind start syncing. Most people only touch it in those fleeting moments before sleep or right after waking up. But when you can access it intentionally? That’s where things change.

Here’s how it played out in my daily grind. I’d start my mornings like always, coffee in hand, brain fog still clinging. But once I put on the track, within minutes my focus snapped into place. Distractions faded into the background. Instead of drowning in to-do lists, I suddenly knew which task was the needle mover. That shift alone was worth everything.

**Key point:** It wasn’t about getting hyped up. It was about calm clarity. My brain stopped bouncing from idea to idea and started locking onto solutions. Problems that felt impossible suddenly had clear paths forward.

Within weeks, I noticed real numbers changing. My side hustle income started climbing. Emails I wrote after listening to the track pulled double the response rate. Marketing campaigns that had been limping along suddenly caught traction. Even outside of business, I found myself more patient, more present, more in control.

I can’t overstate this: the biggest win wasn’t just financial. It was freedom from the constant mental static. That internal tug-of-war that used to drain me? Gone. And that space gave me the energy to finally build momentum without burning out.

If you’re the type who’s been chasing success strategies, grinding late nights, wondering why it still feels like you’re running in circles, here’s the truth: **it’s not your work ethic—it’s your mental state.** And that’s exactly what The Genius Wave recalibrates.

For me, that 7-minute track became the switch that turned my hustle from a struggle into a system. And once I saw what it could do, I knew I was never going back.

**What is The Genius Wave?**  
The Genius Wave is a short, 7-minute audio track designed to stimulate theta brainwaves. This state is often linked to creativity, focus, and clarity. By listening daily, many people report increased productivity, sharper thinking, and faster problem-solving.

**How does The Genius Wave work?**  
It works by using sound frequencies to guide your brain into the theta state—the same state your mind enters during deep relaxation or meditation. This is where your subconscious becomes more active, allowing new ideas and solutions to surface more easily.

**Is The Genius Wave safe to use?**  
Yes, it’s non-invasive and doesn’t involve anything other than listening with a pair of headphones. It’s a natural way to train your brain for better focus and mental clarity without relying on stimulants or supplements.

**When should I listen to The Genius Wave?**  
Most users listen in the morning before starting their workday, but it can also be effective before creative sessions, brainstorming, or even winding down in the evening. The key is consistency—7 minutes a day is enough to see results.

**How soon can I expect results?**  
For me, I noticed subtle improvements right away—like increased focus and reduced brain fog. Within a few weeks, the changes were undeniable: clearer thinking, higher productivity, and measurable progress in my side hustle business.

**Does The Genius Wave really improve success in business?**  
While results vary, many people find that it gives them the mental edge needed to execute strategies with more precision and focus. For me personally, it became a game-changer in turning scattered effort into consistent, profitable momentum.

**Is there a guarantee?**  
Yes, the program comes with a refund policy. If it doesn’t work for you, you can request your money back. That makes it a low-risk investment in your personal growth and productivity.",1,1755595303.0,ReviewDaily,0,1.0,False

If you're reaching for sleeping pills in desperation, I get it. But as someone who's been through the insomnia struggle, let me tell you: there's a better way.

Most sleeping pills don't give you real sleep - they just sedate you. The morning-after grogginess, the dependency, the rebound insomnia... it's just not worth it.

**What actually has helped me:**

**1. Magnesium Glycinate**  
Turns out I was deficient. This form of magnesium doesn’t cause digestive issues and acts like a natural relaxant for your nervous system. Started taking 400mg about an hour before bed and noticed it helped me feel calmer at bedtime.

**2. Sunlight First Thing**  
Not coffee. Not my phone. 10 minutes of morning sunlight (even on cloudy days) resets your circadian rhythm like nothing else. I think it helped boost my daytime energy too.

**3. Warm Lights After Sunset**  
Swapped all evening lights for amber bulbs. The brain can’t relax under blue white lights - this simple switch helps signal the body to wind down and prepare for sleep.

(Spoiler: You’re not alone.)

Last Thursday, I wasted 3 hours reconciling a BRD with Jira tickets while my devs waited. Then spent Friday manually drafting test cases. Sound familiar? 😮‍💨

Turns out there’s a better way. I’ve been quietly testing AIPO – and it feels like someone finally gave product teams a superpower:



✅ BRDs that actually stay synced with features

✅ Code descriptions that auto-link to requirements (no more ""why did we build this?"")

✅ Test cases generated from specs in 2 clicks

✅ Sprint planning that accounts for real team capacity

✅ Instant answers from your docs/knowledge base



Best part? It’s NOT another tab hell – works slick on mobile too (PWA magic ✨).



Why I’m hooked:

Instead of glueing 5 tools together, AIPO lets me:

Sketch a feature → auto-generate its BRD skeleton

Break it into sprint-ready tasks with role assignments

Spit out test cases while I grab coffee



Let devs search KB while coding



Real talk? It shaved 8 hours off my last release cycle. If you’re a PO, analyst, or tech lead drowning in documentation chaos – this might be your lifeline.



PS: They’re actively taking feedback (I sent mine!). If you test it, tell them what you need. Tools like this only get better when we shape them. 🙌

I don't know a lot about dementia (since I luckily don't personally know anyone with it), but I'm pretty sure being quick to anger can be a side effect of the illness (or maybe even a symptom?). Yet I occasionally see people mention their loved ones with dementia seeming pretty happy, telling others they don't know them but know they love them, etc. There's a woman with dementia who occasionally drinks coffee at the store I work at with her caretaker, and she seems pretty content and usually happy to be out and about. This got me wondering whether I'm just not seeing her bad moments, or maybe she's still in the early stages, or if there is legitimately some connection to quality of life before the diagnosis and how it looks later.

Review Inside!,"The COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker with item model number B0821DTMGT is a product I've been experimenting with recently, and as someone who values a great cup of coffee to kickstart each day, I was eager to see if it could elevate my morning ritual. With its 8-cup (34oz) capacity and a double-layer stainless steel filter, the device promised both functionality and an artisan touch. However, there’s always more to the story than just its glowing specifications. Let’s dive in.

**Design and Build Quality**

I couldn’t help but admire the aesthetic appeal of this coffee maker straight out of the box. With its borosilicate glass decanter and a polished wooden sleeve, it looks like something you’d find in a high-end café. The glass is notably thermal-resistant, which I’ve tested by placing it over a low stove flame to keep my coffee warm. The materials feel premium and weighty in the hand, especially the dual stainless steel filter, which has a reassuring sturdiness. However, the wooden sleeve, while beautiful, felt a bit cumbersome to clean if any coffee drips on it. Using a slightly damp cloth solved the issue, but it’s something to keep in mind.

**Ease of Use**

Being a manual device, this coffee maker puts the control squarely in your hands. From controlling water temperature to adjusting the concentration of coffee grounds, it felt like I was conducting a small science experiment each morning—a fun one, I should add. The included BPA-free scoop is surprisingly precise, making it easy to measure out just the right amount of coffee. While the setup may seem intimidating to someone used to automatic brewers, I found it intuitive after just two uses, and the learning curve is minimal.

**Highlights**

- The double-layer stainless steel filter ensures that no coffee grounds sneak their way into your beverage while allowing the natural oils to add richness.  
- The thermal-resistant borosilicate glass can handle low heat directly on the stove, making it versatile when you’re craving a second warm cup.  
- An 8-cup capacity ensures it’s ideal for when friends or family pop over unexpectedly.   

[Looking for COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker, B0821DTMGT deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0821dtmgt/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**

The end result was something that genuinely impressed me. Rich, full-bodied coffee with zero residue or unwanted bitterness was the consistent outcome. The dripping speed of the filter further enhances the flavor, as it’s not so slow that you lose patience, nor too fast to weaken the brew. I even tried iced coffee using this pour-over brewer, and the iced variant turned out to be just as satisfying, given the control over the coffee-to-water ratio.

However, it’s worth noting that the full process requires patience. You’re manually pouring and controlling the flow of water, which means this may not be ideal for anyone rushing to catch a train every morning. But if you find joy in the process of creating your ideal cup, this is where the COSORI model shines brightest.

**Strong Points**

- Dual-layer filter delivers clean and robust coffee flavors.  
- A reusable filter eliminates the need for single-use paper ones, making it eco-friendly.  
- Dishwasher-safe design for effortless cleanup (decantor and filter parts).  
- BPA-free components assure safety and health consciousness.  

**Areas of Concern**

- Wooden sleeve could require frequent maintenance if coffee spills on it.  
- Manual brewing process may frustrate users looking for speed over quality.  

**Competing Products**

In a market overflowing with pour-over coffee makers, a standout aspect of this product is its unique wooden handle combined with the borosilicate glass decanter. When comparing to products like the Chemex Classic Series, I’d say the COSORI model provides better durability due to its stainless steel filter—no paper waste, no extra costs. On the other hand, Chemex offers a sleeker design and that well-loved cork handle, but I’ve heard it doesn’t age well once it gets damp.

When put side by side with kitchen staples like the Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker, this COSORI variation edges ahead in filtration efficiency (thanks to its dual-layer filter) but lags slightly in the simplicity of maintenance, especially where the wooden sleeve is concerned.

**Value for Money**

Considering its combination of high-grade materials, excellent coffee filtration, and attention to artisanal detail, this product offers great bang for the buck. While not the cheapest, it justifies its cost by eliminating the need for disposable filters (a hidden money saver over time) and delivering a consistent café-level experience. Still, if you’re very price-sensitive or need a faster option, you might lean elsewhere.

In places like the Philippines or Malaysia in Asia, you can usually find stuff for about $40 to $80, which is cheaper because they're close to where it's made In the US and EU, you'll likely shell out about 20-30% extra, so think $70-$180 more because of import taxes and shipping stuff around. In Asia, you can usually find the best deals because stuff is made right there, so it's cheaper In China or Japan, where the rice cooker is a hit for making gohan, you can sometimes find them on sale for as low as $40.

I came to Australia in 2020 as a International Student driving of a fresh start and I thought I’d make something out of my life here but it’s five years and I feel like I have destroyed everything instead.

I started a science degree but couldn’t keep up with the unifees that collapsed and I feel like the complete failure. I switched to a business course and I’m struggling to finish it. I tell myself at least I’m still going but deep down I feel like I just wrecking myself through mud. I m in second last final semester. .

From 2022 to the end of 2023 I lived in depression. I barely recognise who I was in those years. It feels like my soul had left my body and I was just surviving even now. I still don’t feel whole.

I tried different parts to get out of it. I works  in Retail shop and I got an internship in consulting group in Melbourne. I always tried my best but I still feel like A kid in that world insecure like I don’t belong.

Financially, I’m drowning. Paycheck to paycheck sometimes I can’t even buy myself a simple coffee without a guilt. Rent stresses me out every single week. My family back home can’t help me so it’s it is just me .no support system .no one to fall back on around .other international students and at least they have partners boyfriends or families who can hold them when they fall. I have no one. I have met guys along the way but it never worked out. I used to cling to love as it would save me but all it gave me was more disappointment.

Now I’m 28 and what do I have? No degree yet no savings ,no stable job, no relationship ,nothing. I feel like a prisoner in my own life sometimes the darkest thoughts creep in ,that maybe I was not  meant to make it. maybe I am a mistake. Maybe the universe is punishing me. I call myself unlucky loser a fake person. I even look back at some choices I made during my hardest and feel ashamed. Like I lost control of who I was. I keep wondering if all of this is just karma chasing me, but I never done anything bad for anyone.

every day feels like a fight between wanting to keep going and wanting to give up. I don’t see achievements only failures. I keep asking myself if I should have to differently. Maybe I ruined my whole time.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. Has anyone else feel Like this? Like you have wasted life abd made bad choices. Lived with depression ,lost money and lost yourself and ended up with nothing.??

And if you have somehow crawled out of that place, how did you do it? How do you start again when you are already this far behind?",2,1755594246.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

This is true for various reasons. One of them is, that last year I initiated a talk about a specific situation that did not sit right with me and was met with a laundry list of her grievances about things that happened 2+ years ago at the time. I was not prepared, went into total freeze and became more withdrawn around her, as she rightly noticed.   
I do appreciate that she initiated to talk, but I am also scared. I would like to dive into some of the things that have made me feel more insecure around her. But I do not want to repeat what she did last year. So my question is: How can I bring up stuff without making it into a laundry list?  
  
Maybe an example will help: I always show up on time at her house, she is sometimes 1,5 hours late to my house. She brings her kids and seems to expect me to supervise them, while she is relaxing on the couch, drinking coffee and looking at her phone. While I do not mind hanging out with the kids and giving her a break, I do want her to step in when the kids jump on my bed or something.",1,1755594093.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

Also me: can’t figure out how to make adult friends.,"I came to Portugal (Braga) ready for the bureaucracy, the language barrier, and the logistical puzzle of unhitching from my life in the US. What I didn't expect was this feeling of floating socially between worlds I don't quite belong to.



Back home, community was almost a given. 20 years in the military and then another 10 as a teacher gave me ready-made networks. When those weren't available, I built my own - hiking groups, foodie meetups, professional circles.



I've also lived in cities notoriously hard for making friends, like Seattle and Las Vegas, so I'm no stranger to social challenges. But so far this feels like an entirely different experience. Finding people here is a skill I haven't been able to apply.



Here, that skill feels less useful. At 49, I’m in a weird social no-man’s-land. I've gone to Facebook and Whatsapp meetups and found myself the ""baby at the table,"" a good 15- 20 years younger than anyone else, as the conversation revolved around changes in social security and how to find a podiatrist. My one attempt to connect with the digital nomad crowd felt like I'd stumbled into a seminar on crypto-trading and content creation.



Neither feel like spaces I wanted to be in. The disconnect between these two groups is stark. Retirees are just in a different place in life and so are the digital nomads. I feel like I exist in a no-man’s-land between them, too old to fully relate to the nomads, too young (and restless) to fit in with the traditional retirees.



And then there's the reality of being a single parent doing this completely alone. My 11-year-old daughter is my first priority (and a big reason for the move given the social and political instability in the US), and we're exploring Portugal together, one park and *pastel de nata* at a time. Almost everyone I meet either has very young kids or is partnered up. Most of the guys seem to rely on their significant other to be the social butterfly—something I don’t have. I’m navigating this for both of us.



I've tried the normal playbook - Exchange numbers, hang out a few times, and make an effort to follow up, to invite them for coffee or dinner. It feels like a solid connection in the moment. Then, the messages just... stop. It's a humbling, and honestly, a confusing experience. The lack of a shared past or a ready-made community means every new connection feels fragile. I've also found that some of these connections feel transactional. I'd be trying to build a conversation, hoping to find a common interest or a deeper connection, but all they seemed to want was information on how to get a D7 visa or what insurance I'm using. It's draining.



For those of you who landed in Portugal and didn’t fit neatly into the typical expat boxes, how did you find your people? What were the unconventional step you took to build a community that felt right? Or did you have to reinvent your approach to friendship entirely?",11,1755594007.0,PortugalExpats,31,0.69,False

Got up

Woke up her daughter, 

Made bed got dressed, made breakfast... etc.

Victoria had become quite attached to her orb as most youngins do.  Getting her To make friends, let alone  do her routine has been challenging lately. 

The orb was taken away several times but this persists.


Victoria claims all her friends are over the orb. 


This has placed Mrs.tenpenny In an ethical dilemma.

Every time the orb was removed, Victoria would barely get out of bed.... if at all.


Orb given back, and she spends all her time and energy tapping, scrying, and ""roleplaying"" 


This problem plagued Mrs.tenpenny even during her time at work.

If the whole mana network goes down,  what good is that orb? 

It's like some new apocalypse comes every Monday, and it's just part of the monotony. 

Just this last week, she found out her microwave oven had been replaced with a mimic in a string of burglaries. Apparently other nations have been having this problem,  and linking it to blue helmets wizard corps activities.

Vermensk forces have been agitated trying to catch the terrorist who is doing this. 


""MRS.TENPENNY ""Mr. Wallace hollered. 

Mrs.tenpenny was on break.

""Whatcha need? I'm on break."" Mrs. Tenpenny replied from the break room, snapping out of deep contemplation. 



""You seem upset. Has anyone been giving you a hard time?"" Mirratus Inquired, expecting some workplace foul play was afoot.

""Just my daughter. I think she's become addicted to the orb."" Mrs.tenpenny explained before sipping balestone coffee. 

--------------


Mrs. Dime finally got the Adam's Apple Inn LLC set up. 

Repairs to the hotel in cattail city were paid by a business credit card in the company's name.  

Those would then be deducted from the company's taxes owed to the vermensk empire because the company calls this a business expense.


On Mondays, Wednesdays , and Fridays,  she did accounting work.

Business had been doing well enough to consider bringing up advertising with Adam and the other board member. 

By now, Adam and Mrs.tenpenny would each see 2,045 or so gold in their accounts. 

Every now and again,  she orbstalks her daughter, Victoria. 

Apparently she's very active on casstit.orb

""Someday, we will see each other again."" Whispered Mrs Dime, the original Mrs.tenpenny.


Current board proposals,  


-add slot machines in the lobby

-hire more workers

-hire an entertainer so Mrs. Dime can focus on helping Adam run the fucking hotel.

-build a swimming pool with a wet bar on the roof.

I am 6 weeks pp and for the last 2 weeks I have cut out sugar from my diet as I was frankly annoyed at my c section overhang and the delayed recovery because of it and started watching what I eat.

I thought losing weight while EBF was a myth as last time around I was stuck 30 lbs heavier than in my late 20s and I just assumed this was me from now. I am not actively trying to lose weight because I know that can impact supply (so far it doesn’t seem to have impacted mine, though).

I make lovely plates for my toddler and started making them for me too and I guess that’s paid off. I am unexpectedly down 8lbs in 2 weeks and almost at my pre-pregnancy weight of 175lbs and would still have another 30 to go to get to my goal weight of around 150 lbs at 5‘7 which I wanted to reach 1 year postpartum. Slow and steady and all that…I guess not?!

I started to have overnight oats again with fruit & honey, lots of veggies and fruits for when the snacking instinct kicks in or some nuts and no more added sugar or syrup in my coffee and tea and we cut out basically all junk foods. I am basically eating the way I did before becoming a mom and being tired and stressed all the time and reaching for quick meals. I feel full and satiated and I drink lots of water to keep up with hydration and my newborn is gaining weight steadily. 

I reckon the weight loss will slow down at some point? I am not calorie counting but simply making healthy choices but I didn’t except the drop off to be so severe while still being pretty inactive with a newborn feeding schedule. 

Guess I am just looking for others who may have experienced similar weight loss and if this was sustained? For reference I was 200lbs just before delivery and am now at 178.

Fiber helps you feel fuller for longer, reducing the temptation to snack or overeat. Plus, it supports digestion, ensuring your body efficiently processes food and eliminates waste.

For many people, hitting the daily recommended fiber intake through food alone can be tough—that's where **fiber supplements** come in. Supplements, like **psyllium husk** and **inulin**, provide an easy way to get the fiber your body needs without dramatically changing your diet.

# How Fiber Supports Weight Loss

Wondering how **fiber** aids in weight loss? It’s simple:

●       **Fiber helps with appetite control**, digestion, and maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.

●       When you consume fiber, it absorbs water and swells in your stomach, keeping you feeling full for longer. This means you're less likely to grab snacks between meals, naturally reducing your calorie intake without feeling deprived.

●       It also supports digestion by promoting regular bowel movements, which prevents bloating and helps your body eliminate waste efficiently.

●       Additionally, some fibers, like **psyllium husk** and **inulin**, act as prebiotics, feeding the good bacteria in your gut, which can positively impact your metabolism.

●       Certain types of fiber can also **stabilize blood sugar levels**, which helps to avoid insulin spikes that lead to fat storage.

●       If you're incorporating exercise into your routine, having stable energy from fiber can help you perform better during workouts, further enhancing calorie burn.

Fiber supplements are a great addition to a weight loss plan because they help you feel full longer, control cravings, and support digestion. Products like [**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php) and [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) stand out for their effective fiber content, with HourGlass Fit providing glucomannan for appetite suppression and Phen using nopal cactus fiber to curb hunger and aid fat burning.

However, while *ColonBroom Premium* is a popular fiber supplement I don’t think it deserves a place on the list due to the availability of better options.

1mucvzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LettersToStrangers/comments/1mucvzr/what_this_quiet_feeling_of_hope_means_to_me/,What This Quiet Feeling of Hope Means to Me,"Dear Stranger,

I get this weird, quiet hope sometimes—like when you're watching the sun slowly breaking dawn and everything seems posible for no reason at all. It creeps up on me when I'm sipping my morning coffee, and suddenly, life feels a bit more doable. It's not about big dreams or grand plans. It's more of a gentle whisper saying maybe today won't be so bad.

I thnik it's kinda tied to finding joy in samll tnings. Like, the other day, my playlist shuffled to that one old song I hadn't heard in forveer, and it hit me right in the feels. Or when my cat curled up against me at just the right moment. 

This hope, I guess, is abput believing that tiny pieces of happiiness can string together into something a bit more sold. I don't always get it right, and there are days when it all fees too heavy, but still... there's this hope haning around, reminding me to keep showing up.

Do you ever get that? That small flicker telling you to hang on a little longer? 

Anyway, just thought I'd share this with whoever mihgt be reading. Maybe you're feeling it too.

\
Alt text: Business people in a professional meeting in Bahrain Financial Harbour. also reported a 21% surge in new investor visa applications from Q1 2024 to Q1 2025, especially from tech, logistics, and professional services sectors.\
And I’ve watched this firsthand: from busy Tamkeen events in the Diplomatic Area to the friendly, pragmatic staff at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (MOICT) registration counters.\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi: The Investor’s Edge\
\
Importantly: Unlike Dubai or Riyadh, Bahrain offers faster company setup, 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, and streamlined dependent visa approvals—no local sponsor required in many cases (see details). If you’ve ever faced UAE’s labyrinthine PRO processes, Bahrain feels like a relief.\
\
Investor Visa Basics: The Family Question\
Bahrain’s investor visa (sometimes called an “Investor Residence Permit”) offers clear pathways for dependents. The main applicant (company owner/partner) can sponsor their spouse, children, and—in specific circumstances—parents or domestic staff. The process links directly with your company’s legal standing and ongoing compliance.\
Who Qualifies as Family?\
\
Spouse (husband/wife)\
Children (usually up to 24 years old for males, unmarried for females)\
Parents (case-by-case, subject to Immigration approval)\
Domestic helpers (if employment is justified)\
\
Step-By-Step: Bringing Your Family on an Investor Visa\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: paperwork and office workflow.:\
1. Establish Your Bahrain Company\
\
Choose a legal structure (WLL, SPC, branch, foreign company). Compare options.\
Register with Sijilat: Bahrain’s digital commercial registration (process guide).\
Obtain Commercial Registration (CR) and requisite sector approvals (MOICT, EDB).\
\
Tip: For tech and consultancy startups, the Bahrain Bay and Seef District offices offer the fastest Sijilat processing. I once waited nearly four hours at the Salmaniya branch while a peer, filing in Bahrain Bay, finished in just 35 minutes.\
2. Secure the Investor Visa\
\
Apply at the Nationality, Passports and Residence Affairs (NPRA) with your company’s CR and supporting documents.\
Documents required: CR, Memorandum of Association, lease agreement, bank reference, passport copies, recent passport-sized photos.\
(Always double-check with bahrain.com for the latest forms.)\
\
3. Apply for Family Dependent Visas\
\
Submit dependent visa applications at NPRA or via the LMRA’s online portal.\
Documents needed: Marriage certificate (attested), children’s birth certificates, proof of income, tenancy contract.\
\
Insider shortcut: Have all certificates attested before arrival—Bahrain accepts only officially attested documents, and embassy queues can be painfully long during Ramadan or public holidays.\
4. Complete Medical and Biometrics\
\
Family members must undergo medical checks at approved clinics. The LMRA’s new 2025 e-booking system reduced average waiting time to one day (previously a week).\
\
5. Receive and Activate Residence Permits\
\
Residence cards (Smart ID) are issued at NPRA’s main desk in Sanabis. For faster issuance, mornings before 9:30 am are best—I’ve seen lines snake out the door by noon.\
\
What About Dependents’ Rights?\
Dependents can:\
- Live, study, and access private healthcare in Bahrain.\
- Not legally work unless the employer sponsors a separate work permit through LMRA.\

\
Which Business Structure Is Best for Family Sponsorship?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration for Bahrain company setup. or SPC (Single Person Company) is the fastest to process and fully foreign-owned (read more about 100% foreign ownership). Free zones—like Bahrain Logistics Zone or Bahrain International Investment Park—provide additional perks, including reduced CR fees and flexible office requirements (explore free zone options).\
A common mistake? Entrepreneurs often default to a local sponsorship structure unnecessarily, locking themselves into profit-sharing or co-signatory restrictions. Only use a local sponsor if your activity requires it (full details).\
Insider Tips: Streamlining the Process\
\
Best time to apply: Avoid Ramadan and the last week of December (public offices close early or are understaffed).\
Top office locations: Bahrain Bay (fastest CR issuance), Seef District (least crowded NPRA counter), Diplomatic Area (quick document notarization at the Justice Ministry).\
Pre-approval shortcuts: Tamkeen’s startup packages can help you skip the general business plan review step for qualifying industries.\
Document hacks: Digitize all files (PDF + scan) and store in a named Dropbox/Google Drive folder—you’ll need to re-upload several times for Sijilat, LMRA, and banking.\
Networking: Attend a majlis at a local business chamber; introductions here can mean faster approvals and invaluable advice. (My first Sijilat “expedite” came after a casual coffee with a Bahraini partner’s cousin during a Ramadan networking event.)\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: What’s New?\
From January 2025, Bahrain introduced a mandatory e-signature protocol for all dependent visa applications via Sijilat. All supporting documents must be digitally signed using the NPRA’s new “eTamper” verification. While it’s more secure, it does require pre-registration at the Central Informatics Organization (CIO)—plan an extra 2–3 days for this.\
The LMRA also now vets dependent visa renewals for school enrollment verification—if your children attend a non-accredited private school, expect questions. (Get the latest government updates here)\
Compliance and Aftercare\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: signing contracts and legal paperwork in Bahrain.)\
- Ensure dependents remain covered by health insurance (mandatory since October 2024)\
\
Bahrain’s Sijilat auto-reminder system saves time—set up SMS/email notifications for license, visa, and insurance expirations.\
\
Professional Support: Why It Helps\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for Bahrain company formation and expat services. have earned my trust for transparent fees, English-Arabic support, and real-world answers to thorny questions (they helped me navigate a tricky CR reclassification in 2023). If you’re new to local customs—a strong handshake, honorific titles, and accepting coffee even if you don’t drink it—consider a professional to ease your path.\
\
Tangent: Ramadan Adjustments and Business Rhythms\
During Ramadan, business hours contract, and festive gatherings replace late-evening meetings. The MOICT and LMRA desks close by 2:00 pm. Family visa processing slows noticeably, yet the social circuit opens up. Some of my best government contacts were made sharing iftar dates and stories about Gulf entrepreneurship. So, schedule your document runs for early morning—and don’t skip the networking!\
Bahrain Business FAQ: Family Visas and Beyond\
Q1: Can my children attend public schools in Bahrain on a dependent visa?\
No, only Bahraini citizens access public K–12. Expat children enroll in private/international schools. Be prepared for early registration and high competition for top spots.\
Q2: What if my spouse wants to work in Bahrain?\
Your spouse must secure a separate employment contract and LMRA work permit; the dependent visa does not permit paid employment. Some sectors fast-track spouse hiring through ‘family sponsorship to employment’ conversions (details here).\
Q3: If I relocate my company, do my family’s visas remain valid?\
Only if your Bahrain CR and investor visa remain active. Company closure or license suspension cancels all dependent permits.\
Q4: Can I include my parents or in-laws under my investor visa?\
Generally, only direct parents are eligible, and each case is reviewed individually. Prepare to show proof of dependency, medical insurance, and financial support.\
Q5: What if I make a mistake in my application?\
Small errors can cause long delays. Use a vetted service provider (see options), double-check all forms, and—if in doubt—visit MOICT in person. A face-to-face explanation at the Seef District office once saved me a two-week wait.\

I met this guy at an bar event during the weekend. I'm a woman and we are both in our late 20's. I don't date much and usually don't go up to men, but for some reason decided to approach him. I got a really good vibe and thought we connected. We danced for a little bit and talked in between as well. I made out with him pretty heavily and it felt good and nice.

We exchanged numbers and seperated for a bit. Toward the night I told him to come meet me at this other bar that I had moved to and there we danced a bit more and was grabbing me a lot. Touching my hips and stomach and grabbing my butt a little but not in a way that felt predatory just like idk good vibes. We also sat down to talk for like maybe 10 minutes but then I had to go.

The next day he texted me and I told him that I had a pretty long and busy day ahead and ended not getting to really sit and be on my phone till like 2 am. I think because of the time and obviously how we met he must have thought that I was texting him with an agenda because he turned the convo sexual pretty soon.

This is where everything starts going wrong. I was happy to participate but when he asked for pictures I said ""I'm shy"" and I'm just like.... why would I grown woman say that? Why would I say that? Like yes I was not going to send pics because I well I AM shy and I don't really wanna yet, but I could have said it in a way that didn't make me sound like a 14 year old.

The convo didn't necessary end there and honestly I was appreciative that he moved past it without like being a sore loser about it, but idk. The vibe today was like I had to text him in the afternoon and I was asking the questions and keeping the conversations going.

I'm starting to realize that maybe I was wrong. I assumed that because we had conversations that seemed like we were connecting, he wasn't only interested in a sexual connection. Obviously it was part of it and I'm open to that, but now I'm starting to think that it might be the ONLY thing he's interested in and I'm a bit disappointed. He seemed like such a good vibe and while we were dancing and exchanging numbers and talking there was brief mention of grabbing coffee or drinks and getting to know each other. Do we think that was just saying what he knew I wanted to hear? I like to think that I can feel when people are being genuine, and he felt very genuine.

He could have lost interest because I came across ass childish when I said ""I'm shy"" or needy when I was texting him this afternoon. Idk it's literally too soon to worry about this. I mean I don't even know him and the fact that I'm even feeling like i need to know what it's gonna be RIGHT now is just like my me being a little bit crazy. I just like don't know how to navigate these things because I don't really date and I feel weird and childish and stupid and I can't stop overthinking about it even though I know it's literally not that deep.

Should I maintain hope that he might be actually interested in me as a person or just call it a wrap and focus on deciding if I want to go forward with this hook up because that's all it sounds like it's gonna be?",1,1755592690.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False
1muctf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1muctf2/my_leanbean_review_for_weight_loss_leanbean_vs/,My LeanBean review for weight loss: LeanBean vs Hourglass Fit,"# Quick Summary

I've reviewed plenty of weight loss supplements, so I know my way around these things. LeanBean has a good lineup of ingredients, and while it won’t work miracles, it can be a solid addition if you're already on the right path with diet and exercise. **I’d rate it at 3.5 / 5.**

If you’re weighing your options, I recommend [**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php) (3000 mg glucomannan, best non stimulant fat burner) and [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) (More focus on thyroid, multiple angles of appetite suppression & weight loss, blood sugar management) over **LeanBean**, both rated at **4.5 / 5**.

**Where LeanBean helps:**

The **glucomannan** is a standout ingredient. This is a natural fiber from konjac root that swells in your stomach, making you feel fuller, so you naturally eat less. I've personally used glucomannan before, and it really helped curb my hunger when I was trying to cut down on snacking. But keep in mind, it’s not magic—if you’re not eating right, you’ll still struggle.

If you’ve got a lifestyle in place where you’re eating in a calorie deficit, this can help make that process easier. Plus, the studies support that glucomannan, combined with a proper diet, can lead to weight loss​.

Then there’s **green coffee bean extract**. It’s got chlorogenic acid, which is thought to reduce fat absorption and improve how your body uses glucose. It’s not super strong, but it might give you a slight edge when it comes to metabolism. Again, this is one of those ingredients that can provide a *small* boost, but it’s not going to make the pounds melt off unless you're putting in the effort​ with workouts etc.

I’ve also seen **turmeric** popping up in a lot of supplements lately, probably because of its anti-inflammatory properties. It’s not directly related to weight loss, but it can help if inflammation has been holding you back in terms of recovery or metabolism. If you're into holistic health, turmeric could be a nice bonus.

**Where it’s lacking:**

LeanBean markets itself toward women, but there’s not much here that’s specifically gender-focused. **Garcinia Cambogia** is one of those ingredients I’ve tried in the past and honestly didn’t see much difference. It’s supposed to block fat production, but most of the hype around it is pretty inflated. I wouldn’t rely on it too much if you're looking for a major fat-burning effect

The dose of **green coffee bean** and **turmeric** here is also on the lower side. Based on what I’ve read and seen, these doses are more about supporting your overall wellness rather than directly causing significant weight loss.

**Acai berry** is nice for antioxidants, but at 6.67 mg, I’d say it’s more of a “filler” than a powerhouse ingredient.

Overall, if you're looking for a natural supplement to *help* you stay on track, LeanBean might be worth a shot, but don't expect miracles. I’d rate it about 3.5 out of 5. It’s good for suppressing appetite and giving you some energy to stay motivated, but it won’t replace a solid workout routine and proper diet.

If you're considering this, just know that your results will still mostly depend on the work you put in.

**What I recommend**

If you’re weighing your options, I’d recommend giving HourGlass Fit or Phen a shot over LeanBean.

[**HourGlass Fit**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/hourglassfit.php)  stands out as the one of the best non-stimulant fat burners, thanks to its whopping **3000 mg of glucomannan**, which helps control hunger better than LeanBean's dose. It’s perfect if you want something effective without the jitters.

On the other hand, [**Phen**](https://wholesomehealth.cc/out/phenq2.php) takes a more well-rounded approach, targeting multiple angles of weight loss, including boosting thyroid function and managing blood sugar, which can help with energy levels and fat burning.

Both of these options are more powerful, offering more comprehensive benefits than LeanBean, and I’d give them a solid 4.5 out of 5.

 

**Pros of LeanBean:**

●       **Natural appetite suppressant**: Uses **glucomannan**, a fiber that swells in your stomach to help control cravings and keep you feeling full longer.

●       **Non-stimulant**: No jittery caffeine crashes, making it ideal for people sensitive to stimulants.

●       **Tailored for women**: Specifically designed to target cravings and support metabolism in women, which can help with long-term weight management.

●       **Energy support without overstimulation**: Contains ingredients like turmeric and green coffee bean extract that support metabolism without overloading your system.

●       **Vegan-friendly**: Made with all-natural, plant-based ingredients, suitable for a wide range of dietary preferences.

●       **Money-back guarantee**: 90-day money-back guarantee, offering a risk-free trial period.

**Cons of LeanBean:**

●       **Low dosage of some ingredients**: Ingredients like **turmeric** and **green coffee bean extract** are present in low amounts, which may limit their fat-burning potential.

●       **Glucomannan-dependent**: While glucomannan is effective, results largely depend on how well your body responds to this fiber.

●       **Limited fat-burning impact**: Doesn't contain strong thermogenic ingredients, which may not be ideal if you're looking for rapid fat burning.

●       **Requires consistent use with diet**: Works best when combined with a calorie-controlled diet and regular exercise; it won’t work alone.

●       **Not a miracle solution**: Like most natural fat burners, it won’t replace a healthy lifestyle—diet and exercise remain crucial for results.

# How to use appetite suppressants like LeanBean, Hourglass Fit

If you're trying to lose weight using appetite suppressants like LeanBean, HourGlass Fit, or Phen, there are a few key tips to make them work for you. First, focus on eating high-protein meals and avoiding simple carbs, which can cause blood sugar spikes and make it harder to control your hunger.

These supplements, especially with ingredients like glucomannan, help you feel full, but you'll need to combine them with a diet rich in protein and vegetables to maximize their effectiveness. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is crucial too, as sometimes hunger is actually thirst.

It's also a good idea to **try intermittent fasting** or **reducing your caloric intake** in the morning, allowing you to save more calories for the evening, which can prevent **late-night snacking.** Supplements like these can be more effective when paired with a consistent routine that includes daily activity, whether it’s intentional cardio or simply walking more.

For extra appetite control, consider adding fiber powder before meals or even using stimulants like caffeine in moderation to suppress hunger and boost energy​

I used to have that ""Kakayanin"" mindset, pero now na money is involved, I feel so burnt out and I feel so stagnant at napapagiwanan na ng panahon. I don't have time rin since yung freelance work ko is multimedia work rin. The last time I felt na I was going somewhere was after-ish the pandemic, I was working as a barista to help with my tuition and allowances, slowly got hired as the coffee shop's sole multimedia artist haha.

Is it just me... or did anyone else totally sleep on the fact that we're living in THIS timeline—where there are legit apps, real actual APPS, that just straight up pay you to test NEW features?!

I'm not even kidding, I fell down this rabbit hole last night and—my brain can't comprehend how simple (and kinda fun?) this is. These companies are so thirsty for user input it’s getting wild. But the best part? We're finally getting paid for our curiosity.

After poking through every dark corner of the app store, user reviews, and a load of Reddit threads... I pulled together the **Top 7 Legit Apps That Pay You to Test New Features in 2025**.  

Some of these are borderline mind-blowing. Ready? I swear I’m not making this up:

- **BetaTesting (betatesting.com)**  
Getting into this is easier than you think—sign up, get notified about projects, and boom! There are people LITERALLY earning $10-$40 per test. Am I dreaming??

- **uTest**  
Flexibility on steroids. You pick what projects you want, you control your schedule (I know, right?), and the cash roll in for testing everything from apps to smart kettles.

- **Testbirds**  
Europeans, rise up! These folks are *global*—and the cash isn’t bad, especially if you’re a tech geek crushing bugs and writing feedback.

- **Userlytics**  
Short. Sweet. Dead simple. Honestly, try **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** right now to see a similar testing experience, they sometimes offer $5-$90 per gig. Mind officially blown.

- **GoodNovel TestApp**  
Wait. STOP. Go to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (no, seriously, it pays!). Not many know you can test unreleased features for them, and they pay PER session. Wild.

- **PlaytestCloud**  
Gamers, don’t sleep on this. You actually get paid—like, real money—for testing new mobile games, giving live reactions (as weird as it sounds, you talk while you play).

- **UserTesting**  
The OG. Pays you for honest feedback—sometimes as quick as a 20-minute test and the money appears like magic. Start now on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and you’ll see what I mean.

---

But here’s the thing that literally made me spit out my coffee:  
Some of these apps PAY INSTANTLY, like after you finish just one test?! Does this feel too good to be true? Or am I living in a simulation?

Is anyone else just as SHOCKED by the cash possibilities here?

You try out something, find bugs, say how you *really* feel about the new designs/features—and BOOM $$$!

If you want the quickest start possible, I swear by **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (don’t say I didn’t warn you—you’ll get hooked).

It's a rollercoaster through history, economics, engineering, and why Bitcoin isn't just ""magic internet money""—it's the key to fixing half the world's problems. Saylor drops bombs like comparing inflation to bleeding George Washington to death (spoiler: it didn't end well for the prez). If you're into BTC, big-picture thinking, or just love a good intellectual smackdown on flawed economic models, this is gold (or should I say, digital gold?).

I transcribed and summarized the highlights below to make it engaging—it's long, but trust me, it's worth the read. Grab a coffee, dive in, and let's discuss in the comments: Is Saylor onto something revolutionary, or is this just maxi hype? What's your take on inflation as a ""vector"" screwing the working class?

# The Hook: George Washington's Tragic End as an Inflation Metaphor

Saylor kicks off with a killer analogy: Remember how docs ""helped"" George Washington by bleeding him to death? That's like modern economists inflating the money supply at 7% but calling it 2% to ""boost"" the economy. It's bleeding the free market dry, and most folks go along with it thinking it's for their own good. Oof—hits different in 2025 with inflation still raging. Saylor argues defective mental models are killing us slowly.

# Grading Humanity: We're Okay at Rockets, Terrible at Economics

When future aliens/AI look back at us:

* **Engineering/Hard Sciences: B-** We're nailing rockets, jets, electric cars, nukes. Shoutout to Newton, Einstein, Curie—MIT walls are full of legends. Human life expectancy jumped from 32 (Revolutionary War era) to 80 thanks to tech like antibiotics and energy harnessing (oil, electricity, dams). Politicians? Meh—a wash of good/bad ideas.
* **Economics: D- or F+** Most econ ideas are trash. Inflation isn't a single number—it's an ""n-dimensional vector"" (fancy for: prices change differently for assets, goods, locations). Economists use scalars like CPI (now 7.9%), ignoring asset hyperinflation (houses up 19% YoY). Result? Wealth shifts from workers to the elite, free markets die.

Saylor's roast: We model fluid dynamics for ship hulls with complex math, but econ? Basic arithmetic. Time for simulations, multi-variate models, and ditching linear BS.

# Inflation: The Silent Killer (Not What You Think)

* CPI is a ""synthetic basket"" governments tweak (hedonic adjustments = downgrading expectations, e.g., smaller apartments = no inflation 🙄).
* Assets (stocks, bonds, houses, Bitcoin) inflate fastest—bond market hyperinflated in minutes during 2020 rate drops.
* Real inflation? \~7% yearly for 100 years (S&P 10% returns mostly from money printing, not growth). Your house from 1930? Up 305x ($100k to $30M).
* Expansion of money supply = ""adiabatic lapse"" (energy leaking from the system). Like bleeding 10% of your blood before a workout—you perform worse.
* Governments inflate to fund policies/wars (never with taxes—too transparent/painful). Result: Inefficiency, power shifts to central control.

Fun fact: Velocity of money isn't scalar—it's medium-dependent (crypto: 10,000x faster than consumer economy).

# Human Civilization: Engineers vs. Politicians

* We're apex predators/engineers harnessing energy (fire, water, wind, oil, nukes). Cities on water? Free energy/transport/waste removal.
* Ships like the Dutch East India models? Symbols of exploration, risk, hope. Cannons? Power via tech (from spears to artillery).
* Wars reset, but drive innovation (organized societies win). Paradigm shifts via death of old guard or crises.
* Digital wave 1: Info (books, music, maps → Wikipedia, Google). Exothermic—massive prosperity (trillion-dollar cos like Apple/Amazon).
* Digital wave 2: Energy (Bitcoin = dematerialized property). Move $1B at light speed, zero friction. Immortal, incorruptible.

Saylor's vision: Fix economics/money = solve 50% of civilization's problems ($500T worth).

# Bitcoin: Digital Property/Energy Revolution

* BTC = crypto asset network for pure cyberspace energy. Ethical (property, not security—no CEO/board control).
* Layers: L1 (bedrock: immortality, big transfers), L2 (Lightning: fast/cheap), L3 (exchanges: millisec/free, custodial).
* Volatility? Decreasing; attracts capital, but institutions stabilize (MicroStrategy started the trend in 2020).
* Adoption: Embryonic (year 2 institutional). Governments? Inevitable (shocks like Ukraine/Russia sanctions push commodity strategies).
* Price: $1M+ per coin (digital gold → property → energy; $10T to $100T+ market cap).
* No second best? BTC king of property. Stablecoins (Tether) for currency. Ethereum/Solana for platforms (but regulatory risks loom).

Saylor on Elon: Supportive (Tesla holds BTC), but environmental FUD tweets distracted. Dogecoin? Fun speculation/meme, not institutional.

# Life Advice & Meaning

* For young folks: Focus energy, guard time, train mind/body, think independently, curate friends/environment, keep promises, stay cheerful, upgrade the world.
* Mortality: Endow ideas (Saylor Academy for free education). Engineer divine—leave the world better. To engineer is to channel energy beautifully/functionally.
* Meaning: Harness energy, build (ships, bridges, orchards, BTC). Repay ancestors by fixing what's in front of you. Entertainment + ethics + creation.

Whew, that's the gist—transcript is massive, but these nuggets blew my mind. Saylor's an engineering poet; Lex asks killer questions.

**Discussion Questions:**

* Is inflation really ""bleeding the economy""? How's it hitting you personally?
* BTC as ""digital energy""—game-changer or hype? Will it hit $1M by 2030?
* Governments adopting BTC: Yay or regulatory nightmare?
* Favorite quote? Mine: ""To engineer is divine.""",1,1755592075.0,Hx_life,0,1.0,False

1muclxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1muclxp/help_delonghi_rivelia_espresso_machine_sudden/,HELP: De’Longhi Rivelia Espresso Machine – Sudden Bitter Taste and No Crema,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping someone here can help me troubleshoot an issue with my De’Longhi Rivelia espresso machine. Before I went on holiday, it made perfect coffee with a nice crema on top. Now, after coming back, the coffee is consistently very bitter and there’s no crema at all.

I googled common issues and tried a few things, with no success or noticeable changes

* Changed the coffee beans and tried different types.
* Descaled the machine.
* Fully cleaned the interior following the manual instructions.
* Adjusted the grind size from 1 to 7.
* Tweaked the temperature settings.

Despite all these efforts, the coffee remains bitter and with almost no crema. Has anyone else experienced something similar with this machine or have any other suggestions on what to try next? Thanks in advance!

1mucjvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gurgaon/comments/1mucjvn/looking_for_something_real/,Looking for something real,"Hey, first time posting so I’ll try to keep this short.

About me: 27(m), working in tech in Gurgaon . Quiet, low-drama guy who prefers cafes, long walks, lazy Sundays and real conversations over parties and small talk. I tinker with photography, 3D design and tiny web/homelab projects. I spent the last few years building skills and hobbies, so I’m kinda new to dating and I’m ready to actually try.

Why I’m here: I tried the apps and they felt shallow and hookup-heavy. Weekends have been mostly me rotting in bed and scrolling, and I want to change that. Looking for something real, slow build and honest, not casual hookups.

What I’m like: Calm and thoughtful, I listen more than I talk
Loyal and low-drama
Into one on one stuff: tea/coffee, parks, long walks, late night talks
Creative and curious, I like building things and learning random skills New-ish to dating but sincere about it

Looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature, curious, and into a slow-build vibe. No hookups, no games.

If this sounds like you, say hi and tell me one of these: your favourite cafe, an ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. Reply or DM, whatever you prefer. No pressure, no pics required up front.

Thanks for reading. Posting this felt like progress. 🙂",1,1755591626.0,gurgaon,10,0.56,False
1muciis,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1muciis/ndad_is_being_sent_to_a_home/,NDad is being sent to a home.,"I haven't spoken to my father in over ten years. The last time I did it was over the phone when I cut him off, saying that if he couldn't have a civil conversation with me I'd hang up the phone. He couldn't so I hung up and blocked his number.

All these years later and my oldest sister keeps me informed on what's going on with him. She doesn't speak to him either but our middle sister does, so oldest gets news from the middle and passes it to me. I don't speak to my middle sister for other reasons. But my older sister told me all the following news as a gift for my birthday, because she knew I'd like it.

Some background, NDad lives with my shitty uncle and they deserve each other. They're both terrible people. Anyway their neighbors noticed NDad outside acting strange. Uncle had noticed him being odd but didn't care, he only wanted to argue over money meant to buy cheap coffee. 

NDad went to the hospital, diagnosed with severe heat stroke while tending to his garden. 

He got treatment and sent home where he and uncle immediately began arguing over the coffee money from before.Then NDad was found collapsed by their landlord a few days later when he went over to do repairs. Back to the hospital, and the diagnosis from what I understand is so karmically appropriate I feel terrible for laughing every time. 

NDad was suffering from malnutrition so extreme it began to affect his brain. All he'd been doing was drinking and not taking care of himself. 

A day after that, shitty uncle was ALSO found on the ground and sent to the hospital. He acted so insane there he was put in an indefinite psychiatric hold. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried. Now neither of them can go home with one another, and my middle sister is trying to get NDad in a care facility near her a few states away from where he lives now. He can't live on his own anymore and needs full time care.

I don't feel bad in saying that this news was an amazing birthday present. I'm still glowing over it. Both of them were giant pieces of shit their entire lives, and now everything is coming to a head. I don't know why my middle sister feels like she owes them any help, they were terrible to her too, but whatever helps her sleep at night. I won't say anything to her or interfere. 

I feel bad for all the medical staff that had to deal with them. They have my condolences.

But I'll just sit here with my popcorn and enjoy the show.",1,1755591480.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1mucghd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mucghd,Dialing grind for small Vietnamese phin (G7) with Indian robusta - weak/fast brew issue,"**Goal:** Get the classic **strong, punchy iced latte** from a **small Vietnamese G7 phin** using **Indian robusta (Ainmane “Robusta of Coorg”, medium roast)**.

**Setup**
- Small G7 phin (~4 oz basket)
- Coffee: Ainmane “Robusta of Coorg” (medium roast robusta, pure powder)
- Method I tried: two-pass phin, ~16 g coffee + 80 g water each, ~45 s bloom, brewed hot over ice + milk + condensed milk.

**What happened**
- Both passes finished *too fast* (≈2–3 min total).  
- Flow was not centered, it dripped from the **sides** of the basket.  
- End result: weak, watery taste (not creamy or punchy).

**Ask**
- With this **small G7 basket**, do I just need to grind *much finer* (closer to moka/near-espresso, table-salt texture) to slow it to ~4:30–5:30 total drip?  
- Or is the filter size itself the real limitation — meaning I should switch to a **larger phin** if I want a strong 400 ml iced latte?  

**Attachments:**  
- Close-up of the grounds (texture)  
- Coffee packet photo (Ainmane robusta)
- Phin",2,1755591254.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
