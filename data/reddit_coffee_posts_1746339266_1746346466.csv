We've been through a lot together, and I've always thought of her as someone I could truly rely on. But lately, I‚Äôve been feeling really hurt and let down by her.

My grandmother, who I live with and care for full-time, has been diagnosed with cancer. It‚Äôs been an incredibly difficult and emotional time for me. She‚Äôs been hospitalized multiple times, sometimes for long periods, and right now she‚Äôs in the hospital again. As her primary carer, I‚Äôm the one juggling everything such as her appointments, hospital visits, emotional support alongside my career while trying to hold myself together.

Each time she‚Äôs been admitted, I‚Äôve let my best friend know what‚Äôs going on. She lives very close to both me and the hospital only a few minutes away. Despite that, she‚Äôs never once offered to come over, help in any way, or even just visit my grandmother at the hospital. She hasn‚Äôt checked in with me beyond the occasional text, and even those feel a bit detached or obligatory.

What really stings is that despite everything I‚Äôve been juggling, when I found out that another friend‚Äôs mother was in the hospital, I immediately made time to bring them dinner and visit. I didn‚Äôt think twice I just wanted to make things a little easier for them during a tough time. So I guess it hurts even more that someone I consider my best friend hasn‚Äôt made a single effort.

I‚Äôm not expecting her to drop everything and be at my side 24/7. I know people have their own lives and stresses. But a small gesture even something like offering to bring me a coffee, coming by to sit and talk, or just asking how I‚Äôm really doing would go such a long way. I‚Äôve always tried to be there for her in the past when she was going through tough times, so this silence is hard to ignore.

I keep wondering if I‚Äôm expecting too much from her. Is it unreasonable to want that kind of support from a best friend when you‚Äôre going through something this heavy? Or is it fair to feel disappointed and even a bit abandoned?",1,1746346406.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1keesfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1keesfr/i_told_everyone_it_was_an_accident_but_every/,"I told everyone it was an accident. But every night, I still hear my sister crying from the living room.","Hi Reddit. I‚Äôve never posted anything before. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm doing this now, or what I‚Äôm hoping for‚Äîmaybe I just can‚Äôt carry it anymore. It‚Äôs been three years, and I haven‚Äôt told a soul. Not a therapist. Not a friend. No one.

But I hear her every night. And I think‚Ä¶ she wants me to talk.

So here it is.

Three years ago, I was 18. My sister Anne was 16. We were home alone for the weekend. Our parents had gone to Bangalore for work‚Äîtypical. They never really paid attention to us anyway. Me and Anne, we fought like most siblings, but that night‚Ä¶ something snapped.

She found something out. Something about me. Something I‚Äôd hidden from our mom. And she told her.

That night, I confronted Anne in the living room. It was late‚Äîstorm outside, thunder shaking the windows. Shadows everywhere. We were screaming at each other.

I don‚Äôt remember the exact words anymore. Just the anger.

I grabbed her arm when she tried to walk away. She pushed me.

I pushed back.

She tripped.

Her head hit the sharp corner of the coffee table.

It made a sound I‚Äôll never forget.

She just‚Ä¶ crumpled. Didn‚Äôt even cry. Just collapsed. Her head was bleeding‚Äîfast. I froze. I dropped to my knees, tried to shake her, call her name.

But she wasn‚Äôt breathing.

That‚Äôs when everything‚Ä¶ shut down. Like my brain split off from my body.


Then I went upstairs. I cleaned the blood. Hid the broken lamp. Sat on the couch and waited.

I waited for my mom to come home.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. Just sat there, wide-eyed. Dead inside.

And then I heard it‚Äîthe key in the lock.

I waited for the scream.

When it came‚Ä¶ I acted.

I pretended to be confused. Shocked cryied mom questioned me idk am also cry and told mom am just sleep bcoz i have headache

I lied.

Some Neighbours gets there


Mom called ambulance, dad,some family member

And the worst part is‚Ä¶ everyone believed me.

The police never found anything. There was no sign of her. Just a accident death  and  a grieving family.

But I know the truth.

 The police ruled it an accident. No charges. No questions.

But that wasn‚Äôt the end.

Year One:

I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Not even with meds. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her lying there‚Äîstaring at nothing. I started hearing things at night. Footsteps on the stairs. Her favorite song faintly playing even though her phone had been dead for weeks.

I avoided the living room. Couldn‚Äôt sit on the couch. Couldn‚Äôt touch the carpet.

I dropped out of college three months in.

Year Two:

Things got worse. I started seeing her. Not just shadows‚Äîher. In reflections. At the end of hallways. On my bed. Never speaking. Just watching.

I moved out to a rental across town. Told Mom I needed space. But even there, the air felt heavy. Like she followed me.

I‚Äôd wake up to the sound of crying. Same time every night: 11:45 PM. The time she died.

I started talking to myself. Arguing with nothing. I think I scared people. Friends stopped calling. I stopped caring.

Year Three:

I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore.

I haven‚Äôt held a job longer than a few weeks. I barely eat. I‚Äôve memorized the sound of her fall‚Äîit replays in my head on loop. Some nights I wake up gasping for air, convinced I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs dead.

I tried therapy. Didn‚Äôt tell the full truth. Lied to the therapist, just like I lied to everyone else.

Even they said they couldn‚Äôt help if I didn‚Äôt open up.

Now‚Ä¶ I just wander through my days.

I walk past schools and imagine her face in the windows.

I hear her laugh in crowds and turn, hoping‚Äîsomehow‚Äîshe‚Äôs there. Alive. Real.

But she's not.

And every night, just before midnight, I hear her voice in the silence:

‚ÄúAllen‚Ä¶ why did you let me die?‚Äù

I tell myself it was an accident.

But I know better.

I didn‚Äôt push her to kill her.

But I let her die.

And I lied.

Now I live in that lie.

And she never lets me forget it.

After my classes in morning I used to stay at allen for doubts or self study so I went for like evening tea at canteen there I saw her again like she was having her coffee all by herself alone and she finished her coffee I also finished my tea and we both stood there for like 10 minutes I didn't had any guts to talk to her and I could see there that she also I guess wanted to talk to me 

And this ritual went on for like 2 or 3 more weeks we both would go there she would have her coffee and me with my tea and we both would have a eye contact but I guess we both were so shy to break a Convo I would look for that 15 minutes in my whole day but after that she stopped coming to canteen 

After few days from one of my friend who was in her batch told me that their syllabus is completed and she went back to her hometown 

So here I sit after what like 3 months scoring decent enough in jee mains to get a college but still her face comes in my mind once in a while and that void and regret that maybe I would never be able to see her again ",1,1746345674.0,IndianTeenagers,1,1.0,False

But but here's some context first, talking to women has never been my fuerte. I'm like way more comfortable talking to guys than women (idk if it shows but just by calling men ""guys"" and not calling women uh anything ya know... idk if that means anything but anywho), so I've never actually had the confidence to confront a woman and ask her out on a date never did in high school. And also dude, it's not just that, it's literally making female friends as a whole. It's so difficult for me. like I just panic, and avoid them completely and avoid eye contact and all that like it's bad beyond bad. Moving on tho, I'm in my last like couple months inmy college currently, so I actually wanted to ya know make friends with someone that's not a dude for the first time so i just puffed up my chest and just walked up to a girl that was in one of my lectures and started a convo with her. It was kind of easy for me because we just took an insanely difficult exam so.. yeah idk good moment there to start something. It was super short but we kept talking a little bit here and there afterwards which iii like making friends is fucking awesome to me doesnt matter if its a woman or a man, I just like talking to people. The first time I talked to her I was stuttering, and blabbering like a complete dingus but it was funny ya know. She was like actually like super confused and cocking her head sideways a lot, but it was like a 15 min convo the first time so who cares. We kept talking more after that first interaction and i was waaay more comfortable with her and I was panicking less, speaking more coherent sentences (which is a sad accomplishment but hey little victories amirite). Later after that, I was just gonna ask her out on a drink because she's really fun to be around and obviously in my situation I dont have any female friends around to talk to, like none at all. It's always a sausage fest with me and its tiring. So I just wanted to ask her out something small like ""Hey ya wanna go get drink sometime?"" Which is something that I'd imagine being pretty easy for a normal person to ask someone else but not me noooooo, I needed like a whole day before to build up the confidence to ask her thay question, I'm pretty sure I lost like 4 hours of sleep thinking about that one sentence. I get anxious fast ya know um.. yeah i have no backbone. So anyways, yeah we walked out the building we just had our lecture on and I was walking her to the exit and I told her ""oh hey by the way which way are you going to hmm?"" And she was like ""oh yeah im gonna go that way to the left because my husbands waiting to pick me up :)"" and I freaked out totally because I literally was never hit with a situation like that before at TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD I didn't know what to say so I was like ""oh okay cool um see ya."" The thing that sucks too is that i left the convo preemptively i wanted to talk to her about way more things... never got to the coffee thing but that doesn't matter. I just panicked cause I didn't want to idk.. make it weird that I was talking to her even though she has a husband but that's obviously dumb ya know? She's allowed to have male friends, I just obviously jumped to conclusions. Anyways, I'm gonna keep talking to her but no more dates shame shame. I have this bad habit of always thinking about the worst possible scenario with my life. Like for example i was talking to my sis about wearing merch for a band I listen to, but i havent listened to all their records so i dont want to seem like a fake fan and get people mad at me. She told me no one cares if you're a fake fan or not that's made up BS, and i gotta stop escalating things... Anyways that's it... Sorry for my grammar I just wanted to get this out of my chest to any subreddit maaan because I have no literary no karma and its super annoying not being able to post on any of the subreddits I actually want to post on... i wanted to post this on like social anxiety subreddits or something idk. Anyways, take care again!



TLDR: Wanted to ask a girl out on a drink for the first time turns out she was married. Freaked out and ran away cause I'm bad at talking to women.

Also idk if this is the right subreddit to post to oof. Don't make fun of me pleease I'm getting better at this whole socializing thing I swear.

The cravings are there but I feel solid in myself. I believe I can take this fight all the way to the end.

But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the cravings guys.

It‚Äôs that I don't enjoy the things I used to love anymore.

One of my favorite parts of my day to day life has always been my morning ritual. After washing up, I'd brew my coffee, put on my headphones, grab my vape, and get completely lost in music and thought. I‚Äôd move, I‚Äôd dance sometimes for hours. I even bought a full on coffee machine and $300 headphones just for this experience. Guys, it was my space, my place.

But now, it's like the gates to that trance-like place have slammed shut. And the key? Guess.
It's not just this morning ritual, it‚Äôs car rides, it‚Äôs countless other little joys that suddenly feel... empty.

The only thing keeping me going is the hope that this is just the nicotine devil playing tricks on my mind. That it's lying, trying to convince me that without it, things will never feel as good again.
But deep down, I believe it‚Äôs going to get better. That I'll get my morning, car rides and all the little moments back.

I'm holding on, hoping it gets better.

Here‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs worth checking out:

* **It heats and brews coffee with cold water in just 2.5 mins**, or instantly if you use hot water. No separate kettle needed.
* Fully charged, it makes **8 shots of espresso (40ml each)**‚Äîwhich is plenty for a day out or a long drive.
* It‚Äôs super compact‚Äîfits in my car‚Äôs cup holder and doesn‚Äôt take much space in a backpack.
* Works with **Nespresso Original pods** (and similar ALUMINUM ones from Starbucks, Lavazza, etc.).
* Has a simple one-button operation. Even my mom figured it out quickly (she‚Äôs now obsessed because it keeps drinks warm).
* Easy to clean, which is a huge plus for anyone health-conscious or traveling with kids.

**Cons?**  
Only minor gripe: if you don‚Äôt screw the water tank on tight, it might leak a little. Also, it doesn‚Äôt support reusable or plastic pods‚Äîonly aluminum ones. But that hasn‚Äôt been a big issue for me.

üéÅ It honestly makes for a great gift idea too. I‚Äôm already planning to get one for my sister for Christmas.

If anyone‚Äôs looking for a no-fuss, compact espresso maker for the road or campsite, this one‚Äôs a win. Happy to answer questions if you‚Äôre on the fence!

Further, I could have adjusted with the food but the attitude on a busy Sunday of those managing the floors/tables really shows your respect towards the customers.

The floor manager was constantly ogling at our plates to check if the food has finished or not and then suddenly sweeping it away while I am chewing on my last morsel. 

30 seconds later the floor manager comes and ask if I need anything else?! ( i am sipping my coffee maybe? i need sometime to process). I respectfully say yes we are deciding, we have already asked for the menu. Menu appears, we are pushed to order, food arrives and then the ogling begins again! Boss, stop staring at the table and waiting how soon can we finish the food. It felt like there was a virtual stopwatch hovering above my head. 

I left my pancakes half way (which were too eggy to begin with), I am unable to eat my food under pressure. I appreciate the fact that its a busy Sunday, people are waiting outside but you cannot just push the eating customers out with your mannerisms.

1keefeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1keefeg/i_told_everyone_it_was_an_accident_but_every/,"I told everyone it was an accident. But every night, I still hear my sister crying from the living room.","Hi Reddit. I‚Äôve never posted anything before. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm doing this now, or what I‚Äôm hoping for‚Äîmaybe I just can‚Äôt carry it anymore. It‚Äôs been three years, and I haven‚Äôt told a soul. Not a therapist. Not a friend. No one.

But I hear her every night. And I think‚Ä¶ she wants me to talk.

So here it is.

Three years ago, I was 18. My sister Anne was 16. We were home alone for the weekend. Our parents had gone to Bangalore for work‚Äîtypical. They never really paid attention to us anyway. Me and Anne, we fought like most siblings, but that night‚Ä¶ something snapped.

She found something out. Something about me. Something I‚Äôd hidden from our mom. And she told her.

That night, I confronted Anne in the living room. It was late‚Äîstorm outside, thunder shaking the windows. Shadows everywhere. We were screaming at each other.

I don‚Äôt remember the exact words anymore. Just the anger.

I grabbed her arm when she tried to walk away. She pushed me.

I pushed back.

She tripped.

Her head hit the sharp corner of the coffee table.

It made a sound I‚Äôll never forget.

She just‚Ä¶ crumpled. Didn‚Äôt even cry. Just collapsed. Her head was bleeding‚Äîfast. I froze. I dropped to my knees, tried to shake her, call her name.

But she wasn‚Äôt breathing.

That‚Äôs when everything‚Ä¶ shut down. Like my brain split off from my body.


Then I went upstairs. I cleaned the blood. Hid the broken lamp. Sat on the couch and waited.

I waited for my mom to come home.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. Just sat there, wide-eyed. Dead inside.

And then I heard it‚Äîthe key in the lock.

I waited for the scream.

When it came‚Ä¶ I acted.

I pretended to be confused. Shocked cryied mom questioned me idk am also cry and told mom am just sleep bcoz i have headache

I lied.

Some Neighbours gets there


Mom called ambulance, dad,some family member

And the worst part is‚Ä¶ everyone believed me.

The police never found anything. There was no sign of her. Just a accident death  and  a grieving family.

But I know the truth.

 The police ruled it an accident. No charges. No questions.

But that wasn‚Äôt the end.

Year One:

I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Not even with meds. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her lying there‚Äîstaring at nothing. I started hearing things at night. Footsteps on the stairs. Her favorite song faintly playing even though her phone had been dead for weeks.

I avoided the living room. Couldn‚Äôt sit on the couch. Couldn‚Äôt touch the carpet.

I dropped out of college three months in.

Year Two:

Things got worse. I started seeing her. Not just shadows‚Äîher. In reflections. At the end of hallways. On my bed. Never speaking. Just watching.

I moved out to a rental across town. Told Mom I needed space. But even there, the air felt heavy. Like she followed me.

I‚Äôd wake up to the sound of crying. Same time every night: 11:45 PM. The time she died.

I started talking to myself. Arguing with nothing. I think I scared people. Friends stopped calling. I stopped caring.

Year Three:

I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore.

I haven‚Äôt held a job longer than a few weeks. I barely eat. I‚Äôve memorized the sound of her fall‚Äîit replays in my head on loop. Some nights I wake up gasping for air, convinced I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs dead.

I tried therapy. Didn‚Äôt tell the full truth. Lied to the therapist, just like I lied to everyone else.

Even they said they couldn‚Äôt help if I didn‚Äôt open up.

Now‚Ä¶ I just wander through my days.

I walk past schools and imagine her face in the windows.

I hear her laugh in crowds and turn, hoping‚Äîsomehow‚Äîshe‚Äôs there. Alive. Real.

But she's not.

And every night, just before midnight, I hear her voice in the silence:

‚ÄúAllen‚Ä¶ why did you let me die?‚Äù

I tell myself it was an accident.

But I know better.

I didn‚Äôt push her to kill her.

But I let her die.

And I lied.

Now I live in that lie.

And she never lets me forget it.

CHAPTER 1

Something was bothering Zeke lately. A bizarre and surprisingly vivid dream or you could also call it a nightmare, that repeated more and more. What was that nightmare you ask? A book and a door...a strange book with no pages, just the front and the back with a large black splatter in the middle. The moment Zeke opened the book an inaudible voice began calling him from the book. Suddenly a golden eye opened as if piercing Zeke's soul before pooling him in the pitch-black darkness. He stood by a gigantic black double door, wide and tall as the eye could see a dark purple grotesque interlocked arms in the middle down keeping it shut. The moment the dream came to this point a sharp pain struck his mind and soul to the point where he felt he would be torn to pieces, and then he snapped out of it. He let out a deep sigh as his coworker began calling him.

"" hey, Zeke! Why are you standing there like a tree? Pick up the trash already so we can get home.""

"" yea yea, sorry, I dozed off a little""

He picked up a bag of trash from the last house on the list for today, to throw into the garbage truck. Zeke was a simple man in his twenties. he started working as soon as he finished school. The pay was not bad at all, so he didn't complain a lot. He finally managed to buy an apartment to live a quiet and independent life. After work he unlocked the door of his apartment, letting the fresh air hit his nose. he cleaned the apartment yesterday so the smell was quite nice. He leisurely undressed and first got a shower to wash the smell away. He then dropped on the couch to relax and watch TV.

"" hm, I should pay a visit to my parents, we haven't seen in quite a while since I got the apartment. ""

With a smile, he fully relaxed and watched some sports channel, until the TV was watching him. Then he suddenly woke up.

""Man, was I so tired?""

""What time is it?""

As he looked at the digital clock on the coffee table in front of the couch, it blinked at 10:00 at night. As Zeke rubbed his eyes a cold chill went through his whole body with every hair standing up.

""wha....what is that?.....something feels off.""

a The room was darker than usual but the most scary was the silence that fell on the room. Zeke could not even hear his breathing although he was breathing. The feeling came to him of him being watched and as the seconds went by he finally saw ""it"", and his heart sunk to the floor. There in the doorway that led out of the living room, two red glowing eyes materialized watching him and soon after, the body of this being came into view. A grotesque black creature 7 foot tall, staring at Zeke with a mix of hatred and glee. Its mouth opened and a horrifying layered voice echoed through the house.

"" found you ""

Zeke was frozen, he could not think or say anything except sit there in horror and disbelief. ""it"" started to approach him slowly stopping right in front of Zeke's face. As it opened its mouth, stretching it beyond human capacity to eat him whole, something happened.

""???""

The creature was flabbergasted. The living room completely disappeared and it found itself in a black abyss of nothingness surrounding it. Confused it looked around but then suddenly froze as it felt a gaze all around it. It felt the urge to look down and as it did a truly ginormous opening opened below it. Except it wasn't a normal opening but a giant month. As it opened, the creature, to its shock began to dissolve and be sucked in the month.

1keeciu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1keeciu,24 hours in Hamburg pt.2,"Hey everyone, English tourist who asked for advice on here last week. 

I wanted to share with you guys how much I loved spending a day in your city - and how grateful I am for the tips I recieved!

I arrived at Novotel Central and dropped my bags early - like 10am. From there I walked to St. James Church - which is lovely, but I was too early to go in. There is an awesome little cafe across the street called Sugarfree, I highly recommend! The staff were so nice and the food was delicious.

Then I walked past St. Peter's to the Town Hall, which is spectacular, wandered around for a time (grabbed a real nice coffee from Marshall Street Coffee) and headed to St. Nikolai, across a really cute little bridge.

There is an exhibition outside the church atm, it's cool. Very low production values but really great content. I also rode the lift for some awesome views and visited the crypt museum.

Next up, I walked to the Landungsbr√ºcken and bought a fischbr√∂tchen bismarck. Fucking delicious - thanks for the tip. I noticed all the Stuttgart fans, realised there was a game starting soon so thought I would try to watch.

There is a really nice coffee shop on the way to the ground; Playground Coffee. I had the most delicious iced flat white, but the guy serving told me I had no chance of getting tickets for the game. He did, however, recommend going to the WW2 bunker and watching from above. Which I did, meeting a really nice St. Pauli fan and sharing a fanta. Super cool!

Next up, I wanted to see the Martin Luther Statue, and saw the Bismarck statue on the way - a shame the area is closed off but cool seeing him poking through the trees.

Saw Martin, went into the crypt of St. Michael's and was excited to find out that Bach is buried there! I didn't climb the steeple, having done the bunker and St. Nikolai already.

Then I followed some specific advice on here to look at some medieval architecture behind Krameramtsstuben which I loved. Winding little back alley that really makes you imagine what life was like back then.

I walked back home via Deichstra√üe. Again really cool buildings, especially at the back on the river. Finally I followed the Zollkanal back to the hotel, more fantastic architecture! Tired after 30k steps, I had a pretty ok burger from burger heroes delivered to my room. Had to have a hamburger in hamburg.

Thanks so much for the advice earlier and thanks to this city and it's people for being so lovely.

I have a lot on my mind. Im 32F and James, my ex fiance, is 36M. I won't bore anyone with details of how James and I met or how messed up the whole first year of our relationship was. Ill just say he lied about his life, I was unwittingly the other woman at first, then he said she was abusing him so I stayed with him to ""save"" him like an idiot. I moved James into my home in September of 2023 after a year of online. He withheld sex and affection almost immediately, which considering we were a D/s dynamic, it was really hard to deal with. I knew he was poly though so I asked if I could start seeing people in December 23. 

For about six months, I was only allowed to talk to or try to meet up with women. He claimed because he has been poly before, he shouldn't have restrictions, but because I am bi, he couldn't handle me being with another man, and he worried about my safety, I could only see women. I never met any women, they weren't interested in me. I finally broke down and begged him to let me talk to men. He said okay but there were restrictions. He had to meet them first, I had to tell him any plans on hanging out with them, I couldn't date them, and there were certain sex acts I wasn't allowed to do. Anyone who talked shit about him I had to block immediately, but talking shit included pointing out how he was abusing me. I blocked a lot of men. I never met a single one. 

During this time, he reconnected with an old fling, Kat. Before she saw normal pics of me, he had shared our FetLife account with her and she saw a bunch of pretty extreme fetish pictures of me. She shamed me and made fun of me for them and James didn't defend me. I deleted every record of myself from that account and all the pictures from my phone. I covered our mirrors with towels from then on. She eventually stopped talking to him because she clearly wanted all his attention even though she was not in a poly relationship and he wasn't going to break up with me. He then immediately after reconnected with an old ex, Jen, and started pushing threesome fantasies on her. She clearly wasn't interested and just wanted him but he kept turning every sexting session into a threesome scenario and she just went along with it. I told him to stop and he did for a while. Then I saw her ask him which of us two he thought was better for him. He didn't answer her. 

A month and a half ago, James tells me one morning that he met someone on Reddit and was getting coffee with her the next day. This hurts my feelings because of how unequal the poly relationship was so I request I be allowed to meet with men unrestricted. He finally says yes, it's only fair. I start talking to guys finally with the intention of meeting someone. James goes on his coffee date and that kicked off a week of him ignoring me completely to text her. 

The last time we had sex, about a week before we ended, he hadn't spoken to me in hours. I begged for sex. During, however, I got a text message from a man I was speaking to. James angrily asked if I wanted to answer the text right then. I said no, but he was pissed off, so he started going so hard that it made me bleed. We had sex four times in two days and it hurt each time, I bled each time. He gave no after care. The most he did was use my body to prop up his arms to text his new girlfriend. At one point I started crying, so he stood up and screamed ‚Äúwhy are you crying‚Äù in my face. The last time we had sex was anal with no lube but I was so deep into Subdrop I didn't care. He finished, immediately started talking about his new girlfriend, and went to take a shower. 

A week later, he is telling me his plans to meet with the new girlfriend in a hotel for his birthday. I am fine with this. It sucks that I wasn't spending his birthday with him but I didn't want to be clingy. The day before he's meant to go though, I check his iPad and he is texting Jen saying he loves her and wants to run away with her. I confront him that night and he has a breakdown. He tells the new girlfriend and she tries to cancel the hotel meet up. James tries to call her upwards of twenty times and she's not picking up, so he grabs my arm hard enough to bruise, forces me to record myself saying it's okay for him to go, then disappears for two hours to talk on the phone with her. Later than night I have a panic attack because the cheating thing was unresolved so he put me in a headlock. I bite him and when he goes to restrain me again, I threaten to punch him. That's not okay and I deeply regret it. I am so scared of him at this point. 

 He goes to the hotel but doesn't check in with me that he was definitely staying the night (it was up in the air), doesn't tell me if she stayed the night (it was up in the air), and lies and says they didn't have sex. He says he just talked to her the whole night and they fell asleep. I was fine with them having sex so I don't know why he lied about it. 

I check his phone the next day. Not only did they have sex, but she is telling him basically to kick me out of the apartment. I confront him that morning and he does kick me out. Because his girlfriend of two weeks, who has a reddit account and actively talks about how healthy she is in a poly relationship, told him to kick me out. After that a lot of shit went down that I can put in a comment but this is about specifically the poly portion of things. 

I want to be poly. But I think after this, I am going to be monogamous. I've made a fool of myself in public multiple times, I have said hurtful things to him after we ended, so I am not innocent in the unhealthy poly dynamic. I harbor a lot of anger towards the new girlfriend. He ruined the idea of polyamory for me. It sucks.

After 10+ years in the markets (5+ years of actually knowing what Im doing), I built [TradeCraft](https://www.tradingsetup.pro/) to help fellow traders avoid the costly mistakes I made when starting out.   
No sign-up required, completely free to use.

# My Trading Journey

I've been actively trading for over a decade now, but those first 5 years were rough. I have been consistently profitable over the past 6 years. My trading style is swing with tight pivots entries and getting out as soon as things dont work - a combination or Mark Minervini and Dan Zanger. When I started out, I made some classic beginner mistakes:

* Entering trades prematurely without proper setups, no understanding of support and resistance zones
* Ignoring placing proper stop loss 
* Not understanding risk-reward ratios
* Not looking at different time of broader picture before entering trades

Those mistakes cost me significantly. Eventually, I developed a systematic approach to analyzing setups across multiple timeframes with proper risk management. This transformed my trading from consistently losing to consistently profitable.

I've focused heavily on technical analysis, multi-timeframe confirmation, proper position sizing, and risk management. These principles form the foundation of TradeCraft.

# [What TradeCraft Offers You (100% Free Tool)](https://www.tradingsetup.pro/)

I built this tool to provide what I wish I had when starting out:

* Analysis across 3 timeframes (Swing, Positional, Long-term)
* Clear entry zones with specific prices
* Strategic stop loss recommendations
* Multiple price targets with probability assessments
* Position sizing guidance (typically 3% risk max)
* Plain English explanations of technical indicators
* Specific ""What to do"" recommendations for each setup

No catch here. No email required, no credit card needed. I built this because I genuinely want to help other traders succeed, and maybe try to build a business around it and feed my family in the process :)

If you find value in the tool and want to support further development, there's a ""buy me a coffee"" option, but it's completely optional.

# Looking for Feedback

This is the first version, and I'm actively looking to improve it:

* What additional features would make this more valuable?
* Is the analysis clear and actionable?
* What other indicators would you like to see?
* Found any bugs or issues?

Would love any feedback. Feel free to even crap abt it in the comments. You can reach out to me personally on the website through the contact form. Thanks a ton!

Look at me, they seem to shout,

See my shiny, round about!

I‚Äôm important, hear me jingle!

Doesn‚Äôt even dare to speak.

Folders neatly, crisp and grand,

Quiet power in your hand.

Noisy coins, they scream and yell,

Got a story they must tell.

'Bout the coffee they just bought,

Every single little thought!

Paper money, calm and cool,

Doesn‚Äôt act a showing fool.

Worth a lot, but makes no sound,

Humbly staying on the ground.

Think about it, you and me,

Acting loud for all to see?

Posting everything we do,

Like a noisy hullabaloo?

Bragging rights and showing off,

Makes some people just‚Ä¶ scoff.

Like those coins, we make a fuss,

Is that really best for us?

Maybe being quiet, strong,

Is where we truly all belong.

Like the paper, valued deep,

Secrets that the humble keep.

So next time you want to shout,

Turn your inside, inside out,

Remember coins and paper‚Äôs plight,

Maybe quiet is more right!

Let your value silently grow,

Put on less of a grand show.

In response to this, friend A got upset at the fact that friend B flipped out at her (friend A) for cancelling, while expecting us to be okay with her (friend B) cancelling. Friend B didn‚Äôt really see friend A‚Äôs point, and kept reiterating ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault my house is getting renovated‚Äù. 

It seemed like an interesting case of things getting lost in translation. Friend A was upset at the hypocrisy of friend B cancelling plans after she flipped out at friend A for cancelling previously. And friend B wasn‚Äôt seeing friend A‚Äôs pov at all. Friend A blocked friend B, and friend B‚Äôs husband texted friend A having a go at her for blocking friend B.

1kee48d,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1kee48d/philips_baristina_vs_lattego_5400_almost_same/,Philips Baristina vs LatteGo 5400 (almost same price),"Hey everyone,
I could really use your advice because I‚Äôm stuck.

I‚Äôm in Europe and right now there‚Äôs a huge promo going on ‚Äî the Philips LatteGo 5400 (EP5441/50) costs basically the same as the new Philips Baristina. Normally the 5400 is way more expensive, but now it‚Äôs almost the same price. Which makes this even harder.

I know these two machines aren‚Äôt even in the same category (one is more ‚Äúsemi-automatic‚Äù, the other fully automatic), so maybe this comparison doesn‚Äôt even make sense, but here‚Äôs my situation:

I mostly drink espresso, lungo, and iced coffee (espresso over ice + almond milk).

I don‚Äôt really care about milk frothing automatically ‚Äî I can add cold milk myself.

I absolutely hate complicated cleaning routines. I really want something low-maintenance.

I‚Äôm a bit scared about long-term cleaning, especially brew groups that you can‚Äôt fully clean manually.

I‚Äôm planning to use flavored beans (vanilla), but they are dry/matte beans, not oily shiny ones. Still, a small part of me is worried about clogging grinders over time.

I like that the Baristina is smaller, cooler looking and countertop-friendly. Big factor as my wife does not drinki coffee and wife approval raising is higher for nicer Baristina.

On the other hand, the LatteGo 5400 has iced coffee modes, tons of drink options, profiles, and smart rinsing cycles.
I‚Äôm afraid I might miss the convenience later if I go with Baristina.
At the same time, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll buy the 5400 and just end up using it like a basic espresso machine and waste all the extra features.

Basically:
Baristina = faster, simpler, probably better espresso flavor, less cleaning.
LatteGo 5400 = more options, more automation, more future-proof, but bigger and slightly more maintenance.

I‚Äôm completely torn.

If it matters, I drink 2‚Äì3 coffees a day, always using fresh beans. I drink mostly espresso, lungo or iced coffee.

Any real-world owners here? Anything important that‚Äôs not obvious from specs and reviews?

1kee24h,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kee24h/streamlining_life_during_6_week_phd_writing_sprint/,Streamlining life during 6 week PhD writing sprint,"I‚Äôm 39 and trying to finish my PhD dissertation this summer. I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago after experiencing extreme burnout and basically stopping all work. For better or worse, I was able to sort of coast for a pretty long while, rehashing older stuff just before deadlines. But mostly I was totally frozen and blocked by perfectionism. Without the structure and accountability of weekly classes, my working habits especially related to executive function completely atrophied. I‚Äôve had more than enough research done for ages but can‚Äôt complete any one section. I have 100s of pages of sloppy, incomplete chapter drafts that need to be polished. My task avoidance is stronger than ever. Finding page numbers for footnotes I wrote two years ago does not give me dopamine. So they languish for a long time and then when I do work on my drafts I end up just rewriting them to be entirely new and different rather than finalizing the existing material. Novelty is our blessing and curse!!

Somehow I have‚Ä¶six weeks to pull it all together. I have a new therapist who specializes in adhd who I will be working with on the fine grained issues. I‚Äôve always been a high achieving perfectionist/procrastinator, no surprise. But it‚Äôs been a long time since I had to really make something happen like this. I feel so nervous I won‚Äôt be able to pull this off like I used. 

Body doubling, strict pomodoros, face to face human contact, showering at least every other day, journaling/calendaring with stickers for habit tracking, meds, morning pages from the artist‚Äôs way, 3x week 12 step meetings, 3x weekly cardo/hot yoga, high protein intake, declutterred workspaces are essential features that feel non negotiable. 
I need these things to be able to write at all.  But I am also so exhausted just getting through day to day right now. I‚Äôm not sure what I should be doing to make things a little easier on myself for this high stress six week push. 

I‚Äôd love to hear ways that you lighten your load of day-to-day stuff to make room for high stakes/high pressure temporary periods. 
I want to have some protocols and parameters so if things go a bit off the rails that I don‚Äôt let my wellbeing completely fall apart. I don‚Äôt think all-nighters and forgetting to eat and chugging more coffee will work at 39 the way they did at 19. But maybe I can get groceries delivered rather than spending hours at different stores and farmers markets or whatever. 

I should mention:
-I‚Äôm single and very far from family. I have friends nearby but really resist having to ask for help. But also open to using the importance of this moment to break through that hesitation. 
-I‚Äôm pretty broke but am willing to spend more than normal since it‚Äôs an especially important moment and just 6 weeks 
-I‚Äôm vegan who is a great cook. I‚Äôm kind of a food snob and eat very healthy. Would love tips and tricks to getting more practical about repetitive eating so batch meals and meal prep work better for me. 
-I have a roommate who I talked with about how the next few weeks will be for me. I asked her for some grace and patience around cleaning and other things. So I only really have to worry about how much the clutter distracts me. 

How have you avoided decision fatigue? What indulgences or outsourcing actually helped relieve the stress during high intensity work periods? How do I bypass impulsive decision making like skipping exercise when I know the short term pay off of an extra hour of work seems practical but will ruin me for the next day? How much freetime/dopamine generating activities do you allow for when in a heavy work mode? 

ü´®üò¨ü´©ü´£üôèüèº
I know there‚Äôs a lot of high achieving ADHD academic types who go through these kinds of boom and bust cycles. I want it to be a bit smoother than my old cram sessions were during finals. Plus, this is six weeks, not two so I literally cannot sustain it the whole time. 

Help, please?

It honestly felt more like a well-oiled business than a spiritual or religious space.

Parking:
They charged ‚Çπ70 for parking in an open ground. Not a huge amount, but still ‚Äî feels wrong to charge for temple parking. Should be free or nominal.

Security:
Security is super tight. You‚Äôre only allowed to carry your wallet, money, and cards. Everything else ‚Äî including phones ‚Äî goes into a locker. I get the intent, but it felt a bit excessive.

Inside the Campus:
As soon as you enter, you're greeted not by peace but a massive lobby with advertisements for BAPS and their gurus. People are selling guidebooks for ‚Çπ10. Again, not expensive, but why sell this? Why not just have a big, visible map for everyone? I saw only one map across the entire campus.

Fountain Show:
There are huge banners for the light and sound fountain show ‚Äî tickets are ‚Çπ110 per person. Didn‚Äôt attend, but again, it‚Äôs a temple, not an amusement park.

Exhibition Show:
Here‚Äôs the crazy part: My family wanted to see the exhibition (3 shows). Tickets were ‚Çπ260 per person. Fair enough if it's for maintenance. But when I came back after 10‚Äì15 minutes to actually buy them, the price had jumped to ‚Çπ370 per person. Apparently, they hiked prices as the 4 PM crowd started coming in.
Dynamic pricing at a religious place? Seriously?

Premvati Food Court:
We had lunch around 2:30 PM ‚Äî totally different vibe from the Premvati in Gujarat. Overpriced and underwhelming.

500ml water was ‚Çπ20

Tea, coffee, and buttermilk were ‚Çπ60 each

We paid nearly ‚Çπ900 for a basic, meh-tasting meal (no onion/garlic)
Not other food options around either, so you‚Äôre kinda forced to eat there.

Abhishek Ritual:
We wanted to do abhishek of Neelkanth Varni ‚Äî they charged ‚Çπ50 minimum per person. Took 4 glasses of water, and they didn‚Äôt even allow our family to do the ritual together. Felt rude and robotic. Like‚Ä¶ what if a couple wants to do it together?

Gift/Book Shops:
Tried checking out their stores ‚Äî everything was priced absurdly high. From made-in-China t-shirts to ayurvedic medicine to tiny murtis, everything felt like a money grab.

Final Thoughts:
As someone whose family has deep BAPS roots and has grown up seeing Swaminarayan temples, this visit just didn‚Äôt sit right with me. Felt like tourism + business ‚Äî not devotion or spirituality.

If the aim is to spread teachings and values, why price everything like a profit-first brand? Disappointed.",4,1746342988.0,SPAB,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 33M, and my wife (27F) and I are expecting our first child in November. My mother (67 years old, around 158 cm/5‚Äô2‚Äù) came to visit me abroad last Friday‚Äîshe visits once a year‚Äîand I‚Äôve realized just how serious her alcohol use has become.

In the 9 days she‚Äôs been here, she‚Äôs consumed:

- 14 bottles of wine
- 1 bottle of whisky
- 9 half-liter beers

She drinks a glass of water in the morning, a couple coffees during the day, and the rest of her fluid intake is alcohol‚Äîoften just with ice or a splash of water. She doesn‚Äôt *seem* drunk in the typical sense (no stumbling or passing out), but she gets emotionally over-the-top and histrionic during the day. 

She‚Äôs had high alcohol use with ups and downs throughout her life. Her mother (my grandmother) died after a sharp and rapid mental decline related to alcohol (imo), and her brother is also a heavy drinker. I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôs heading the same way. I've always had issues asserting the level of alcoholism she's had because she is highly functional, but I think there is no denying anymore and it is only going to get worse and her health is going to decline heavily. She has had a doctors check up a while ago and she said everything was fine.

My wife and I have decided we won‚Äôt be leaving our baby alone with her. She‚Äôs taken care of my siblings‚Äô toddlers (3 of them in total) and raised three kids herself, but it doesn‚Äôt feel safe or responsible anymore. It‚Äôs a painful decision, but I know it‚Äôs the right one.

After she leaves, I plan to write her a letter. I‚Äôm still processing a lot myself and I know it is going to be very antagonizing for her. I want to be honest, loving, but clear about my concerns and boundaries and I don't know how to do that without hurting or blocking her out of my life. What is clear though, is that my wife and children are my first priority.

I feel sad, confused, guilty, angry, and helpless. I love her, but I‚Äôm starting to accept that I can‚Äôt fix this. Has anyone else been through something similar with a parent? How do you balance love, grief, and boundaries? What helped you cope‚Äîor speak up?

So players of Diablo 4 (Console, PC, smartfridge) have issues with keybinds and that everytime they seem to reset themselves to default. Maybe you also have strange lagspikes wich seem to occure on fixed moments like clockwork. Well, for a few days i was pondering why so this morning after getting coffee i descided to dive into it and noticed some remarkeble things.

Keybinds are saved serverside. Conveni√´nt when logging onto your account from another computer but not so much when you have issues to solve with keybinds.

So i digged a little further and came across several debugfiles in the main directory of the game (usually: ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Diablo IV""). These files are named ""FenrisDebug"" and every so often the filename changes to something like ""\_FenrisDebug-1"", i think that is to keep these files from getting too big. I think this because there are 2 to 3 of these files created per day and they are in between of 1.8MB and 2.3MB. It also might be that every single logon creates this file, seen this today for the first time so i don't know.

But now the interesting part, the debugfile itself because the game logs vast amounts of data (the amount may actually slow down performance since the debuglevel is quite low and it logs alot. In this case it is helpfull.

So opening the file and scrolling down reveals a big problem with keybinds,. For example there are thousands of lines stating this:

And the list goes on and on and on. But look at the time of logging, this all happens in one single minute, many thousands of instances are written. When i log into the game i always have one big lagspike, i think this is the cause of it. The game litterally shits itself here and this happens since the last update. I think that Belial has another weaponskill up in his sleeve where he causes lagspikes so you loose the battle. Haha, just kidding. :P

Sadly this is a problem we cannot solve cli√´ntside since the bindings are serversided.

Oh, and if you players see a lagspike right after going trough a portal, i have seen this in the debugfile:

And this list appears every time when you go trough a portal so it seems and i show just a short list, in reality this lists has hundreds of instances. I can imagine that this is related to what console-players experience, this seems a serverside bug we have to deal with als long as it is not fixed.

Sadly i cannot provide a solution, i only can show what i think the problem is. And with that i think i now know why these lagspikes occure every single time right after opening the game and every time i go trough a portal.

It was actually quite fun to dive into it since i like big debugginglogs. These logs should not have this kind of logginglevel but in this case i am happy to see that Blizzard 'forgot' to change the logginglevel before launch. :)

Maybe in the next couple of days i run the logfiles trough PowerBI or something to see more of the issue but i don't know if that gives new information about this. I also created a topic at the Blizzardforums because a topic on Reddit allone never saved the world from anything. :)",1,1746342600.0,diablo4,0,1.0,False

I've been having some trouble with my Zenetti Induction Moka Pot (3-cup model). Recently bought , it hasn't been brewing coffee properly ‚Äì I noticed that not much coffee comes through, and there seems to be some leakage or pressure loss during brewing, a lot of steam comming out.

I suspected the gasket might be the issue, so I switched back to the older one I had lying around. Surprisingly, it worked better the first time, but when I used the same old gasket again later, the problem came back ‚Äì weak coffee, little output, and poor pressure.

This makes me think the gasket is worn out or doesn't seal well anymore. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt find much information online about the exact gasket size or compatible replacements for Zenetti models. It seems like it might be compatible with Bialetti gaskets for 3-cup Moka pots (around 65 mm outer / 50 mm inner diameter), but I'm not 100% sure.

Has anyone else had similar issues with Zenetti pots, especially the induction ones? Did a standard Bialetti gasket work for you? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

I am accompanying an elderly friend on what will likely be her last big adventure. I am honestly shocked by how much the employees along the way seem to truly hate pilgrims. 

Yesterday when checking into a pre-booked hotel in Portomarin, my elderly friend struggled with understanding the online check in process, and the receptionist started yelling at her. The treatment from then on, through the whole stay was terrible and filled with scorn. And in general, it feels like even at bars, etc, no matter how kind and polite we try to be, the workers seem to treat pilgrims with a general disdain, as though we are inconveniencing them by being there. 

I understand that this is the most touristy part of the Camino. And I know tourists must be frustrating. But it's sad that they are so hated. I guess I just wish I had come expecting this kind of treatment. I had a different expectation in my mind, and of course that's on me. 

Other things I wish I'd known: I speak limited Spanish, but I do speak some. It's definitely not enough. Knowing Spanish is quite necessary. 

Having lots of Euros in small bills is also necessary. I used an ATM at the airport, but most places can't break the 50's I received. Most small bars won't accept credit for only a cup of coffee, and many accept cash only. 

All of this is fine, it just contradicts much of what I read. Again, my fault for having the wrong expectations. But I do hope this is helpful for anyone doing only the very short camino from Sarria. ",6,1746342264.0,CaminoDeSantiago,4,1.0,False

1kedpd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1kedpd9/first_timer_trip_report/,First Timer Trip Report,"We just got back from our first (and probably only) trip to WDW. Here are the stats: 

-Family of four (mom, dad, boys age 9 and 10)
-Caribbean Beach resort, Martinique village
-5 days, April 28-May 2, Monday through Friday
-3 single day passes, 1 night party (HS), 1 free water park day
-Delta airfare round trip from Seattle
-Table service dining plan
-No lightning lanes of any kind
Grand total including souvenirs (rounded to nearest 100): $8,200

First off, for anyone trying to plan a first trip from the west coast, the time difference is absolutely brutal. This is the only reason I won't plan to return, so consider this very carefully for your family.

Weather
The weather was perfect! It was low 80s and clear or slightly cloudy the entire time except one short rain shower on our first evening. Not really as humid as I was lead to expect, but I'm guessing it was the time of year. Overall the heat was nice for me and dad, but the boys found it a bit too hot during the hottest parts of the day.

Resort Property
The Caribbean Beach resort was very pretty and clean with super friendly and helpful staff. The greeter when we first walked in was dressed in a safari outfit and was really helpful guiding us to where we needed to go and walking us out to the bus stop area and explaining how it all worked. The staff throughout our stay was the same, really took the time to guide us. It really took the anxiety out of the trip because the resort is big and WDW is overwhelmingly large, but we never felt totally lost because the staff was so good about directions and explaining things.

The main pool was really fun with the water slides, especially when there weren't a lot of people. The Centertown Market had a good supply of souvenirs and basic needs and the quick service cafeteria was decent. We especially liked the sit down restaurant there at the main building (can't remember the name just now), but it was an 'all you care to enjoy' meal with three courses: salad and rolls, meats and hot sides, then dessert. The adult beverages were very good here as well. My boys favorite thing was the pulled pork, which they are two full servings of by themselves. The dessert was also very good, I think it was some kind of pineapple bread pudding with ice cream and coconut. It came as one huge portion for the whole family to eat, which I thought was really fun and a great presentation.

Martinique Room
Pretty average/boring rooms in the Martinique village. Like a very basic two bed hotel room with no frills (no microwave, no desk, no stationary/pens), but there was a table with two chairs, coffee maker, and mini fridge that got pretty cold. The bathroom setup was kind of weird in that it closed off with sliding barn doors, but they didn't really want to stay closed and tended to wander open. Not a lot of privacy in the room (the toilet area did have its own closing door within the bathroom, though). The beds were comfortable enough and we got pretty good sleep. The on site laundry room was great and the boys loved having a Coke Freestyle right there in the village as well. They made great use of it the entire trip. I really liked the location close to the main pool and the restaurants and it was a very short walk to the Epcot Skyliner as well. It was a bit of a walk to the HS Skyliner, though.

Day 1: Free Water Park Day 
We chose to take a red eye in from Seattle (5.5 hours) at midnight so we could arrive in the morning at 8:30 and take advantage of the free water park day. This turned out to be a bad idea for a couple of reasons: one, I thought we'd sleep on the flight and just need a midday nap, but we didn't and we were deliriously tired when we got to the water park; and two, I didn't know we needed to reserve a cabana 60 days in advance so they were fully booked as were all umbrellas, so my plan to hang out and sleep in a cabana midday until the room was ready was a no go. The place was pretty busy and there were no recliner chairs available under shade and we were only able to find one beach chair to pile all our things on. We were exhausted from the flight and time difference and we didn't really know where to go or what to do and ended up walking all over the place for hours bare feet on concrete. No one had much fun and if I were to do this trip again, I would skip this benefit coming from the west coast.

I had reserved an 8:30 dinner at Topolinos for our first night to kick off the trip with a nice dinner and fireworks show, but everyone was so tired once our room was ready at 4pm, that everyone passed out and slept right through it and we missed our reservation. That was a huge bummer for me, so again, if coming from the west coast, I wouldn't recommend trying to get there early to use the water park day. It's really not that great anyway and definitely wasn't worth starting off the vacation so tired for.

Day 2: Magic Kingdom
Because of the time difference, I wasn't able to get anyone up before 10am (7am Pacific time) and so we got to the park around 11. My younger son has ADHD and anxiety and I wanted to be able to play things by ear so I didn't do any lightning lanes (I wish hadn't needed to schedule any dining reservations either, but that was required). We were able to do Tiana and Pirates of the Caribbean (about an hour wait for each), the tree house play area and a parrot bird show (can't remember what it was called, but no wait!) before our lunch reservation at Skipper Canteen. We didn't care for the food or the drinks here. After this, the boys were still sleep deprived from the day before and wanted a break so we went back to the hotel and they slept until about 5pm. We were back at the park I think before 7pm and did the Little Mermaid ride and the car racing ride. We missed our Be Our Guest reservation which I was pretty bummed about. The end of the night was where I made my biggest mistake: my boys hate loud noises and crowds, so I had planned to be away from the fireworks on the people mover, but they were beside themselves upset that they were missing them as they saw little snippets of them going off from the ride. We ran as fast as we could to a viewing place once the ride was over and caught the last 10 minutes or so, but then we were in the crushing thick of the crowd headed out of park. It was a shoulder to shoulder sea of people and basically my son's worst nightmare and he freaked out. It was a really hard 15 minute slog through people giving us dirty looks and making comments while my son screamed and threw himself on the ground while I tried to get us out of there. The park closed at 10pm during our visit, which was very early to us. Once we got back to the hotel, the boys were wide awake and it was hard for them to get to sleep. I think I finally got them down around midnight (9pm, Pacific time).

Day 3: Resort Day with HS Night Party 
This was by far the best day. Our whole family must have been so exhausted, because we all woke up around 1pm! Good thing it was resort day and we just lounged around the pool and had lunch (really breakfast for us) at the market cafeteria. I was able to do the laundry and explore a bit by myself, which was nice. We had an early dinner at around 5:30 at the sit down restaurant at the resort which was really good and everyone had a great time, then we headed for the HS Skyliner for the night party. We arrived I think just before 8pm and made our way over to the Fantasmic show. We were pretty early and got great seats right down front in the middle. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the show was great! It was my favorite evening show out of the three we saw by far. I really enjoyed the fire and water spray effects and the boys had a great time. After the show, we made our way over to Slinky Dog which was about a ten minute wait. My younger son hated it very much and it nearly ruined the evening. I thought it was going to be a very tame roller coaster for little kids, but it was a bit more intense than I was expecting. I wish I'd done it with my older son by ourselves first to preview it then I would have known he couldn't handle it. Lesson learned. We made our way over to the Star Wars area and this was just incredible to me and dad as kids of the 80s. Walking around this area at night with hardly any people really put you in the scene. We decided to do smugglers run with just me and my older son alone to try it out. It was a walk on during the night party and a bit eerie with no one there walking through the standby queue. My son was a little scared until we saw some other people up ahead finally. The ride was fantastic and my older son was able to convince my younger that he would enjoy the ride, so we all went on it again and finally my younger son had a great time on a ride! He loved it! We then headed over to the other Star Wars ride, which was also a walk on at night (can't remember the name right now, but it's the big ride everyone talks about). This was my favorite ride of our entire visit. The characters of the cast members really sold it for us as well with the way they were dressed and really playing up being guards and us being prisoners. It was great! Everyone loved this ride. Afterwards we made our way over to the last Star Wars ride called Star Tours which was like a moving 3D theater ride aboard a little ship piloted by C3PO. I remember the name of this one because I didn't realize it was a Star Wars ride and I thought it was like a Hollywood stars movie tour lol. That was pretty fun, but nothing special. The night party went until 12:30 and the boys had a great time here and it really suited our time difference. Definitely got our money's worth out of this day.

Day 4: Epcot
I again was not able to get anyone up before 10 and after breakfast, I think we were at the park by noon. I really wanted the boys to do the Remi ride because it's one of the few Disney movies they've actually seen, so we headed over there. Right off the bat, this was a mistake: it was very hot at this time of day and the wait time was at its longest at around an hour. I stupidly had us get in the line anyway and of course my son was having a huge melt down before we were even on the inside part of the line. We enjoyed the ride, but it was tainted by the hard time we had in the line. Afterwards I tried to have us go around to the different worlds, but my youngest was howling at the heat and crowds. I was trying to take long sitting breaks out of the heat in each world, but it wasn't working and we ended up abandoning Epcot by Italy and going back to the hotel. We hung out in the pool and the room until around 6 and then made our way back to Epcot for our dinner reservation in Germany at 7. This was a great dinner and everyone really liked it. Afterwards we made our way over to the big ball and did the Spaceship Earth ride. Afterwards it was just about 9pm so we made our way over to a viewing area for the fireworks. We watched those sitting next to a bronze statue of Walt Disney himself! There was only one other family in the area, so it was pretty nice. My older son said that was his favorite nighttime show. The park closed at 9pm on our visit, which was incredibly early to us (6pm our time). Epcot was probably our biggest fail of the trip since we really didn't get to ride any of rides or see much of the park. Too bad, because of the little we saw of it, it probably would have been mine and dad's favorite park. I was surprised that all the cast members in each land appeared to be from that country and spoke the language. It was really cool. And the smells of each area were wonderful as well. The Skyliner line to get back home was ridiculously long and it took us an hour to get back to the hotel. This hadn't occurred to me and I had told the boys they could take a late swim in the pool when we got back, but we didn't get back until 10:40 so that wasn't possible and they were disappointed.

Day 5: Animal Kingdom and Travel Day
I tried very hard to get everyone up early this day and was again unsuccessful. We didn't get to this park until 11 and the lines were very long by this time. We headed for the Jungle Cruise first because I thought out of everything, they'd really want to see this. The line was well over an hour and my youngest was not having a good time at all. He mildly enjoyed the animals, but I think dad and I enjoyed them more. My oldest liked it okay. Definitely not worth the wait. Afterwards my older son and I headed over to the Everest ride while dad and my youngest went to find a calmer activity. The Everest line was kind of long, but the theming was so cool it didn't feel long. The ride was fantastic! We both loved it even though my son said it was scary. Afterwards we met up with the rest of the family and decided that we would skip our final table service reservation at Yak and Yeti in order to squeeze in one final ride of Navi River Journey before we had to leave for the airport since the line was over an hour. This proved to be a terrible idea since the line was outdoors and hot and the ride was very short and kind of lame. For sure not worth the wait. I wish we would have gone to our lunch reservation instead. After the ride, we left the park at around 4pm and picked up our luggage from bell services and headed to the airport for our 6.5 hour flight home. We landed back in Seattle just after 10pm Pacific Time.

Overall Reflections
We never even came close to using our early entry benefit coming from the west coast. 8:30 is 5:30am to us and we'd have had to be up at around 4am our time to be at the park that early, which is laughable for my night owl type of family. I wouldn't do this visit again with such early closing times, but since I booked this trip back in August, there was really no way to predict what time the parks would be closing during our visit. We just didn't really get our money's worth out of the parks, even though I could tell the value was there. If it hadn't been for the time difference, the parks themselves were awesome and the service was excellent. The cast members being in character are what made it great for me.

The table service dining plan was sort of a bust because we kept missing our reservations (why I wish we didn't have reservations). Otherwise, I really liked having it all prepaid so I didn't have to think about the prices and it kind of 'forced' me to order a fancy drink when I otherwise probably wouldn't have. We left with three adult and one child table service credits unused and probably a bunch of unused snack credits since most of the snacks they wanted weren't part of the dining plan. We had zero issues getting reservations day of so it wasn't any great benefit to have 60 days early access.

Having a child with ADHD wasn't a very good time at the parks. They just aren't really set up for kids like that, even though they did have sensory areas we used and the cast was very kind, it just wasn't working. I mean there's only so much you can do for a kid who can't handle being around heavy crowds, loud noises and heat. I had heard that most people weren't eligible for DAS and so I hadn't even attempted to get it prior to the trip, but by the last day it had been so hard for him, that I did try for it and was denied. If you have a child with difficulties in crowds, I wouldn't recommend going to Disney: they will not have fun and neither will you, so why spend the money on forcing them to do things they're terrified of? Just something to think about if you have a child like mine with an IEP level sensory issue.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of an Italian ice machine involves careful consideration of several technical specifications that directly impact performance and user satisfaction.

**Freezing Capacity:** The freezing capacity is a crucial factor, indicating how much Italian ice the machine can produce within a specific time frame.

Machines with higher freezing capacities are suitable for businesses with high demand or large families. Look for models that specify the output in quarts or gallons per hour. A commercial-grade machine might boast a capacity of 5-10 gallons per hour, while a smaller home-use model might produce 1-2 gallons. It is also important to note if the machine can hold the ice once made, or if you will need additional freezer space.

**Refrigeration System:** The type of refrigeration system significantly influences the machine's efficiency, speed, and energy consumption.

High-efficiency compressors and condensers are vital for rapid freezing and maintaining consistent temperatures. Some machines utilize advanced cooling technologies like forced-air cooling or direct expansion (DX) systems. Consider models with energy-efficient compressors to minimize operational costs. Look for units utilizing modern refrigerants that are both effective and environmentally friendly.

**Material Construction:** The durability and longevity of the machine depend heavily on the materials used in its construction.

Stainless steel is preferred for food contact surfaces and exterior panels due to its resistance to corrosion, ease of cleaning, and hygienic properties. Ensure that the internal components are also made from food-grade materials to prevent contamination. Reinforced plastic or durable polymers may be used for non-critical parts to reduce weight and cost without compromising structural integrity.

**Control Panel and Interface:** A user-friendly control panel simplifies operation and allows for precise adjustments to freezing parameters.

Digital displays, programmable timers, and temperature controls offer greater flexibility and accuracy compared to analog systems. Some advanced models feature touch screen interfaces with pre-programmed settings for different flavors and textures of Italian ice. Ensure that the interface is intuitive and easy to understand, even for novice users.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ease of cleaning and maintenance is essential for maintaining hygiene and extending the machine's lifespan.

Machines with removable parts, such as hoppers, augers, and freezing cylinders, facilitate thorough cleaning. Look for models with self-cleaning cycles or features that minimize the need for manual disassembly. Consider the availability of replacement parts and the manufacturer's support for maintenance and repairs.

**Mobility and Size:** Depending on the intended use and available space, consider the machine's size, weight, and mobility.

Compact countertop models are ideal for home use or small businesses with limited space. Larger floor-standing machines are suitable for high-volume production in commercial settings. Consider models with casters or wheels for easy relocation. Ensure that the machine can fit through doorways and into its intended location.

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality Italian ice machine offers several practical advantages, enhancing both convenience and efficiency.

**Consistent Product Quality:** An Italian ice machine ensures consistent product quality by maintaining precise temperature control and consistent mixing. This is especially critical for businesses aiming to deliver a uniform and satisfying customer experience. Precise control over the freezing process prevents ice crystals from forming and keeps the texture consistent between batches.

**Increased Production Efficiency:** Compared to manual methods or less sophisticated equipment, an Italian ice machine significantly increases production efficiency. This allows businesses to meet high demand during peak hours and minimizes labor costs. Automated processes such as dispensing and batch freezing can reduce production time by up to 50% or more.

**Versatility in Flavor Creation:** Modern Italian ice machines offer versatility in flavor creation, enabling users to experiment with a wide range of ingredients and recipes. This is beneficial for both businesses looking to diversify their menu and home users seeking to create unique and personalized treats. Adjustable settings allow for variations in texture, sweetness, and flavor intensity, catering to diverse preferences.

**Reduced Waste and Cost Savings:** By optimizing the production process and minimizing manual handling, an Italian ice machine helps reduce waste and cost savings. This is especially important for businesses concerned about profitability and sustainability. Precise ingredient measurements and automated processes minimize spills and spoilage, leading to better resource utilization.

**Hygienic Operation:** Italian ice machines are designed with hygiene in mind, featuring easily cleanable components and materials that prevent bacterial growth. This ensures that the product remains safe and free from contamination. Stainless steel construction and removable parts facilitate thorough cleaning and sanitation, meeting stringent food safety standards.

 ## FAQs Section

Answering some of the common consumer questions can help in making a more informed purchase decision.

**What type of water should I use in my Italian ice machine?**
  Using filtered or purified water is highly recommended to ensure the best possible taste and prevent mineral buildup in the machine. Tap water can contain impurities that affect the flavor and performance of the machine over time. Regularly descaling the machine, especially if using tap water, can prolong its lifespan.

**How often should I clean my Italian ice machine?**
  Daily cleaning of the machine's components that come into contact with the Italian ice mixture is essential to maintain hygiene. A more thorough cleaning, including sanitizing the machine, should be performed at least once a week, or more frequently if used heavily. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper cleaning procedures.

**What is the typical lifespan of an Italian ice machine?**
  With proper maintenance and care, a high-quality Italian ice machine can last for 5-10 years, or even longer. Regular cleaning, proper lubrication, and timely replacement of worn parts can significantly extend the machine's lifespan. Commercial machines, designed for heavy use, generally have a longer lifespan than smaller home-use models.

**Can I use my Italian ice machine to make other frozen desserts?**
  While primarily designed for Italian ice, some versatile machines can also be used to make other frozen desserts such as sorbet, granita, or even frozen cocktails. Check the machine's specifications and capabilities to ensure it is suitable for the desired application. Adjusting the recipe and freezing parameters may be necessary to achieve the desired texture and consistency.

Sya yung natanggap, and somewhat totoo naman na may bitter taste akong naramdaman as she always told me na ""ikaw ang mas deserve, napilitan lang ako kasi"". After that, naging chismis sya and nadagdagan pa ng ibang mga kwento which resulted to the point na parang nagkaka-ilangan na kami.

Unfortunately, two months after I resigned, she passed away due to complications from her illness. Since then, some of my former colleagues have been blaming me for her death, implying that I had something to do with it or that the chismis contributed.

It connects you with home-based cafes ‚Äì people opening up their homes as part-time coffee shops.

I'm picturing discovering a hidden balcony caf√© with an amazing view, or a cozy reading nook filled with books and the aroma of fresh coffee. Has anyone used this site before? I'm looking for recommendations! What are your favorite ways to discover hidden gems when you travel (or staycation)?

[500EUR]","I own the Breville Express with the Fellow Opus currently. I‚Äôm not looking at changing the Breville for something different, my wife likes the simplicity of the built-in grinder.

However, I like to experiment with different coffees so I single dose the Fellow Opus. I don‚Äôt mind the grind adjustment (somehow it makes sense to me or I can understand it at least) and I can dial in my beans. Sometimes I find the line between astringent and bitter a little bit too fine so I was wondering whether I would benefit from an upgrade to an Eureka Mignon, either the non-LCD model or the Specialita.

Do the flat burrs make such a difference? Like average amateur coffee enthusiast taste difference. Usually I run specialty beans, medium-light roasts, I‚Äôm not into dark roasts.

As mentioned above I know and experience the issues with the Opus, having to bang it to give up the retention, making a little bit of a mess, I am purely after improvement in taste if there is a noticeable difference.

I am not a professional barista, however I do like coffee, I alternate between espresso, flat whites and V60 (C40) so I don‚Äôt necessarily need a do-it-all grinder, I‚Äôm happy to keep the C40 for pourovers and have a dedicated espresso grinder (as I‚Äôve done with the Opus, purely espresso only).",2,1746339990.0,espresso,8,1.0,False

After the movie, I‚Äôd love to have dinner and coffee somewhere nearby. Just a calm, safe, and SFW kind of night with a stranger who might need the same kind of pause.

I‚Äôve been emotionally committed to someone for a while now, and love has felt extra heavy lately. I‚Äôm honestly a little tired of always being the one who tells the story. So tonight, I‚Äôd like to switch it up, I‚Äôll listen, and you can talk.

We can just sit, share stories (or silences), and maybe make the world feel a little lighter for each other ‚Äî even just for one night.

I‚Äôm probably free by 6 or 7 PM (still checking showtimes ‚Äî also, let‚Äôs be real, ang init pa kasi talaga lumabas). KKB, of course.

1ked5q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1ked5q8/abusive_husband_disrespectful_teens_and_my/,"Abusive husband, disrespectful teens and my addictions","This is just a bit of a vent about my life with the goal of getting a second opinion about it.

When you're born poor, you don't really have much control over your life. My dad asked me to marry a man who is almost 3 decades older than me when i was a teen and I just said yes because I trusted my dad was doing what's right for our family. Yeah, that guy paid my dad a lot of money which gave my siblings a better upbringing so maybe in the end it was all worth it. 

My husband was extremely controlling, abusive and used to constantly cheat on me. I was already a mother of 3 kids(one after another over 5 years) before I even knew whether I want kids or not.

 My children are teens now and I really don't like how they turned out. My husband corrupted their mind and they are racist, sexist, ungrateful and lazy. They would rather spend all day in front of a screen instead of spending time with family or studies. My husband even made sure they think low of me by constantly insulting me in front of them all my life. 

My husband is not that abusive anymore. Aging does that I think. There's just a bit of verbal abuse from time to time. 

I tried to befriend people online hoping someone would understand me and somehow ended up being used for fun. So i can't even trust anyone anymore. 

The only things that make me happy anymore are shopping, drinking coffee and gambling. The thing about gambling is , each successive gamble has to be a bigger one or you don't feel that excitement again. So I've become extremely addicted to it and can spend all day with it. 

Each day is starting to feel the same and I think before I know I'll be old and dead. Do you think I'm living a good life? Or if I should change something about it? I think my life feels empty and I don't know what to do about it. 

What are the things you want to do in life? What motivates you? Love? Money? Success? Family?
