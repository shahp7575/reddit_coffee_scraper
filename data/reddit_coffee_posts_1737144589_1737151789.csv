What's the caffeine content of each of the Huel Black Edition RTD flavors? I saw that ""Iced Latte"" has 95mg when new flavors were launched in the UK, and at least on the UK site the caffeine is called out:   
[https://uk.huel.com/pages/the-huel-black-edition-ready-to-drink-formula-explained](https://uk.huel.com/pages/the-huel-black-edition-ready-to-drink-formula-explained)

But on the US website, there is no mention of caffeine that I can see:   
[https://huel.com/pages/the-huel-black-edition-ready-to-drink-formula-explained](https://huel.com/pages/the-huel-black-edition-ready-to-drink-formula-explained)

Is Iced Coffee in the US the same as Ice Latte? So 95mg of caffeine per bottle? 

And Green Tea Extract is also used in all the other Black Edition RTD flavors... that might be 30 - 60mg of caffeine as well. Are there test results for all those? That would be really useful to post on the website. 

I love the idea of a higher protein product, but some of us really need to be careful about how much caffeine we consume. If all these flavors have caffeine, please take word back that some people can't have that much caffeine.   
  
Please help us!

I, 23 F, have been working at a bar in my area as a waitress for over 3 years. In my 3+ years there I have been hit on many times, I'm blonde and super flirty sometimes for the tips, but I never took anyones number. Once about a year in, I left my number for someone but it didn't pan out and that's when I decided officially no cross mingling. I have also had absolutely awful dating experiences in the past 3 years (Im talking abusive and BAD). Back in July of 2024 I had a total of 3 shifts serving, one Wednesday and two Thursdays in the span of two weeks, I had changed my availability so technically those days I shouldn't have been booked but it hadn't kicked in yet so the days I had booked off just didn't line up and I had to go in (that's what I get for trying to finesse a whole month off lol). On the second shift of the month I served a guy, lets call him A. A came in with two friends of his who work for him and I thought A was super cute (think Miles Teller but with a very kind smile). We chatted a little when his workers/friends stepped outside for smokes, I noticed him more than I normally did of customers, but they ended up just eating and leaving after joking around with me a little.

  


The next week I only worked one shift and I was sooooo close to giving it away but I realized I kind of do need to pay rent so I went in lol. Lo and behold, with me serving on the opposite side of the restaurant as the previous week, A and his friends come in again-and get sat in my section AGAIN. Huge coincidence and I am super happy, chatting and joking with A (kind of ignoring his friends but they didn't seem to care lol), but I have my rule of not co-mingling with customers so after they pay they leave and I pout a little bit missing my Miles Teller looking guy before walking over to clean and reset their table. At my restaurant on the dining side (which is where I am located on this particular day) we have paper and crayons on the table, and right beside where my name is on the table paper I see a name and a number written down. I take three pictures to make sure I save it to my phone before clearing the table. I am a giddy, smiley, sloppy, mess for the rest of the night just debating on if I should message him (in our conversations I learned they live 4 hours away from where I live and were just in town for work and that was their last night in my city), but I am incredibly single so I say F it - lets message him. So when I get home from work I message him, and by the next day we are texting. Over the weekend we chat a fair deal and he is as genuine, funny, and kind as he seemed. He tells me how he has never left a number for a waitress and I tell him how I have never taken a number left for me before so it's both our firsts lol. On the Sunday he says he is in town the following Tuesday for work and asks if I would be up for dinner, I obviously am ECSTATIC but play it cool and say sure (I had by coincidence had that day booked off or else I 100% would have been working).

  


Tuesday we meet at the restaurant and we just immediately mesh together, we talk for hours until he feels bad for how long we had sat at a booth taking up a servers table and we move to the bar to have drinks (he is the most polite to wait staff-huge green flag). After the bar we just keep talking and driving around for hours, kissing a little, but mostly getting to know each other. That weekend I drive up to his town to see him and by the middle of August we are inseparable. He is caring, giving, kind, treats me like a princess, and I know I'm a goner. I admittedly am freaking out because I've never been treated so good so I try and self sabotage by making him talk about serious topics early on to ""make sure we match"" but he is down for the convo and we DO match (jokes on me). So when he asked me to be his girlfriend I had no other choice than to say yes because he is someone who radiates love, happiness, and joy and I would be a fool to let him go. And when we were laying under a blanket of stars at his family's cottage and he told me he loved me, I had no other choice than to say it back-he had given me no choice but to fall in love with him, he's genuinely incredible. He brings me coffee in bed, surprises me with treats, always insists on buying me food, makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world when I have never felt like that before. He holds me when I cry and I know with him I am safe. I hope every day I get to watch him become everything he wants to be because I want to support him for the rest of my life, the way I know he will support me for the rest of mine.

  


So now, every week I drive 4 hours each way to go visit him, and I listen to Two Hot Takes to keep me company every drive. So thank you reddit and thank you Morgan for making my driving for my medium-distance relationship a little less lonely. Though I would drive to him in total silence, or in ear piercing noise-but this podcast does make the drive go by a lot faster.",1,1737151497.0,Positivity,0,1.0,False

1i3rz0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i3rz0m/ghosting_a_childhood_friend/,Ghosting a childhood friend,"I (34F) recently ghosted my childhood friend Amy (34F), and while I feel so relieved, I also feel guilty. 

We’ve known each other since we were preteens, and looking back, I’ve realized that this has been one of the most emotionally draining friendships of my life. She’s always expected everyone to drop everything for her, and if we didn’t, we were labeled “bad” or “fake” friends.

Every guy she’s ever dated has cheated on her or treated her badly in some way. Anytime she cried on my shoulder, I had to be careful not to say anything critical about the guy, or I’d become the enemy. Without fail, he’d dump her, and within a week, she’d have another boyfriend, and the same toxic cycle would start all over again. But talking about it, even sympathetically, was basically a cardinal sin. 
We originally stopped being friends when we were 19 because I just couldn’t handle it anymore. A month later, she married a guy she’d only been dating for two months. Unsurprisingly, the marriage didn’t last.

In 2018,  our old friend group started planning yearly girls’ trips to reconnect. At first, things were civil, and I thought we were rebuilding our friendship. But after her divorce in 2022, Amy went back to being her boy-crazy self. 

She was probably single for five months before hopping on Tinder. Not long after, she told me she was flying out to my state to meet a guy she’d been talking to on the app and would be staying with him for over a week. I asked if she wanted to grab coffee while she was here, but she completely blew me off because she was “spending time getting to know him.” That stung.

Things came to a head during last year’s girls’ trip planning. Amy wanted to go to Florida (again), but the rest of us wanted to go to Vegas. Plus, everyone in our group has busy lives: One friend Lauren, was about to start her final semester of nursing school, another had just started a new job, and I was juggling school and working full-time. Meanwhile, Amy works part-time. It was a miracle that we could all align our schedules for a week off.

When Amy realized we wouldn’t plan the trip around her, she completely bailed and said she didn’t have money or time. However, a week earlier, she was talking about spending thousands of dollars to fly to Florida to go to a Taylor Swift concert. So it wasn’t about money or time; it was the first time no one was bending over backward to accommodate her, and she didn’t take it well.

The final straw came in October when Amy told us she’d been in a car accident and was experiencing severe neck pain. She mentioned how her boyfriend told her not to go to the hospital because her injuries “weren’t serious.” Apparently, he decided this because his back problems were worse, so hers didn’t seem like a big deal. Lauren, and I told her she should prioritize her health and pointed out that her boyfriend wasn’t being supportive. She didn’t take it well. She was cussing and throwing a temper tantrum. Lauren apologized to keep the peace, but I didn’t.

That conversation was a wake-up call for me. It made me realize how little she values her own well-being and how much emotional weight she expects her friends to carry for her. It also made me reflect on how I never really felt like an individual in this friendship. I’ve spent years feeling like Amy’s sidekick—someone who existed to boost her up, cater to her needs, and validate her choices. She never really got to know me as a person outside of being her friend. I don’t think she ever saw me as an individual, just as someone who existed in relation to her.

Looking back, I think this might stem from her being an only child. She’s always expected to be the center of attention in every dynamic, and it seems like she doesn’t know how to engage with others on an equal, reciprocal level. Over the years, I’ve tried to set boundaries and be more vocal about my needs, but it always backfired. Any pushback would lead to her shutting down or playing the victim, and it just reinforced the cycle of me shrinking myself to keep the peace.

I ghosted her, blocked her on everything, and haven’t spoken to her since. It’s been about four months now, and I’ve heard she’s been posting passive-aggressive TikToks about “fake friends.” While I try not to take it personally, it stings. I know explaining myself wouldn’t change anything. It’s not about proving a point or being petty. I’m just done but with that, I can’t completely shake the guilt. I know I made the right decision, but there’s a part of me that wonders if I could’ve handled it differently. Has anyone else been in a friendship like this? How do you deal with the guilt of stepping back, even when you know it’s the healthiest thing for you?

The experience describes primarily Austria, but the same vending machines probably have similar logic.

Here's what I noticed:
1. vending machines with expensive goods (chargers, cables, headphones) and, especially, with a banknote receiver - change is not given and the return does not work.

2. vending machines in specialty stores ""24/7"", especially those with a robotic arm and where the item is picked up from the side instead of the bottom - they don't give change and returns don't work. This knowledge cost me two small bottles of juice at a huge price :)

3. Coffee machines always give change and returns always work.

4. Vending machines at train stations - mostly like the one in the photo, branded 'Selecta'. They are very interesting because travelers throw coins there and there can be interesting finds. Coin receiver - slider, coins are combined (if you throw 50+50 - will return 1 euro, if 20+20+20 - will return 50+10). Throwing should be slow. If too fast, then either the coin will fall out in the return or will not count (put 5, got 4).

5. The second type (also on the photo) - is found in different places and the advantage is that it does not combine coins. Throw in 20 pieces of 50 cents - will return 20 pieces of 50 cents, not 10 pieces of 1 euro.",1,1737150786.0,EuroCoins,1,1.0,False

My boss doesn't know how to make drinks, she only ever cooks or bakes, so I feel that would exempt her from any tip pooling rules that could potentially allow her to take any. I don't know how much she's taking, I plan on looking through the transactions on my next shift and adding up the total to compare to my pay stub. I think it's definitely under half, but even if it's just 10%, I've still lost so much money over the year I've worked here.

I guess I'm wondering if this is a normal thing for small businesses or if my boss is just kinda shady. Or if it's just straight up illegal",1,1737150760.0,AskALawyer,4,1.0,False

1i3rs4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1i3rs4x/my_dad_died_today/,My dad died today,"My dad died today. He was 84 and had prostate cancer for 30 years. I really don’t know how he managed to live so long with it. He always seemed to find the right resources that would help keep it at bay. Two years ago were the first sign of trouble as it began to metastasise and options were running out. Gradually as time went by he started having more regular hospital admissions but that didn’t deter him from continuing to fight it. 

In August last year he walked my younger sister down the aisle on her wedding day whilst battling tremendous pain as by then it spread to his bones. That didn’t stop the smile on his face though. I’ll never forget it. 

He later spent most of October in hospital and eventually was discharged to a nursing home. In my mind this was a shot at some respite care where he’d get some physio and get back on his feet, and eventually go home. He’d always bounced back from everything life threw at him and I was certain this would be no different. It was so hard to accept that by early December he could no longer walk, and then by Christmas was unable to even sit in a wheelchair. He could still communicate but it had become very transactional. How are you? Fine. Can I get you a drink? Yes. We’d always enjoyed one-to-one conversations over coffee, so this was another thing that was so hard to accept. 

He died this morning after my mum visited. He was fast asleep so she kissed him on the forehead and then left shortly after. An hour or so later she got a call to say he had passed. I am so comforted knowing he was at peace at that final moment. No sign of any distress or pain. 

I went through so much anticipatory grief to begin with. A lot of tearful visits, holding his hand and talking to him but all the while I was in a state of limbo. I knew deep down what was coming, and now that it’s happened I get all sorts of waves of emotion. It’s like all that emotion I’ve stored away has finally released. One minute I’m ok and then streaming with tears. I guess I just have to go with it whilst I learn to process a day I thought surely would never come. ",5,1737150738.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 2 and a half years now. And I would say it’s pretty good? I love him to death but he’s confusing me so much. The past year/ year and a half. He’s been nothing but touchy and only compliments my body/looks. He has always hated it when I do anything he wouldn’t do, and he doesn’t want me doing anything bad and he was always stern about “fixing me”? Idk. I thought it was cute at first. But now he won’t text me or anything for like 5+ hours and it’ll be dry, and he just says it feels like a chore, or he’s “busy” I always tell him I’m okay with him having his own life, playing video games or doing whatever. But tell me before hand yk. 

I’ll let him ignore me for hours now so he can feel more “free” ig? But he’s never there when I need him most. And he’ll do things that he knows will make me upset, then I get upset and he gets mad at me for being upset? It’s always so awful over phone, but then in real life it’s like everything is better? But idk if I’m just being manipulated. He only ever compliments my body/face and never ever about my personality or accomplishments. I always ask him if he even likes my personality because sometimes I’ll catch him saying he gets annoyed at me a lot for just being myself. He only ever touches me, even though I don’t really like physical touch. I’m more of an acts of kindness, or quality time of girl yk. But I let him do whatever because it makes him happy. But I feel like he won’t do the same for me. 

He used to be so sweet, and reassured me and actually cared for my feelings. But now I read old messages and can never IMAGINE him saying anything like that again. But with before, he’s told me “if you just ask to do something, and go out I won’t say no” but now I’ll ask to just go out and get coffee, or hang out, or get me flowers, or make me a handmade card. Just SOMETHING And he never ever does. He says he doesn’t see the point because he doesn’t care about that stuff. But anyways, what I’m trying to get at is he has just been going through lengths to ignore me because he sees talking to me as a “chore” and it feels like he prioritizes video games and other things more than me. He even said I’m not his top priority multiple times before. And I’ll bring up an issue and he’ll get mad at me and leave me hanging, even when all I want is reassurance. And he’ll say sorry just to shut me up and then never changes. And so much more. But then in person he loves me so so much. But idk if it’s just because he’s only attracted to my physical assets. He won’t let me break up with him or anything too.

And what confuses me most is about a month ago I offered to go on a break, because he said he thinks he’s just “getting bored of me” and then I said if you enjoy the break, then we’ll actually break up. And he said no, because “he’s afraid he’ll enjoy it.” So I’m confused? Does he love me? Or not? (And sorry for the rant) but it’s odd because like I KNOW he loves me. I’m just so confused.

1i3rrtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiChampions/comments/1i3rrtw/how_i_turned_legacy_leads_into_a_100x_opportunity/,How I Turned Legacy Leads Into a 100x Opportunity With AI,"I wanna share this breakthrough with you.

We recently had a coffee date with a very large life insurance biz.

It went well.

The way I positioned our offer was a little different and I believe this tiny change will make us (and you!)...

10x more money

10x faster.

That’s a 100X improvement.

I am not joking.

Lemme explain how it went down.

Was in the shower about 45 mins before the coffee date.

All my best ideas come in the shower…

…. and the worst lol!

I was thinking about my recent frustrations with a few clients.

They are LOVING us and [what we do](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency).

BUT there’s been times…

When it’s taken longer than I’d like for us to get the commish across the line.

This is because we are working 100 of their old leads per day.

OLD LEADS!

For example over the last 3 days from a recent debt client’s OLD leads:

300 SMS sent

20% response rate

11 appointments set

Probably 3 of these will close = £1200 to us

Now this is not too shabby.

Especially as we only spent around £25 on sms etc.

It is just not moving forward in the way I’d like.

I want to get paid MORE, FASTER.

But how?

What do I know?

Well I KNOW for sure that if we get hold of recent data, the leads convert WAY better.

I KNOW that if we can get their 48 hour data (leads that have already been hit hard by the client’s team for 2 days)...

The Android converts like crazy.

At that point, I KNOW we are DEEPLY embedded in their biz.

They won’t risk losing us when they see those kinda numbers on the board.

So…

WHY am I saying to clients…

“Let’s go after your OLD leads first, and then if you like what you see, we can implement the Android onto your 48 hour data.”

Makes no sense DAN!

Well it does make sense…

If I want to get paid less, slower!!

Why not go after their 48 hour data FIRST.

It will impress the sh!t out of the clients faster.

Meaning, we’ll get paid MORE and FASTER too.

Lightbulb!!

So we made a few tweaks to [our demo SMS](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency) to reflect this simple switch up.

This made sure we were pre-framing the client to hand over his recent data.

Not just his data from 6 months ago.

After our coffee date, the client emailed his biz partner.

He said verbatim:

“….They utilise legacy or non contactable data (24 - 72 hours post generation) to convert.”

Not only was he ready to hand over his 48 hour data to us…

He suggested off his own back, to send non-contacted leads our way after ONLY 24 hours of being generated.

It’s breakthroughs like these that remind me why I have long showers.",1,1737150712.0,AiChampions,0,1.0,False

I just can’t help but feel like I’m the problem and that perhaps I come off as too friendly rather than flirty when I go on dates. I asked my friends for dating advice but unfortunately they are all straight so I feel like their advice doesn’t quite work. An example of a piece of advice I got was “just be more touchy during the date” so I tried that during a recent date where we were sitting on the couch doing a puzzle together. I scooted closer to the girl so we were kinda touching shoulders but then she scooted away and ended up sitting on the floor across the coffee table from me and I was so worried that I came off as a creep rather than flirty 😭😭😭 i felt like we had a really fun and good conversation for the rest of the night and she even gave me a hug at the end but I haven’t heard back from her since that date.

Sarah stared at her laptop screen, the clock showing 9:47 PM. Another late night at the office – or rather, her makeshift desk in the corner of her bedroom. The borders between work and home had long since blurred into a perpetual state of availability. Her phone buzzed with yet another ""urgent"" email, making her wince. 

**She was among the 77% of professionals experiencing burnout at their current job, according to a recent Deloitte survey.**

The irony wasn't lost on her – as a wellness coach, she spent her days teaching others about work-life balance while her own life teetered on the edge of exhaustion. The morning's client session replayed in her mind: ""Remember to set boundaries,"" she had advised, the words now ringing hollow in her own ears.

Down the hall, her neighbor Tom was also awake, the blue light of his computer screen seeping under his door. A software developer at a promising startup, he hadn't taken a proper vacation in two years. The statistics showed he wasn't alone – **55% of Americans don't use all their paid vacation days, and even when they do, 66% report working while on vacation.** Tom had convinced himself that this was just how things were now, especially since his company had shifted to remote work.

The building they lived in was filled with similar stories. On the floor below, Maria, a project manager, juggled virtual meetings across three time zones. She belonged to the 70% of remote workers who regularly worked weekends, responding to ""quick questions"" that somehow always turned into hour-long problems to solve. Her therapist had warned her about chronic stress, but with layoffs looming, she felt she couldn't afford to slow down.

These weren't isolated cases. In their city alone, thousands of professionals were caught in the same cycle. The local coffee shop had adapted its hours to accommodate the growing number of early morning workers seeking refuge from their home offices. The owner, James, noticed how his regulars' orders had evolved from simple lattes to double shots of espresso, as if everyone was trying to caffeinate their way through exhaustion.

A recent study by the American Psychological Association found that 79% of employees had experienced work-related stress in the month before the survey. More telling was that 44% reported physical fatigue, 36% cognitive weariness, and 32% emotional exhaustion – the triple crown of burnout.

Sarah finally closed her laptop, her reflection in the darkened screen showing dark circles under her eyes. Tomorrow, she decided, would be different. She'd start setting the boundaries she preached about in her sessions. But as she set her alarm for 6 AM to prepare for another packed day of back-to-back virtual meetings, she wondered if anything would really change.

The truth was, Sarah, Tom, and Maria were part of a larger story – one where 89% of workers reported their work life was getting worse, and 85% said their well-being had declined, according to a Gallup report. Their building, like countless others across the city, housed the quiet struggle of a workforce trying to keep up with an ever-accelerating pace of life.

Two floors up, Rachel, a marketing director and mother of two young children, was finally finishing up her last video call of the day. Her seven-year-old had interrupted three times during important presentations, and her toddler's tantrum had provided an unplanned soundtrack to a client meeting. According to a recent survey, 66% of working parents were experiencing burnout, with mothers being particularly affected – 42% reported being ""burned out often.""

Rachel belonged to the 59% of parents who said they had no time to relax or unwind after work. Between helping with homework, preparing meals, and catching up on emails she couldn't answer during her children's waking hours, her own bedtime kept getting pushed later and later. Her husband Michael, working remotely for a consulting firm, was equally stretched thin – they were among the 78% of parents who reported significant work-family conflicts since the pandemic changed working patterns.

The kitchen counter told the story of their day: half-drunk coffee cups, hastily scribbled school permission slips, and a laptop with 14 open tabs about everything from project management to quick healthy dinner recipes. A study by McKinsey revealed that working parents were spending an average of 28 hours per week on household responsibilities on top of their full-time jobs – nearly double the pre-pandemic average.

As the city lights flickered outside their windows, each of them carried a piece of a larger truth: the modern workplace had become a marathon with no finish line in sight. And while some called it dedication, others were beginning to recognize it for what it was – a systemic issue that had turned burnout from an occasional occurrence into a chronic condition.

The question wasn't whether change was needed – the statistics and stories made that clear. For parents like Rachel and Michael, the stakes were even higher – they weren't just managing their own burnout but trying to model healthy work-life boundaries for the next generation. A recent study found that 67% of children could recognize when their parents were stressed from work, creating a concerning cycle of anxiety that rippled through families.

The question now was whether we would recognize the weight we were all carrying – parents and non-parents alike – before it became too heavy to bear. Because somewhere between the late-night emails and missed bedtime stories, we'd normalized a way of working that wasn't just unsustainable for individuals, but for entire families.",1,1737149717.0,ManInProgress,0,1.0,False

1i3rd4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shakepay/comments/1i3rd4h/some_extra_info_about_recent_account_closures/,Some extra info about recent account closures,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to provide some extra context on some account closure posts that you may have been seeing on our subreddit. While I can’t get into specifics, it’s a good opportunity to clarify some things and try to put some of your concerns to rest.

Shakepay is a big believer that [regulation is incredibly important](https://betakit.com/shakepay-bolsters-regulatory-standing-with-ciro-membership/) when it comes to giving Canadians safe and trustworthy platforms to interact with crypto. We recently [announced our CIRO membership](https://blog.shakepay.com/regulated-ciro/) which brings with it $1 million in CAD insurance per account and better transparency surrounding spread (among other things). 

Shakepay is also certified by Canada’s anti-money laundering agency, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), as a money service business (MSB) and registered as an investment dealer with the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in Québec and the securities regulatory authorities in all provinces and territories.

**What might get an account closed?**

Shakepay must comply with requirements and rules mandated by its regulators, banking providers, partners and other processors. Because of this, we’re held to extremely high standards. [Section 7 of our Customer Account Agreement](https://legal.shakepay.com/master) does a good job of outlining prohibited activity and I would encourage you to give it a quick read. It includes things like:

* **Illegal activity** \- examples include paying for, supporting or otherwise engaging, directly or indirectly, in any illegal gambling activities, fraud, money-laundering, terrorist activities or other illegal activities, or using your Account in connection with a person for whom it is prohibited by law to do so.
* **Abusive activity** \- activity that would inhibit other customer’s experience or or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of our Services in any manner.

In some cases, accounts can be closed with little to no notice, should we determine that activity occurring on it is prohibited. When we close an account due to risk tolerance, customers are always asked to withdraw funds back to their personal bank account. We’ll proceed with closing the account only once this step has been completed.

**What won’t result in account closure**?

Regular account activity will not lead to account closure. You can fund your account, send money to your friends, store BTC in your cold wallet, use your Shakepay Card to your heart’s content and much more! We want you to take advantage of all of the products and services that we offer and accounts won’t be closed if you’re simply living your life. 

Sure, you maybe didn’t need to split your group coffee order into 3 payments (#ShakeSquad) but this is not going to result in an account ban. With that being said, time for the next frequently asked question in threads where account closures are discussed.

**Can accounts be closed due to rewards abuse?**

The short answer is yes, but you should never be caught off guard by this outcome. If we see abusive behavior being used with our rewards programs, our very first course of action is always to **reach out to the individual and ask that they refrain from this sort of behavior**. We may escalate these cases to the point of account closure if the activity continues. 

If you’re worried about your multiple card transactions per day or week, please don’t be! Legitimate card use simply will not get flagged, even if you’re a Shakepay Card power-user. But if you’re making dozens, hundreds, or thousands of purchases per day, especially with a very small value, that might warrant a message.

**TL;DR**

If you’re using your account as normal, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. I hope this helps alleviate some concern. Please let me know if you have additional questions and I’ll do my best to answer.

These are the solidly middle class kids. The wealthier families are a few blocks away at private school. I see them after school in places like Lululemon and Sephora buying clothes and perfumes.

Moms just look at me and shrug and say at least they don't smell gross like teenage boys used to!

Let’s talk about something crucial: **how to avoid getting hacked.** Many of us unknowingly make simple mistakes online that put our security at risk. Here are 6 things you should stop doing immediately to keep your data safe:

# 1. Reusing Passwords Across Multiple Accounts

Using the same password for different platforms is like using one key for all your doors—if it gets stolen, everything’s compromised. Always use unique passwords and consider a password manager to keep track of them.

# 2. Skipping Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

A password alone is no longer enough. Enabling 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or confirmation from your device. Activate it for important accounts like your email and bank.

# 3. Clicking on Suspicious Links

Phishing attacks often start with a single, innocent-looking link. If you don’t trust the source, don’t click it! Hover over the link to check where it leads before taking action.

# 4. Ignoring Software Updates

Those pesky update notifications? Don’t ignore them! Updates often fix security vulnerabilities. Make sure your operating system, apps, and antivirus software are always up to date.

# 5. Connecting to Public Wi-Fi Without Protection

Free Wi-Fi at your favorite coffee shop might seem convenient, but it’s a hacker’s playground. Use a VPN to encrypt your connection and keep your data safe.

# 6. Failing to Back Up Your Data

Ransomware attacks can lock you out of your files permanently. Regularly back up important data to an external drive or secure cloud storage to avoid losing it all.

1i3r7go,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1i3r7go/low_contact_or_no_contact/,Low Contact or No Contact?,"Postpartum & I need to vent a bit….

I posted a few months ago about overbearing behaviors and things my MIL started doing once I got pregnant. For some background, DH has always been in low contact with his mother in the 6 years we’ve been together. They have had a strained relationship since he was a small child. We live a few hours away from DH’s family/MIL and usually will only see them every couple months. Before I got pregnant DH would \*maybe\* talk to his mother once a month beyond a few texts to our group chat. Once I got pregnant she started attempting to interject herself into DH and I’s life even more than before.

To list a few examples: She sent me caffeine free teas because “it would be a good change for me to not have any caffeine/coffee while pregnant.” She brought up circumcision to DH and I multiple times when we were visiting them. She has also made it clear what she wants/thinks is best and approves of without us asking like she's a baby expert. She also said she wanted to buy her own wrap to wear my baby and I just looked at her lost for words. MIL had also asked multiple times to come to appointments, ultrasounds, and to be in the delivery room. When all three requests were denied, multiple times, she then asked to be at the hospital when we were. “Not to be in the delivery room, but so they can peek in through the window at us and the baby while we have him!” I responded saying we will let people know when they can come visit us. Nobody was at the hospital when I was having him or was notified we were even there until we felt comfortable. 

Fast forward to baby being here, I am still recovering and we are trying to get into a routine. MIL now asks for photos and information daily instead of giving us space to want to share with her. If she messages our group chat and neither of us respond she will send additional texts or random question marks. It is getting ridiculous and demanding. When DH does not answer her calls or video calls she will call him over and over some days. It’s to the point where DH let his phone die for multiple days. He ended up picking up a call from her after a week of not saying anything and she shouted at him saying he has to answer as if she is an authority over him or a coparent. DH hung up on her. She and FIL came to visit us when the baby was about a week old, and when we went to say goodbye I was standing holding my baby to give hugs by the front door. MIL ducks down and kisses my baby's feet and says, “he can’t reach those yet, so I am fine to kiss them!” I was so tired and it happened so fast I had no time to react at the moment. I just wanted them out of my house. Had I not been totally drained I would have pushed her away and told her off. DH and I have made it very clear to the few people we have had visit that no one is to kiss the baby ANYWHERE. 

Now MIL is wanting us to travel for a family gathering with our newborn. DH will be working, which was the only reason she thought would prevent us from going. Not the fact that I am still healing, that we have a new baby, or that we just don’t want to go. I haven’t even had my postpartum follow up with my OB yet. I just really needed to write this out, at this point ignoring MIL’s messages and requests is doing nothing. I do feel bad for ignoring her, but she has no respect for DH or myself and thinks of our baby as hers. She even asks how “our baby” or “her baby” is. She is so enmeshed with the rest of DH’s family that I don’t know if going no contact is an option. I really just cannot get over the audacity of this woman. I am cordial with her in person and I have tried several times to have a relationship with her but something weird or manipulative always happens causing DH and I to step away. We both want our child to have good relationships with grandparents. At this point, I do not know if there is a way to have a somewhat normal relationship, even with set boundaries.

Lock in again ahead of the weekend for some more google ads sauce. In my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/1hyp28j/5_things_i_wish_i_knew_about_google_ads_before_i/), I touched on the importance of good ad copy which prompted a lot of DM's asking me what exactly that meant. For those that are more advanced, this will be cakewalk, but I do hope this can serve as a useful guide to those that are new or are considering using google ads for their business. So without further ado, here goes:

**Lesson 1: Emotion + Facts: The Winning Combo**

* To create ad copy that truly converts, you need to speak to both the heart and the mind.  All decisions, whether we like it or not, are largely emotional, with logic serving as post-action justification. The best-performing ads tap into this, combining emotional appeal with factual proof to compel action - emotions drive clicks and facts build trust (and in turn conversions). Great ad copy blends both of them together seamlessly.
* **Example:**
   * Emotional Hook: *“Tired Of Feeling Stuck In Your Career?”*
   * Factual Proof: *“95% Of Our 20,000 Graduates Landed A High-Paying Job In Tech Within 6 Months.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Adjust the emotional & factual balance by your product / service niche and audience type. Low cost commodity physical products will require different language & tonality to say an enterprise software company for example. Find the emotional and factual balance that converts best for your audience, and scale those campaigns accordingly.

**Lesson 2: Specificity Will Always Beat Generalization**

* Now that we’ve covered the importance of emotion and facts, let’s talk about another crucial element - specificity. Generic half-hearted ad copy doesn’t just not stand out, it actively reduces trust. People respond to offers that make them feel heard. Being specific helps your ad answer the user’s subconscious question: *“Why does this ad deserve a click?”.* After all, you're also competing against a sea of often higher ranked organic results.
* **Example**
   * Generic: *“Reduce Joint Pain Using Our Proprietary Formula”*
   * Specific: *“Relieve Joint Pain By More Than 50% In Just 14 days - Clinically Proven And Trusted By 25,000+ Arthritis Sufferers Worldwide.""*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * Always include numbers to describe time saved, results achieved, or improvements made. Use data from real customer results and case studies to provide this type of specificity. Test out anchoring your offer to industry comparisons. By positioning your product against competitors you addresses the user’s implicit question: *“Why should I choose you over others?”*

**Lesson 3: The Importance of Contextual Relevance**

* Great ad copy isn’t just about what you say, it’s about saying it at the right place & time. Contextual relevance ensures your message resonates with the user’s immediate situation, such as their location, device or even time of day. When ads feel personalized to the moment, they drive higher engagement and conversions.
* **Example**
   * Not Contextually Relevant: *“Fast Online Coffee Order”*
   * Contextually Relevant: *“Hot Coffee Delivered To Your Office In Under 20 Minutes - Perfect For Your Afternoon Break.”*
* **Pro Tip:**
   * This is quite offer dependant but using geo-targeting and separating out your campaigns to make your ad feel local will always provide better results than not doing so. Tailor your messaging to align with user behaviour throughout the day and thoughtfully account for how mobile users interact with your ads differently than desktop users.

  
Now, all of this is well and good but it can only take you so far without a proper landing page that knows how to convert users. But I'll leave out that rabbit hole for another time... As always, if you have a question that you don't want to share publicly, DM's are open.

I’m happy to say that I’ve got it up and running and done my first couple of roasts and would say that overall I’m 90% happy with where it’s at right now.

My roast profiles from the Smola roaster just don’t behave the same on this roaster doing 3x the batch size. I’ve only done 2 600g roasts so far and they have been good but not great. I will say it’s already better coffee than the first 20 batches I ever did on the Smola so I can’t complain. I intend to move up in batch sizes until I figure out where it’ll max but I’m afraid it won’t do 1kg like I was really hoping for. At least not with the current heating element. 

This is not the final design of it, right now to get the beans in and out I have to disassemble the sight glass from the lower funnel and then scoop them out. I fully intend on figuring out a way to keep it as is and “suck” the beans from the top and out, or rework the bottom with a tee and a couple valves to drop out the bottom similar to Java Master. Either way I go, I want it to be butterfly valves that I can turn to route the beans out. 

The top will eventually have a tee with the exhaust going out sideways while beans can be dropped in from the top.

Since a couple had asked before, the “vent” on top of the 5 gallon chaff collector is just a carbon filter used for greenhouses. It makes this virtually smoke free and can roast multiple batches in the garage with very very minimal noticeable haze in the air.",1,1737148713.0,u_No-Strawberry6797,0,1.0,False

1i3qqk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i3qqk8/fn_the_weight_of_the_day/,[FN] The Weight of the Day,"The alarm clock blared with cruel precision, and Andrew Ironclaw groaned, slapping at it until it silenced. He swung his legs out of bed, rubbing the sleep from his amber eyes. The smell of coffee wafted up the stairs, and for a brief moment, he felt a pang in his chest. He was taken back to when his mom used to make breakfast for him and his two brothers before school. Now it’s just him, his father and his younger brother, Jasper. Caleb was living in Seattle now for school, and mom has been gone for a long time. 

Dressing quickly in his Veronaville High sweatshirt and jeans, Andrew grabbed his backpack and bounded downstairs.

“Morning,” he mumbled, grabbing an apple from the counter.

His father, Titus, barely glanced up from the morning paper, his salt-and-pepper beard twitching as he grunted in response. “Football practice tonight?”

“Yeah, right after school,” Andrew replied.

“Then be home by eight. We’ve got work to do.”

Andrew sighed but didn’t argue. He knew exactly what “work” needed to be done. Andrew and his family were werewolves. His pack has been living in the town of Veronaville for generations, protecting each other from humans as well as their mortal enemies, vampires. As the pack Alpha, Titus took his duty seriously. Maybe a little too seriously, and he expected Andrew to fall in line with him every step of the way. But Andrew respected his father, even though the weight of responsibility felt suffocating.

Stepping out into the cool morning air, Andrew hopped on his bike and pedaled toward the Veronaville Diner.



The diner was already buzzing with early morning regulars when Andrew walked in. The smell of bacon and coffee hit him like a warm blanket, momentarily easing the tension in his shoulders.

“Morning, Reggie,” Andrew called as he slid into a stool at the counter.

Reggie Finch, the diner’s enigmatic owner, glanced up from the coffee pot. “Morning, Andrew. You’re looking like someone carrying the world on his shoulders again. Coffee or cocoa?”

Andrew smirked. “Cocoa, thanks. I’ve got enough energy for now.”

Reggie nodded and slid a steaming mug toward him, along with a plate of scrambled eggs and toast. “Big day?”

Andrew shrugged. “Same as always. School, practice, then… family stuff.”

Reggie’s eyes gleamed with an unreadable expression. “Ah, family stuff. Funny how that can mean so many things to so many people.”

Andrew didn’t have time to decipher Reggie’s cryptic words as the clock above the counter reminded him he was running late. He wolfed down his breakfast, left some cash, and bolted out the door.



Andrew pedaled hard, barely managing to lock up his bike and dart into the building before the first bell rang. He slipped into his seat in history class just as the teacher, Mr. Hardy began his lecture on European conflicts.

“Nice of you to join us, Mr. Ironclaw,” Hardy said, his sharp eyes briefly meeting Andrew’s.

“Sorry,” Andrew muttered, sinking into his seat.

Mr. Hardy continued, his voice a steady drone as he wrote key points on the board. But Andrew struggled to focus. His mind drifted to the responsibilities waiting for him at home and the aching muscles from last night’s drills. He tapped his pen against his notebook, staring at the words without processing them.

“Andrew,” Mr. Hardy’s voice cut through his thoughts. “Perhaps you can enlighten us about the significance of the Treaty of Westphalia?”

Andrew blinked, his heart sinking as the rest of the class turned to look at him. “Uh… something about ending a war?”

A few students snickered, and Mr. Hardy sighed. “It ended the Thirty Years’ War and established the concept of state sovereignty. Pay attention.”

Andrew nodded, his cheeks burning as he ducked his head, pretending to take notes.



Lunch couldn’t come sooner but as Andrew made his way to the cafeteria, he was stopped by his science teacher, Ms. Wheeler.

“Andrew,” she called, stepping out of her classroom. “Got a minute?”

He sighed internally but forced a polite smile. “Sure, Ms. Wheeler. What’s up?”

“You missed last week’s lab report,” she said, holding a folder. “I need you to go over these corrections and resubmit it by tomorrow.”

Andrew nodded, taking the folder. “Sorry about that. I’ve just been… busy.”

“I understand,” Ms. Wheeler said, her tone softer. “But you’re capable of more than this. Don’t sell yourself short.”

“Thanks,” he muttered, clutching the folder like it was a lead weight.



By the time he made it to the cafeteria, lunch was well underway. He spotted Zane Cross and Elias Stormhowl at their usual table and made his way over, tray in hand.

“Late again?” Zane teased, balancing a French fry on the edge of his tray.

“Had to talk to Ms. Wheeler about some stupid lab report,” Andrew replied, dropping his tray down and stealing the fry.

“Classic Andrew,” Elias said, his mop of dark blond hair falling into his eyes as he grinned. “You can’t seem to stay on top of things lately, can you?”

He wasn’t wrong. With his father’s near nightly assignments and the growing amount of assignments, Andrew felt like he was being crushed. Was this what his life would be from now on? Constantly having to deal with situations with no rest? Is this why his dad was such an asshole?

As Zane and Elias turned to another heated debate on who was the best quarterback in the NFL, Andrew began to gaze across the cafeteria hall, a habit now thanks to his father when he noticed the school’s resident rich boy, Theo Ravencroft. Theo was sitting a few tables away, quietly reading. Despite being rich, Theo was not really popular. Really the only person he has even seen Theo hang out with is the other rich student, Marissa Vancea. Without realizing it, Andrew began to stare at Theo. His tall and slender frame with pale skin, neat and perfectly styled black hair, and piercing violet eyes seemed to mesmerize Andrew.  

Suddenly Theo looked up from his book and their eyes briefly met before Theo looked away, his face impassive. Andrew frowned but quickly focused back on his friends. It was best if he kept his distance from Theo anyways. They're mortal enemies and Andrew knew that one day they could be at each other’s throats, new fighters for the ongoing Vampire-Werewolf War.

“What’re you staring at?” Zane asked.

“Nothing,” Andrew muttered, focusing on his food.

  
Football practice was grueling as always. Coach Barkley ran them through endless drills, emphasizing teamwork and precision. Andrew was a linebacker, and the constant tackles and blocking left him sore and bruised.

“Great hustle, Ironclaw!” Coach barked after Andrew stopped a running back mid-sprint.

Despite the praise, Andrew’s mind wandered as the sun dipped lower in the sky. He could feel the pull of the moon, a subtle hum in his veins reminding him of the other world he lived in.



By the time he got home, Andrew’s father was already waiting on the porch, arms crossed.

“You’re late,” Titus said, his voice stern.

“Coach kept us longer,” Andrew replied, parking his bike and trudging up the steps.

Titus handed him a flashlight and a backpack. “No excuses. Let’s go.”

They trekked deep into the woods, the cool night air biting against Andrew’s skin. Titus explained the assignment as they walked—a territorial inspection to make sure no rogue wolves or other creatures had encroached on their land.

“Andrew, pay attention,” Titus snapped as his son tripped over a root.

“Sorry,” Andrew muttered, straightening.

They came to a clearing where claw marks marred the trees, and Titus knelt to examine the ground. “Fresh scent,” he muttered.

Andrew knelt beside him, his heightened senses catching the faint musk of another wolf.

“Solo traveler,” Titus concluded. “But we can’t take chances. Mark the trees.”

Andrew shifted his stance, focusing on his claws as they extended. He marked the trees while Titus set up scent barriers.

“Do you ever think…” Andrew started, hesitating. “I mean, do you ever wonder what it would be like to just… not have to do these things every night? That Maybe we can live in peace?”

Titus straightened, his amber eyes sharp. “This is who we are, Andrew, the world we live in. You can’t run from it.”

Andrew didn’t reply, the weight of his father’s words settling heavily in his chest.



Later that night, Andrew collapsed into bed, every muscle in his body aching. He stared at the ceiling, his mind racing with thoughts of the day—the judgmental gaze of his teachers, the fleeting glance from Theo, the heavy expectations from his father.

As his eyelids grew heavy, he sighed. Tomorrow would be another long day. But for now, he let himself drift into a dreamless sleep.",1,1737147951.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I always liked strong coffee and used a Bialetti to make my coffee and for that I was using reground coffee. Now with my Espresso machine (Dedica) I am using fresh beans from a local roaster and a very cheap electrical burr grinder from Tchibo (German Coffee Brand). The grinder actually grinds fine enough for espresso, I have one or two clicks left deepening on the coffee I use before the machine completly stalls and no coffee comes out. But the thing is that I keep reading about people describing their Espresso as tasting fruity and all kinds of exotic flavors. When I am doing espresso it just always kinda tastes the same. When I use light roasted beans the espresso is just extremely sour but not really fruity in flavor. Now my question is if this acidity (if light roast beans) or this muddyness (if darker roasted) is coming from the grinder. I would really like to have some more fruity stuff without it being completly sour.

@ City Diner  
Falls Church, VA  
  
One of the few places in the area where we can get Fried Catfish for breakfast is at the City Diner in Falls Church, VA.  
  
Their extensive menu has pages of diner staples, but today, both my wife and I were craving the catfish and eggs platter which also came with grits (or home fries).  
  
A good cup of coffee started the meal right! My wife liked the strong brew. I just sank into the perfectly warm cup.  
  
I was looking for something different so I also ordered some Strawberry Blintzes to go with my Catfish breakfast.  
  
The waitstaff were quick with the coffee refils and the the food also came out in short order.  
  
The catfish fillets were nicely breaded and fried crisp. Grits were cooked well to a creamy texture. Eggs were made perfectly to order as well, with a rich oozy yolk for dipping the corners of my toast..  
  
The blintzes were good, and served with sour cream, fresh strawberries and a strawberry compote. 

The sour cream was whipped up a bit, so I mistook it for whipped cream.  It took a few tastes before I realized it was sour cream. This was a good meal for doing some heavy weekend work.  
  
We love the City Diner, but wish it went back to the pre-covid hours where we could come for a late night meal. Now, you have to get there before 7PM on most days.

1i3qfne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1i3qfne/talking_to_women_advice_say_anything/,Talking to Women Advice - Say Anything!,"I (26M) see a lot of posts from people confused about how to approach women or unsure of what to say. Some suggest simply walking up to a woman, telling her she’s beautiful, and asking for her number. While this method isn’t necessarily wrong, it’s a HUGE ask for someone not used to being upfront, and it’s not always the most effective approach.

In today’s world, dating apps dominate, and in-person approaches have become a novelty—which can actually work to your advantage if done right. As someone who has learned through trial and error, here’s what I’ve found to work well. Plus, the women in my life agree that this method is respectful and approachable.

**The Key: Say Something—Anything**

If you see someone you find attractive or think is your type, just start a conversation. It doesn’t need to be perfect or rehearsed—just genuine. **Pick-up lines don’t work.** They often come across as cheesy or insincere. Instead, focus on being authentic and starting a real conversation.

If by the end of that conversation you feel there’s potential, *then* ask for their number. Here’s the difference between this approach and immediately asking for their number: Starting with a conversation shows genuine interest and gives you a chance to see if they’re interested too. It’s much easier (and less awkward) than opening with, “Hey, you’re super pretty—can I get your number?”

**Examples of Openers That Worked for Me**

Here are real-life examples of how I’ve started conversations, gotten to know someone, and later asked for their number:

    •**Dog park**: “What breed is your dog?”
    
    •**On the train**: “That’s a cool backpack—where did you get it?”
    
    •**Coffee shop**: “Sweet shoes! Do you think I could pull these off?”
    
    •**Trader Joe’s (in the jam aisle)**: “Any jam here you’d recommend?”
    
    •**On a plane**: “Oh, are you from St. Louis (our destination)?”
    
    •**Trivia night at a bar**: “These questions are killing me. How’s your team doing?”
    
    •**At a bar with friends**: “Hey, do you know what time this place closes? Or if there are any other cool bars nearby?”(For context: I’m maybe slightly above-average looking, but not someone women typically fawn over.)

The point is to just start talking. Nothing is flashy, just genuine sincere conversation. Saying *something* is far better than staying silent.

**Gauge Their Interest**

Once the conversation starts, pay attention to their body language and responses:

    •Are they maintaining eye contact or smiling?
    
    •Do they sound engaged or enthusiastic?
    
    •Most importantly: Are they keeping the conversation going or asking questions back?

Follow up naturally. For example, if you ask about good food in the area, you can ask if they live nearby, which naturally leads to more conversation.

**Start Small and Redefine Success**

Set a reasonable goal: Just start a conversation with someone you find attractive. That’s it! You don’t have to immediately ask for their number. The real victory is in taking the initiative and doing something hard—starting a conversation.

Here’s an important mindset shift: **No salesperson closes 100% of the time.** Rejection is part of the game in life. As much as it sucks, getting better at handling it makes you stronger. Every rejection teaches a lesson, helping you improve for next time.

Don’t define success as “getting their number.” Instead, define it as having the courage to put yourself out there. The more you practice, the easier it becomes to start these conversations and eventually ask people out.

**Rejection Isn’t a Failure**

If the conversation goes well but they’re not interested or decline to share their number, don’t feel dejected. Look at it this way:

     did something difficult, and that’s a win.
    
    2.If done respectfully, most women see this as a compliment.
    
    3.You’re building confidence and experience for future interactions.1.You

In my experience, I’d much rather ask for a number and be rejected than never ask at all. Putting yourself out there means you won’t be left wondering “What if?” You’ll know where you stand and can move on confidently.

Dating and meeting people isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. Start with small steps, focus on genuine interactions, and celebrate the effort you’re putting in. I hope this advice helps, and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have.",42,1737147136.0,AskMenAdvice,74,0.89,False

A brief backstory about our relationship and her recent start on medication, we started talking beginning of September last year and have been officially dating since December. At the beginning of November, she began taking medication to treat her panic attacks, which she had frequently. Throughout our relationship, it is difficult to hang out with her because she is busy and often socially burnt out. We would call 2-4 times a week to make up for it. We would go on a date/ hang out about once a month.

Starting on January 1st, we have not called at all. I have asked numerous times to call, and she says she does not want to. She says that due to her medication, she does not feel the need to socialize with anybody at all. She still texts me, but less frequently and with more dry responses. Last weekend, she would open my messages and leave me on read. I asked her about it, and she said that she just wanted to be left alone rather than be responding to the messages. She has mentioned that she plans on changing her medication due to these side effects and how stressed she is about them.

Yet, I feel singled out as someone she is not socializing with. She does not want to call me but will be on calls with her friends on Discord. She does not want to hang out with me, but will go to a coffee shop with her friends and invite her friend to hang out with her at work (she works on campus and is allowed to do this).

Last night I asked her why even though she is not feeling social with anyone, she will allow hanging out and calling with her friends and not me. She said that the main reason she had hung out with them was to help them with homework. I told her that I missed her and that I can't I have any time like them to see or hear her, she said that she was not trying to go to a psych ward and I that she dislikes how I am asking her to do stuff. She continued to say she is trying very hard not to flip out on me and everyone.

After she responded that way, I felt very selfish for asking for her attention and putting my needs before her own. I feel like shit for asking her about this while she is not doing well, but I still feel hurt and alone.

I am in my 30s and he is 11 years older. I am submissive and traditional by nature and I knew he has a desire for control. We thought that must be a match alongside other things and if it works as a kink it will work with everything. I am pretty naive and did not have much experience. Very soon in our relationship tho he started pointing out everything that I do that he finds wrong and controlled every moment of my life such as if I had more coffee then he allows or if I was using internet. I was owervelmed and my intuition told me to run. I told him that I would like to get care also and for my feelings to be acknowlaged but I did not feel I am with a strong man, more with a sociopath- but that is just my interpretation. He did care for me in material way or would love to spend time with me but if I would express any type of problem I have it seams he would be burdened by it and told me why did I ruin date by talking about that (problems that don't include him). 

I have spend next years crying and having breakdowns at least every 2 months where I would tell him that all I do is for him, I look, eat, dress, behave just as he is asking me to and if I am failing I am so sorry becouse changing your whole self for someone takes time. He would look at me crying on the floor and said I am acting to get him to do something. I said that is how my father would always tell me and was breaking my heart as a child since my tears do not come from wanting something but from terrible pain. He never, even once agreed there is so much pressure on me, he truly believes all of required things are easy to do and I am just too sensitive or having a toddler tantrum. Every time after fight I would come the next day and apologize for everything and would blame myself for everything and would continue to smile and be happy and clean and cook for a happy home. When sadness and anxiaty I have next to him become too big I would cry again and he would ask- So what happened, you were fine. Why do you always do this? 
I have explained to him multiple times I am not fine but I am trying to push it down and I believed if I do more I will somehow stop having anxiaty with him. He is an engineer and he works a lot but from home and he works all day long which is not necessary but he wants to learn and better himself in extra houts. I always supported that and I take child, house, me working out and looking good for him, cooking...With time I developed severe anxiaty of speaking since if I speak he tells me to shorten it becouse he has work and needs peace. I do not enjoy my topics and passions becouse he would usually tell me I am thinking wrong or it's childish. When he feels like having free time we go out, dine, watch movies, play with our child and it's a nice energy (that I keep by trying to be nice) therefore when I expressed I am so lonely (emotionally) and I wish for passion, hell even bdsm and to feel like a woman who is accross the table of a man who enjoys her, talks philosophy with her and wants to eat her alive, he called me ungrateful and sex/bdsm obsessed and he  gave a house, don't need to work and paid thing for (I gave my only life saving to him btw even tho he didn't ask for). He says honeymoon phase does not last and life comes but what is so huge I am asking for? I always blame myself and apologize and I believed for years I am ungratefull until few months ago my body start giving up to me and I am uncontrollably crying and screaming. Every inch of me wants to leave him but my child will always be a priority and I ask myself should I stay and start having medication to numb myself and keep giving my son happy life as he has now. My husband is a great father, a hard worker, disciplined and fair family man and there is so much I am thankfully to him about but I am always nervous around him and I feel, as a woman I died, I am dry, broken, alone and sad and for some reason that feeling is choking me. Am I being irrational and bad? And please can anyone tell me iIs there such a thing as separation where child is still having a happy life or is staying my only option?

I have to adress that I have PTSD and OCD and I do understand people with those problems may be exaggerating or reacting from past trauma but I also believe alot of us are willing to end up with people who treat us badly but we are unable to see it. Our reactions may be huge but that doesn't mean there was not pain inflicted on us to make us react that way. I've tried telling my husband for years that he doesn't call me names or actress if I cry and is he not having empathy to see me broken? He said he loves me so much but feels I am acting since there is nothing for me to cry about since he gave me a great life and made me a woman I am and that he believes I am mentally ill adding in the same breath- yes, he does not feel empathy.
I am extreamly confused have I imagined things and am I ungrateful and ruining my family as he says. Could it be that I am mentally ill as he is claiming? I am constantly crying.
I told him a month ago we are finnished and we should make a plan how to go trough it with best interests for our child. I made 1 post online few days ago and someone started talking to me as comfort and I told my husband immediately I am talking to a random man. For 5 days he kept working and not addressing me being so unwell and then runs in blasting I am a whore and my son will hate me. He said he felt pain watching me to this but thought I need to vent to someone which I said I would never let if it was reverse and is excuse for being lazy and not trying to save marriage. I am super monogamous and never did a thing like this and I also never talked sexual things with this person- they don't know my identity. But I became desperate for someone to tell me I have value and my feelings are real. I said I am not ashamed and would talk to anyone the same anonymously and I announced break up before. It breaks my heart for the pain I caused him and I chatted only for few days but for some reason I was so lonely and deprived of affection and wanting the person to spend time with me online. What is happening to me?
His family has similar cold, domineering and strange pattern of behaviour and his ex wife literally ran out of his parents house. But is it that becouse I am too sensitive I crate much bigger problems out of this? I am from Europe and my partner is from Middle East..

BACKGROUND:  I spent 20 years in IT (DC/storage/compute) and have dabbled in network/wan tech (riverbed, ...) but am not a network tech/do not have my CCNP+ - call me a rusty/out-of-practice CCNA equivalent at best.  I used to keep a full lab at my house (netapp filer, old cisco ucs, ...) running an exchange server, vmvware lab, yadda-yadda but decommed it all about 10 years ago b/c I got sick of maintaining it all + I moved from engineering to sales (= got a frontal lobotomy)



BASIC WANTS/NEEDS:  

\-  Something \*reasonably\* simple/easy to maintain (totally relative I know - but don't want to patch/maintain/fix constantly)

\-  Home/personal use only .. with caveat that I do want to be able to add/connect a few other remote ""sites"" - my in-law's and parents + potentially my kids

\-  Easy-to-use VPN - for both sites and devices

\-  NO MONTHY FEES - hate them, no thanks

\-  Better control/visibility than my current Asus gateway/router/wifi ap combo device running tomato/Merlin

\-  Not spending $1000+ on a setup



ADDITIONAL DETAILS:

\-  no Protect necessary (using a combo of Ring and Wyze atm and it's fine/good enough - though I suppose if there were an easy upgrade + compelling reason to move I'd entertain it)

\-  no Talk, or any of the other access controls - just using it in my house w/ Home Assistant, Plex, and ""normal"" geeky stuff

\-  do want IPS/IDS

\-  no dual-wan failover necessary - although if there's a reasonable way to utilize one of my extra tmobile lines as an emergency failover I'd consider it (not going to pay for the At&t Unifi service)

\-  using xfinity currently - 500Mbps - ideally want something to scale up to 1 gig if/when I eventually upgrade

\-  would strongly prefer 2.5GbE ports vs 1GbE on device

\-  have a slight preference for a gateway that would run Network natively ... but have many machines I can spin up a VM on and run an app if it makes more sense

\-  Windows-centric administration when possible

\-  



CURRNELY OWN:

USW-LITE-8-POE - UniFi Lite 8-Port Gigabit PoE+ Compliant Managed Switch

USW-FLEX-MINI - USW Flex Mini 5-Port Gigabit Managed Switch

U6-PRO-US - Ubiquiti Networks WiFi 6 Pro Dual-Band Access Point



WHAT I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING/CONSIDERING:

UCG-Max - Cloud Gateway Max @ $279 (2.5Gb = plus)

UXG-Max - Gateway Max @ $199 w/ 2.5GbE WAN + 4 2.5GbE LAN ports & 1.5 Gbps IDS/IPS ... Overkill = UXG-Pro @$499 (10GbE)

\+ Dream machines i.e. - UDR - Unifi Dream Router



Here's what I think I understand now RE: UXG-Max vs UCG-Max = https://community.ui.com/questions/UXG-Max-vs-UCG-Max-what-choice/608fcbe1-c7a9-4e01-815c-0e6c01886f0c

\*\*\*\*\*The main difference is that UXG can be adopted to Network Application running on a CK or Cloud Hosting. A Cloud Gateway cannot be adopted to another instance of Network and cannot adopt and manage other Gateways.\*\*\*\*



Looking for recommendations on the best purchase and software setup for my application where I \*think\* it's either a UXG-Max or UCG-Max.  Add in some complexity in that I'd like to be able to connect devices from my home network - call it SEASite01 to a few other networks - call them SEASite02 and SJCSite01.  Purpose of this would be:



1.  setup geodispersed, off-site backup at two other sites

2.  be able to have a PC at SEASite01 appear to be at SJCSite01 - i.e. so I could leverage xfinity live streaming as if the device was 1000 miles away in that local network

3.  easy remote troubleshooting



WHERE I NEED HELP/RECOMMENDATIONS: 

\- Where does the cloudkey come into the picture?  ... I think I can likely ignore cloudkey b/c I ?think? I don't want to treat the remote sites (SEASite02 and SJCSite01) as managed-service sites but rather unique instances that I have a VPN/SD-WAN/something connection to but not 100% clear on this

\- If primary SEASite01 is set at 192.168.1.xxx & SEASite02 = 192.168.2.xxx and SJCSite01 = 192.168.3.xxx  - can I setup a windows pc at SEASite01 (.1.xxx) to effectively have a .2.xxx (or .3.xxx) address without running a VPN 24/7/365?

\-  Can I easily change the ""location"" of the devices anywhere in this extended network?

\-  Is there any point/benefit to actually paying for VPN service when I can just tunnel back to my primary site when traveling for work/pleasure?  ... yes, I get the security aspects of going to my banking site when in the airport lounge/at a coffee shop - so ignore those for the time-being

\- At my primary, home site - is the UXG-Max or UCG-Max my best bet/gives me the most flexibility

\- At the secondary sites, can I run something like a UDR - Unifi Dream Router for maximum simplicity and best bang-for-the-buck (i.e. - it'll be at my mother-in-laws and needs to be trouble-free/easy to use once setup)?



Tried to provide plenty (too much :) detail but hit me with any additional questions as I need to make a move and buy ASAP.



Thanks in advance

I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for over a year, and our relationship has always been wonderful. He’s incredibly sweet, attentive, and caring—the kind of partner anyone would want. However, there has been a recurring issue with his best friend (24F).

She seems very possessive of his time and has gotten upset or jealous when he’s chosen to spend time with me instead of her. This happens despite the fact that he still makes time to see her weekly. I don’t demand his time; he spends it with me willingly, yet she often throws tantrums. One example was during a group hangout when she stormed out after learning that he and I wanted to plan a trip together—one she had hoped he’d take with her instead.

Recently, something happened that really hurt me. My grandmother passed away unexpectedly, and it’s been devastating. During this time, my boyfriend wanted to comfort me and turned down a lunch with his best friend two days after the funeral. She got upset and told him she felt neglected, despite knowing the situation. She didn’t even offer her condolences when he explained what had happened.

He spoke to her about how inappropriate her reaction was, and she seemed to understand. However, this isn’t the first time she’s been disrespectful to our relationship or acted possessively, and the cycle keeps repeating. I’ve told him I’d prefer not to interact with her anymore, and he agreed. But yesterday, while I was at work, he got coffee with her.

Now I feel stuck. On one hand, I know he’s trying to balance his relationships and I feel guilty for having such strong feelings about who he spends time with, but on the other hand, it hurts that he continues to engage with someone who has disrespected me and our relationship multiple times. I don’t know if I should bring this up again or if I need to figure out a way to move past it.

How would you approach a situation like this?

Stool - My stool has become almost like tar. Dark brown. Wet wipes are a must. It’s so sticky/tar like that even after flushing remains are still inside the bowl requiring a brush to remove. Wondering what’s up with that?

Supplements - been sticking to strictly spring water like avian. But notice some people take supplements. If I try a longer fast I’m guessing electrolytes will be a necessity. Are vitamins/coffee okay? Been having trouble sleeping. What about melatonin?

Any insight is much appreciated.

","Disclaimer: this story took place over 8 years ago and I still think about it often. I realize I might come off as a little shit back in the day, and I do put myself in my ex friends spot and as an adult now I do empathize for her but I constantly think about this scenario so I need others opinion. 

So my best friend at the time was the first to turn 16 in my friend group. Because of that, she was the only one driving us when we would all hang out. Not that we forced her, she just happened to be the first and only driver. Once others got their liscenses, obviously it was easier to split up the driving burden. 

But my friend at the time would give me rides to school or home and because of that, I would buy her coffees in the morning or buy her meals whenever we would hangout and go out on occasion. BUT on top of that, she would also ask for gas money on top of that. Personally that is where I drew the line because she didn’t even pay for her gas or car in anyway. He parents bought her the car and she had her parents credit card to pay for her gas whenever she needed. I didn’t know that at first, but I would give her gas money at first. So I would give her the money and then We’d go to grab fast food and then she would use the money I literally just gave her for gas to pay for her meal. That honestly threw me off because she said the money was for “gas” and It just annoyed me because again, she wasn’t paying for her car in anyway. 

My friend and I at the time got into a dispute over it, and with many other problems, we pretty much stopped being friends.  In the past i thought she was being slimy with money but now, I do understand she might’ve felt “used” and being taken advantage of. But genuinely, that wasn’t the intent of me or our other friends. 

So every once in awhile I think of that scenario and wonder, was she in the wrong, or was I? Or were we both? AND AGAIN, this is an old story, it’s not the serious or deep. Lol",1,1737145821.0,AmItheAsshole,4,0.67,False

Exercising right now is extremely painful, uncomfortable and discouraging. But I know diet is about 80%, so I'm trying to cut back but every time in the past that I've tried I've gotten so overwhelmed counting calories. 



How do you log every single calorie meticulously without feeling like that's all you do all day? Or how to not feel terrible about eating and avoid calories altogether? Eventually logging calories was so tedious that it made me not even want to eat at all. Maybe that's the point I don't know. 



What if I take one bite of something? How many calories was that? Do I tare the spoon on a scale and weigh the bite? What if I try a sip of my girlfriends coffee, how many calories is a sip? What if I weigh every ingredient first before preparing something but I drop some stuff or discard some of the original amount. Or how do I know the exact proportions of each ingredient I'm getting per serving? Some things are not homogenous by nature so each serving will *technically* be a little different depending if you get more say beans than rice, or more of one vegetable than another in your particular serving. 




Aside from eating everything prepackaged and labeled, how do you reasonably count calories without feeling like it's the most tedious thing ever and go crazy? It feels like I spend 30 minutes+ a day calculating calories and still feel like I'm not exactly right, so I just want to not eat anything because it's such a pain in the ass to log every bite or sip of everything. 



Again is that the point? Make eating so tedious and inconvenient that I never want to do it? 



Any tips please, maybe I'm just a perfectionist but this is always maddening to me how to exactly accurately track calories without feeling like that's the only thought in your brain 24/7",23,1737145801.0,loseit,63,0.85,False

Used the Underbelly Base Recipe with the substitution of Coconut Milk in for Heavy Cream and Gelling Sugar in place of dextrose and invert sugar, see below:

Makes about 700ml of base (scaled down from the original Underbelly recipe) 
 
140g whole milk lactose-free milk
400g  coconut milk (Goya Brand)
41.25g nonfat dry milk
2 large egg yolks

10g of Coffee Liqueur/Saccharum
 
0.6g locust bean gum 
0.3g guar gum
0.1g lambda carrageenan
0.525g salt

Directions: 

Blend all the dry ingredients together thoroughly. Then mix with wet ingredients using an immersion blender. 

Sous vide at 75C for 45mins.

Immersion Blend hot to incorporate a bit more air and homogenize the mixture.

Layer Black Sesame Base on a chilled bowl, then crumbled Parle-G toasted in Ghee, then a quenelle of the Ice Cream. Top with Chai Masala.

But what’s been even more magical lately are the small, seemingly insignificant things that bring me so much peace and calm. 

Here are a few that have become my daily rituals:

* Making a cup of coffee or tea, holding the cup and soaking in the warmth between each sip.
* Listening to the soothing pitter-patter of gentle rain.
* Reading a good book.
* Writing and journaling my thoughts.
* Taking a 5-minute breathing exercise to center myself.
* Going for walks, especially in my local park.
* Browsing books at a library, my bookshelf, or a bookstore.
* Jamming out to my favorite songs.
* Cozying up in my blankets and pillows - made myself a nest. 

Life is chaotic and fast-paced, especially in today’s world, but I find myself falling more and more in love with the simple, beautiful moments. I hope this resonates with someone and helps you find small moments of joy in your own life.

What are some of your small self-care rituals? Feel free to share—I'd love to hear what brings you peace!",6,1737145698.0,selfcare,1,1.0,False

Today I decided to go to my work office and I was struggling a bit in the overground and tube when I accidentally put more weight on my boot. That's when I realised that I can do more than I thought I could and long story short an hour later I could actually walk small steps without crutches and actually carry a cup of coffee without imposing to someone to carry it for me.

Although I tried a few times to walk without crutches I decided to not push it, and for the rest of the day I mainly used one of the crutches as a walking stick against the bad leg.

End of the working day and returning home I feel my leg quite tired and sore but not really in pain. I am nervous if I could have damaged it accidentally, so I wanted to hear some other experiences too.",2,1737145429.0,brokenbones,2,1.0,False

McLean's Specialty Foods quickly became a beloved institution in Nanaimo and beyond, known for its exceptional selection and personal service.

As Eric and Sandy transition into retirement, they are delighted to pass the torch to Jamie, Kerry, Dave, and Rhea--four long-time Nanaimo residents who share the same passion for high-quality, globally AND locally-sourced food.

""I am beyond excited to step into retirement and leave McLean's in such capable hands,"" said Eric McLean, who earned the nickname ""The Big Cheese"" for both his stature and in-depth knowledge of the cheese industry. ""Jamie, Kerry, Dave, and Rhea are the perfect team to take McLean's Specialty Foods to new heights, and I know the store will continue to be a place where food enthusiasts can discover the best products available.""

The new ownership group is committed to maintaining the beloved traditions of McLean's, ensuring that all staff members will be offered continued employment.

Customers can expect to find all of the specialty cheeses and gourmet groceries that have made McLean's a favourite, with even more exciting offerings in the future.

""We are thrilled to continue the legacy of McLean's Specialty Foods, building on the foundation Eric and Sandy have created over the years,"" said Kerry Martini. ""Our goal is to stay true to the values of quality, service, and community that McLean's is known for, while also introducing new ideas and expanding the product selection to include more of the local and specialty products our collective customers love.""

McLean's Specialty Foods will remain open throughout the transition, and all current offerings will continue to be available, with updates on new products and initiatives coming in the near future. Eric encourages all customers to use their McLean's gift certificates ASAP before the transition that is planned for March.

I had 2 store managers from other stores come and help me (ASM) get it looking all nice and cleared out. 

Upon clearing out, one of the store managers found BAGS of ""damages"" that weren't damages at all and called my DM. I went through the bags with them and was shocked at how much stuff (mostly prp, toys, a whole box of coffee mugs) were in those bags. 

I don't do dry damages because I do literally everything else. And it was obvious who it would've led back to. (My SM) 

My DM has found bags like this before and questioned my SM and nothing really came of that. But I think this time my SM could be in serious trouble. Anyone know what could happen next if they even decide to investigate it? We love our SM but as of late she's been burnt out, not at the store when she should be and just honestly doesn't give a shit about the store anymore.

1i3pnio,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1i3pnio/americanization_about_tipping/,“Americanization” about tipping?,"I live in Berlin and had a weird situation today at a cafe. It’s a kinda hipster type of place, where cappuccino costs 6 euro. I went there only because a friend really wanted to check it out… otherwise this wouldn’t be on my to go list. I ordered at the counter as they have self-service only and when I was about to pay, I was directly asked “don’t you want to tip?” I got a bit confused and in the end I replied that “I think i’m fine” and the guy took it quite bad. Like, he gave me this passive-aggressive comment of “well that’s not really polite but you’ll get your order soon, have a good day” and ended it with completely turning his face to the next customer, who was my friend. Of course he didn’t tip him. Now that I’ve been thinking about it since I’m still pissed, it occurred to me that I’ve recently seen at least a few places where tipping became very suggestive (aka displayed on the terminal for you to choose 10-15-25% with additional option “other” as the only way to put 0%). Don’t get me wrong, when I’m at a nice restaurant/cafe/bar and if the service is good (which in Berlin it’s usually quite random), I’d tip. But the guy from the cafe seemed completely convinced that he should receive the tip for just taking my order (while it was clearly handled by his co-worker who was preparing the coffees). The whole situation reminded me of this American way of dealing with tips aka it’s the way for the staff to actually make a living. In Germany, to my understanding, they must earn the minimum wage at least, which doesn’t seem so bad and it certainly doesn’t justify the need to tip for literally putting the order into the system. So I don’t know, am I overreacting it and being a typical millennial, or is the tipping becoming really fucked up?",182,1737145031.0,germany,92,0.94,False

---

Have you ever noticed how some people seem to have an aura that lights up a room? It’s as if good things gravitate toward them, and they exude an energy that makes others want to be around them. This phenomenon isn’t magic—it’s optimism in action. Optimism, at its core, is a mindset that focuses on the possibility of good outcomes and embraces challenges with hope and resilience. The phrase “Optimism is a happiness magnet” captures this beautifully. Staying positive doesn’t just make you feel better; it can draw opportunities, relationships, and success into your life like a magnet attracting iron.  

Let’s dive into what makes optimism so powerful and why it works as a force for good in our lives.  

---

### **The Science of Optimism: Why Positivity Works**  
There’s actual science backing the claim that optimism is a happiness magnet. Studies in psychology and neuroscience have shown that our brains are wired to seek patterns and respond to stimuli in ways that align with our mindset. When we focus on positive outcomes, our brains become more adept at spotting opportunities. This phenomenon, often called the ""Reticular Activating System"" (RAS), is like a mental filter that highlights what we focus on.  

For instance, have you ever decided to buy a specific car, and suddenly, you start seeing that car everywhere? That’s your RAS at work. Now imagine applying this principle to optimism. When you maintain a positive outlook, your brain tunes itself to recognize possibilities, solutions, and even kindred spirits who share your energy.  

On the flip side, a negative mindset can have the opposite effect. It narrows your focus, making challenges seem insurmountable and pushing away potential allies. Optimism doesn’t eliminate difficulties, but it gives you the tools to face them with grace.  

---

### **Personal Reflections: When Optimism Changed My Life**  
I remember a particularly tough period in my life when everything seemed to be going wrong. I was juggling a stressful job, dealing with family challenges, and feeling utterly drained. At some point, I decided to change my approach. Instead of dwelling on what was going wrong, I made a conscious effort to focus on small victories—a productive meeting, a kind gesture from a stranger, or even just a good cup of coffee.  

Something incredible happened. Not only did my mood improve, but I began noticing opportunities I’d previously overlooked. A casual conversation with a colleague led to a new project I loved. An old friend reached out, rekindling a friendship that became a vital source of support. These weren’t random coincidences; they were the result of shifting my focus and energy.  

This isn’t to say optimism magically fixes everything. But it changes the lens through which you see the world, making it easier to attract good things and good people.  

---

### **Optimism in Relationships: How Positivity Connects Us**  
Let’s talk about people. Have you ever been drawn to someone who constantly complains or radiates negativity? Probably not. On the other hand, optimistic people are like magnets. Their positive energy is contagious, making them enjoyable to be around.  

Think about the most uplifting person you know. Chances are, they’re someone who sees the best in others and tackles life with a sense of hope. This doesn’t mean they’re naive or ignore problems; it means they choose to focus on what’s possible rather than what’s lacking.  

Optimism fosters trust and connection. When you believe in the goodness of others and the potential for positive outcomes, you create an environment where people feel safe and valued. This is especially important in personal relationships, where positivity can strengthen bonds and help navigate conflicts with understanding and patience.  

---

### **The Ripple Effect of Positivity**  
Optimism doesn’t just benefit you—it has a ripple effect. When you radiate positivity, it influences those around you. It’s like throwing a pebble into a pond; the waves spread outward, touching everything in their path.  

I once volunteered at a local community event, and one of the organizers was an older gentleman who seemed to embody optimism. Despite a million things going wrong—from bad weather to logistical hiccups—he remained upbeat and solution-focused. His energy was infectious, inspiring everyone to work harder and enjoy the process. By the end of the event, people were smiling and sharing stories, and it felt like we had accomplished something truly meaningful.  

This ripple effect extends to larger communities. Positive leaders inspire teams to innovate, optimistic parents raise resilient children, and hopeful communities tackle challenges with creativity and unity.  

---

### **Challenges to Staying Positive**  
Let’s be real: optimism isn’t always easy. Life can be messy, painful, and overwhelming. Staying positive in the face of adversity requires effort and practice. It’s not about ignoring difficulties but about choosing to look beyond them.  

One strategy I’ve found helpful is reframing. Instead of seeing setbacks as failures, I try to view them as learning experiences. Did a project flop? It’s a chance to analyze what went wrong and improve. Did someone let me down? It’s an opportunity to set boundaries and understand my needs better.  

Another key is gratitude. Focusing on what you have rather than what you lack can shift your perspective dramatically. Keeping a gratitude journal, where you jot down three things you’re thankful for each day, is a simple but powerful way to cultivate optimism.  

---

### **A Word on Authenticity**  
It’s important to note that optimism isn’t about pretending everything is fine when it’s not. Authenticity matters. People can sense when positivity is genuine versus forced. Being optimistic doesn’t mean you can’t feel sadness, anger, or frustration—it means you don’t let those emotions define you.  

Authentic optimism acknowledges the challenges while choosing to focus on hope and possibility. It’s about finding a balance between realism and positivity, creating a mindset that’s both grounded and uplifting.  

---

### **Why Optimism Is a Choice Worth Making**  
At the end of the day, optimism is a choice. It’s a mindset that you cultivate through practice, intention, and self-awareness. By staying positive, you’re not just attracting good things—you’re also becoming a source of goodness for others.  

Imagine a world where more people embraced optimism. Workplaces would be more collaborative, communities more compassionate, and individuals more resilient. While we can’t control everything that happens to us, we can control how we respond. And that response can shape our reality in profound ways.  

So, why not give it a try? Start small. Focus on the good in your day, even if it’s just one thing. Share a kind word with someone. Approach challenges with curiosity instead of fear. You might be surprised by the ripple effects—not just in your life, but in the lives of those around you.  

Optimism isn’t just a happiness magnet—it’s a life magnet. It pulls you toward your best self and opens doors you didn’t even know were there.

I started uni back in September, and there’s this girl in my accommodation who I’ve grown really close to. We just click in a way I’ve never experienced before. We’ve been out together quite a bit—trips to the cinema, coffee outings, mini golf, drinks, and even uni events. After Christmas, she even gave me a keyring gift.

For some context, I’m 20M and she’s 19F. I’ve never had a girlfriend before or much of a social life, so this whole experience is new territory for me. I’ve never found it easy to connect with girls in the past, but with her, it feels natural and comfortable. That said, I’m still figuring things out as I go.

Every interaction with her feels different, sometimes I’m confident, other times I overthink or feel awkward. All I’m trying to do is be myself because I know that’s the only way this can work.

But my mind keeps torturing me with endless ""what ifs.""

What if she doesn’t like me the same way and only sees me as a friend?

What if she does like me, but we’re both waiting for the other to act?

What if I’ve said something awkward or wrong, and it’s changed how she sees me?

I’ll go from having an amazing day with her—laughing, having deep conversations, and feeling like things are heading somewhere—to overthinking the next interaction. If it doesn’t live up to my expectations, I start blaming myself or replaying every word I said, convincing myself I’ve ruined everything.

I think part of this is because I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I think i really like her—she’s kind, funny, and supportive. She even encourages me with my uni work and helps me stay grounded. I know i put a lot of pressure on myself to make everything perfect and nothing is.

I know I’m an overthinker, and sometimes I blow small moments out of proportion. If she’s tired or not as chatty one day, I automatically assume I’ve done something wrong, even though I know deep down that’s not true.

I don’t know exactly what I hope to achieve by posting this—maybe just to get some perspective or advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation. I’m trying to focus on enjoying the process, learning from it, and being patient. But I can’t shake the feeling that I don’t want to let this slip away or end up stuck in limbo because neither of us made a move.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I guess I’m just trying to figure out how to balance my emotions, stop overthinking, and trust that being myself is enough. Any advice would mean a lot.",1,1737144846.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False
