TIA!!,"Hello, recently i’ve discovered that adding sweet cold foam to hot drinks is a controversial topic amongst my fellow coffee enjoyers. I understand that because it melts quickly and is “essentially the same as whip cream just more expensive” it’s an unusual request and makes me look foolish to the barista taking my order which then leads to them assuming i wanted my drink cold haha. I’ve also come to understand how it’s inconvenient for the baristas making my order as it’s an additional process when making my order. I really enjoy the sweet flavor and foamy texture the SCF adds to my bev and am unfamiliar with what other options there are for modifying my order. 

TLDR: i’d like to know what should i order instead of the cold foam with my hot drinks? would it just be whipped cream and a splash of sweet cream? im someone with social anxiety so i really want to make things easier for everyone involved haha (:",1,1753923536.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I didn’t want to spend too much, so I looked into the cheaper options and ended up going with Private Internet Access. The two-year plan was super affordable and I haven’t had any issues with it so far.

What surprised me is that I’ve actually saved money with it too. A few times I was booking flights and tried switching my location with the VPN—some prices were lower depending on the country I picked. Doesn’t work every time, but it worked enough that it made a difference. I’ve also used it to find cheaper subscription prices for a couple of apps.

Another thing I like is just the peace of mind. I’ve connected to random coffee shop WiFi so many times and now I don’t stress about it as much. It runs quietly in the background and doesn’t slow anything down for me.

If you’re trying to stay secure online without spending a ton, going for a budget VPN is honestly a solid choice. Just make sure to grab a long-term deal and pick one that lets you use it on multiple devices. That way you get the most out of it.",1,1753923529.0,VPN_Reviewer,0,1.0,False

1mdnvl4,https://i.redd.it/a9qmegnry3gf1.jpeg,Today's Scent Combo & True Blue Review! (Impressed & Surprised!),"Hey B&BW Fam!

So I'll be honest, I had never heard of this line, in the past. I was an occasional shopper throughout the year. I would just buy Men's body cream and hand soaps. But this year specifically, I got way more into BBW including candles & candle holders especially! I love using the candle holders for my decor! 

Anyways, when I first smelled this a few months ago when it was released, I thought it was overhyped. 

I smelled it in store & thought, ""this doesn't smell like anything!"" lol 

I recently needed an exfoliating body wash & noticed the line had one. I had four rewards to redeem, so I used it on this. I then got the matching shower cream and body cream in hopes of leaving my skin moisturized & soft. I also got the foot cream from this line with my remaining reward.

I feel like society puts a stigma on Men that caring for your skin is very feminine and more for women. I grew up around women & only had sisters, so I guess I know more than the average guy. But my first job as a teen was at Macy's & I got into Clinique thanks to the ladies at the beauty counters who kind of introduced me to facial skincare. This led me to caring about my skin a lot & getting into skincare & trying different brands until I found what worked for me. People always compliment me on my clear skin & tell me I look younger than my actual age (32) which surprises me because I'm actually afraid of aging after seeing so many guys in my age group aging rapidly or balding already 😅

My favorite facial skincare brands are L'occitane, Shiseido, & lately I've been into Bubble. But for body care, I've been using BBW the past year religiously now lol! I abandoned L'occitane body care for BBW. 

They keep getting me with all these new scent & product releases! 😂

Anyways, to my surprise, the exfoliating body wash lathered up very well!! Definitely gave me a clean feeling & left my skin feeling soft & smooth! 

I used the Shower Cream after. I rinsed it off, but tried to not ""fully rinse"" to where all the product washes off after. 

When I got out the shower & dried up, I used the Super Rich Body Lotion... Let me tell you, they weren't lying when they say ""Super Rich!"" lol!  I used the same amount as all the other body creams (I always buy body creams and not lotion) & using the same amount as the regular body creams was a mistake! 

The cream is almost as rich as body butter, if not even more I'd say. I waited 10 minutes for my skin to absorb it & it still didn't!! Made me feel ""wet"" still even when I put on my t-shirt, but my skin was definitely ultra moisturized. I now know to use less body cream for that product specifically. But if you have dry skin, I would VERY much recommend it! 

Dare I say, this is their most moisturizing cream I've ever used! 

I'll have to stock up more during the next body care sale. I don't like to buy too much because I know that then product goes bad, but I'll buy at least one more set. 

I have yet to test the foot cream. I'll try it on before bed.

This goes to show you should NOT be like me and judge a product initially based on the scent alone! lol 😂 

The scent is light and fresh, I'm just used to strong scents now, thanks to BBW. I'm currently really enjoying Vanilla Cafe as well. I was supposed to save Vanilla Cafe for fall, but have been using it almost daily now. I couldn't help waiting because I love coffee scents so much! 

Anyways, after using the body cream, I topped it off with ""At the Beach"" mist. I love the freshness of this scent & how it really does remind me of the freshness & smell of the beach. This scent is also very gender neutral in my opinion. 

I do wish True Blue line would have included a Fragrance Mist as well, but overall pleased & I did feel like I had a ""Spa"" experience at home! 

I also enjoy the glossy packaging. I appreciate the nice packaging sometimes! 

Let me know if you all recommend any other True Blue products or any recommendations in general!

My family and I will be in Paris (for the first time!) in the last week of October and I just wanted to get an idea to see if my itinerary was looking ok or if anything needed to be moved around. For reference, we're going to be staying in the 20th Arrondissement.

Day 1: Arrive by Eurostar in the afternoon from London. Get off, make our way to our airbnb, grab some food on the way. Nothing planned - do something close and local for dinner.

Day 2: Wake up and after breakfast head of Trocadero. We'll check it out, get some photos, then make our way over to the Eiffel Tower. We'll head up (I know everyone says to do it as early in the day as possible, but by the time we have breakfast, head up to Trocadero, and head over to the Eiffel Tower, it'll probably mid-late morning?) After we're done, we're going to go see the Arc de Triomphe, but not climb it. Before we head home, we'll go find some good places to buy some cheese, bread and wine to snack on. We don't have anything else planned for today, so we'll just be chilling for the rest of day exploring Paris and going where our hearts (and probably noses and stomachs!) tell us to go.

Day 3: Have breakfast, then head over to do Notre Dame and Sainte-Chapelle. I've recently found out the line to get into Sainte-Chapelle can be quite long, so not sure how long to plan to be here, but I think we'll have tickets to Notre Dame booked around 11ish and Sainte-Chapelle around 2ish? That way we can go see Notre Dame, have lunch, then go to Sainte-Chapelle? Or is that too little time for it all? Once that's done, we'll head over to the catacombs for an afternoon tour. We'll have dinner in Montparnasse area since we want to do Montparnasse Tower in the evening to get a view of the Eiffel Tower as it lights up - we'll probably book something around 7:30 or 8:30 (so we can be up on the hour for the sparkes!)

Day 4: Rest day. Nothing planned. We'll just wing this one on the day and see if there's anything we want to do. Maybe we'll go check out some parks and read, or we'll go sit and have coffees and people watch, or we'll walk along the Siene or just sleep in all day! Who knows!

Day 5: The Palace of Versailles. We won't be able to get there super early, so were thinking of getting there around 10-11. We'll check out everything, see all the cool stuff, and then head back into the city. Nothing else planned for the day except for a river cruise at night. We're still deciding if we'll do a dinner cruise or a sightseeing cruise, but either way we'll have a nice dinner and cruise on the Siene for our final night in Paris. Also, if anyone has any recommendations that aren't too expensive (our exchange rate to EUR is terrible at the moment) for a good place for dinner, or a sightseeing/dinner cruise, I'd love them! After the cruise, we'll head back home for the night.

Day 6: Head to the airport to leave Paris (unfortunately). See how many croissants we can fit into our stomachs and suitcases before we have to leave. I'm hoping at least 100!

So that's pretty much it! How does everything look? Is it too much? A good amount? Would you change anything like doing different things at different days/times? It's our first time in Paris (and Europe) and I just want to make sure things are looking good for it before we start buying all the tickets for everything!

It's a small world, so I'm sure others are experiencing this same issue and feel the same way as I do.

I grew up with a small but tight knit group of friends.  3 to be exact.  2 guys and one girl.  I had lots of acquaintances and classmates, but 3 that I would consider good friends that I talked to and hung out with daily.

I am now in my 40s and of those 3 friends, there is only one that I still message and see on a fairly regular basis.  The other 2 I havent physically seen in over 20 years and only a few times a year message or get messages from.  

There was no falling out, no arguments, just life happened.  We all got married and had kids and moved out of our hometowns, even though we all still live within an hours drive of one another  For years I reached out and tried to plan get togethers and tried to make plans to go see a show or just to sit and have coffee.  I tried to keep things status quo, but every instance was met with ""maybe another time, I've got plans already"" or "" I can't for (fill in the blank) reasons""

Eventually I just stopped trying.  I really miss the friendships the way they were, I miss just having conversations with my friends.  Its discouraging feeling like I am being a bother when I try to reach out.  I hate the one word replies I get back when I try to check on them and see how life is going.

The brim length and width also vary, influencing the level of sun protection and the cap's overall appearance.

## Key Features Analysis

coffee shampoos have become increasingly sophisticated, incorporating various ingredients and technologies to deliver optimal results. The best products offer a blend of caffeine stimulation, scalp health benefits, and overall hair conditioning.

**Caffeine Concentration:** The effectiveness of a coffee shampoo hinges on the caffeine concentration. Products boasting a higher percentage of caffeine, typically sourced from robusta or arabica beans, are generally considered more potent. Some shampoos also incorporate caffeine derivatives for enhanced absorption.

The percentage of caffeine in the shampoo is a crucial factor to consider. Look for a shampoo that clearly states the caffeine concentration, ideally within the range of 1-3% for noticeable effects.This concentration is generally considered safe for topical request and effective in stimulating hair follicles.

**Organic and Natural Ingredients:** Many consumers are increasingly seeking natural and organic hair care options. Leading coffee shampoos incorporate certified organic coffee extracts, as well as other botanical ingredients like aloe vera, argan oil, and rosemary extract. These additions provide moisturizing, soothing, and antioxidant benefits for the hair and scalp.

Opting for certified organic ingredients reduces the risk of exposure to harsh chemicals and pesticides. The inclusion of nourishing oils and extracts can further enhance the overall health and appearance of your hair, making it softer, shinier, and more manageable.**PH Balance:** Maintaining the proper pH balance is critical for hair health. A pH level that is too acidic or too alkaline can disrupt the natural oils of the scalp, leading to dryness, irritation, or even hair damage. High-quality coffee shampoos are formulated with a pH level that closely resembles the natural pH of the scalp, typically around 4.5 to 5.5.

Choosing a pH-balanced shampoo helps to maintain the integrity of the hair cuticle and promote a healthy scalp habitat. This is especially critically important for individuals with sensitive skin or those prone to scalp irritation.

**Sulfate-Free Formulation:** Sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), are common cleansing agents found in many shampoos.While effective at removing dirt and oil,sulfates can also strip the hair of its natural moisture,leading to dryness,frizz,and color fading. The best coffee shampoos are often formulated without sulfates, relying on gentler cleansing agents derived from natural sources.Sulfate-free shampoos are particularly beneficial for individuals with dry, damaged, or color-treated hair.They help to preserve moisture, reduce frizz, and extend the life of your hair color.

**Added Vitamins and Nutrients:** Some coffee shampoos go beyond basic caffeine stimulation and incorporate vitamins and nutrients to nourish the hair and scalp. Common additions include biotin, vitamin E, and various amino acids, which are known to promote hair growth, strengthen hair strands, and improve overall hair health.

The addition of vitamins and nutrients can further enhance the benefits of coffee shampoo, providing essential building blocks for healthy hair growth.These ingredients can help to repair damaged hair, reduce breakage, and improve the overall texture and appearance of your locks.

## Core Benefits

Coffee shampoos offer a unique set of advantages over customary hair care products, primarily due to the stimulant effects of caffeine and the nourishing properties of added ingredients.

**Stimulated Hair Growth:** Caffeine is known to stimulate blood circulation and encourage hair follicles to grow faster and stronger. Coffee shampoos can help to combat hair thinning and promote new hair growth, resulting in a fuller, thicker head of hair.
The caffeine in the shampoo penetrates the scalp and energizes hair follicles, perhaps reversing the effects of factors that contribute to hair loss. With consistent use, users may notice increased hair density and reduced shedding.

**Improved Scalp Health:** The gentle exfoliating properties of coffee can help to remove dead skin cells and unclog hair follicles, promoting a healthier scalp environment.This can reduce dandruff,dryness,and itchiness,leading to a more agreeable and balanced scalp.
A healthy scalp is essential for healthy hair growth. Coffee shampoos can help to maintain a clean and balanced scalp, reducing the risk of scalp conditions that can hinder hair growth.

**Enhanced Shine and Texture:** Coffee shampoos can help to smooth the hair cuticle, resulting in increased shine and a smoother, more manageable texture. The added oils and botanical extracts provide essential moisture and nourishment, leaving hair feeling soft, silky, and healthy.
The improved hair texture and enhanced shine can make hair look healthier and more vibrant. Coffee shampoos that contain beneficial oils can deeply hydrate the hair shaft, preventing breakage and split ends.

**Natural Hair Darkening:** While not a permanent hair dye, coffee can temporarily darken hair color, particularly on brown or black hair. Using coffee shampoo regularly can help to intensify your natural hair color and add depth and dimension.

this natural hair darkening effect can be a welcome choice to chemical dyes, which can be damaging to the hair. It offers a subtle and temporary color boost without the harmful side effects.

My question is how do you guys eat at work? In the morning I only have coffee because I’m too stressed to eat. I then try to get Tim Hortons on the way to work if I have time, most days I can’t so I don’t eat till lunch. I pack a lunch but there are so many issues at lunch, like I can’t eat infront of others so since we all eat together in the same room, I end up not eating. If I manage to escape to the washroom I can’t eat there either. I know I have an anxiety issue but I’m not taking anti-anxiety medication. I also like eating at home cause it takes me an hour to finish my sandwich and I only have 15 to 20 minutes to eat at work. It’s very stressful. Then I get home and my mom is traditional and forces me to always eat with the family what she’s made, and I hate most things she makes it’s probably why I’ve always been skinny. So I end up not eating dinner (I almost never do). 

I don’t see how I can fix this. All Grok says is to eat smaller bites with water to help the anxiety but this doesn’t help at all.

He found my Instagram, asked for my number, initiated plans for coffee, dinner, and drinks. We had a lot of fun and there seemed to be genuine interest from his side. But after a couple hangouts, things shifted. He’s still in contact — we text almost daily, usually in the evening — but he no longer initiates plans or keeps the same momentum he started with.
He always kept things very platonic and our conversations are almost all banter. At our last hangout almost two weeks ago, after a few drinks we did cuddle a bit but I did tell him I wasn’t going to kiss him that night and that I was aware that he liked me. 
There was an incident where he said he would back me home but then went off with another group of people, I was kind of hurt but he did keep apologizing after that. I tried initiating sometimes like asking for ice cream but he’ll play it off a joke, he knows my schedule and he’s usually busier than I am so I feel bad asking anything.
something I’ve noticed is a bit of a pattern with him. If there’s a lull in conversation, seeing me in person or online seems to prompt him to reconnect. He’ll ask me for photos of places I go to, we’ll banter, he’ll use “we” a lot in convos. But recently he’s been taking a while to respond to texts as well. 

There’s definitely chemistry, but also a lot of inconsistency. He seems shy in person, sometimes nervous or quiet around me, and yet will still text things that suggest interest — like saying he’d be “crying” if I didn’t come back to the office soon. I don’t want to push or overwhelm him, but I’m unsure how much of this is real interest vs. just surface-level banter. Is this something worth trying to keep alive, or is he slowly backing away and just being polite? I’d love some honest perspective.",2,1753922197.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

Okay, firstly... I'll absolutely admit that this may sound a bit odd at first, but hey, hear me out! 

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

1mdncyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mdncyk/i_dont_think_thats_my_wife_anymore_part_1/,I Don’t Think That’s My Wife Anymore (Part 1),"This isn't easy to talk about. Not after everything. Most days, I still can’t. My hands shake so much I can barely hold this pen, and my mind… it’s a spiderweb of shadows and whispers. But the doctor, the one who actually seems to believe me – or at least, pretends to – says writing it down might help. That maybe, if I can put it into words, I can finally untangle the knots in my head.

They call it PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I call it living in a permanent nightmare, a reality stretched and torn until it barely resembles the one I knew.

Before… before it all started, my life was good. Not just good, it was perfect. I had Sarah. Her name was Sarah. Just writing it down makes my throat tighten. She was everything. Her laugh, bright and clear like wind chimes. Her eyes, the color of warm honey, always crinkling at the corners when she smiled. The way she’d hum while cooking, or tuck her feet under her on the sofa, a book resting open on her chest. We lived in a small, two-story house, tucked away on a quiet street in the suburbs. A little slice of heaven, we called it. We’d bought it together, painted the walls, planted a garden. It was our sanctuary.

It was our coffin.

It began subtly. So subtly that for weeks, I dismissed it. Attributed it to stress, to my imagination, to the house settling. A faint smell, at first. Like damp earth, or maybe something a little sweeter, but cloying. I’d sniff the air, wander through the rooms, checking for leaks, for forgotten food. Sarah would laugh, say I was being paranoid. ""It's just the old house, Liam,"" she'd say, her voice warm, familiar. ""Breathing.""

Then came the sounds. Rustles from empty corners. A faint scratching, like nails on plaster, deep within the walls, usually when the house was quietest – late at night, or early in the morning before the world woke up. Sometimes, I’d swear I heard a soft, wet squelch. I’d freeze, heart hammering, straining to hear it again. But it would be gone. Just the creak of the floorboards, the distant hum of the refrigerator.

Sarah didn't seem to notice. Or if she did, she didn’t mention it. She’d sleep soundly beside me, her breathing even, undisturbed. And I, being the rational man I thought I was, tried to be like her. To ignore the growing prickle on my skin, the sense of being watched even in our own bedroom.

The first noticeable change came with the air. It grew colder. Not just a draft – a pervasive, bone-chilling cold that seemed to emanate from the very walls. I checked the heating, sealed windows, but it didn't help. Sarah started bundling up, wearing extra sweaters, but still, she dismissed my concerns. ""It's just winter coming, Liam. You're getting soft,"" she'd joke, but her smiles seemed a little… thinner. A little less genuine.

I told myself it was my imagination. I told myself I was tired. I told myself I was being ridiculous. I told myself a lot of things. And every single one of them was a lie I desperately needed to believe.

The house began to feel… wrong. Not just the cold, not just the smells or the phantom noises. It was a subtle shift in its very essence. The shadows seemed deeper, more alive. The natural sunlight, which used to pour in through our kitchen window, felt muted, filtered through something unseen. The wallpaper in the hallway, a soft floral pattern Sarah had picked out, seemed to warp just at the edges when I wasn't looking directly at it.

And Sarah… she started to change too.

It wasn't overnight. It was a creeping, insidious alteration. Little things, at first, that I wrote off as stress or fatigue. She’d always been a morning person, chirpy and bright. Now, she lingered in bed, often not stirring until I nudged her. Her movements, once graceful and fluid, became… precise. A little too precise. Like she was thinking about each step, each gesture.

I remember one morning, she was making coffee. She always used to hum a little tune while she ground the beans. That morning, she stood perfectly still, her back to me, the grinder whirring. Her shoulders were hunched, and for a split second, I saw a strange, almost convulsive twitch in her left arm, quickly suppressed. When she turned, her smile was there, but her eyes… her eyes were flat. Like the light in them had dimmed.

""Everything alright, love?"" I asked, a knot forming in my stomach.

""Perfectly fine, Liam,"" she said, her voice a little too even, a little too saccharine. ""Just thinking.""

But what was she thinking about? She never elaborated. She used to share everything with me. Every thought, every worry, every silly dream. Now, there was a wall. An invisible, impenetrable barrier.

Her habits shifted too. She stopped reading her paperback novels, something she used to do every night. Instead, she’d sit in the living room, often in the dark, just staring at the television, which wasn't even on. I’d walk in, and she’d jump, startled, then offer that same unnerving, flat smile.

""Just resting my eyes,"" she'd say. ""Long day.""

But her days weren't long. She didn't work. She was supposed to be designing our new garden layout, filling her time with things she loved. But the garden remained untouched, slowly becoming overgrown.

The smell intensified. That earthy, sickly sweet scent, a mix of damp soil and something else… something organic and decaying. It clung to Sarah. I’d try to hold her close, to smell her familiar scent – her shampoo, her perfume, her unique skin musk – but it was always there, underneath it all, that terrible, cloying odor. It made my stomach churn.

""Are you feeling okay, Sarah?"" I asked one evening, trying to sound casual as she sat across from me at dinner, barely touching her food.

She looked up, her spoon halfway to her mouth. Her eyes were wide, unblinking. ""Why, Liam? Do I not look okay?""

Her tone was unsettling. Defensive, almost aggressive. And for a moment, just a flicker, her face seemed to contort. The muscles in her jaw tightened, her lips pulled back too far, revealing a flash of teeth that seemed too long, too pointed. Then it was gone, replaced by a perfect, bland expression.

""You just seem a little… quiet,"" I stammered, my heart thumping against my ribs.

""People change, Liam. Don't they?"" she said, and then she went back to pushing the food around on her plate.

I couldn’t eat. My appetite had vanished days ago. I started losing weight. Sleeping became a luxury I couldn't afford, perpetually on edge, listening to the house, listening to Sarah. I found myself watching her, scrutinizing every move, every blink, every breath. And the more I watched, the more I saw.

The way her fingers would sometimes clench, almost convulsively, when she thought I wasn't looking. The subtle, almost imperceptible tremor in her right hand as she held her coffee cup. The way her eyes would occasionally drift, focusing on something far beyond the walls, a look of chilling vacancy replacing the familiar warmth.

And then, I found it. In the utility closet, tucked behind some old paint cans. A small, dark, viscous puddle. It smelled of that same sickly-sweet earth, but stronger, more pungent. I touched it with my finger. It was thick, gelatinous, and left a faint, disturbing stickiness. I wiped my finger on an old rag, but the smell clung to me. I scrubbed my hand raw, but I could still feel it, deep under my skin.

I tried to talk to her about it. ""Sarah,"" I said, holding the rag, ""what is this?""

She barely glanced up from the blank TV screen. ""What's what, Liam?""

""This,"" I insisted, bringing the rag closer. ""This… goo. From the closet.""

She finally turned, her stare unnervingly direct. Her lips curved into that thin, unsettling smile. ""Oh, that. Just a bit of damp, I suppose. The pipes are old.""

""It's not damp, Sarah. It feels… organic.""

Her smile widened, her eyes fixed on mine. ""Organic? Silly, Liam. It's just water. Or maybe… maybe something from the garden, tracking in.""

But she hadn't been in the garden in weeks. Never mind the garden. She hadn't been herself in weeks.

My mind raced. Was she sick? Was it a breakdown? But the way she looked at me… it wasn't Sarah. It was something else. Something pretending to be her.

New Leaf was my very first Animal Crossing game, and I began playing it at 10 years old. The game holds so much nostalgia for me and is filled to the brim with good memories. I hold it so dear because, for me, finding anything with good memories attached is a bit of a struggle. New Leaf is one of the few things I have that I associate with only good things. Thinking of it makes me emotional, even just hearing the music for 7 PM makes me want to cry. From happiness over the joy the game brought me, or from sadness over missing those days, I am unsure, but the game stire up plenty of feelings for me.

I wish I had the same attachment to the villagers in New Horizons that I did in New Leaf. Little 10 year old me loved talking to the villagers, thinking up stories for each one, making headcanons for them and their relationships with each other. I still remember my first 5 starting villagers; Flora, Hopper, Iggly (who I was convinced had a crush on my character), Purrl and Nan. Then came the new ones like Kyle, Anchovy, Phoebe, Knox and ... Bianca. I never liked Bianca because the way she talked with and about Iggly made me think she wanted to take him from me, so I absolutely hated her. I wanted her to move out, but Iggly was the first starters to move out and it happened before she did. I will always hold that grudge against her LMAO.

The music of that game makes me so nostalgic, the hourly music bring tears to my eyes, listening to K.K. Flamenco makes me feel butterflies. 5 PM and 7 PM are my favorites, and 12 AM and later give me the same feelings because I remember staying up late playing on my 3DS when I should have been asleep, just so I can hunt for bugs to sell.

I remember being ecstatic when I finally opened the Roost. Mind you, I never looked up a guide for anything. I did it all at my own pace, so it took me a bit to reach certain points. After a half a year or so, (i was grounded for a month also so take that into account to), I had finally opened the Roost and being able to drink coffee there and serve it to villagers was so much fun. I made it a part of my daily in-game routine, to make sure I always visit Brewster and help him out while getting something to drink for myself.

I remember bringing fruit to Dr. Shrunk every day to unlock new emotes. I remember the insane laugh I had when I saw the Shrunk Funk Shuffle for the first time. I remember visiting the club every night, and being excited for Saturdays when KK would play his guitar. 

I still remember how my old town tune went. What I was trying to do with it the first time was re-create a bit from the MLP fansong ""Flutterwonder"" but it sounded... Bad. But I mistakenly saved it as my town tune rather than exiting out, but I'm happy I did that because it was my tune for years, and hearing it makes my heart melt. 

The only things I regret are my name and town name. Because first of all, I didn't know I couldn't change my name, and when my dad was setting it up with me, I told him to make my name an irl nickname my parents call me (it's ""Booboo"" because that was the sound I made as a baby). My town name isn't so bad, it's just a stupid non-sense name ""Kwee"" because I thought it was funny and sounded cute. But those are the only things that bother me, though they're embarrassing, they're not enough to ruin the game for me which I'm grateful for. I have severe anxiety, my very existence emnarrasses me, so to have something full of good memories that doesn't embarrass me so much or make me feel ill thinking about? I'm so thankful for it.

I was excited for New Horizons, but now that I'm so much older, it makes me a bit sad to say that I fell out of it pretty fast. It was so fun for a while, and it was even more fun when the HHP DLC was released, but I'm so sad that it was such a let down and how it was abandoned so fast. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice game and I don't regret buying it, but it will never hold a candle to New Leaf, but maybe that's just me being biased.",1,1753921582.0,AnimalCrossing,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

When evaluating wooden compost bins, several features stand out as particularly important. These include the type of wood used, the bin's capacity, the presence of ventilation, and the ease of access for both adding materials and harvesting compost.

**Wood Type:** The type of wood used in a compost bin's construction greatly influences its durability and resistance to decay. Cedar, redwood, and pressure-treated wood are all popular choices due to their natural resistance to moisture and insects. Cedar is a particularly good option, as it contains natural oils that act as preservatives, extending the life of the bin.

**Capacity:** Compost bin capacity is typically measured in cubic feet. The ideal size depends on the amount of organic waste you generate and the available space in your yard. Smaller bins, around 10-15 cubic feet, are suitable for individuals or small families, while larger bins, exceeding 30 cubic feet, are better for larger households or those with extensive gardens.

**Ventilation:** Proper ventilation is crucial for aerobic composting,the process by which microorganisms break down organic matter in the presence of oxygen. Ventilation holes or slats allow air to circulate within the bin, preventing anaerobic conditions that can lead to foul odors and slow decomposition.**Accessibility:** A well-designed compost bin should offer easy access for both adding new materials and harvesting finished compost. some bins feature removable panels or doors at the base, allowing you to collect compost without disturbing the entire pile.Top-loading bins should have hinged lids that open wide for convenient filling.

## Core benefits

Investing in a wooden compost bin offers several meaningful benefits,improving both the composting process and the overall aesthetics of your garden. these benefits range from promoting faster decomposition to providing a more attractive alternative to plastic composters.

**Faster Decomposition:** Wooden compost bins, especially those with good ventilation, can significantly accelerate the decomposition process compared to open piles or poorly ventilated containers. The enclosed habitat helps retain heat, creating optimal conditions for microbial activity. This leads to finished compost in a shorter amount of time.**Improved Aesthetics:** Unlike plastic compost bins, wooden bins blend seamlessly into natural garden settings. They can be stained or painted to match existing landscaping,adding a touch of rustic charm to your outdoor space. This makes composting a more visually appealing and integrated part of your garden.

**Reduced Odor:** Properly managed wooden compost bins tend to produce less odor than open compost piles. The enclosed structure helps contain smells, preventing them from becoming a nuisance to you or your neighbors. adequate ventilation further minimizes odor by promoting aerobic decomposition.

**Environmental Friendliness:** Using a compost bin reduces the amount of organic waste sent to landfills, lowering methane emissions and conserving valuable landfill space. By creating your own compost, you also reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and other synthetic soil amendments, promoting a more sustainable gardening practice.

## Key Features Analysis

The Hamilton beach electric tea kettles boast several features designed for convenience, safety, and performance.These features collectively contribute to an enhanced user experience and reliable operation.

**Fast Boiling:** Most Hamilton Beach electric tea kettles are engineered for rapid heating, bringing water to a boil much faster than traditional stovetop methods.This capability is typically achieved through a powerful heating element strategically positioned within the kettle. Users can expect boiling times to range from just a few minutes, depending on the model and the amount of water. This fast boiling feature is especially beneficial for busy individuals or households where hot beverages are frequently consumed.

**Automatic Shutoff and Boil-Dry Protection:** Safety is a paramount concern, and Hamilton Beach incorporates automatic shutoff and boil-dry protection into its electric tea kettles.

The automatic shutoff function ensures that the kettle turns off automatically once the water has reached a boiling point.

These safety measures provide peace of mind during operation.

**Cordless Design with 360-degree Base:** Hamilton Beach electric tea kettles typically feature a cordless design that allows for easy filling and pouring.

The kettle sits on a 360-degree swivel base,enabling users to conveniently lift and place it from any direction. This design enhances maneuverability and simplifies the filling and pouring process, making it more user-friendly and convenient. The cordless operation also promotes easier cleaning and storage.**Concealed Heating Element:** The concealed heating element is a common feature in Hamilton Beach electric tea kettles, promoting durability and ease of cleaning.

This design protects the heating element from direct contact with water, which reduces mineral buildup and simplifies the cleaning process. By preventing mineral deposits from accumulating on the heating element, the kettle's efficiency and longevity are enhanced. The sealed design also contributes to improved safety.

**Water Level Indicator:** Many Hamilton beach models are equipped with a water level indicator, allowing users to precisely fill the kettle based on their needs.

This feature eliminates the guesswork involved in measuring water and helps prevent overfilling or underfilling, which can affect the boiling time and overall performance of the kettle.

1mdn1ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1mdn1ji/advice_needed_to_be_a_better_adult_and_roommate/,Advice needed to be a better adult and roommate,"Hi, Reddit, I’m posting here because I want to be better at adulting, and by proxy, be a better roommate.

Before I say anything, a bit of context about myself, I (26) grew up in a messy and chaotic household, so I’m acclimated to mess more than the average person, and as an adult, I struggle with executive dysfunction and ADHD. I moved out at 21 because my living situation got too terrible to handle, and I thought I would be much better at adulting by now, but I’m struggling. This doesn’t excuse my “crimes,” haha, but I hope explains where I’m coming from.

My roommate (29) and I have had our fair share of tiffs in the past; he’s a pretty clean and methodical person, and doesn’t own much. I’ve gotten better at doing certain things to his standards to minimize conflict, like washing dishes immediately after cooking rather than waiting until later.

But there are some other things I want to get better at, and it’s like my brain fights me on anything that involves being an adult.

Around the house, I’m really struggling with tidiness. Specifically clutter. I don’t leave trash around, but I have a bad habit of leaving behind my books, notebooks, cords, etc. in communal spaces like on the coffee table or dining table. And, frustratingly, if it gets moved into my room, it just becomes clutter in there, until I rally myself to clean up once a month.

I am taking medications, but I’m currently stuck in a feedback loop where I forget to take my meds, which causes me to become more depressed/dysfunctional, and makes me forget to take my meds more.

I’m want badly to be a better roommate and adult. How do I combat this “clutter blindness” and executive dysfunction? I’ve tried every tip in the book: setting timers, writing reminders, having organizer bins, etc., and it all makes me want to pull my hair out or outright doesn’t work. (Don’t underestimate my ability to ignore a phone alarm, despite my best efforts.)

Please be kind, help and advice appreciated from others who struggled with this.

Tonight I was tired and had done shipt deliveries earlier in the day so I didn’t feel like going back out. I needed some things from target and figured I’d do a shipt order for myself.

It was a medium size order (18 items), nothing too complicated - a few Alani drinks, chicken strips, onion rings, spinach, butter, drink mix, strawberries, iced coffee, and a skincare product. The order got taken pretty fast because I saw it pop up on my shopper app and then quickly disappeared. I thought ok, great. The delivery window was 7-8 pm.

So it’s getting near 7 pm and I haven’t gotten any of the automated “your shopper is en route” or “your shopper will shop soon” messages. Kinda weird but whatever. A little while goes by, so I check the target app and under my orders it says the shopper is shopping. I think that’s strange because again I still haven’t gotten any of the texts updating me on my order. More time goes by and now the app says my order is shopped. Then I get the “your shopper has finished shopping” message. Weird…

That text came along with the link where I can see where the shopper is and what he got. I see that there’s 2 items “not found”. But I had specifically chosen substitutes for these items. I thought that was kinda annoying because what’s the point of picking the subs if the shopper isn’t gonna use them? I figured I was making it easier for the guy, knowing how frustrating it can be when something is out of stock.

Eventually he comes and delivers my bags so I go downstairs to get them. As soon as I walk back in my apartment I get a flood of texts - all delivered at 742 pm, a few minutes after the delivery. He sent the intro text, then a few more messages asking me to confirm he was in the right location. I put detailed notes about my apartment in the notes section because again, I know how annoying it can be when someone lives in a confusing apartment. I was very explicit about where it is and what to leave.

I feel bad because I know how low ratings affect us and how things can go with this job, but I feel like I made things very easy for him and my order was kinda half assed. He didn’t communicate w me at all, buy the subs I chose or read my notes about the apartment. What would you rate this guy? I tipped 15% but I just feel like being a shopper myself, I never would’ve done any of that stuff lol ",1,1753920818.0,ShiptShoppers,2,1.0,False

I’m a 35-year-old nerdy guy from New England, big into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site that made it on the news. (Yes, seriously.)

I’ve been fortunate to find community through cosplay—whether I’m suited up as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil—and even got featured on the news a couple times for it. I work out, dress sharp, and have a bizarre talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes.

Now for the honest bit: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want love, but because timing, shyness, and life just never lined up. But I’ve grown a lot—and I’m ready to meet someone for something real. If you’re nerdy, kind, curious, and value connection over perfection, we might vibe well.

Cosplay’s totally optional—what matters more is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where it leads. If you’re nearby, a casual coffee would be a great way to start.

1mdmxq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftRecommendations/comments/1mdmxq8/what_are_the_unique_questions_about_the_groom_for/,What are the Unique Questions about the Groom for Bridal Shower?,"Planning a bridal shower game that includes questions about the groom? Many people on Reddit have shared creative and personal ideas that are perfect for games like “How Well Does the Bride Know the Groom” or “He Said, She Said.” Whether you want something funny, meaningful, or number-based, here’s a helpful list of questions others have used—and loved.

# Groom-Related Questions for Bridal Shower Games

**Best for:** Games where the bride answers questions about the groom, or guests guess the bride’s answers.

# Light and Fun Questions

These are great if you want to keep things easygoing and fun:

* What’s his dream vacation spot?  
* What food could he eat every day without getting tired of it?  
* What would he do first if he won the lottery?  
* What did he wear on your first date?  
* What’s his go-to comfort TV show or movie?  

These kinds of questions help keep the mood relaxed and get everyone laughing.

# Sweet and Personal Questions

If you're looking for more emotional or heartfelt moments, try these:

* Who said “I love you” first?  
* What does he admire most about the bride?  
* What’s one thing the bride does that always makes him smile?  
* What’s his favorite meal that the bride cooks?  
* What’s his idea of a perfect Sunday?  

These work especially well if you’re putting together a memory book or video.

# Number-Based Questions

If you're playing a game where guests have to guess a number, these questions are perfect:

* How many pets has he had?  
* At what age did he move out of his parents' house?  
* How many cups of coffee does he drink each day?  
* How many countries has he been to?  
* How long does he take to get ready?  

A number-based format adds a fun guessing element and is great for scoring.

# Game Show Style Questions

Some users suggested drawing inspiration from the “Newlywed Game” or similar shows:

* Who’s more likely to fall asleep during a movie?  
* Who’s more organized?  
* Who shops online more often?  
* Who takes longer to get ready?  
* Who’s more likely to cry during a movie?  

These types of questions are fun for everyone to answer or guess, and they tend to bring out a lot of laughter from the group.

# Memory Book or Letter Prompts

If you’re creating a keepsake for the bride, consider including questions that bring out personal stories:

* When did you know you and the bride would be friends for life?  
* What’s your favorite memory with the bride?  
* What do you admire most about her?  
* Tell a story that always makes you laugh when you think about her.  
* What’s one wish you have for the bride and groom?  

These are perfect for a bridal shower scrapbook or a group gift filled with notes from loved ones.

# Tips from Other Redditors

* Make sure the bride is comfortable answering in front of everyone.  
* Mix funny and heartfelt questions to keep the event balanced.  
* Keep the group in mind—some guests may prefer lighter questions.  
* You don’t need too many—10 to 15 good ones are enough to keep things fun.  

**In Short:** Bridal shower games that focus on the groom are a great way to include him in the celebration, even if he’s not there. Whether you're aiming for laughter, sweet moments, or a little bit of both, these question ideas can help you create a fun and memorable shower for the bride.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

🛌 Safe, clean, comfortable (no bed bugs—ever 😅) I cannot sleep with hard pillows. 😫

😍 Pretty. The area, the architecture, the view. I cannot look at industrial day and night. 

🚗 Good parking or easy rideshare access

📍 Ideally close to Canal Blvd/the Richmond Channel or nearby public transit

Reliable for a solo work traveler 👧

Bonus if within walking distance of coffee shops, local bookstores, or cute neighborhoods

Extra brownie points if there's a rooftop bar, pool, or evening lounge


I’ve been eyeing the Berkeley City Club Hotel—looks beautiful, historic, cozy—but I'm not totally sure about its proximity to Canal Blvd/Richmond Channel area. Can anyone weigh in on location logistics, transport options (Uber easy? Need rental car?), or recommend a similarly safe, well-rated place that fits my vibe?

, I arrived here couple months ago .. 

I do go to artcaffee usually to get my coffee cuz hey ! 
It’s one of the most popular coffee here .. 
and since I’m use to take my coffee late “ Middle East style “ and since the only coffee around my area open 24hours its “ artcaffee Westland market “ I go there most of the time .. 

All the stuff was nice to me except this one tall guy who deliver the coffees to the cars who park outside .. “ they have this service to “ 

So I noticed that couple times , like when I ask him anything he just looks at me weirdly and just go without any reason ! 
I don’t care that much so I just talk to other stuff and move on .. 

And since I don’t engage with him at all I don’t even know his name and I don’t care .. when I wanna coffee I just go straight to the barrister  order , take my coffee , finch my things and go home .. 

Today was the same , at lest in the beginning .. 

I took the coffee , I set outside finishing some paperwork .. 
that weird tall crazy guy comes up to me saying “ I wanna take this table “ 
I was sitting in that big sitting area with two tables “ the only one available at that time “ 
And there is some chairs .. 
he took my stuff put it in the other table and took the table aggressively ! 
I was sitting in the middle of them and my legs resting in the end of the second table “ the table he took “  so when he was taking it aggressively that crazy hurt my leg and stormed out .. 
that literally happened in in less than 30 seconds I couldn’t even understand what the fuck is going on  ! “ 
Aren’t he supposed to ask if I need the other table ! 
Maybe there is more of my friends coming ! 
At-lest ask me to move my things myself ! 😂 
Nah , that crazy didn’t do any of that .. 

Just took it and go .. 
I was like let me give the The benefit of the doubt .. maybe someone need it .. 
so I let it go .. even tho my legs really hurt me ! 

So when he pass my again I asked him if he can push the table ii have left to the wall so it we’ll look better,, since he took the one that close to the wall .. 

That crazy look at me up and down ,, and go 🤡😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡
Nat even joking .. I was like nah .. u can’t be rude and disrespectful and ignore costumers in the Same time .. so I sow his manager “ dav” and told him what happened and told dave to ask him why he act like that ! .. 
he apologised and said I’ll talk to him .. 
I said “ alght “ 

When I was about to leave I talked to dav again asking him “ okay what did he say ! “ 
He was like “ nothing much but he’s sorry “ 
I was like “ we’ll I wanna hear that from him and I wanna really know why that crazy hate me for ! “ 

He called him “ I said I wanna ask u two questions! Why do u hate me for , did I do something wrong to u ! “ 

That crazy literally looked at me saying I don’t wanna talk to u ‘ 
I said “ why did I do anything to u ! “ 
He again act crazy and be like dont want to talk to u 
So I said “ we’ll I’m sure where not gonna talk to each other again for sure but why u being straight disrespectful u can not do that ! , this is unacceptable ! “ I said that out loud 
That crazy point his finger up and said “ 👆take ur stuff and go home “ and look at dav saying talk to her ! “ talking about me “ 
When I tell u after that , that crazy dog walk and go I’m not even laying 🤡😂😂😂😂😂 

So I yelled at him “ if u can’t be respectful go home crazy ass weirdo “ the manager again apologised and wished a good night to me 
and I left to home after that .. 


So right know what the right thing to do ! 
Is all ppl like that here or just this weirdo ass crazy ! 
and what i suppose to do in this kinda of action ! 
Cuz the manger literally stand between us and do  nothing .. 🤡 

The whole situation so fucking weird .. and the manger behaviour and the stuff was more weirder ..

**The results are in for Match 4. The winner is…**

Cheers resounded from kids and drunk partiers alike as the dock, already inundated with noise pollution from its current residents, was thrown into a frenzy by the two new pizza boys on the block. Visible from above was Azumi Ryuzaki, the kid who somehow managed to find a way to grind on a plastic life ring. Every kick of the ball was a chance to show off his skill, a chance to prove himself even more. He could feel his strength winding up with every rush forward. And now, it’s time for the final push.

⌈Fishbone⌋ leaped its way out of the ball, dragging two boats with it. A flawless angle for grinding. He’d put everything in place for one final grind.

“I hope you’re watching, jackass! You might think fancy flourish can cut it, but I’ll show you what *real* style looks like!” Azumi declares boldly at his competitor as he slides along the boats he reeled in, lined up to land right onto his final target. An ‘everyman’ knows how to flourish, but never at the cost of ‘passion.’

But from below, a more subtle type of flourish lurked. Right as Azumi made his move… so too did the stylish professional making the rounds, Nate Altamuria. While the soccer star was keeping eyes on himself, Nate had seemingly slipped away from the unruly customer he had firmly handled. Sliding along the seafloor, his own life ring in hand, he is as quiet as a shadow… determined to make as little disturbance as possible. After all, professionals are devoted to their ‘job’ above all else.

“Nate Altamuria, requesting permission to board for delivery of pizza!” Taking formal procedure, Nate boards, with smooth panache. Once more, just as before, he unveiled his pizzas from his cloth. The only sounds he needed to hear were the claps and thankful applause of his clients. And just as he makes his delivery, he eyes down his competition with a smug glower.

“All I see is a neighborhood disturbance kicking around and tugging boats without customer consent! You really think you can qualify as a pizza courier with moves like *that*?”

Azumi, sticking the landing and handing over his last pizza, glares right back. “Oh? Why don’t we ask…”

At that, both of the deliverers dash off their customers’ boats, Nate coasting his way down the seabed and Azumi surfing the rails of the boats that were now sporadically laid out around the marina. In no time at all, they managed to cross the entire harbor and land squarely in front of their “client,” still sitting in silent agony.

“You saw me out there, right? Obviously, I did better than this stuck-up!” Azumi butts in first, jabbing a finger at Nate.

Nate claps back with no hesitation. “Really? I can’t believe you think that display anywhere approached mine!” He turns towards the pizza boy, his earlier fury returning to his face.

“So who is it? Spit it out!”

“Wha-!? I-I, um…” the pizza boy sputtered nervously - he was regretting being anywhere near these psychos at this point. Hesitantly, he cleared his throat. “W-well, I-I didn’t have the best vantage point from, uh, over here, but… a-as far as I can tell, th-the winner… was…”

“HAH! That’s what I thought!” Nate immediately blurts out in Azumi’s face. “You were a fucking moron for even thinking you stood a chance..!” This time, however, he catches his broken composure, and simply turns to the clientele.

“Glad to have been of service, sir.”

The pizza boy nods and fumbles around in his pockets for a moment while mumbling. “Uh, right, yeah… uh, since you helped out, I guess I can give you today’s tip…” He hurriedly pulls his hand out of his pocket	 and produced the tip: a spherical blue stone. Nate and Azumi both speak at the same time.

“A-an Uropeh?!”

Without hesitation, Nate immediately snatches it out of the pizza boy’s hand and stuffs it in his own pocket, away from Azumi. “Where did you even get that? You said it came as a tip?”

The pizza boy stuttered, clearly not prepared for this reaction. “Y-yeah, there was some rich house that wanted this huge stack of pizza, and they gave me this thing for the trouble instead of cash… is it, like, valuable or something?”

Nate laughs in reply. “Oh, you bet it is! Thanks for the tip bye!” Before the conversation could continue, Nate slipped into 2D space with his Stand, gliding away from the scene. The pizza boy looks back to Azumi, who looks to be completely frozen in fury.

“Eh, sorry kid, I don’t have any more of those. Thanks for the help earlier, though…”

Azumi exhales a large breath through his nose and turns around, walking away. “I don’t think I’m in the mood for pizza anymore…”

**Scenario: Christiansted, Saint Croix — 2:17pm**

Canopies.

Strolling through the streets of Christiansted one bears witness to the complete and absolute domination that the canopy has over its walkways. Built outward from the facades of its myriad buildings and so well integrated into their architecture it is as though they’d grown organically they cast its walkways in a pervasive shade, sheltering pedestrians from the heat of clear skies and a sweltering sun. They make simple additions to the identity of St. Croix’s largest town, lacking entirely in the aesthetics of modern design. Chipped painting and aged construction materials lovingly maintained across the years intermingle with more recent refurbishment - testament to history present even in the simplest wrought iron gate shuttering off a vacant alley.

Founded by Captain Frederik Moth in 1733 and named after King Christian VI of Denmark the former capital of the Danish West Indies’ colonial history is as unavoidable as those very shadows. Its architecture incorporates both Danish-style pastels and the aesthetics of its myriad slave laborers; every brick and stone echoing that shared past. The sands of time flow on and with it comes the flow of foot-traffic, and as lives etch their way across its streets new sights and sounds spring left and right. Venues and vendors, storefronts with signs jutting from their building facades vying to catch the eye, tourists and locals, children and old. For all the walks of life that stroll across those cobbled stones the shade casts itself across their backs as cool winds glide through the arches of towering canopies, soothing the sweat on their necks and making the walk just a little more bearable. It is easy to forget them for the more iconic boardwalk, but the canopies are there - watching as they always have.

They are not the only ones, either.

One can say many things of Operation: Midnight Runners, the band of bastards and plunderers which certain factions within Speedwagon Foundation in their infinite wisdom had tasked to the Caribbean. They weren’t trustworthy, and though abso-fucking-lutely effective it remained to be seen if they could serve as reliable assets. One thing, however, was certain. They knew how to enjoy themselves on company time - and that is how we find two of their ranks, unremarkable faces in crowds of yet even more, but the savvy eye, the discerning eye, they’ll tell you there’s no such thing as ‘unremarkable’. They’d be right to.

“Oooh…”

Charlotte Chastain had had her face practically pressed up against the glass of a jewelry store, eyeing a particularly sizable display piece. Her focus was broken, however, by the snide chucking of a man next to her.

“Heh… that thing? Wouldn’t you prefer, y’know, a challenge?” Century teased, eyeing the gem. “Prolly not even worth that much…”

“Petit con…” Charlotte muttered under her breath, looking at Century with a deeply unamused look on her face. “Is this all you can think about? I have *tastes* you know.”

 “Could’ve fooled me…” Century said with a chuckle. 

“Why YES, I COULD have! ANYONE could because you-”

“I leave you two alone for two minutes… stop it.” A stern voice called out, cutting Charlotte’s rebuttal short.

Yoshi Tsubasa approached the two from behind. Though his face was shrouded in a white poncho, the disappointment in his eyes was clearly visible.

“C’mon, we’re here on a job. Let’s stop gawking and get back to work.”

Century let out a deep, annoyed, *prolonged* sigh. “Right, right, I forgot. No fun allowed when birdbrain’s around~! What were *you* doing, anyway?”

Yoshi looked to the side, not dignifying Century’s teasing with a response. “What we *came here* for. The LKA Leviathan was spotted in the area and the Foundation’s getting antsy. We need to gather eyewitness accounts and establish a watch in the area.”

Century’s brow furrowed as the purpose of their outing drifted into conversation once more. Though he didn’t pay attention to their briefings often he knew to keep his nose to the scent of risk, and that ‘Leviathan’ smacked of nothing but. Just skimming over the dossier of the Leviathan had been enough to bring bile to the pit of his throat, the records of its prior inhabitants and what little they knew of the current painting a stark picture of the exact kind of heat he could do little without. You don’t run into crazed serial killers burglaring houses! Luckily… you don’t burglar houses with a crack team of stand users either. He didn’t *have* to work on his own anymore. Yoshi could be the diligent little poster child of their outfit all they wanted - if it meant a walking talking crow-man was in between him and some Jigsaw obsessed freak all the better.

He wasn’t here for the hard jobs.

“Yeah yeah… *captain*, just puff up those feathers real nice and lead the way.” 

Charlotte chuckled. “As though we *need* a leader.”

With a grave sigh Yoshi retorted with a simple beckoning gesture as they took the lead, resolving it would be best to survey the area as a group as opposed to their original plans to split up. The three began walking down the street, making their way to the coast just a bit down the road. Not long into their walk, they encountered a small crowd forming, gathering in a circle. Yoshi held an arm out, halting the group.

“Hold on… some kind of commotion. Might be LKA…?”

Charlotte shook her head. “Non. C’est *Moko Jumbie*.”

Squinting to look a bit further, Yoshi squinted. He saw the crowd was smiling, and a dancer in stilts stood above the crowd. “Ah… so it is.” 

Century crossed his arms as they continued walking. “How did *you* know *that*?”

Charlotte smiled, giving him the side-eye. “Unlike you, I have been here before~”

“*Focus*.” Yoshi growled. “We don’t have to… waste…” His words trailed off, looking back in the direction of the Moko Jumbie. That dance of hers seemed… off. The way she moved, jumped and swayed on those stilts… it was almost as though she was floating through the air.

No… not ‘as though’. It was faint, barely noticeable to the untrained eye, but a subtle pink glow enveloped the performer.

“...on second thought, maybe we *should* watch.” Yoshi nodded, pulling the other two closer (to Century’s further annoyance). “If she’s a user, she might have useful information.”

“Ah, hi there!” seeing the trio approach, the Moko Jumbie turned, flashing a smile in their direction. “Enjoyed the performance, I hope?”

To those who hadn’t seen a Moko Jumbie before, the woman standing before them was a breathtaking sight. Despite towering over them, the colorful, loose-fitting clothes she wore gave her an air of friendly approachability. She reached up, letting her hat hang back from the drawstring and pulling off her multicolored sunglasses, revealing her vibrant eyes and twin-tailed hair - though a layer of white makeup still masked much of her face.

“Ah- Tres magnifique! Oh, where are my manners! My name is Charlotte, what is yours my beauty~?”

“Michelle!” She replied, crouching down and offering a hand to shake, which Charlotte took gently. “Michelle Williams. Though, most folks just call me ‘Dancer’, can’t *imagine* why - nice to meet you!” 

“Pardon our interruption, Ms. Williams.” Yoshi interjected. “Pleasant though conversation would be, we’re here on business.”

“That so?” Dancer hummed, standing back up straight. “Not sure what business folks like you would have with a humble street performer like myself, but I’ll bite! Whatcha need from little ol’ me~?

“Would you mind if I asked you a few questions? We’re looking for information about some… incidents, that have been going on in the area.”

“...oh?” she paused, a slight look of concern coming over her face. “I… hadn’t heard about any incidents in this area. Nothing too serious, I hope …should I be worried?”

Century looked bored, grimacing and tapping his foot impatiently. Was *this* seriously how they were going to be going out doing this? Just going up to random people on the street and hoping they’d run into someone who had something useful to say? It was bad enough getting press ganged into this whole “Midnight Runners” operation, but recruiting him just to force him to spend hours on mindnumbing grunt work? That really pissed him off.

Yoshi paused. “You needn’t worry yourself. We’d simply like to know if the words ‘LKA Leviathan’ mean anything to you.” Dancer didn’t respond immediately, wearing the same concerned expression on her face for a moment… though interestingly, her shoulders did seem to relax somewhat as she finally spoke up.

“Leviathan…? Nope, sorry. Never heard of it,” she said, shaking her head. “But hey, if I happen to hear anything, I could let you—” Dancer began helpfully before being cut off by an increasingly irritated Century.

“Cool, great, she doesn’t know anything.” Century rolled his eyes. “Can we go now, or do we need to make friends with every damn busker we run into just to waste as much of my time as possible?”

“And of course, it would not do to waste any of your *oh so valuable* time, would it?” Charlotte replied snarkily. In doing so, she glanced past him, a smirk gracing her face. “Ah, au fait - you might want to check your wallet.”

“My…?” Century muttered, his hand instinctively moving to his back pocket - to be met with naught but denim. He paused. Frantically, Century’s hands dove from back to chest to inner jacket, scouring every pocket lining his person… to no avail. Spinning around, he followed Charlotte’s gaze - whereupon he found himself looking at a seagull, head tilted slightly to the side… clutching his wallet in its beak.

Before Century could even process the sight, the Seagull took off, flying off towards the coastline with Century’s wallet in tow.

Century quickly turned out his pockets, not quite believing it to be true. He grit his teeth, cursing under his breath. “WHA- HOW?! The pocket is still zipped up! I-” 

He looked up, brow furrowed. Thrusting his arm forward, a gangly figure emerged from behind him, soaring through the air towards the seagull.

**｢PLAY IT SAFE!｣**


The figure slashed wildly through the air at the seagull, but the bird seemed to outspeed it, quickly putting distance between the Stand and itself. As it reached the edge of the range, the Stand let out a screech, smashing the ground as Century grunted.

Yoshi looked around, the non-Stand using passerby quickly getting confused. He put a hand on Century’s shoulder “Hey- maybe take your own advice. Don’t be reckless here, we’re in public-!”

“FUCK that! Damn thing got my wallet!” he said, jerking his shoulder away. He took off sprinting towards the coastline, chasing after the bird.

“Hehehe~ Make sure you do not lose anything else!” Charlotte yelled, waving off Century.

“FUCK YOU TOO!!” Century screamed as he faded into the distance.

Yoshi shook his head, turning to Charlotte. “Well, maybe now we can finally get some work done. Strange, though… When Century summoned ｢Play It Safe｣, that Dancer didn’t react at all… hm. Could’ve *sworn* that was a Stand effect…”

---

In another part of town, however, the liveliness has begun to slow. Activity shifts away from this side of the island as a faint mist has begun to set in. While few know its name, far more recognize the near-mythological presence it has established for itself in no time at all.

The LKA Leviathan has surfaced in St. Croix. And disembarking from the cargo of death…

“Finally, a chance to get off that thing… I swear, it's nothing but open sea or business with this crew.” The “Eyes” of LKA, Chicxulub Tunguska, steps onto the pier. Beside him walked a more overwhelming presence, the “Skin,” Regular People.

Ever the conversationalist, the Skin of the Leviathan is the first to respond.

“Tut…tut… my friend, I pity your clarity,” the behemoth known as Regular People’s voice chimed a dulcet mixture of compassion and matter-of-factness which scratched with a sing-song melody, “The business is eternal. It echoes our every step, for we are the **‘fractaling’** of the Leviathan.” He leans back with a grandiose smile, arms spread to embrace a cool breeze as it glides through his soft, mushy fingertips, “You… You should be happy. The work is the break. The break is the work. That is the way of things.”

“Ahhh… so we’re friends?” Chicxulub drawled lackadaisically, hands slung in his pockets as his gaze skimmed across a few market stalls, quietly wondering to himself what trinkets he ought to buy, “Take it from me then, *you* need a better work life balance.”

Regular People chortled boisterously, “Hah! Hahaha! But I am just a Regular Man!”

As they bantered a third in their group followed closely behind Regular People - the less flatteringly-named “bowels,” Baygon Raid. Despite easily being the second tallest of the three present, their spindly form quietly tucked itself behind Regular People’s towering form, keeping their wiry frame hunched and unassuming. As the group moved its head twitched repeatedly while it looked around at the dock and surrounding beaches, eyes filled with curiosity. Though they could not bring themselves to look at their fellow peers they listened intently all the same to their words, quiet fascination at their banter calling to them with a yearning just as vivid as their mosquito instinct’s call to CO2. 

After a brief moment of silence, Chix continued.

“Welp, if you’re regular I’ve no idea what I am. Guess that’d make me a slacker?” He cracked a grin, “As if. I’m just not in a rush to find our ‘purpose’ here. It’ll come to us eventually, right? No need to make unnecessary fuss when we can get a lay of the land and enjoy ourselves all the same. Better to get a view on the place and make a judgement call from there.”

Baygon could see Regular’s eye twitch and his fist clench, but through a kind smile and smoldering eyes he responded, “Judgement eludes the righteous man. The righteous man… advances, his eyes shrouded, in his blindness he surmounts all that can be seen.” A gentle hand extended, fingertips squishing against Chix’s shoulderblade as Regular People loomed over their conversational partner, “I could grant you freedom from that pesky clarity. Friend.” 

Baygon bobbed on their heels, those bright red eyes of theirs sparkling in awe! Were they… were they getting in a fight? Oh my god! What do they do? What do they say?! Should they involve themselves? What side should they pick! Regular People’s cryptic lines were just so cool and Chix’s laissez-faire made such a good juxtaposition to it! What could they even offer to the conversation? Ohh man think fast think fast think fas-

“...think I like my ‘clarity’ just fine.” A shadow cast upon Chix’s face starker than that cast from the canopy above, turning to for the first time in their conversation to meet Regular People’s gaze. The titan in turn gives a disgusting, pristine smile as they feel the burden of crushing darkness press upon their back. Chix speaks before they can comment on it, “-and you can call me *Chix*, Regular People. Now. Can you please let go of me. So we can focus on our job.” 

Regular merely stared forward with his signature permanent grin, no attempt made to move away from the man, his grip growing all the tighter with a serene stubbornness as though to egg that crushing dark on. As if it were not but an insect waiting to get crushed, fluid and bile bubbling from the seams of cracked exoskeleton. From behind the both of them Baygon’s excitement soured into a quiet, bubbling frustration.  For some reason, the whole thing was making it feel… annoyed. They weren’t letting them get an edge in! Why weren’t they able to *say* anything and why was it so easy for them to say things before she could? She was - they were - they were all coworkers or friends or some other special thing, right?! Why couldn’t the right words come out of her mouth then? Why weren’t they letting her say them? They were being so rude -gaahh! 

When they landed on this island she was looking forward to getting to hang out with them and go for *drinks* and do all the things that coworkers and friends and whatever-they-were-supposed-to-be were meant to do and she’d spent hours reading books and watching TV *just* for this occasion and now that they were here LOOK! LOOK! They were doing NONE of these things! NONE OF THEM!!! Why were they DOING THIS TO HER?! Why did they have to argue?! Why couldn’t they be normal?! She had to make them *normal*! She realized that was the issue! Nobody here was normal but her, but she could help them be normal too! She knew just the thing! She’d studied this on TV! Smiling enthusiastically, Baygon sprung between the two men, their antenna twitching as with a great big, beaming smile, they decided to blurt out that thing normal people always say when they want to hang out! 

“I think we should go ‘hang out’ at the boardwalk.” They paused, then remembered, you should *always* ask your friends what they want to do!  “-What do you guys think?”

It had certainly managed to stop the argument. Regular and Chix looked back at them, Chix’s eyebrow raised in subtle, crushing confusion whilst Regular’s kind veneer warped into an even kinder contempt. It took only a couple seconds of silence for Baygon to snap.

“...fine, I’ll go myself!... Assholes…” Baygon mutters as they slip past the two, speedwalking down the pier. 

Regular watches her off with a slight bit of disappointment. “It at least knows how to struggle. You could learn from its folly.”

Chix merely sighs. “Meh, her problems are hers to deal with.”

The boardwalk at Christiansted was a busy place, as expected of a tourist destination. That said, this town felt rather humble as far as tourist spots go- the walkspace wasn’t quite as filled out as somewhere like Nassau or Kingston, but people of all types walked the wavebound wooden streets bordering the city. The few high-rising hotels were almost overshadowed by the high quantity of smaller local establishments selling foods and trinkets.

This ‘hanging out’ was already starting to feel pretty sad. Baygon found themself walking along the boardwalk, surrounded by a crowd who seemed to pay them no mind (outside of a few passing glances). That brief moment of enthusiasm she managed for socialization had begun to dwindle; how are people supposed to get anywhere in a gathering if you can’t just ask..? Baygon sighs to herself at the thought, and instead decides to look around to where their walk brought them. The boardwalk is a nice little place, a wooden walkway directly next to the ocean. She found herself fixated on the sights she’d never seen before: rows upon rows of colorful buildings, small establishments selling unique foods, and even some bits of historical architecture hinting at the place’s age.

Eventually, it sat down on a nearby empty table, looking at all the people drifting by. They began to feel their fist clench as it rested on the table, and their mind was clouded by another wave of complex feelings. What was she even doing here in the first place..? This sham attempt at relaxation only served to remind her of what she was failing to accomplish. S.C. Johnson’s request had barely made any headway- it was impossible to say at this point whether that “gemstone city” even exists- and all she’s done is gotten herself hooked up with a bunch of other weirdos like her. Sure, some of them are pretty cool, but… just like these people on the boardwalk, they all live so *effortlessly*. Why can’t it be so easy for her? If only she could just flit about without a care in the-

Baygon’s long train of thought was quickly interrupted, however, when something flew into their face. Instinct kicked in as they immediately attempted to swat the intruder away, but it was too fast for her to catch, only managing to get a tiny lick onto her feathery assailant. …feathery?

Upon jumping up and stepping back, she finally got a glance at the flying beast: a rather distinct-looking seagull, now perched up on a neighboring table. Fists balled up, Baygon’s first thought was to let out their anger their favorite way and punish this thing properly… but after approaching it, she relented. It’s just a stupid seagull, after all. While the lust for violence subsided, her anger was still ever-present.

“What the hell is your problem, you lazy-ass bird? You think you can just run up on me like that? All your kind do is scavenge off all of us! I know you’re here for food! Why don’t you just go and get it the normal way instead of trying to bum off people…”

Baygon continued to angrily rant in an attempt to suppress its urge to strangle the bird violently, getting more than a few concerned looks this time. However, while most people attempted to keep their distance, one person in particular appeared with a running start.

“There you are, you damn seagull!”

Baygon turned their head to see another man, blond and dressed in all white, bursting onto the street with a huff, sweat dripping from his brow and his face seething with pent-up anger. As soon as Century turned the corner, the seagull’s distinct pattern caught his eye… followed soon by the only other person in this lot of tables.

Wait… that gangly-looking freak… wasn’t that one of the people they were looking for?

“You..! You’re that mosquito freak with the LKA! You… you used that bird to take my wallet, didn’t you?”

Baygon’s face scrunched up at the mention of LKA. Fully turning to address the man, Baygon stretched to its full height, its features unmistakable in the light of the sun. “What!? Why do you… I’ve never even *seen* this thing before - wait, who the hell are *you* supposed to be, anyways!?”

*“Caw!”*

Century snapped back, his patience clearly exhausted already. “You’re a damn liar! There ain’t a seagull out in the whole sea smart enough to steal cash off me, let *alone* of its own volition - besides, I’ve already pegged you for who you really are, so don’t even bother trying to hide it!”

***“Caw! Caw!”***

“What the hell are you even talking about!?” Baygon grit their teeth, ignoring the Seagull as it flapped in the air between them. “Tch… fine, yeah, I’m with LKA, what of it!? …I don’t know what you’re looking for, but it isn’t here! God, the others, then this stupid bird, and now *you*- I oughtta-”

***“SQUAAAAAAAAAAAAK!!!”***

The sudden cry silenced the two’s arguments, a strange and heavy aura seeming to fill the space around them. The quiet held, just for a moment… until a rustling caught the two’s attention. They turned, eyes moving to the source - a candy wrapper, slowly shaking on the ground. Then another sound, from a nearby pizza box. Another, from the trash can. One by one, a number of the miscellaneous scatterings on the boardwalk began to shudder and shake in unison.

And then they floated *up*.

Baygon leapt back, narrowly avoiding a fall as a paper underfoot suddenly lurched up from beneath them, hovering in the air just over their head. Century looked up, eyes darting around from one gravity-defying object to the next, before honing in on that seagull… and spotting the faint glow of a Stand aura around the damned bird.

Slowly, Century took a few steps back… and turned, bolting away as fast as he could.

He didn’t get far. Only a few steps in, a strange plant split the boardwalk open beneath him - Century only had a moment to react, scrambling away just as a huge vine shot up, piercing the space where he’d been standing not moments before.

“Hah… so that’s how it is, is it!?” Century seethed. “Taking my wallet wasn’t enough for you, so now you sic your pet bird on me to finish the job, huh!?”

“Oh for the- do you even hear yourself?” Baygon groaned. “Think, you moron - even ignoring that *you* clearly started this, since you know who we are, do you *really* think we’d do something so petty as pickpocketing? With a *bird*?”

“Of course you would - that’s what *I’d* do!”

Baygon’s face went blank.

“...you know what? Screw this.” Baygon glared, the form of ｢LOVESICK: CANNIBAL!｣ manifesting behind them. “I’m done arguing. This day sucks, these people suck, *you* suck, no one wants to hang out with me and I’ve just about had it - watching you bleed out oughtta make me feel *loads* better!”

“Tch… fine then!” Century met Baygon’s gaze, summoning ｢Play it Safe｣ in turn. “If you and that bird of yours won’t give me a choice, then so be it - one way or another, I’ll *make* you give me back my wallet!”

***“Just shut up and Open the Game.”***

*“Caw!”*

**Location:** A stretch of the [Christiansted Boardwalk in St. Croix](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7Kp0lsM-5Fs/maxresdefault.jpg)! The area [here](https://i.imgur.com/hA0URzR.jpeg) is around 41x41m, with each tile being 1.5x1.5m. The wooden boardwalk itself spans the length of the map, and has several knee-height stone pillars along its edge. Two wooden rowboats are tied up to the pillars, and a third boat is out in the middle of the water. The boardwalk is 0.5m above the water level.

South of the boardwalk is a small plaza, which is mostly empty aside from a few tables and chairs. The ground in the plaza is mostly paved asphalt, aside from a small concrete portion leading out of the building on the west. The south end of the plaza has a small fenced off garden area with shrubs and palm trees, while the east and west sides are bordered by two restaurants, each with outdoor seating and a bar. There is a small grassy strip between the plaza and the western restaurant, with a few more shrubs and palm trees. The circular stone building is an old mill, which has been incorporated into the eastern restaurant. A ladder rests on the side of the mill, granting roof access.

Various bits of trash and litter are scattered across the boardwalk.

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponent!

**Additional Information:** A Stand-using Seagull named Slash is present on the map, and his presence is causing two distinct Stand effects to take place.

First, each object marked with a pink glow has passively begun to float off the ground - each of these objects is currently hovering 2m in the air, and is able to support the weight of anyone standing atop them without falling. While they are nearly impossible to move higher or lower, floating objects can be repositioned horizontally with minimal effort, gliding around as though floating in water.

Second is Slash himself - throughout the match, Slash will fly around the arena, stopping occasionally to steal food or shiny objects that cross his path. If Slash is attacked, startled, or otherwise aggressed upon, he will immediately use his Stand to summon a plant known as a “Thorn Trap” on the ground directly below whatever startled him - once summoned, a thick, thorny 1m long vine will rapidly grow out of the plant, attempting to stab the targeted thing. Thorn Traps have B Pow, A Spd, and E Dur.

Despite having a Stand, Slash is no more intelligent than the average seagull. As such, he can be coerced into moving to specific places or taking simple actions in the same ways one could coerce any other animal to do so. That said, he is generally wary of most people, and is easily startled. He cannot be scared off the map.

Please enjoy and I'd love to see any ""Thoughts"" you guys have unlocked in real life.

Thought Unlocked:
The Vampire

Problem:
It begins slowly. A slipping of time, a muffling of sunlight. What was once morning becomes evening. Breakfast becomes dinner. You eat under flickering fluorescents and sleep while the world turns in gold. No matter how many energy drinks you pour down your throat, your body screams in protest. This isn't natural. Humans were not made for this. You drag your corpse through a care home’s quiet halls while the rest of the world sleeps. Exhausted, altered, undone. The rhythm of the night is not in your blood. Or at least, it wasn't.

But maybe you've been thinking about this wrong.

Solution:
You are not a man.
You are not a worker.
You are a Vampire.

A being untethered from the cycle of the sun. You stalk the twilight hours, unseen and unneeded by the masses. While others dream, you move. While the world sleeps, you watch. You drift through the sterile, buzzing liminality of night shifts, a silent sentinel among the dying, the demented, and the forgotten.

You're not tired — you're eternal.

Yes, coffee still helps. But more than that, you’ve found an identity in the inversion.
You’ve become a nocturnal aristocrat of the fluorescent realm, taking quiet pride in your reversed existence.

You don’t need the day. The day is for fools.

Research:
+1 Electrochemistry: Caffeine is your life blood. now. Nicotine is a sacrament.
+1 Perception: You hear a cough four rooms down, in your sleep-deprived trance.
-1 Logic: You’re starting to believe your own mythology.
-1 Conceptualization: The world is turning gray.

Completion:
+2 Drama: You can now narrate your suffering with Shakespearean grandeur.
+1 Endurance: You endure what should not be endured.
+1 Compusure: Creature of the night.
-1 Encyclopedia: What was that nurse's name again? Does it matter?

I see what you were going for by making the dangerous biomes being impossible to survive without the badges as both a way to progress and for immersion, but the badges and smoothies ain't the solution.  
How about this: Keep the biome challenge runs, but award a blueprint for completing them instead of a badge (and don't make me talk to a damn trader to collect it), and then the player uses that blueprint to craft THERMAL UNDERWEAR or a HAZMAT SUIT or something that allows you to ignore the environmental debuffs in the dangerous biomes.

2: **You need to find a way to make water MORE scarce as the game progresses, not less**  
The problem with the water and jars isn't that it was too easy...finding fresh water in the early game before you have your cooking pot is actually difficult and interesting...it's that the farther you progress in the game, the easier it gets. I made a suggestion in your other thread: actually have fresh water be easy to find in the early game. It's in bev coolers, coffee pots...all over. But as the game state progresses, symbolizing the spreading and intensifying of the zombie virus, you stop finding clean water, and start just finding murky water...then the murky water stops spawning, replaced by VIRAL WATER....then maybe IRRADIATED WATER...each new iteration of the water is more dangerous to consume without purifying it, and requires higher tech and more resources to purify.

3\*\*: Please stop locking progressing behind the traders\*\*  
I understand that y'all don't want to remove the traders from the game, but at least allow me to ignore them if I choose. Don't make me buy something from them to unlock tech, don't make me talk to them to earn a stupid biome badge. I want to survive on my own in the zombie apocalypse. Let me do that.

4: **Just be more cooperative with the modding community.**  
It costs you very little, and it allows us to play the game the way we want to play it. You benefit too, because the happier we are, the more likely we are to invite our friends to get it and play it with us. Hell, if you let the modders go crazy, they might come up with ideas that you can use in the base game.",4,1753920329.0,7daystodie,1,0.75,False
1mdmrw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1mdmrw1/need_advice_avoidant_ex_reached_out_after_months/,"NEED ADVICE: Avoidant ex reached out after months of no contact, but does not want to be exclusive","Hello

this is my first ever reddit post, i am coming here for advice on how to handle this situation. i tend to ramble about random things so i will try my best to be as concise as possible. 

I (19 f) dated my ex (18 m) for a bit over a year and a half. we became best friends the summer going in our senior year of hs. we spent every day together, talking about spirituality , laws of the universe, theories we believed to be true. naturally we kissed one night and continued hooking up for a few weeks. neither of us thought it was an idea to date since we tended to get into disagreements a lot. but some how we fell in love. our senior year was amazing, absolutely no complaints. we communicated very well, spent time together, danced in the kitchen, and overall just enjoyed each other's company. once we graduated we decided to attend the same uni. it was states away from our families but i was glad we had each other. however, it did cause lots anxiety because i knew how much we both wanted to be our own people and gain separate experinces. 

at first we did a well enough job of us spending our days out and about with our friends or at classes. but we did see each other many times a week, alone if able to. i liked it that way. eventually my ex began getting high everyday and at first it didnt bother me. he was so loving and silly when high and his smile was my favorite thing to see. but then i noticed he was very distant and often irritable when smoking and even worse when sober. his grades began to drop and his personality completely changed. around this same time i began having major issues with my dorm roomate. i hated being there, i was uncomfortable and scared around her. i leaned on my ex for support a lot. (now i understand how that made him feel suffocated) but overall we began fighting a lot about his smoking habits, lack of motivation, bad grades, and me always needing attention and love. i pushed, he pulled. there is a lot more about this issue (we were on and off for months)

however in march of this year we offically called it quits. we went no contact and it was terrible. the first few weeks i couldnt eat, get out of bed, brush my teeth, and sat for hours outside the police department building up the courage to ask for mental help. finally the school year was over and i went home. i was still devasted about the break up but also i knew it was time for me to start working on myself in order to heal. i began going to the gym, seeing a therapist again, tidying my room, journaling multiplte times a day. 

life began to feel worth it. the work i was putting in felt amazing, i finally had my own back and shoulder to lean on. i have come so far in my mental health and spiritual journey. 

at some point i reached out to my ex and did the whole i miss our friendship thing. he very kindly told me he was not ready. that didnt hurt nearly as much as i expected. i took it very well by remembering it was not personal and that i am strong enough now to support myself. that was nearly two months ago.

then last week i get a text. my ex's name pops up on my phone. my heart sank. i was very werry of looking at it at first out of fear of so many things. long story short he missed our friendship and we eventually decided to grab coffee and meet up. it went perfectly fine. we obvisouly both missed one another and were happy to see each other. 

he asked if i would want to hang out again soon and i did. we made plans to go the lake front together like we used to do. but the day of our plans we decdied to just go to his house. we watched a movie, laughed and play some board games. eventually he grabbed on to my hand and pulled me into a cuddle. (we used to cuddle as friends all the time so i was not sure what to think of this, but it felt safe). we began kissing and embracing. telling each other how much we love the other. this went on for awhile. but we both knew that there were things to be talked about. i asked if we were just friends and we both gave each other a little smile. i knew from the moment i agreed to coffee that things were going to move slowly so i wasnt worried. but eventually he told me that he ""cannot"" be exclusive and deny his mind and body the need for excitment and situlation else where but that he loved me and wanted me.  he is very avoidant and explained that he cannot have someone else control him. this confused me. he was never a sexual person when we dated and he most definealy connected with me on a deeper more real level than sex. (i want to note that we both knew/told each other that we had slept with someone since our break up and have been all summer) 

i told him i was not okay with that and that he  needed to either be ""with"" (not dating or tied down just not having sex with other woman) or i am done this time. i told him how much he had hurt me and that i wasnt going to let him again. i am stronger now. we talked about different ways in which we could find a middle ground. he suggested that i can continute sleeping with the boy that i am currently seeing if he could do the same. but he talked about how he didnt want to share me with others and basically dissed his own idea. my suggestion was truly how i felt. i dont care if he goes out, dances with girls, flirts and has fun (since we are not dating and do not plan to at least right now) but i am not comfortable with him texting or sleeping with other girls. i dont want him to feel suffocated and like he cant hang out with his friends and get drunk and be a flirt. just DONT HOOK UP WITH THEM.

we basically have come to a standstill. we cannot agree on a middle ground and yet we are not willing to give each other up. we have booked a couples therapy appointment for next week because i want to understand him better and he feels the same. 

what advice can you guys give me? 

i know whats going on is bad and i know i have the right to say no and leave, but i dont want to.",1,1753920303.0,AvoidantBreakUps,4,1.0,False
1mdmri6,https://i.redd.it/6zz73sdgp3gf1.jpeg,The Shared Values of Western Empire: Sacred Cows and Sacrifical Children,"There is a very old religion still practiced in the West, though few will admit to worshipping at its altar.

Its gods demand blood, not prayers. Their liturgies are silent, spoken only in budgets and airstrikes. Their priests wear suits, not cassocks, and speak of “freedom,” “shared values,” and “the rules-based international order” while they hand sharpened blades to those who slaughter the innocent.

This faith, call it what you will: Empire, Zionism, Security, Civilization, the Free World, requires one sacrament above all: the ritualised sacrifice of children.

Not symbolically. Literally.
It is no longer shocking. It has become normal. But it is not new. It is simply the old normal, now AI-optimised, efficiently live-streamed, and publicly laundered into strategic necessity.

Gaza is where the mask slips. Where the West’s moral architecture collapses in real time. Where thousands upon thousands of children have been sacrificed, incinerated, crushed, orphaned, dismembered, not for some unknowable evil, but for the continued viability of a failing settler colony propped up by the myth of eternal victimhood.

Israel is the altar. America is the priest. And Palestinians, especially their children, are the offering.

Western politicians perform their sacred duty: to weep just enough, to whisper regret, to chant the holy phrase: “Israel has the right to defend itself.” It is an exorcism of responsibility. A baptism in blood.

And the congregants, ordinary citizens of the West, are expected to tithe. Through taxes. Through silence. Through looking away. Through swallowing lie after lie, even when the lies become absurd.

Don’t ask who rules the world. Ask who’s expected to dry-clean Netanyahu’s underpants when he arrives in Washington.

This is not metaphor. During official visits to the U.S., Israeli Prime Ministers routinely bring suitcases of dirty laundry for American staff to wash and return. 

They do this because they know it will be done. Expecting the USA to launder Israel's soiled bed linen is not a request, it is their divine right. It is the honour and national duty of American Presidents to be seen paying tribute at the Wailing Wall when in Jerusalem, and to dry-clean Bibi’s underpants when he visits Washington. 

On occasion, the Prime Minister requires even more. The United States is expected to kiss the ring, maintain the illusion, and offer full diplomatic service, like an Epstein girl trained to smile, say nothing, and never forget who’s really in charge.

Such is the theatre of Western submission.
Israel is the sacred cow of Western geopolitics. It must be protected at all costs. And like all sacred cows, it demands slaughter to stay fed.

What is the cost? Measured not only in children’s corpses, but in the spiritual mutilation of entire societies. What happens to a culture that convinces itself, over and over, that the deaths of children are unfortunate but necessary? That their lives are less real, less sacred, than the myths we’ve built around ourselves?

In Israel, it looks like eighteen-year-olds conscripted to surveil and shoot children in the name of “defence.” 

In America, it looks like a generation so numbed by school shootings that they shrug and call genocide “complicated” while they wait for genocide sponsoring coffee at StarBucks.

Every now and then, the mask slips, revealing not a statesman’s face, but the leering grin of a necromancer… or perhaps a sex-trafficking financier, diligently recording his offerings of children to the altar of American power.

The same nation convulsed in moral panic over Q-Anon fairy tales of elites harvesting children’s blood now funds, with bipartisan enthusiasm, the real-time incineration of children by a foreign military. 

The same people who wept for imaginary adrenochrome victims are happy to subsidise actual mass murder, so long as it comes wrapped in an Israeli flag and Joe Biden or Donald Trump says, “trust me bro.”

The sacrifice is sacred. The questioning of it is obscene, but even the most blood-soaked cult cannot last forever.

Every empire collapses under the weight of its own rituals. And one day, the priests will be seen for what they are. And the child matyrs we offered, burned and broken, buried beneath rubble and rhetoric, will rise in memory and judgment.

Let the reader understand: this is not policy. This is religion.

And its God-King is a liar.

1mdmp1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mdmp1q/aita_for_wanting_to_pursue_my_dream_at_uni_even/,AITA for wanting to pursue my dream at uni even though it means going against my father who says it's a 'waste of time',"Throwaway, obviously. This is long and probably too dramatic, but it’s my life right now, and I honestly don’t know what to do.

I’m a **17-year-old girl (18 in one week)**, and in just six weeks I’m supposed to move into university to start the course I’ve worked my entire life for. My dream is to become a **Behavioral Investigative Advisor (BIA)**. I’ve always been fascinated by the human mind—why people make the choices they do, especially in high-stakes or criminal contexts. I want to help catch the worst people in the world and figure out how to stop them before they act. I’m not in this for fame or money—it’s obsession, purpose, clarity. I’ve never wavered. This is what I want.

And I didn’t just float through school hoping it’d happen. I worked my **entire ass off** to get here. I got **7 GCSEs at grades 8-9**, and then **straight As at A-Level** in subjects like psychology, sociology, and law—every module chosen carefully to support this exact goal. I applied to a top university, the same one my older cousin graduated from, and got in on my first try. My spot is confirmed. My accommodation is booked and paid. My course is finalised. I’ve even got my supplies and schedule sorted.

And my mum—bless her—is working overtime just to help me afford things student loans won’t cover. She doesn’t have much, but she believes in me so fiercely it makes me want to cry. She's been quietly draining her savings, paycheck after paycheck, just to keep this dream alive.

But then there’s my dad.

My dad (Mark, 48) and I used to be **so close**. We bonded over true crime documentaries when I was still in primary school. We'd pause scenes and talk theories, dissect motivations, predict outcomes. He used to say, “You’re going to be *something*, kid.” He pushed me into grammar school because he believed in my brain. He was *proud*. I was *his*.

But now? He’s telling everyone that uni is “a scam.” That my dream is “pointless.” That I’ll come out “broke and bitter.” He’s obsessed with this new narrative that degrees are worthless, and somehow it all started with **Lisa (45)**—his new client and possibly the most delusional woman alive.

Lisa is, for lack of a kinder phrase, *cringe incarnate*. She clings to my dad like he’s a prize she won at a raffle. Loud, flirty in a way that makes your skin crawl, and so wildly obsessed with him that she’ll find any excuse to show up at our house, bringing coffee or business folders she “forgot to drop off” (every day???).

She has a daughter, **Chloe (16)**, who got **expelled from school**, is now **pregnant**, and supposedly just “bought a house” while working some mystery job. I don’t even know how, but Lisa keeps bringing her up like she’s the ultimate proof that *school is for suckers*. My dad, for whatever reason, eats this up. He’s now comparing *me*—someone who’s given everything to this dream—to *Chloe* like we’re both options on a shelf. Like I’m the expensive bottle of wine and she’s the boxed stuff and he’s suddenly convinced the boxed wine is better.

He tells me I’m wasting time, chasing an “imaginary” job, that I’ll “end up just like everyone else.” And by that, he means his own niece and nephew—**Sarah (24)** and **Ethan (22)**, my cousins on his side.

Ethan just finished a biology degree at another prestigious uni and can’t find a job in his field. Sarah graduated from the **same uni I’m going to** and is absolutely *thriving*—just not in a job related to her degree. She’s working as a researcher for documentaries and indie films now, traveling constantly, and living a life that honestly looks amazing. But my dad uses her as an example of “wasted potential,” like her success isn’t valid because it’s not what she studied. It’s infuriating.

Meanwhile, Lisa’s in his ear 24/7, telling him how “strong women make their own way,” how “Chloe is thriving without ever needing qualifications,” how “university is a trap”—and somehow, *this woman*, this overgrown groupie with a delusional saviour complex and clown-level makeup, has more influence over my dad than *I do*.

And now? My dad has flipped. Fully. He says if I go to uni, he won’t support me emotionally or financially. He won’t help with emergencies. He won’t “rescue me when reality hits.” His words. All because I’m refusing to drop my dream and… what? Become a cashier? Apprentice in a trade I don’t care about? Stay home and rot while Lisa and Chloe host baby showers?

To top it off, my parents are now fighting constantly. My mum is done with his attitude and his weird attachment to Lisa. She called him out on comparing Chloe’s “miracle pregnancy housing scheme” to *our daughter’s entire future.* My dad just said, “Well, at least she has a future.” I don’t think I’ll ever forget the way my mum went quiet.

Now, the house is tense. I feel sick every day. I want to go, but part of me feels guilty for tearing the family apart. Like if I just gave it up, things would calm down. But I also know if I don’t go, I’ll lose everything I’ve worked for.

So I guess I’m asking… AITA?

AITA for still wanting to go to university, after everything? For pursuing a career that my dad now thinks is beneath me? For not wanting to be the next “Chloe”—glorified for surviving a mess I worked my whole life to avoid?

Because if I go, I’ll break something that might not be repairable.  
But if I stay, I think I’ll break *me*.

1mdmp10,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateNightUrbanFantasy/comments/1mdmp10/blood_red_champagne_rewrite/,Blood Red Champagne (Rewrite),"Ruby stood outside a door. She fiddled with the letter in her hand, nervous about entering the towering building in front of her. Inside was her crush, a boy named Will. She had finally worked up the courage to confess; now here she was with that same courage melting out of her, like vanilla ice cream on a hot summer day. Ruby sighed and turned around to leave. Maybe she realized that knowing where Will lived would be read as creepy. She walked away, trying to think of something else. 

Bam! Ruby bumped into a woman making cuts of meat rain down on the concrete streets. “I’m sorry,” she yelped, quickly crouching to the woman. The woman looked like a butcher; she wore a stained apron that complemented her dark orange clothes, and her espresso colored skin was dappled with black freckles. Her hair was styled in an afro, which covered her eyes, it was the same orange as her clothes. When the last of the meats was picked up, Ruby noticed that the letter was missing. Frantically, she looked for it in her pocket, then around her but she couldn't find it. “Is this was your looking for, hon” The woman asked holding Ruby’s letter. “Yes,” she answered clutching it closely. “Who’s the lucky boy” the woman asked gently, she paused shyly not really wanting to answer. “Listen, dear” the woman said softly grabbing Ruby’s hand “They say that the way to a man heart is through his stomach, that means you should make him a feast.” In her hands, the woman left Ruby a small business then she left. 

Later that day, Ruby found herself entering a small butcher shop near George Town University. The inside was cleaner than she’d expected, in fact she couldn't see any ofthe meat. It looked more like a cute little coffee shop. “H-hello,” Ruby called into the semi-empty space. “Your here,” exclaimed the woman whose name was Ms.M. She hugged Ruby like they were old friends, and led her to the kitchen. Different ingredients lined up the various steel tables, all fresh and waiting to be used. “Now,” Ms.M said clapping her hands “do you know the boy’s taste” Ruby though a for awhile. “Yeah,” she said “I remember him liking pineapple and chicken skewer.” “That’s easy” Ms.M assured her “Now lets gets cooking!” The kitchen was filled with the warmth of laughter and the scent of the sweet and spicy recipe, the skewer looked like everything Ruby hoped for.

Ms.M was right, the next day during second lunch she approached Will and offered the dish. He gladly accepted and complimented her cooking. Then a girl walked up to them, she had a clear complexion and bookish looked to her. Ruby left after that; she wasn’t sure if that new emotion swelling inside her was jealousy but she it wasn't definitely positive. The rest of the day, she was ecstatic, other than that girl, everything went according to plan. Soon, he’ll be all hers. Ruby nodded everything that Will did, what he liked, what he hated and close to him was always that girl.

She found herself going back to Ms.M’s shop; maybe Ms.M had other advice. When Ruby walked in, Ms.M greeted her with a giant hug. “Did he like it” She asked her, Ruby nodded which made both of them squeal with joy. “Now,” Ms.M said with a smile “what are you going to do next,” “I don’t know” Ruby answered truthfully “do you have any other advice.” Ms.M tapped her finger against he chin deep in thought, then she turned around and scavenged for something behind the shop’s counter. It was a black and white photo of Ms.M in a silk white wedding dress practically glowing with happiness and besides her was a man that looked nervous. “Do you want me to teach you how to win him over” She asked Ruby, she nodded Ms. M knew what she was doing which would help her win over Will. 

“Boy like a girl that looks like a doll” so Ruby started dressing in a reddish-gray overall dress and a headband in the same color underneath was a dark grey skirt and matching socks; Will didn't even notice. “They also love a woman with musical talents,” he ‘accidentally’ found her playing on the piano but he excused himself thinking that he walked into the wrong room. “And if that doesn't work, confess since men like woman that are honest.” Ruby was waiting outside of Will's classroom, she watched as his classmates poured out until it was her, him and the gril from before. “I like you, Will” she confessed to him, “I want you to be my boyfriend.” There was a silence that grew between the three, “I’m sorry” Will said cautiously “I have a girlfriend.” He moved toward the girl, “Okay” Ruby said holding down tears “that’s fine.” 

After school, Ruby was sobbing in Ms. M’s arms. It wasn't fair, she tried and tried, but that other girl won his heart. How, if the most she’d seen of them together was the day she gave him the skewer. “How did you deal with this” Ruby asked in between sobs, “I want to show you something,” Ms.M said guiding her gently towards the kitchen. She pulled a loose brick from the wall, but it wasn’t a brick, it was an old worn out box. Inside the box, was a knife it was chipped with age and a fainted photo. The photo was of a blooded woman, her face was frozen in fear. “Listen closely, dear” Ms.M said handing Ruby the knife “you need to get rid of this whore by ANY means necessary. Take her to Rock Creek park, I will help you” ",1,1753920089.0,LateNightUrbanFantasy,0,1.0,False

I finished pulling out the rest of the compost, it's not as clean as the image seems. I used a shovle that was my FIL which is probably older than me. So the sholve was free, his privilege afforded it. I used a yard rake which cost $15 to create a V. I tossed in two 5gl buckets of food scraps which I saved over three months. How could I afford to not eat so much food you ask? About half of it was rinds from watermelons and pineapple that were on sale, fruit that went bad quickly because it was on sale. A 2L of root beer my mother gave to me last year and I never drank, and then leftovers that ended up going bad. I also had a 50lb bag of used coffee grounds that was free. The hay that's on top I got for free last November from a church pumpkin patch. I spent 1 hour a day after work for several days digging all this out, tossing in all the scraps, covering it all up. It's about 4 hours of work total in 100+ heat and humidity in Houston, TX with no shade. Four hours of free exercise because my privilege doesn't have the time or money for an actual gym membership. As for the original dirt, you can see where a very large raised bed used to be. I got the wood to build it free from Craigslist three years ago. Now it's all rotted so I had to dispose of it. I plan on clearing the whole square area from the old raised beds to the new ones and turning it into a 400sqft garden. Oh, those two ""new"" raised beds were built from the fence post that fell after I lost nearly all my fence lines from hurricane Beryl. As for my privilege of owning a home, you're all more than welcome to take over my student loans that afforded me a good job. I'm not going to feel bad about all the hard work I put in to get into this fixer upper home I have and none of you know anything about how I grew up. So check your ASSumptions. I'm sure no matter what I say, you'll find something to complain about. Just remember, we all do better when we work together than break each other down.",6,1753920040.0,composting,8,0.71,False

Edit - this is on the Islander 

TL;DR - We had a blast.

My husband (43) & I (40) sailed on the Islander Sun 7/20 to Fri 7/25. It was not the itinerary I wanted but July 20 was my 40th birthday and I wanted to be on the ship on my birthday. So we booked Key West & Progreso.

We’re mostly land vacationers and when we do sail, it’s in the Haven on NCL but we’re big Jimmy Buffett fans & I really wanted to try Margaritaville at Sea. So I read and watched a bunch of reviews before we decided on it. We went with the Live Life Like a Song signature suite, 7231 Lovely Cruise. 

[Photos 1](https://imgur.com/a/Y9Ab6DY)  
[Photos 2](https://imgur.com/a/dVLgfi4)

Pros -

* Crew
   * The crew was amazing. I’d seen it in reviews but it’s true. Everyone from our room steward to bartenders to casino dealers to dining room servers was excellent.
* Food
   * I was pleasantly surprised by the food! The buffet was definitely the weak link but all the inclusive food options ranged from good to excellent. The (daytime) pizza is AMAZING. At some point in the evening (maybe around 9 or 10p?), it does switch over from a woodfired type crust to a thicker crust. It’s not quite deep dish but it’s definitely thicker than hand tossed. It was okay but not as good as the daytime pizza. The tacos at Mexican Cutie Cantina were excellent. The burger bar was delicious. Islander dining ranged from not bad to ‘wow, that’s surprisingly good!’ We did the steakhouse on night one & it was excellent. Bubbles Up Brunch (or whatever it’s called now) was really good and worth the cost, IMO.
* Themeing
   * Again, big Jimmy Buffett fans. You hear “Margaritaville at Sea” and you go in with certain expectations of how “Margaritaville” it will be. It was spot on! There’s subtle touches like fishie chandeliers in the dining rooms and punch you in the face touches like the giant flip flop in the atrium.. It wasn’t all Jimmy Buffett music, all the time, which was good. It was island music, sing-along piano player, steel drums, an electric violin, etc. We greatly enjoyed all of it.
* Unique entertainment offerings
   * The crew talent show was AMAZING. I’d never heard of that on any other cruise I’d been on. It was so fun seeing everyone showcase their talents. The guitar tech for the shows played Purple Rain. One of the bar managers absolutely belted out a Josh Groban song. They were all so good. On the last day, the stewards had a towel animal showcase. So many unique animals outside of the standard elephant and bear!
* Spa
   * My husband & I both got Swedish massages with hot stones & a pedicure. They were phenomenal. Prices were comparable to other major cruise lines & I thought quality was too. So, we found them worth it. My husband had never had a pedicure before & now he’s addicted. He keeps marveling at how soft his feet are.

Cons - 

* It’s definitely a 25 year old ship & it’s very noticeable in some ways.
   * There was a ton of rust on our balcony, the public bathrooms look like they’ve never been updated, the engine noise/vibration was extremely noticeable on the lower decks, our cabin A/C didn’t work the first 2 nights, we didn’t have hot water in our shower the first 2 nights.
* Dining hours 
   * There are chunks of time when literally no (complimentary) food is available. If you’re a late breakfaster, bummer. I’m on vacation, I want to sleep in, but breakfast ended at 10:30a and I got to the dining areas at 10:45a. I have to either wait until shit reopens at noon or pay for something from the coffee shop. Same with dinner. Also, the Mexican Cutie Cantina was only open noon - 4ish. I would have loved to grab some tasty tacos for dinner.
* The lax “no one is too drunk” rule
   * I get it. It’s a Margaritaville cruise. But wow. There were people, every night, in the casino, that should have been escorted to bed. I was shocked by some of the things people were getting away with (specifically in the casino). Though, we didn’t see anyone puke…so maybe that’s the line?
* Lack of trash cans
   * I know that’s nitpicky but there’s seriously no trashcans anywhere but the bathrooms. 

Tips

* JWB Steakhouse has 50% off wine on embarkation day. We went (didn’t bother making a reservation) & it was pretty dead. 50% off even applied to champagne, so we splurged on a bottle of Dom Perignon for my birthday. The food & service were fantastic.
* The spa runs specials each day, they’re announced in the daily. The embarkation specials are the best though. 
* Drinks ARE free while gambling in the casino. I wouldn’t bother buying the drink package next time. The drinks we got outside the casino would not have made the package price worth it. 
* Holiday Inn Express Tampa East - Ybor City had free breakfast & a free shuttle to the port. It was also the most reasonably priced hotel around there.
* Keep a [deck plan ](https://e04edc66-00f8-4052-ab44-61cd32db265e.usrfiles.com/ugd/d131be_a8fd9446fd104d8ba8066dadf65208f3.pdf)on your phone. We found there wasn’t really adequate signage around the ship. The elevators had lists of what was on each deck but not really anywhere else. If you’re leaving your cabin on 7 and trying to go to the Islander dining room, it takes a hot minute to figure out where you’re going.
* Ship stays on Tampa time. I’d never experienced this before. Every cruise I’ve taken, the ship stays on local time, not embarkation port time. I had my phone on airplane mode with the wifi OFF and my clock still updated. It messed up our Progreso plan. They recommend you turn off auto update but I assumed airplane mode would take care of that. It did not.

Would we do it again? Absolutely! We accumulated so many points in the casino, we both earned free cruises already. We wouldn’t book a suite though (unless the casino gave it to us free!). The price vs perks is not worth it. The upgraded cabin (especially bathroom, yes the shower fits 2 adults) & priority embarkation/disembarkation were awesome but not something I need. The suites’ concierge lounge was useful once (one of our suitcases wasn’t delivered, the luggage tag had ripped off, & the concierge found it in about 5 minutes) but generally just had cans of pop, OJ, & coffee available. So, useful if you have an issue but outside of missing luggage, we didn’t. Most other cruise lines have significantly more suite perks and since this was a similar price point to other lines’ suites, I was disappointed in that. Not even priority seating in the dining rooms.

**My foot story**

I want to emphasize this was in NO WAY MaS’s fault. It was 100% my own doing & was just bad luck.

On Friday, the 25th, we’re all packed, ready to disembark, & I’m doing one last walk through of the cabin to make sure we didn’t forget anything. Like most cruise furniture, the little dining table & chairs are SOLID and heavy AF. I stubbed my left toes on the chair leg. The leg went in between my 4th & 5th toes. It hurt so bad I thought maybe I had ruptured it. Luckily, no blood, no bones sticking at weird angles, etc. So I gingerly put my shoe on & we left.

Our flight wasn’t until 2p & we had considered going to the aquarium but by the time we got off the ship and made it through customs (which was SUPER fast), I could barely walk. So we chose a local coffee shop, Ubered there, and got breakfast. We hung around for about 2 hours then just headed to the airport. Got another bite to eat, hung around for 4 more hours, then boarded. While sitting at the airport, I made a MedCheck appointment for Saturday morning. Once there, I got xrays & they confirmed a broken foot. I stubbed my toe so hard I broke my foot. 🤦‍♀️ They gave me a post op shoe (like a boot but only ankle high) & I have an ortho appointment this Friday. It feels better but is still blue/purple & swollen. So. Fun! Great way to end vacation!

1mdmlq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1mdmlq8/is_it_possible_that_its_more_than_a_situationship/,is it possible that it’s more than a situationship? or am I delusional? Should I start seeing other people?,"I (22F) met this guy (28M) almost 2 years ago. We met at a local show and he was a friend of a friend and reached out to me after cause he was interested after meeting me. We talked for about a month, went on movie dates, coffee dates, would hug and kiss goodbye, sleep together, see each other almost everyday, text everyday, etc. After a few months things felt off and I noticed him distancing himself (taking longer to respond and seeing less of him). I noticed this and when I’d try to pull away he’d double text even after hours of HIM not responding. 

About 5 months into knowing him (we had stopped sleeping together and kissing/hugging one another) he told me he had started seeing someone else and asked “if I’d be mad”. I care for him a lot and I care more to have him in my life so I told him that he could tell me all about her and so he did. He broke my heart telling me that he “hadn’t felt this way for someone in so long” and that they’d “accidentally had to meet his sister” and that “she really seemed interested in getting to know his family” but it ended messy cause that girl had a relationship the whole time. YIKES! But I was, of course, there to help pick up the pieces. For the next 8 months, I attempted to talk to other people and so did he but we still talked every day and were actually becoming really close. At the end of those 8 months when he was trying to talk to another girl he told me that I made it really difficult for him because we just got along so well and we understood one another so good. This caused one of my first crashouts in front of him. I just asked him why it could never work between us and I can’t feel this way for anyone else. He couldn’t give me an answer - I asked him if I was ugly and he told me he thought I was beautiful! I asked if I was annoying and he laughed saying no! He had no reason! No explanation for me! For about a month we crashed out on one another back and forth - never aggressive but it was like we just needed to confide in one another all the time. I even left work early one time because he left me a crashout voicemail and that morning was the first time he ever said he loved me as I wiped the tears from his eyes. 

By thanksgiving, I couldn’t do it anymore so I cut him off. He told me he didn’t want the “no contact” but he wanted me to be okay. And that I was someone he’d really come to like knowing. By Christmas, I left gifts on his doorstep (without a word) and just like that, he had called me crying and the no contact had been broken…things shifted a lot between us. He was calling me throughout the month of January while he was out of state. Every day I got a call from him - whether it be 2 minutes or 2 hours. 
January and February were mostly the same but we started also hanging out at the gym together. We’d go together and he taught me tons of different exercises and techniques. He’d get silly and offended if I went without him and I noticed he’d seem off if this one gym bro would ask him about me and yet he’d always tell him “me and her are just friends.” He told everyone that. During spring break, we started sleeping together and have been since then. We see each other every single day and he asks me to spend the night every other night. Keep in mind, it’s not just sex, he invites me over to cuddle or watch him just do his daily activities. We parallel play a lot - me on my iPad and him on his computer listening to music or watching stupid shows together. We’ve traveled together, and even have plans for more trips in October and November. He even invited me on a two week trip with him in June (I couldn’t cause WORK).

It feels like a relationship but feeling like a secret is what makes it feel like a situationship. Him never meeting my family, his family not knowing about me (their relationship isn’t very close so it’s not too bad I guess), him telling people we are just friends (I haven’t really heard him say that in a while BUT STILL), him not inviting me out with him and his friends (kinda because I think me and him both know we wouldn’t mesh well lol), and us not kissing goodbye and only hugging goodbye ALLLL MAKES IT FEEL LIKE A SITUATIONSHIP.  But there’s so much that feels like more. We just never talk about it. He’s told me before that he’s not good at communicating or bringing things up. And I’m not either!! It’s so frustrating!! He gets jealous. I get jealous. He rejects people who come onto him. I do too. It’s like we are doing the thing without the title and I never thought I’d care but I guess I DO. I want to KNOW that I am more than just a friend. 

Am I just being delusional for thinking this is more?? Am I stuck in a game I should’ve gotten out of long ago?! Should I start seeing other people despite this?? Help!",1,1753919859.0,Situationships,1,1.0,False

1mdmkus,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mdmkus/the_western_empires_shared_values_sacred_cows_and/,The Western Empire's Shared Values: Sacred Cows and Sacrifical Children,"There is a very old religion still practiced in the West, though few will admit to worshipping at its altar.

Its gods demand blood, not prayers. Their liturgies are silent, spoken only in budgets and airstrikes. Their priests wear suits, not cassocks, and speak of “freedom,” “shared values,” and “the rules-based international order” while they hand sharpened blades to those who slaughter the innocent.

This faith, call it what you will: Empire, Zionism, Security, Civilization, the Free World, requires one sacrament above all: the ritualised sacrifice of children.

Not symbolically. Literally.
It is no longer shocking. It has become normal. But it is not new. It is simply the old normal, now AI-optimised, efficiently live-streamed, and publicly laundered into strategic necessity.

Gaza is where the mask slips. Where the West’s moral architecture collapses in real time. Where thousands upon thousands of children have been sacrificed, incinerated, crushed, orphaned, dismembered, not for some unknowable evil, but for the continued viability of a failing settler colony propped up by the myth of eternal victimhood.

Israel is the altar. America is the priest. And Palestinians, especially their children, are the offering.

Western politicians perform their sacred duty: to weep just enough, to whisper regret, to chant the holy phrase: “Israel has the right to defend itself.” It is an exorcism of responsibility. A baptism in blood.

And the congregants, ordinary citizens of the West, are expected to tithe. Through taxes. Through silence. Through looking away. Through swallowing lie after lie, even when the lies become absurd.

Don’t ask who rules the world. Ask who’s expected to dry-clean Netanyahu’s underpants when he arrives in Washington.

This is not metaphor. During official visits to the U.S., Israeli Prime Ministers routinely bring suitcases of dirty laundry for American staff to wash and return. 

They do this because they know it will be done. Expecting the USA to launder Israel's soiled bed linen is not a request, it is their divine right. It is the honour and national duty of American Presidents to be seen paying tribute at the Wailing Wall when in Jerusalem, and to dry-clean Bibi’s underpants when he visits Washington. 

On occasion, the Prime Minister requires even more. The United States is expected to kiss the ring, maintain the illusion, and offer full diplomatic service, like an Epstein girl trained to smile, say nothing, and never forget who’s really in charge.

Such is the theatre of Western submission.
Israel is the sacred cow of Western geopolitics. It must be protected at all costs. And like all sacred cows, it demands slaughter to stay fed.

What is the cost? Measured not only in children’s corpses, but in the spiritual mutilation of entire societies. What happens to a culture that convinces itself, over and over, that the deaths of children are unfortunate but necessary? That their lives are less real, less sacred, than the myths we’ve built around ourselves?

In Israel, it looks like eighteen-year-olds conscripted to surveil and shoot children in the name of “defence.” 

In America, it looks like a generation so numbed by school shootings that they shrug and call genocide “complicated” while they wait for genocide sponsoring coffee at StarBucks.

Every now and then, the mask slips, revealing not a statesman’s face, but the leering grin of a necromancer… or perhaps a sex-trafficking financier, diligently recording his offerings of children to the altar of American power.

The same nation convulsed in moral panic over Q-Anon fairy tales of elites harvesting children’s blood now funds, with bipartisan enthusiasm, the real-time incineration of children by a foreign military. 

The same people who wept for imaginary adrenochrome victims are happy to subsidise actual mass murder, so long as it comes wrapped in an Israeli flag and Joe Biden or Donald Trump says, “trust me bro.”

The sacrifice is sacred. The questioning of it is obscene, but even the most blood-soaked cult cannot last forever.

Every empire collapses under the weight of its own rituals. And one day, the priests will be seen for what they are. And the child matyrs we offered, burned and broken, buried beneath rubble and rhetoric, will rise in memory and judgment.

Let the reader understand: this is not policy. This is religion.

And its God-King is a liar.

Why are you asking for that? My fiancé's family are easy going (because he's a male not because they're mentally stable people or anything maybe they're worse with their own daughters idk) so i always feel bad like why do i have to go through all this drama and if we go out it's a fuckin 2 ish hours around my home and I'm always so heartbroken when I go out because of the drama they make and the toxic words they fed me like (don't be a whOre we know you whOre we're watching you) and even more that cant be translated into English because it doesn't have an equivalent in English language

I recently launched the MVP of my micro-SaaS project and I'm looking for some early beta testers to try it out and share feedback.

It's called **Release Fast** — a tool that helps developers and teams automatically generate release notes about new updates using AI. 

🧠 What it does:

* Connects to your **GitHub** repository**;**
* Analyzes your code changes (diffs) between versions;
* Uses AI to **generate a human-readable changelog;**
* Keeps a clean timeline of version history;

🙌 Why I built it:

I was tired of writing changelogs manually or forgetting to notify users about changes. I wanted something that just… handled it.

This is ideal for solo devs, indie hackers, or small SaaS teams who want to ship fast and still keep their users informed.

# 🧪 Looking for:

* Feedback on usability
* Suggestions on features or improvements
* Bug reports (if you break it, I owe you a coffee ☕)

You can try it for free here: [https://www.releasefast.io/](https://www.releasefast.io/)

Would love to find or help start a little circle of local moms who:
	•	Value honesty over perfection
	•	Can laugh at the chaos while still taking care of each other
	•	Aren’t afraid to say “this is hard” sometimes
	•	Are open to building genuine friendship (not just baby talk, but life talk too)

I’m in the DTC , but willing to travel a bit for the right vibes—cafés, park hangs, farmer’s market meetups, you name it. Let’s build a little village, yeah?

1mdmi7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1mdmi7x/my_best_friends_husband_is_an_absolute_horrible/,My best friend’s husband is an absolute horrible father and partner.  What should I do?,"My best friend confides in me almost daily about her husband, and every day I feel like it’s time to tell her the truth. 

I have always kept my replies to her fairly reserved because I am very aware of what my place is here, but recently the things she has said have been so concerning I am having a hard time biting my tongue. 

For context: My friend’s son is now 2.5 years old and her husband has basically never been left alone with him (a few times with aid/supervision from in-laws). He never offers to watch him, he never even “babysits” so my friend can have her alone time or go out with friends. 

Her husband does offer extreme financial stability for their family, and is definitely the “bread-winner”, but that is constantly being used as en excuse to not care about their child or her mental health. I can’t help but assume they truly rushed into having children and my heart hurts for this little boy. 

Some recent developments: 

1. My friend got very sick and he never once offered to pick up their son from daycare, do dinner time, or put him to bed. Prior to her sickness, he’s also never once done dinner time or bath time regardless of her asking him too. 

2. My friend constantly has to remind him to pick up after himself or show any effort at all. He is constantly gaming with friends or out golfing. Even on weekends (the two days they get together as a family), he always has other plans. 

3. Every day there is a new weaponized incompetence story. “Oh I didn’t know he (their son) couldn’t eat this” or “I didn’t know the bath had to be this temp”. etc. etc. 

Every day it gets worse. To the point where my friend bursted into tears the last time I went over. I brought her a coffee and bagel from her favourite shop and she just lost it. She couldn’t even fathom someone doing something nice for her and my heart broke. 

She bounces around the topic of separation, but I can tell she knows something isn’t right. She’s expressed she feels trapped, she feels like a single mother, but she couldn’t imagine her life without him. He’s not the father or husband she needs him to be or thought he would be. 

It’s truly not my place, but at what point am I a bad friend for not advocating for her to leave. How many times does she need to cry to me before it is my place to say something. I’m torn.

My Breville Infuser sadly gave out about two years ago (a tragic loss ❤️‍🩹). At the time, we picked up a Nespresso machine, thinking we might eventually get the Breville repaired. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered how unfriendly Breville machines are when it comes to repairs.

I’ve now had enough of expensive pods and underwhelming coffee. I’m ready to dive back into the world of real espresso and make the jump to my first manual machine.

I’ve done some research and I’m currently torn between two options: the Gaggia Classic Pro E24 and the Lelit Anna 2 with PID.

I’d love to hear your thoughts! Which would you go for, and why? Any insights or alternative recommendations would be very appreciated.

Also - I’ll be needing a good budget-friendly grinder to go with it, so feel free to drop your recommendations for that too 🤞🏼

1mdmew6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mdmew6/i_clicked_a_reddit_5050_link_i_think_what_i_saw/,I clicked a Reddit 50/50 link… I think what I saw is still watching me…,"I’m writing because the last few days have been some of the most taxing I’ve ever experienced, and I need advice… or maybe not advice exactly. I just need help making sure I’m not losing my mind.

It all started a few days ago. I won’t lie — I was a bit under the influence, scrolling through some Reddit 50/50s. You know, the page that gives you two possible outcomes: one wholesome like puppies, the other usually something gross or NSFW. The twist is, you don’t get to choose — it’s random what you’ll see when you click.

It had been a long, stressful week at work, so I planned to unwind. I was drinking — about a beer per page — so by the time I hit page 13, I was definitely feeling it. That’s when I came across a strange link:

“Puppy Bowl Greatest Plays” or “The Truth Behind the Uncanny Valley.”

I chuckled and said, “Let’s do it.” Needless to say, it wasn’t the Puppy Bowl.

It linked to a plain webpage with just a video player — no title, no description. Still in the spirit of the game, I clicked play. A cold, mechanical voice began narrating the four-minute video:

“The Uncanny Valley is a theory introduced in 1970 by Masahiro Mori, a Japanese robotics expert. It describes the relationship between how human-like something appears, and how we emotionally respond to it.”

A graph appeared on the screen as the voice continued.

“The most unsettling point is at the bottom of the valley — when something looks almost human, but something is… off.”

A few AI-generated images and robotic faces flashed across the screen. They weren’t grotesque, but something about them made me deeply uneasy.

“It’s normal to feel discomfort or fear when you see images like these. But where does that fear come from?”

Suddenly, the page glitched and started to freak out — flashing distorted images of AI art. The voice came back, but it no longer sounded robotic. It sounded… human, but wrong. Just slightly off.

“The fear is primal. It comes from a deep, ancient part of your species’ memory. An evolutionary response to something that looked human… but wasn’t. Something dangerous.”

“What the fuck is this?” I muttered, frantically clicking the close button — but the video wouldn’t stop.

“We’ve always been here,” the voice said. “A random face in the crowd. And you never notice. But when you do… you look away. You keep walking.”

Panic rising, I held down the power button on my desktop. The voice cut off mid-sentence, but not before the screen flashed one final image: a video feed from my own webcam.

It showed me — but the face on the screen was smiling. The smile was wide, too wide, with porcelain-white teeth that were eerily straight.

Shaking, I poured a glass of whiskey to steady my nerves and went to bed… but I was up and down all night. 
 
        
I wish I could tell you that the night ended there—a scary video and a panic attack, washed away by a pint of Jack. But I’d be lying if I said that was all.

The next morning, I woke up nursing a brutal hangover on top of barely any sleep. My eyes burned, the bitter, sour taste of bile clung to the back of my throat, and my head pounded like a war drum. I knew I needed to eat, but I had zero motivation to cook. Eventually, I mustered the strength to get dressed and stumble down to the local deli.

I ordered my usual: sausage, egg, and cheese with a hashbrown tucked in, plus a black coffee. The cashier stared at me—probably because I looked like hell—but said nothing, just rang me up. A few minutes later, she called my name. I stepped up to grab my sandwich, and she was staring again.

Uncomfortable, I tried to break the tension. “Sorry, I’m kind of a mess. Had a long night.”

She blinked and suddenly seemed to snap out of it. “Oh! I’m sorry, sir. I don’t know why, but I could’ve sworn I served you earlier this morning. Weird. Anyway, have a great day!”

She brushed it off and returned to the register like nothing had happened.

If I weren’t so hungover, I might’ve asked her what she meant. But I felt like death, and I knew if I didn’t get food in me fast, I’d redecorate the deli floor. So I made a beeline for my apartment. And that’s when things started to get weird again.

My computer monitor was off—but the webcam light was on.

How long had it been like that? Had it ever turned off? Was it recording?

I reached to unplug it, bumping the desk in the process. The screen flickered on. My stomach dropped.

“What the hell is going on!?” I yelled.

The video was still playing.

That same face—way too close to the camera—filled the screen. It began speaking again, completely unfazed:

“Your brain has two options. The first is to try to make sense of it. This often presents as déjà vu, or a vague feeling that you’ve seen something before, even though you haven’t.”

It paused.

The silence dragged on—long enough to make my skin crawl.

Then it continued.

“The second option is fear. Most will call it paranoia, or maybe agita. A vague discomfort at seeing a stranger you think you recognize. They’re the smart ones.”

It smiled then.

That awful, hideously perfect porcelain smile—impossibly white teeth, too many of them.

“My question for you is this: next time you see one of us, how will you respond? Will you fear us… or brush us off, like that cute girl at the deli? Oh well, we won’t have to wait much longer to find out…”

It chuckled, and the screen cut to black. Then it rebooted to a blue screen.

All I could hear was the pounding of my heart, thudding like it was trying to escape my chest. ",5,1753919337.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

One one hand, smoking is a stimulant, similar to coffee, that may or may not be helpful with managin IBS.  
Then there's the calming effect of nicotine on the nerve system. Which seems to be the primary culprit for IBS issues. But could the same be achieved with nicotone patches?

And then there's weed, which has an ever stronger ""soothing"" effect. In fact, I recall it having quite an extraordinary effect on my gut when I did occasionally smoke it. But it's been a while and I can't confirm or test it.",1,1753919284.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

After a bit of research, I ended up downloading Tandem, which turned out to be surprisingly good for meeting people who just want to chat or grab a coffee. The vibe felt more relaxed than other apps I’ve tried, and I got matched with a few locals who were into casual hangouts rather than pressure-filled dates.

One thing I really liked was how the app has a language exchange feature, so even though my Turkish was rusty, it gave me a chance to practice while talking to people. I had some fun conversations with folks who were just as excited about learning new languages as I was about meeting new people.

It wasn’t perfect, some profiles were a bit too eager to dive into deep convos, but overall, it felt like a good balance of laid-back and genuine. Anyone here had a similar experience or found a better app for a chill time in Istanbul?",1,1753919145.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False

I’m about to hit my 5 month mark for my job. While I like the team and the people I work with, I just know this scope of work isn’t for me long term. I don’t even see a long term future here because I’m not interested in how the role will progress (people management is usually the only option). 

I coffee chatted with a hiring manager for this desired role (got filled by the time I asked) a month ago and he flagged it to talent management who eventually told my manager. She felt blindsided that I didn’t tell her but I didn’t know I had to because i didn’t even apply for the role. Our relationship got kind of awkward afterwards. In general, my relationship with my manager is okay, she’s very hands off and lets me do my own thing but we are not very close. She said she would endorse me if I do want to be put on the internal transfer pipeline but I’m not sure she’s the best person to endorse me because she doesn’t even know me. I work closely with a different manager on my team but unfortunately I don’t report to her so she can’t do anything for me. 

Question is: when and how should I tell my manager? 

More context: last time I said I didn’t want to be put on the pipeline because there wasn’t an opening on the other team now so it seems like I’m backtracking?

I can't even stand 2-3 days without eating sweets. I once tried to not eat sweets but I got back eating them on day 2, it's hard asf. I don't function properly unless I eat it.

Without sweet i can't think properly, but with it, i can use my full power (coffee or extra strong tea, causes brain to be on steroid)

My sister is a weird creature, she don't like to eat any good stuff that I like to eat, she infact find some of them disguisting (even some world class dishes) and I be like dude seriously??? She likes to eat disguisting things tho, I would puke if I eat.

I don't relate with people who don't like sweets(atleast on sweet). She don't even have any emotions for colours, she has no favourite colour even lmao she's like all are same nothing stands out. 

I've seen people puke out sweet because it was too sweet. actually it was a very popular sweet desert (one of my favourites) and that girl put it in mouth and puke it out because it was too sweet, she was Japanese I guess.

Somewhere reasonably affordable and safer all around with people and the wildlife. 
Obviously I understand there’s a lot of bears and cougars out there but maybe an area where they are not too crazy. 
Somewhere that doesn’t get any colder than maybe 45° tops in the winter. I resonate with more of an artsy spiritual vibe.
I would love to find a place with similar open-minded friendly people. 
Obviously, I love nature and would love to be close to some hidden gems that only the locals would really know about. There’s a lot of small parks and swimming holes near me that not a lot of people know much about and I would love to find an area like that where I could go explore quietly if you don’t mind sharing.

1mdm59v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmerExit/comments/1mdm59v/experiences_with_recent_move_to_new_zealand/,Experiences with recent move to New Zealand,"I’m an American doctor who recently relocated to New Zealand with my two teens. We have been here a week and a half and I have a few observations and recommendations.

First, I used Accent Health Recruitment and was happy with their service. I originally contacted them ~8 years ago after we fell in love with New Zealand. I met with a consultant while on a visit in June 2017. For family reasons I reluctantly decided not to move at that time. 

A year ago I began seriously thinking about it again. I contacted Accent and was given same consultant I had met with 8 years ago. You won’t pay anything for their services. The government pays them a fee once you are in your job. I know there are people who have successfully done the professional registration, job search and contract negotiations by themselves. I’m not sure I could have pulled that off on my own.

Whether you do it through a firm or on your own make sure you have a good printer/scanner/copier. One that has an auto feed that will allow you to scan 15-20 page documents. Everything is done online or via email, which is really nice! But you will need to upload long documents and I went to FedEx office twice to do this because my simple printer could only scan and upload one page at a time. I eventually bought a better printer halfway through the paperwork.

If you plan on bringing your pets get started early because it is a big process. Check if your vet’s office has a USDA veterinarian certified to do international work. If not you will have to find one. You will have to use a pet transport service (our vet’s office requires clients use a service). I used Starwood Pet Travel and was very happy with them. They communicated directly with our vet’s office on timing of visits (there are many!) bloodwork, vaccinations, and parasite treatments. On our last visit our vet told us that the communication with Starwood was excellent. She strongly implied this isn’t always the case with other service providers .

Our two dogs flew out on the same flight as we did (into Auckland). After arrival they went to Pet Haven quarantine kennel for 10 days. We picked them up yesterday and they are curled up next to me right now. Pet Haven was wonderful—sent me daily photos and updates. One dog lacks a tear duct in one eye and needs eye drops and ointment 2-3 times a day. Her eye looked great when we picked her up. For comparison the last time we boarded her for vacation her eye lid was crusted with discharge when we picked her up.

The process was expensive. For two small dogs the transportation/travel was ~$14,000 for flights, kennels, paperwork/import certificates, and last vet appointment 2 days before departure at a vet’s office near the airport. I spent an additional ~$1,200 for the vet visits, shots, tests and medications.

For housing I found very few rentals online. Most will not accept pets. And of those almost none were in decent shape from the photos they posted online—stained carpet, mildew in bathrooms 😬. So I contacted the medical staff office at the hospital and they put me in touch with someone who had a furnished vacation rental they wanted to get a longer term tenant into. The unit is older and small but it is clean and comfortable. It was really nice to be able to be in our own place right after arrival and not have a transition period of being in an AirBnB for a month. Rent is expensive and is paid weekly—with a 3 week security bond paid upfront—but less than what I was paying back in the U.S. Though I am grateful to have had an immediate landing spot for us, I’m eager to buy a house and plan to within a year.

Before we arrived I set up a bank account online with a New Zealand bank. You can transfer money into it but can’t withdraw funds or make payments from it until you activate it. The day after we arrived in Auckland our first stop was a bank branch where I activated the account and received a temporary debit card. I had brought $500 USD cash and exchanged it for NZD at the airport so we would have cash in a the-debit-card-readers-are-down situation.

I reserved what I thought would be a minivan for pick up at the airport since we had 7 checked bags, 3 carry on roller bags and 3 full backpacks. I was given a Hyundai Staria. It goes down as the worst driving experience in my life. It is a big, clunky van that is extra tall and has a long wheelbase that makes navigating tight turns near impossible. My son said it looked like an Amazon delivery truck. It was so tall it wouldn’t fit into the garage at our hotel. I wound up parking in a public garage a few blocks away and it was extremely difficult to get it in and out of the garage. I’m talking having one of the kids outside giving me hand directions to make sure I didn’t cause damage. If you rent a minivan specify you do not want a Staria or any of the tall models. They have Kia Carnivals on the lot and that was what we rented in the U.S. for our trip to the airport.

For cell phones our U.S. carrier is Verizon. Almost all of the other doctors where I’m at use Spark. So that’s who I went with. I have an iPhone 15 and the kids have older iPhones. They were able to use an eSIM so we have both our new NZ and old U.S. numbers on our phones. Next month I will remove the kids’ phones from the Verizon plan—they should have updated all friends with their new numbers. WhatsApp is widely used here so I’m encouraging the kids to use this to communicate with friends back in the U.S. I’m not sure how long I will keep my U.S. number. For bank purposes I can use my oldest son’s number or park my number with a service. Our cell service will wind up being cheaper here than in the U.S. Internet costs are the same. 

Since we had to travel back to the Auckland area (~3 hours away) to fetch the dogs from quarantine we went up 2 days earlier to buy a car (and dump the Staria). I decided to go with a Mazda since I had one in the U.S. and am familiar with the controls. That way I can focus on staying on the correct side of the road instead of trying to figure out the rear window defogger while driving. I found 7-8 potential cars on AutoTrader and TradeMe and set up times to test drive 5 of them. I went with a car from a dealership that direct imports low km (mileage) used cars from Japan. Used cars cost much less here than in the U.S. Petrol/gas costs a lot more.

We did go to the Costco in Auckland while up there (I have a membership from the U.S.) and prices on several grocery items were much cheaper than at the two grocery store chains. We bought eggs, butter, skippy peanut butter (my daughter is an addict), coffee, and a few other items. I plan on going by there whenever we are in Auckland.

It’s hard to tell if my overall grocery bill will be more than what I was spending in the U.S. Groceries are expensive here. But they are expensive in the U.S. as well. When I did a mock grocery order on the Woolworth’s app a few months back the cost as compared to Walmart and Safeway 
were about the same. 

Eating out is expensive. Likewise it’s expensive in the U.S. We will adjust how we cook at home and eat out in the coming year to keep costs down as much as possible. We miss some of the restaurants and food brands from back in the U.S. When you go to a U.S. branded restaurant the menu is different (Taco bell does not have bean and cheese burritos) and what is listed as the same (taco supreme) tastes different. Same for groceries—my kids say the Pringles chips are thicker and the Doritos taste different. By the way, Bluebird Chicken Chips are awesome!  I tell the kids we will find new favorite foods and new favorite restaurants.

As for the people. Almost everyone has been friendly and curious about our immigration story. We had to get new glasses for my daughter since her’s broke the day before we flew out. The lady who took care of us at the optical store moved to NZ 20 years ago from South Africa. On the plane I was next to a woman with a Kiwi accent. I found out she had moved to NZ from the U.S. 40 years ago to marry her hubby she had met at college. The people at the car dealership said there weee a lot of Americans coming through lately. Especially retired military. The finance lady said how “a lot of Americans are looking to leave” and that a lot of New Zealanders were likewise leaving for Australia due to the poor job market and high COL. We talked about the high cost of groceries and about how in NZ and the U.S. the market is controlled by 2-3 large grocery store chains.

We do have pangs of homesickness. And I had a cry when I the Internet plugs wouldn’t fit into the sockets at the house AND I realized I would have to buy a clothes dryer. But the evening news is so. . . normal. Stories about local sports teams and local businesses. Government ministers get grilled by reporters and follow up questions are asked. When a public official says something that is untrue, they get called out—immediately. 

I know this was a tome! I start work and kids start school next week. As we settle in and learn more I will post about it.

It's pretty clear that most real estate agents in Australia have a massive bias towards landlords, often at the expense of following actual rental laws and protecting tenant rights.

**The root of the problem: follow the money.** Real estate agents work for landlords, not tenants. Their commission, repeat business, and livelihood depend on keeping property owners happy. We're just the inconvenient people living in ""their"" properties who occasionally complain about things like black mould, broken appliances, or illegal rent increases.

Here's what I've noticed they consistently get away with.

**Discrimination that's straight-up illegal** \- Despite laws in every state prohibiting discrimination based on race, age, disability, family status, and source of income (like Centrelink), agents routinely reject applications from people with kids, single parents, those on government benefits, with pets, or minorities. They just don't say it directly. Instead you get ""we've gone with another applicant"" or suddenly the property is ""no longer available"" even though it keeps getting advertised.

**Ignoring maintenance and repair laws** \- Agents will drag their feet on urgent repairs, ignore tenant requests for months, or straight up refuse to fix things that are legally required. Then when tenants complain or take it to tribunal, suddenly they're difficult tenants who might get rent increases or ""not have their lease renewed.""

**Bond theft through dodgy exit conditions** \- The amount of agents who try to claim entire bonds for ""cleaning"" (even when you've had it professionally cleaned) or ""damages"" that are clearly normal wear and tear is insane. They know most tenants won't fight it because it's time-consuming and they're scared of being blacklisted.

**Privacy violations** \- Entering without proper notice, showing up unannounced, taking photos during inspections without permission, or demanding access at unreasonable times. All of this is illegal but they do it anyway because they know most tenants won't know their rights or won't complain.

**The blacklist threat** \- This is their nuclear option. Threaten to blacklist difficult tenants (i.e., those who dare to know their rights) to keep people quiet. Even though there are laws about how tenant databases can be used, the fear is real and agents know it.

**What makes this worse is that real estate agents need basically no training.** You can get licensed in some states in just a few days. Meanwhile a barista making your coffee has more training than someone managing million-dollar properties and people's homes.

**The system is designed to protect property investments, not people's right to decent housing.** When agents ignore maintenance requests, it's because fixing things costs the landlord money. When they discriminate, it's because they think certain tenants are ""riskier"" for the landlord's investment. When they violate privacy laws, it's to make landlords feel like they have control over ""their"" property.

**The real kicker?** Most of this stuff is actually illegal. There are laws protecting tenants from discrimination, requiring proper notice for entry, mandating reasonable timeframes for repairs, and regulating how bonds can be used. But these laws are barely enforced, and agents know that most tenants either don't know their rights or are too scared to fight back.

**We need to start calling this out more.** Document everything in writing (never take phone calls from agents), know your state's rental laws, report breaches to the relevant authorities, and stop being afraid to complain. The housing crisis has made agents even more brazen because they know desperate tenants will put up with anything.

Anyone else noticed how agents suddenly become experts on ""landlord rights"" but seem to know nothing about tenant rights that are literally written into law? It's almost like they're deliberately trained to prioritise one over the other...

What are your experiences with agents who seem to think landlord preferences trump actual legislation? More importantly, how do we change it instead of waiting around?

*Note: Just to be clear, I know there are some decent agents out there, but the systemic issues with the industry make the bad ones way too common. And yes, I know landlords have rights too, but they shouldn't come at the expense of tenants' legal rights.*

## Key Features Analysis

the best iPhone 12 Pro Max wallet cases boast a range of features designed to enhance both functionality and protection. The following specifications are crucial when evaluating a wallet case in 2025.

**Card capacity:** The number of cards a case can securely hold is a basic consideration. Top-tier cases typically accommodate between 3 to 6 cards, offering sufficient space for IDs, credit cards, and transit passes. The design of the card slots is crucial too, ensuring easy access without compromising security.

The card capacity refers to how many physical cards can be safely and easily stored into the wallet case. It must be enough to cover basic needs – ID, several credit cards, and possibly a transit card. A good wallet case needs to strike a perfect balance between how many cards it can hold and the overall thickness it adds to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Too few, and it is indeed functionally useless. Too many, and it reduces the benefits of having a “wallet” case.

**Material Quality:** The materials used in the construction of the wallet case directly impact its durability and aesthetic appeal. Premium wallet cases frequently enough utilize genuine leather, known for its supple texture and long-lasting quality. Polycarbonate (PC) and Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) are also common materials, providing excellent impact resistance and shock absorption.

Material quality for a wallet case means the outer materials that create the product's appearance combined with the inner materials that protect the iPhone 12 Pro Max. High-quality, genuine leather is favored for its aesthetics, durability, and soft touch. TPU or PC is equally crucial for the inner section that is in direct contact with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, providing shock protection and preventing scratches. A suitable inner lining can also contribute to protecting the stored cards.**RFID blocking:** With the increasing prevalence of contactless payment technologies, RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking has become an essential feature. This technology prevents unauthorized scanning of your credit cards, protecting your financial information from digital theft. Effective RFID blocking is a critical component of a secure wallet case.

RFID blocking is a method employed by wallet cases to block scanners from stealing card information. All contactless cards transmit radio frequencies that allow touchless reading of your information. This makes it easy for thieves with wireless scanners to steal card data, wich is why wallets now need to contain an RFID-blocking layer.

**kickstand Functionality:** Some wallet cases incorporate a built-in kickstand, allowing you to prop up your iPhone 12 Pro max for hands-free viewing of videos, video calls, or browsing the web. This feature enhances the versatility of the case,making it ideal for both personal and professional use. The kickstand shoudl be sturdy and adjustable for optimal viewing angles.

A kickstand allows users to set the iPhone 12 Pro Max in landscape orientation, so it can be propped up on flat surfaces for hands-free viewing. Kickstands can come in various designs and levels of adjustment, but the most important aspect is stability. A good kickstand must keep the heavy iPhone 12 Pro Max and the added weight of a wallet case from tipping over.

Key features of the iPhone 12 Pro Max wallet case include:

* Secure card storage
* Durable construction
* RFID protection
* Hands-free viewing

1mdlxth,https://i.redd.it/sahe25qsi3gf1.png,Easy Chocolate Croissant Breakfast Bake,"Alright, so I have to tell you about my recent deep dive into breakfast biscuit recipes. It all started when I had some blueberries that were juuust about to go bad, and I didn’t want to waste them. Enter: blueberry biscuits. I’d never made them before, but I figured, how hard could it be? Spoiler alert: not hard at all. Turns out, an easy blueberry biscuit recipe is a game-changer for lazy weekend mornings or when you just want something warm and comforting with your coffee.



Check out the full recipe here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/east-coast-shrimp-rolls/#tasty-recipes-18481-jump-target](https://www.amgroyal.com/east-coast-shrimp-rolls/#tasty-recipes-18481-jump-target)

What I’ve learned, though, is that the quality of your ingredients totally makes or breaks this. If you’ve got really good blueberries (like the fresh, sweet ones you’d eat straight out of the carton), it takes these fluffy blueberry biscuits to another level. Oh, and don’t skimp on the butter. The buttery, flaky texture is kind of the whole point, right?



Here’s my little secret: keep the dough cold. Like, throw everything in the fridge if you have to. Colder dough makes the biscuits puff up beautifully, and nobody wants flat, sad biscuits. Also, be gentle—overworking the dough is a rookie mistake I learned the hard way.



Oh, and here’s a fun fact: blueberry biscuits apparently have Southern roots, though I’m no historian. Something about combining the region’s love for flaky, buttery baking with the abundance of berries. Makes sense, and honestly, I’m just grateful someone thought it up.



For me, these homemade blueberry biscuits just hit different because they remind me of summers at my grandma’s house. We’d pick fresh berries from the bushes in her backyard and make everything from pies to muffins. I like to think she would’ve loved this recipe (and probably given me a hard time for buying blueberries instead of picking them myself).



Ever made something like this? Would you throw in lemon zest or something to kick it up a notch? Let me know—I’m always looking for an excuse to make them again.",1,1753918073.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False
1mdlx7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1mdlx7r/23_m4f_online_hi_old_soul_country_guy_who_enjoys/,"23 [M4F] #Online - Hi! Old soul, country guy who enjoys the more rural farm life and who's favorite season is Autumn is looking for a woman interested in forming a genuine intimate connection with me! 🍁","Hi!

In a world where people are increasingly antisocial and absorbed into their devices, it makes it extremely hard to meet people. I smile at people or say hello and most don't even respond, or seem surprised that someone would say hi to them. I wanted to try on here. If you like a long read, this one's for you! 

I'm currently at work tonight cleaning a coffee machine and wanted to try and make a connection.

I am a very easy going 23 year old man. I was born and raised in IL on a small one acre farm in a little farmhouse where I currently still live. I've had a normal, stable, quiet upbringing. My family lives a quiet life as well. I don't have any mental or physical health issues and I've had a pretty quiet life. I'd love to hear about you as well! :) Lately I've been enjoying the simple things in life the most. It just gets a little lonesome at times. I work full time and didn't go to college because the pandemic delayed me after HS. 

I absolutely love autumn, and in the midst of this summer heat and humidity, there's nothing I want more than a crisp and windy November day. I was born the day before Halloween, so October and November are my favorite times of year. I love to sit by my fire pit outside and listen to the crackle of the fire amongst the sound of the wind blowing through the leaves. I love the cool and damp weather, no bugs, and staying warm and cozy. 🍁 I hope to meet a woman who loves Autumn as much as me!

Physically I'm male, 6 feet tall, white pale skin, average healthy weight, dark brown hair, wears glasses, handsome. I'll just say this now. If you're going to disappear after I send a picture of me please don't even bother. At least have the decency to say goodbye and that things didn't work out. Nevermind. People just don't have the social skills to do that anymore apparently. They just ghost. Don't be like them. Please send more than just a hey, thanks. 

I'm looking to get to know a woman around my age or older so 18-30+ is fine with me. Any ethnicity and POC are welcome as well as any body type as I am very non judgemental and open minded and I am a decent human being :)

I am looking for someone interested in forming a genuine online emotional connection as well as being able to connect sexually and tease and flirt and enjoy each other when we reach a point of feeling comfortable. Whether that is a long term intimate connection or a romantic relationship is up to you, but I am single so I don't mind dating. I'm very loyal and loving and I don't just do meaningless connections. Communication is important to me and I'll always be mindful of your boundaries and feelings. I would say I have a fairly high sex drive, and I love to share intimacy with someone special and make them feel satisfied. I'm pretty open sexually as well. I'm really hoping for that spark, where I leave you eager to hear from me and where we message each other often when we can. 

I guess I'm just at a point in my life where I really lack connection and really want someone to become close to, emotionally and sexually. It's been a rough patch for me the past few years since I'm working the afternoon shift and I don't get to meet women very easily, so it's been a few years for me since I've had any kind of intimate relationship. Please be open to long term and don't ghost me after a day, thanks. Sometimes you have to be blunt.

Anyone of any body type is welcome because I like making everyone feel comfortable being themselves. I don't agree with our society saying that women need to all be a supermodel to be attractive, that just isn't the case. Everyone is beautiful. You don't have to wear makeup or buy expensive cosmetics to be beautiful. I wish more guys were accepting like that. Social media is so horrible for the mental health of people. You'll always be accepted for who you are by me. It's sad that there are guys out there who try and shame people for who they are and tell them they need to be different. Every woman deserves to know they are beautiful and accepted for who they are, inside and out. :)

Now for some more about me.

I work full time during the week as a building maintenance tech at a corporation and I rather enjoy my job. I have weekends off. When I'm not at work, I'm typically relaxing at home. Growing up it was always quiet because my family prefers to stay at home and we never really did too much as a family. My father is older and retired before I was born because of a back injury and my mom wanted to stay at home. I really enjoy the simple things and I'm not very into parties or drinking heavily and all of that or really big social crowds. I like small concerts and things like that. I'm not into anime or much gaming or social media/pop culture so if you are, sorry as i don't think we would vibe too well. I do like cozy games like Minecraft and Stardew Valley though. I'm definitely not a ""gamer"" though. I just didn't grow up with pop culture stuff nor did I keep up with it into adulthood so I'm just not very into all that. 

My dream one day is to have a beautiful old farmhouse with a wrap around porch and an acre or two of farmland to really enjoy nature, and possibly have a small homestead and garden. The house must have a fireplace. 😂 I'm honestly kind of a modern day hippie in a sense in that I kind of strongly dislike modern tech and AI and all this nonsense that everyone is pushing now. Life is so complex and I don't like the direction that things are going in regards to AI and social media and people being so absorbed in their devices and expected to be available constantly or getting information constantly. I love a more peaceful rural life, relaxing here in my bed listening to older music and enjoying my Lava lamps. The simple things are so nice and far less stressful in a world that's so complex now. 

Ideally, I'd love to find a woman who also likes the farmhouse and homestead kind of life but that's not a requirement of course. 

Some of my interests are photography, nature walks, bird photography and wildlife, camping, cooking and baking, listening to music, the outdoors, relaxing and being comfy, aviation and flight simulation, technical stuff, fixing things and being handy, candles and incense, and animals. i could live in a tiny cabin in the woods with a wood stove or wood burning fireplace and be happy. 🤣🍁🏠 I'm a very peaceful person and quite the homebody. Lately I've really been enjoying woodwick candles because of their crackle. If you like candles, tell me your favorite scent in your message.

I have a couple of Nikon cameras and I really enjoy photography as one of my main hobbies! It's relaxing to me. I don't really watch many movies or shows, but I'm really big into music. I love listening to my favorite bands from the 60s, 70s, and 80s And present day. Lots of live recordings too. 

There's a really cool place a few hours from me called Wildlife Prairie Park and I stayed there a few months ago and was able to take some nice wildlife photography!

I am a pretty well rounded person and I'm always respectful and kind. I'll always be mindful of your feelings and boundaries, especially with anything more intimate as it's important to me. 

If I seem like someone you'd like to connect with, then I'd love to hear from you.",1,1753918028.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Pra quem nao conhece, o Pepe Jijón é um dos plantadores de café de maior renome do mundo, a fazenda dele (Finca Soledad - Ecuador) é basicamente uma floresta, a ideia dele é conciliar o crescimento do café com a vegetação natural e o resultado fica evidente no copo: Um café lavado extremamente limpo e suculento, mesmo tendo sido preparado na aeropress com o attachment de bico pressurizado.

Sobre preço, foi o café mais caro que já tomei: 25 dólares, mas valeu cada centavo. Por fim de curiosidade,  a SEY divulga o preço do grão verde de cada um dos seus cafés, os mais caros costumam ser entre 5 e 8 dólares o kilo, já esse custava 100 dólares o kilo.

We go to the same college, we have the same friend group, we study together and such…and somewhat I started to like him.

He isnt the greatest, tallest, or most handsome. He is just him. And I like that. I started doing make up and caring about my hair and such. Because every Monday at 10AM I knew I would see him. We texted, we sent each other reels, we talked a lot in the VC until late.

And suddenly…things change. He chills more around other girls that arent really the nicest but they are pretty. Way prettier. They have the same major and he helps them out with studying.

I say stuff like „I have you to do xy for me“, he agrees, „You‘ll be my motivation“ and he agrees again. He asks me what my ideal first date would be, when my exams are over and such. He jokes around that he pays for my food and such and I chuckle.

But he is distant. If the other girls are there he talks to them while smiling and laughing. He sometimes turn red and I still couldnt see if his pupils dilate with them (I know I am smitten). And when asked he says they are mostly cool. During my presence he‘d say when a girl is hot and say „Well I gotta get some coffee“ since the girls always sit in the cafe. When asked he says „You dont get it“ or „I can find girls pretty but not be attracted to them“

I wish he‘d do that with me. I wish he‘d be more shy and such. But no, he calls me bro and such. I wish he‘d ask stuff about me, text me and such. But when I text him recently his replies are dry and just one word.

I fear he likes one of the other girls. And I dont know how I could live with that. I like him, but I fear he doesnt like me. If a guy would like me, he wouldnt let me be confused, would he?

I cant tell this anyone. My friends find him weird, his friends are a no go either and my family or other friends arent really an option. I feel like I need to get this off my chest but I dont really have an option to tell him since I dont wanna risk the friendship.

Well got this off my chest once. But it wont be the last probably, who knows.",1,1753917987.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

1mdlsj6,https://i.redd.it/p4wsudrfh3gf1.png,Fluffy Blueberry Biscuits Recipe,"Alright, so I have to tell you about my recent deep dive into breakfast biscuit recipes. It all started when I had some blueberries that were juuust about to go bad, and I didn’t want to waste them. Enter: blueberry biscuits. I’d never made them before, but I figured, how hard could it be? Spoiler alert: not hard at all. Turns out, an easy blueberry biscuit recipe is a game-changer for lazy weekend mornings or when you just want something warm and comforting with your coffee.

Check out the full recipe here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/blueberry-biscuits-recipe/#tasty-recipes-18467-jump-target](https://www.amgroyal.com/blueberry-biscuits-recipe/#tasty-recipes-18467-jump-target)

What I’ve learned, though, is that the quality of your ingredients totally makes or breaks this. If you’ve got really good blueberries (like the fresh, sweet ones you’d eat straight out of the carton), it takes these fluffy blueberry biscuits to another level. Oh, and don’t skimp on the butter. The buttery, flaky texture is kind of the whole point, right?

Here’s my little secret: keep the dough cold. Like, throw everything in the fridge if you have to. Colder dough makes the biscuits puff up beautifully, and nobody wants flat, sad biscuits. Also, be gentle—overworking the dough is a rookie mistake I learned the hard way.



Oh, and here’s a fun fact: blueberry biscuits apparently have Southern roots, though I’m no historian. Something about combining the region’s love for flaky, buttery baking with the abundance of berries. Makes sense, and honestly, I’m just grateful someone thought it up.



For me, these homemade blueberry biscuits just hit different because they remind me of summers at my grandma’s house. We’d pick fresh berries from the bushes in her backyard and make everything from pies to muffins. I like to think she would’ve loved this recipe (and probably given me a hard time for buying blueberries instead of picking them myself).



Ever made something like this? Would you throw in lemon zest or something to kick it up a notch? Let me know—I’m always looking for an excuse to make them again.",1,1753917667.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

1mdlphc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1mdlphc/4_straight_days_awake_mystery/,4 straight days awake mystery,"Five years ago, I had an insane psychological experience of some kind. Apparently there are no documented cases of anyone experiencing anything like this anywhere, and I'm curious if anyone on this sub has experienced anything remotely similar or knows someone who did.

What follows is going to sound like a totally made-up horror story. I can’t stop anyone from insisting it’s made up, but I promise this is all 100% true. No part of this story is made up or exaggerated, even a little.

It all started in August 2020 when I was 16. It was the pandemic, though that didn’t make much of a difference for me.

Day 1:

I was sleeping when my mom came into my bedroom to wake me up, for some reason. When I opened my eyes to look at her, her face was incredibly deranged and horrifying, seeming to smile with her mouth upside down. She estimated I screamed for about 15 seconds all in the same breath, appearing not to know who she was. When I stopped screaming, I said, “what was that?” and she said, shaken, “I don’t know!” 

I said, “That was weird.”

So I got up and as I walked out into the kitchen where she was making coffee, I started telling her, “Wow, that was really strange! It was like I —UUU-WUHH-WUHH-WAHH . . . UU-UUU—UAHH! . . . AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! I’M OKAAAAAY!!!!! I’M OKAAAUUUAAAUUUUAY!!!!!! I’M OKQUAAOOOOOUUUUUUU … !!!!!”

What happened was, she turned and looked at me as I started to speak and when I saw her face, it was deranged again! I would look at her and the strings of my neck would start tugging these alarming sounds out of my voice and then I’d try to look away, but then for some reason I locked my eyes on hers in this cursed state of mind and screamed at her mangled face for another 15 seconds. I don’t know why I looked back at her after looking away. I tried to tell her I was okay, but the screams distorted my voice.

They weren’t ordinary screams, they felt like they were being controlled by something external to me, if that makes any sense. They sounded like my voice box would open wide to make this unnatural sound like I was possessed by demons or something. It felt like someone was fingering into my lungs and throat and forcefully grabbing my tissues, prying open my throat as wide as possible and ringing my lungs out like a dishrag to let out the biggest possible sound.

Then I went into the bathroom to take a shower and looked at myself in the mirror and let out another horrifying, blood-curdling scream and bolted out of the bathroom!

Everywhere I went, my face and her face looked psychologically deranged in a way I promise you cannot conceive of if you haven't experienced it. Family pictures of us, my reflections in appliances and any kind of reflective surface. No one else’s face—just mine and hers. 

That morning, we drove to the hospital to get COVID tests, and I tried not to look at myself or her. Sometimes I would accidentally catch a reflection in my eye and let out little “HUUUUUH!!!”s or “WHAAUA”s.

Then later that day, my mom had a Zoom appointment with her therapist who said it might have to do with the maca powder I mixed in my cereal combined with the coffee I drank or something, so she told her to tell me to stop eating maca powder. I wasn’t taking any kind of drugs except Benadryl.

Day 2:

Then that night, I was laying awake for a long time before I fell asleep, thinking about things, like I did every night. Then around quarter after midnight I felt this feeling come on that felt very lonely and I wasn’t falling asleep. My heart kept beating slowly faster and faster and I couldn’t control it or ignore it no matter how hard I tried to entertain myself with my thoughts. I started to feel like I did when I was in Kindergarten and I would get scared of the creepy night and eventually, after a long time of laying frozen in bed, take a deep breath and hurry through the scary dark house to go sleep with my parents.

Then, at 1:45 AM, something else mysterious happened. I felt my body roll itself out of my bed onto my feet without my command, then my lungs started screaming themselves again, tickling my voice box, and my fist started slamming itself against the door over and over so hard it sounded like gunshots, all of it being orchestrated by something that felt like it wasn't me. I wasn’t doing any of these things—my muscles just contracted and moved themselves as I witnessed them go, confused and afraid but not anything as horrified the involuntary screaming made me look from the outside. I wanted to get out of the bedroom but couldn’t because my body was so locked in on smashing my way through the door, and I couldn’t resist the involuntary movements. I tried to yell, “HELP! HELP!” through the contractions in my voice box, producing a deranged, horrific sound. When I stopped screaming, my dad asked, “what happened?”

Me: “My lungs collapsed in on themselves and pushed a scream out of them.”

I went back to bed and then a while later, the same thing happened except I didn’t roll out of the bed—just let my legs thrash themselves in the air while I controlled my upper body.

Dad: “Why don’t you just sit up and read for a while or something? This reminds me of something I read about night terrors.”

I sat up and read and it happened a third time while trying to read.

My dad ran in and yelled “STOP SCREAMING! STOP SCREAMING! STOP. SCREAMING! STOP. SCREAMING!” but I couldn’t stop screaming.

My mom, who didn’t hear the screams earlier because she was knocked out on Ambien, came into the hallway and asked, “what’s going on?”

“I’m not screaming, my lungs squeeze a scream out of me and I can’t help it. I feel normal while it’s happening.”

Dad: “Yes you can, take a deep breath or something. Read. Don’t just keep screaming all night.”

Me: “NO! You have to believe me! I can feel them contract by themselves, I’m not doing it.”

Dad: “I don’t know, that seems weird.”

So he goes off back to bed and says, talking to my mom zonked out on Ambien, “Honey, go back to bed.”

It happens a fourth time another five to ten minutes or so later.

My dad runs into my bedroom again, watching me melt down like a wicked demon, fervently gripping my body by my shoulders. The screams stop, and when he lets go of me, I fall over onto my bed shivering in a cold sweat, my whole skull buzzing and my ears ringing out several deep, loud tones at once—and I feel wonderful! I felt light as a cloud, blissful. I thought, “tomorrow’s gonna be a new day and this will all have just been a weird night.” 5 minutes later:

“OHHH-A! OHHH-*WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!*”

I was going through this rapid cycle between horrific doom and heavenly bliss. I’d scream, then I’d fall over in bliss, over and over and over again, and every time, I could feel the lava rising in the room as the minutes passed until I started screaming—and then I felt fine … I don’t remember enough to describe how I felt when I screamed, but the way my body was reacting by itself didn’t match my experience inside because I felt normal. Then I’d fall over again and drift away into a cloud. 100 bliss, 100 doom, scream. Repeat. It felt like the lonely feeling would grow and then I would throw it up and feel better. And it didn’t slow down until sunrise. I never slept that night.

“What’s happening when you’re screaming like that?” My dad asked, “What’s going through your mind?”

“I get this eerie feeling, I feel lonely. It reminds me of when I was little trying to sleep in my dark room afraid of monsters under my bed and you and mom were all the way across the house. It gets gradually worse, slowly, painfully, until my heart is beating rapidly and the area around my jugular veins are burning and beating with big pulses of blood, and then my lungs start screaming me. When that starts happening, I go back to feeling completely normal. Then when it stops, I feel good—but only for a minute until the loneliness comes back on.”

I said again and again, “I must have mad cow disease! What else could it be? I must have one of those diseases that eats your brain! What else could it be?!” but the doctor said the next day on the phone that brain diseases are rare in young people. He gave the same advice as my mom’s therapist and we set up an appointment to get checked out later in the week.

Day 3:

The next evening was a repeat of the last.

Then at 2 AM, my mom asks,

“Would it help you if you slept in my bed tonight?” (On Ambien again)

“Yeah.”

So I walk across the house to her bedroom, cycling all the while. I’d been awake for 42 hours at this point.

“Won’t it startle you for me to scream next to you in bed all night?”

“It’s okay.”

“I’ll try to let you know when I feel it coming on.”

Just moments later: “EHH-UH!!! IT’S COOOAAAMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG! WAAAAAWAAAWAAAAA! OOOOUUUUOOOUUUU!!!!!”

And I screamed for a while, and then I told her, “I tried to say ‘it’s coming,’ but it was already too late!”

So I get under the covers. Then just when I thought these nights couldn’t get any more bizarre, something even weirder started happening. 

I was laying flat on my back under the covers with my legs straight down, my feet spread about as far apart as when you’re walking, and all the sudden a mysterious force sucked the muscles in my feet inward, forcefully clamping them together, and then it started slowly crawling up my calves and legs, locking them together while simultaneously releasing pressure from lower areas. Though uncomfortable, I could shift my legs to keep my knee bones from stabbing into each other. Then it would reach up to my waist, squeezing everything inward, then my belly and lower back, bending my upper body fully up off the mattress, then my lungs and voice box, screaming me again, and finally to my arms—raising them in the air like I was a puppet! It would curl my hand and fingers, sometimes folding my hand together, other times curling it into a fist, then releasing it and bending it backwards, over and over again. 

It happened again and again, in succession—waves of what looked like esophageal peristalsis crawling up my body, like big ridges of water about to fold and smack an ocean beach. It looked, and felt, surreal—my whole body looked like a dust mote bending around in a sunlit window, moving with vividly smooth motion in an unhuman way. My muscles tingled like crazy as each wave crawled smoothly up my body—gently, but with bite force, like a boa constrictor.

It lasted for maybe a minute and then my mom, sedated and delirious from her Ambien, said “mm mih meggh behh . . .” 

“What?”

“Gigginnn wimme mutter met . . .”

“What?”

“Come with me. Come with me. Mmumum pill . . .”

So I follow her into the kitchen and she starts opening drawers and pill bottles.

“I’ll give you one of my pillsssssss . . . maybe you just need a pill . . .”

The peristalsis starts again now and I’m standing up this time, by the kitchen/living room, wiggling like a used car inflatable. 

“No, Mom, I’m not taking any of your pills. They aren’t mine.”

As moments pass, the involuntary muscle movements worsen and after a while, I fall on the carpet, twisted all around like a pretzel, and the contractions are so powerful I can’t move or get up.

My dad comes out into the kitchen/living room area from his bedroom. “Honey, go to bed. No, Jaden’s not taking your pills. Go to bed.”

“Mih mih pill can get sleep . . .”

“I’ll take care of this, Honey.”

He takes my wrists and drags me across the floor to his bedroom as I’m writhing around on it uncontrollably, making loud, alarming sounds that would occasionally escalate to what looked from the outside like demonic meltdowns.

I stood up next to his bed, back to being an inflatable wiggly guy. 

“Try putting your arms down once. What happens?”

“I’m able to resist the movements now, but when I do, they tickle and it gives me an uncomfortable, scared feeling to move them against the will of the forces going through my muscles. It gives me a spooky feeling like I’m supposed to obey the movements.”

We talk about the movements for a while.

“What would you do if someone invited you to, say, stay up late and play video games? Would you do it if it meant you could hang out, or would you say ‘no’ just because it’s unhealthy?”

“Huh? No? Why do you ask?”

“Because I think this might be something anxiety-related.”

We spent the next two hours—until 4 AM—talking about everything: my life, friendship problems, school, etc. He asked me all kinds of questions about it, I think trying to get to the bottom of what could be eating me. Gradually, the muscle movements slowed down—but they were still there even two hours later, and still creepy as hell. It looked like parts of my body were *me*, but my arms, hands, and neck were seized by a separate, supernatural force—separate from *me*.

At 4 AM, they’d slowed down enough that I could climb into bed next to him. He went to sleep, but I spent the rest of the night lying awake with involuntary muscle contractions. I made softer “UU-U—U-U-U-UUUAHHUAHH!” sounds too, but no violent screaming for the rest of the night.

Day 3:

So now, I’d been awake for a full day, a full night, another full day, and then another full night—48 hours. All day long, I kept almost falling asleep every few minutes and then letting out a little ""UOAH!"" just as I was about to drift off, waking me back up! 

My mom and I went into urgent care that morning and they said to stop taking Benadryl and stop putting maca powder in my cereal, and they said it could very well have something to do with night terrors like my dad suggested or some other kind of sleep thing, but that I would for certain eventually fall asleep. Then they reassured me I would see the doctor the next day.

After that, a third full day and third full night passed. Screaming all night long again. Throughout all three nights, besides the screaming and muscle contractions, my visual perception of my surroundings was distorted: everything looked like a demon, or even a psychologically deranged face like my mom’s three days earlier, and I was very careful to avoid looking at my own. The refrigerator? A satanic tiki man with long handlebars for eyes and a bottom sliding freezer door for jaws! The recliner? A monster with a headrest head and armrest arms! Windows? Jackals with curtain-slider butts for ears and window-blinds for eyes! The coathanger? A robot with hangers for arms and a lamp for a head, wearing a coat! Toiletries and objects on the counters and tables? Creepy little beings with necks and caps for heads. Even the corners of the ceilings looked threatening and warped, like the areas where the walls and ceiling met were their own sets of mouths, noses, and eyes. One evening some days or weeks later, I accidentally looked at myself in the mirror in the bathroom and was so startled I flew back into the cupboard behind me and slammed it so hard it went <POW!>.

Day 4:

Finally, on the morning of my fourth straight day of uninterrupted wakefulness, it was time for the appointment with the doctor we’d set up. They said I probably had a substance in my system even though I wasn’t taking any kind of medications other than Benadryl. Ran four blood tests on me and a pee test. Days later, we got the test results back but nothing turned up. So my mom’s therapist recommended I see another therapist who worked at her counseling clinic who specialized in anxiety because she suspected I might be having panic attacks.

Day 5 & Later

Though I never missed any more nights of sleep after that, I still had major symptoms for a year or two after, the worst symptoms gradually fading away over many months and other symptoms persisting over years. I continued to sleep in my mom’s bedroom and couldn’t enter my own bedroom at all because it gave me such profound fear. Very often throughout the day, my hands would curl up into fists and it would be hard to unravel them. They would curl themselves up so tight they would start stabbing my fingernails into my palms and I had to try to use an object or my other hand if I could to pry my fists open. Then they’d uncurl themselves and try to peel my fingers backwards, then clamp again, then open, then shut, reversing every 5–20 seconds, and this would happen frequently throughout every day. I would grab onto whatever object was nearby so it would crush the object instead of stabbing by palms. Sometimes I’d be typing on my computer and my hands would randomly start curling, making it hard to type. My arms would often lift themselves up in the air, and though I could control their movements, it was uncomfortable to, same as on that night talking to my dad.

Every single night, I would have fearful perceptual distortions of my surroundings, though not anything as vivid as they were during the three consecutive nights I was awake. Involuntary screaming episodes remained common over the following year, occurring daily at first just after the “Three Nights” and then every few days, then every few weeks, then every few months, then not at all—but unlike during the Three Nights, they only happened in response to a startle. Everything startled me—sometimes I would yelp out a little shriek, other times I would scream bloody murder and sprint across the house with every nerve in my body reflexing all at once. I remember one night, I was doing my homework on my computer and something started ticking under the screen, and I SCREAMED and ran all the way across the house! Every time one of my parents and I would walk past each other in the hallway unexpectedly—“WAHHHHHHH!” Overall, I don't have many symptoms today. I still feel involuntary movements in my hands all the time, and there’s occasional gentle back-and-forth arm-twisting, torso-bending, or subtle neck movements at night too, but they’ve all become so subtle and easy to control that I barely think about them anymore.

So there doesn’t seem to be any cases out there of people experiencing anything like this that could help explain what happened. I thought Reddit might be a good last resort to look for answers.

TL;DR: It involved perceptual distortions of faces and perceiving scary faces in objects, involuntary muscle movements throughout my body causing screaming, and rapid cycling between euphoria and intense discomfort.",1,1753917449.0,Psychosis,1,1.0,False

I've been meaning to chat about a series that has really captured my heart lately: Abby Jimenez's ""The Friend Zone"" series. If you're looking for books that are a perfect blend of humor, deep emotions, and characters you'll genuinely root for, then you absolutely need to check these out. I've found a great resource for navigating them in order right here: [The Friend Zone Series In Order - Abby Jimenez](https://pdfhive.com/the-friend-zone-series-in-order/). It's really helpful to get started on your reading journey with this series.

***

**A Quick Series Scoop (No Spoilers, Promise!)**

So, ""The Friend Zone"" series isn't a continuous story with the same main characters throughout, but rather a collection of interconnected standalones. Each book focuses on a new couple, often friends of characters from previous books, allowing you to catch up with familiar faces while falling for new ones. They all dive into the complexities of modern relationships, personal challenges, and finding love in unexpected places. They're contemporary romance, but they tackle some pretty heavy topics with a light touch and a lot of heart.

***

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

*   **Characters You'll Adore:** Abby Jimenez is a master at crafting characters that feel incredibly real. They're flawed, they're funny, and they go through genuine struggles. Whether it's the quirky heroine with a love for dogs or the gruff but secretly soft hero, you just can't help but connect with them. I found myself thinking about them even when I wasn't reading.

*   **Emotional Depth and Heart:** This isn't just fluffy romance, folks. Jimenez isn't afraid to tackle serious subjects like grief, chronic illness, and infertility. What's amazing is how she handles these topics with such grace and empathy. You'll laugh out loud one minute and feel a lump in your throat the next. It’s a true emotional rollercoaster, but in the best possible way. Have tissues ready!

*   **Witty Banter & Laughs:** Despite the serious themes, these books are genuinely funny. The dialogue is sharp, the situations are often hilarious, and the banter between characters is top-notch. It balances the heavier parts beautifully, making the books feel real and hopeful.

*   **Pacing and Writing Style:** The stories move along at a great pace, keeping you engaged without ever feeling rushed or bogged down. Abby Jimenez's writing style is so approachable and conversational. It feels like she's just telling you a story over coffee, which makes it incredibly easy to get lost in the pages.

***

**A Little Balance: What Might Not Be For Everyone**

While I absolutely loved these books, I think it's fair to say that the emotional intensity might be a lot for some readers. If you prefer light, low-angst reads, these might challenge you a bit more. Also, like many contemporary romances, they do feature some common tropes, but in my opinion, they're executed really well and feel fresh.

***

**My Recommendation & Who It's For**

I wholeheartedly recommend ""The Friend Zone"" series! If you're a fan of contemporary romance, especially those with depth, humor, and genuinely relatable characters, you're in for a treat. It's perfect for anyone who enjoys crying happy tears (and maybe a few sad ones) while also laughing out loud. If you're new to romance or looking to try something with more substance than just a quick read, this series is an excellent starting point.

***

**A Little Advice for New Readers and Exploring Series**

For those just getting into reading, or if you're venturing into a new series like this, here are a few thoughts:

1.  **Start Chronologically:** With series that have interconnected standalones, it's usually best to read them in release order. It helps you understand the connections and enjoy the subtle nods to previous characters. You can find the order through helpful guides like [this one](https://pdfhive.com/the-friend-zone-series-in-order/).
2.  **Embrace the Emotions:** Don't be afraid to feel what the book wants you to feel. If a scene makes you laugh, laugh! If it makes you tear up, that's okay too. Reading is an experience, and sometimes the most impactful books are the ones that stir your emotions.
3.  **Take Your Time:** There's no rush to finish. If a book is particularly emotional or thought-provoking, it's perfectly fine to take breaks. Let the story sit with you.
4.  **Explore!** If you enjoy this series, it might open doors to other authors who write similar books. The world of books is vast and wonderful, and there's something out there for everyone. Don't hesitate to check out more books from authors you enjoy, and keep an eye on lists like [The Friend Zone Series In Order - Abby Jimenez](https://pdfhive.com/the-friend-zone-series-in-order/) for your next great read!

Fast forward 3 ish months ago my brother went through my google photos showed my parents intimate private pictures for me and my fiancé(us holding hands in public and him kissing my forehead or hand…etc), some other pictures with male friends, and pictures of me without hijab (which i don’t believe in nor in Islam but i still do have to wear it or i will be beheaded) anyways they did beaten me with a belt, spit on me, abused me in every possible way mentally and physically, i was fasting the whole day in Ramadan and they refused to give me food to break my fast they told me to sit in my room like a dog till they eat and finish then i can have their leftovers or something, I wasn’t allowed to get out of the house nor using my phone to call my long distance fiancé i was just sitting in my room like a dog and go to them every couple of hours for them to mentally abuse me, my mom even threatened me with a knife and told me to thank god my brother didn’t kill me because I’m a bitch, they took the ring my fiancé gets me too and threatened me They’re not going to let me marry him

4 months later (now)

I’m officially getting engaged like I’m making a party for the whole family (we do engagement parties in my country) so my fiancé is here for 2 weeks before travelling again, every time i want to go out with him my dad is making a drama of itttt like a big big Indian drama movie, why would you go outtttt???!!!!
Why are you asking for that?
My fiancé’s family are easy going (because he’s a male not because they’re mentally stable people or anything maybe they’re worse with their own daughters idk) so i always feel bad like why do i have to go through all this drama and if we go out it’s a fuckin 2 ish hours around my home and I’m always so heartbroken when I go out because of the drama they make and the toxic words they fed me like (don’t be a wh0re we know you wh0re we’re watching you) and even more that cant be translated into English because it doesn’t have an equivalent in English language 

So hours ago me, my fiancé, and one of his friends were going out for a cup of coffee and to know each other before the big party to break the ice, my dad knew about it and asked my fiancé to come home and make his friend wait for him (so rude i know) and scolded my fiancé, my dad told him to not introduce me to any of his male friends again we shouldn’t know each other (like out of jealousy and religious stuff) my fiancé told him politely that he understands his concerns and respects his opinion but he isn’t really convinced by it, the biggest problem issss i was panicking since the second i get home till the second he left, but what breaks my heart the most is my mother who knew his friend is coming since forever although she waited couple of minutes after we get there for coffee and told my father whom by himself spammed me and my fiancé with calls, messages and everything till we came back home, my fiancé is really very very understanding and supportive but i cant handle that anymore I forever dreamt to have a house for myself, a car, and to take off my hijab feeling the air on my neck and through my hair, I always tried to make it outside the house but it’s so not easy they would get me and kill me easily, so my plan is to marry my fiancé (on the papers) to make it to outside the country then do whatever i want where no-one can get me, i want to leave that house so baaaaadddd i want to marry as soon as possible i want to love, to live, to breathe, to be.. to be the person i forever was behind the curtains :(",3,1753916929.0,toxicparents,3,0.81,False

Hey, 
So I (24m) recently made the decision to end a long term (8 years) relationship but it's led to me losing my best friend too. 

For context me and my former partner shared the same friend group and the same best friend. Said friend has recently lost a loved one and is in an intense period of grieving. I've been checking in on them now and then trying to offer them support but they're not the type to open up about their feelings too much, at least to me anyway. We've known each other for 6 years but have never really had any truly deep emotional conversations as we both relied on other avenues for emotional support but I always thought we were really close. I moved away for a few months for uni in 2023 and in that time we had maybe around 2 conversations outside of group settings and only because I initiated them first. I came home to find my partner and my friend were much closer and I felt detached from both of them. 

We got closer again when I moved back home but never as close as before I moved away. I've been having a stressful time this year (severe depression and thoughts of not being alive any more)and relied on my partner and my uni friends who were going through the same stress to support me emotionally. However, I drifted away from my partner again and eventually fell out of love with her. I made the decision to end it after I realized I did not want to be in a relationship anymore and felt it was unfair to stay if I did not love her as much as I once did. However, in previous times of intense stress I had broken up with her only to realize it wasn't what I really wanted and we got back together a few hours after each time. I regret hurting her by doing this and I still feel really guilty about it so I wanted to be absolutely certain. Here comes the phone call.

It's around 1am, I had been debating whether I should call them all night but remembered that they had often said the cliché 'Im always here if you need me"" line. I thought it was true so I phoned and asked if we could meet. They replied and sounded pissed off and said ""I have work tomorrow."" I just said ""oh."" Not realizing that they wouldn't be willing to t least talk. He continued ""Did you not think about that?"". I said that I did but I was at a lost place and didn't know what to do. They asked if I was safe and I said yeah and they said ""well I have work so I can't help you"" and we both said goodnight and they hung up the phone. I felt really rejected by it because it was the biggest decision I have had to make in my life and needed their support but I also understood that work stuff does get in the way. I was about to go to sleep but then my phone rings. It's my partner and they're asking why I haven't spoken to them all day and why I rang out best friend out of the blue. The friend had told her out of concern that I was unsafe but ultimately it led to me having to break up with my partner over the phone rather than in person which I felt terrible about.

 A few days go by, our friend hears the news and initially reaches out to offer me to go get coffee and talk it out. When I try to make plans I don't hear from them and when my partner comes to pick stuff up from my house they're in the friends car. I wave hello and was glad that she had support during the breakup as I figured she needed it more than me but the way the friend looked at me was like I was a complete stranger. It felt odd and I felt rejected but tried focusing on other things. About 2 weeks go by and I haven't heard from anyone in the friend group and I ask them if they want to get coffee. They all tell me no very strongly and refuse to explain why. I go into the friend group chat and just ask why everyone hates me all of a sudden and my supposed best friend explodes and says that I was the most idiotic and selfish person ever for causing them so much stress. They said that I should have apologized for phoning and scaring them that I was going to do something bad because it put more stress on top of the things they had already been going through. They said that it shows that I think the world revolves around me and that it was unreasonable to think that they would ever be able to support me when they had other things going on. They asked what did I seriously think was going to happen, said that I disrespected them and their family by failing to take into consideration their loss and demanded an answer and an apology. Initially I apologized as I felt awful for hurting them but after thinking about it I'm not sure whether I did anything wrong. 

Was it unreasonable to expect support in this situation? Why was it reasonable for my former partner to ask for support and not me? ",1,1753916891.0,AITAH,0,0.67,False

I’m starting a “pop-up comedy club” in Des Moines! The club doesn’t have a fixed location; instead, we’ll be doing shows in unique venues all around the Des Moines metro. You can expect shows in coffee shops, bookshops, brunch spots, classrooms, and other unexpected places.

I’m originally from the Des Moines area, and I’m really excited to create another opportunity for people here to catch live shows featuring some of the best rising and national touring headliners in the country!

Unlike bigger chain clubs, you don't have to worry about overpriced drinks,  2 drink minimums, you get more intimate spacers for the shows, and the headliner gets paid a much higher split of the door since our expenses are less.

Today is the club’s ""public launch""! We only have a few shows listed right now, but I’m already in talks with more comics that I am beyond excited to bring to town. We’re still lining up venues and gauging interest based on ticket sales for the first few shows.

[https://speakeasycomedydsm.com](https://speakeasycomedydsm.com)

If you know anyone with a venue, please send them our way via the site!  
Also, I’m taking requests. Who do you want to see? What neighborhoods should we show in? Got questions, I will answer all of them!

If you want to help live comedy grow in Des Moines, *buying tickets early* really helps. If these first few shows start to sell well, we can add even more.
