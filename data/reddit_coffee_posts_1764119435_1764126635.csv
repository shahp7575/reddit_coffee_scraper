1p6wtts,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1p6wtts/i_hate_my_family_and_want_to_kill_myself/,I hate my family and want to kill myself,"I have been wanting to make this post for about a month or two now but have been scared to do so.

I’m 15M and my sister is 17F. My parents depicted her as the good sibling and me as the “bad one” all because she’s not autistic and I am. I generally try to avoid my family because every time I try to rationally converse with the whole family at once they always have to side against me for some reason.


A while back I had to go to a coffee shop to do some community hours. Apparently, when I was leaving my sister called me but didn’t notice. On the car ride home it’s somehow my fault that she dint call me again and I didn’t notice. My dad blamed it on my headphones (which I wasn’t wearing but it’s his only argument to side against me) but I think tha my sister should have at least called me again. I ended up going the wrong way even thought I was never given the exactly location and went to a different shop of the same brand.


SO NOW I have to walk 40 more minutes to get to the right place. On the way there my dad calls me to basically yell at me over the phone about how dumb I am for going the wrong way even though I had no directions. When I DO get there my sister and her friend is there. We were there for about 2 1/2 hours and I shit you not, she is ragebaiting me and calling me useless the ENTIRE TIME. Meanwhile, I’m just trying to do my work, and she was just bitching in my ear the whole time. Nevertheless, I did my work, (while masking my annoyance towards her) and we wait outside for my dad. As I get in the car the first thing he says is “why did you go the wrong way” AS IF WE DIDN’T ALREADY TALK ABOUT THAT 3 HOURS AGO. So I’m just going through the motions and shit and he’s clearly mad at me and to make it worse I my sister called me disrespectful (when we were there I didn’t say anything back bc I actually have a sense of respect) even though she not only started it, because she KNOWS he’ll side with her at this point. (I’ve called it out several times but they just ignore me)


She also gets away with things I can’t, such as telling to kms or die over the smallest shit (the other day I showed her a Pokémon pack, then THROWS IT ACROSS THE ROOM just because I wanted to open since I bought it with my own money and then told me to kms) Idk what it is but something about her saying something like that to me genuinely hurts me in a way nothing else can make me feel. Now sometimes she gets really angry and beats me relentlessly if she’s slightly angry. Scratching punching, kicking, she’s even tried to BITE ME before. It’s gotten to the point where I flinch when people move slightly or raise their arms, just because what she did to me. I would tell my mom in the morning that I got fucking assaulted by my sister last night (as you could see by the multiple bruises on my arms) and she would do/say LITERALLY NOTHING. Now I’ve never “fought back” because if I did the shit she did to me my parents would crucify me lmao. One time, a few years ago, she got really mad, and pulled out A LITERAL *stabby thing* swiped it at me, she missed, then just pointed at me for like 15 seconds (I was like 8 at the time and could barely speak)

How I’m at the point where I don’t want to do this because I can’t contribute, my entire family hates me, I hate my autism with everything I have and I’ve wanted to kill myself for it. (I haven’t actually tried but I did have to stop myself from jumping off a bridge last month)",1,1764126524.0,autism,1,1.0,False
1p6wtaf,https://i.redd.it/mckpvyohoi3g1.png,Very small update for MCWW UI,"I knew today that new Flux 2 supports prompts in json format. I had read before that other models support them too, but I didn't take it seriously then. But here it's on the official Black Forest Labs [website](https://docs.bfl.ai/guides/prompting_guide_flux2). It looks interesting, maybe worth checking it. I've added support of Gradio code editor for json prompts for convenient, it's needed to add \`json\` after the node title: \`<Json prompt:prompt:1> json\`",1,1764126482.0,StableDiffusion,0,1.0,False

1p6wp6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6wp6e/aitah_or_not_trying_to_fix_my_relationship_with/,AITAH or not trying to fix my relationship with my sister?,"Let's start from the beginning, my sister was diagnosed with high functioning autism. I will call her K, She is 7 years older than me, and when I was a kid I very much looked up to her. I would've considered her my best friend. As I got older though I started noticing differences, she was quite controlling and we walked on egg shells around her. As I became a teenager, I remember that BOTH of us were nasty to each other. She became the first person that I hated, and I made comments all the time. K also, touched my butt and picked my belly button when i asked her not to, her reason was that my husband would do it to me. It made me vedy upset and uncomfortable and there were lots of unwanted touches. As time went on, things came to a head and when my mom and dad left us alone together in the house.

I remember sitting in the living room and eating the dinner i made for myself. She started berrating me from the dining room, I proceeded to ignore her as I wasn't interested in fighting. She was very interested in fighting, so she came up flipped my food onto me and started yelling in my face. Of course she is a lot larger than me even now, but then the difference was extremely obvious (she was 22 and I was 15). 

My first thought was getting to a phone to call my parents (probably should've dialed 911). She towered over me screaming in my face, telling me i must be bullied at school otherwise why would i act the way i do. Then when I saw an opening I ran for the landline dialing a few numbers before she grabbed it from my hand and slammed it down. Next it was trying to find a place to lock myself in, I made it to the dining room and then was able to get up the stairs to my parents room. I was not fast enough to lock the door, or use their phone. For another few minutes I was stuck with her towering over me, and scared if I responded it would escalate. My next thought was the mainfloor bathroom, and I made my next run. I was not fast enough to lock the door, and she cornered me. My next plan to use my iPod to contact someone for help failed as she tried to break it and blame me for if it broke. 

It ended with her screaming at me, asking me why I treated her that way. Me scared out of my mind, couldn't answer and just said I don't know.  After that it was a blur, at some point I told my parents what happened when they came home. My father asked me if I wanted to press charges. All I could think was that I don't want to break up the family, it would be my fault so I said no. 

After this incident, I was terrified of her, and was stuck living with her for a month. Locking myself in my parents room whenever my parents would leave me alone with her. She made fun of me for it. 

As was the trend before this all happened she was still getting into fights with my dad and sometimes my mom. Her and my dad were explosive, and it never went well. Now though she blamed me for all the fights between her and everyone. She tried to trap me and my other sister, but we were able to get out of a window and contact someone to help us. After a month her and my dad had a huge blow out she broke a bunch of stuff and was finally kicked out.

This now meant that I was to blame for all the fights, issues, and her getting kicked out. My mom continuously asked me to have empathy for her. I became a recluse never leaving my room, and was thrown into a nice sprinkle of depression which my parents aptly ignored. Before she came to get her stuff back, my mom told me she was going out for a bit and that K would be there. I begged her not to leave, telling her it will happen again. She still left telling me she won't do it again. For some reason I believed her, but of course it did. At least this time, i was able to run outside (summertime). I was able to get help and someone came to get me. On the way to their house i saw my mom driving back and hoped in with her crying. 

As I grew, my mom pushed me for a relationship with her. I tried many times to have conversations with her to try and repair things. Every time we did, I would try to make it clear that both of us were in the wrong. All she heard was how terrible I was to her, and although the conversations would temporarily resolve things, somehow I would become the devil again. 

I got through high school, took a year off then went off to do mission work for a year. I came home for Christmas and instintively pulled away when K tried to touch me, but didn't even register it. Later she gave me the silent treatment, and was crazy pissed off. I tried to talk to her and ask her what was wrong and she said, ""if you don't know I'm not going to tell you."" At that moment, I decided never to do that to anyone. I was depressed, my dad got sick, and by the time I moved back home my sister K was back in the house just before me. This time with the worst cat in the world and a basement suite. I felt bombarded with change and forced to live with someone that couldn't even see me as a person. The first day I came back I found a dead mouse in my room and cried. I was hopeful that maybe things would be different, but I felt the resentment radiate from the basement. She was more controlling than ever, and blamed me even more for all the problems in her relationships. 

My only thought was to get out of there, so I decided I was going to move to another city where my sister D and J lived. When i moved, it was like breathing again, i was still depressed, but the threat on me was gone. I started dating someone, and my sister K had gotten engaged. My mom asked me to go to a psychologist with her, of course I said yes. It seemed that my mom wanted me invited to the wedding. The next time I came home to introduce my partner to my family, I also went to see HER psychologist. The psychologist, had us talk to him separately and all he told me was to give her whatever she wanted. Me, ever the peacekeeper and unsure how to do that anymore did what he asked. Accept, she asked me to tell my parents that I manipulated both of them, at 15 scared shitless. Bonus, she had to believe me. So I cried and told them what she asked me to, and IT WAS A LIE. My partner told me that I should have never done that, and I agree now. At the time though, I thought it meant this battle was over.

The next time she saw me, I went for a hug and she signaled that she didn't want one. Of course, that was fine, but apparently I was supposed to be mad that she didn't want a hug? Every time I heard her reason for as my family would say add me to THE LIST, it was through another family member not her. I would just get the silent treatment and then at the most inconvenient times a conversation about how I'm the worst and should apologize for everything wrong in her life. It sounds like an exaggeration, but barely.

We move ahead, she gets married and we go up for the weekend, no drama, she was very distracted. A little while later I come home for my bridal shower, which my mom knowing all the things that have happened with us decides to throw at K's house? Before the bridal shower, I'm helping set up, my fiance is hanging out with my dad and brothers. K asked to go for coffee, and me ever the optimist thinks maybe things are okay. 

NOPE.

She decided to be nice all the way until I was stuck with her at the coffee shop. Then she starts talking about how terrible a person I am, how I've ruined every relationship in our family with her. This time though, I say no to saying sorry. I decide thats enough and walk away, thinking about how I'm going to get home if she decides to leave me there. She didn't, but of course tells me how I don't care about her the whole way to her house. 

My partner and I get married, she came. I got pregnant saw them again, but things seemed okay. My now husband, made me feel safe and her soft spot for him helped in so many ways. We didn't go back home for a long time, had 2 kids. 

Came to visit and stayed with K which ended up being okay, my husband was with me the whole time. I really thought maybe things were okay.

3 years, we didn't talk, didn't see each other accept when she visited which was fine. Then we finally decided to make the trip back to my hometown for my grandma's birthday. My parents who had moved close to me and my sisters, would be staying with my parents would be staying with my sister K. There was no way we could fit, so we asked my aunty and she suggested staying at one of her friends houses that I knew. More than enough room, and an office so my husband could work. 

I texted K when I was coming down and that we would love to see her and her family. She asked if she could watch my kids for a sleepover, and I told her we were planning to try to stay together as a family as much as possible.  Which was mostly true because we had had such a busy time with emergency bathroom renos and my husband's huge project at work this was family time. The added thing was that sleepovers were a privilege and were only for a select few people. I offered to do a beach day or something else altogether, but she didn't respond.

When we went down to my home town, my dad came over and told me I was on THE LIST for not staying at her house. No communication on her front that was a deal breaker. A few days later she called and asked me out for coffee just me. Hell to the no, but I reiterated that we wanted as much family time as possible and then she hung up. I had decided that I no longer wanted to be alone with her. Then she sent me one last text, ""Please do not contact me again unless it is through a phycologist. I have nothing to say to you.""

My husband and I decided that there is no point in repairing something that was not healthy for anyone. I understand that autistic people can have a hard time with empathy, but from every conversation I've had with her over my life, it seems that she doesn't have any. She has no concept of who I am as a person and sees me as the devil manipulating everyone against her. Everyone in my family, especially my mom and my sister D have brought up everything she is struggling with and how she feels whenever I have brought up my feelings about her asking me to have empathy. I've tried, and my husband has seen me, and my mom has somewhat given up fixing it right now. Honestly, I'm at the point of just not caring about it, if she decides to give me the silent treatment at family stuff i don't care. I am tired of being accused of things I didn't do, and tired of trying to fix things. Although, I'm still unsure of what boundaries I should place or if I should leave it like I'm planning and just speak truth when needed.",0,1764126148.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False
1p6woy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanatical/comments/1p6woy3/are_you_searching_meaning_of_the_life/,are you searching meaning of the life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p6wnij,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1p6wnij/having_a_support_system_is_a_privilege_and_it/,Having a support system is a privilege and it sucks not having one.,"There is no place in this world for me, except for the one I built for myself and the silence is painfully deafening.  
I ended up isolating myself for almost 2 years because there's currently a wave of xenophobia in the country where I've lived for 12 years, and even though I'm half local because my biological father is from here, physically I look foreign and... you know how most of the world is when you're not white.

On top of being an inmigrant, I don't have a support system. My mother is a narcissist who has squeezed the life out of everyone who has ever come near her, and we had to send her back to our country of origin because she literally went psychotic and was psychologically torturing my younger brother, who has autism.  
I have seen my biological father five times in my entire life, and he lives in another country with his perfect legitimate daughters (as he keeps telling me).  
My younger brother has complex communication issues and is unable to talk to me as a human being, but rather as the solver of his problems, or a venting trashcan, because that has been my role all my life.

As an immigrant from a country with a large wave of migration, the two friends I made during my youth are now in different continents.  
I have been living for 12 years in a country where, although I had no trouble integrating because for some reason I'm a very functional worker, I have not been able to make friends at all. It's lonely. Painfully lonely.

Yes, I've been in therapy for 8 years.  
It's not all bad, just to clarify: I have a remote job. It was good until recently, but that's another topic. I'm happily married. I have a roof over my head, and finally i can buy all thebooks and mangas i deprived myself for years because of being ultrapoor and moving over 50 times trying to make my life better.  
And I know that at this part of my life I am not as bad as I were 10 years ago. I'm not complaining about what I have, but i have worked my ass off to have the life i have now, it's no privilege. 

It's just that I'm almost 40 and I feel like there's no place for me in the world, and the feeling that you can't fail, can't stop, and have to keep going on and on because no one's got your back for even 5 minutes, is painful as heck.  
I am aware that I have a loving husband, but it's not healthy to only have your partner to talk to, or to depend on, especially when you're trying to recover from CPTSD. And no, I don't want to meet people to vent about my problems, no. I don't want to cry on anyone's shoulder. If i need to vent, i wait every 2 weeks to speak with my therapist. I'm getting good at swallowing my pain.

I want people to share good moments with. And if they have bad moments i'd like to be there too. I like to be there and I would like to think someone could be there for me too. 

I go to the movies on my own, I travel alone, I go for walks alone, go for a coffee alone. I enjoy it. I don't hate being with myself.   
But my days are too silent. I want to watch a series, an anime or a movie and discuss it with someone. 

It's been hard.   
Not having anyone to tell them, “Hey, do you want to come over and watch anime or a movie? I'll cook your favorite dish!”  
Not having anyone to send you a birthday message.  
Not having anyone to invite over for Christmas dinner.   
That's all I want. To share special moments, the beautiful things in life. I would also love to be taken care of, just for an hour at least.  
I'm an ambivert, I need sporadic contact with other people even if it depletes my social battery and i need 7 business days to recover! 

For a year and a half, I've been going out once every two months to some social activity, but I can't seem to keep the contact beyond exchanging Instagrams. It's impossible to get a response to a message in stories beyond a “like.”  
I'd love to have a supportive mother.  
I'd like to feel what is to have a father.   
I'd like to hear the advise of a wise grandparent.  
I'd love to receive the unconditional love of a younger brother.  
I'd love to have a message that says ""hey, wanna go for a beer?""

I wrote a fiction book for the first time, and I'm thinking about publishing it. The editor asked ""who you'd invite to the book launch?"" I'm tremendously happy about my book  
My husband isn't even interesting in reading it. Not  his topic. Will not pressure him either.

It's lonely here.

I don't think i'm an amazing person  but i am definitely not an awful one either. I've been always there when someone needs me.  
That's it. I just wanted to vent because my throat is tight and my  chest feels heavy.

1p6wnhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/1p6wnhu/anyone_else_have_bad_experiences_on_online/,Anyone else have bad experiences on online political spaces?,"I’ll start:

I’m a former libertarian. I was raised by libertarian parents who are pro LGBT, pro gender equality, pro legal marijuana, and are pro business/free markets. In the morning to this day I see my dad reading economics articles in his reason magazine socks while drinking black coffee. They always wanted me to get an education and be self sufficient. 

However, when I was in a libertarian discord years ago, I can’t even describe how much authoritarian right wing rhetoric I saw.

There was also tons of misogynistic rhetoric as well. The majority of the server felt as if women should not work and should stay at home and care for children instead of “their useless HR jobs” because of how their “brain is wired socially instead of logically”

Many people also said “women and immigrants steal jobs from American men” which strikes me as even more bizarre considering I thought libertarianism was about giving more freedom to businesses so they can grow.

There were a few actual libertarians there and anarchists who just wanted to grill, but the loudest voices in the server became white supremacists in there who just wanted to smoke weed.

I remember using a particular antisemitic slur (That I had no clue was a slur) I learned there that (one regarding Jewish people and food) because I thought it meant Jewish people eat healthy, and my brother who is a left wing political scientist turned around and looked at me with his mouth agape wide open when I said it. 

It was just an unfortunate learning experience, and I got along with everyone pretty well there, but I eventually just left one day because it was so polarizing and divisive and culture war based. 

I also realized it seems like most of our issues come from corporate greed and not government taxes, as we currently have a fiscal conservative in office and the rich have gotten richer yet I still do not see prices going down.

1p6wnco,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1p6wnco/still_dont_know_how_to_process_thishelp/,Still don't know how to process this...help,"Let's start from the beginning, my sister was diagnosed with high functioning autism. I will call her K, She is 7 years older than me, and when I was a kid I very much looked up to her. I would've considered her my best friend. As I got older though I started noticing differences, she was quite controlling and we walked on egg shells around her. As I became a teenager, I remember that BOTH of us were nasty to each other. She became the first person that I hated, and I made comments all the time. K also, touched my butt and picked my belly button when i asked her not to, her reason was that my husband would do it to me. It made me vedy upset and uncomfortable and there were lots of unwanted touches. As time went on, things came to a head and when my mom and dad left us alone together in the house.

I remember sitting in the living room and eating the dinner i made for myself. She started berrating me from the dining room, I proceeded to ignore her as I wasn't interested in fighting. She was very interested in fighting, so she came up flipped my food onto me and started yelling in my face. Of course she is a lot larger than me even now, but then the difference was extremely obvious (she was 22 and I was 15). 

My first thought was getting to a phone to call my parents (probably should've dialed 911). She towered over me screaming in my face, telling me i must be bullied at school otherwise why would i act the way i do. Then when I saw an opening I ran for the landline dialing a few numbers before she grabbed it from my hand and slammed it down. Next it was trying to find a place to lock myself in, I made it to the dining room and then was able to get up the stairs to my parents room. I was not fast enough to lock the door, or use their phone. For another few minutes I was stuck with her towering over me, and scared if I responded it would escalate. My next thought was the mainfloor bathroom, and I made my next run. I was not fast enough to lock the door, and she cornered me. My next plan to use my iPod to contact someone for help failed as she tried to break it and blame me for if it broke. 

It ended with her screaming at me, asking me why I treated her that way. Me scared out of my mind, couldn't answer and just said I don't know.  After that it was a blur, at some point I told my parents what happened when they came home. My father asked me if I wanted to press charges. All I could think was that I don't want to break up the family, it would be my fault so I said no. 

After this incident, I was terrified of her, and was stuck living with her for a month. Locking myself in my parents room whenever my parents would leave me alone with her. She made fun of me for it. 

As was the trend before this all happened she was still getting into fights with my dad and sometimes my mom. Her and my dad were explosive, and it never went well. Now though she blamed me for all the fights between her and everyone. She tried to trap me and my other sister, but we were able to get out of a window and contact someone to help us. After a month her and my dad had a huge blow out she broke a bunch of stuff and was finally kicked out.

This now meant that I was to blame for all the fights, issues, and her getting kicked out. My mom continuously asked me to have empathy for her. I became a recluse never leaving my room, and was thrown into a nice sprinkle of depression which my parents aptly ignored. Before she came to get her stuff back, my mom told me she was going out for a bit and that K would be there. I begged her not to leave, telling her it will happen again. She still left telling me she won't do it again. For some reason I believed her, but of course it did. At least this time, i was able to run outside (summertime). I was able to get help and someone came to get me. On the way to their house i saw my mom driving back and hoped in with her crying. 

As I grew, my mom pushed me for a relationship with her. I tried many times to have conversations with her to try and repair things. Every time we did, I would try to make it clear that both of us were in the wrong. All she heard was how terrible I was to her, and although the conversations would temporarily resolve things, somehow I would become the devil again. 

I got through high school, took a year off then went off to do mission work for a year. I came home for Christmas and instintively pulled away when K tried to touch me, but didn't even register it. Later she gave me the silent treatment, and was crazy pissed off. I tried to talk to her and ask her what was wrong and she said, ""if you don't know I'm not going to tell you."" At that moment, I decided never to do that to anyone. I was depressed, my dad got sick, and by the time I moved back home my sister K was back in the house just before me. This time with the worst cat in the world and a basement suite. I felt bombarded with change and forced to live with someone that couldn't even see me as a person. The first day I came back I found a dead mouse in my room and cried. I was hopeful that maybe things would be different, but I felt the resentment radiate from the basement. She was more controlling than ever, and blamed me even more for all the problems in her relationships. 

My only thought was to get out of there, so I decided I was going to move to another city where my sister D and J lived. When i moved, it was like breathing again, i was still depressed, but the threat on me was gone. I started dating someone, and my sister K had gotten engaged. My mom asked me to go to a psychologist with her, of course I said yes. It seemed that my mom wanted me invited to the wedding. The next time I came home to introduce my partner to my family, I also went to see HER psychologist. The psychologist, had us talk to him separately and all he told me was to give her whatever she wanted. Me, ever the peacekeeper and unsure how to do that anymore did what he asked. Accept, she asked me to tell my parents that I manipulated both of them, at 15 scared shitless. Bonus, she had to believe me. So I cried and told them what she asked me to, and IT WAS A LIE. My partner told me that I should have never done that, and I agree now. At the time though, I thought it meant this battle was over.

The next time she saw me, I went for a hug and she signaled that she didn't want one. Of course, that was fine, but apparently I was supposed to be mad that she didn't want a hug? Every time I heard her reason for as my family would say add me to THE LIST, it was through another family member not her. I would just get the silent treatment and then at the most inconvenient times a conversation about how I'm the worst and should apologize for everything wrong in her life. It sounds like an exaggeration, but barely.

We move ahead, she gets married and we go up for the weekend, no drama, she was very distracted. A little while later I come home for my bridal shower, which my mom knowing all the things that have happened with us decides to throw at K's house? Before the bridal shower, I'm helping set up, my fiance is hanging out with my dad and brothers. K asked to go for coffee, and me ever the optimist thinks maybe things are okay. 

NOPE.

She decided to be nice all the way until I was stuck with her at the coffee shop. Then she starts talking about how terrible a person I am, how I've ruined every relationship in our family with her. This time though, I say no to saying sorry. I decide thats enough and walk away, thinking about how I'm going to get home if she decides to leave me there. She didn't, but of course tells me how I don't care about her the whole way to her house. 

My partner and I get married, she came. I got pregnant saw them again, but things seemed okay. My now husband, made me feel safe and her soft spot for him helped in so many ways. We didn't go back home for a long time, had 2 kids. 

Came to visit and stayed with K which ended up being okay, my husband was with me the whole time. I really thought maybe things were okay.

3 years, we didn't talk, didn't see each other accept when she visited which was fine. Then we finally decided to make the trip back to my hometown for my grandma's birthday. My parents who had moved close to me and my sisters, would be staying with my parents would be staying with my sister K. There was no way we could fit, so we asked my aunty and she suggested staying at one of her friends houses that I knew. More than enough room, and an office so my husband could work. 

I texted K when I was coming down and that we would love to see her and her family. She asked if she could watch my kids for a sleepover, and I told her we were planning to try to stay together as a family as much as possible.  Which was mostly true because we had had such a busy time with emergency bathroom renos and my husband's huge project at work this was family time. The added thing was that sleepovers were a privilege and were only for a select few people. I offered to do a beach day or something else altogether, but she didn't respond.

When we went down to my home town, my dad came over and told me I was on THE LIST for not staying at her house. No communication on her front that was a deal breaker. A few days later she called and asked me out for coffee just me. Hell to the no, but I reiterated that we wanted as much family time as possible and then she hung up. I had decided that I no longer wanted to be alone with her. Then she sent me one last text, ""Please do not contact me again unless it is through a phycologist. I have nothing to say to you.""

My husband and I decided that there is no point in repairing something that was not healthy for anyone. I understand that autistic people can have a hard time with empathy, but from every conversation I've had with her over my life, it seems that she doesn't have any. She has no concept of who I am as a person and sees me as the devil manipulating everyone against her. Everyone in my family, especially my mom and my sister D have brought up everything she is struggling with and how she feels whenever I have brought up my feelings about her asking me to have empathy. I've tried, and my husband has seen me, and my mom has somewhat given up fixing it right now. Honestly, I'm at the point of just not caring about it, if she decides to give me the silent treatment at family stuff i don't care. I am tired of being accused of things I didn't do, and tired of trying to fix things. Although, I'm still unsure of what boundaries I should place or if I should leave it like I'm planning and just speak truth when needed.",1,1764126004.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Pulled the cover and the timing chain looked like it aged ten years overnight.

Hooked up my ad600s to see what the numbers were doing.Cold start trims were hovering around +12 to +15 percent and smoothed out after a minute, which matched the brief rough idle. But once the engine warmed up, the timing advance on bank 1 started jumping between 2° and 9° at idle, and the cam/crank correlation kept drifting by a few degrees every time the RPM dipped.

That was enough to tear it down. Sure enough: the guides were chewed up, the tensioner was almost bottomed out, and the chain had so much slack you could probably tune it to a low E.

With a set of SATA tools, a Bosch tensioner, a fresh chain kit, and more coffee than I’d like to admit, it turned into a full timing job.

It seems as though I’m losing my body. My face. My spirt, and my soul. And yet, not a single person knows.

Or at least they pretend not to.

You see, a few months ago, I was kidnapped.

Masked men came into my family home while I slept. They awoke me and I tried to scream, but it was too late. They had already clasped a strong hand over my mouth and were prepping a rag soaked in what I assumed was chloroform.

The tallest of the men held me down while his companions pressed the rag firmly against my face.

My vision started to swim and, no matter how hard I tried, I could not remain conscious.

I woke up periodically. I remember being in the back of what appeared to be a moving-truck, like a u-haul or something.

I remember the cold metal floor of the vehicle as I struggled and failed to find my bearings; the way the turns slid me around and knocked me against the walls.

The next thing I remembered was being dragged from the truck by the same masked men who took me. They pulled me across the floor like a butchered cow carcass, waiting to be cut into slabs of steak.

They actually just let me fall, straight to the ground, upon nearing the giant exit.

The fall caused me to smack my head against the concrete, knocking me fully unconscious yet again.

When I awoke a third time, I was tied to a chair. The room was dark, aside from the light of a projector that cascaded bright fluorescent light against the concrete wall.

I was stripped down to my underwear, which appeared to be stained with urine and sweat.

The room was absolutely freezing, and I felt my body shiver as goosebumps arose one by one across my body.

My head pounded from my fall and from the effects of the drugs I had been on. It took me a few moments to regain my full vision, and when I did, I noticed something that turned the blood in my veins to ice.

It was an operating table. Beside it, a cart lined with all manner of surgical tools.

This awoke something within me.

I began to struggle violently against my restraints, shaking and thrashing like a man possessed.

In the process I ended up falling over again, still tied to the chair. I heard a sickening SNAP as my bound wrist smashed against the concrete floor.

As I cried out in pain, the projector screen suddenly shifted, and began playing a video.

It was a video of my family home, in flames. The fire roared and reached out to touch the  heavens.

Firefighters worked diligently to ease the blaze, but it seemed as though the harder they fought, the more the fire blazed.

Black smoke billowed from my childhood home, and my eyes began to welt up with tears I’d never thought possible.

Then, just as quickly as it came, the video abruptly stopped, and the room went completely black.

And I sat there, alone and nearly completely naked in utter frozen darkness.

I was forced to be listen to my own thoughts for what felt like an eternity. I broke my own heart several times over, and by the end of everything, I had been defeated entirely.

I lay there, face soaked with tears, shivering on the cold floor, when the projection screen suddenly turned back on.

This time, it was showing footage of the local news.

“DEVASTATING HOUSE-FIRE LEAVES GAINESVILLE HOME DESTROYED- NO BODIES RECOVERED.”

I stared at the screen, and a small wave of relief washed over me. That feeling quickly dissipated, however, when  I realized: my parents had definitely been home at the time of my kidnapping.

My relief turned to confusion, then to dread.

As if responding to my thoughts, a single fluorescent light flicked on, stretching down and revealing a tarp under its illumination.

I felt bile rise in my stomach as the anxiety of what could lie beneath the tarp taunted me; forced a million different scenarios through my head.

My heart pounded in my ears, deafeningly, and the sheer magnitude of my sensory overload was making me dizzy, and nauseous.

I felt the puke pull its way from my stomach and up my throat, spilling out onto my bare chest and puddling onto the floor.

In response to this, every light flicked on in an instant. It was so blinding that it made it nearly impossible for me to see the armed guards that came filing into the room.

Their rifles were trained on me, and each officer had their shield raised, as though I was the one to be scared of.

The team of guards then parted, never taking their eyes off of me, to make room for the men in white coats and surgical masks.

Whilst two guards restrained me, the three men in white coats prepped their surgical tools.

The guards cut the ropes from my hands, and my arms fell limply to my side, aching and shot with pins and needles.

As if I were threatening in any sort of way, one of the guards yanked my wrists behind my back, shooting a white hot pain up through my entire right arm.

I screamed in agony and was answered with a punch to the face.

The guards slammed me down on the operating table before tightening the restraints around my wrists, one of which I was CONFIDENT was shattered.

Once they had tightened the straps around each of my limbs, one by one they began filing out of the room, just as they had came.

The room was now deafeningly silent.

I cringed at the sight of the doctors who seemed to be wrapping up their preparations.

One of them looked over his shoulders to glance at me.

His face was displayed a look of indifference.

A lack of any sort of conscience.

He had a job to do, and I was his business.

Finally, he turned to me.

As he approached, his two colleagues walked solemnly towards the tarp a few meters away.

They were the ones that had my attention.

I watched them all the way up until one of them grabbed the tarp by its edges and yanked on it, revealing what I feared the most.

My parents lay there, blue and stiff.

They were both completely nude, and each had a sliced wound that stretched across their neck from one ear to the next.

They were nearly decapitated.

I began to thrash against the restraints, screaming at the top of my lungs for somebody, please, anybody, please just help me.

The doctors just allowed me to scream.

They allowed me to cry and waste my energy.

I went on for 5 straight minutes before the head doctor fastened a gag in my mouth and muffled what little screaming I had left in me.

As my eyes darted around the room, exhaustedly, they found their way back to my parents and the two doctors.

As they analyzed the bodies with a disgusting lack of care, one of them then proceeded to pick my mother’s head off the ground before twisting it around in his hands, checking for abnormalities.

They hadn’t NEARLY been decapitated. They were.

Standing from his kneeling position, the other doctor then walked over and picked my father’s head from the ground, mimicking the process of his colleague.

I couldn’t help it anymore and began puking through the gag, praying that I’d drown in my own vomit.

That wish was vanquished, however, when for the first time, the head doctor showed urgency.

He quickly removed the gag before forcing my head up.

My vomit spilled all over my body and in that moment, I begged God for death.

The head doctor gave me a glance that was almost…disappointed… disgusted at what I had done to myself.

Without taking his eyes off me, he reached down and retrieved a bucket of ice cold water, which he then proceeded to splash directly on top of me.

The shock made me tense up against the restraints, and I felt my wrist throb in pain.

My agony blurred my vision and made it seem as though the other two doctors had appeared beside the head doctor out of nowhere.

Each of them held a severed head belonging to one of each of my parents.

I couldn’t help but stare at them.

Their jaws hung open, and their tongues seemed bloated and inhuman.

The gore that dripped from their necks nailed utter grief straight through my soul.

And you know what the doctors did?

They tossed them onto one of the surgical carts like they were nothing. Like they were dirty tools, in need of sterilization.

I had no energy left to fight. No energy left to struggle. And the doctors sensed that.

There seemed to be an ever so subtle decrease in the tension amongst them, and it tore me apart.

As if to throw a bag of salt in my massive gaping wounds, they began chit chatting amongst each other.

Laughing and gawking in a language that was foreign to me.

One of them then proceeded to play opera music from his phone. Neither of his colleagues objected and instead, it seemed as though it increased their focus.

Without anesthesia, they began poking at me. Sticking me with needles and carving at the flesh on my face.

I felt blood trickle down my face, turning into a full faucet of the crimson liquid that poured out and leaked onto the operating table.

I let out one final scream, prompting one of the surgeons to jump and cut deep into my forehead.

It was evident that this frustrated him. Anger sounds the same in many languages.

He ordered his colleague to take a pair of clamps and pinch them firmly against my tongue.

The jagged teeth bit down hard and immediately filled my mouth with the taste of copper and iron.

The head doctor saw this, and I swear to God, the fucker smirked at me, satisfied at how helpless I looked.

He then regained his concentration, and began carving again.

He slides along the outline of my face, dragging his scalpel with nearly laser-like precision.

Once he connected the outline, he took his gloved hands, and started to pull ever so slightly on the flaps of skin he had opened up.

The pain became too much, and I’m not ashamed to say that I blacked out.

My mind had shattered, and I no longer had the strength to remain conscious.

When I awoke, I could feel the slight pressure of bandages that wrapped around the entirety of my head.

They covered my nose and mouth, but left two small slits that allowed me vision.

And through those slits, I was able to see something.

Something that no man should ever see.

Hanging on display, right in front of the operating table, was my own face. Hollow and lifeless. It looked identical to a mask you’d find in a Halloween store.

To make matters worse, I found that I couldn’t move. No matter how hard I tried, it felt as though I was completely paralyzed.

I also found that I wasn’t alone in the room.

“So you’re awake.”

The deep Slavic accent jolted me and my eyes immediately darted to the right.

“Hello, my sweet little experiment.”

The head doctor was sitting alone in a chair watching me, casually drinking from a coffee mug.

“You see, little experiment, I am friends with very rich people. Filthy rich. Rich enough to make you, your entire family, poof- disappear.”

His words bounced around in my head like a parasite, trying to claw its way straight through to my cerebellum.

His mask was pulled down now, revealing a gruff looking face. He has a shadowy beard, and his eyes were like that of a great white shark.

“My friends, they want to play little game. They make you disappear, whole family disappear. But YOU, little experiment, YOU go back.”

For the fist time in what felt like ages, I found the courage to speak.

“Go back? Go back after everything that’s happened? You guys are just gonna…let me go?”

I began to laugh uncontrollably, almost impulsively.

“Oh no, buddy. Hahahahaha you’re gonna have to kill me here. I don’t care HOW rich your friends are, you WILL pay for this.”

The doctor began to chuckle, then he himself began to laugh uncontrollably.

“Oh no, little experiment, we don’t kill you. We kill your parents. You, we need ALIVE.”

We then stared at each other, all whilst he enjoyed his cup of coffee.

“Well, if it’s okay with you,” he joked, “we must continue on with experiment.”

He stood up briskly and clapped his hands together.

As he walked over, casually, back to his surgical tool cart, I found that my mother and father had also been stripped of their faces.

“No one believe you. They think you are, how do you say? Koo-koo?”

After slipping on his gloves, I watched in horror as he picked up my father’s face. He waved it in front of me, tormenting me with the gore.

He then played around with my mother’s face. Twirling it around like a toy. He made her and my father kiss, all while laughing and singing like a mad man.

Using a pair of sheers, he cut little patches out of each of their faces, placing each piece on his tool cart.

He cut their faces down until they were nothing more than a pile of puzzle pieces, scattered across the cart.

“This is my favorite part,” he announced, cheerily.

For the next 6 hours, he stitched together a brand new face out of the chunks of what were once the smiling faces of my parents.

The creation was grotesque, and absolutely menacing.

“Don’t worry my little experiment. You three will soon be together forever.”

He carefully began to unravel my bandages, the early wrappings getting stuck to the open wound in the process and pulling at exposed nerves.

“I will make you….BEAUTIFUL, again, eh?”

Placing his new face on top of where mine should’ve been, he shifted it around until it fit perfectly amongst the seams on my face that he had created.

Again, without anesthesia, he began stitching my parents to me.

I felt the needle be inserted each and every time, and all I could do was sob silently.

Once he finished the initial stitching, he took an even smaller needle, and sewed the eyelids to the flaps of skin that remained atop my eyes.

“Has to be believable, yes?”

Blacking out from the pain once again, I drifted into a dreamless sleep.

When I awoke, I was still strapped to that damn table.

My face throbbed in agony, and the fluorescent lights seemed to burrow down deep into my eyes.

I found that the guards had returned, and the doctors were nowhere to be seen.

Without warning, 3 guards scooped me up from the table and cuffed me to a wheelchair, which they then proceeded to push towards the exit.

They brought me back to the same truck, but my torment was not over.

They drugged me yet again.

This time, however, it was lab grade methemphetamine.

They shot it straight into my veins, and locked me back inside the dark box truck.

I was completely losing it, and quite literally felt as though I was in Hell during the entire journey.

Every turn caused me to tumble, and the paranoia made me feel like my heart was going to explode.

The men decided to dump me on the side of the road, like trash, after removing their handcuffs.

They gave me one final punch to the gut before getting in their truck and driving away, never to be seen again.

I wandered through town, looking more monstrous than I believed imaginable for a civilian.

I got numerous pitiful glances, and many people seemed to divert their eyes any time I came within their vision.

As I wandered around, looking disfigured and homeless, I noticed something.

A missing persons poster.

One with my name and face on it.

There were dozens of them pasted across town, on nearly every small business and grocery store.

Yet, no one saw me.

No one noticed me right in front of them.

I told them, I said, “That is me, I am the person on that poster,” and hardly received any acknowledgement whatsoever.

A police officer stopped me, and the hope that maybe FINALLY I could get some recognition or genuine help was dashed immediately when he fined me for loitering and public indecency. He looked at me with such judgement and my heart froze over.

I tried showing him, I tried pulling my false face off but all he did was restrain me. All these fucking restraints.

He cuffed me and took me to the station, and STILL no one knew who I was.

They labeled me as insane, a crazed junky off the streets.

They went as far as to hold me in jail until my court date.

The judge herself found me insane, and sentenced me to spend time in the local insane asylum.

I keep trying, I keep attempting to pull this face off but it just will not budge. The stitching must have been flawless because, now,  I can’t even get past a slight peeling of the skin without giving up.

I just need you all to believe me, I need you all to hear me, I need you all to SEE me.

\- an Aeropress, v60, French press, and a few other doodads for making drip coffee

\- and here’s the tricky bit, a Gaggia Classic Pro that, despite my best efforts the last few years, I’ve never been able to dial in. every time 

\- and I’ve got a hand grinder, a Zpresso though I have to look up to remember which one

So every time I’ve tried to use the Vario-W, it’s seized up and I have to take it apart. My local cafe guy says, despite what I was sold in reviews, the torque just isn’t there in the Vario-W.

I have a good grinder now having fixed the dialing in on my Gevi Grindmaster so I can go for something nice which won't require a built in grinder. 

  
I recently returned the Meraki mainly due to the grinder being insufficient (Hence purchasing the Gevi GM) and also showing signs of some smaller issues which gave me a little bit of longevity anxiety. I wasn't sure it was wise to keep a machine from a relatively unknown manufacturer out of China even though it had some amazing aspects and the coffee with medium roast was some of the most delicious I've tried.  The rotary pump was great. The steam wand also good but not the biggest boiler for steam and ultimately the fear of how long this bit of tech would last was enough for me to return it.



I am now looking for a new machine ideally I would like dual boiler, potentially rotary pump. 



I've never used a ​E61 Heat exchanger having gone from Breville Barrista impress to Meraki and so any tips on whether to avoid or go for them would be great.

  
I like the idea of the Profitec 800 lever machine but the 45 min heat up timer is a definite no go lol.

Anyway I really would love some advice from owners of other machines. I want it to last a decade minimum really and will conduct regular maintenance and use spring water exclusively. 

  
Pls let me know what you guys think. 

  
Thanks.

There were some misunderstandings which created some distance but after clearing that up, for a few days, we became a bit closer and he asked me if I wanted coffee but I accidentally turned that down.

Been thinking a lot about what it *really* means to **unleash your best self**. It's not about some massive, overnight transformation. It’s about the small, daily optimizations that add up. The 1% better every day.

It's about making choices that move you toward being a little happier and a little smarter.

**For a Happier You:** ✨

This is all about managing your energy and emotional state. Small daily inputs can have a huge output.

*   **The 5-Minute Reset:** Before diving into work or after a stressful meeting, just step away. Look out a window, stretch, or listen to one song. Don't scroll, just *be*. It's a circuit breaker for your brain.
*   **Acknowledge One Good Thing:** It doesn't have to be a big gratitude journal entry. Just mentally acknowledge one thing that didn't suck today. Your coffee was good? The sun came out? Someone held a door? Acknowledge it. It shifts your focus.
*   **Emotional Planning:** Sometimes the ""happier"" part feels the hardest. It's one thing to say ""be positive,"" but it's another to feel it when you're in a funk. I've found that having a structured plan can make a huge difference in managing the emotional side of self-improvement. If you're looking for something more guided, I've been really impressed by **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** for creating a personal emotional support plan.

**For a Smarter You:** 🧠

This isn't about becoming a genius; it's about keeping your mind sharp and engaged.

*   **Learn Something Unrelated:** Spend 10 minutes learning about something totally outside your field. How do black holes work? What's the history of a random country? It builds new neural pathways.
*   **Explain It Simply:** Take a complex idea you're working with and try to explain it in your head as if you were talking to a 10-year-old. This forces you to understand it on a fundamental level.
*   **Ask ""Why?"" One More Time:** When you think you have an answer to something, ask ""why?"" one more time. Digging that extra layer deeper is where real insight comes from.

It's wild how these tiny daily shifts can compound over time. The person you are in six months is being built by the tiny things you're doing today. 🚀",1,1764125084.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1p6w7t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1p6w7t0/bizarre_and_vivid_dream/,Bizarre and vivid dream,"Last night, I had the most bizarre dream which is still vivid 8 hours later. For background, I live alone with my husband, no kids, in a single-storey house.

In the dream, I lived with my husband in a two-storey house with the ground floor largely devoted to games with bubblegum machines etc, either because my dream-husband had lots of grandkids, or we lived with a third person who had lots of grandkids; this part was unclear. 

In the dream, I woke up and went downstairs to make coffee and found lots of strangers in the house playing games. I walked outside and there were more strangers sitting at outdoor tables. I was furious, walked back inside the house and confronted a man, screaming, ""What the Hell are you doing in my house?!?"" He responded, ""I've had a hard life."" I stomped into my office to call the police, but my mobile had been replaced with a 1950's-style Bakelite rotary phone. 

By the time I'd finished the call, the police had arrived and were ushering the interlopers out. I was still angry because I thought the police were being too gentle and I wanted someone arrested. A police officer told me, ""I know this guy, I found him last week with an unlicensed prostitute"". As I left the room, I saw an ice-cream parlour in the corner which I hadn't noticed before, staffed by a young woman in a pink uniform. She gestured to the freezer cabinet and said, ""They've eaten half the ice-cream."" I looked again and saw that she was a young Katy Perry.

Then the house raised itself from its foundations and hurtled through the night sky, landing gently in a grassy meadow. I was standing by the open front door when an elderly man dressed a bit like Uncle Sam walked along the corridor towards me. I asked him where we were; he replied ""This is Norway."" I looked out over the meadow and saw a landscape with water falling over rocks. I realised I'd seen this before — then I realised that *this was actually stock footage.*

Then a second eccentrically-dressed man walked across the meadow towards me. The Uncle Sam character introduced him as the dance instructor for the British Royal Family. We shook hands, then the second man held out an Arthur Murray-style dance instruction sheet with numbered footprints towards me. I wondered if he was going to teach me how to dance.

What I don't understand is why the reaction to this is banning ALL AI generated content. Shouldn't people at least try to, you know, confirm if the content is useful / real first? Like a piece of code written with AI wasn't written by human hands, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. A recipe generated by AI may not have been made by a chef with years of training, but it can still be tasty.

I asked Gemini 3 yesterday- ""Yo, I really like milk tea. There's a coffee bar near my home that serves alcoholic coffee beverages, and they also have milk tea, but they don't serve an alcoholic version. I'd love to have an alcoholic milk tea to drink there when drinking with friends.""

Gemini 3 asked ""Does the coffee bar carry Kahlúa? Ask the bartender to make you a custom Kahlúa Milk Tea. It may cost you a bit extra, since it's off-menu, but it's worth trying if it fits your budget.""

Now, I could have taken this as AI Slop and ignored it, but I didn't. I went to the coffee bar, asked if they could make me a Kahlúa Milk Tea, paid a little extra for the amount of Kahlúa they added, and holy shit, it's my favorite drink now. Like a Kahlúa Milk, but sweeter and with the aroma of tea. This is what I'll be ordering every time I return to that cafe.

Why can't more people take the latter approach? Just... try it. If it sucks or doesn't work, it's AI slop and delete it. But it might just be something useful, even if it's not state-of-the-art.",20,1764124632.0,accelerate,8,0.95,False

He was beyond caring and compassionate towards me and definitely helped me out of a variety of situations over the years. He was the first person that made me feel like my life had value behind it because of the way he loved me, we had all of these wild adventures together and memories from drunk nights at the lake at 2 AM. It was like he was a piece of me I didn’t know I needed. When I moved across states, long distance became hard for both of us - both of us wanted to continue but the reality was we weren’t down the street from each other anymore. As we shifted apart I would still go back home to visit family and since he was apart of my friend group I would see him all the time and as a group we would still have mini adventures to the coast or late night coffee at Dennys. A lot of my life then felt like a Movie. Even after we broke up, he never dated another girl and one of our mutual friends told me he had told him it was because he hadn’t been able to get over me. Years passed and I got married, and it went up in flames. My husband had been treating me horribly and when everyone found out (same friend group) this guy I dated stepped in and helped me pack my things and helped me move no questions asked. Before he left the last day of helping me move I asked him why he was still willing to help me after all this time and he said because it’s important that he sees me happy.

Everytime I try dating now, I think of him. It could be the nicest guy but I still have all these memories of this guy I used to love. I don’t know if it’s because of the familiarity and when I get scared I naturally go back to thinking of someone who made me feel loved or something else. But I met this guy who is an absolute dream, he is everything I’ve wanted on paper to a T. But I’m scared because it’s all so new I haven’t really dated outside of this guy and my husband and I feel horrible because I have these little memories floating in the back of mind of this guy I used to love",2,1764124519.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

German Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Cream Pie or Cherry Pie?","All three of these were firsts for me as in I’ve never tried these recipes lol, they were a vision in my head and I winged it but they came together really well, or at least I think they did. Last time I made a German chocolate cake it was a pound cake and it was so effing (idk if I can swear) ugly that I knew I had to do it differently this time and I think it looks pretty dang cute for a German chocolate cake.

Anyways, here’s the recipes, hope y’all like them and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask:

German Chocolate Cake

German Chocolate Filling:

•1/2 cup salted butter

•1 cup evaporated milk

•1 cup brown sugar

•3 eggs

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•1 1/2 cups flaked coconut (sweetened)

•1 cup pecans, finely chopped

In a saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Continue mixing until the mixture thickens, careful not to let it curdle (if it does, it’s easily fixable, mine did and I fixed it, see note). Remove from the heat and pour in the pecans and coconut. 

Allow to cool completely and then refrigerate until solidified (4-6 hours).

Chocolate Bundt Cake:

•1 chocolate cake mix (ignore box ingredients)

•3oz dry chocolate pudding mix 

•4 eggs

•1/2 cup salted butter, melted 

•1 cup sour cream

•1/2 cup black coffee

Mix together the cake and pudding mix, then add in the remaining ingredients and mix until fully combined, careful not to over mix. Then pour into a greased and floured bundt pan and bake at 350° until a toothpick, when inserted  into the middle, comes out with slightly damp crumbs, not clean but not wet (30-40 minutes). Allow to cool for 15 minutes & remove from pan. Then allow to cool completely.

Ganache Drizzle:

•1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips

•1/4 cup heavy cream

Heat up the heavy cream, pour over the chocolate chips, allow the chocolate chips to melt/get soft and then combine until smooth. Set aside.

For assembly, put the filling into a piping bag and pipe lines going from the outer edge and into the middle. Then, smooth out the center using a spoon or spatula. Then, add a thin drizzle of the ganache on top, this is easiest to do with a piping bag/Ziploc bag. (This cake needs to remain refrigerated).

Then, eat up! Hope y’all enjoy! 

Chocolate Cream Pie

Pie Crust (makes 3, this recipe will use 1)

Mix together: 

•3 cups AP flour

•1 tsp baking powder

•2 tsp salt

Add to flour mixture and pinch/mix in, leaving small chunks of butter throughout:

•1 1/3 c salted butter, cold and cubed

Mix together & pour over the dry mix and combine until a dough forms: 

•1 egg

•1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 

•5 tbsp cold water

Form into a dough ball and divide into 3 crusts, leave one out to use and refrigerate or freeze the others.

Roll out to desired thickness and place into a 9-inch pie plate. Pike with a fork and crimp the edges. Place parchment paper down in the pie plate, pour in baking weights (dry rice or beans works too). 

Then, bake at 425° for 15 minutes, remove the baking weights and parchment paper and bake at 350° until the crust is baked all the way through and browned. Allow to cool completely.

Chocolate Cream Filling:

•1 cup heavy cream

•2 tbsp powdered sugar 

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•1/2 cup chocolate chips

•1/4 cup heavy cream

Whip together the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Set aside.

Heat up the heavy cream, pour over the chocolate chips, allow the chocolate chips to melt/get soft and then combine until smooth. 

Fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream until completely combined. You have to fold it in or else it will break and be gritty/curdled. And pour into the baked and cooked pie crust and set aside.

Whipped Cream & Toppings:

•1 cup heavy cream

•1/4 cup powdered sugar

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•Chocolate bar shavings, for topping

Whip together the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Place on top of the filled pie and top with the chocolate shavings. Refrigerate for 4-6 hours or overnight and serve. Hope y’all enjoy!

Cherry Pie:

Pie Crust (makes 3, this recipe will use 2)

Mix together: 

•3 cups AP flour

•1 tsp baking powder

•2 tsp salt

Add to flour mixture and pinch/mix in, leaving small chunks of butter throughout:

•1 1/3 c salted butter, cold and cubed

Mix together & pour over the dry mix and combine until a dough forms: 

•1 egg

•1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 

•5 tbsp cold water

Form into a dough ball and divide into 3 crusts, leave two out to use and refrigerate or freeze the other.

Roll out one to your desired thickness and place into a 9-inch pie plate. Poke with a fork and set aside. The other pie crust will be used for the top crust/lattice.

Cherry Filling:

•2 lbs dark pitted frozen cherries, thawed

•1 cup sugar

•1 tbsp lemon juice

•2 tbsp salted butter

•1/4 cup tart Cherry juice

•cornstarch slurry (5 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp tart Cherry juice combined) 

•1 tsp cinnamon

In a medium sized saucepan over medium heat, add in the cherries, sugar, lemon juice, butter, and Cherry juice. Allow that to come to a simmer and let the cherries soften. Then, add in the cornstarch slurry and mix until thickened. Then, remove from heat and add in the cinnamon and mix until combined. Allow to cool.

Then, roll the second pie crust out and either leave whole or cut into strips for a latticed top crust. If doing a whole crust, you’ll place it on top and do little slits for the filling to vent and cook and not explode (we’re not trying to be SpongeBob here). 

Once the filling has cooled, add to the bottom crust, place whatever top crust you want. Brush with an egg wash (1 egg + 1 tbsp of water mixed) and some turbinado sugar. Bake for 15 minutes at 425° and then reduce the heat to 350° for 40-50 minutes. 

Hope y’all enjoy!

1p6vn68,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1p6vn68/chihuahua_aggression_im_not_sure_whats_wrong_or/,chihuahua aggression (?) im not sure whats wrong or how to help her,"my chihuahua is 10 months old. she is a pretty good dog. very loveable, but also very snappy. if i pet her and she randomly decides she doesnt like it anymore she will bite me (not hard, but i mean shes biting me lol it still hurts!!). she also just bites me for no reason. im assuming this is just normal teething. 

but the actual issue is that whenever i try to get a harness or sweater on her she FREAKS out. harness is the worst. she will get stiff, she will growl, she will snarl, and she will bite. HARD. she barely bites down when she teeths on me which lets me know she doesn't actually want to hurt me, but when the harness/sweater goes on she fully tries to hurt me. usually she doesnt even growl to warn me she just goes in straight for the bite.  

her trigger is definitely things going over her head. but even just trying to get a harness off of her she hates. if i try to touch the clamp to unclasp it and let her out of it she will still bite me. 

i can't even take her for walks, because every harness i try she wont let me put it on her. i usually only get it on halfway before its too much for me to handle and i have to give up. she used to go on walks with sweaters that had the little metal loop on the back. she was fine with that for a good while. but i dont have any more sweaters that fit her, and they arent that sturdy. i want to use an actual harness. i wanted to use a collar on her but i don't want to hurt her little neck. 

she also gets aggressive when its bed time. when its time for her to get into her kennel for bed, i have to chase her around. she will run laps around the coffee table when she notices that im trying to put her to bed. when shes done that, she will back up into a corner. when i try to pick her up she growls and bites me. 

im not sure whats wrong?? is there anything i can do to help her? i cant help but feel like shes afraid of me and thats not what i want. 

ive tried to train her to the best of my ability and shes went to puppy classes (successfully) but these are the only things i cant really fix with her.

I will start when i moved 3 hours away to go to college, i got a dorm and started school. This was fine for about a week, but my mental health started to deteriorate, i didn’t have any savings or a job up there while i was trying to work back home on weekends and keeping up with my car payment. I was having alot of car issues that i couldn’t afford, and i knew no one in a 3 hour radius to call if i needed anything. I had to leave my cats with my dad who did not want them and was trying to find other homes for them and this left me so heartbroken i had daily panic attacks over it. Trying to manage school work, driving home to work on weekends, the stress of my cats, not having a single friend and not being able to make any left me broken, i was having ideations of not being “here” anymore. 

So i decided for my health i would move back home and try to seek professional help and have the support of my family and switch to online classes for the semester. Once i got back it seemed i wasn’t wanted and i didn’t have any family support, along with trying to find a professional that would take my insurance was near impossible. 

This is why my boyfriend (C) suggested that maybe we get an apartment with his friend (B) and we can all split the rent. I thought this was a good idea and it would get me out of a place i didn’t feel wanted at anymore. 

For the first week it was great, i got to have my cats with me and a place to cook and call home. B even asked me about getting another cat from his brother which i agreed to under the assumption that it was going to be B’s cat. 

After the first week things went down hill, B has a best friend (A) who is basically living on our couch. The three boys do not respect the house or my things. They never ever clean up after themselves, they always expect me to cook dinner for all of us and then clean the kitchen and dishes after. They never pick up trash they create around the house or anything else. A is beyond disrespectful of my personal things, for example i brought home untouched left overs and not even two hours later after i had fallen asleep A ate the entire thing, leaving his dirty dishes and the empty to-go box on the counter and coffee table. A and B even decided to eat my specific candy that i had bought and was saving for myself and leave they left the empty wrapper where i left it after i had already talked to them about how upset and disrespected i felt the first time they ate my stuff. They proceeded to act like i was absolutely insane for being upset over “ a few pieces of candy”.

B does not do anything to contribute to the care of the cats except buying cheap scented clay cat litter and using it to replace my special crystal litter i use. I use the special litter because one of my cats is very sensitive to it on his skin and can only use the special kind. He knows this and continues to randomly replace my cat litter with the cheap one because he doesn’t like how it “clumps” EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER EVER SCOOPS THEIR LITTER. He did this again today. 

My boyfriend (C) doesn’t speak up for me at all, he lets them walk all over, disregarded, and disrespect me. I have talked to him about how stressed out i am trying to keep the house running and clean, working a full time job, souly taking care of 3 cats and doing online school full time. I have always been a honor roll student and now my grades are falling so far down and feel like there is nothing that i can do to balance everything. He still doesn’t make an effort to help clean or anything else. 

I have also expressed my desperate desire for more romance in our relationship due to my love language being acts of service, and he never makes an effort to do that either. 

B said the reason he doesn’t clean is because “ he works so many hours he barely even contributes to the mess” which is the stupidest thing i have ever heard because he does contribute to it. 

It has been 2 months of this and i genuinely can’t do it anymore, i wash the dishes that i create as i dirty them and the rest of the dishes sit in the sink for days and days, they do not care that they are living in filth. They do not see an issue with their behavior at all and do not wish to change. 

I have a plan that i have told no one about, a plan where i have been saving everything i possibly can and will continue to until January, i will get an apartment close to my college where i can have my cats, i will apply for jobs in December to hopefully have one by move in. I have no idea how i will inform C about me moving out and obviously that would mean the end of our relationship. I am so scared to hurt everyone but i am realizing i am hurting myself by allowing myself to be in this environment and situation and i need to start thinking about me. Please give me advice on what to do, do you think my plan is valid or stupid? please tell me if I am forgetting anything to help with my moving transition or anything else . I am so lost and i need an unbiased opinion.

I used to volunteer at a shelter and id always wanted to adopt a rescue dog. The cliche is so true that he rescued me. It's after he came into my life that so much changed - I met my now wife , and he and I fell in love with her at the same time. He was a ""mama's boy"" to her and  ""dog brother"" later to our daughter. As he grew older, he stayed handsome as ever and he grew stoic and wasn't as playful. 

He gave us everything until he couldn't anymore. He was diagnosed with cancer on the spleen, we did a whole bucket list, took a dog centered family vacation, spoiled him silly. Our favorite way to spend the weekend was at a dog friendly coffee shop as a family. He continued doing his part but he kept declining. And eventually we had to say goodbye because continuing forward would have resulted in pain for him , his body had given out. His face flashes in front of me many times a day.

I can't ruffle his ears, give him a neck massage, or cuddle with him on the couch again. I can't take him out on walks or family vacations again. I can't scold him for stealing a treat out of my daughter's hands again. I can't feed him his favorite peanut butter again.  

Until we meet again. Thank you for choosing me and taking a chance on me (and later us) at the shelter. ",3,1764122864.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

1p6vgzy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6vgzy,Reze Movie/Arc analysis Part 1,"
Warning: What I've written is quite a lot and contains spoilers.

I think most people would agree that this film, and this arc in general, is a masterpiece.

It starts right in the first few seconds of the film, where Denji has another dream about the door, which is meant to hint at an important plot point: Denji's killing of his father, something he'd kept buried deep inside due to his trauma. However, it's not particularly relevant to this arc.

In the intro, we see Denji, Aki, and Power going to work, but we also see rats highlighted, suggesting that Makima is always somehow present. Which is actually quite creepy.

Afterward, Makima offers Denji a date. When they start their movie marathon, Makima always rates the film afterward, saying, for example, that it's rather average, etc. This is probably meant as a critique of modern times, because there are many films that are simply soulless. Which wasn't the case before. Of course, there were bad movies back then too, but there were more good ones.

Denji had always wondered why, for example, he didn't laugh or feel sad during a particular movie while others did. And he'd been wondering for a while if he even had a heart, which is a big part of his character development.

For example, when Himeno died, he felt nothing and wondered if that was normal. And yes, it is normal, because Denji simply hadn't known Himeno for very long or had much to do with her; after all, she wanted to kill him too. That's human nature; you can't feel deeply sad if you had no connection to that person.

But back to the movies. Denji just couldn't connect with them. Because nothing like that had ever happened to him, and he couldn't understand it. But then, during the last movie, a simple, short scene that could have such a powerful effect made him cry, and Makima too. He didn't know why he suddenly started crying, but deep down he understood because the film scene depicts a profound connection between two people, which can be interpreted on different levels. For him, Pochita was also that connection, and at the same time, he too is searching for love.

Regarding the film scene again, this film actually exists, and it's a Russian film (which is a little teaser for a certain Russian character who appears shortly). The film is about a son and his mother. I don't know what else happens in the film. But the way this scene was portrayed was very important because there was no unnecessary music, no dialogue, nothing just the gestures of finally seeing each other and embracing. This scene becomes important again later, which is what happens at the end of the film.

It was somewhat similar with Makima because, as the control devil, she finds it difficult to have an equal relationship with someone who is on her eye sight. This moment gave us deeper insights into her character. As at the end of Part 1, Pochita said that Makima needed hugs. But she was raised by the PS, and as a result, her nature fully developed under control. She's envious of people who get that. But this isn't meant to be a Makima analysis.

After the movies, Denji asked Makima if he even had a heart, and she touched his chest and said yes. This scene becomes even more profound when you know what happens later. She simply wanted to feel/hear Pochita and didn't care about Denji at all. This gives the scene a completely different meaning.

If you've already read Chainsaw Man, you have to imagine some scenes as if you don't know what happens next. If you do that, you'll find a lot of foreshadowing, which is really crazy.

Then there's the moment when Denji and Reze first met in the phone booth. It was either a genuine coincidence, which is why Reze was laughing, or she was following him. But I think it was a coincidence. She was probably about to kill Denji at that moment, but he'd unleashed his Rizz abilities, and that's why she fell in love. I've often read that Reze fell in love later or something, but it happened right then and there. After two weeks of seeing each other at the coffee shop, Reze wondered why Denji wasn't in school, because in her eyes, it's completely messed up to have a 16-year old boy working as a demon hunter, which is true, and something she can relate to, but we learn more about that later. It's just a little hint that she's been thinking about it a lot.

When they finally got to school, they both really enjoyed that moment, enjoyed school a bit, and so on. But then came a very important scene for the movie, the beautiful pool scene. I've often read that many see this as fan service, which it isn't. This scene simply depicts the freedom of that moment, how they're free from thoughts outside the scene and simply enjoy it. They're just two teenagers in love having fun. And both of their guards were down, firstly, of course, because they were naked in the water, but mostly for Reze, who couldn't properly use her ability in the water. She wasn't Bomb Devil in that moment, she was Reze and the same goes for Denji.

Meanwhile, we also see a spider and a moth getting caught in its web. This can be interpreted in several ways because the people representing the spider and the moth are often changed. On the one hand, it could be that Reze is the moth because falling in love with Denji instead of taking his heart was her downfall from the beginning. On the other hand, Denji is also the moth because Reze is the Bomb Devil. Then again, both are the moth and the water is the spider, because at the end of the film, Denji wraps Reze up and jumps into the water with her. Or Makima is the spider and the moth is Reze and Denji, because their plan wouldn't have worked from the start, since Makima is there. You see, you can use this back and forth.

I'd stop with the analysis for now, because there's already a lot to take in. 💀 I'd be very interested in your opinions and interpretations. I'd be happy if you like this post

For the first week it was great, i got to have my cats with me and a place to cook and call home. B even asked me about getting another cat from his brother which i agreed to under the assumption that it was going to be B’s cat. 

After the first week things went down hill, B has a best friend (A) who is basically living on our couch. The three boys do not respect the house or my things. They never ever clean up after themselves, they always expect me to cook dinner for all of us and then clean the kitchen and dishes after. They never pick up trash they create around the house or anything else. A is beyond disrespectful of my personal things, for example i brought home untouched left overs and not even two hours later after i had fallen asleep A ate the entire thing, leaving his dirty dishes and the empty to-go box on the counter and coffee table. A and B even decided to eat my specific candy that i had bought and was saving for myself and leave they left the empty wrapper where i left it after i had already talked to them about how upset and disrespected i felt the first time they ate my stuff. They proceeded to act like i was absolutely insane for being upset over “ a few pieces of candy”.

B does not do anything to contribute to the care of the cats except buying cheap scented clay cat litter and using it to replace my special crystal litter i use. I use the special litter because one of my cats is very sensitive to it on his skin and can only use the special kind. He knows this and continues to randomly replace my cat litter with the cheap one because he doesn’t like how it “clumps” EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER EVER SCOOPS THEIR LITTER. He did this again today. 

My boyfriend (C) doesn’t speak up for me at all, he lets them walk all over, disregarded, and disrespect me. I have talked to him about how stressed out i am trying to keep the house running and clean, working a full time job, souly taking care of 3 cats and doing online school full time. I have always been a honor roll student and now my grades are falling so far down and feel like there is nothing that i can do to balance everything. He still doesn’t make an effort to help clean or anything else. 

I have also expressed my desperate desire for more romance in our relationship due to my love language being acts of service, and he never makes an effort to do that either. 

B said the reason he doesn’t clean is because “ he works so many hours he barely even contributes to the mess” which is the stupidest thing i have ever heard because he does contribute to it. 

It has been 2 months of this and i genuinely can’t do it anymore, i wash the dishes that i create as i dirty them and the rest of the dishes sit in the sink for days and days, they do not care that they are living in filth. They do not see an issue with their behavior at all and do not wish to change. 

I have a plan that i have told no one about, a plan where i have been saving everything i possibly can and will continue to until January, i will get an apartment close to my college where i can have my cats, i will apply for jobs in December to hopefully have one by move in. I have no idea how i will inform C about me moving out and obviously that would mean the end of our relationship. I am so scared to hurt everyone but i am realizing i am hurting myself by allowing myself to be in this environment and situation and i need to start thinking about me. Please give me advice on what to do, do you think my plan is valid or stupid? please tell me if I am forgetting anything to help with my moving transition or anything else .

I pack healthy meals but by 3am I'm absolutely starving and end up hitting the vending machines or eating way more than I planned.

The problem is my body has no idea when it's supposed to be hungry anymore. Sometimes i'm starving at 2am, sometimes I can't eat at all during my shift then I'm ravenous when I get home and should be sleeping. My eating schedule is completely destroyed and it's showing on the scale.

I tried drinking coffee to kill the hunger but then i can't sleep when i get home, which makes everything worse. Energy drinks same problem plus they make me feel like garbage. I was honestly starting to think weight gain was just inevitable on night shift. I started looking for different kindsof appetite suppressants but almost all of them rely on caffeine as one of the main ingredients, so that doesn’t work. I started looking into fiber supplements instead and started using ozzi about 5 weeks ago. I take it around 2am which is when the vending machine cravings usually hit me hard. It's not perfect but I'm finally not demolishing a whole bag of chips and candy bar every single shift. Honestly I’m not sure what in it is working so well and I don’t really know how I should find out because they have a proprietary blend with their formula, there’s no way to know all the dosages I think. But I mean something in there works so thats good enough for me.

Down 7 pounds in the last month which is the first time the scale has moved in the right direction since i started nights. I still have 8 more to go to get back to where i was but at least it feels manageable now instead of fighting a losing battle every night.

Benny's Apt

**Location:** Denver, CO  
**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Setting:** Benny’s downtown apartment/home office



Benny Bronson, just turned forty, woke to the thin blush of November sunlight filtering through the blinds of his high-rise apartment overlooking downtown Denver. The city was waking slowly, a muffled hum rising from the streets below. Benny stretched, padded to his kitchen, and brewed a cup of rich Colombian coffee his morning ritual, as essential as the horoscope he’d soon read.

His home office, tucked in a corner of the open-plan living space, was both sanctuary and command center. Framed by neat shelves of cookbooks and travel memoirs, his desk was scattered with dessert bar menus, invoices, and sticky notes. As manager of Baumé – A Dessert Bar inside Union Station, Benny’s world was a swirl of chocolate, caramel, and crème brûlée, all anchored by the steady drumbeat of hospitality work.

But before emails or spreadsheets, Benny opened his astrology app, thumb poised with anticipation. He was a Libra through and through diplomatic, charming, sometimes indecisive, but always seeking balance. Today’s horoscope read:



**November 24, 2025:**

  
*You never know unless you ask! Right now, curious Mercury is meeting money-wise Venus inside your 2nd House of Worth, making it easier to discuss pay (whether you're the payee or payer) in a respectful way. You could ask for a discount on a less-than-satisfactory service or be offered a tip -- even if your industry doesn't typically involve tipping. A holiday bonus could also be in store! When you know your worth, you'll be able to advocate for yourself with confidence.*



Benny smiled, letting the words roll around in his head. The past few weeks had been turbulent at Baumé. The holiday rush was looming, and staff turnover had left them short-handed. Benny had stepped up, covering shifts, keeping the mood upbeat, smoothing out the bumps. Yet, he couldn’t help but wonder if his efforts were truly recognized or if he was simply expected to pick up the slack.

He reread the last lines: *When you know your worth, you'll be able to advocate for yourself with confidence.* Benny’s mind drifted to the conversation he’d been avoiding. His boss, Ramona, had praised his dedication more than once, but praise didn’t pay the bills. Maybe it was time to ask about a holiday bonus, or at least a raise.

His phone buzzed. A message from Ramona:  
*“Can you come in early? Need to talk payroll and holiday tips. Coffee’s on me.”*

Benny grinned at the cosmic timing. He dressed blue button-up, his lucky socks, a splash of cologne and glanced at the tidy chaos of his home office. He paused, considering the advice from his horoscope. Should he hold on to the security of his current role or move on, chasing something new?

The truth was, Denver’s culinary scene was competitive and Baumé was one of the jewels of Union Station. Benny loved the creative energy, the satisfied smiles of customers at the dessert bar, the camaraderie of his team. But he’d also received feelers from a new pastry startup in RiNo, one offering more creative freedom, perhaps even a partnership. It was tempting, but risky.

As he stepped out into the crisp Denver air, Benny weighed his options. The city shimmered in the morning light, promise glinting off the glass towers. He remembered the wisdom of his Libra sign: balance, harmony, fairness.

Today, at least, he’d ask for what he was worth. Whether at Baumé or beyond, Benny resolved to advocate for himself with the same grace and confidence he brought to every caramelized creation. Sometimes, holding on meant standing up for yourself. Sometimes, moving on meant betting on your own potential.

Some of our baristas are going on strike tomorrow but I’m not because this job was the thing to get me stable. I was suicidal and in the psych ward before getting this job and it has literally saved my life and given me more purpose and happiness than I’ve ever felt. Plus my boss is the most supportive kind human I’ve ever met and created the perfect environment for us. Their corporate bosses are the problem. 

It was an incredible hard decision but I’m going to keep working through the strike to try and maintain my sanity and stability. I looked at the strike information and it instructs picketers who will be outside my store to call me a scab and try to convince me not to work. 

My ex was insanely verbally abusive (as well as physically and sexually) and I feel like if anyone yells at me or calls me names I might genuinely lose it. No one has harassed me like since I left my abuser and I don’t feel nearly strong enough to take it. I don’t know how I’m going to stay stable and grounded. Any advice would be incredible. 

Edit for Clarity: I’m a communist politically and always support striking workers fighting against exploitation. But in this one scenario, I physically can’t make myself put my mental stability and financial life at risk. ",3,1764121953.0,ptsd,2,1.0,False

It went pretty well, we talked for a good bit and had some shared interests and experiences and I felt like we kind of clicked.  Before we left I asked if she wanted my number and she did so we exchanged numbers and she even double checked it was the right number before we left.

After we both expressed we had a good time and would like to do it again so we scheduled a lunch date for the next weekend chatting a bit throughout the week.  The day before she apologized and asked to reschedule since she had gotten sick, which I didn't think anything of since my sister had just gotten sick the day before so I even thought I may have indirectly gotten her sick.  We chatted some more and agreed to have our date the next weekend.  We scheduled a time and place and she even said she was excited the night before.  The day of came and she double checked the place and time.

about 15 mins before the time I sent a text saying I was on my way, and she replied that she had just left.  I got there about 5 minutes before and texted that I was there.  I went in and was waiting inside for like 25 mins before I texted and asked if she was nearby, no response.  I waited another 10 minutes and then tried calling and it went straight to voicemail.  I waited another 20 minutes before trying calling again but the same result.  I left and sent a text saying I was heading out and asked if something had happened and I hoped she was okay.  It's been 5 days and haven't heard anything, all my messages are still on delivered so I assume she blocked me?  I don't know.  If she didn't want to go out there were a 100 ways she could've dipped out before literally saying she was on her way.

Goal & Threat Model

**Primary Goal:** Set up and use Pixel 10 with GrapheneOS as anonymously as possible

**Threat Model:** Avoid big tech surveillance, spyware, and tracking

# Background

* Relatively new to privacy (started summer 2019, became serious about 2 months ago)
* Transitioning from full Apple ecosystem
* Technical skills available but new to some privacy-specific processes

# Current Phone Status

**Purchase:** Bought Pixel 10 from retailer in cash, no personal information shared, in-person transaction

**Setup:**

* Skipped through initial setup without providing any information
* Never inserted SIM card
* Never turned on WiFi or Bluetooth
* Phone remains in pristine, unconnected state



# Pre-Installation: VPN & Update Questions

# The Challenge

GrapheneOS installation requires the phone to be updated first, which needs internet access.

# VPN Options (Need Help Deciding)

**Option 1: Router-Level VPN**

* Add VPN to network/router
* **Need resources/instructions for this** \- have technical skills but never done this before

**Option 2: APK Transfer to Phone**

* Transfer VPN client APK from laptop via cable
* **Problem:** Likely won't work since VPN can't be turned on until after login, which requires internet

# VPN Payment Plan

1. Trade Monero with Bitcoin on Bisq (never used Bisq or bought Monero before - **open to alternative suggestions**)
2. Use Monero to pay for Mullvad VPN
3. Enable kill switch/lockdown mode on Mullvad to prevent IP leaks even after restart

# Location Question

**Considering:** Performing the update at a coffee shop (Starbucks for reliable WiFi) for added safety

**Alternative consideration:** Should I use Orbot instead of Mullvad?

# Key Assumption to Verify

Can I download the phone update while on VPN? (Haven't used Android as primary phone in 12 years)



# Installation Plan

1. Update phone (via VPN)
2. Unlock bootloader from settings
3. Follow GrapheneOS website instructions
4. **Request:** Let me know any steps where I should be particularly careful



# Post-Installation Configuration

# Immediate Security Steps

* Disable OEM Unlocking in developer options

# Network Settings

* **No SIM card ever** \- not needed for my use case
* Communication via Signal/Molly and VOIP number only
* Still researching VOIP apps - **recommendations welcome**

# App Store Priority Order

Based on GrapheneDeveloper & SideOfBurritos YouTube recommendations:

1. Graphene store
2. Accrescent
3. Obtainium
4. Google Play Store (anonymous)
5. Aurora (anonymous)
6. F-Droid

**Question:** Does this order need changing?

# System Settings

* Install Futo Keyboard or OpenBoard; revoke network permissions
* Enable auto-reboot
* Disable NFC
* Enable storage scopes under individual app settings as often as needed

# Browser Decision

**Undecided between:** Vanadium / Firefox Focus / Firefox

# Core Apps Planned

* **Communication:** Signal/Molly, VOIP app
* **Maps:** OSMAnd
* **Photos:** Immich (eventually)
* **Self-hosted apps:** NextCloud apps
* **Banking:** Desktop or phone browser only
* **Minimal usage:** Planning to use only the 12 pre-installed apps plus necessary open-source E2E apps



# User Profile Strategy

# Concept

Create separate user profiles per corporation to isolate apps:

* Example: All Google/Alphabet apps → 1 user account
* Example: All Meta apps → 1 user account
* Example: Reddit → 1 user account

(These are hypothetical examples - don't plan to use most of these)

# Profile Management

* Comfortable with up to 6 user accounts maximum
* Could manage more if switching isn't too difficult
* **Deciding:** Use Owner profile for daily use, or create new profile for VOIP + Signal as ""Daily"" profile? Currently leaning toward the latter.



# Daily Usage Plan

# Communication

Successfully moved all friends and family to Signal

# Data Storage Philosophy

* **Goal:** Self-host everything (starting December/January project)
* Don't want to store anything locally on Pixel
* Self-host: Contacts, Calendar, Files, Photos
* Maintain single source of truth between computer and phone

# Google Play Services

Trying extremely hard to avoid installing Play Services completely. Will use websites over apps whenever possible. Computer is primary device for almost everything.

# Connectivity Strategy

**Primary method:**

* Keep phone offline or connect via portable hotspot device with VPN when going out
* Understanding: Safe to connect to public WiFi as long as VPN is active

**Transition period (first 2 months):**

* Old SIM card with old phone number stays in dumbphone
* Dumbphone kept on for occasional 2FA and transitioning calls/texts to new VOIP number
* After 2 months, dumbphone stays off and remains at home

# Account Creation Workaround

**Problem encountered:** Creating new Gmail account now requires phone (scan QR, send SMS to +44 number)

**Solution:** If needed to create account on phone, will use temporary phone numbers from [smspool.com](http://smspool.com) website, paid with Monero (suggested by SideOfBurritos YouTube)



# Additional Concerns & Forum Feedback

# From GrapheneOS Forum Discussions:

**Concern 1: IMEI Registration** Someone mentioned that as soon as you turn on a new phone, the IMEI and location get registered with the closest tower even without a SIM.

* **Question:** Is this true?

**Concern 2: Setup Location** Forum suggests doing setup at home instead of library/coffee shop, and connecting directly to ISP is fine.

* **My position:** Somewhat disagree and conflicted
* VPN would provide same protection as using WiFi outside home for these purposes

**Concern 3: Airplane Mode & Bluetooth**

* Somewhere read/watched that you could disable airplane mode and Bluetooth on GrapheneOS
* Someone said this isn't possible and suggested against it
* **Question:** What are your thoughts on this?



# Request for Feedback

Happy to edit and add any missing details as needed. Looking for:

* Verification of my assumptions and plans
* Recommendations for alternatives where I'm uncertain
* Warnings about any steps where I should be particularly careful
* Resources for router-level VPN setup
* VOIP app recommendations
* Any other privacy/security considerations I may have missed",5,1764121736.0,GrapheneOS,10,0.86,False

Art’s just trying to enjoy his break in the newspaper lunchroom with Paula and Linda—two mutant zombie coworkers who sip coffee like it’s business as usual. But when GIANT BUGS start casually grabbing coffee, nobody seems to notice… until a tiny bug scurries across the floor and Art absolutely loses it. Screaming, jumping, flailing—pure panic in a room full of calm monsters.

This time, it’s about my job search/desired salary. I’ve been looking for a new job. I currently make $61k/year before taxes. Im comfortable, but I’m not thriving. I eat out once a week, I only buy necessities for groceries (I ration portions, too, to keep costs low), I get a fancy coffee shop coffee twice a month, and I occasionally splurge (probably $500-1,000 per year) on things like books, legos, clothes, etc. The rest of my money goes towards bills and paying down extra on debts (a small student loan and mortgage, nothing crazy, don’t even have a car payment). I haven’t gone on a vacation in 2 years. 

So I have a friend who makes $80k and he referred me a job opening at his company. When I was offered the job, the salary was under what I make now (goal was to be the same salary or slightly higher). I ultimately decided not to take the job because I did not want to lose any money, for various reasons that I won’t explain here. 

Friend has been telling me I’m greedy, entitled, etc for expecting the salary I did. 

These encounters always make me feel confused. I feel like I’m missing something. I have the experience, my desired salary is right around the industry average, I don’t feel like it’s a ridiculous expectation. 

No matter how much I tried to explain my situation, justify myself, etc, my friend stood firm in their belief of me. 

I don’t know. Its lonely. I feel crazy. I felt confident going into this and now I feel like I have a warped perception of reality and expect too much. ",2,1764121571.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False

1p6v1gs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6v1gs,Poker Night: Character Rundown,"Decided to give a rundown of each of the characters in my ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" reboot/sequel:

**Angel Dust**

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees. Angel Dust will also gain a new outfit based on his get up in the episode ""Masquerade"". Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding the staff of the Hazbin Hotel, hell itself, and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Niffty seeing a bug on the losing opponent, and being sicked onto them.

**Quotes**

* “Aww, look at you, putting in the big-boy chips.” - Reaction to player betting
* “Careful, sweetheart, if you bet any higher you might grow a spine.” - Reaction to player raising
* “You call *that* a raise? I’ve seen johns more threatening.” - Raising
* “Oh, honey, that bluff is see-througher than my work outfits.” - Calling a bluff
* “Heh heh, pal, I know a bluff when I see one. Call.” - Calling a bluff
* “Holy shit!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

**Zoe**

The resident eldritch horror turned fandom enthusiast of Spooky Academy. Once an eldritch horror that lived inside a totem named Z’gord, it was released and ended up being shown the wonders of high school, making it decide to live as a high school girl named Zoe. Zoe is a HUGE enjoyer of fandom culture, including fanart, fanfiction, and shipping culture (her favorite ship being Naruto X Garfield).

Zoe is a wildcard when it comes to poker. She often bets and calls randomly with abandon.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Zoe will choose to place her fanfic “Liam Prom”. Should the player win Liam Prom, they will win a wig based on Zoe’s hair in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Monster Prom themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Spooky Academy, with the school’s student body roaming the Inventory. Zoe will also gain a new outfit that is a cosplay of Garfield. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Zoe’s adventures at Spooky Academy/Monster Con and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Polly Geist and Scott Howl (the PRANK MASTERZ) pulling a dangerous prank on the losing opponent.

**The Spy**

The shapeshifting, disappearing frenchman assassin. Cigarette in one hand, butterfly knife in the other, The Spy is an international man of mystery who deals in infiltration, deception, and psychological warfare. Whether he’s impersonating an enemy, hiding in plain sight, or backstabbing a heavy, The Spy operates with cool composure, impeccable style, and minimal effort.

When it comes to poker, the Spy is the hardest to read out of each character. He keeps his composer and usually checks and calls and doesn’t bet or raise until the end of the river. He also knows when to fold as well as when somebody’s bluffing

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Spy will choose to place the Dead Ringer. Should the player win the Dead Ringer, they will win a special casino themed outfit for the Spy in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Team Fortress 2 themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes 2Fort, with the tournament being held in BLU team’s intelligence room. Spy will also gain a new outfit that changes his outfit to a casino inspired get up.

* “Was there ever a doubt?” - Wins a hand
* “Merde!” - Loosing
* “Do not act so cocky, you’ve only got lucky” - Lost a hand

**Sonar**

The Superhero Dispatch Network’s resident batboy/crypto bro. Once a Harvard graduate turned supervillain, Sonar orchestrated some of the biggest Silicon Valley investment frauds in US history. After being arrested, he decided to turn his life around by joining the SDN’s (Superhero Dispatch Network) phoenix program that’s dedicated to reforming.

Despite his attitude, Sonar is very calculative when it comes to poker. He tries his best to plan for every possibility, but has a tendency to be blind sided when the pot gets big enough.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Sonar will choose to place an SDN coffee mug. Should the player win the mug, they will win an SDN shirt and tie for the Scout in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Dispatch themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the SDN building, with members of Z-Team roaming the Inventory. Sonar will also gain a new outfit where he is in a detective inspired get up. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Sonar’s adventures with the Z-Team and shows new elimination cutscenes involving different members of the Z-Team removing the losing opponent from the tournament.

Should the player equip the same Helluva Boss themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Ozzie’s, with residents of the Lust Ring roaming the Inventory. Spy will also gain a new outfit where he is wearing a more revealing outfit.

Everything I’ve built from Draconic Wicca (2011) to The Draconic Path (2012), my Coffee Time series (2011), Dragon FireRose (2005), and the Chantry Tradition™ (2025) has always been shared publicly with clear, timestamped records on my YouTube channel and now across multiple platforms.

I believe in transparent authorship.
If I created it, you can see when, where, and how.

Whether he’s impersonating an enemy, hiding in plain sight, or backstabbing a heavy, The Spy operates with cool composure, impeccable style, and minimal effort.

When it comes to poker, the Spy is the hardest to read out of each character. He keeps his composer and usually checks and calls and doesn’t bet or raise until the end of the river. He also knows when to fold as well as when somebody’s bluffing

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Spy will choose to place the Dead Ringer. Should the player win the Dead Ringer, they will win a special casino themed outfit for the Spy in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Team Fortress 2 themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes 2Fort, with the tournament being held in BLU team’s intelligence room. Spy will also gain a new outfit that changes his outfit to a casino inspired get up. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Spy’s battles with RED team and shows new elimination cutscenes involving the BLU Engineer firing a rocket sentry at the losing opponent.

I'll go first. I'm (older) Gen Z. My discretionary spending is capped to about a total of $400-500 per month. I live with my parents. For me, discretionary consists of BJJ membership, regular gym, eating out, and video games a few months.

The BJJ and my normal gym is something I can't really put a leash on in terms of expenses. My reasoning is that it helps me get moving and be in shape, and I meet people/interact with my regular friends.  It's not draining me but it costs me about $210 per month. 

I only eat out when friends invite me to go out, otherwise I'm packing all my lunches or grabbing tinned/packaged food (or a rotisserie chicken) from Coles or Woolies. Eating out has just gotten ridiculously expensive imo. Even if I do eat out, I try to limit it $25 a plate. 

I always try to buy video games as cheap as I can - either on sale online or at EB Games. I'm penny pinching as is - at least video fames give a bit of entertainment. Never buy it new from places like JB Hifi. 

I only buy coffee from outside very rarely - I do not buy it everyday. 

I don't drink or smoke (or do drugs). Party life is out of the question (because it goes against my religion) so I'd imagine I'm saving heaps there.

I’m Zane. I’ve been deep in the commercial equipment manufacturing side of the food industry for over ten years, and honestly, seeing good businesses fail because of bad equipment choices is painful.

When I talk to new founders (coffee, bakery, specialty food), I always notice the same few budget mistakes. It's not about being cheap; it's about **misplacing your money** on the wrong assets.

Here are the three costly equipment traps I want you all to avoid:



# 1. 🚨 Trap #1: Chasing SIZE over Consistency



The newbie logic: *""I need the biggest machine possible to handle future demand!""*

* **My Reality Check:** That huge, cheap mixer or standard-issue oven is often a recipe for product inconsistency. Big equipment is only efficient if it performs perfectly. If your oven has hot spots, you’re not saving money; you’re **ruining batches**. I’d rather have two smaller, high-control ovens that guarantee quality than one giant machine that keeps me guessing.
* **The Lesson:** **Your money should buy precision, not capacity.** Prioritize features like independent heating controls and top-tier insulation. Quality control is your brand's biggest asset.



# 2. 💸 Trap #2: Settling for ""Close Enough"" Sizing



This one drives me crazy. Founders buy a standard machine that's *almost* right, just because the manufacturer doesn't offer slight size modifications.

* **My Reality Check:** That machine that’s 3 inches too wide costs you money every single month. It wastes valuable floor space (which you pay rent for!), it creates awkward workflows, and it reduces your staff's speed. You are literally paying for inefficiency.
* **The Lesson:** **Treat your kitchen layout like gold.** If a supplier can't adjust equipment dimensions to perfectly fit your space, they are forcing *your dream* to fit *their standard box*. This is where flexibility saves you rent and labor costs in the long run.



# 3. 📉 Trap #3: Buying ""Discount"" Refrigeration



Look, I get it. Refrigeration is boring. You want to spend money on the sexy mixer.

* **My Reality Check:** Refrigeration is the **insurance policy** for your entire inventory and your compliance record. I’ve seen cheap compressors fail overnight, wiping out $5,000 worth of specialty ingredients. That single failure costs more than buying the right unit in the first place.
* **The Lesson:** **Never compromise on refrigeration quality or warranty.** It's the silent guardian of your business and your sanity.



# Need to Talk Supply Chain?



If you're finding this deep dive into equipment sourcing helpful, especially if you're wrestling with the tricky supply chain for **baking or specialty food equipment**, you might find value in the community I'm trying to build.

It's a focused space where we dive into manufacturing processes, flexible sourcing (like low MOQs and customization), and technical decisions:

1p6uwod,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6uwod,Poker Night: Character Rundown,"Decided to give a rundown of each of the characters in my ""Poker Night at the Inventory"" reboot/sequel:

**Angel Dust**

A famous demon drag queen pornstar/hardcore gangster who died in the 1940s. Starring in many a raunchy film, soon realized that it was time for a change of scenery and became the first patron of the Hazbin Hotel, a place ran by the daughter of Lucifer himself, Charlie Morningstar, as a way to (hopefully) rehabilitate sinners and allow them to ascend up into heaven. Angel Dust is a carefree, crass, and lecherous spider-demon, with the twin occupations of violent gangster and drag queen porn star, who loves living off crime and vice in Hell. Except, his situation is not nearly as amazing as he pretends, and he might actually have more than just pragmatic reasons to stay at Charlie’s hotel.

Angel Dust’s strategy when playing poker basically flirt first, play second. He often uses his flirtatious acts as a way to throw off his opponents. Outside of that, he bluffs often and makes periodic bets throughout the river. Despite that, he’s very observant and a wiz at reading people.

Should it be his turn to place a bounty, Angel will choose to place one of his tommy guns. Should the player win the tommy gun, they will win the Angelic Drumgun for the Sniper in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Hazbin Hotel themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes the titular Hazbin Hotel, with sinners roaming around the Inventory and Niffty rushing around trying to kill every bug she sees. Angel Dust will also gain a new outfit based on his get up in the episode ""Masquerade"". Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding the staff of the Hazbin Hotel, hell itself, and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Niffty seeing a bug on the losing opponent, and being sicked onto them.

**Quotes**

* “Aww, look at you, putting in the big-boy chips.” - Reaction to player betting
* “Careful, sweetheart, if you bet any higher you might grow a spine.” - Reaction to player raising
* “You call *that* a raise? I’ve seen johns more threatening.” - Raising
* “Oh, honey, that bluff is see-througher than my work outfits.” - Calling a bluff
* “Heh heh, pal, I know a bluff when I see one. Call.” - Calling a bluff
* “Holy shit!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

**Zoe**

The resident eldritch horror turned fandom enthusiast of Spooky Academy. Once an eldritch horror that lived inside a totem named Z’gord, it was released and ended up being shown the wonders of high school, making it decide to live as a high school girl named Zoe. Zoe is a HUGE enjoyer of fandom culture, including fanart, fanfiction, and shipping culture (her favorite ship being Naruto X Garfield).

Zoe is a wildcard when it comes to poker. She often bets and calls randomly with abandon.

Should it be her turn to place a bounty, Zoe will choose to place her fanfic “Liam Prom”. Should the player win Liam Prom, they will win a wig based on Zoe’s hair in Team Fortress 2.

Should the player equip the same Monster Prom themed chips, cards, and table, the Inventory alters so that it becomes Spooky Academy, with the school’s student body roaming the Inventory. Zoe will also gain a new outfit that is a cosplay of Garfield. Doing this also unlocks new conversations regarding Zoe’s adventures at Spooky Academy/Monster Con and shows new elimination cutscenes involving Polly Geist and Scott Howl (the PRANK MASTERZ) pulling a dangerous prank on the losing opponent.

**Quotes**

* “Ooooh, spicy bet! I vibe with the drama. Call!” - Calling
* “Wow, those are a lot of chips… Welp, time to do some calling!” - Calling
* “I’m investing in this narrative arc. Raise!” - Raising
* “OMG!” - Reaction to large bet/all in

* “Come on, Zoe, think of all the merch you can get… (sigh) I’m out” - Folding
* “Nope! Even the Great Old Ones would think this hand sucks.” - Folding
* “Hell ya! Zoe for the win!” - Winning the pot
* “I would like to thank probability, hubris, and dumb luck.” - Winning the pot
* “This reminds me of a tabletop RPG I played with Polly, only with fewer orgies. So far.” -Idle

If you’re in Shibuya during winter, here are three events locals actually go to — not the overly touristy stuff, just the ones that make the area feel genuinely “December in Shibuya.”

# 1. Ao-no-Dokutsu (Blue Cave) Illumination — Shibuya to Yoyogi Park

Yeah, this one is famous — but locals still go.  
The trick is visiting after 9pm, when the crowds thin out and the blue-lit avenue feels almost quiet. It’s one of the few moments when Shibuya feels calm in December. Great for a slow walk with hot coffee.

**Event Overview**

**Event Period**  
December 4 (Thu), 2025 – December 25 (Thu), 2025

**Event Hours**  
17:00–22:00  
Please note that illumination hours and event details may change due to rain or other circumstances.

**Location**  
From Shibuya Kōendōri Street to the Keyaki (Zelkova) Avenue in [Yoyogi Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yoyogi+Park/@35.6700692,139.6923907,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x60188cb479620a33:0x34bcc78ce7f8bf3e!8m2!3d35.6700649!4d139.6949656!16zL20vMDNjcWtq!5m1!1e2?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

Locals love this one because it’s small, casual, and easy to drop by after shopping or work.  
Expect hot wine, indie brands, small performances, and a very “neighborhood winter festival” vibe. It’s not flashy — just cozy, seasonal, and very Shibuya.

1p6uvjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1p6uvjy/jem_english_sets_things_on_fire_campfire_1125/,Jem English Sets Things on Fire (Campfire - 11/25),"Sleep does not come easily to the son of Hebe, at least not naturally. His work as a medic is only one reason for this. His time at New Argos, Key Tower, and Camp Fish-Blood is another. So he uses potions. Tonics and tinctures that induce sleep artificially and magically. Truth be told, the process and potency of it are incredible, and Jem has found his interest in the magic of Alchemy repeatedly peaked after experiencing it firsthand. 

Today, however, his lack of sleep has less to do with the aforementioned reasons and more to do with duty. He has, for lack of a better word, been slacking on his duties as a counselor since returning from the undersea sieges, and this is his chance to rectify that at least partially.

Settling near the communal campfire, the son of Hebe sets out blankets for those who do not bring their own, mugs of hot chocolate, the homemade kind, not the kind sold in those insufferable packets at grocery stores, and coffee present for anyone who decides they need to be warmed from the inside out. 

He also, with his head held high with grim determination, slams the sharp point of a sign down into the dirt near the campfire. The sign states: 



> Do **NOT** sing campfire songs unless those within earshot have consented. Any unreasonably terrible singing that assaults the ears of those attending this campfire will be punished by way of trial by combat. Thus, if you wish to sing, make sure to come armed. - The Hebe Counselor

Then, with his preparations finished, the brown-haired demigod settles down near the campfire and forces himself to grab a mug of hot chocolate. The drink is far too sweet, but the added spices and thicker nature of the liquid mean it warms him fairly well. Blowing a tuft of too-long hair out of his eyes, he sighs, his breath just barely misting in the slight chill. 

He does check to see if his sword is settled nearby lest someone break out into song. This is a campfire, not a poorly thought-out sequel to a movie that made too much money. Grey eyes narrow and scan any of the new arrivals with scrutiny. He is prepared. ",3,1764120951.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

I have tried redirecting, more walks, more training but if he decides he wants something and now he's relentless. Lately the trigger is those edible chews they last him anywhere 20min-4 45min sessions with them. I don't want to give them to him everybday as they should be a sometimes thing, but as he's gotten bigger (15lbs at times brought home at 9 weeks to over 80lbs now) he just goes through them so fast. 

He's pretty much free fed, the appriopriate daily amount is put out in 2 meals a day. We also give him raw fruit and veg. 

He also bites the table when the cats are getting attention, when I am trying to clean the house, this behavior used to be much worse but he has been getting better. I feel that some of it has to do with my partner who is not as constructive with training and allowing him to do things that he knows I wouldn't allow, instead of a warning and correction or redirection or interveening he just keeps shouting his name over and over saying no. I have talked to him about this multiple times. It's wrap up season for construction and I am exhausted. I have tried so much, I don't want to give in to every tantrum, demand, or crate him. 

Food related distractions work but then he starts demanding those. What can I do to help deter this frustration biting of my poor tables in the living room. ",1,1764120856.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

1p6uk52,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/1p6uk52/dish_my_journey_so_far/,DISH. My journey. So far,"A few people asked me about DISH. I typed out all my tips over a coffee this morning, annd found myself adding to it throughout the day. It’s a lot, and I decided to make it a post. I am not a medical professional and certainly not your medical professional. Bear that in mind in mind.

\* You can read about DISH and see exemplar CT scans here: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521694220300449](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521694220300449). My CTs look just like this going back over more than two years. I’m now 51.

\* My symptoms have included, in order of first appearance: premature heartbeats ACV/PCVs, back spasms, vasovagal syncope (fainted once, got close a couple more times), aching tension in thoracic spine, chest pains in random places, loss of range of motion, tingling/numbness in fingers or feet

\* Full cardio work up in 2023 was all clear. Finally diagnosed over three years after my first symptoms, by MRI + CT thoracic studies and orthopedic surgeon. I had to learn a lot, and advocate for myself to get here, because it could have been picked up earlier (particularly by careless radiologists looking for other things, DISH is quite obvious)

—— All my tips, from year 1 of work so far ——

Bear in mind I don’t know you, your habits, your health. These are from my experience so far. I suspect quite a bit will resonate nevertheless If you have a diagnosis of DISH. If you suspect this for yourself, talk to your Dr.

\* First, your life is not over. Many people - mostly men - over 50 have DISH. Many never know. It’s asymptomatic for many, a good sign, and likely under-diagnosed in the general population. It is usually relieving to be diagnosed if you’ve been symptomatic. 

\* DISH seems to be about metabolic syndrome, flexibility, and strength. Tips for those things that are working for me follow.

\* Lose weight. Do whatever you need to do. Tirzepatide/Ozempic, dietary changes. Lots of walking and some running if you can. Incorporate these as lifestyle changes long term, not a “must do” chore. Drop the GLP1 after loss and use lifestyle changes to maintain.

\* Alcohol use correlates strongly with metabolic syndrome. Do whatever you need to do. Naltrexone + behavior modification is excellent. Switch alcohol to something else in the ritual of daily consumption. Green/herbal tea, fizzy water, anything but soda.

\* Supplements - consider hydrolyzed collagen, collagen peptides (support ligament and tendon recomposition), turmeric, fish oil, magnesium glycinate (inflammation/relaxation + sleep), all supporting a good diet. Cheat/treat meals and drinks help the mood from time to time.

\* Medical supplements - keep a supply of gabapentin 300mg nearby at all times. This cuts neuralgic (sharp nerve pains) fairly well and will be required on hand for flareups. Ibuprofen can help, but keep consumption under control for sake of kidneys and gut health. Corticosteroids injected by an interventionist pain specialist has some real risks, but is also possible, try not to rely on this as they last a few months while you have a life-long condition. Diclofenac topical (Voltaren) cream can help a bit.

\* Heat, treatments - hot showers followed by 60 seconds cold shower gets blood and fluids going nicely in the back. Hot baths can also help. Most devices other than the black foam roller seem to be hokum. Massage from a CMT might help you.

\* DISH primarily affects the anterior right side of the spine. Heart and aorta are too close to the left, and it somehow avoids this area. Symptoms often include “crunchiness” toward the right of the thoracic spine, sporadic muscle spasms thoracic right of spine, sporadic nerve pains either side of chest, sporadic finger tingling or numbness either side or numbness in a foot. This is all nerve root - not cordal stenosis - impingement in the back.

\* Flexibility - start with PT assessment and prescribed movements to get the thoracic spine moving. Do these daily like it’s religion. PT is costly but five visits or less will teach you what you need.

\* Flexibility - get a black foam roller and befriend it. Gentle rolling and then graduate to stretching OVER the roller daily / multiple times daily. Roll up and down spine to warm up. Then 30 seconds per two vertebrae stretch the hips and shoulders towards the floor. You will hear/feel spine movements - good. Beware this can trigger back spasms if you sit up fast, so slowly roll your back another minute to come out of this stretching. Learn your body’s reactions and work around them.

\* Flexibility - yoga. It’s not just for women. “Thread the needle” is excellent. Cobra and Cat + Cow too. Work up to these over time, add them to your roller sessions.

\* Strength - gym time - rest of life. This is no longer about lifting heavy, major growth, and macho business. It is about reactivating problem areas in your core and being as fit as you can there, for the rest of your life.

\* Strength - basic core moves include lighter weight higher rep count chest press, shoulder press, leg press, seated rows / various width pull downs. And arms for ego points. Avoid deadlifts and squats - overload the spine - like the plague. Maybe lighter rack deadlifts (shorter length) if you’re fit and healthy, but save these for later. Learn/practice/exercise “zero care” for what other gym rats say or think. They don’t have DISH.

\* Strength - Core foci, lighter weights regularly; woodchoppers both down and up 45°. Turkish get ups, start with the first half sit up only, graduate to standing up if you get real fit and feel like doing it. Ab crunches and curls, Bicycle kicks. All good. If you are walking lots cardio machines are unneeded. Some people need TV so cardio machines are good for them.

\* Golf - if you play. Swinging with the arms and back will trigger symptoms, spasms, and worsen your condition. Get a coach and fix your swing to be lower body powered + left arm pull. The above combined with a good swing and rest from golf whenever needed, means you can still play.

\* Nerves - will often become accustomed to a “new normal” condition over a long period, a year plus. If the condition progresses much or quickly, there won’t be a new normal, and they won’t. All the above is about minimizing your DISH progression. (I am specifically NOT speaking about spinal cord issues here)

\* Life - you have this for the rest of your life now. The above is a significant modification to most DISH sufferers lifestyles in order to minimize any further progress of thoracic skeletal hyperostosis and maximise enjoyment of life. It usually means dropping old habits and things you believe are you or that you love, and embracing new ones as the new you for better health. Do whatever you need to do, in order to get there.",1,1764120054.0,backpain,1,1.0,False

[Whoops All Bards!](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/whoops-all-bards) 

You put out a quest call, put a poster on the jobs board, and got ready to attack the dungeon. Only problem, the only people who answered were bards. And you’re a bard! But the quest has a time limit, so you’re going into the dungeon and you’ll just have to figure it out as you go! 

**What I Like About This One:**

There aren’t enough games that make violence a non-answer. I mean, the number of times violence solves my problems in a normal day? Zero per day. The number of times seduction solves my problems? Very closely approaching zero… But my whole job is diplomacy! Diplomacy is how I handle all of my problems! So the idea of a game where beating monsters up is verboten appeals to me. 

This is probably the worst version of the roll xd20, take the middle, that I’ve put together so far but I still kinda love it in its ridiculousness. 

**What I’d Do Differently Next Time:** 

I’d probably make the failures not equal death early on. I had to come up with stuff to get around it for some of the mechanics that came later, but it was funny in the moment.

I've been in bed for two days because I don't know how to make sense of it, know who's right.

In essence, I just moved out of my home & went to a new city in a similar area. Within the first 3 weeks I met a woman reading her Bible at the coffee shop and asked about where she went to church. She guided me to her churches instagram and soon enough I was at a Bible Study with them. It all seemed normal except a few people introduced themselves as disciples which I thought was weird at first. After the seemingly normal session I was asked, pressured almost, by a few of the ""disciples"" to study the Bible with them privately. Just I & them (3 sometimes 4 of them). We would meet Sundays and talk the Bible, but right at first I found red flags because they only wanted me to speak. They didn't care to share their beliefs on the subject matter they just wanted my input, like they were assessing me. After each session they would call me to accepting certain doctrines. It felt like I was passing tests.

Come to the 4th study and immediately, despite being baptized in water & studying the Bible for 7 years, repenting nightly, they called me a false teacher and claimed to me I wasn't saved. I've met with them twice in regard to why they said that and I still don't fully understand it. They we're talking about the order in which I got baptized. As in, I didn't know when I got baptized that I needed to be actively discipling and creating more disciples — Mathew 28. They said I was a bad tree because I hadn't baptized anyone and that was evidence of my fruit, they said I was a wolf in sheeps clothing because I didn't know all of Jesus' teachings and believed somebody could be saved outside of a water baptism, as in taking communion or being baptized by the Spirit.

I've heard Jesus' voice thousands of times. I repent every single night of my life. Never once in my entire walk did I ever second guess the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, after getting baptized, taking communion earnestly, faithfully, & sentimentally hundreds of times, & having had hundreds and hundreds of encounters. They claimed the pastor who baptized me wasn't saved either & that if I wanted to be truly saved, I needed to be baptized through their church with the understanding that my goal as a Christian is to make more disciples and if I didn't they said they can guide me to another church, as I will no longer be welcome to study with them anymore.

I am remarkably confused. This is the most spiritually shaken I've been on my entire walk. He uses all things together for good so I will come out of this stronger, but as of now I am having trouble discerning my placement with God, if I am a false teacher, if these guys have any validity to what they're saying or in general, what I should even do.

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? Should I get baptized again just in case? Is this a cult? They know their word so well & spoke with so much authority they've done what I never thought possible — allow me to question my relationship with my Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. Anything helps.

I've been loving it because it's convenient and fast but makes good coffee.

I just use James Hoffman's recipe, and it's been working quite fine for me. I have a Kingrinder K6 and grind quite fine (60 on the Kingrinder) and use a 60 grams to a liter ratio, just under 95 degrees for medium roast and boiling for light roast. As far as I know, very standard stuff. I think my extraction is about right.

This summer, I was on holiday with my partner, and naturally I took my new Aeropress with me. My partner also wanted coffee, so on that holiday I ended up making an overfull aeropress every day. Did everything according to the usual recipe: the same steep time, the same 60:1000 ratio, just using 300ml water instead of the 215ml I usually make (so 18g instead of 13g) so I could make two 150ml cups. The coffee tasted excellent, but I didn't think much of it at first since I had bought beans on holiday so I couldn't compare.

When I got home, the same beans didn't taste as good. I figured it must have been the water or something. Until the other day my partner asked me to make her a coffee again and the coffee tasted much better with an overfull 300ml Aeropress.

The overfull Aeropress tastes much (forgive my lacking vocabulary) brighter, I could taste the notes in the coffee *much* more clearly. On par with what I get in my favorite coffee shop. The small Aeropress is quite dull in comparison. It tastes fine, but doesn't have a lot of character. But again, I don't think the small Aeropress is over (or under-) extracted, since it doesn't taste excessively bitter or acidic.

What could be the difference here? Is there some way I could replicate it in my smaller cup? I've tried tweaking grind size and steep time (a little) but it doesn't really seem to have much effect. I tried stirring more, but it just resulted in overextracted coffee. What else can I try?",3,1764119484.0,AeroPress,2,1.0,False
