1pbbd9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1pbbd9q/how_do_people_only_use_one_roll_of_toilet_paper/,How do people only use one roll of toilet paper per week?,"Help me out - I genuinely don't understand 😩

I tend to go through 2-4 rolls per week, on my own. I've had a few moments recently where it's become clear to me that this is unusual. A friend recently received one thin, sad roll for a 3 week hotel stay... and was so unbothered by this she turned down a second one, like ""oh, I'm okay? There's one in my room already right?""  

That could be explained by her expecting to receive more each week, but I googled it and some people on the internet say they do use one roll in 2-3 weeks. 

I must be doing something seriously different to other people...!? Can anyone tell me what am I doing different?   

Here's all the things I can think of that might impact how much I use: 

- I live alone. I don't host guests often.
- I WFH, am single and am quite a homebody so I'm at home a lot. Like pretty much all day and night. 
- I menstruate 5-6 days every month
- I use double-length rolls, of decent 3 ply quality - not super plush or anything, but not cheap ones. 
- I guess I do drink a lot of water so usually pee probably 5-7 times a day (?) I take medications that dehydrate so I drink at least 2L a day. 
- I drink 1 coffee a day, no tea, no soda, no energy drinks or anything weird 
- I think I am a fairly good pooper (can't believe I'm fucking writing this on reddit) I usually go 1-2 times per day, and probably 8 out of 10 of them are good quality poops, the kind that don't leave anything behind
- I have a bum gun already, but only use it for poop and during my period. But I find I use more paper when I use it because I need to dry off? 
- I fold / roll, don't scrunch 
- I am 36yo and not particularly saggy or wrinkly down there, I think?! Maybe I am though? 
- I am kinda fat, maybe it's that? 

I think I usually do wipe multiple times because I like to be really clean and make sure I am. Is nobody else doing that? 

Depending on the thickness of the paper, i use probably 5 squares if it's good paper and 8-10 if it's bad paper. But if I use less then my fingers go through the paper, or it gets wet through to where my fingers are. Is this something that doesn't really bother other people? I'm not like super fussy about bodily functions, I use a menstrual cup, I'm not afraid of pee on my hands I guess, I just don't really feel clean if the paper got so wet it's tearing through, and that will then cause me to get more paper and wipe again, so just grabbing less paper doesn't seem to solve the problem.  

If there is poop on the paper I will discard it and get a whole new piece. Is that abnormal?

Or is this one of those things where there is some weird shame or social rules around it, and people are possibly just pretending to use less TP than they really do or something? 

I know I'm being really autistic about this (not figuratively, I literally am autistic). I would just like to have some framework for what is happening here. 

I want to believe maybe i just have high standards for cleanliness, but maybe I just have a big flappy ass wrinkly vj and I drink way too much water?? Help

Only quotes and reels here and there. For me October ended with 3-4 bad news in 3d and I decided to immerse myself into understanding the law properly through study for this month.

This is my Month's experience. Week 1: I read Neville's works.

Feeling Is the Secret - To feel a thing intensely and then rest confidently in that feeling is the way to success. ...Assume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue feeling it until that which you feel objectifies itself....You never attract what you want. You always attract what you are.

The Power of Awareness (Faith) - To attempt to change circumstances before you change your imaginal activity is to struggle against the nature of things....A state is an attitude of mind, a state of belief. It is the power that manifests...You rise to a higher level of being only by assuming a higher concept of yourself. If you will not imagine yourself as other than what you are, then you remain as you are....“Disregard appearances, conditions, in fact all evidence of your senses that deny the fulfillment of your desire.

From Lecture: The Pruning Shears of Revision - There is no one to change but self

2. Along with this, I also watched Erik (The Power of I am). I AM or I AM NOT. MAKE MANIFESTATION SIMPLE AGAIN. They are yours, You cannot fail Your Memories are Contagious

My Intentions/Beliefs/Assumptions - I realized and reluctantly ACCEPTED that all my life is created by me. I am the doer as well as the one experiencing. I wrote everything that is wrong in my life and what i truly dislike and questioned it. I did some Shadow Work, asked myself tough questions.

I affirmed - I am loved, chosen, prioritized a lot. Affirmations specific to my desires as well on career, love, basically Outcome focused.

I wrote a dummy script on what ""my life is going to be like""

Results: Heavy doubt, Wavering, Questioning my desires and mostly myself, 3d showed the opposite.  realized I am still not following the law or embodying and questioned it. I also was swinging, understanding life but then unable to bear the weight of it.

To be honest, nothing changed externally except I understood the mistakes in my manifestation journey. Random facts and beliefs from all the posts here and there. My doubts and dependency on techniques and my desires.

Week 2: I watched the Lectures. Faith is the loyalty to Unseen , Signs and Wonders, Imaginal Acts, Mental Diet. I truly cannot stress how life changing the lectures are, I listened to them before sleeping or in mornings.

Erik's Success Stories Compilations - [https://youtu.be/zH-9\_m0aCtc?si=G7kl1WG8ngVOXs\_m](https://youtu.be/zH-9_m0aCtc?si=G7kl1WG8ngVOXs_m) Success Stories from this Sub, i love: Believe in the End, till you get it. How I turned my entire life around using Neville's teachings in under 2 months [https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1alg6wg/i\_manifested\_250000\_by\_practicing\_wealth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1alg6wg/i_manifested_250000_by_practicing_wealth/) and honestly, many more!

My Intentions/Beliefs/Assumptions - I started to think if all this people are living the life of their dreams despite the absurdity and unlikely, Why can't I? I questioned my desires, thoughts, beliefs to its core - Why do I assume person x won't listen to me? Why I believe I'm not pretty? Why I feel so and so about a person? Why despite my great qualities I get angry and frustrated easily?.... everything. I saw my pre-existing beliefs and notions of self even the tiniest thoughts on weather and expectations. I started to trace my thoughts and reflected effects on 3d clearly. Eg. When my mother didn't listen to my advice on something I always thought 'She never listens to me even when I am right. Why bother '. To which she would reply after some time that she knows I'm right but she is going to do what she likes.

Results (Mostly observations of my thoughts): If I believed I don't feel good about myself, I would experience pimple or a zit in that day, or a dress would fit tight.

When I doubted my career, i would hear people and my father question me about my future and what am I gonna do? Basically, law working from smaller to bigger shifts.

This is where i got truly fed up, Wanting to give up and not. I kept reading Neville's notes I made, and other smaller notes on Manifestation. I realized that for everyone, It sucks to admit that how much our lives has always been in our hands. Yes, we don't born into our families. Our childhood is shaped.

Our life goes through its own pace based on our opportunities, privilege, almost everything in life starts with a setup which is predestined. We are players on a game already created, we often feel we are being played, but forget that we are the player in the game and a Player simply plays. Game is the same for us all, yes with different set of rules and advantages but a player can always turn the game around.

I would also say that several celebs manifested their successes. Shah Rukh Khan, one of the topmost Bollywood actor has said several times about How he is last of the stars, him manifesting his current house near sea etc. He is final boss ngl. And this is where, Shifts began.

Week 3: I reread my notes on Neville. Kind of getting fatigued of constant information stream. What i held onto during the week -

* A mood is a state of belief.
* This is a shadow; the cause is within me.
* Am I being loyal to the state I’ve chosen? (THIS IS THE MOST HELPFUL & STRESSFUL but it will show you were you are conciously)
* The feeling of the wish fulfilled must be relaxed and natural.”...“The end” is not a scene. “The end” is an identity.
* What you do after you imagine is more important than the imagining itself. I embodied some of these, some i read again and again and tried to and fail but i am unlocking their meaning and its place in myself. Watched these videos on Erik and Nero Knowledge. How Clutter explains the old god manifesting 4 pillars of Identity Manifestation [https://youtu.be/nB5gkASRiGE?si=IzcfsblwlyPyYbro](https://youtu.be/nB5gkASRiGE?si=IzcfsblwlyPyYbro) [https://youtu.be/4a73FmcoM5U?si=F3GAZI\_m5UwpfMN5](https://youtu.be/4a73FmcoM5U?si=F3GAZI_m5UwpfMN5)

Also started listening to subliminals at night, recorded my affirmations just once and listened for a day or two during chores.

By the end of the week, I realized I am consuming all of this to sort of escape under spiritual awareness. Like I know this and let me have it all just cause of it.

And also, i got sick of seeing the exact same meaning of what manifestation is and how it works in every video and lecture. Because it really isnt rocket science, it comes down to who we are and do we recognize us beneath all the layers?

My Affirmations - I changed them from desire focused to my self concept ones. Twice a day. I am (my name). I am kind, I am chosen. Life chooses me. I am loved, I am love myself. I am beautiful. I am fit and healthy. I am strong and secure. Life flows through me. Everything works out for me. I am enough. I am everything.

I tried Thought Transmission on my desires, twice or thrice.

I read about Non duality more and more. And started to understand about ego, awareness etc.

Results: 

I questioned myself , What kind of person would I be without my desires or with no desires in me?  Would I still deem myself all this adjectives without having the cover of desires to hold it? Are my desires me or do i make my desires? Does it matter if honey is in a jar or a cup, at the end of the day it's the honey that's sweet. I truly started to go in. It was uncomfortable at times. 

There was a day - I think 19th or 20th Nov when I cried one day thinking about my old life. But later i could just feel something left from me. 

I focused on what kind of person would i want to be. 

By the end of week these happened: 

\- I received an apology from an old bully (15 years back from my school) and while I always announced to the world that she deserves the worst. In that moment i forgave and moved on. 

\- I had a sort of an uncomfortable relationship with a relative. I started to slowly see her side as well and their families, end up becoming a middle man to resist the beef. It's in progress but I feel good around her now, she is good to me. there is no longer any stress. 

\- I slowly started to see visible progress in gym after two weeks. I confronted my issue of emotional eating heads on. 

\- I stopped labelling eating as an act and slowly allowed myself my favourite foods while also doing gym for my body and not lose weight. I focused on how my body feels. It is an uncomfortable process. I did relapsed later and emotionally ate but things are progressing better than in last 10 years. I lost some good weight (around 10kgs in 8 months) and it's not something I feel proud of but rather just thankful of because my body now can move better and breathe. I

\- slowly started to take time out for myself without isolating myself. My time with myself feels special. 

\- I felt lighter and lighter, chatter in my head about my 3d circumstances and all the stuff not moving just stopped. I felt like I'm a cloud floating simply. It's a beautiful state to be in. 

\- I am able to identify and let go of negative beliefs, thoughts even comfortably getting into hidden ones or questioning self. 

Week 4: I didn't read, watch or even listened to anything just lived and remember the techniques. I applied the techniques sincerely staying in who i envisioned myself to be. 

I held the image of myself steady. 

Simply thought to myself, That life is beautiful, it shows me beauty. I am becoming myself and I'm so proud of myself. I am growing and changing. I belong everywhere and anywhere. I can trust myself. 

This was not a regular practice these thoughts just naturally appeared for me. Sometimes, i said them to myself. I naturally woke up some day and thought, Oh, I am loved.

 Results: I saw a lot of Angel numbers, synchronicities, signs initially. 

\- I got complimented by people, family, Friends lot more than usual. Not just on looks but also my qualities. 

\- I was invited to few parties and a wedding and got told that I'm now everything, by my best friend. It's an affirmation I used and I didn't expect to hear so from her.

\-  I did several instant Manifestations like imagined a lehenga dress in my budget and got it, free coffee, seeing a bird, smaller gifts. 

\- My dream is to a writer, I feel writing is what's gonna hold me through life. I often affirm that I'm gonna change the literary landscape and be one of the greatest. In regards to writing, I saw ideas, thoughts, lines everywhere I went. I was writing, wondering, dreaming every day!! It was insane. I received an invitation by my favourite publication to write something for them for their next issue. 

\- All the things I love and find beautiful appeared ten times more. My favourite kind of flowers on every other Street, small acts of kindness by everyone. People and babies smiling at me frequently, people offering me seat on bus or trains. My cat being more closer to me. More family time with my parents and fun and movies. 

\- My uncle gifted me a home espresso machine because I thought I want to become a coffee aficionado and imagined myself pressing a coffee button to get fresh espresso. Now I do so every morning. My mother who hated coffee and my caffeine addiction now drinks coffee with me every morning.

\-  I looked at my old pictures and saw the same smile returning. For last three years I felt ashamed of myself for gaining weight, breakup, failure but I felt after a such long time a sense of gratitude for myself. In my sad days i could have chosen paths of self destruction and even considered horrible fate for myself but life chose me and I chose it and I am still trusting it. 

\- I feel like myself again without all my ""concrete desires"" yet. And I feel so goddamn loved. I love myself and this is coming from a woman who hated herself, made jokes like No one hates me more than myself etc. during her teens, never believed a compliment, felt she should always succeed etc. I don't know if it's a big deal or not, but to me it is. 

Bigger Successes - 

\-I received the green signal to pursue higher education again, to try again to do my masters. I already sent in my application, daring to dream to live in my favourite city. 

\- I lost some visible inches in a week quickly. All my clothes fitting even well than before. Ate my favourite dishes happily. 

\- I got gifted a book (limited edition) i tried manifesting about five months ago. 

\- I always wanted a guy to hit on me in the gym because gym is a place I felt awkward at. Funnily, I got asked out by two guys and made three four friends as well. Gym feels like second home now, no longer a prison sentence i succumb to daily. 

\- I found out a diary from years ago, where in I wrote that in future I would have my own bedroom and it would have a small tv, wardrobe, lots of books, good sunlight and view and music playing in the background. after I returned to my home two months ago, we were already moving to a new place. and to be honest, i didn't care then... but when I reread my diary and looked around I'm living exactly. my room has all the stuff I wrote and beautiful sunlight. 12 year old me cracked Scripting years ago lol!

\-  My Substack is growing and I found agent for my novel. 

\- My portfolio and urge to learn more but not to be a topper but to learn transformed my relationship with old self who simply loved studies and knowledge. i got complimented by my old professor (who is truly strict and hard to impress) that I've done so much work and she's so proud and amazed by my grit. 

It is strange that all of this unfold in two weeks especially when for the first two weeks it felt like I was fighting for my life. to be honest, there are days when I am still figuring it out. there are desires and Manifestations which I still imagine for myself in future tense (the famous one which draws most of us to Manifestation haha). 

My exact desires haven't revealed themselves yet but I do feel the hold they had on me for years loosening. I am no longer attached, gripped by them. I am no longer stressed, afraid or worried if they happen. I know they're gonna. I know they're inevitable even when those momentary doubts or 3d moments pass through my mind. my desires don't make me or sustain me anymore. I sustain them. I am the cause. i am so they are. and this change reversed years worth of damage i endured.",1,1764591412.0,lawofassumption,1,1.0,False

If you've noticed your smart plug getting really hot, you're probably worried something's wrong. The good news? You can usually fix this problem pretty easily once you know what's causing it.

## Common Reasons Your Smart Plug Gets Too Hot

**You're plugging in too many things.** The biggest mistake people make is connecting power strips or extension cords to their smart plugs. When you do this, you might be pulling more electricity than the plug can handle. Each smart plug has a maximum wattage it can support – usually between 1800 and 3600 watts. Check the label on your device to see its limit.

**High-power appliances are the problem.** Things like space heaters, hair dryers, air conditioners, and coffee makers use tons of electricity. If you're using one of these with your smart plug, that's probably why it's heating up. These devices should go straight into the wall outlet instead.

**The outlet itself has issues.** Sometimes the problem isn't your smart plug at all. Loose outlets, old wiring, or damaged sockets can cause heat buildup. Try plugging your device into a different outlet and see if the problem continues.

**Your smart plug is old or cheaply made.** Not all smart plugs are created equal. Lower quality models or ones that have been used for years might not work as well anymore. The internal components can wear out over time.

## What You Should Do Right Now

First things first – unplug anything that's making your smart plug hot. A overheating plug is a fire hazard, so don't ignore it.

Next, figure out how much power your device needs. Look for a label that shows the wattage. If that number is close to or higher than what your smart plug can handle, you need a different solution.

If you're using older or unreliable smart plugs, it might be time for an upgrade. You can [check out better quality options here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) that are built to handle everyday use safely.

## Preventing Future Problems

Keep your smart plugs in open spaces where air can flow around them. Don't stack things on top of them or shove them behind furniture where heat gets trapped.

Only plug one device directly into each smart plug. No daisy-chaining multiple plugs together or using power strips – this is asking for trouble.

Give your plugs a break from high-demand appliances. Save them for lamps, fans, phone chargers, and other low-power devices that won't strain the system.

Check your plugs every few weeks. If one feels warm to the touch during normal use, something's not right. A working smart plug should stay cool or just slightly warm.

## When to Replace Your Smart Plug

If your smart plug keeps overheating even with low-power devices, smells like burning plastic, or shows any discoloration or melting, throw it away immediately. These are serious warning signs that it's dangerous to keep using.

The same goes if your plug is several years old and starting to act weird. Technology gets better over time, and newer models have better safety features built in.

Ready to upgrade? [Browse reliable smart plugs that won't give you headaches](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug) and keep your home safe.

## Bottom Line

Most smart plug overheating happens because people are asking too much from them. Respect the wattage limits, use them with appropriate devices, and replace them when they show signs of wear. Your smart home should make life easier, not put your house at risk.

Stay safe out there, and remember – if something electrical feels hot enough to make you uncomfortable, trust your gut and unplug it.",1,1764591077.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

The conditions horrified me as I have come from working in contract catering and fully compliant kitchens. Nothing is labeled or dated. Date expired sandwich fillings are scraped off and used again. There is NO cleaning, griddle is used for everything from meat/cheese toastie to next having an almond croissant warmed in the exact same spot. The only fire extinguisher is inaccessible. The main walk-in fridge has mould growing on the shelf's and cardboard lining the floor. Nobody has a contract /written statement, there is no training. The list goes on. 
I submitted a report to the local authority environmental health department last week and this week I have been dropped from the rota, effectively ending my employment. I believe the business owner has been 'tipped off' by the council. 
The last food hygiene rating was issued in September 2025 as 5* , there is no way that anyone competent inspected and awarded a good score. I think there is corruption in the local authority and don't know who else I can report to.

I’ve been in the city for a little while now, and I’m finally admitting to myself that I miss having someone to share the small, silly, and beautiful parts of life with.

About me:
✨ 28M, working in tech (don’t worry, I’m not that type of tech bro)
✨ 5'10, gym + badminton enthusiast, but also a champion nap-taker
✨ Loyal friend, decent cook, terrible dancer
✨ Fluent in English, sarcasm, and knowing exactly when to order dessert

What I’m looking for:
Someone who’s kind, funny in their own way, and open to meeting someone new without awkward pressure. If you enjoy exploring cafés, late-night drives, stand-up shows, street food hunts, or simply debating why Bangalore traffic is a hostile life form — we’ll get along great.

If this sounds like your vibe, drop me a DM or comment!
Worst case: we make a new friend.
Best case: we become each other’s favorite notification. 😊",1,1764590896.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False

TW possibly 


TLDR I keep getting hit on my much older men

I, (20yof) keep getting hit on and asked out by almost exclusively much older men in their 30s-40s. I’ll provide three examples at the top of my head to see if anyone notices a common theme that might be an explanation as to what makes me possibly more vulnerable.

For context, I am 5’1, and very visibly young looking, I’ve even been occasionally mistaken for a minor. I’ve also been told on many occasions that I’m ’very pretty’ (whole lot of good that’s done me 😒) I also am visibly ‘goth-ish’, if that matters.

1) I was on my way to get some food, walking to a local restaurant when a 32 year old man I did not know stopped me and started telling me how beautiful I was, and oddly enough, started showing me the scars on his knee before asking me if I could go out for drinks with him. 

2) funnily enough on the same street, a homeless man asked me for some money to buy food. I had a bit of change in my purse so I went to grab him some, just to help out someone in need. He started asking me if I was still in school, and I freaked out, and impulsively told him I am an adult… to which he immediately asked “oh are you single?” When I didn’t respond he kept on pressing. I told him I did not want to be hit on, but he kept asking until I gave him the change (mostly now out of fear of repercussions if I didn’t.) and dipped.

Both of these instances were in broad daylight and in public, otherwise I wouldn’t have even walked on the same street as them. 

The third example happened while I was at work. I work as a cashier and was just getting a customers items checked out. When I finished he started telling me how “cute” and “polite” I was, before asking me out for coffee. I shouldn’t have said it, but I snapped out of customer service mode and asked “how old are you?” He was 35. 

I’m just angry, because I’ve always been the target of older men’s ‘attentions’ ever since I was very little. I have PTSD because of it, and idk if maybe they can sniff it out somehow? I’m aware of the naïveté that comes with youth, and I’m aware that some older guys will go for young women because they’re more easy to manipulate. If it were just one guy that did that to me I would dismiss it as just that and laugh, but it seems to be an ever growing pattern and I absolutely hate it. 

I don’t know if there’s a way I can avoid this or not, but if anyone has any ideas please please do comment them",1,1764590866.0,SexualHarassmentTalk,0,1.0,False
1pbb2q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pbb2q4/aita_for_letting_my_tutors_son_eat_too_little/,AITA for letting my tutor’s son eat too little?,"My(19) tutor taught me English from the age of 12 to 17. She’s the reason I managed to pass the English part of my university entrance exam. We still keep in touch.

Last week, her son(16)’s leg was badly injured in an accident. Yesterday, she asked me if I could visit him with some dinner since she couldn’t cancel classes. I bought pork fried rice with a banana as a snack and iced latte. The guy often told me coffee actually makes him sleepy and that he prefers drinking it later in the day.

He ate the entire banana and drank the coffee but only had a little bit of the fried rice. He said he’s too worried about his future footballing prospects to eat more(he’s currently a striker for his school’s team). I tried to tell him that he will be fine and eating more could help him recover sooner but he snapped at me. Told me I’m ‘a bookworm like [his] mom’ and ‘couldn’t understand’ what this sort of accident means to an athlete.

So I didn’t press the issue. His mom called me and we talked. She was upset I didn’t get him to eat more, saying that I’ve always been a bit of an older brother figure to him and he would have listened if I insisted.

Imagine wandering the medieval streets of Barcelona after a late night at a sailor's bar in 1900. You stumble in to one of the few places still open at that time of night; Els Quatre Gats. You were hoping to see Santiago Rusiñol, Miguel Utrillo, or Ramon Casa i Carbó debating the state of art. In the back, a young artist named Pablo Picasso is having his first one-man show. ""Els Quatre Gats"" is Catalan slang for ""just a few people."" Very true tonight as you decide what snack to pair with your coffee.

1pbaymf,https://www.idsnews.com/article/2025/11/bloomington-starbucks-workers-strike,"‘No Contract, No Coffee’: Bloomington Starbucks workers join national strike","The Starbucks on Indiana Avenue closed for most of the day Friday as workers joined a nationwide strike protesting the lack of contract and wage negotiations between Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol and labor union Starbucks Workers United.  

Barista and union member Eliza Ortiz said the group of employees decided to protest Friday after waiting for the first wave of strikes across the nation to see if there would be any reaction or negotiations for a new contract guaranteeing better treatment.  

“If they wanted to come back to the bargaining table, then our strike would have ended,” Ortiz said. “But obviously they haven't. So, we are escalating.” 

Starbucks Workers United began in 2021 and now includes over 11,000 baristas in 550 stores across the nation, according to its website. The Indiana Avenue store joined 120 other stores escalating the strike Friday, which began with a nationwide walkout Nov. 13 during Starbucks’ seasonal “Red Cup Day.” 

Bloomington’s other unionized Starbucks store located on State Road 46 did not participate in the strike, barista Annabelle Purkey said. Purkey said the store’s union leader has been out recovering from surgery. According to text messages reviewed by the Indiana Daily Student, employees of at least one Starbucks in Bloomington were offered overtime to pick up shifts at the Indiana Avenue location. 

According to the Starbucks Workers United website, national framework bargaining, which sets the basic guidelines for future negotiations, began in April 2024. Employees grew frustrated after a September 2024 set of economic proposals to negotiate pay was rejected in December 2024 by Starbucks, which responded with its own economic plan. The union calls this plan unserious because it didn't raise wages in the first year of the contract or address the main issues of the union’s proposal. 

After the rejection, the union said talks broke down, and Starbucks backtracked on previously agreed-upon paths forward, causing the union to file a national unfair labor practice charge saying, “Starbucks had failed to bargain in good faith and was undermining the representative status of the union.”  

Since the proposals were rejected in December, the union has said Starbucks has failed to negotiate a fair contract. 

A group of about seven picketers arrived at Starbucks on Indiana Avenue at 8 a.m. Friday, equipped with signs reading “No Contract, No Coffee” and “Baristas on Strike!”. Ortiz chanted through a bullhorn at passing cars, urging them to support their cause. Members of the Bloomington chapter of Democratic Socialists of America joined the protest after urging people on Instagram to sign a pledge calling on Niccol to bargain a fair contract. 

Ortiz, who helped organize the protest, said picketers arrived shortly after the managers opened the store. She said the managers closed the store about four hours after opening when employees didn’t show up for work, and after picketers gathered on the sidewalk, the managers ushered customers out of the restaurant.  

A sign was posted on the door reading, “Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience. We are working to re-open our store as quickly as possible.” The sign provided a link to find other Starbucks locations but didn’t explain the reason for closing. 

In a statement provided to The National Law review, Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said the initial strikes on Nov. 13 affected less than 1% of stores. Anderson said Starbucks is tracking to exceed sale expectations for the 13th, which was Reusable Red Cup Day, a promotion that offered customers who ordered holiday drinks a limited-edition cup. 

“The facts show people like working at Starbucks,” Anderson said, “Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year. Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners.”  

In June 2024, the Indiana Avenue Store filed a petition to unionize after communicating with union representatives from other stores in late 2023 due to inconsistencies with scheduling and a push for a higher wage. 

“People weren't getting enough hours, our hours were getting cut all the time, and our shifts weren't consistent,” Ortiz said. 

“I’m still struggling to pay rent and get my medications and get groceries,” she added. 

Ortiz said after a few employees became tired of what she said was “mistreatment” by Starbucks, they joined together in early November and began following what was happening with Starbucks Workers United. 

After Ortiz said she didn’t hear anything from the Indiana Avenue management in response to the strikes or in pursuit of negotiations for better pay and dealing with staffing issues, she and a few other Starbucks employees decided to explore their options.    

“We reached out to Workers United to see what we could do,” Ortiz said. “Once we got word from them, we started talking to our co-workers about it in person, one-on-ones. Doing that, we got support for it.” 

After speaking with Starbucks Workers United about organizing a strike and passing information to co-workers at her local store, Ortiz and a few others got together Thanksgiving night to work on signs and flyers.  

They printed out sing-along style chants like “What’s disgusting? Union Busting” and “My neck! My back! My paycheck is whack!” 

Even before Friday morning, Ortiz was already sure the strike would make an impact. Ortiz said the group plans to picket every day until changes are made, while the Bloomington chapter of DSA also said it would be joining them every day from 8 a.m. to noon. 

“I am 100% certain people will not be going to work (Friday), and I'm quite certain that the store will be closed,” Ortiz said. “I don't know how long that will last, but our goal is for our store to be closed as long as we strike.""",24,1764590442.0,union,0,1.0,False

**Author’s Note #1:**  
Interlude 3 is still ongoing, I’m just skipping to S04E01 for now because there’s more than enough material.

This opening chapter of Season 4, or as I privately call it, “The Luca mini-arc”, was already being written piecemeal while writing Season 3. The story below was supposed to be part of that season, but it already had been running for over twenty chapters and needed to end. As a result, I re-routed the plot to give The Whales a reason to turn back and try again after dealing with so many encounters.

Season 04, Chapter 01B

# Out Of The Frying Pan And Into The Fire (Part 2)

\_\_\_

**Downtown Chicago, Another Earth:**

The fight was over in barely five minutes. 

The last possum has dropped dead, the big giant fish was already helping itself on one of them. Luke jumped in surprise as a big pumpkin straight out of the Little Shop of Horrors wiggle past him to join the fish, croaking in excitement as its rapidly shifting roots propelled it along the ground.

One possum was sent flying, landing behind the mice's ranks. The big mutant was still moving despite the loud crunching of bones. Luke scrambled backwards though the blond was unmoved.

Suddenly, the song ""Pomp and Circumstance"" started playing loud from the direction of the trucks as the super-girl leapt high into view, clearing easily five stories; he could tell how high because she had leapt onto a nearby skyscraper, before jumping down and dealing a fatal elbow drop right into the possum's skull.

""Your winner and **STILL! UNDISPUTED! COOKIEWEIGHT! CHAMPYAAAAAAN AAAV THE WUUUUUURLD!**"" a squeaky voice yelled over the speaker. The super-girl sprung back to her feet, doing the Macho Man twirl with both pointer fingers pointing out. The mice squeaked triumphantly and shot bursts of gunfire into the air.

""Clean up time!"" she said. ""Everyone stay on guard.""

""Before you ask anything."" the blond said coldly ""We're here because some of your eggheads opened up a portal. Some of us are expats who don't appreciate it. We're taking your nukes, and we're blowing this place up. After we're done, I suggest you drive as far away from Chicago as possible.""

""I...see..."" Luke said.

“*Or you can come with us…*” A boy’s voice said over the radio, “*This place looks trashed to hell and even if they cleaned up here, there’s nothing fun till the next decade, buddy.*”

“I…” Luke said, taken aback. It sounded too good to be true, and these weirdos with their pet monsters were starting to give him some sketchy cult vibes.

""No we're not calling the police to help,” She-Ra said, she didn’t seem to mind as Luke snatched his wandering eyes off of her, “... we're not calling the army, and we're not going out of our way to save anyone. I've witnessed disasters before, I've seen two buildings in Manhattan...two buildings! And that place got swarmed with rescuers and police. This place is abandoned by your government and we're not taking up their slack. After you help us, you just focus on getting out of Dodge. Or take up Baseplate’s offer to come with us. Trust me, he’s right. You can watch re-runs of Dawson’s Creek at our place anyway, all without a single commercial.""

“*And without paying a single penny to keep them off*.” The boy, presumably the “Baseplate” character that She-Ra mentioned, quipped.

The dragon, which was stalking around the carcasses, turned its head to face the She-Ra girl.

“Dawson’s Creek wouldn’t air until 1998…”

“My bad…”

""O-okay..."" Luke watched as the cat-wizard started using telekinesis to start hauling the giant carcasses of possums, there were a whole lot of them. So much after she was done she had effectively barricaded the street.

""What's your name?"" The super-girl asked, heading over to the blondie.

""It's Luke, Luke Meyer, junior..."" he said, standing up hesitantly. ""Luca actually, it's just easier for most people to call me Luke.""

""Luca it is."" The blond made a dismissive slice of her hand in the air. “We’re not dumbing down names here.”

""Ingrid."" Super-girl replied. ""Mind telling me what's going on here?""

""To be honest..."" Luca stammered ""I really don't know... things just suddenly got crazy around two weeks ago, we got giant raccoons biting people and then there's like zombies that look like Alf if he went to Chernobyl...""

“He said Alf!” squeaked a voice “We're definitely back in the 90's!”

""What's the date?"" Ingrid inquired.

""September 15th"" Luca said, ""why?""

“Oof!” said the squeaky voice, it seemed to be coming from the gunship-like portal hovering above them, “Four days too close.”

“Too close to what?” Luca asked.

""Too soon."" Ingrid replied, turning to the direction of the squeaky voice, before looking back at him, she too seemed indifferent to his stares. ""Luca, you know a good K-mart around here? We're scavenging for supplies, it's the least your world can give us.""

""Umm... sure...but who are you people?"" Luca said, not knowing where to look.

Ingrid looked indifferent ""Task-Force One-""

""Oh shut it!"" the squeaky voice said, cutting Ingrid off, one of the portals had floated down, revealing the source of the voice to be an adorable blue blob sitting on a little throne in some fancy castle, a smaller blob sat in front of it, manning a bipod-mounted machine gun Rambo would use with little tendrils, the little blob stood off to the side, keeping the gun pointed away from him. Cecil himself held a Russian AK, although it looked all wrong. It looked like someone had dressed it in a fancy fantasy aesthetic with all its golden engravings and exotic material. He was sure any gun nut would find the prospect of actually firing the gun constituted a grave crime. 

A trio of armed mice stood by him, with the third perched atop a coffee table. They squeaked and chirped happily as they waved in greeting although the third mouse on the table quickly resumed his vigil; squinting down a marksman’s rifle for any further threats.

""We're the Whales, you chose that name Ingrid, we're sticking with it."" Cecil snapped at Ingrid, before turning his attention to Luca.""Cecil by the way, you ever played Dungeons and Dragons, Luca?”

“I do, on weekends…with my…” Luca sighed “my friends…”

Cecil’s portal hovered over and he patted his shoulder with a jiggly tendril. To his surprise and relief, Cecil felt dry and solid, albeit a little cold, and didn’t leave any residue on his clothes, which could do with a wash anyway. 

“My condolences…”

Luca shook his head “I’m sure they’re fine…mostly, I’d like to think most of them have run back home at Lakeview where…” he paused again “Where the CDC or whoever took them someplace hopefully safer than this…”

“Right.” Cecil said, “We’re adventurers, just like in DnD. You could say we’re hired muscle too, anything that needs the big guns-.”

“Or in this case, glorified animal and pest control.” Philia chuckled, causing Ingrid and Cecil to join her in mirth.

“We were running a dungeon and a nasty little portal opened up,” Ingrid continued for Cecil, “, that wormhole connected our worlds together and we’re here to shut it down.”

“I see…”

""Now, ever saw any military checkpoints?"" Cecil pressed.

""Yeah I do..."" Luca said, ""they're around...""

""Fill in Cecil while I hotwire a car for you."" Ingrid said. She tried out a white Toyota Corolla, but it was locked. She called one of the mice who scurried over and produced a lockpick. As Luke gave directions he watched as the oversized mouse undo the lock in a few seconds. Ingrid then climbed in and got to work.

""Enjoy the view, Luca."" The blonde winked at him. 

""\[What's she doing?\]"" The amazon asked, looking on curiously. Luca gulped as he got a better look at her, she was rather tall and imposing, and whatever she was radiating was even more distinct now. 

Just like Ingrid, the amazon really felt like he was standing right next to a tank.

""She's an orc, by the way."" The blue blob said, noticing his lovestruck gaze.

""What, you mean like those Tolkien ones?""

""Our orcs are different, if we had modern vehicles she'd be a real bad-ass biker babe."" Cecil snickered.

""Definitely looks the part."" Luca muttered. She noticed him looking at her and she flashed an approving grin.

“\[You’re cute!\]” the amazon said, ruffling his hair. “Sammy, Sammy Foster.”

“I’m Luca Meyer….junior” Luca said, Sammy grinned wide.

“Junior means he inherited his father's name as well.” Cecil explained “They only start using the numbers from the third generation, like England’s Charles III”

“\[I like that name…Sounds like a good rider\].” Sammy said.

“Sorry, I’m not that good…” Luca said sheepishly, “I ditched my car when it ran out of fuel…”

“\[It served you well…\]” for some reason Sammy had a sad look on her face.

“Our orcs are riders by nature.” Philia said “So having to ditch your car is like having to put down a horse that’s gone lame to her.”

“Also, our Earth names sound very orcish and familiar.” Cecil explained.

""You need a special key to activate this vehicle."" Ingrid replied to Sammy as the Toyota coughed into life and the engine started purring. ""I bypassed the need for the key.""

""Excuse me..."" Luca asked ""How are you communicating with each other? Aside from you, Cecil, and-""

""Philiia."" The blond said.

“I speak English too.” The red dragon said, it was walking over the bodies and joining the lizard girl in delivering the coupe de grace on the still-moving possums. It stabbed its narrow leg into a weakly moving possum’s skull and it went out like a light.

“And me,” Said another robotic voice.

""Right.” Luca remarked, “...while the rest seem to be speaking elvish or something.""

""Interpretation magic."" Philia replied quickly ""Saves you mmmillllions of dollars...""

Somehow it caused Ingrid and Cecil to snort in laughter.

""...in not having to attend language classes,” Philia said, her accent changing as she spoke quickly “because I tell you what, I know this guy, Minister Drak de Vries, he's a nice guy you know, but he's a little kooky sometimes, like he thought it would be a good idea to save on mana and just have people learn it straight.” she shook her head “It's disgraceful... Why do mmmmillions of good, honest, hard-working people... have to waste so much money to learn these things when we're already communicating just fine? What every kingdom needs is for everyone to have good, stable-""

""JEEEEERBS!"" the slime drawled, causing both Ingrid and Philia to chuckle. ""Alright miss President, bring it home now, don't wanna get an earful out here in Chicago.""

That caused Ingrid and Philia to chuckle.

""\[What's the plan now, Ingrid?\]"" The wolf-girl said, skewering a possum that was still breathing. Her long fork-like weapon easily slid into the back of its neck and the creature was put out of its misery.

""Same as usual, we resupply at a K-Mart, then we grab the nukes."" Ingrid said ""We'll take Luca along since he knows the way, we don't have Chicago anymore where I'm from.""

""Where are you from?"" Luke asked. ""And what do you mean you don't have Chicago anymore?""

“You should ask *when* we’re from.” Philia remarked.

""We're from the future, Marty!"" Ingrid said in her best Doc Brown impression. ""We lost Illinois to aliens after we nuked the hell out of it. That said, this Earth's history is all wrong. So we're no help to you in figuring out the Power Ball numbers for next week.""

“Assuming there still is a power ball.” Cecil quipped.

""This is a lot to take in..."" Luca said, his brain feeling like it was about to burst.

""Some of us here are from an Earth with a different history and a couple of decades ahead."" Ingrid began. ""We died protecting our home and we ended up resurrected in Dungeons and Dragons land. Now..."" Ingrid rolled her shoulders to loosen up. ""Someone on this Earth decided it was a funny idea to open a portal leading to our DnD land. We're here to close it. And as compensation, we're going to take some of your weapons of mass destruction. The chances are good that you have a black site somewhere here.""

""How do you know that?"" Luca asked.

“At least in our timeline, the nukes Ingrid mentioned earlier were all stored here in Chicago.” Cecil said. “Originally built to keep out the Russians if they took Alaska and came in through Canada. It's also why the quarantine area is ridiculously large. Just in case those nukes go off.""

""Well that's a bummer."" Luke sighed ""Ever think about settling back here?""

""Nah."" Ingrid shrugged. ""I have family back in DnD Land. Besides, I got internet... give it a few years and you'll get it.""

“You heard of the ARPANET the US Army was using to pull up intel no matter what they are?” the red dragon asked, putting a bullet through another possum that sprang up to him. It crumpled with a precise shot to the head.

Luca frowned, “Yeah… I heard something about that.”

“Civilians took it over and we use it to watch porn.” Ingrid said matter-of-factly.

“Ohh kaaaay…” Luca blushed, he had never expected a girl to say something like that.

""Start mining for bitcoin as soon as it becomes a thing."" Philia added cryptically.

""Don't open any suspicious e-mails, even if it says 'I Love You'."" Cecil squeaked.

""If anyone asks you to go to buy a prepaid gift card for them, just ignore it."" The other robotic voice said.

""Okay..."" Luca said, utterly lost.

""I'll write it down for you later."" Cecil said.

""Alright,"" Luca asked, ""what's going on now? Sounds like you're taking back those monsters.""

""Gotta make a buck."" Philia replied.

""We have establishments back home that convert these carcasses into useful products.” The dragon explained. Luca could now see it was shooting a BB gun into another possum’s head, but at a much higher force, “They'll pay us good gold for exotic creatures like these. We also don’t have giant possums where we’re from.""

""\[Item Boxing...\]"" the cat wizard announced.

A loud crack reverberated through the air. Luca whipped his head back to the direction of the trucks and saw that the elf sorceress had her staff pointing at something. Complex holographic circles manifested from the end of her staff. Meanwhile, her retinue of mice started squeaking excitedly as they leapt off the truck and towards whatever it was she had zapped.

“Trouble, Siria?” Philia asked, but the elf shook her head.

“\[Just wormheads.\]” The elf, Siria, replied, “\[The mice are bringing them back now.\]”

""Everyone, eyes sharp!"" Ingrid said, reverting to her commander mode. ""Neith get a bird's eye view.""

""Standby..."" The robotic voice said. Meanwhile Ingrid had turned into a black-and-crimson blur as she leapt towards the area that Siria had fried with her spell. Soon, wormhead bodies started flying into the air, their bodies like ragdolls as they crashed into the possum carcasses.

Luca then finally realized that the robot spider was the other mechanical voice. From the spider’s body, a small flying machine shot off to the sky.

""Programmed her myself."" Philia said, noticing him look at the spider-bot, which hadn't moved an inch since it drew to a halt at the back of the convoy, ""A real HAL9000 menace that Neith is.""

""Don't be fooled by her."" Neith snapped, ""She built me originally just to organize her porn folder.""

""A what?"" Luca's jaw dropped.

“*Philia has a petabyte worth of porn in her computer*.” Ingrid laughed, her voice coming from the walkie-talkie.

“That’s admissible in Azavian courts.” The dragon said with a tone of amusement. Luca blinked as he noticed that the dragon didn’t have that mechanical effect to its voice.

""Also."" The other robot said flatly. ""She has a bad habit of labelling things incorrectly. Too many duplicates.""

“That’s a crime in my court.” The dragon quipped, chuckling. It sounded so natural.

Luca’s brain was swimming now.

“A petabyte is worth about seven-hundred-forty-five million floppy disks of data.” The dragon explained. 

“Y’all need Jesus!” Cecil chortled.

""Great minds are a mess."" Philia said, turning around to assume watch over the trucks. 

“And you would be? The red dragon, sir…” Luca asked.

“Bronson.” The red dragon bot said. “They love joking about my status as a former cop. I’m not from Earth by the way, I’m Azavian. An alien artificial intelligence in other words.”

“You mean like another HAL like Neith is?” 

“Yup, My original name’s just some Azavi letters and numbers and Philia insisted I pick a new name; a real one. I was going to pick Charles Bronson, but one of our mice had already been assigned as Charles, so Bronson it is.”

“Cool!” Luca chuckled as he digested the information, “He’s my favorite actor… so uhhh… you’re like Robocop or something?”

“Yup.” Bronson replied, despite being a robot, Luca found his mannerisms quite lively, he wouldn’t have been surprised if Bronson shed his armor and turned out to be a well-spoken alien giraffe. “Despite my designation, I’m not just an anti-riot bot, but an actual police officer-”

Neith made a genuine coughing sound.

“Budget cuts…”

“That’s only half the story, but yeah.” Bronson said “I and other units like myself were given all the due authority and responsibilities as uniformed officers. I patrolled streets, issued traffic tickets and looked out for kids playing hooky. You’re not playing hooky, are you? Nah, I’m kidding.”

“Anti-riot bot?” Luke parroted, “You mean like those apartheid demonstrations?” 

Bronson’s many lights flashed red as he sighed and hung his head, chuckling to himself.

“Oof…” Bronson laughed, Luke was surprised to see the red dragon actually shake in laughter, “The first words of someone from Earth in 1990, and two years before Rodney King…”

“Pssh…” Cecil waved a jiggly tendril dismissively “*Fuck the Police* by NWA was released a year ago. Look at him, he’s wearing his Airness’ shoes too.”

“I play baseball actually…” Luca said.

""Focus guys!” Philia said, “We have to move soon, Luca, make yourself useful and watch the rear with me.""

""Or you could watch her rear."" Neith interjected. ""She needs an outsider to appraise her cardio.""

""That works too."" Philia said, not bothering to turn around.

""Maybe I could ask for your number.""

Philia grabbed his hand and simply placed it on her breast. 

“We cut out the middle-man where we’re from, Luca.” Philia smiled, “Now squeeze.”

“Ummm…” Luca murmured, it was soft and springy. “Th-thanks?”

The fluffy sheep wizard turned out to be a cleric, Luca turned his head to the sound of clinking and fragrant incense billowed from her staff-mounted thurible. 

“Mating rights accepted.” The sheep said solemnly.

Luca gulped.

“*Out of the frying pan and into the fire…*” He thought.

the four of us hang out regularly. like dinner at each other's houses, game nights, that kind of thing



i'm fine with that. i like tyler. he's a good guy. the group hangouts are fun



the problem is melissa keeps trying to force a separate friendship between us



she's always suggesting girls trips. girls nights. coffee dates. spa days. just the two of us



i've politely declined like 3 times now. i'm just. not interested



we don't have that much in common. she's really into fitness and lifestyle blogging. i work at a bank as a loan officer and in my free time i mostly read and play video games



we're friendly at group hangouts. we chat. it's fine. but i don't want to hang out one on one



last week melissa texted me asking if i wanted to do a weekend trip to milwaukee. just us girls



i said thanks but i don't think i can make that work



she called me. actually called. and said she's noticed i keep turning down her invitations and she's feeling rejected



i tried to be nice about it. i said i'm just not really a girls trip person and that i have a lot going on



she said it seems like i'm being standoffish and that i'm ruining the ""couple friendship""



i said we can still do couple things i just don't want to do separate one on one hangouts



she got quiet and said ""so you don't want to be my friend""



i said it's not that i don't want to be friends it's that i don't think we need to force a separate friendship outside of the group



she told tyler. tyler told josh. now josh thinks i should make more effort for his best friend's sake



i said i AM making effort. i'm friendly at group events. i just don't want forced girls trips with someone i don't have much in common with



josh says melissa's feelings are hurt and that i should just go on ONE trip to smooth things over



i said no. i don't want to go on a trip with melissa. that's my boundary



now melissa's being weird at group hangouts. like overly polite and distant. tyler's weird too



josh is annoyed with me and says i'm being difficult



aitj for not wanting to be forced into a friendship?

Our relationship has been going on for 1 year and 2 months and is extremely unstable, with no real commitment. I used to think I had a chance that he would choose me, but unfortunately, he never did.

Last month, we had a big fight and I decided to leave the relationship. However, he came back apologizing and showed some effort to commit. I believed him, as I usually do, and things went well for a while.

Yesterday, he told me he was going to meet two guys — one he “dates” and another “hookup.” I told him it was fine, but we had agreed he would grab coffee with me and explain something. He said he could do it then, but it was 10 a.m. and I had just woken up, so I said it wasn’t a good time. I reminded him he had committed to me and needed to prioritize me, and he agreed.

Two hours later, I received 30 angry messages from him, accusing me of questioning his commitment. He was creating drama to avoid keeping his promise. When I tried to call him, he exploded, told me not to call, said it wasn’t my time, and hung up. At that moment, I thought the only solution was to leave this toxic relationship. I told him everything on my mind and blocked him from all platforms.

About an hour later, I received messages from him on iMessage — apologizing. I ignored them. He also sent a voice note crying, and because I love him, I responded and talked to him. Later, I realized he mostly reached out to cancel the coffee with the other guy because he felt lonely. I spent the whole night talking to him and making him feel better.

At the end of the call, I told him I was going to grab coffee with another man for three days, trying to be honest and not hide anything. He said that if I went, he wouldn’t make any effort for our relationship. I canceled my plans for him, knowing it was probably a mistake.

This morning, I sent him a clear message:

“First, yesterday you asked me to stick to your rules, and that if I went to see John, you would give up on the relationship because you wanted more. At first, I was upset and there was a small misunderstanding, but then I agreed and told you I cancelled. I expect you to do the same with anyone else.”

I was very clear and just wanted a simple answer, but he ignored the question and talked about other topics.

I feel like I’m stuck in a game with him and constantly manipulated.

Questions: •	Did I say something in my message that could upset him? •	How do I handle a gray-area relationship like this without being manipulated? •	Has anyone experienced something similar with an older partner?

TL;DR: I’m 22, in a gray-area relationship with a 63-year-old man. He avoids answering my questions, manipulates situations, and I feel trapped and exhausted. I need advice on how to handle this.",3,1764590101.0,relationships,3,0.8,False
1pbaurm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pbaurm/modulating_sweetness/,Modulating Sweetness,"So I understand that over extraction leads to stuff like astringency (which I associate with overly strong black tea) and bitterness. Under extracted coffee is maybe acidic and weak. Correct me if I’m wrong above, but assuming this is the case, where in this scale does perceived “sweetness” lie? I’m trying a carbonic macerated decaf. I’m able to tell it’s sort of sweet. I can smell some cool stuff, but I feel it may be slightly astringent. I’m worried that lowering extraction by reducing the temperature or agitation might make it lose its flavor, and it already isn’t a punching me in the face type flavor.

I guess my question would be, if I’m changing up agitation and temp to figure out if my coffee is over or under extracted, what can I do to prevent losing the sweetness or juice feeling?

1pbatwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1pbatwa/from_bose_qc_straight_to_meze_silva/,From Bose QC straight to Meze Silva?,"Hey everyone,  
A while ago, I moved my speakers from the home office to the living room because the lack of distance to the walls and also myself the speakers couldn’t really get the best sound out of them. So for now, I’m relying on my Bose QuietComfort headphones, which is totally fine.

The thing is, I often end up buying pretty high-end, expensive gear—even though I’d probably be better off with something mid-range. Based on a recommendation from an online music store (Thomann), I’ve now ordered the Meze 105 Silva, AER, Sennheiser 550HD, and HifiMan Ananda to give them a try. So from 200-500€ Range.

I wear glasses, which makes choosing headphones a bit tricky because they can press against the frame. Interestingly, clamping force doesn’t seem to be the main issue—the softness of the ear pads matters much more? For example, my Bose headphones actually have a stronger clamping force, but their pads are softer and more comfortable than the models I just ordered.

I’m still completely new to this world, but so far, I found the Meze Silva to be the most comfortable. The sound is really good—I had to listen for quite a while to start noticing the differences between the headphones. Honestly though, I can barely tell them apart. To the Bose I can, but they recording has a big effect also!

**So here’s my question: Are there other headphones that are just as comfortable and good as the Silva in terms of sound?** I know the price comes from sound and the quality of the parts.  
**Or is that impossible to say because everyone has different head shapes, ear sizes, and so on? Coming back to my explaination on top: I appreciate the worthyness(?) of the Silva. No plastic shit, it feels solid!**

**To sum it up: I find it crazy that I’m seriously considering buying the Silva, even though many people rave about the HiFiMan Ananda or XS as being amazing—while I’d be paying almost twice as much for the Silva as a complete beginner. All I want is one pair of headphones for hours of music listening.**

**If I think long-term, these headphones will probably last 10 years or more. That’s like €40 per year, and considering how many hours I’ll spend enjoying music every day, the price feels ridiculously cheap. But Sennheiser will also last as long, so that shouldnt matter. Its about comfort AND sound.** 

This post probably doesn’t make much sense—I guess I just want to hear from you: Are there any other great alternatives to the Silva that are equally comfortable but more affordable? Or should I just say, “Screw it, I can afford it, buy the Silva, and stop looking at headphones for the next decade”?

There a so many parallels to other aspects of life like Coffee or Whiskey. Music is still music, with Bose QC or Silva, but Silva is more detailed. Expensive Coffee or Whiskey has more depth and nuances as well. It's everyones decision what price they are ready to pay and what they expect of this experience.

I know Reddit can be a real rabbit hole for stuff like this. In that sub, a lot of people even own multiple headphones (what, why???), probably because they use them for different genres or something. It kind of feels like I’m supposed to first buy another open-back headphone for around €200 before “earning” the upgrade to the Silva—even though it would obviously be cheaper to just go straight for the Silva.

i stay over at brandon's place pretty regularly. maybe 3 or 4 nights a week? sometimes more if we both have time off



it's never been a problem. or i thought it wasn't a problem



about a month ago i started noticing these passive aggressive comments from corey



like i'd be making coffee in the morning and he'd be like ""must be nice to have a third roommate who doesn't pay rent""



or i'd leave my shampoo in the shower and he'd move it to the counter with a note that said ""guest items""



i tried to ignore it at first but it kept happening



last week i was there and corey left a note on the bathroom mirror. it said ""reminder: this is a two-person apartment, please be mindful of shared spaces""



i was so annoyed. i confronted him and said if you have a problem with me being here you should talk to brandon not leave passive aggressive notes



he said he HAS talked to brandon and brandon doesn't care. and that i'm being defensive



i said yeah i'm defensive because you're being rude instead of having an actual conversation



brandon thinks i should've just ignored the note. that corey's ""going through stuff"" and i'm making it worse



but like. i'm not the one leaving notes. i'm not the one making snide comments



so i've been staying over MORE now. like 5 or 6 nights a week. partially because brandon and i want to spend time together but also. kind of out of spite



corey's been even more passive aggressive. moving my stuff. sighing loudly when i'm in the kitchen. making comments about the water bill



brandon says i'm making things worse and i should just stay at my place more often to keep the peace



i said why should i be the one to change my behavior when corey's the one with the problem



my best friend thinks i'm being petty. brandon's annoyed with me. corey's annoyed with me



but i don't think i'm wrong? like if corey has an issue he should use his words like an adult

Hi everyone, I’m a 20-year-old female and have been training boxing or kickboxing 4-5 times a week for about a year now. When I started, I weighed around 154 pounds (70 kg), but after a year, my weight increased to about 174 pounds (79 kg). I’m not sure why this happened. I get that some weight gain could be from muscle, but I used to go to a regular gym before and didn’t see this kind of increase. Plus, I don’t really notice much difference in muscle size visually.
A year ago, I ate about 1500-1800 calories daily and felt fine. Now I eat around 2000-2100 calories per day, usually spread over 1-2 meals. I do feel stronger and healthier than ever, but my belly has become round and feels bigger than before . I just look bigger overall in some clothes and don’t like my look in the swimsuit .
My diet is high in protein and I enjoy donairs regularly (although I know they’re not always the healthiest choice but have lots of meat). I also drink coffee daily that adds about 200-300 calories, and sometimes I eat sweets.
I’ve tried strict calorie counting and keto diets before with no weight loss results. What could I be doing wrong? How can I flatten my stomach and lose this belly fat? Would really appreciate any advice or insights!",1,1764589670.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,0.67,False

1pbap6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneStopCentre/comments/1pbap6g/the_simple_template_trick_that_makes_an_airbnb/,The simple “Template” trick that makes an Airbnb feel custom without extra work,"One thing I’ve noticed with good Airbnbs and real estate experiences:

they feel personal, but behind the scenes they’re running on systems.

The easiest system most hosts skip?
Templates.

Not AI, not fancy apps, just a small set of reusable documents you tweak for each guest.

Examples that actually work in real life:

•Welcome handbook template – Same layout every time, but you change the name on the cover:
“Welcome, Sarah & James 👋” instead of “House Manual”.

Inside: Wi-Fi, house rules, check-out steps, local tips, all in the same place.


•Message templates – Saved replies for:
booking confirmed, pre-arrival info, check-in instructions, mid-stay check (“Everything ok so far?”), and check-out reminder.

You just drop in dates and names instead of re-typing every time.


•Cleaning / reset checklist – One page that lists exactly what needs to be reset between guests:
beds, towels, supplies, photos to check so the place always matches your listing.


•Mini “area guide” template – Same sections every time: coffee, groceries, walks, late-night food, rainy-day ideas. Swap in the actual places that fit each property.


Once you build these once, you’re not starting from a blank page again:


•Guests feel like you’ve put in extra effort (their name in the handbook, clear instructions, local tips).


•You make fewer mistakes because you’re following the same layout every time.


•It’s easier to hand over to a co-host or cleaner because the process is written down.


Curious how other hosts/agents do this:

•What’s one template (document, checklist, message) that saves you the most time with guests or clients?

•And if you don’t use templates yet, where do you feel the most friction right now — guest messages, cleaning, or explaining the property?

Would love to see what others have built or hacked together.?",1,1764589573.0,OneStopCentre,0,1.0,False

I’m based in Electronic City (Phase 1) and we’re a small group of 5 techies who’ve been feeling the classic *WFH -> office -> sleep -> repeat* loop 😅  
So we thought.. why not break the monotony and actually get to know more people around us?

We’re planning to start a casual meetup every Friday in / around Electronic City Phase 1.  
Not a party, not a dating scene, not a business pitch, just a simple “let’s talk, make new friends and expand our network” kind of thing.

✔ open to anyone (doesn’t matter where you work or what you do)  
✔ super casual... just conversations, chai/coffee, and new connections  
✔ zero agenda, zero pressure... join when you feel like it

If this sounds interesting, drop a comment or DM, and we’ll ping you the details to join whenever you want.

It would be fun to build a small community of like-minded folks in E-City instead of just sitting through weekends in boredom 😄",2,1764589485.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False

It is first come first serve but with an energy that feels like we are reenacting some kind of corporate Hunger Games every morning.

Anyway we have this one chair. The Fancy Chair. The only chair in the entire building that does not squeak, tilt to one side, or feel like it was designed by a medieval torturer. Everyone wants it. Nobody admits that they want it. Management insists that all chairs are equal which is a lie so bold it should be printed on a flag.

One Monday I walk in early because my cat woke me up by throwing up on my pillow. I beat everyone else in and I claim The Fancy Chair. It is mine. I settle in, sip my coffee, open my laptop, feel the lumbar support cradle my soul. Bliss.

Then at exactly nine oh two, Todd from accounting comes in. Todd is the guy who microwaves fish and brings up crypto at every possible opportunity. He sees me in the chair. His eyes widen like I have just stolen his birthright.

He goes, Oh wow someone got here early.

I go, Yup.

He goes, Do you really need that chair?

And I swear on my cat he lurks behind me all day. Not even subtly. He just keeps wandering by and sighing. Loudly. Like I kicked his childhood dog.

The next morning I come in at the same time. The Fancy Chair is gone. Vanished. Not in the office. Not in the meeting rooms. Not even in the storage closet where everything else goes to die. People are whispering like a crime has occurred. Someone claims they saw Todd wheeling it toward the elevator.

We never saw the chair again. Management sent an email reminding us that all chairs are office property and must remain on our floor. Todd claimed ignorance with the enthusiasm of a toddler covered in cookie crumbs insisting he has no idea where the cookies went.

Now we all sit in squeaky crooked chairs united by mutual suffering. Todd still microwaves fish. The Fancy Chair remains missing. Honestly if it shows up in accounting one day I will not be surprised.",5,1764589339.0,office,8,0.86,False

So a few of us started a *small private circle* , nothing paid, nothing formal , just a group where:

* People share what they’re working on
* Ask questions, exchange ideas, and get real feedback
* Connect with others in the UAE who are actually building things
* And yes, **we do occasional in-person meetups** for coffee and casual discussions

It’s free and completely separate from Reddit. The only goal is to keep things genuine and useful.

1pbaj6b,https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/technical-brief--amazon-footprint-report--en-.pdf,Technical brief: Drivers of Amazon deforestation in agricultural supply chains (PDF),">- Crop commodities, beef production, and – to a
lesser extent – timber plantations are associated
with 8.6 million hectares of deforestation in the
Amazon region between 2018 and 2022. This
accounts for 36% of the total global deforestation
during the same period. Cattle-linked deforestation
is the main direct driver, resulting from pasture
expansion, and accounts for 78% (6.7 million
hectares) of the total commodity-attributed
deforestation in this period. Brazil’s production systems are linked to the vast majority of the
Amazon region footprint, totalling 6.5 million
hectares over this period. More than 20% of the
recent global deforestation footprints of Portugal,
Switzerland, Spain and South Korea originated in
the Amazon region. 59% of the world’s total cattle
deforestation footprint and 33% of the world’s soy
deforestation footprint originated from the
Amazon region.

>- Pasture expansion varies across the Amazon
landscape and is particularly dominant in eastern
and central portions of the Amazon, while also
advancing into the interior. Although cattle
ranching dominates overall, crop expansion is an
important driver in other areas, particularly in
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. A combination of cash
crops (such as soy, oil palm, cocoa, and coffee) and
crops commonly considered staples (such as rice
and sorghum) is associated with this expansion.
The expansion of pasture is part of a complex
process of landuse transition, where it can result
from speculative land clearing or serve as a
mechanism to claim land tenure. Furthermore, the
expansion of soy (and maize) over degraded or
underutilised pasture may be displacing pastures
further, leading to additional forest loss. These
crop-pasture land use dynamics imply that the role
of crop commodities in driving Amazon
deforestation is inevitably under-estimated by
direct land-use change attribution.

>- The majority of the aggregated deforestation
impact appears to be associated with domestic
markets, due to the dominance of pasture
expansion as a direct land use change after
deforestation and with the cattle raised in those
lands primarily consumed domestically. However,
international demand for soy and maize makes up
a greater share of their respective footprints.
The pressure for soy expansion, driving the
displacement of pasture to new fronts of
deforestation, also indicates a more pronounced
influence of international markets on the Amazon
region. Deforestation footprints for commodities
such as maize and oil palm have sharply increased.

>- While the analysis provides unprecedented levels
of regional granularity on the local and remote
drivers of commodity-linked deforestation, data
improvements remain critical to developing even
more powerful insights and for ongoing monitoring
processes. This includes non-forest biomes in
addition to forest systems. Existing gaps in
knowledge about where crops are grown and
where trade flows originate require enhanced
levels of production and supply chain disclosure.
Enhanced data is critical to improve risk
assessments, guide conservation practices towards
areas of current and emerging risk, prevent the
displacement of deforestation activity into
neighbouring and international landscapes and,
more broadly, to promote accountability for
impacts by actors operating within and outside the
Amazon region.",1,1764588990.0,PlantBased4ThePlanet,0,1.0,False

beverly had a sectional sofa delivered. a SECTIONAL. one of those massive L-shaped couches



didn't ask us. didn't measure our living room. just bought it and had it delivered while we were at work



the delivery guys had already unboxed it and set it up. it completely dominated our living room. didn't fit the layout we wanted at all



i was pissed. i called the furniture store and they said if we returned it within 48 hours they'd take it back



so i did. i scheduled a pickup and returned it



when beverly found out she LOST IT. called me ungrateful. said she spent $1200 on that sofa and i ""threw it back in her face""



i said i didn't ask you to buy us a $1200 sofa. we're adults. we can furnish our own home



she started crying and said she's just trying to help us get settled and i'm being cruel

Each year, trillions of coffee beans travel from vibrant farms to high-tech facilities, where industrial precision, roasting expertise, and meticulous quality control transform them into the flavors we rely on every morning.

In this film, I take you inside the full coffee-production journey — from harvesting and sorting to roasting, grinding, and packaging. You’ll see the machinery, craftsmanship, and innovation that ensure every batch stays fresh, aromatic, and ready to brew.

Whether you drink your coffee black, as a latte, or as a creamy cappuccino, this documentary shows the remarkable process that brings your favorite beverage to life.

Hi everyone, need some guidance please. First time ko mag-redeem ng reward (Krispy Kreme eGift) from Microsoft Rewards.

I plan to use the voucher to buy donuts for my sister's birthday on December 14. Should I redeem it na ba?

I have a few questions also:


1. If I redeem it today, valid pa kaya siya sa Dec 14? May ""must use within 24 hours"" rule ba ito or matagal naman expiration?

2. Dumadating ba agad yung code sa email after redeeming? I want to make sure aabot siya before the birthday.

3. May extra steps pa ba like registering on a website, or direct barcode na siya na ipapakita sa cashier?

4. Is this redeemable at all Krispy Kreme branches, or selected ""participating"" stores lang?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1pba07g,https://v.redd.it/ty0e6t1crk4g1,Should I upgrade? [£350],"I've had this Philips 4300 automatic machine for over 3 years now. I have found it very convenient these years but the coffee it makes isn't as good as it once was, the product counter says I've made over 4000 Americanos, almost all of which will have been doubles, it's just me who uses it.

I don't really know much about espresso making or how to tell if a shot is ""good"", I only use medium or dark roast, usually cafe Nero beans, never the ones that have ""fruity"" tasting notes, I have cheap taste in coffee. Anyways I posted the video above if anyone is able to tell me of any red flags or what to look for when the coffee is coming out.

I'm prepared to upgrade, I think the machine is due to retire, I read that the most important part is the grinder, so id probably get a machine and use a separate grinder. I have a time more hand grinder (C3 pro) which came in a pour over kit I got a long time ago, it's sat in the cupboard for years though since I didn't end up liking pour over. I saw Philips have their barista brew espresso machine on sale at the moment for £250, for reference the sage barista express is £450, I'd appreciate some opinions on the barista brew if anyone has any experience with it.

If that machine is good enough for me, I'll get it and use the hand grinder until I can afford a good electric one. I also looked at the Bambino plus which is £360 but I heard the Philips having a 58mm portafilter leaves me more options for accessories, and the tamper it comes with is apparently a lot better than the sage.

I just want something which will make me a double americano in less than 5 mins and not require a huge amount of maintenance or cleaning. The Philips 4300 is already on the edge of too much maintenance, the inside needs cleaning super often and there's too many tiny spots for used grounds to get stuck in.

Will the machine above plus a separate grinder suit me for my 3-5 americanos a day and be just ""good enough""?

  
**TL;DR:** My Philips 4300 super automatic is getting tired after 3+ years and 4000 drinks. I want a simple setup that can make double Americanos quickly with less maintenance. Considering the Philips Barista Brew plus a separate grinder, wondering if it's “good enough” for 3-5 Americanos a day.",0,1764587146.0,espresso,8,0.5,False

I got myself a Rocket Apartamento from eBay and it came with the Rocket Faustino Grinder. I try to reach 25-30 seconds of extraction time with 18,5 grams of coffee. However, it seems like I can’t grind fine enough and every time I reach 37 grams of espresso only 18 seconds are over.

Any recommendations? Do I just use it wrong? I had a Sage Barista Pro for 5 years and it worked more than fine. I thought I’m good to go with an upgrade.

So she's not subjected to only have instant coffee at my place, we bought a moka pot for my kitchen. At the time I had an electric stove and I was kind of expecting I wouldn't have an induction stove until I'd move in with her, so we opted for a non-inductive one.

Then my stove broke amd my landlord decided it was best to just replace the whole thing with an induction stove. That's fairly recent and I haven't gotten around to getting a converter plate yet. The only shop that sells them in my area is closed today. I'd like to surprise my gf with some fancy coffee when she comes over tonight. 

After having looked some things up about how induction stoves, converter plates and moka pots work, it seems to me that getting my widest, lowest inductive pan and putting the moka pot in it should also work. Of course I wouldn't put a lid on the pan so only the bottom of the moka pot is heated up. Am I overlooking anything that could go wrong if I do it like this?

I am a complete amateur home baker so I realize that this question probably seems very basic, but I wanted to bake a cake for someone close to me who turned 90. The cake is meant to resemble the [Bent Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Pyramid) as much as possible.

I live in Europe and therefore would not understand references or abbreviations to shops that are common in other regions of the world. Here are my questions:

1 - I bought three square springform pans (S, M, L) and hoping by layering, I can achieve the basic pyramid shape, but how do I get the bent effect?

2 - What kind (not flavour) of topping or filling would you recommend and what colour do I use? In fact, how do I get the colours to resemble the Bent Pyramid exactly? I do not mind painting if that is a possible option but I do not know what ""surface"" to paint on (i.e. buttercream, ganache, etc.) Or do I go for something completely different? The less sweet the better, I often find American buttercream to be too sweet. I would also love to be able to replicate the texture of the pyramid if possible.

3 - On one or two of the sides I want to write ""Happy 90th birthday X"" and maybe draw a [cartouche ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche)on another side of the person's name in Ancient Egyptian. What can I use to write? I am not skilled enough with piping. I see there are gel pens around but do not know what to buy.

4 - Does the structure need reinforcement inside? If so, what is used to do so?

5 - I read that not all cake recipes are suitable for layered cakes, because they may not hold themselves up. Any guidance there? Flavours I am considering are chocolate coffee, pistachio (Sally's one looks good but I worry her recipes are too sweet), butter pecan or chocolate peanut butter.

Bialetti 2cup

Porlex mini II grinder

I usually grind at about 750μm (coarse, I know)

I mostly enjoy dark roasts since I have a dislike for acidic taste in coffee. I also mostly drink cappuccino.

Anyways. I've recently bought some aeropress paper filters to see if adding one to a moka pot is actually worth the hype and I've been severely unimpressed. I've brewed 8 cups of coffee in one morning for testing, used a different grind size setting for each, and the filter made all of them a lot worse. Except for no sediment in the final cup, there was no benefit - to me. The filter made all of the brews much more acidic and removed all the nuanced taste notes. Only on a pretty coarse grind (650μm) my mid-dark Peru finally had some of the nuttiness come through. And in none of the tests my natural mid roast Ethiopia had its fruitiness show up. Both roasts got extremely unpleasantly acidic at any setting I tried, between 400μm-750μm. I'm sure the paper just sucks in some of the natural oils or something, completely skewing the final taste of the coffee.

So for me, absolutely no good. I'm thinking about getting a metal filter and just pouring the finished coffee over it to get rid of the particles.",2,1764586158.0,mokapot,7,0.75,False

1pb9n0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoALL/comments/1pb9n0q/divination_tarotrandonautica_etc_is_just/,"Divination (Tarot/Randonautica etc.) is just ""Synchronicity on Demand"" via a Forced System Interrupt.","aka Reality is one giant cloud-gaming server - Part 5

For the newcomers: (Disclaimer: This is just my personal ""made-up"" logic to debug existence. Not The Truth, just a perspective). I view reality as a massive Latent Space (Potential) that gets rendered into Physical Reality by your consciousness acting as the Operating System. Your body is the hardware (locked to linear time), your mind is the Compiler. If you prompt with noise, you get a glitchy life. If you prompt with coherence, you play the game.

Today let´s talk about hacking the feedback loop.

I already discussed Synchronicities (Part 3) being the ""Recommendation Algorithm"" of reality. The universe sees your internal state and suggests matching external events. But what if you don't want to wait for the universe to suggest content? What if you want answers now?

That’s where Divination comes in (Tarot, I-Ching, Randonautica, tossing a coin). To the mystic, it’s ""asking the spirits."" To the Co-ALL theory (my server logic), it’s simply: Opening the Developer Console and forcing a Query.

The difference between the two mechanics:

**1. Synchronicity = Push Notification (Passive Mode)**

The server tracks your background activity (your obsession, your heartbreak, your joy, your misery). When the semantic weight is heavy enough, the algorithm sends you a ""Recommended for You"" notification. From best coincidence of your life to bad luck streak.

You didn't click anything.

The system pinged YOU based on your metadata. It’s like getting a YouTube recommendation for ""How to fix a flat tire"" right after your tire blows out. Helpful, but you are on the receiving end.

**2. Divination = Search Bar (Active Mode)**

Tarot, Randonautica, reading bones, coffee grounds or whatever you like to read (does not matter) is you actively stepping up to the console. You are not waiting.

The Input: You formulate a question (Intent).

The Mechanism: You introduce Randomness (Shuffling cards, Quantum RNG points).

The Output: The system is forced to render a response immediately.

**Why Randomness? (The ""Bias Breaker"")**

This is the crucial part. Why do we need to shuffle cards or roll dice? Why not just ""think"" the answer?

Because your Brain (The Compiler) is a Control Freak. Your brain runs on Predictive Processing Loops. It wants to verify what it already believes. If you are anxious, your brain will only calculate outcomes that confirm the anxiety. You are stuck in a local logic loop.

Randomness acts as a System Interrupt. It forces your Compiler to process a data point (e.g., ""The Tower Card"" or ""A random GPS coordinate in the woods"") that it did not select.

It breaks the prediction loop.

It forces a fresh calculation connecting ""Your Problem"" with ""This Symbol"".

It opens a bypass to the Latent Space (Subconscious/Server) because the logical mind is momentarily confused.

**Warning: Connection Quality (The Ping Matters)**

This is where people get skeptical, and rightfully so. ""But what about the lady on TV at 3 AM who reads cards for $5 a minute in 20 seconds?""

In this model, Divination is a Data Transfer. And data transfer depends on Bandwidth and Intention.

**Localhost (Reading for yourself):** Zero Ping. You know your context. If you feel a physical ""pull"" or resonance, you have Root Access. The interpretation is pure because the connection is direct.

**Shared Server (A good reader/friend)**: High Bandwidth. This requires Empathy (a secure handshake protocol). If the reader genuinely connects with you, they are accessing your Latent Space via a shared bridge.

**Phishing (The 3 AM Scam)**: The ""TV Psychic"" usually isn't running an empathetic query on your code. They are running a generic script (Greed\_Protocol.exe). They are not reading your data; they are spamming output to extract your resources. The connection is noisy, the interpretation is generic, and the ""magic"" is just cold reading (social engineering).

**Rule of Thumb:** If the interpretation feels like a generic horoscope, it's spam. If it hits you in the gut and unlocks a new perspective, it's a valid download.

By the way, you should weigh everything in life, whether it's spirituality, religion, friendships, or news. What does it do to me? Does it help me or harm me? (And yes, if you have to pay a fortune for something, that's also harm, just financial harm, but that counts in a world where money means survival too.)

**The Projector Screen (It's not the Card, it's You)**

Divination tools aren't magic artifacts. They are just an Index of Archetypes. The cards are just .png assets in the game folder. When you pull a card, you aren't reading the future. You are projecting your Hidden System State onto a random symbol.

You pull ""Death"".

If your system panics -> You are running Fear\_Protocol.exe.

If your system feels relief -> You are secretly queuing a Reboot\_Sequence.

**Conclusion:**

Divination is Manual Data Retrieval. It’s a hack to bypass your own logical firewall and see what code is actually running in the background. So if the passive stream isn't giving you answers... feel free to grab a deck of cards (or a coin or whatever floats your boat) and force a refresh. Just make sure your connection is secure.

laugh really hard

sneeze or cough

rush to the bathroom but don’t quite “make it”

do a workout or jump with your kids

From what I’ve been learning, it’s way more common than we think (especially after childbirth, in midlife, or around perimenopause).

Things that seem to help a bit for many women:

not holding pee for too long all day

cutting down on a bit of coffee and fizzy drinks

doing gentle pelvic floor exercises

and using something more discreet than pads, like leakproof underwear for light leaks

2.	⁠An agent that can trigger an email everytime there is a leadership change in one of the key telecom Operators. For example, new CEO joined telecom X, it should be able to trigger an email to alert internal stakeholders about the change and a bio/background of the new CEO.

3.	⁠Customer sentiment tool - a tool that can assimilate from Reddit and other social platforms what customers are saying about a particular brand.. in this case a telecom operator.

4.	⁠A network analysis tool that can provide information on download speed, upload speed, internet speeds and maps and can compare it across telecom operators and other countries.

1pb9fur,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1pb9fur/1122025/,1/12/2025,"**They met in a city that never slept**   
**but somehow, they only ever woke up for each other.**

Hao wasn’t a hero here.  
Not in this world of neon halos,  
flickering billboards,  
and people living too fast to feel.  
He was just a boy with tired eyes  
and a heartbeat that belonged to someone else.

She found him on a rooftop,  
sitting on the edge like he was negotiating with gravity.  
He wasn’t planning to jump.  
He was just trying to figure out  
why the world felt so heavy  
and why he still stayed.

She sat beside him without asking.  
Two strangers.  
One universe.  
And somehow the silence between them  
felt like the first real thing  
either had touched in years.

They didn’t fall in love.  
They crashed into it   
messy, reckless,  
like two meteors on a collision course  
who both knew  
the impact would ruin them  
and still didn’t slow down.

Their dates weren’t soft.  
They were neon-lit nights  
where the streets reflected like broken mirrors,  
where he told her about the ghosts in his chest  
and she traced constellations on his wrist  
like she could rewrite his past.

Love in their world wasn’t romantic.  
It was survival.  
It was choosing one person  
in a city full of noise,  
full of strangers,  
full of people pretending they didn’t break for fun.

But tragedy doesn’t need permission.  
It just needs a moment.

For them, it came at 3:17 AM  
in a hospital waiting room  
smelling like cheap coffee and electricity.  
The kind of night where hope  
is just another fluorescent light  
flickering overhead.

She didn’t leave.  
She couldn’t.  
Not when Hao was fighting  
a battle he never told her about:  
the kind that doesn’t show up on x-rays,  
the kind that lives in the soft cracks  
between “I’m fine”  
and “I’m falling apart.”

He held her hand like a secret,  
like a prayer whispered too late.

“Promise me,” he said,  
voice rough,  
eyes brighter than the monitors beside him,  
“that you’ll remember me  
not as I am now,  
but as who I tried to be  
when I was with you.”

And she broke   
quietly,  
beautifully,  
like glass learning how to breathe again.

Hao didn’t die that night.  
But something else did:  
their version of forever.

Because fate in the modern world  
doesn’t take lives   
it takes *timing.*

Now she walks the same streets alone,  
passing the same lights,  
seeing the same shadows,  
and every now and then  
she swears she hears his voice in the crowd,  
soft as a memory:

“In another life,  
in a slower world,  
I would’ve stayed.”

And maybe he would’ve.  
But this world was too fast,  
too bright,  
too loud  
for a love like theirs.

Some people are born for tragedy.  
Some for legend.  
Hao was both.  
And she will love him  
for the rest of her life  
in every universe  
where they almost had a chance.",3,1764585116.0,PoetryWritingClub,4,0.81,False
