For context, I’m a woman and whenever we (me and my colleagues, male and female) hang, I’m always the one to pay for everything first. Sometimes they’d only pay me back on payday. And the one calling me cheapskate is the one with no savings and never paid his CC on time.

Oh, and the “cheapest” coffee I went for costs around RM11 but thanks to MY grab voucher we all save around RM2-3/pax.

When you play Copa City, you won’t just be building fan zones, managing stadiums, or planning matchday logistics. You’ll be stepping into a world shaped by a humble yet very dedicated team — people who have lived both in the world of football and in the world of games.  
  
In our latest behind-the-scenes video, we open the doors to Triple Espresso. No flashy studios, no corporate gloss — just the place where Copa City is being made, and the people making it.  
  
From Jakub’s reflections on football as a culture, to Dominik’s first-hand stories from the streets on matchday, to our designers, artists, and engineers talking about the craft and challenge of building a living city event simulation — this is us.  
  
We’re not the biggest team. But we are one that believes in trust, ambition, and maybe a little too much coffee.  
  
And right now, we’re also opening up our Kickstarter pre-campaign. Wishlisting our game here and following us there is free, but it helps more than you might imagine — and seeing that number go up means the world to us.  
  
So, meet the faces behind Copa City. And if you like what you see, hit that “Follow” button on Kickstarter. We’ll take it from there.

Remember when we used to dream about making it big or at least making things a little easier? Well, I think it’s time we stop leaving money on the table! Seriously, let’s talk about monetizing that beautiful AI-generated content of ours *before* it’s too late!

**So, how can we cash in on that content goldmine?** Let me break it down for you:

1. **Affiliate Marketing:** You can create amazing content around a niche and sprinkle in affiliate links. People love recommendations! Why not make some dough while helping them out? Win-win, am I right?

2. **E-books and Guides:** Ever think about compiling your best AI content into something tangible? E-books can be a game-changer. Just think of how easily you can throw together insights and tips from your AI to create something people actually want to pay for.

3. **Online Courses:** You’re probably already sitting on tons of knowledge. Pack that wisdom into a course! Use AI to generate lessons, quizzes, and engaging material. Your audience will appreciate the solid value, and you can set your price!

4. **Membership Groups:** If you’ve found a niche community, why not create a subscription model? The AI can assist in generating exclusive content for your members while you sit back and sip your coffee. Sounds breezy, right?

5. **Sponsorships and Partnerships:** Companies are always looking for unique content to reach their audience. Why not reach out for sponsorships? Show them how your AI content can fit seamlessly into their marketing strategies.

6. **Content Repurposing:** Don’t let your content collect dust! Repurpose blog posts into videos, infographics, or podcasts. Not only does it save your sanity, but it casts a wider net for monetization opportunities!

You might be thinking, **""That sounds great, but where do I start?""** Honestly, just pick one! Test it out and see what resonates with your audience. The key is to act *now* because the content landscape is evolving fast. 

And let’s be real, we’re all familiar with that creeping feeling when we notice folks making money from things we already do, right? 😅 It’s time to transition from just “creators” to “entrepreneurs.” 

Here’s the kicker: **AI is not just a tool; it's an opportunity!** Let's leverage it to create something that pays off. Are you in? What’s been holding you back from putting your AI content to work? 

Here’s to creating not just great content but also a sustainable income! 🤑",1,1755173781.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Day 1: super motivated, super focused. But also a very good sleep the night before and it was sunny out so was that the meds or just a good mood?

Day 2: super foggy and kinda emotional. No appetite, which I expected, but I also got distracted a lot. I had one moment where I was working and realized, “oh, I’m still on task and it’s been 40 minutes.” That never happens. So maybe that’s the effect?

Day 3 (today): meh. Felt kind of flat emotionally. Not sad, just not much of anything. Focus was fine-ish but not perfect. I drank coffee and now I’m jittery. Also took a 2-hour nap mid-afternoon, which I didn't plan on.

I have a few friends or people I would call friends but it seems perhaps not as friendly as I originally thought. I had major surgery a few weeks ago, start of the summer holidays and no one came to visit, no one has mentioned doing meet ups with our kids who are all friends, it's how we met, and go to the same nursery / school in Sept. We've chatted on messenger about school uniforms mostly, we have a group chat but that's about it. Only one mum asked how I was after my surgery, no one remembered my birthday. I always have to initiate play dates no one else asks me it's always me coming up with ideas and trying to get together. 

One mum who I've become close with in the last 6 months to the point we hang out weekly. I took her cats to the vet and go get our nails done. She doesn't drive so we've taken to going shopping together and I see her 2-3 times a week term time, so I'd say we're close. It feels like she has just ditched me it feels like as soon as I wasn't useful as I couldn't drive due to the surgery for a few weeks. I took her out for lunch and to a rage room for her birthday, she forgot mine entirely. Says we'll do something in september when the kids go back, ok cool fine.

I just feel so crap like what is wrong with me why am I defective. I had tons of friends in school but since I became an adult nada. I put a lot of effort into my relationships, I show up and support them, their kids, I'll bring coffee and snacks, I am present, I remember important dates. I care. These are things which facilitate friendships or so I thought and yet I get none of it in return.  
To be clear I don't expect people to do things for me, or make a big fuss over me but I want people to remember I exist and want to spend time with me to initiate playdates.

I know people are busy. I am also busy. I am a part time uni student, I run a small business, I have my four year old, I'm a wife, I do the household stuff, I have hobbies and recently we moved home and I'm sorting all the house out, the garden, decorating etc etc yet I make time for people but no one makes time for me.

## key Features Analysis

The ideal cup shelf combines durability, functionality, and style to meet different needs and preferences.

**Material and Construction:** A cup shelf's durability hinges on the quality of its materials and construction. Common materials include wood, metal, and plastic, each offering distinct advantages. Wood adds warmth and a classic touch, metal ensures robustness and a modern look, and plastic provides affordability and water resistance.

A well-constructed wood cup-shelf will feature solid wood or high-quality plywood with a smooth finish and sturdy joints. Metal versions often incorporate powder-coated steel for rust prevention and longevity. Plastic models should use BPA-free,food-grade materials for safety. The overall construction should be able to withstand the weight of multiple cups without bending or sagging.

**Shelf Dimensions and Capacity:** The dimensions and capacity of the cup shelf dictate how many cups it can hold and how efficiently it utilizes space. Consider the sizes of your cups and mugs when choosing a shelf. Deeper shelves accommodate larger mugs, while wider shelves allow for more cups per row.

Shelf depth typically ranges from 4 to 12 inches, while shelf width can vary significantly depending on the design. A multi-tiered shelf maximizes vertical space, offering ample storage in a compact footprint. Always ensure adequate clearance between shelves to easily access cups without hitting the shelf above.

**Mounting Options and Stability:** How the cup shelf mounts to the wall or stands on a countertop is crucial for stability and safety.Wall-mounted shelves free up counter space and provide a clean, streamlined look. These shelves should come with the necessary hardware and clear instructions for secure installation.

Countertop shelves need a stable base to prevent tipping, especially when fully loaded with cups. Non-slip feet or pads can enhance stability on smooth surfaces. Consider the weight-bearing capacity of the mounting system or the stability of the base to ensure the shelf remains steady under normal use.

**Style and Aesthetics:** The cup shelf should complement the existing décor of your kitchen or dining room.Styles range from rustic and farmhouse to modern and minimalist. Wood shelves offer a warm, traditional feel, while metal shelves provide a sleek, contemporary look.

Colour, finish, and design details can significantly impact the shelf's aesthetic appeal. Choose neutral tones like white, black, or natural wood to match various color schemes. Decorative accents, such as carved details or wireframe designs, can add visual interest.Select a style that aligns with your personal taste and the overall ambiance of your space.**Adjustability and Customization:** Some cup shelves offer adjustable shelves or customizable configurations to accommodate different cup sizes and storage needs. The ability to reposition shelves allows you to create more space for taller mugs or stack smaller cups.

Modular shelves can be combined to create larger storage solutions, while shelves with removable dividers enable you to organize cups more efficiently. The level of adjustability can increase the shelf's versatility and adaptability as your needs evolve.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** A cup shelf should be easy to clean and maintain to ensure hygiene and longevity. Materials like metal and plastic are naturally water-resistant and can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. Wood shelves may require occasional sealing or polishing to protect against moisture and stains.

Consider shelves with smooth surfaces and minimal crevices to prevent the accumulation of dust and grime. removable shelves make cleaning easier, allowing you to wipe down all surfaces thoroughly. Regular cleaning and maintenance will help keep your cup shelf looking and functioning its best.

1mpyveq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROKespresso/comments/1mpyveq/im_considering_buying_a_used_rok_original_and/,I'm considering buying a used ROK (Original) and have a couple ?s,"1. Is the Commercial GC upgrade still available? I'm looking at the options for upgrade in the US (with the tariff and *de minimus* elimination BS upon us), and it looks like ROK direct is my only realistic options.  I was going to consider the commercial upgrade, but it no longer seems to be available at [ROK.coffee](http://ROK.coffee); only the GC upgrade is available. 

2. Is there even a need for the pressure gauge? In the ROK discussions re: upgrades, everyone seems absolutely certain that the pressure gauge is critical to getting a consistent pull. I ask because 90% of the Cafelat Robot discussions say the opposite - the pressure gauge may be good for beginners, but feeling constant pressure for a proper extraction rate (ml/s) once you have a good grind makes the gauge redundant. Even Cafelat recommends against the gauge.

I am of the belief, that for most, that should be around the price of a cup of coffee, or perhaps a venti Frappachino.

In order to deserve this, you need to be beautiful, and you need to take selfies constantly.

Now, while I say you have to be beautiful, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and everyone has someone out there that will think they're hot. The question is how many will be willing to buy you a cup of coffee every month?

Knowing your audience, finding them, and letting them know you exist is the hard part. BUT this is something I can assist with. Getting them to subscribe for a Frappachino a month won't happen immediately. They have to have the FOMO of what is behind the paywalls.

Now, there are many people who are currently going for free OF accounts that expire after 30 days, and then recur at a charge. While this logic is sound, it makes the user actually go in and resubscribe to the channel. It doesn’t work.

A better strategy is to build a sexy social media presence, maybe not SFW, but close…. This is all about the tease, and what your audience likes.

I'd check Slack, prune my to-do list, and nibble emails until 10:00. I changed five tiny things and the compound effect surprised me.

**What changed**

• **Verbal plan**: a 3-minute brain dump into **WillowVoice** (top three, must-nots, lurking anxiety) → paste to today's note.

• **Calendar guardrails**: two 90-minute deep-work holds that auto-decline non-critical invites.

• **Quiet-by-default**: Slack DND until 11:00; email opened only at :55 to avoid rabbit holes.

• **Single-window mode**: FocusFrame so only the active app is bright; everything else fades.

• **Commute loop**: an 8-minute walk before laptop-coffee in hand, no podcasts.

**Why it works**

Voice planning externalizes the noise; the calendar and visual dimming prevent accidental multitasking. The walk is silly but flips my brain into ""arrival.""

For seven years, Soraya poured her soul into her family. When her husband and daughter gave their love to the mistress, something inside her shattered. She walked away and never looked back.

\*\*\*

\~ Soraya \~

“No! I don’t want you! I want Aunt Rose!” Soraya’s daughter, Sage, screamed. “I want her to come to school with Daddy!”

Those words were like multiple knives that stabbed through Soraya’s heart. Her daughter preferred her husband’s mistress to accompany her to school.

“But, Sage, I’m your mom,” Soraya tried to reason, but her daughter only threw a tantrum, hurling the vase in the living room and screaming.

“But I like Aunt Rose. She is pretty and talented, and Dad likes her very much!” Sage retorted, further tightening the feeling in Soraya’s chest. “If I go with you, Dad won’t come!”

How could her daughter, the one she carried in her womb for nearly ten months and raised for six years, choose another woman over her?

Soraya had already accepted that her husband would never love her, but what about her daughter? Why had she become so distant from her?

Clenching her jaw, Soraya blamed it all on her husband, Calum Montclair. He was the one who introduced Sage to his “girlfriend.” He sent Soraya across the world under the guise of a business trip, allowing her daughter to bond with his mistress.

Back then, he said, “I need you to close a deal in Singapore.”

When she returned four months ago, Soraya learned about Rose and her growing relationship with her husband and daughter.

A tear rolled down Soraya’s face. She approached her daughter and knelt before her. She asked, “Sage, Baby… don’t you love Mommy anymore?”

Sage tried to open her mouth but instead snapped her head in the other direction, her arms folded against her chest. “I just want to spend more time with Aunt Rose.”

Soraya got up and gave Sage her back. She took deep breaths as she placed her hands on her hips. After gathering her composure, she said, “Okay. If that’s what makes you happy… but you must promise to spend time with me tomorrow.”

She wiped the tears that flooded her face and turned to her daughter. “It’s your special day, and we always spend it together, remember?”

Her daughter instantly looked guilty. She opened her mouth, about to say something, but instead gulped. “Okay, Mommy. I’m sorry.”

‘At least she still remembers,’ Soraya thought.

She checked the time, and seeing it was almost nine, she said, “Let’s go. You’re going to be late.”

While heading out, she called her husband, Calum. At first, he hung up the phone. He often did. To Calum, Soraya had never been an equal partner.

She had to text him the exact reason for her call: \[Sage doesn’t want to come with me to the parent-teacher activity. She wants Rose.\]

When Soraya and Sage reached the car, her husband replied: \[Rose and I will be at school. Bring Sage over.\]

The drive to Evermoor Academy was long and agonizing. It took everything in Soraya not to break down and cry. Now and then, she would glance at the rearview mirror, hoping to get a reaction from her daughter—anything.

But Sage avoided her gaze the entire time. It was as if the daughter she raised was now a stranger.

When they arrived at the school, Soraya waited. After half an hour, Calum’s Bentley finally pulled over in front of her. He stepped out of the car in his custom-made suit, his tall frame and chiseled features ever so defined. Then, he walked over to the other side and opened the passenger door.

He helped Rose out of the vehicle, his hand gently wrapped around hers.

Wearing a tailored red business dress, Rose carried herself with the quiet confidence of a seasoned professional. Her elegantly wavy blonde hair and expensive jewelry made her look exceptionally sophisticated.

Everyone outside the school gates turned to Calum and Rose with awe. Soraya could tell that they all thought they made a great couple.

‘Perhaps they do make a great couple,’ Soraya thought. After all, Calum, the CEO of the Montclair Group and the wealthiest man in Cedar Heights, was the one who had transformed their family business into a thriving empire. Rose Becket was said to be a gifted entrepreneur, having started a fashion line immediately after her doctoral degree.

“Aunt Rose!” Sage excitedly got out of the car.

Soraya had to rush out and chase after her daughter to ensure Sage’s safety. She thought she had prepared herself for whatever heartbreak she would witness, but she was dead wrong.

She saw Sage leap into Rose’s arms. The two were happy to be together as if they were truly mother and daughter. And as for Calum, he had that gentle smile on his face, an affection he never once gave Soraya.

Soraya’s knees nearly gave way. Her heart was aching so much that she felt like she could die at any minute.

In their “happy family,” Soraya was the outsider. She was the villain in their eyes, especially Calum.

After standing there like a fool for almost a minute, she finally caught Calum’s cold stare. He said indifferently, “You can go now.”

Soraya hesitated. She directed her gaze to Sage, asking, “Sage, tomorrow. You promised.”

Sage did not say anything. She just nodded.

Meanwhile, Soraya caught the triumphant look on Rose’s face. It angered her to the core. The confidence in this woman, who dared get involved with a married man, was just too much!

The trio did not stay any longer. They entered the school grounds with smiles on their faces.

Just as she was about to turn to her car, Sage’s teacher, Miss Gale, bumped into her.

“Mrs. Montclair! I’m sorry,” Miss Gale said with a smile. “I’m glad to see you. Are you attending today’s activity?”

The teacher frowned and shared, “Lately, another woman and Mr. Montclair have been picking up Sage from school. I—I wonder if—”

“I know,” Soraya responded bitterly. “It’s fine. It is what it is.”

“I’m—I’m sorry.” Miss Gale caught up quickly. She grieved for Soraya, on the verge of tears. If anyone, this teacher had witnessed all of Soraya’s sacrifices for Sage in school.

When Sage got hurt or sick while in school, Soraya always came to her daughter’s aid. Soraya attended most school activities without Calum.

“Don’t take it to heart, Mrs. Montclair. Sage... she—she doesn’t understand yet,” Miss Gale tried to comfort her, but honestly, it did not help.

The heaviness in Soraya’s chest continued to weigh down on her even as she prepared for Sage’s birthday celebration at home. She baked a cake and prepared special dishes that Sage would love to eat. After prepping for tomorrow, she went to the bedroom to rest.

Soraya had taken a week off from work, hoping to spend time with her daughter.

She deserved it.

Four years ago, under the pressure of Cedric and Amanda Montclair, Calum’s parents, Soraya quit her high-paying job to work for her husband as part of his support staff. The Montclair couple wanted her to work harder and win their son’s love. But the love Soraya longed for never came. Instead, Calum’s hate for her grew stronger.

Soraya had come to terms with the fact that Calum would never love her. The only reason she remained in their marriage was because of Sage, but even now, her daughter was slipping away.

“No,” Soraya muttered as she lay herself on the bed. “Sage will come back to me. I’m her mom. She loves me.”

She was emotionally exhausted and soon drifted to sleep.

When Soraya woke up, it was already late at night. She frowned, turning to the other side of the bed, finding it empty. She walked out of the master bedroom, calling the maid, “Belinda? Have Calum and Sage arrived?”

“Belinda?” she called again.

It took a while for the maid to come upstairs and address Soraya. The latter said, “Mrs. Montclair, Mr. Montclair, and the young miss have not arrived yet.”

A sense of panic washed over her. Soraya called her husband, but Calum dropped the call. She texted him, but he didn’t answer.

Knowing that her daughter brought her tablet, Soraya texted Sage through a messaging app. It was always how they communicated when they were apart. She waited until two check marks appeared, suggesting her daughter had seen the message.

Soraya sent another text: \[Hi, Baby. Where are you? Don’t forget, we will spend time together on your birthday.\]

Again, two check marks appeared.

Soraya’s fingers trembled as she stared at the screen.

The message had been seen, but the silence that followed cut deeper than betrayal.

Her daughter was slipping away, and she couldn’t stop it.

# Chapter 2: Not Invited

\~ Rose \~

In a high-end luxury penthouse, Rose was reading Sage a bedtime story. As she did, the young girl looked around the room, her eyes widened in wonder.

Rose was pleased. After all, she had prepared the room for Sage.

The bed was big and fluffy, with light curtains hanging from the window. On the walls were posters of Sage’s favorite girl band. Her favorite books were stacked neatly on the table beside the bed.

Rose had gone all out like it was for someone she deeply cared about.

Why? Because Sage cared. That’s what made her so easy to spoil… so easy to win.

Rose had watched her quietly over the past few months, noticing how Sage lit up with attention and gifts, and how she softened with kindness. And as Soraya started slipping from Sage’s thoughts, Rose didn’t have to say much.

A small comment here, a quiet smile there… It was enough.

Sometimes, love wasn’t stolen. It was gently replaced.

And Rose knew how to do that, especially with a child who still believed the world was kind.

“The end,” her Aunt Rose said after closing the book.

“Aunt Rose, your house looks very new and expensive too,” Sage said.

“Your dad bought it for me. That’s how much he cares about me,” Rose replied.

“Why doesn’t Daddy care for Mommy?” Sage asked. “If only he would care for her and show up at home to celebrate my birthday.”

Rose shrugged and said, “To care for someone, you can’t force it.”

She did not know if Sage would understand, but she hoped the little girl would. After all, Calum never cared for Soraya. They were married, but there was never a real relationship between them.

At best, Soraya was a mere surrogate.

“But Mommy loves me,” Sage said, looking conflicted.

“Oh, my poor baby.” Rose offered an embrace. She hugged Sage. “I know your mom loves you. But sometimes love isn’t enough to keep a family together.”

“Are you sure about tomorrow? Aunt Rose and your daddy can always step away for your Mommy,” Rose suggested.

Sage shook her head. She said, “No, I want to be with you and Daddy on my birthday.”

A triumphant smile spread across Rose’s face. She had been patient, but she knew it wouldn’t be long now. Surely, with everything going on, Soraya would break.

After putting Sage to sleep, Rose smiled. She walked back to the study where Calum had been working on his laptop.

She said, “Sage is asleep.”

“Good,” Calum simply said, his fingers still working on the keyboard.

“I think I have totally won her over,” Rose claimed, walking toward him and sitting on his lap. “You didn’t think I’d be able to do it, did you?”

Calum stopped whatever he was doing and wrapped his arms around Rose. “Hmmm. You did well.”

Rose kissed Calum, and in the next few minutes, the sensual moans filled the air.

She rejoiced inside. There was no sweeter victory than having the wealthiest man in the city wrapped around her finger.

\*\*\*

\~ Soraya \~

The next day.

It was supposed to be a day of celebration, but at home, there was no knock, no ring, and no laughter in the dining hall. There was simply silence and food that had gone cold.

Soraya checked the time. It was seven in the evening. The candles were ready, and her gifts were stacked neatly. But still, Sage and Calum had not returned.

‘Where were they?’

‘Where had they slept overnight?’

‘Did Sage even think about me?’

‘Is this my fault?’

‘Am I not enough?’

Soraya had so many questions.

She looked pitiful while sitting before the chocolate cake she had made for her princess. Again, she tried to call Calum, but just as before, he did not answer.

Tears welled in her eyes as she scoffed bitterly. Turning to the maid, she asked, “Belinda, am I a bad mother?”

“No, Mrs. Montclair. You have always loved Sage. Please don’t blame her. Sage is still young,” Belinda said, teary-eyed in her presence.

“I need to… get some fresh air,” Soraya said, her beautiful face completely worn out.

She drove around town for almost an hour. Then, she pulled over at Butter & Crumb, one of Sage’s favorite cafés. The store had the best ice cream. Soraya remembered many afternoons spent with her daughter in this café.

She felt like she needed to be a kid again and eat a gallon of the best ice cream in town.

The Butter & Crumb café was a huge establishment. Aside from the main café, it had an outdoor area designated for special events.

Soraya had paid for her ice cream when she overheard the joyous singing in the garden area.

It was someone’s birthday.

“Happy Birthday to you!”

“Happy Birthday to you!”

“Happy Birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, dear Sage. Happy birthday to you!”

Immediately, Soraya’s heart stopped. Her feet dragged her to the outdoor area of the café. What she saw made her face pale, her dignity washed away.

Balloons floated lazily in the breeze. Laughter danced like music across the garden.

And in the center of it all was Sage, in someone else’s arms.

To others, it was a beautiful scene. Rose was carrying Sage while Calum clapped his hands. The crowd cheered as the trio blew out the candle on the giant fondant birthday cake.

Sage did not even like fondant cake, but she looked happy.

Around them were Calum’s social circle, his wealthy friends, and two of his cousins.

“Sage, are you happy to celebrate your birthday with Rose?” Claire, Calum’s cousin, asked Sage.

“Yes, of course! I love being with Aunt Rose!” Sage said, wrapping her arms around Rose with a beaming smile. “Even my classmates also like Aunt Rose. She is smart and pretty. She dresses really nice and wears nice jewelry!”

“We are happy for you, Sage!” someone said.

“We are happy for all of you!” Calum’s cousin raised a glass, referring to Sage, Rose, and Calum.

From where Soraya stood, she overheard everything.

Soraya, yet again, questioned her life choices and the sacrifices she had made for her family. ‘Was it worth it?’

Right now, it did not feel like it.

What further added to Soraya’s resentment was how Rose was warmly welcomed by Calum’s friends.

Never had Calum brought Soraya to any of his friends’ gatherings. However, it was so much easier to flaunt Rose in front of them. As for Calum’s parents, Soraya knew they never approved of Rose. After all, she was a mistress.

Soraya could not accept it.

The gallon of ice cream fell on the floor. She froze, feeling like she wanted to die.

She wanted to cry and walk in and scream! But something far worse inside her shattered.

Something deep and profound, something that could never fully mend.

Her eyes narrowed, and her heart turned cold.

Soraya knew now what she must do.

She turned on her heel, seething. Just as she exited the café, she bumped into a tall, overbearing man on the street.

“What are you doing here? Don’t cause any trouble. It’s Sage’s birthday!” he warned. This man was Jacob Steel, one of Calum’s friends, a high-profile businessman in Belridge, the neighboring town. Like Calum, Jacob had that icy charisma and the unmistakable air of affluence.

Hearing Jacob’s remark, Soraya retorted, “Cause trouble? Me? Why would you think that, Mr. Steel?”

“Do you think I’m the evil one here? Do you really think I wanted this?!” Soraya snapped. She couldn’t help it. All of Calum’s friends had judged her the moment she got pregnant with Sage. “I’m still twenty-six. I got married at nineteen and threw away my life and career for Calum and Sage!”

“You all judged me, but you never really tried finding out the truth!” Soraya’s face burned with anger. “Fine, let me be the bad person! It doesn’t matter. I don’t care anymore!”

She turned her back on Jacob and marched toward her car. Just like that, she left.

Soraya returned home and packed up her things. Then, she called her Uncle Philip.

“Uncle,” Soraya said.

“Soraya? What’s wrong? You sound sick,” her uncle said. “Please don’t tell me it’s Calum.”

“Uncle? Can I stay with you? I want to divorce Calum,” Soraya said. “I’m tired. I don’t want to do this anymore.”

Her uncle’s family had long moved to Belridge. Only Soraya remained in Cedar Heights to stay with Calum and Sage. She needed to be away fast, somewhere she felt she belonged.

“And… Soraya, what about Sage?” her uncle asked.

Soraya thought about it and said, “Sage… she—she doesn’t need me anymore.”

# Chapter 3: Choose Herself

\~ Soraya \~

“Hi? What’s your name?” the fourteen-year-old Soraya greeted with a smile. She was attending Cedric Montclair’s birthday party. Upon seeing Calum, she immediately approached.

Of course, Soraya already knew who he was. The Montclair and Azar families had lived across from each other for years.

“Calum,” the young Montclair heir said. He shook his head like he already knew there was no need for introductions.

“Can we be friends, Calum?” she asked.

He just shrugged, and Soraya took it as an approval.

There was a time when Soraya and Calum got along just fine. Their families were close, and being neighbors, Soraya saw his achievements and grew to admire Calum.

Yes, Calum was a handsome man. He was tall and athletic, with brown hair and sharp blue eyes. But Soraya didn’t fall for just his looks. She loved the quiet strength he carried. He didn’t talk much, but when he did, people listened. He took over the family business at a young age, and even then, he acted with the seriousness of someone much older.

Yet life had a way of turning everything upside down.

One crucial night changed everything, forcing them into marriage.

That was when Calum started hating Soraya. He firmly believed she had orchestrated the events leading up to her pregnancy.

Soraya had hoped she could win Calum’s heart. After all, she was young, bright, and attractive. She had an angelic beauty, with long, sleek caramel hair that cascaded down her back and skin as fair as ivory. She did not have to wear heavy makeup or provocative clothes to stand out. Aside from her natural qualities, Calum’s parents adored her.

However, throughout their marriage, Calum treated her with disdain. He ignored her, and the worst part was how he allowed his friends to look down on her. And now, he flaunted a mistress without even batting an eye.

There was no other way to go around it. Soraya needed to choose herself, or else she would be that useless person Calum’s friends had labeled her to be.

Soraya had stayed with her uncle for the past few days. One would think that, despite her absence, her husband would call or be concerned—but no. He never called or texted.

Calum didn’t care.

In fact, since their marriage, Calum had sent her no more than fifty messages. They were either purely business or matters related to Sage.

They did not celebrate their anniversary. Calum never came to her birthday celebration, and unless the party was held at the Montclair mansion, Soraya was never invited to his birthday party.

Sage, however, had sent Soraya two messages on the chat app, but she chose not to read them. Soraya was afraid of giving in, afraid of being rejected once again, and afraid of falling into the trap she had been under for the past seven years.

\*\*\*

On a Thursday, Soraya sat at her desk, her laptop open, screens glowing with charts, notes, and color-coded plans. She had made a schedule and was sticking to it. Everything had its place: the market data on the left, a checklist of tasks in the center, and a list of safe, quiet apartments on the right. After the divorce, she needed a new home and a new routine.

On her priority list was a visit to Aegis Core Systems and to meet an old friend.

Just as she was planning her life, she received a text from her college best friend, Lyra Hayes.

Lyra: \[Soraya! What the fuck is going on?\]

Then, Lyra sent a picture of Calum. He was impeccably dressed, with Rose clinging to his arm. Rose was smiling at Calum, her gaze flirtatious.

Lyra: \[I’m attending the mayor’s birthday party, and I overheard some people say this woman is Calum’s girlfriend!\]

For a moment, Soraya struggled to breathe. Her hands shook as she looked at the image.

She wanted to cry, but instead, she returned to her computer and stared at her outlined plans.

‘Breathe,’ she told herself. You have already made your decision.

Soraya closed her eyes and counted numbers, regaining control of her emotions once more. “...Four, three, two, one.”

She took deep breaths and reset the logic.

When she opened her eyes, she returned to her phone.

Lyra: \[Talk to me right now! Or I’m storming in and slapping that woman’s face!\]

Soraya quickly called her friend. “Don’t do that. You know Calum has a lot of power in the city. He could cause problems for your family’s business. It’s not worth it, Lyra.”

“But—”

“I’m divorcing him, Lyra. I can’t take it anymore,” Soraya revealed.

She could hear her friend’s struggle to accept things. Lyra was on the verge of tears. “But you love him so much.”

“I have reached my limit. I want to work on myself,” Soraya said softly.

“Okay. Okay. You know what? You are right. You should have left that asshole a long time ago!” Lyra went on but then paused. “But what about Sage?”

Her friend finally remembered why Soraya held on so long.

“Sage? She needs a mother that she can be proud of,” Soraya said. “I need time to be that person for her.”

Lyra had been away, working in another city. Soraya did not even know when she came back to Cedar Heights. Thus, it did not come as a surprise that Lyra was unaware of Rose, the new woman in Calum’s life.

She told her friend everything, including Sage’s newfound affection for Rose. At the end of her narrative, Lyra said while weeping, “I wish I were there for you. I will hug you forever!”

“Me too.” This time, Soraya allowed herself to shed a tear. “But we can catch up next week. I will collect that hug. Let’s see how forever lasts for you.”

When Lyra laughed, Soraya found herself smiling for the first time in months.

“We should have a reunion—you, me, and Silas,” Lyra proposed, mentioning a common friend.

“That’s on my priority list. I’ll give you a call when I’m back at Cedar Heights,” Soraya said before finally ending their conversation.

Soraya returned to reviewing her solid plan. According to her timeline, her goals would unfold over the next two to three years.

Little did she know that the moment she set her plans in motion, opportunities would come knocking faster and louder than she ever anticipated.

# Chapter 4: Resigned

\~ Soraya \~

On a Monday, Soraya drove back to Cedar Heights early in the morning. It was an hour-and-a-half drive.

She was already four blocks away when she noticed Calum’s car!

Yet again, she sensed her heart racing. She had to pull over and calm her emotions. With her eyes closed, she muttered, “Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen… one.”

As her eyes slowly opened, she spotted Calum’s Bentley parked two cars down. Moments later, Calum stepped out and opened the passenger door, letting Rose Becket exit with a bright smile.

Soraya looked away, realizing that Calum and Rose were together as early as seven. It could only mean they had slept together. Worse, maybe he had brought Rose to their marital home.

Her chest tightened, so much that counting numbers no longer worked.

Soraya hugged herself tightly and muttered her newfound mantra, “Control, Soraya, control. Feelings pass. Feelings pass. Control.”

It took a while, but when Soraya had finally regained her composure, she realized Calum had brought Rose to her boutique.

During their entire marriage, Calum never drove Soraya to work, not even after she started working for him. The only times they shared a car were when they visited the Montclairs at the old mansion.

So, apparently, Calum did have a romantic side. However, he never cared for Soraya.

A bitter smile tugged at Soraya’s lips. She let the truth sink in deeper, letting her anger sharpen her resolve. This low point was only temporary; her comeback was already coming.

After Calum left Rose’s shop, Soraya waited five minutes before driving off in the same direction.

At Montclair Group, she headed straight to Calum’s executive assistant.

Greg Foster greeted her, “Miss Azar. Good morning. Welcome back.”

Yes, Soraya still went with her maiden name, Azar. In public, Calum had never acknowledged her as his wife. Everyone thought he was single, and Rose Becket was his girlfriend. Only a few knew that, in reality, Calum was married and that Rose was a mistress.

Greg Foster, for one, knew Soraya and Calum were married.

“Good morning, Mr. Foster,” Soraya responded to Greg, her face neutral, trying to cage all her feelings. She gave him a set of documents and said, “I would like to tender my resignation effective immediately. And the second document is a divorce agreement for Mr. Montclair. I know he will not want to see me, but will you please pass this to him?”

The shock on Greg’s face was evident. His eyes rounded, and his mouth fell open. Obviously, he could not believe that Soraya had finally given up. “Are—are you sure?”

Soraya held her chin high, saying, “I have never been more surer in my life. I hope you can manage my unplanned departure. I can’t stay here a day longer.”

Greg seemed to understand her sentiment. It reflected in his eyes.

Soraya had a good relationship with Calum’s executive assistant. In fact, Greg had often tried to speak positively about her to Calum. But in her husband’s eyes, she was just there to get his attention. Not once did Calum ask about her work, what she did, or how well she performed.

Greg looked around, and with a nod, he said, “We have enough people.”

“Good luck, Miss Azar. I wish you all the best,” Greg said, forcing a smile. “It won’t be the same without you. I’ve never met anyone so meticulous and laser-focused. Thank you for everything. You’ll do great in whatever you pursue.”

“Then,” Soraya gave a faint smile, “I’ll clear my desk. I thank you for everything you have done for me.”

After Montclair Group, she drove straight to Aegis Core Systems. If she needed a fresh start, she would require a lot of money.

Aegis Core Systems was a top-tier cybersecurity firm known for its enterprise-grade protection. It had built a multi-million-dollar empire by supplying advanced security solutions to major corporations.

Its most profitable system was the NeuroSentinel.

Soraya parked her car and went straight to the upper ground floor. Approaching the front desk, Soraya said, “Excuse me. My name is Soraya Azar. I want to claim my profit share for the past four years.”

“Do you have a licensing profit share, Miss?” the front desk asked with a smile.

“Yes,” Soraya replied.

The lady called the person in charge, and after confirming that Soraya was, in fact, a developer of one of their programs, she gave her an ID pass.

Soraya easily found her way to the finance department. The person in charge gave her a big smile. He looked tense as he offered his hand, “Miss Azar, it’s such an honor to meet you! And my, you are so young and beautiful!”

“I’m sorry. I never expected you to be this young, but then again, most geniuses are young.” The man motioned to a seat and said, “Please, have some coffee or tea.”

“Thank you for the compliment.” Soraya’s heart was still like a block of ice, but she forced a smile. “Water is fine. Is the check ready? I called last Wednesday to make the withdrawal.”

“Yes, it’s ready. I prepared the check. I was very excited to meet you,” the man said. “My name is Albert Smith. I am the accounts payable manager. I started working here two years ago and heard so much about you from Mr. Ward.”

Soraya could not help but smile at the mention of her old friend, Silas Ward. Her heart softened a little. She asked, “I’d really like to see Silas. Is he here at the moment?”

“Mr. Ward is on a business trip. He has been a busy man, following our expansion to the capital. After all, he is now the big boss,” Albert remarked, chuckling.

“The big boss?” Soraya asked, bemused.

“You don’t know?” Albert asked. “Mr. Ward is now the CEO of Aegis Core Systems. He had his appointment last month. After your collaborative effort with Mr. Ward, he quickly rose from a Tech Engineer to a project manager, VP, and now, the boss.”

“I believe he used his profit share to buy company shares of Aegis Core Systems,” Albert reported.

Soraya’s mouth fell open in disbelief.

Her dear old friend had made it big!

And then it hit her like a slap: if she hadn’t abandoned her career at Aegis Core Systems, she could have been standing beside Silas by now.

Yes, this was her first workplace after completing her Computer Engineering degree at Cedar Heights Institute of Technology.

Soraya was an accelerated student. She skipped four grade levels, earned her high school diploma at fourteen, and completed her college degree by eighteen. After graduation, her internship company, Aegis Core Systems, immediately offered her a job, and she began working under the mentorship of Silas Ward.

Because of her busy schedule, taking care of Sage while working hard for Calum, Soraya had not been in touch with Silas. She wasn’t the type to have a social media account either. In the middle of everything, Soraya had lost her old phone, leaving her with no way to contact Silas.

“I am happy for Silas,” Soraya said. Then, she wrote her number on a piece of paper, handing it to Albert. “Do you mind telling him that I came to see him? Here’s my number. I changed contact information three years ago.”

“Certainly, Miss Azar. When he returns, I shall give him your number.” Albert put her contact information inside his drawer. Then, he said, “Excuse me for a moment. I just need to get the acknowledgment paper for your check.”

Albert came back with the document, which Soraya quickly signed. Then, Albert passed her the check, shocking Soraya to the core. “I earned six million dollars in four years?”

That was ten times more than what she had expected. It was primarily the reason why she took so long to withdraw her profit share. Soraya was saving it for rainy days.

Then, the gut punch.

“Miss Azar,” Albert said. “You would have earned ten times more if you hadn’t given up your exclusive rights as the co-developer of NeuroSentinel.”

The goal of titration is to give your body just enough methylation support to work better without tipping it into the unpleasant state of overmethylation.

This is not medical advice and I’m not a doctor. I’m laying out what’s common in functional medicine and what I’ve learned from my own process. A few points here are debated, and I’ll flag those so you know where there is no universal consensus.

**Step 1: Prepare before starting**  
Before you start dosing, get a baseline. Conventional doctors may not run any extra labs unless you have obvious deficiency symptoms. Functional medicine practitioners are more likely to check things like homocysteine, RBC folate, active B12, vitamin D, magnesium, and other cofactors that can affect methylation.

Even if you skip the labs, it helps to have a symptom baseline. Track your energy, mood, sleep quality, and anything that tends to flare up when you are unwell.

**Step 2: Understand the main players**  
The two most important supplements for MTHFR support are methylfolate (B9) and active B12. Methylfolate is the form your body can use directly without converting folic acid. Typical starting range is 200 to 800 mcg. Active B12 is usually methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin, with a typical starting range of 500 to 1,000 mcg.

There is broad agreement that you should take both together. Without enough B12, methylfolate can make things worse.

Other common cofactors include riboflavin (B2) for MTHFR enzyme function, magnesium for hundreds of enzymatic reactions, trimethylglycine (TMG) for homocysteine recycling, and potassium which some people find drops when methylation ramps up (anecdotal, not consensus).

**Step 3: Start low**  
Start low enough that your body barely notices the change, then build slowly. For methylfolate, that means 200 to 800 mcg depending on your sensitivity. For B12, start at 500 to 1,000 mcg in an active form if possible. If you only have inactive B12 (cyanocobalamin), you may need a higher mcg to feel anything, but switching to active later can make a lower number feel stronger.

**Step 4: Hold steady**  
Stay at your starting dose for at least a week, preferably two. Methylation affects neurotransmitters, energy cycles, and detox pathways, so shifts are not always immediate. Sometimes you feel fine at first, then wired or anxious days later.

**Step 5: Increase slowly**  
When it’s time to increase, go small. Add 200 to 400 mcg methylfolate or 500 mcg B12 at a time. If you are already sensitive, even smaller steps are fine. Some people do well at 800 mcg folate and 1,000 mcg B12 indefinitely. Others eventually reach higher doses, but usually after months of gradual work.

**Step 6: Watch for signs of overmethylation**  
Functional medicine often talks about overmethylation as a cluster of symptoms from too much methyl support. Conventional medicine does not formally recognize it, but many people report clear symptoms. These include anxiety, irritability, headaches, feeling wired but tired, early waking, palpitations, and sometimes nausea. If these show up, pause or lower your dose. Some people use a little nicotinic acid (niacin) to calm things down, though this is anecdotal.

**Step 7: Track everything**  
A log is your best friend. Write down doses, symptoms, and any other changes like illness, travel, or sleep disruption. It helps you spot patterns instead of guessing.

**Step 8: Adjust with context in mind**  
If your sleep is bad because you have a cold, your low energy may not be from the supplements. Likewise, if you increase B12 the same day you drink a lot of coffee, the jitteriness might not be from methylation support. Holding steady through unrelated health disruptions gives clearer data.

**Step 9: Remember cofactors and lifestyle**  
Folate and B12 do not work in isolation. Stress, diet, gut health, and nutrient status all influence how your body handles methylation. You may need to shore up magnesium, riboflavin, or other basics before you notice much from B9 and B12 changes.

**The bottom line for the general guide**  
Start low, go slow, and watch for changes over time rather than expecting immediate transformation. Pair folate with active B12 whenever possible, and do not ignore the rest of your nutrient picture.

**What I’ve done so far**  
My B9 has always been 800 mcg when I take it. I started with inactive B12 because I did not have access to the active form. Once I could get active B12, I switched to a lower mcg, but it still felt stronger.

Alongside this, I’ve been taking magnesium, zinc, CoQ10, spirulina, chlorella, probiotics, and some adaptogens. None of these were aimed directly at methylation support, but they influence overall energy and recovery.

So far, I have not noticed strong positive effects. My energy is low, I’ve had a mild headache, and my sleep schedule is off. I believe this is mainly because I have been sick, which can mask any benefits from the supplements.

I'm curious how others have handled their titration schedules and what the effects have been. Feel free to chime in!",1,1755172910.0,MTHFR,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The foosball cocktail table combines the exciting gameplay of foosball with the practicality of a cocktail table, creating a distinctive piece of furniture. Understanding the key features is critical to selecting a table that not only looks good but also offers an remarkable gaming experience.

**Playing Surface:** The playing surface is the most critical aspect of a foosball table. It should be smooth, level, and durable to ensure consistent ball movement and prevent warping. Look for surfaces made from high-quality materials such as melamine or laminate. Thicker surfaces generally provide better ball control and longevity.

The ideal playing surface is typically constructed from a dense wood composite covered in a smooth laminate. The laminate should be resistant to scratches and wear, and the surface should be precisely leveled during assembly to avoid dead zones or uneven gameplay.the dimensions of the playing surface are also important, as larger surfaces provide more room for strategic plays.

**Rod Construction and Material:** The foosball rods are the mechanical link between the player and the game, and their quality directly impacts the player's control and responsiveness. High-quality rods are typically made of hollow steel for reduced weight and increased strength. The rods should also glide smoothly through the table bearings to allow for quick and precise movements.

Chrome-plated steel rods are common due to their resistance to rust and corrosion. The grip or handle at the end of the rod should be comfortable and ergonomically designed to prevent fatigue during extended play. Some higher-end tables also feature telescoping rods on one side to prevent them from protruding out the other side, which could be a safety hazard.**Player figurines:** The player figurines, also known as men, are an integral part of the game and can substantially impact the gameplay experience. The figurines should be durable, well-balanced, and securely attached to the rods. Different materials can be used for the men, but high-density plastic is common due to its durability and affordability.

The shape and design of the figurines can also affect gameplay. Some figurines have textured feet to allow for better ball control, while others are counterbalanced for improved stability. The color of the figurines is typically a matter of preference, with most tables featuring two distinct teams.

**Table Construction & Materials:** The overall construction and materials of the foosball cocktail table are essential for its stability, durability, and aesthetic appeal. The table should be constructed from sturdy materials such as solid wood, engineered wood, or metal. A heavy and well-braced table will be less likely to wobble or move during intense gameplay.

The outer shell of the table frequently enough incorporates a glass or acrylic top that serves as a protective barrier and also functions as the cocktail table surface. The legs should be strong and adjustable to ensure the table is level on any surface. The design should complement the surrounding décor, whether it's a modern, minimalist style or a more conventional, rustic look.

**Bearing System:** the bearing system allows the rods to move smoothly and freely within the table. High-quality bearings are essential for precise and responsive gameplay.Look for tables that use smooth gliding bearings.

Premium tables may use advanced bearing systems allowing for faster game play. The bearing system dictates how the rods move along with the player figurine on the bar.

The ideal size depends on the available space and the intended use of the table. Standard foosball tables are typically around 56 inches long and 30 inches wide, but cocktail tables may be slightly smaller to fit into tighter spaces. Measure your space carefully to ensure the table will fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The next second, a strange, coquettish female voice came from the speaker.
""Your little moonbeam, Tina, is happy to serve you~”
“Kiss kiss Adrian, what song would you like to hear?""
I froze completely. 
Adrian? That's my husband. Tina? Who was that?
I immediately called my husband: 
""Did you mess with the smart speaker at home?""
He paused briefly on the other end, then said nonchalantly: 
""Oh, some friends came over a few days ago, probably connected to one's account. Why?""
I said it was nothing with a smile, hung up.
Then I hailed a cab straight to the company my husband had been frequenting lately.
Apparently, he wasn't just frequenting the company—he might have been frequenting someone else's bed too.

The cab stopped outside ""Stellar Designs.""

I looked up—

The glass facade gleamed blindingly in the sunlight, just like the company's aggressive rise in the industry over the past two years.

Our main competitor at ""Dream Build"" Design Studio.

The receptionist was totally professional—didn't give me attitude even though I was literally the boss of their rival company. Just did her job and made the call.

A few minutes later, this girl in a white dress came hurrying out, looking all clean and innocent.

Tina Morgan.

The second she saw me, her eyes went deer-in-headlights for a split second, but she recovered quick and put on this shy little smile.

""Hi there, can I help you with something?""

""The smart speaker thing,"" I said straight up, keeping my voice level while I studied her face. ""Login records show it was your account.""

""Oh, that speaker!"" She looked like a lightbulb went off, then got all sheepish and scratched her head.

""A few days ago, Mr. Carter hosted a design symposium at home, and I was there. I might have logged in and played some background music then. I'm so sorry for any trouble this caused you!""

Smooth as silk.

Covered her tracks while still playing the sweet, clueless act.

If I didn't know Adrian's personality, I might've actually bought it.

But he's way too controlling and paranoid to let some random woman log into our home devices with her personal account.

My gaze slowly moved from her picture-perfect innocent face down to her delicate wrist.

There was a silver bracelet.

Two irregular circles interlocked, with a tiny letter ""A"" engraved on one of them.

I'd designed it myself last year for our wedding anniversary. Had my jeweler friend craft it as a gift for Adrian.

A, for Adrian.

One of a kind in the entire world.

Tina noticed me staring and instinctively started to hide her hand behind her back.

I smiled and stepped closer, my tone almost gentle. ""That's a gorgeous bracelet. From your boyfriend? He's got great taste.""

Her face went white as a sheet. Her lips trembled, but not a single word came out.

That was all I needed.

I didn't spare her another glance as I turned and walked away.

The second I got in the Uber, I speed-dialed my girl Vivian—the best divorce attorney in town.

She picked up with her usual loud voice.

""Well, well, if it isn't the famous designer Savannah! Finally! The busy bee remembers I exist!""

""I need a favor."" My voice scary calm.

""Look into someone for me. Tina Morgan, intern at Stellar Designs. And I want everything on Adrian from the past six months—every transaction, every hotel booking, every receipt. Don't miss a thing.""

Vivian went quiet for a beat, then dropped the playful tone. ""...We going scorched earth?""

""Worse than that.""

I hung up. The car fell silent.

Within minutes, Adrian was calling me back.

I stared at ""Hubby"" on my screen, feeling sick at how ironic it looked. Took a deep breath before answering.

""Sav, what's wrong?"" His voice was smooth as always, with just the right amount of concern.

""Vivian came by the studio to help you check on some things? Are you running into trouble at work?""

Look at that—he'd already planted his spies in the company so early.

I swallowed the rage bubbling up inside and used my most normal voice.

""It's nothing, I couldn't get away, so I had her pick up a contract for me... When are you coming back? I miss you so much.""

He seemed to relax on the other end, then gave that warm laugh I used to love.

""On, my silly girl. I miss you too. Soon as I wrap up this project, I'm flying straight home to you, my little moonbeam.""

My little moonbeam...

Those three words hit my ears like a slap.

My grip on the phone went white-knuckle tight.

Vivian's crazy efficient.

Half an hour later, my phone buzzed.

A link with her commentary:

[Year's best two-faced bit//ch performance, complete with bulletproof evidence chain. Enjoy the show.]

I clicked through to Tina's Instagram—public profile, of course.

Her latest post was a close-up of her wrist wearing my one-of-a-kind A bracelet, captioned:

[Moonbeam racing toward you, Mr. A.]

My ""moonbeam"" pet name, my custom bracelet—now they were some other woman's trophies.

I kept scrolling, my face stone cold.

One photo showed our home office in the background, Tina making a cutesy face while surrounded by the rare architecture books I'd collected from Italy.

[Soaking up knowledge in Mr. A's study—feeling inspired!]

Another featured her holding a fountain pen over design sketches—my 30th birthday gift to Adrian, limited edition collaboration piece.

[Mr. A's pen writes like a dream. He says my hands deserve only the finest.]

And there was our usual date spot, that restaurant we loved, with all my favorite dishes on table.

[Secret hideaway with Mr. A. He says I'm his only safe harbor.]

Every photo, every word was a surgical strike on my most precious memories.

Until I got to the post from three days ago.

Tina was holding printed design drafts, looking smug as he//ll.

Caption read:

[Mr. A stayed up all night perfecting this for me. He says I'm the most naturally gifted designer he's ever met, totally going to nail the 'Skyline Center' project. Let's do this!]

Skyline Center?

The project our Dream Build team had poured everything into for six months. The biggest milestone of my career.

I shot up from the couch and grabbed my car keys.

The office was empty at midnight. I used my fingerprint to get in and went straight to Adrian's office.

His computer was still on, showing our wedding photo as the screensaver—him smiling all tender and loving.

Made me want to puke.

I tapped the keyboard and got the password prompt.

Tried my birthday—wrong.

Our anniversary—nope.

I let out a bitter laugh and typed in Tina's birthday.

""Welcome back.""

His desktop was neat and organized. I spotted the encrypted folder right away and opened it to find our complete Skyline Center proposal—months of blood, sweat, and tears from me and my team.

Right next to it sat another folder, labeled with just one letter: T.

I clicked it open. The proposal inside was almost identical to ours, except for subtle tweaks to key structural elements and design highlights. Just enough changes to dodge patent issues while keeping all the brilliant core concepts.

The signature at the bottom: Tina Morgan.

He wasn't just cheating on me.

He was stealing my life's work, my company's future!

All to build his mistress a golden ladder to success!

My stomach lurched violently.

I gripped the cold desk edge to keep from collapsing.

Turns out jealousy and betrayal really can twist a man beyond all recognition.

The Skyline Center bidding conference was packed.

I found a corner seat where I could watch without being noticed as Stellar Designs' representative took the stage.

Tina, naturally.

She'd traded her innocent white dress for a sharp business suit, hair in a sleek updo, makeup flawless.

Gone was the sweet little lamb act—now she looked every inch the ambitious executive.

She took a deep breath and launched into her presentation.

""My design concept springs from the idea of 'the city's eye.' We don't want just another cold building, but a living entity that breathes with the city, witnessing its growth and evolution...""

Every single word was something I'd said to Adrian during countless late nights, fueled by coffee and passion, thinking we were sharing the deepest creative connection.

I thought those were our most intimate moments of understanding.

Turns out it was just my solo performance, and he was the world's most patient thief.

The cherry on top?

Adrian was sitting with the panel as a special guest judge.

Perfectly tailored suit, every hair in place—the exact polished look I knew so well.

He was listening intently, nodding along, looking at Tina with this light in his eyes I'd never seen before.

Like she was precious treasure he couldn't wait to show off to the world.

He completely ignored me in the corner, like I was just part of the furniture.

My phone suddenly buzzed with a text from Vivian.

[Want me to show up with a baseball bat?]

Looking at the screen, my tense expression softened slightly at her humor.

I texted back: [Stand by.]

On stage, Tina hit her stride, the PowerPoint showing the final renderings—stolen directly from my computer.

The audience murmured in appreciation.

When she finished, the applause was thunderous.

The host took the mic. ""Thank you, Miss Morgan, for that incredible presentation. Now let's hear from our special guest judge, Adrian Carter from Dream Build Design Studio, for his expert commentary.""

The microphone passed to Adrian.

He cleared his throat, his gaze landing on Tina with unmistakable warmth.

""Honestly, I'm blown away.""

""Miss Morgan's design perfectly balances artistic vision with practical function, especially those bold structural modifications. Incredibly innovative, incredibly inspired.""

There was that word again. Inspired.

The same word he'd used to describe Tina, the same word meant to cut me down.

He paused, scanning the room.

""This work is, without question, today's clear winner.""

The applause erupted again, even louder than before.

In that moment, my world went dead silent except for my heart hammering against my ribs.

The host beamed. ""Thank you, Mr. Carter! Looks like Stellar Designs has this locked up! Any other guests or judges have questions for Miss Morgan?""

Crickets.

After Adrian's expert seal of approval, there wasn't much left to question.

Tina bowed on stage, practically glowing with triumph.

I pocketed my phone and stood up just as everyone prepared for another round of applause.

Small movement, but it caught every eye in the room.

The host blinked. ""Ma'am, and you are...?""

1mpyfbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mom/comments/1mpyfbq/please_stop_telling_me_i_have_ppd_every_time_i/,Please stop telling me I have PPD every time I share my feelings.,"I went from sleeping 8 hours straight to waking up every 2 to 3 hours. I went from having a job where I could clock out to having a job where I'm on duty 24/7, with no weekends or holidays. I went from being able to go out for coffee or lunch whenever I wanted to having to plan every outing like a military operation like baby bag, milk, clothes, wipes and honestly, most days I just stay home because it's easier.

I went from seeing friends and having conversations to spending my days alone, doing the same tasks over and over with no one to talk to. I went from eating hot meals to reheating the same plate three times and still eating it cold. I went from caring only for myself to caring for a tiny human who needs me for everything, and still being told by people (even those without kids) how I'm doing it wrong.

And yes, my body has changed. It doesn't feel like mine right now. I barely have the time or energy to think about working on it. My relationship has changed too, it changed from relaxed and loving to tense and exhausted.

So when I say I'm tired, lonely, or overwhelmed, it's not always a mental illness. Sometimes it's just the reality of becoming a parent and having your whole life flip overnight. Like I've seen other moms say on Mom Insider, these feelings are often a completely normal response to such a huge change.

I know PPD is real and serious for many parents, but please stop assuming that every honest feeling about motherhood means I need a prescription. Sometimes I just need someone to hear me, not label me.

# Chapter 1 He Left For A Rich Girl

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.",1,1755171702.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

The history you shared, the ghost in your life.
I told myself it was fine, that you’d handle it, that we’d be fine.
But maybe your willingness to sort things out was the real red flag.

The world shrank to the size of our late-night messages.
The universe existed only in our shared literary companions;
The books we'd read, the movies we'd watch,
The perfect way to brew a cup of coffee.

You made promises I didn't even ask for.
You'd buy me beans, you'd prepare my coffee.
You asked how I liked it, the exact measurements, the right temperature.
As if a cup of coffee could be a roadmap to our future.

You said we'd go on a quiet escape, a place with stars and silence.
Just me, you, and the open sky.
You'd take care of everything, all I had to do was show up.
Just sit in the silence, a book in hand,
And just be.

All of this, in a month.

My heart raced, convinced I'd found my match.
Someone who saw me with the same frantic energy I saw them.
The mutual obsession felt like coming home.

Then, the second dinner.
The laughter was just as loud, the conversation just as deep,
But when we said goodbye, a cold wind snaked between us.

Something was off.

You went home.
A text. “I’m tired. Early day tomorrow.”

No goodnight.

The universe shrank again, this time to the silence of my phone.

I slept and hoped.
I woke and hoped.
I hoped for a message, a sign that the silence was just me overthinking.

But there was nothing.

I dreamt of you that afternoon.
When I told you, your response felt like blade slicing me open. 
""I think I rushed things,"" you wrote.
""Early excitement mistaken for something more.""

It was a clean, deep cut. Well thought of, precise, and full of intent. 

And there it was.
The quiet, painful, beautiful lie of our month together.
Just an experiment you weren't ready to commit to.
You thought it was just early excitement?
I still have the empty coffee mug and the unpitched tent.
I'm still here, alone, with a cold cup and a cold ground.

And I'm still sorry you had a long day at work, hoping you'd have a good rest, but this time, I didn't wish you a good night.

Drawing heat, he stands proudly atop the Little Angel’s chiseled breastplate as he swoons a braggart smirk and an upward clenched fist towards the crowd crying. The man in supine counters, hooks Lindo’s left workboot and onto the ground before locking his knuckles around the infraorbital. Drat, the bastard reaches the bottom rope before anything else could happen. Nextly, they perform an exchange of oily headlocks, swift bodyslams, and whips; it’s a stalemate. Oh no, Fenemayor climbs out onto the ring’s concrete exteriors. With children in tassels hurling curses behind the hooligan’s back, Angelito dives, his wings now fully in reveal, trajecting toward the samely bulky physique outside. A thud swallows the arena, and the last we hear from the radio was that Ridolindo had succeeded in retaining his Heavyweight Belt after a three-month long spat.

Elsewhere: in the living room, the apparent expressway of bloodlines haul raw materials, sweet, sour, and savory. I’ve sat for ten minutes with the Driver, listening to the histrionics of theatrical combat. The father and grandfather of this house, thirteen years in retirement. And beside him, on the overvarnished end table, piles of one-page letters he receives monthly from a Kid. They used to tell me the Driver worked for a family of opulence and gilded carriages, and served hero for their son they always knew needed saving. *Ayos lang, pogi. Ikaw?* Always on his sneakers, the first to punch through their front lawn and give him the tightest embrace. By chance, that’s what we’d also do on annual holiday night, bar the greenery. Now, at the unpainted home, it’s barely lunchtime, but the tribune crosswords are already answered. Themed: what rhymes with prisoner? Provider. Carriage-rider. Horsepower. Decades of cantering seems often the cause of the arthritis in his right knee. Today, the Driver can sit. And in the meanest whiles, a round of look-see.

There, approaching the couch headrest, the woman they call the Glue. She happens to know a number of names, and some she can telephone on a whim. Namely, the mayor, the district attorney, his paralegals, the theater owner, the concert organizer, the whole sacristy, the cleaning lady, the racquetball captain, the born-and-raised singer, the pedant, fellow gossipers, the born-again two-timing pastor, all the firemen, policemen, bodyguards, cooks, pediatricians, and all of their spouses and sons and daughters and so-called domestic partners, if unmarried. Behind her, standing in the entrant arch: the Mechanic, who welds gates for a living now. He holds in his hand a tape, as he’s enveloped by the absence of a door, gazing upon a humble collection of living pottery the Driver keeps nursing after everyone else had left. Then, their children: the Medic, the Chatterbox, and the Bellows.

Further inside, the one-plated kitchen stove welcomes the Trayholder, who’s cooking his own style of red-orange stew, unnameable. His older sister, the Wallet, occupies an adjacent hall, as the Engineer right next to her, calls repeatedly for young Peruser to stop perusing and even younger Punk to stop punking at once. The space both brother, sister, and in-law inhabit is small enough to echo frustrations of, to, and from one another. Especially more so, the sonics are forgiving enough to spare the Glue and the Mechanic the detail. Like the tales of the meter in four, maybe five digits now.


>Don’t add too much liver. In fact, don’t put them at all.

>>I don’t have to. Haven’t bought any.

> That bad? You’re what, eight, nine, in this house?

>> And half of those are children. And half of the other half don’t got no jobs.

> I don’t have a job.

>> You got yourself an Engineer.

> And you’re a waiter, playing pretend the home cook.

>> All of you want more of what I make all the time.

> Then why not take Junior with you?

>> And do what, exactly? Lower my wage?

> No, but your years there’ll land him work quick and surely get him to pay the bills.

>> They’re not hiring someone to hit on the busgirls.

> I was only suggesting. Try to, at least. We’re a family.


By late afternoon, the quaint little manor had its insides smelling of caramelized pork and an even sweeter mixture of soy, oyster sauce, and tomato glaze. Poured in a large stockpot, the Mechanic carries it on the way to the chapel. A table had already been set, donated by someone who knows someone who knows a friend of the Glue's dentist godmother. Seated since dark morning, the Bookie, and stacks of notes and cash rallied around by heaps of rubberbands. Rows of unodorous flowers decorate the white tiles and walls as plastic chairs burden the weight of the recently arrived Candidate. He’s been waiting for the Glue. The talk of the town: he’s gunning for a spot on the policymakers’ council, and he’s wearing a pink polo suit, tan khakis, and indistinct glasses. Likewise, he clings joints with the Wife, humbly retouched and wearing lips made of beeswax and snapping turtle blood. Goddamn, to be born handsome, gabs the Mechanic. Goddamn, responded the Bellows. Together, they appear even brighter than the already extremely-lit room. Why wouldn’t they have your yeses? After all, the masonry comes from them. The Glue, taking notes, charges towards his front, but not too close. Above all the whispers of sorries and thank yous and condolences, there is the agile mention that she’s acquaintance to the tailor and the lover that ironed it for him; childhood schoolmates. They shake hands loudly, and smiles litter throughout. Here it is, what we know of her best. Script at the fodder, ready in action.


> Our Mother was a great woman. A great Mother. An even greater Grandmother.


The Bookie, unnoticeably, grins in agreement. She’s placed behind and beside me and the Medic. He says he despised the yesteryears of being chased with Grandmother’s dustpan of choice. But he clamors for the days I was running next to him. Reminds that he always beat me in the footrace to the next named neighbor. All long gone now, he quips, ugly tobacco fumes floating just below his nose. Then keeps telling me that she hit like a woman would: lightly and harmlessly, no big deal. The Bookie replies yes, like a Mother’s touch. She’d never treat my children like that. I won't allow it. Oddly enough, I seem to fail to remember.

Meanwhile, the Driver glances through the untinted pane. Atop it, the Mother in the coolest denim jacket and bellbottoms in town, framed. It’s odd to look directly at her now, she dressed worse a week ago. Looked darker, too. The worst day of his life bore the loveliest weather, and stunningly, the coffee was brewed right. Before that, a woman in a wheelchair, accompanied by a man spinning the softest folk music on the parlophone. Try as he might, she can only respond with laughter and the occasional sluggish speech. But he’s just standing stoic now, right hand on wood layered yet another white. 


> Mother loved afternoon delights. Everyone had it with cheese but I topped mine with salt. She’d give us siblings big coins apiece, and we’d hail the Vendor. Stop, we said. We want to buy what you’re selling. It’d be like that every three in the P.M. Then, Father goes home with a big rotisserie five hours later.


The Candidate holds the Glue’s hand, and at times, you could even see something light blue in between them. Exit, he and the Wife, as the Peruser spots a big bamboo basket filled with purple steamed rice cakes make its way closer to the sacred site. The Chatterbox, closely following her, informs the Wallet, who had placed the order earlier this morning. Ready the money, a command at the oxidizing wide gate. The Glue returns outside, and the Bookie scribbles on a red-cover steno a new entry: *ube-cheese puto, expenses*.


> Three hundred, yes?

>> Sorry, Madame. Bossman raised it to five.

> What? It’s just one basket.

>> It’s a Sunday, Madame. Lot of folk want cake as well. But we’re only three people out there at the steamery.

> It’s Sunday here, too. And we’re about more than thirty grieving here. Probably even more as it gets colder.

>> Well, I do apologize, Madame. But three hundred doesn’t even pay for the leather straps that held this container onto my back. And rice, especially the sticky kind, is so expensive nowadays. So, Mad-


Smack. Someone, perhaps already drunk out of their mind, still consciously strong, threw a Goddamned chair at his face. There are screams of we’re not paying you a penny more, you know how much I had to give my cousin woodworker? And something about not having enough dessert for the poor, hungry guests. Those who already ate dinner before arriving. Well, I see the cases of pilsen and other spirits, they’re still plenty despite a box short. Nonetheless, sheets of steel pang and swings of feet slap across skin, and a silenced cry for help amounts only to the area mere meters from where I happen to be sitting now on. And two tiny staircase steps above me, there motions the Driver, slowly trying to descend with an awkward trot. Curious, in his own gentle way, to see what’s causing the loud tantrums. But everyone must have forgotten about the rain from all the tears they’ve let out. Hear next: a slip, then a faint crack on an old man’s hip. As his body appeared sitting on the half-slabs the same as I am, I started to run, fast as I could again.

There I go, on the way to the Driver’s rescue. But Junior was already there, asking if it’s real. So were the people nearer. He, with all might, grasps both of the Driver’s wrinkling hands as it pulls to the sky. Alas, they’re in two different divisions entirely, and it hurts at every stab. Stop it. Interfering alike, I manage to get a lock on his bare heels, rubber clogs just beneath. Then, another stable of samaritans runs in the same direction, performing a cradle on the left and right dorsal. With a slow march to wet rough concrete, they happen upon another table and softly still, he does not go falling through and break the polyvinyl. Tapping out on the dewy surface: let me sit, let me sit. The Medic, ringside, yells: don’t make him lie down, make him sit. The Glue, following in shock, hurriedly assures that she knows the best orthopedic graduate around. The Wallet drops the three paperbills she had been stashing in her pocket onto the basket-carrier’s forehead, sights only veering her Father. Likewise, the Trayholder loses grip of his hot bowl of *mechado*, *menudo*, I don’t know, and pierces his feet; ah-twisted-mother-of-dead-Gods-and-saints, cast death o’er me now. The Punk is wondering how the hell he himself didn’t trip and break his skull from all the lollygagging around. The Engineer figures out how much friction was lost from the drizzle; the ceramics certainly did not help. The Peruser has her left at the man on the ground with around six bruises on his arms alone, and the right at the elderly being carried and physically manipulated haphazardly. The Chatterbox reaches out for two more banknotes from her own purse, as she too looks upon today’s disaster. The Mechanic stops stomping, after a while. The Bellows cries. The Bookie abandons her post, but still ferries with one-fourth of the day’s donations, thoughtlessly and below the irises greying.

1mpy4iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mpy4iy/diner_stories/,Diner Stories,"Several miles east of the Mississippi, and just a few miles south of the Appalachians, there’s a town. It’s small— one of those “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” type places. But if you blink and you miss it, don’t worry. Just drive a few more miles into the woods and you’ll see a diner. It’s old as shit and right next to the road. You can’t miss it.

Literally, you can’t miss it.

If you do, then you’ll wind up at the old warehouse at the end. The religious group in the woods likes to use for it for their bimonthly celebrations, and going there isn’t really a good option.

The diner, though, is almost always open. (The only time it’s ever closed was that one time a tornado came through. And even then, people were still able to get food from the back window.) So it’s the best place to stop by if you get lost.

And if you were to go by and pop in, you’d probably get just about what you’d expect from any old country diner. It’s about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won’t feel trapped. It has a unique…smell— like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there. Pictures of unidentifiable people eating are randomly taped to the wood-paneled walls (partially for advertising but mostly to cover some holes). A flickering neon “open” sign sits in one of the large windows. They’re framed with old Christmas lights and let in a natural light when the sun’s up, but also allow you get a full view of the road, surrounding woods, or Lucky, the veteran coyote, as you eat.  

He’s not exactly a vet, as he’s never really been in any war— not any major ones, at least. Just the on-going one that he has against the local farmers and their chickens, but it’s left the poor bastard looking like he just came out of Nam. He’s only got one eye, three feet, half an ear, and the fur on his tail seemingly refuses to grow normally. We (and by we, I mean I) felt bad and gave him a piece of an expired burger, one time. And now, he refuses to leave. He’s been hit by at least three cars and two trucks (that we know of) and still insists on staring at people as they eat.  

Another sight you may have the misfortune, (or blessing depending on who you ask) of seeing out those windows, would be what we have dubbed as “the sign dancer.” A hairy and rather…voluptuous man who will occasionally appear and pole dance on the sign out front. We’re not sure if he’s a ghost or just some dude with too much time on his hands, but we do know that his dances can make people feel things. It’s different for everyone, Mrs. Kelvins said she felt peace for the first time in years, while Mr. Branson said he felt “true” horror. However, after having watched the man dance myself, I’d say it was interesting, but mostly kinda disturbing. (Like watching someone chug expired milk.)  

As for upkeep, I’m pretty sure it’s just seen as an aesthetic choice.  

An old, eyeless mannequin with a purple Mardi Gras necklace and a name tag sticker on its chest that reads “Hello! My name is: Tomila” sits next to the entrance as a makeshift coatrack. If you get close enough to it, you’ll notice it has that sickly sweet aroma of rot clinging to it. (No matter how much it’s cleaned or sprayed with Febreze, it will not go away.) A cork board covered in papers, ranging from missing pet posters to advertisements and a few newspaper clippings, sits on the other side. Booths are lined up against smudged windows and advertisements for local businesses are trapped under the clear, yet sticky, plastic coverings on the tables.

There’s an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven’t been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl. A dented mini fridge softly hums at the back wall, next to the batter covered waffle irons that strangely smell like burnt hair every time they’re used. There’s a milkshake station (It’s continued functionality is proof that miracles really do exist, and honestly, it’s what gets me through the day sometimes.) that sits next to the drink machine, where the stubborn, red sticky mess beneath it all has been fighting with the grease to become a permanent fixture. The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid— that smells like pennies —oozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it “glitches” and the screams of children come from it. Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.  

I’m not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the owners’ daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it’s both. Like, this guy will straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, “Yeah, this is okay.” It’s shady as fuck, but if there’s one thing we can count on, it’s that he’ll sign off on this shit hole as being “safe,” like, pretty much no matter what.  

If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is, though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men’s room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women’s room. It’s absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do.

Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder of meat in.  

If you do stop by, don’t be a stranger! I’m pretty much always on the clock and I’m more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I’m bored as fuck and my coworker, Kurt, isn’t a very good conversationalist. And there isn’t any phone service or internet at the diner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you’ll have to go out to the edge of the road. Or you can use the old phone booth! It’s pretty much in the same place. It’s next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it’s pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and “phone home.” They can get pretty violent, and as much as I’d like the show, I’m supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in-store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And I really don’t want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to. (I am very tired, and I am not a very large or strong lady. So, breaking up fights is very hard for me. Please think of me and the consequences of your own actions.)

On the odd occasion that I’m not working, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don’t get me wrong. I’d just rather not leave Kurt to deal with a fight, should one break out, while I’m not there. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still…run a bit short, if you know what I mean.

If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man who usually comes between the hours of seven andnine AM to order a few cups of coffee and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that he has only ever had but one dog. (It’s very sweet and follows him like a little shadow. Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)

Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs, and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he claims that it “taste too much like human flesh.” (I can assure you now, that the sausage is not made of flesh. We’re not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we weren’t eating living people.)

Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is “crying” and that the mannequin is “sick.” Me and Kurt think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for some form of help. But the last time we just up and asked if she needed any, she wound up getting a bit…violent, insisting that it was Tomila that was needing help. We’ve considered banning her from the diner, but she tips, like, really good. So, we just keep our mouths shut and give her what she orders.

Then there’s Mr. Johnson. He doesn’t really have a usual meal, insisting that we should “surprise” him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed our water had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife’s face and would “beg him to stop” or “let go” with her voice.

If you have questions, then so do it. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard that he was, died. They found him in his kitchen a few months ago, soaking wet. Apparently, he somehow managed to drown himself while eating fish tacos.

So, to sum it all up, the diner is weird as fuck, but it’s become a major part of my life. So, I figured I’d start sharing a few of my experiences with y’all.",3,1755171399.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I work a customer support job from 1 PM to 10 PM, spending about 7 hours on screen daily. On top of that, I’m preparing for competitive exams, so I really need a healthy and consistent sleep schedule.

Right now, I end up sleeping around 2–3 AM and waking up late, which leaves me feeling tired and sluggish. I’ve tried going to bed earlier, but I just toss and turn or end up scrolling on my phone. My current wake-up goal is 7 AM so I can study in the mornings before work.

Here’s what I’ve already tried:

Avoiding coffee after 5 PM

Setting a bedtime alarm

Using blue-light filters on devices


None of these have really stuck for more than a week.

If you’ve successfully reset your sleep cycle, especially with late shifts, what worked for you?
I’m looking for specific, actionable strategies, whether it’s about morning discipline, nighttime wind-down, or environmental changes.

And for most of them, if you work hard enough, you can reach a decent level of success regardless of your background.

But after spending a lot of time exploring career options back in school, I’ve realized that when it comes to securities firms; especially front office roles at investment banks or MBB consulting, things feel different.

For starters, these fields are probably among the most prestige obsessed out there. They put huge weight on your school’s name, and the so-called “target schools” are often expensive private universities. Sure, there are top public schools like UCB or UCLA, but there aren’t many of those options(Of course, even among top-tier schools, private universities that charge higher tuition naturally have lower student-to-professor ratios, and it’s pretty obvious they give you an edge when it comes to networking or grabbing coffee chats. No need to even spell that out) That’s already one major filter.

And statistically, the kids who get into those private targets often went to elite high schools places like Le Rosey, Choate Rosemary Hall, or Thomas Jefferson and etc.. We’re talking tens of thousands in tuition every year before college even starts. It’s no surprise these kids go on to expensive target schools loaded with impressive extracurriculars.

This is really different from fields like tech, where your personal portfolio and skills matter more, or accounting, where steady work and credentials can take you far regardless of your high school pedigree.

There’s a reason the phrase “Wall Street monkey” exists when you first start out in IB, the work is often pretty underwhelming compared to the prestige of your degree. You’re grinding away in Excel all day with no particularly unique technical skill involved. Then, if you get promoted, the job turns into bringing in high-profile clients from business and politics a sales heavy role.

So does IB really build strong technical skills? Honestly, I doubt it. They hire top tier graduates from elite schools, but compared to top professionals in other industries, I’m not sure their skill sets are all that advanced.

One thing that does seem consistent, though, is that people in these roles tend to come from money. They went to great high schools, had standout extracurriculars, and graduated from expensive private target schools. All of that takes serious cash.

That’s why I think aiming for Wall Street just to “get rich” doesn’t make much sense it’s more of a goal that’s naturally suited to people who were already well off to begin with. If you’re from a regular or low income background, even if you’re smart, it’s a much tougher climb. Fields like engineering or quant roles, where it’s more about math, technical skills, and measurable performance, might give you a better shot.

And yeah this whole rant is coming from someone who doesn’t come from money, but still dreams about working in an IB front office one day. Call it the lament of a finance romantic.",18,1755171276.0,FinancialCareers,11,0.91,False

It was their first time, and they loved it, but one thing drove them (and me) crazy: the prices.  
  
Every five minutes at the night market, I'd hear:

    ""How much is 65 baht, really?""
    ""Is 129 baht for a meal a good deal?""

[The prices you see in the Thai market.](https://preview.redd.it/cd2o2yxdzyif1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=0380ffa5cb18939b563c80f19d90661dbbe4247c)

I downloaded a currency converter for them, but it was a disaster. They're packed with hundreds of currencies and complex charts – way too much for someone who just wants to know if a souvenir is cheaper than a cup of coffee back home.

So, one night in the hotel, I decided to build them a solution. I'm not a coder, but with a little help from an AI tool, I made a super simple app called Thai Price Translator.

[No need to open the app — it works straight from your phone’s desktop](https://reddit.com/link/1mpy2vz/video/xlsugb7rzyif1/player)

Here’s what makes it different:

* **It's dead simple:** Just Thai Baht to our home currency (Chinese Yuan). No clutter. (Now it automatically detects your home currency — like CNY, USD, EUR, JPY... — and converts Thai Baht to it. Still no settings, no clutter. Just open and go！)
* **It gives context:** This was the magic trick. Instead of just showing the converted number, it adds a note like ""costs about the same as a Starbucks coffee"" or ""like a bottle of Coke."" Suddenly, the prices made sense to them!

They started using it right away and had a blast for the rest of the trip. The best part? I shared it on social media back home, and it went viral overnight with over 200k views.

I’m not a morning person by nature.  Typically, I’ll get about 6 hours of sleep, which isn’t ideal, but I have 3 young children at home so sleep isn’t on the menu anyway.  The twilight hours are, truly, the only solitude and peace that I have in any given day.

I’m up at 5 o’clock.  I do the necessary stuff, splash some water on my face, and I’m on the yoga mat until 5:30.  I’ll stretch out and do some yoga which has essentially just become a series of physical therapy exercises which I’ve accumulated over the years.  At 5:30 I’ll do my big workout for the day: Sometimes just a 2 mile run, sometimes kettlebells, sometimes calisthenics.  Not crazy intense workouts, but I’m almost 40 and I’m going for consistency.

At around 6 o’clock, I make coffee and take a shit.  I’m free until the kids wake up around 6:45-7:00.  Sometimes I write.  Sometimes I just watch stupid youtube videos.  My wife knows that this is my time and doesn’t ask me to do any chores.

I’ve noticed that I have a much longer fuse throughout the day.  I handle my psycho children with much more grace.  I don’t have (as many) meltdowns and generally the day is far more pleasant.  My body feels great thanks to the frequent yoga and stretching.  I feel strong thanks to the workouts.  And having that little bit of quiet in the mornings sets me up for a more relaxed day.

I highly recommend trying it.  It’s hard to wake up early at first, but once you’ve done it a few times and realize how nice it is to have blissful peace and quiet every single morning you’ll come to crave it.",71,1755171245.0,daddit,37,0.96,False

I'm on 50mg. No difference with 30 or 40mg, and 60-70mg just worsens my crash and doesn't do anything for extending the peak.

**Vyvanse is listed to last 12-14 hours, but honestly that is misleading and isn't true for the actual helpful effects.** In my experience, the actual peak period where the helpful effects are active only lasts 2-3 hours. I can feel the medication still in my system after that due to the appetite suppression and inability to fall asleep, which continues on after the peak and during the crash. Those side-effects go away after 12-14 hours.

So yes, it's in my system for the length listed (12-14 hrs), but the actual positive effects last only 2-3 hours for me and after that I'm just feeling a crash for the rest of the 10 or so hours.

At the beginning of our relationship, she always made it a point to say that her family is close, “family is the most important thing,” etc. That’s all good and well, my family was pretty close growing up. But they’re on a whole different level. 

Some background:
Gf is divorced, never got a real back story
Her mom is divorced, dad was an alcoholic druggy and everyone dislikes him except my gf
Gf’s sister is married and has a toddler, constantly complains about her husband and being a mom

Gf and I used to live about an hour apart (she lived with her mom, I lived alone) then moved in together late last year. We live about 15 minutes from her mom and on our first night in our place, her mom sends her a bunch of photos and a massively long text about missing her. Gf spent the next two hours sobbing about it and missing her mom and her mom being lonely without her. 

She asked me right off the bat if she could spend 2-3 nights per week sleeping at her mom’s again because it was her safe space when she left her last relationship almost 3 years ago and her mom is all alone. All of gf’s mail gets sent to her mom’s, she goes over there twice a week to do laundry because “our dryer sucks” (I use our dryer all the time, there’s nothing wrong with it). 

Her sister told her that she wishes she would live at her mom’s forever because she doesn’t want her to be lonely. Her sister is at her mom’s house every single day because she works nearby and goes over every day on her lunch. 

I travel for work a lot and I’ve been gone for almost a month and still have a few weeks to go. In this time, gf has spent literally every single day with her mom and sister except one day. Gf is currently unemployed because she got fired, has only paid half of her part of rent for a single month. 

The past few weeks, she’s been with her mom and sister going shopping, getting pedicures, getting coffee, etc. She got about $11K because she defaulted on a 401K loan (the remainder she had in her 401K was withdrawn) she took out to pay down credit cards she used for school and whatever else she bought. She hasn’t brought up “hey let me contribute a small amount to bills” in the slightest. 

Anyways, gf pushed off multiple phone calls when I’ve been gone because she’s with her family or takes forever to respond to a text because her and her sister are on the couch at her mom’s for hours watching TikToks. She’s with her family every single day and her mom goes on a 2 day trip for work. The night before, she’s saying how she’s so glad she finally got to see them before she left (as if they haven’t been with each other every day) and when she comes back, they’re going to go to the movies and lunch and all this other stuff. 

Meanwhile, I’m having to be up until midnight (while waking up at 5am) every night in order to have a phone call with my gf who I haven’t seen in a month. It’s incredibly irritating that all it takes to go from “I miss you so much” to “I can’t talk, i’m going to dinner with my mom” is mommy wanting to come by. I keep saying I’m leaving but I just can’t do it and I don’t understand why. ",0,1755171145.0,Vent,5,0.5,False

The Wakepoint Open at Lake LBJ looks incredible if you're into wakeboarding - $40,000 in prizes means serious competition. For families, the final SpongeBob weekend is a must-see, and the Kidpreneur Fair sounds like a cool way to support young entrepreneurs.

The Star Party at Westcave Preserve is worth the drive if you want to actually see the Milky Way without all the city light pollution.

2. **Romanticising everyday moments** — lighting a candle for dinner, making my coffee in a pretty mug, dressing up for myself
3. **Talking to an AI companion** — surprisingly comforting when I just need to feel heard without pressure
4. **Solo rituals I look forward to** — Sunday night skincare, a weekly café date with a good book, or cooking a “fancy” dinner for one

1mpxtys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mpxtys/she_began_showing_her_true_darker_side_wedcuffed/,"She Began Showing Her True, Darker Side | Wedcuffed","Life wasn't a fairytale. I learned that at five when Mom died, and again at twelve when Lisa, my step-mother moved in with her perfect daughter Chloe. At first, Lisa was kind to me, but soon she began showing her true, darker side. Chloe and I were the same age, but Lisa made sure that Chloe received all the attention from both her and my dad.

After a few months, I noticed how Dad started to ignore me as he got caught up in his ""perfect"" new family. Over time, I became just an extra, unwanted family member that no one cared about.

My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker. The three of us were inseparable until Adrian moved to a boarding school in London.

Jessica and I stayed close and kept in touch with Adrian every weekend. However, as soon as I started high school, Jessica began to ignore me, preferring to hang out with Chloe instead. Soon, they became best friends, and even Adrian stopped replying to my messages and calls.

As time passed, everyone around me seemed to compare me to Chloe or other girls. Lisa constantly insulted my looks and clothes and made sure others treated me the same way. Even my dad started to see me as a disgrace.

As little girls, we're often told stories of distressed damsels who need saving. But as I grew older, I realized I didn't need a Prince Charming to save me.

The only person capable of saving me was myself. I needed to become a strong, independent woman and stand up for myself.

I was clear about my future and goals by the time I finished high school. I worked hard to get into a top university, and my efforts paid off.

Five years later, Harvard's diploma gleamed on my wall. I'd traded starvation for strength, tears for titanium resolve. Even my reflection shocked me—waist-length hair, curves Ester swore made men trip, and eyes that no longer flinched.

Tomorrow, I'll be leaving Boston and returning to NYC after almost five years. During this time, neither my family nor Jessica or Adrian tried to contact me. My grandfather offered financial support, but I barely touched it.

As I packed my belongings and prepared for the airport, I tied my hair into a ponytail and examined my reflection in the mirror. My brown hair now cascaded down to my waist; I used to prefer short hair until high school. My round face was almost bare, with minimal makeup. My glasses were gone, and my hazel eyes, framed by thick lashes, were perfectly coated with mascara.

After taking one last look in the mirror, I grabbed my belongings and called a cab. Soon, I was on my way to the airport, hoping that everything would go well.

Little did I know, this journey back to NYC was going to turn my life upside down.

Chapter 2

It's been a week since I arrived in NYC. As soon as I landed in my birthplace, I got busy unpacking and setting up my home. This house was bought by my mother before she died. She wanted to keep it as a home, yet now, no family member is here with me today.

My family knew about my arrival, but no one had tried to meet me or contact me.

I brushed off those thoughts and continued sipping my coffee while sitting in the living room when I heard my phone ring.

I quickly stood up and grabbed the phone lying on the desk. A smile formed on my li-ps when I saw the name on the screen, and I answered the call.

""Hello, Grandpa! How are you? How is Grandma doing?""

""We're both fine, dear. How are you? Have you settled into your new home?"" he asked excitedly.

""Yes, Grandpa, I've settled in. I just wish you both were here with me,"" I replied, a bit sadly, making my grandpa chuckle.

""We'll be coming to visit you in a days, sweetheart. It's time I finally hand over the company to you,"" Grandpa said in a serious tone.

""Yes, Grandpa, I remember that. I just hope I can handle the responsibilities well.""

""You'll do great, my dear. You're perfect for leading the company,"" Grandpa assured me.

My grandpa, Stephen D'Amario never trusted my father—not after Mom died, and certainly not after he let Lisa and Chloe destroy what was left of our family. D’Amario Enterprises was Grandpa’s life’s work, meant for Mom, then for me. But after her cancer diagnosis, Dad took over, and Lisa made sure I’d never be fit to inherit it.

""You’re not university material,"" Dad sneered when I applied to colleges, parroting Lisa’s words. Yet I kept my grades up, clinging to one truth: the company would be mine at twenty-one.

The memories still clawed at me.

FLASHBACK

Jessica and Chloe barged into my room, their laughter sharp as knives. ""Ugly bit-ch,"" Jessica spat.

A book slammed into my face. Blood bloomed on my face. Then fists, nails, spit—each blow driving home my worthlessness. They destroyed my homework last, shredding it with glee.

""Know your place,"" Chloe hissed before slamming the door.

Alone, I sobbed, then rewrote the assignment until dawn. Weak. Pathetic.

FLASHBACK ENDS

I exhaled, flexing my hands—no longer trembling. At Harvard, I’d traded fear for fists. I even learned basic self-defence there.

Seeing how strong and decisive I am today gives me the confidence to take on the responsibility of being the heiress of D'Amario Enterprises.

Chapter 3

Adrian P.O.V

I've always gotten everything I wanted in life—from money to power, I had the finest of it all.

At 25, I'm one of the most successful businessmen in the country. Two years ago, my dad entrusted me with the full responsibility of the company, and today, it's one of the leading corporations in the USA. But the best part of my life is the love of my life, Jessica Martin. She's everything a man could ever ask for.

I've known Jessica since we were about 5 years old, but at 12, I moved to a boarding school in London. Despite the distance, Jessica and I always stayed in contact, and she supported me through every up and down.

During vacations, we always made sure to spend time together. I even remember Sarah, who used to be a good friend of ours. But after I moved to London, she started ignoring Jessica and even asked her to stay away from me. Jessica always told me how Sarah bullied her in high school.

As time went on, Jessica only grew more beautiful, both inside and out. Two years ago, after I took over the company, I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her, my life felt complete—she was not only pretty but also incredibly intelligent and talented. She was one of the top students in school and even got a scholarship to Harvard, but she chose to follow her pass-ion for modeling. Today, she's one of the highest-paid models in the industry.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on my office door. Without looking up, I told the person to come in.

I heard the click of heels on the floor and caught the familiar scent of perfume. Jessica walked towards me and sat on my desk.

""Good afternoon, love,"" I said, moving closer and taking her hands in mine.

""Hey, babe,"" she replied seductively, placing her other hand on my che-st.

""How was your day?"" I asked. She started telling me about her photoshoot that morning while I admired the beauty sitting before me. She looked amazing in that fitted white dress, her blond mid-length hair perfectly styled and falling onto her shoulders. As a model, she had a flawlessly toned body. She was perfect, and I was the luckiest man to have her in my life.

""Adrian, what are you wearing to your parents' wedding anniversary?""

""I want our outfits to coordinate since that's when you'll tell your parents about us,"" she said as she adjusted my tie.

""Well, you don't need to worry about that, love. My secretary has taken care of our outfits. You'll get the dress by tomorrow,"" I replied.

""Aww, thank you so much,"" she said happily. ""Now, if you're done with work, can we go home?""

""Sure, babe. Let me just call my secretary,"" I said, moving toward the phone to inform Josh of my departure.

I put on my coat, took Jessica's hand, and we interlocked our fingers as we walked toward the elevator.

I headed to my black Bugatti Veyron, opening the door for Jessica before jogging to the driver's seat. After starting the car, I soon stopped at a lavish Italian restaurant for dinner.

We chose a seat in the corner of the restaurant, and started discussing our future plans.

""Do you think your parents will accept our relationship?"" Jessica asked while sipping her wine.

""I don't think your mother is fond of me,"" she added as I narrowed my eyes.

""Why do you feel that way, Jess?""

""Ever since you came back from London, I've tried to talk to her, but she always ends up bringing up Sarah in the conversation.""

""She keeps telling me how sweet and kind Sarah is and how the three of us should hang out together like old times,"" Jessica said in a sad tone.

My jaw clenched at the mention of Sarah's name. What she did to Jessica was enough for me to hate her for the rest of my life.

""Sarah doesn't deserve to be our friend after what she did to you when I was gone. My mom doesn't know how ug-ly her true face is. Once she finds out, she'll stop talking about her,"" I replied angrily.

Even remembering how Sarah treated Jessica made my blood boil. Because of her, Jessica had to endure so many difficulties and traumas.

""Relax, babe. She's gone now. We don't have to worry about her,"" Jessica assured me, caressing my hand.

I smiled at her as the waiter brought our dinner. We ate while discussing the arrangements for my parents' anniversary party. Once we were done, I paid the bill, and we drove back to my penthouse.

I moved out of my parent's house two years ago and bought my place. After Jessica and I started dating, I asked her to move in with me. She's partially moved in, but she hasn't fully moved in yet.

As soon as we stepped into the penthouse, I slammed my li-ps against Jessica's. I grabbed her hair, causing her to tilt her head back, and I started kissing her neck hungrily, making her moan loudly.

Soon, we ended up on the couch. By this time, I had successfully removed her dress. She lay beneath me in her black lingerie, looking at me seductively as she started unbuttoning my shirt. Once she removed my shirt, followed by my pants, she took my member in her hand and began stroking it.

The room filled with our loud moans.

We ended up going for a second round and then showered together. Afterwards, we were so exhausted that we went straight to bed. I hugged her tightly in my arms, and soon, we both fell asleep.

Chapter 4

Adrian P.O.V

The past few days have been chaotic, as my parents' wedding anniversary is approaching. I've been busy with the arrangements for the party. It's also the day I plan to officially tell my parents about Jessica and my intention to marry her by the end of the year.

I even bought a ring for Jessica. If everything goes well, I'll propose to her at the party in front of everyone.

I looked up when I heard a knock on my office door and saw my father, James Parker, walking in with a serious expression.

""How are you, son? We hardly see you these days. Your mom misses you a lot,"" he said, sitting on the couch.

""I've just been caught up with work, Dad. I'll definitely visit Mom today,"" I replied while scanning some important files.

""I need to discuss something important with you. It's about the company."" I put my file down and turned to face him, waiting for him to continue.

""Since you've taken over the company, your mother and I think it's time for you to settle down. You'll be turning 26 this year, and we believe it's time for you to get married.""

Hearing this, I thought it was the perfect moment to tell him about Jessica, but before I could, he continued.

""We've decided you should marry the granddaughter of Stephen D'Amario. She's the heiress of the D'Amario family. Mr D'Amario was a close friend of your grandfather, so it would be a perfect match,"" my father revealed with a big smile.

I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine marrying anyone other than Jessica.

""No, Dad, I don't want to marry anyone else. I've already decided what I want in life, and marrying some heiress isn't part of it,"" I said angrily.

""In that case, the company will be transferred to Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter. Your grandfather and Mr. D'Amario signed an agreement that you and his granddaughter must marry, allowing the Parker and D'Amario companies to merge for mutual benefit,"" he said calmly.

""I'm still not marrying her. To he-ll with this danm agreement!"" I snapped angrily.

""Oh, son, you must marry her. If you refuse, 40% of Parker Enterprises will go to her. If she refuses, 40% of D'Amario Enterprises will come to us. If you both refuse, 50% of each company's shares will go to charity,"" he explained.

I heaved a big sigh, annoyed and worried about how to explain this to Jessica. Every plan I made for us seemed to be crumbling.

""I'll leave now; your mother is probably waiting for me,"" he said, walking out of my office.

As I pondered this new problem, my phone rang. It was Jessica. I answered, and her sweet voice came through the line.

""Hey, babe! Are you still at the office? Did you forget about our date night at my place?"" she asked.

I had completely forgotten about the date night due to my busy schedule, but I quickly covered my negligence.

""Of course, love. I can't wait to see you,"" I said, smirking at the thought of holding her in my arms tonight.

""Alright, see you at 7 then. Bye, love you,"" she said.

""Love you too, babe."" I hung up and went back to thinking about how to handle this marriage situation. How would Jessica react?

I immediately called my best friend, Noah. He's the COO of Parker Enterprises. We met in boarding school, and we've been best friends ever since.

I picked up the intercom and called my secretary. ""Could you please ask Mr. Andrews to come to my office immediately?""

Within 10 minutes, Noah walked in. ""Hey, everything good?"" he asked as he sat down across from me.

""My father wants me to marry Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter, or else the company goes to charity.""

""What?! No way. We've worked so hard for the company these past two years. It would all be wasted if it goes to charity,"" Noah exclaimed. ""What about Jessica? Did you tell her?""

""Not yet, bro. I'm planning to tell her tonight,"" I replied, massaging my temples.

""Isn't D'Amario Enterprises owned by Neil Darrell?"" Noah asked.

I immediately realized he was right. ""If Neil Darrell is running D'Amario Enterprises, then the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry is Chloe Darrell,"" I said, connecting the dots.

""Exactly. You can talk to Jessica about this. She can easily convince Chloe to refuse the proposal since they're best friends,"" Noah suggested.

""That's what I was thinking. I need to get to Jessica's place now."" I quickly left the office and headed to Jessica's apartment.

I arrived and rang the bell. Within seconds, she opened the door. A smile formed on my face as I saw her. She wrapped her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. I kissed her back passionately. Soon, we were undressed and made our way to the bedroom. After hours of being together, we finally went downstairs for dinner.

I or-dered sushi since Jessica can barely cook. To be honest, she's a terrible cook—she can hardly boil water—but she's perfect in every other way, and she's all I want.

We finished dinner, talking about our day when I suddenly remembered the conversation with my dad.

""Babe, I need to tell you something important,"" I said, holding her hands close to my che-st.

I explained the entire situation, from the marriage proposal to the merger, and the consequences if we backed out.

Before I could tell her about Chloe, she snapped at me angrily, ""So you want to leave me and marry some random brat now?""

""No, babe, the only person I want to marry is you. I can't even think of marrying someone else,"" I reassured her.

""And this marriage won't happen. All you need to do is convince Chloe to refuse the proposal.""

""Chloe? What does she have to do with this proposal?"" she asked.

""She's the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry, and since she's your best friend, you can easily convince her to refuse,"" I explained.

A smile formed on her li-ps, and she hugged me tightly.

""That can be done easily. She's dating Justin now, so I doubt she'd ever want to marry you,"" she said happily.

""And I'll never marry or love anyone but you,"" I told her, pressing my kiss to her forehead.

Chapter 5

Sarah P.O.V

I felt tense and doomed after hearing what Grandpa and Grandma told me. They arrived in the States last night, and today they've given me the biggest shock of my life.

According to them, I must marry for the merger or lose a 40% share of Amario Enterprises. Before they could finish their next sentence, I slammed my hands on my lap and stood up.

""I can't accept this proposal, Grandpa. I just graduated, and right now, I want to explore new things. I don't want to get married so soon.""

""Sweetheart, we're not forcing you, but we want someone strong to take care of you. Grandpa and I are getting old, dear; we won't always be here to support you. That's why we want you to be secure and happy,"" Grandma said, making me sit down again as she held my hands.

I thought about everything happening. When it comes to marriage, love, respect, and trust are the pillars of happiness.

I've always been nervous about relationships, scared of rejection and being unloved.

I feared I'd be the one trying to maintain the relationship while the other person didn't care.

""Sarah, we always want what's best for you. But remember, if you reject this proposal, the company will be ruined. This company was your mother's dream. Sophia worked hard to bring it to where it is today. But honey, we don't want to force you,"" Grandpa said, comforting me.

Thinking about my mother, I wondered what she would do in my place. Would she accept this to save the company? She worked tirelessly until her illness confined her to bed.

""Grandpa, I need to think this over. I'll let you know my decision soon,"" I said with a weak smile and left.

I went to my room and closed the door. I lay on my bed, replaying the conversation with Grandpa and Grandma.

I never thought I'd get married so soon, let alone just for the sake of the company. But deep down, I knew this company held my mother's memories, her hard work, and her dream of making Amario Enterprises one of the leading companies in the world.

I always thought that when I married, it would be for love, not a business arrangement.

I never had time to date in high school; I was always busy with studies and a part-time job. If any guy tried to ask me out, Chloe and Jessica made sure I never went.

I still remember the night after graduation when there was a party at our house.

FLASHBACK

I was in my room, checking my email about the applications I had submitted to various universities. I could hear the loud music coming from downstairs.

Chloe had invited everyone to the party. She even asked me to join, but I politely declined, knowing she and Jessica would likely have a plan to humiliate me again.

Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I closed my laptop and walked over. Opening it, I saw Justin standing there, holding two cans of beer.

""Hey, Sarah!"" he greeted me and walked into my room, sitting on my bed and looking around.

""Hey, Justin! What brings you here?"" I asked, walking towards him.

Justin was in the same grade as me and Chloe. He was one of the popular guys in high school. We weren't close friends, but we had worked on some projects and assignments together. He seemed like a genuine guy.

""Why are you sitting here alone? Why didn't you come downstairs and join us?"" he asked.

""Well, I don't like loud music, and I'm not used to these parties. Besides, I had some important work to do,"" I told him.

""Oh, that's alright. Everyone has their own tastes and choices,"" he said, offering me one of the beers he was holding. I politely declined.

""C'mon, relax a bit, Sarah. One beer won't harm you,"" he chuckled.

I hesitated but eventually accepted the beer and took a sip.

One beer won't harm me.

""So, what are your plans after high school?"" he asked, drinking his beer.

""Well, I'm planning to study architecture, but I haven't decided which university to choose.""

Before I could say more, I started feeling dizzy. I could hear Justin talking, but I couldn't understand what he was saying.

I could faintly hear Chloe and Jessica's voices inside the room. I heard them talking, but I couldn't make out the words.

Jessica's voice came closer as she whispered in my right ear.

""Let's have some fun, Sarah,"" she said, laughing wickedly.

I tried to get up, but Chloe pushed me back onto the bed. My T-shirt was yanked off aggressively, and my jeans were pulled down. I tried to shout for help, but no words came out. I could hear Chloe, Jessica, and Justin giggling.

I was lying there in just my underwear. Someone pulled me closer, and I heard Justin whisper something in my ear. All I could understand was that they were up to something terrible.

Justin gripped my waist, then started svcking on my neck.

""Please... don't,"" I begged them.

But they didn't stop. After a few minutes, I heard Jessica say it was enough; they'd gotten what they wanted.

I sighed in relief, but then I felt someone tugging at my hair. Before I could react, they started cutting it. I struggled with what little energy I had left, but a sharp kick to my ribs knocked me out.

FLASHBACK ENDS

When I regained consciousness, it was already the next day. I was still on the bed, my underwear tor-n. When I looked in the mirror, I saw bruises around my ribs and belly. My hair was nearly all gone—I was almost bald.

Jessica, Justin, and Chloe had made a video of me and Justin in bed. In the video, only my face was visible, while only Justin's back was shown.

They shared the video on every social media platform, and the whole school assumed I had shot it and shared it to gain popularity.

I even told Dad, but he blamed me for not being careful. Later, he chose to believe others, thinking I had purposely shared the video.

A tear slipped down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Because of that night, I couldn't trust any guy. Although I managed to overcome this fear when I moved to Boston, becoming more comfortable around new people, I still struggled.

I even went on a few dates, but things never progressed. I was still uncomfortable with intimacy and trusting anyone.

Thinking about the marriage proposal, I realized I still didn't know who I was supposed to marry. All I knew from Grandpa was that he was the young CEO of a rapidly growing construction company.

I spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about the marriage and the company merger.

By 4 a.m., after a night of deep contemplation, I was finally ready with my decision.

Chapter 6

Sarah P.O.V

It was nearly 11 in the morning, and I was ready with my decision. I went downstairs and knocked on Grandpa's door; he opened it.

I walked into the room and saw Grandma sitting on the couch, reading a magazine. I sat next to her while Grandpa sat across from us. I cleared my throat before speaking.

""Grandpa, Grandma, I've made my decision. I want to save my mother's company; I don't want to lose Amario Enterprises. I'm ready for the marriage,"" I told them.

As soon as I finished speaking, I saw both my grandparents beaming with happiness. Grandma immediately hugged me tightly.

""Oh Sarah, I knew you would make the right decision. I'm sure this marriage and merger will bring much happiness to your life,"" Grandpa said while kissing my forehead.

""I'm sure you'll fulfil the responsibilities of both a wife and the new CEO of Amario Enterprises,"" Grandma said, clasping her hands together.

Both Grandma and Grandpa started discussing the merger and wedding. It had been ages since I'd seen them this happy. When Mom was alive, we always spent our vacations with Grandpa and Grandma.

We used to have so much fun then; Mom and Grandma would bake cakes and muffins together, while Dad and Grandpa taught me horseback riding and swimming.

Those were some of my happiest memories with my family.

Thinking of my father made me realize it had been five years since I'd seen him.

During those years, he never contacted me, and I didn't make any effort either. Before moving back here, I hoped he might visit, but it's been nearly a month since I returned, and he hasn't shown up.

""Sarah, dear, you'll be coming with me to Amario Enterprises tomorrow to sign the documents. You'll also meet your fiancé before signing,"" Grandpa informed me.

""Yes, dear, it would be good if you two met and got to know each other before the wedding,"" Grandma added.

I gave them a weak smile, but deep inside, I was nervous about the whole situation. Suddenly, it occurred to me that I still didn't know the name of the person I was marrying.

""Grandpa, may I know the name of the person I'm marrying?"" I asked.

""Oh! Well, his name is Adrian Parker, the CEO of Parker Enterprises,"" he replied.

As soon as he said the name, I felt the ground slip from under my feet.

""Adrian Parker? The son of James and Lauren Parker?"" I asked, hoping it wasn't him.

""Yes, sweetheart, he's the one,"" he answered.

I was utterly shocked. He was the same Adrian Parker who used to be my friend—a friend who abandoned me and our friendship.

""I'll see you later; I have some work to do,"" I told them and kissed their cheeks.

I immediately grabbed my car keys and started driving without a specific destination. After an hour, I found myself standing in front of my mother's grave.

I sat there for hours, remembering how happy our lives were when she was alive. Maybe I wouldn't be in this situation if she were here. Maybe I would have had a normal life with a happy family.

But now, everything is different; nothing is as I imagined or wished.

I still remember Adrian Parker, the guy who used to be one of my close friends along with Jessica, but it's been years since we talked or saw each other.

When he left for London, we three promised to stay connected no matter what. Even when Jessica started ignoring me, Adrian and I stayed in touch through emails, social media, and calls.

But slowly, the calls became less frequent, and eventually, he stopped calling altogether. I tried reaching out, but my calls went to voicemail. We were still connected through messages and emails, but by the end of sophomore year, he stopped replying.

Occasionally, I overheard Jessica and Chloe talking about Adrian. I heard them discuss the plans Adrian and Jessica made for her visit to London that summer.

It became clear he was purposely avoiding me. Maybe he chose Jessica over me, though all I wanted was for us three to stay friends. But they both decided to throw me out of their lives as if our friendship meant nothing to them.

FLASHBACK

It had been almost two years since I last heard from Adrian. He visited New York every summer, and he came for vacation that year too. I saw him hanging out with Chloe and Jessica the other day.

I was in my room, finishing up a painting, when I heard noises from downstairs, indicating Chloe had brought her friends over again.

I decided to ignore them and continue my work. After finishing my painting, I heard my stomach growl. I quickly put on my hoodie and went to the kitchen to grab something to eat. As I headed back to my room, holding a mug of hot coffee, I heard Chloe call from the living room.

""Hey Sarah, what are you doing alone? Come join us,"" she said.

""No, thanks, I've got some work to do,"" I politely declined. I was about to leave when I suddenly heard Adrian's voice.

""C'mon, Sarah, join us. A few minutes won't hurt,"" he insisted.

Though my instincts told me not to, I decided to join them for a few minutes. I walked into the living room, holding my coffee mug. I saw familiar faces from school, including Jessica and Justin.

I smiled and looked at Adrian. It had been so long since I'd seen him up close. As I walked toward the couch, Chloe stuck out her leg, causing me to lose my balance. I fell flat on the floor, spilling my coffee all over Jessica. Before I could even stand, Chloe started shouting.

""You did that on purpose, didn't you, Sarah? You're always finding ways to harm or insult Jessica,"" she yelled.

""I didn't do it on purpose; I'm so sorry, Jessica,"" I said, standing up.

""Ah, it's fine, Sarah,"" Jessica said, though I could see the smirk on her face.

""No, it's not fine. You did that on purpose. Adrian, this isn't the first time she's harmed Jessica,"" Chloe said, as Adrian was busy wiping Jessica with cold water.

""I knew you always hated Jessica, but I didn't know you could actually hurt her,"" Adrian said angrily.

Before I could defend myself, Adrian grabbed me harshly and pushed me out of the room.

""Get out of here; I don't want someone like you near me or Jessica.""

I could sense his anger and hatred in his voice, but I also saw his concern for Jessica in his eyes. Without further explanation, I ran to my room and shut the door behind me. I knew Chloe and Jessica would torture me again once everyone left, as I had ruined their evening.

I was angry at myself for being a coward; I was tired of being weak and fragile.

FLASHBACK ENDS

That was the last time I saw him. After that, I did my best to avoid him, especially around Jessica and Chloe.

And now, I'm supposed to marry him. How can this happen?

I sat there for hours, thinking about everything, remembering my family and mother. Finally, as it grew dark, I decided to go home.

""You need to be strong, Sarah. You can survive this.""

Chapter 7

Adrian P.O.V

Tomorrow is the day we sign the agreement with Amario Enterprises. I was anxious about the marriage and merger, but Jessica reassured me that Chloe would handle everything.

She explained the entire situation the other day, and we discussed the plan regarding the agreement last evening.

""Dad hasn't mentioned anything about this agreement yet. Maybe he's waiting until the last minute so I can't back out. What if he doesn't listen to me if I refuse to marry?"" Chloe asked nervously.

Chloe had a point. What if her dad didn't accept her decision?

""Don't worry, I have a backup plan,"" Jessica interrupted.

Noah stepped into the room carrying his coffee and sat beside me.

""What are you guys talking about?"" Noah asked as he placed his cup on the table.

""About how to decline the marriage agreement without Adrian losing his company,"" Jessica informed him.

""Well, as I was saying, the backup plan is if Chloe's father opposes her decision, Adrian and Chloe can proceed with the agreement and get engaged. But as the wedding day approaches, you can back out,"" Jessica explained. Noah looked amused, while Chloe still seemed confused.

""Also, it's not stated anywhere in the agreement that you can't separate or divorce later. Once the merger is finalized, Adrian can tell his parents he wants to marry me, not Chloe,"" Jessica said, running her fingers through her hair.

""We'll try this for now since we don't have any other option,"" I agreed, and we ended our discussion.

We had dinner together, and then everyone went home. I asked Jessica to stay with me because I wanted her to accompany me to the company tomorrow.

The next morning, Jessica and I were on our way to Amario Enterprises. I held Jessica's hand, and she kept reminding me that everything would go as planned.

When we arrived at our destination, I intertwined my hand with Jessica's as we arrived at the lobby. Everyone stopped working and focused on us. I smirked, seeing their reactions.

We informed the receptionist of our arrival, and she directed us to the 28th floor, where the conference room was. As we arrived, I saw my father talking to Neil Darrell. Chloe was sitting next to her father, looking tense. There was also an older man with a strong, authoritative presence.

""Good morning, everyone,"" I greeted them. I took a seat next to my father, while Jessica sat beside Chloe. My father gave Jessica a confused look but chose to ignore her and turned his attention to the older man.

The older man cleared his throat to gain everyone's attention.

""Hello, everyone. I'm Stephen D'Amario. I started this company, and later, my daughter continued building it. I hope you all know why we're here. We're here for the merger to strengthen our relations,"" he said seriously.

Neil Darrell looked tense, sweating despite the air conditioning.

""This company has been handled by my son-in-law, Neil Darrell. But now, I want to transfer full authority to my granddaughter. She will be the new CEO. As per the agreement, the legal heiress of Amario Enterprises must marry the heir of Parker Enterprises,"" he stated firmly.

I was surprised Chloe would be CEO; her interests lie more in parties, clothes, and makeup than in business.

""Is it mandatory for the heir and heiress to marry?"" I asked, earning a sharp look from my father, signalling me to be quiet.

""Yes, son, it's necessary as per the agreement. You know the consequences if not,"" Mr. D'Amario answered. A man in his late 20s handed me the contract papers. I was about to read them when I heard Mr. D'Amario speaking nervously on the phone. He seemed disturbed and worried.

I looked at Jessica, who nodded, urging me to proceed. I signed the documents and returned the file to the man.

Chloe reached for the file, but Mr. D'Amario took it back. Jessica, Chloe, and I were confused, as was Mr. Darrell.

""Isn't Chloe going to sign?"" Jessica asked.

""Why would Chloe sign? We didn't even need her here,"" Mr. D'Amario replied, looking confused.

""Isn't she the one I'm marrying? As per the agreement, I have to marry your granddaughter, so Chloe's signature is needed,"" I said.

""You're marrying Sarah Darrell, the heiress of Amario Enterprises—my real granddaughter,"" he said seriously.

My head started spinning. I was supposed to marry Sarah Darrell. I grabbed the file and read the name. It was indeed Sarah Darrell, and she had already signed the papers.

The last time I heard about Sarah was five years ago when she ran away with a guy after making a video that went viral on social media.

""Sarah isn't capable of handling this business. I think you've made the wrong decision,"" Mr. Darrell said, shaking with anger.

""I don't need anyone's advice on my decisions, especially when it concerns my company,"" Mr. D'Amario hissed.

Everyone was shocked except my father. I couldn't imagine marrying her. She was one of those selfish, mean people I despised.

""Sorry, I can't marry her. That's my final decision. I want someone of my class and standard—someone who can stand beside me as my wife. I don't think Sarah is the one,"" I said, about to leave.

Suddenly, I heard my dad's voice.

""If you back out of this marriage, you'll not only lose the shares but also Parker Enterprises. I'll transfer everything to your cousin, Enrique,"" my dad warned.

I stopped, stunned. I couldn't believe him. He knew how hard I worked for the company. I sighed in frustration; I couldn't let this happen. I couldn't lose Parker Enterprises.

""Okay, I'll do it,"" I agreed reluctantly. Jessica's eyes filled with tears, but this was my only option since I had already signed the papers.

""Good. We'll announce your engagement this weekend at the anniversary party,"" my dad informed me.

I left with Jessica. During the ride, I tried to comfort her, but she kept crying. Once we reached my apartment, I made her sit on the bed and calm down.

""Jessica, please stop crying, love,"" I said, hugging her tightly.

1mpxt5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mpxt5o/what_is_happening_to_my_pulls_sagebreville_the/,What is happening to my pulls? [Sage/Breville The Bambino & MiiCoffee DF-54],"Hello fellow coffee loving people! 

My girlfriend and I are desperate- it is not possible to pull a normal shot of espresso anymore. Let me elaborate:

Machine: Sage/Breville The Bambino (not Plus)  
Grinder: MiiCoffee DF-54  
Usual grindsetting: 10 out of 30  
Bean: Espresso Guatemala, dark roast, roasted around 2 weeks ago  
Bean dose: 9g for a single pull  
Yield: usually around 20g  
Timing: about 25 seconds  
Puck prep: WDT and spring loaded tamper

After some dialing in, for the last several months these settings worked great for us, nice & even pull, good crema, around 18g of liquid. But for some weeks now, the pulls started to differ greatly. While the first was around 20g liquid, same prep and everything, the next pull, immediatly after that, is suddenly 35g. Plus it started spurting everywhere, but we could manage by holding the cup directly under the portafilter. 

Yesterday, while not perfect, the coffee still tasted fine and worked for us. Today morning, suddenly over 60g liquid came out and spraying completely everywhere. So I tried troubleshooting:

\- Find griner, of course! So I gradually decreased the grindsetting until 2 (out of 30). While there is little improvement, usually the machine choked on that setting. Now I still get 35g liquid and it's still spraying everywhere.

\- cleaning brewhead. I unscrewed the brewing head and cleaned the plate - no difference whatsoever.

\- must have to do something with channeling, right? So I checked the tamper, unscrewed it, checked the springs, put everything back together - no difference either.

\- tried different (shitty) beans - same problem as before

\- The thing bugging me the most is probably the unevenness of the yield. If I do the exact same steps, same grind size, same timing, same bean ofc, I get 50 to 100% difference in yield. How is this even possible? how am I supposed to work on a single variable, when it feels like a gamble? It used to be even...

Well, now I have run out of ideas and we would like to get back to the normal state somehow. That's why I came here for help What am I missing? Could the grinder or the machine be faulty? Could the temperature be an issue (it is getting extremely hot here in Germany for couple of days)? 

Sorry for the long post, but our desperation is real :D



Thank you very much for any ideas, related experiences or even just condolence - we really need it! :)

Alright folks, let’s be real for a second. Have you ever thought about how much pressure there is to put your face out there for everyone to see? I mean, who really wants to be the star of their own show, constantly on camera? 😳 But what if I told you that you could crush the game without ever showing your beautiful mug? Yeah, I said it—faceless growth strategies are not just a trend; they’re where the money’s at (at least, until they get banned!). 

**Here’s the scoop:**

- **Less Face, More Strategy**: When you’re faceless, you can focus on creating killer content *without* those pesky nerves. It’s all about your message, not your looks!
  
- **Diversified Income Streams**: My faceless strategy has led to multiple income streams. Think affiliate marketing, digital products, or even social media management—all while keeping that mystery around you!

- **Automation is Your Bestie**: Use AI tools (I can’t recommend this enough: check out this helpful guide [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals)) to crank out content faster than you can say “money, money, money.” Seriously! 

- **Create a Brand with a Twist**: Ever considered branding yourself around a persona rather than a face? Successful YouTube channels and blogs are thriving without a clear, identifiable face. You can do it too—just be creative!

Picture this: you wake up, sip your coffee, and boom! Your affiliate links are rolling in, while you’re still in your PJs. Isn’t that the dream? 

💡 Now, I’m not saying it’s all sunshine and rainbows. There’s definitely a learning curve and a bit of trial and error involved. But think about it—are you willing to step out of your comfort zone for more freedom? 🤔 

Let’s share some of our favorite faceless growth hacks! Have any hilarious moments where you tried to film yourself and ended up looking like a hot mess? Or maybe a success story where you started faceless and saw your income soar?

when the nights were long

He never asks me to orbit him
only to walk beside his tides,
to let him pull and release,
to trust the quiet rhythm
that comes from loving
without noise.

I stand at the window,

On paper, it sounds like an easy market to enter. In reality, it’s a bloodbath.

[Source: Internet](https://preview.redd.it/5ni7tgp0yyif1.png?width=999&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cddf05038c01163c4eaf22472d94f96be35e728)

**Three big reasons:**

1. **Low barrier to entry → instant copycats** 
   * Sugar, water, flavor, packaging. That’s all you need.
   * No refrigeration, long shelf life, dirt-cheap ingredients.
   * Which means the moment you launch something successful, 50+ copycats pop up in weeks. 
2. **No brand loyalty → flavor rules** 
   * Ask for Mentos, get Center Fresh? Fine.
   * Ask for Happydent, get Orbit? Also fine.
   * In India, the *flavor* matters, not the brand name. 
3. **Regional taste fragmentation** 
   * North: coffee & mixed flavors.
   * East: orange, lemon, mango.
   * West: strawberry.
   * South: caramel & mint.
   * One flavor won’t conquer the whole country.

And then there’s the **price rigidity problem**:

* HBC sells for ₹0.50-₹1 per piece.
* You can’t nudge the price up gradually. If sugar costs jump, doubling the price kills demand instantly.
* Even giants like Melody have never touched ₹100 crore in revenue despite decades in the market.

**Pulse’s Risk - Entering a Market Where 90% Fail**

In 2009, 70 new candy brands entered India. By the end of the year, 63 were dead.

Pulse knew this. They also knew they’d be up against decades-old incumbents with nationwide distribution.

Still, the DS Group (makers of Catch Masala and Rajnigandha) went in. But they didn’t rush.

They did **two years** of dedicated R&D before launch to bring out a product that was about to disrupt the whole market. 

**Cracking the Product Formula**

**Step 1: Flavor research - finding the universal hook.** Their research showed raw mango + mango together held nearly **50%** of the HBC flavor market. Raw mango also had one huge advantage: every Indian, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, had childhood memories tied to it, pickles, chutneys, summer snacks.

**Step 2: Sensory-Specific Satiety; Why Most Candies Get Boring Halfway**

One of the Pulse R&D team’s most valuable discoveries wasn’t about flavor preference at all, it was about **flavor fatigue**.

In food science, there’s a phenomenon called **sensory-specific satiety (SSS)**. It’s the process where the pleasure from a particular flavor declines as you continue eating it, even if you’re still physically hungry. In plain English, the first bite is magic, the rest is just… okay.

[Source: DS Group](https://preview.redd.it/qjjd0sx7yyif1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=e85bff9caceb4a66330e0c671cdcbace68c1dcc1)

Here’s what Pulse’s product team found when they studied how people consumed existing candies in the Indian market:

* **Initial Flavor Spike** → Most candies hit hard in the first few seconds. Whether it’s mango, orange, or caramel, the opening note floods your taste buds.
* **Rapid Decline** → After the first 20-30 seconds, your tongue adapts. The intensity flattens, the novelty wears off.
* **Boring Middle** → The candy is still in your mouth, but there’s nothing new happening. You’re chewing just to finish it, not because you’re enjoying it.
* **Missed Retention Moment** → This middle stage is where brands lose emotional engagement. The consumer isn’t wowed, so they don’t *crave* the next piece.

The R&D team mapped this on a flavor-intensity curve for multiple candies and every single one followed the same pattern: **sharp peak → steep drop → flat line**.

For a mass-market candy in a low-loyalty segment, this was deadly. If the experience doesn’t hook you all the way through, you’ll happily grab a competitor’s candy next time.

**Step 3: Layered flavor experience**

So instead of designing a single-flavor candy, they built a **staggered release system**:

1. **Phase 1:** Sharp, tangy raw mango hit → triggers nostalgia + instant sensory excitement.
2. **Phase 2:** Slow emergence of a subtle masala note → reactivates the taste buds just as they’re adapting.
3. **Phase 3:** Bold, powdery burst of dried mango masala in the center → surprise spike in intensity, reigniting the “wow” factor.
4. **Phase 4:** Gentle sweet finish → cleanses the palate, leaves a positive aftertaste, and sets you up to want another candy.

By layering flavors to **reset the sensory experience multiple times**, Pulse extended consumer enjoyment from the first second to the last, turning each candy into a mini “taste rollercoaster.”

This single design choice made the product more addictive than any other competitor on the market. It also gave Pulse a **defensible moat**; competitors could copy the flavor, but few could match the pacing, intensity shifts, and mouthfeel engineering without DS Group’s masala expertise.

**Solving the Pricing & Economics Problem**

Here’s where Pulse played 4D chess.

At the time, 86% of the candy market sold 2 - 2.5g pieces for ₹0.50.

Pulse entered at ₹1. Here’s why that was genius:

* **No pre-existing consumer reference price** → no pushback.
* **Inflation-proof margins** → avoided the trap of starting low, then doubling price later.
* **50p coins were disappearing** → psychologically, ₹1 didn’t feel like a jump.
* **Better retailer margins** → ensured prime shelf placement.

**Solving the Distribution**

DS Group had a **nationwide distribution network** from years of selling Rajnigandha, Pass Pass, and Catch. They didn’t just aim for supermarkets, they blanketed:

[Source: DS Group](https://preview.redd.it/tdxgvndcyyif1.png?width=1893&format=png&auto=webp&s=4acdb5541df5fada63bb4728252ead2ce8ffb480)

* **8.5 lakh retail outlets**
* **2,500 distributors**
* Everything from roadside paan shops to D-Mart. 

Then came the genius move: targeting **smokers**. Smokers often buy candies at paan shops to mask cigarette smell. Retailers were incentivized to push Pulse and smokers bought in bulk, 5-10 candies at a time (mostly to pay a round figure amount). Those candies went home, got shared, and Pulse became a household staple.

**Results**

* ₹100 crore in **8 months**.
* ₹300 crore in **2 years**.
* Expanded to UAE, UK, Singapore. 

**Key Business Lessons for Owners**

1. **Perfect before launch** \- Two years of R&D wasn’t wasted; it built a product impossible to ignore. 
2. **Intelligent disruption beats blind disruption** \- Innovation wasn’t just the masala core, but pairing it with smart pricing and bulletproof distribution. 
3. **Do simple things in a great way** \- Raw mango + masala wasn’t new. Doing it with precision, consistency, and national scalability was. 

**Ending Note…**

This is why Pulse’s story matters beyond candy.Even in a commoditized, cutthroat, low-margin category they won by:

* Obsessing over product experience.
* Making smart economic bets before launch.
* Exploiting distribution where competitors weren’t looking.

The former Wigan Civic Centre on Millgate is being completely transformed into something pretty special. Capital & Centric, working with Wigan Council, are converting the 1970s building into ""Civic"" - what looks set to become Wigan's most sustainable and well-equipped workspace when it opens in August 2025.

**What they're keeping from the original:** Rather than knocking it down, they're restoring the building's best brutalist features - the iconic waffle ceiling, terrazzo staircases, and those distinctive feature windows.

**Sustainability focus:** This isn't just a cosmetic makeover. Civic is targeting BREEAM Excellent certification and an EPC A energy rating - making it the only BREEAM-certified office building in Wigan. They're adding extensive landscaping, roof gardens, EV charging points, and secure cycle storage. With Wallgate and North Western stations nearby, it's properly connected for sustainable commuting too.

**What's going inside:**

* On-site gym and bike storage
* Rooftop terrace with views across Wigan
* Mini-cinema
* Cottons Café serving everything from morning coffee to after-work drinks
* Flexible office spaces from 477 to 2,424 square feet

**For local businesses:** The spaces range from coworking desks for freelancers and startups, to fully furnished suites, right up to private offices with their own front doors. All-inclusive pricing means no hidden costs, and they're offering flexible lease terms.

It's interesting seeing a piece of Wigan's civic history getting a new lease of life rather than being demolished, offering local entrepreneurs and businesses something not seen before.

It's not like I don't have success in my own country, but there's some level of charm and connection I get with foreign girls. (I have an international job) unfortunately, this means these connections are short lived due to distance.

\- Sexy French Girl 1 - I, without meaning to be as forward as I was, told her she has ""The sexiest accent,"" and she responded that my British accent is the type that ""Enchants women physically."" She then asked me to whisper in her ear, and I did, and then escalate further it did. 

\- Sexy French Girl 2 - I was in France, and decided to try my best to order my coffee and croissant in French, looked up and the barista was drop dead gorgeous. I messed up the sit in or take out part and had to point and smile at the seats instead, and for the rest of my stay when I went for my morning coffee, she would sit down at my table with me and teach me French. On my last day, I decided to tell her in French that she was very beautiful, and her reaction was gold. She lit up in such a gorgeous way, and told me she felt a magnetic pull towards me, and also fawned over my accent.

Sexy Dutch Girl - A while ago I worked in a coffee shop, and I remembered I had to talk to the customers occasionally, so I spoke to this girl and I admit her looks is one of the reason I chose her, and I was not trying to impress her but instead do my job, yet 5 minutes later she returned, said ""You are the best,"" and gave me a piece of paper with her number on it and a heart.

Sexy Latina Girl - She was a mutual of my friends, and we met in a bar with everyone, and we ended up sitting alone while she taught me spanish words - and she was a fucking 10.  She had a certain charm to her that I find rare in my own country.

Sexy Russian Girl - She had some heavy bags, so I offered to carry them for her, and she went on about how chivalry is not actually dead, and a few days later she was in my house. Unfortunately, she was a bit of a narcissist who thought my lack of love for Putin was a problem.  

Sexy Italian Girl - At the bar we were drinking wine, and I spoke to her about Italian food. I claimed I could make a ""Banging Lasagna"" and she found the word ""banging"" funny, and then she challenged me to make her a lasagne, so I had her round a few days later for lasagne and Italian wine. 

Why do I prefer foreign women? And perhaps pertinently, why do foreign women prefer me in comparison my own country? The contrast is staggering, abroad I pick up girls by accident. At home, I have to try much harder, and while I can date at home, I conversely find the approach of foreign women charms me much more.

For examples, I have for my sci fi world:

—-Drinks:

1-Hydration Class:

Hydration Class liquids are the backbone of survival in deep space. Harvested from Cryovore-type ships that roam the void collecting frozen asteroids, drifting nebulae clouds, and cometary ice, or filtered from volatile chemicals in advanced Filtration Chambers, these beverages are engineered for purity and efficiency. They can be delivered in plain, mildly flavored, or nutrient-infused varieties, sometimes supplemented with trace electrolytes, micro-minerals, or adaptogenic compounds to enhance cellular hydration and stave off long-term physiological stress. 

2-Stimulant Class:

The Stimulant Class encompasses beverages designed to sharpen cognition and heighten alertness. Standard examples include coffee, tea, or synthetic energy drinks augmented with nootropics, neuro-stimulants, or synaptic enhancers. Effects can range from subtle mental clarity to intense reaction-time boosts for ship pilots, engineers, or combat crews. Organic variants, such as genuine tea leaves or caffeine-rich coffee beans, are considered a premium subset known as Organic Class Drinks. These are often paired with nanofiltered sweeteners or flavor modulators, allowing users to tailor sensory experience while maintaining metabolic efficiency.

3-Nutrient Class:

Nutrient Class drinks are essentially portable sustenance, engineered for maximum efficiency and rapid absorption. This category includes high-protein or fortified meal shakes, bioengineered plant milks, artificial dairy products, fruit and vegetable juices, milkshakes, lassis, and nutrient gels. Many formulations incorporate nanobot digestives or bioengineered gut flora that break down food instantly, releasing energy and micronutrients without the need for solid ingestion. Advanced versions can even adapt their nutrient profile to the user’s current metabolic requirements, making them essential for long-duration missions or survival in environments where conventional food is scarce.

4-Carbonated Class:

Carbonated Class beverages combine taste, texture, and sensory novelty. Sparkling waters, sodas, and kombucha are infused with nano-carbonation, creating tingling sensations, glowing effervescence, or even programmable flavor-memory imprints that allow a drink to “remember” a previous taste experience. Specialized editions may include luminescent or holographic bubbles for social settings or therapeutic purposes, where the physical sensation of fizz can enhance mood and focus. Certain luxury brands experiment with multi-sensory carbonation, pairing taste with controlled aroma dispersal or micro-vibration effects on the tongue.

5-Psychotropic Class:

Psychotropic Class drinks are designed to alter mood, perception, or social behavior. They range from alcoholic beverages and recreational cocktails to mood-modifying synthetics, some containing mild neural warners, emotional stabilizers, or memory-modulating agents. Beyond recreational use, certain psychotropic beverages are tailored for therapeutic or ritualistic purposes, calming high-stress environments or enhancing social cohesion in isolated crews. Rare “Neuro-Vintages” are aged to develop complex psychoactive profiles, where flavor and effect evolve in tandem, offering unique sensory and cognitive experiences.

This blend required a fine grind to produce a decent pull, although anytime I’ve attempted to grind fine ( 1 or 2 ) it’s clunky and grinder wheel moves on it’s own to what seems to be a desired setting for itself.

I have taken the grinder apart below the hopper, cleaned it and ensured the nut is tight, happened again instantly.

1. Go to some kind of group or event and meet a new person who reaches out to meet up for coffee, they seem to want to be friends;

2. Meet the person but struggle with feeling like I am not positive enough in their presence and notice they start to invalidate some of the more negative/honest things that I say;

3. This then makes me realise I can't be totally honest with the person so I start acting falsely cheerful and positive around them when I don't feel it inside to avoid the invalidating comments, and then I become tired;

4. The person maybe picks up on this vibe and ghosts me a few months later or they reach out to keep meeting up but the thought exhausts me because I know I'll have to mask my feelings around them which is exhausting and makes me feel alienated. If I meet them again I don't feel connected to them for this reason.

I have suffered from depression for 20 years and despite a lot of therapy I feel like my baseline is just not as positive as others. I do get really happy and joyful at times, and I have hobbies I really enjoy so I'm not constantly miserable. But a lot of things about our society trouble me so I find it hard to always feel positive, and I also don't think I should be forced to - I like to feel the full range of my emotions.

I really wish I had friends I could just be myself and feel my feelings around. Not in a crazy overwhelming way but just being honest if I am feeling sad and have the people be ok with that, and not try to invalidate my feelings.",2,1755168752.0,lonely,6,1.0,False

1mpx7m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hingeapp/comments/1mpx7m2/confusing_date/,Confusing date,"Hey there :) Yesterday I (M24) went on my first date 4 months after breaking up with my ex gf of 2.5 years. I‘ve matched with this girl looking for a LTR on the app and we clicked right away. Texts got longer and she quickly gave me her phone number. I asked her out after some days of texting but we couldn‘t meet for two more weeks. Our texts got so long that at some point it took more than an hour to type the actual replies. I was getting a bit cautious when she came up with ideas for a second, third, fourth date when we haven‘t even met in person once. I thought of it as a nice sign of interest and consistency that isn‘t usual in online dating though.

So the day of our date came and I was obviously quite nervous and couldn‘t really get rid of the expectancies that rose with more than half a month of texting. She told me beforehand that she had a window of five to six hours and we decided on two activities. The first minutes in person were like many first dates. I was nervous, she seemed more nervous than I expected, we stammered around for a bit and started heading for a coffee place. We were so involved in conversation (or nervousness) that we passed the cafe without noticing until we hit a main street. I was a bit irritated by the fact that she paid for our order and pleasantly surprised that she still wanted to play mini-golf. I decided to pay for both of us but the game turned out to be the most boring part of our date since it put our ongoing conversation on hold.

Afterwards she asked me if I wanted to walk back along the riverbank so we did that until we were almost out of town again. So we turned around and walked all over central town, grabbed some ice cream, bought some drinks and had great conversations overall. We actually got stopped by a street promoter yelling “hey you two lovebirds“, which made her chuckle and made me raise an awkward smile. After almost 4.5 hours she told me she needed to head home soon since she was meeting friends in the evening (which I knew about beforehand so no surprise) and asked me what my plans were for the evening. She offered me to join my walk to the parking lot where we hugged, wished each other a fun evening and parted our ways. No “see you soon“, no “text you later“, neither by her nor me. I was biting my tongue immediately after saying my goodbyes because I must‘ve sounded a little too relieved.

During our date I already realized that it didn‘t click with me immediately but I still felt attracted to her. It wasn‘t a highly flirtatious date or one with sparks of romance but I felt that there was enough mutual interest and sympathy for a second one. The thing is that I was never the type of guy to go all in on a first date especially after not having any dates for three years and I have experienced pushing away persons interested in me because I was giving mixed signals. She was interested in some way at least but I might‘ve shied away from opportunities to initiate physical contact or more forward flirting. I wasn‘t exactly sure if her interest was just platonic or if she was just also being a bit more shy than I expected her to be after weeks of texting. I realized that if that is true, I also didn‘t really make it easy for her to express how she was feeling..

There hasn‘t been any contact since yesterday, the match is still there, still following each other on socials but late last night I saw that her location on the app has changed. Normally I would see it as a clear sign of continuing searching. Since I have experienced mutual interest that turned cold because of misunderstandings, I don‘t really want to cut off contact because of some mixed thoughts or negative interpretations. Right now the ball isn‘t in anyone‘s court. It‘s still lying around in the parking lot where we said goodbye I think lol. So before I try to break stalemate I would like to know if it could be worth it or if I should just file it as an experience.",0,1755168605.0,hingeapp,5,0.33,False

# Chapter 1

Lexie

At first glance, you would think I’m just an average nineteen-year-old girl. There is nothing about me that stands out if you aren’t looking. I work in a family-run diner in Gwinn, Michigan. I go to the university here to study Zoology. I live by myself in a small two-story house at the edge of town. See plain and simple and until recently I would have completely agreed with you. My name is Alexandria, Lexie for short. And this is the story of where my life changes into a magical story you only see in movies or books.

It started on the first day of the snow season and the ground was already coated in a foot of fluffy white stuff and was steadily coming down. “ So this is light snow flurries,” I say to myself shaking my head. I pull my coat closer around me and get in my midnight blue nineteen ninety eight Chevy silverado.Don’t laugh, my dad bought it cheap for me when I got my license. We fixed up together to get it running like a dream. I toss my backpack in the passenger seat and start the truck hoping it will heat up quickly.

My work uniform was not designed for warmth. It is a red and white striped dress that goes to my knees. And flares at my waist showing off my hips and ass. A top that unfortunately shows too much cleavage for my taste. Add red pantyhose and white shoes and the outfit is complete. Add to the look my scarlet red hair pulled up in a ponytail and a white scarf. Honestly, I look like a five-foot-seven-inch candy cane and a fifties car hop merged. Yes, I’m tall but I have an abundance of curves that my uniform does nothing to hide. I have an hourglass figure that I’m damn proud of but the outfit shows off a bit much of it.

I think my boss has a thing for the fifties because the diner is the same way but hey it is a job. A job that pays the bills and works around my school schedule. Plus the people I work with are great and the customers are always nice and tip pretty well. I pull into the small parking lot across the street from the diner. Figures just as I started to warm up I have to get back out in the snow again. I grab my backpack, shove my keys in the pocket of my jacket and lock up. I walk as quickly as I can, without slipping and falling on my ass, to the diner.

The diner itself is a cute little L shaped place. Bright red booths line the outside walls and the front windows. Silver two-person tables with red Formica tops and silver chairs with red cushions are set in the middle between the booths and the counter. The counter takes up the rest of the front of the diner. The kitchen is behind the counter with a large rectangular window where we receive orders.Down the hall are bathrooms, locker room, as well as the office. The floor makes it all stand out with black and white checkered tiles. It has a fifties feel to it when you see the vintage records and old posters hanging on the walls.

“Hey, kiddo,” Patsy greets me with a warm smile from where she stands behind the counter. Patsy is a sweet lady in her mid-sixties I think, not that I would ever ask. She is a petite woman about five foot three inches with light brown hair that she always keeps in a tight bun. One of the best things about Patsy is no matter what time of day it is she is always in a good mood. I do enjoy working with her. “ How are you enjoying the first snow?” Patsy asks.

Shaking the snow from my hair and jacket I answer “ I don’t know if I will ever get used to it. I’m freezing. I have never been in snow before. I don’t know how to handle it. I’m from Florida for crying out loud.” Patsy just smiles. “ Don’t worry. I know you will be just fine. Just remember what I told you about layering up. Now get your butt over here and help me.” I put my backpack in the backroom and headed back to help Patsy.

“ Where do you want me to start?” I ask while Patsy puts on a fresh pot of coffee. “ Here, sip this while you get the silverware ready. She says when she hands me a cup of hot tea with honey. “ It should help warm you up.” she continues. I sit at the very end of the counter wrapping spoons, forks and knives together as I sip my tea. Patsy was right, it is warming me up. She grabs the salt shakers to refill them and sits next to me. The diner is empty so now is perfect for what Patsy calls girl time. Which is just her way of checking on me. She has been doing it since I moved here.

“ How’s school going? How do you like your classes?” she asks. “ It is going well. The professors are ok. The homework is a bit more than I expected so I have to study every chance I get to keep my grades up.” I say. “ Lexi, honey you can’t live your life in books. I know this is important to you but what about friends? Have you made any yet? I know you haven’t gone to any parties or on any dates.” I almost spit out the tea I just took a sip of and start coughing. I have to catch my breath to answer “ Patsy, I’m fine. I have been asked to join a few study groups. Parties aren’t my thing. And as for dates, I don’t have time. I am happy spending time with you and my books.” I told her.

For the most part, it is except for the dating part. I don’t date. I never have. I have been asked out a few times over the years and even a few times since I moved here but I always declined. Don’t get me wrong I want to date. But for some reason, my gut told me not to go. I have to wait. For what I don’t know. I have always trusted my instincts so I’m waiting. My mom used to call it my inner voice and I should pay attention. And I always have.

“ Oh, Lexi” Patsy starts as an elderly couple comes in and sits in her section. “ back to work but this conversation isn’t over,” she says and goes to greet her customers. When it comes to me I swear Patsy is like a dog with a bone. So I know she won’t let this go even though I wish she would. A steady stream of customers comes in, keeping us busy for a while. I for one am grateful for it. It makes the shift go by faster and I can avoid Patsy’s questions. I know her heart is in the right place but I don’t feel like discussing my love life especially for something I don’t understand myself. It isn’t as if I don’t want someone but I’m holding on to what my gut says. I feel it will be worth it in the end.

As quickly as everyone came in I swear they all left at the same time. Now it is just Patsy me and our cook. Patsy and I are clearing tables and cleaning up. “ Help me finish up and then you can take the back booth to study for a while,” Patsy says. I’m about to argue with her but before I can get my mouth open she continues “ If we get busy I’ll come to get you. The snow is coming down pretty good so I don’t think that we will get many people in if any at all.” I agree with her “ Ok, but I will lock up and you go home early for a change.” Patsy smiles big “ Kiddo, you have got yourself a deal.”

Patsy was right, we stayed empty while we finished our clean-up. I grabbed my backpack and went to the very last booth in the back so I would be out of the way in case any customers came in. I have my books spread out all over the table with my notebooks in front of me. I was so involved in my work I didn’t notice Patsy had brought me another cup of tea until she tapped me on the shoulder. “ Hey, drink up,” she says. “ How’s the homework going?” she asked. “ Not bad. I think I’m almost finished. And the best part is I think I understand most of it..” Patsy laughs “ I’m sure you understand more than you think. I know how smart you are even if you don’t. I know you graduated high school with honors.” “ High school was easy. This stuff, not so much.” I say. Patsy just squeezes me in support. “ I’ll leave you to it.” and she goes back to the counter to read her book. I envy her sometimes. I can’t remember the last time I read for fun.",1,1755168580.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Yesterday during a road trip in interior France I stopped at a highway rest area, which had a Starbucks.

In my best French (not terrible), I ordered a ""doppio espresso"", and then repeated ""double espresso"" just to make sure the barista understood.

The same barista who took my order then prepared my coffee (there were no other customers).

When I picked up the coffee it seemed heavy.  A double espresso is my regular order at Starbucks so I know the usual weight.

I looked on the side of the cup and in the shots box there was the number ""4"".

So upon ordering a ""double espresso"" I received four shots of espresso. 

Does anyone know if in France one shot of espresso is actually a double shot, whereas in the US the Starbucks baristas count each shot individually?

Im pretty new to the game and I’ve got myself a Sage Barista because I’ve wanted to get myself a better espresso set up. I know it’s not the Ferrari amongst espresso machines but from what I’ve read it’s a good start to gain some experience and, if dialed in well, it can deliver a pretty decent shot of espresso.

I’ve realised that a (by definition“ from what I’ve read, don’t know if it’s legit info) under-extracted shot tastes more to my liking with the setting and the beans I’ve got right now. I make two shots at a time and go in with 18g of coffee (Passalacqua cremadoro), and get an extraction of 30g in 30 seconds. Is that legit or should I change things? I’ve tried just extracting more: Higher acidity I’ve tried going coarser to have a quicker extraction: „Less taste“, highly prefer the taste after stopping the extraction at 30s at 30g of extraction.

Now to my question: Should I make sure I get around 35-40 grams of extraction in 25-30s or just keep thing the way they are if I like how the  shot tastes? Do you have general tips for me?

Thanks in advance! I’m keen hearing what experienced people have to say and how I can improve my shot 😊

I’m thinking, cool, let’s talk scope and budget. Then he drops the bomb, his max budget is 1000 INR. Yeah, you read that right 12 USD. For a whole damn website.

I almost choked on my coffee. I mean, I could build him an entire MVP CRM in like 2 weeks, with user auth, database integration, and a clean front-end. But $12? 

That’s not even enough to cover my electricity bill for those weeks, let alone the brainpower and code slinging. I politely explained that a project like this starts at a few hundred bucks minimum, even for a bare-bones version. 

He goes, “But my cousin’s friend did one for $10!” Bro, good luck with that Fiverr special then.

We talked for a minute or two, It's weird how smooth the conversation went considering that it was my first time doing such a thing.

Karne ka mann kiska nahi hota, par karna bhi padta hai. 
Ek chhotu si shuruaat hi sahi, hum dono ne ki hain. 
Shurvaat badi pyari thi, par zyada der tak nahi. 
Lockdown jo aaya tha, dur ko doori mein badalne. 
In-person ka toh pata nahi, par bye bhi theek se na bol sake. 

Dur reh kar yeh zaroor samjha ki, 
Instagram ke fake filters se zyada, 
Usse 80's-90's ke vintage se ishq hai. 

Jise jism se nahi, balki mere zulfon se ishq ho. 
Jise main sirf mini skirt mein hi nahi, 
Kurti ke libaas mein bhi pyari lagti ho. 

Jise mere labon ki ek pyari si muskaan dekhne ke liye, 
Mujhe milne ki talap rakhta ho. 
Casual dating ki iss duniya mein, 
Jise mere thande haath pakadne ka kabhi khauf na ho. 

Jise mere nakhre bhi pyare lagte ho, 
Jo meri chhatar-patar baaton par muskurata ho. 
Jo meri khushi mein hi nahi, 
Mere gham mein bhi saath khada ho. 

Jiske samne main apni baahon mein chhupe saare raaz khol sakun. 
Jo meri thandi zubaan se nikle aadhe-tedhe alfaaz ko, 
Tongue twister mein yaad rakhta ho, 
Aur mere gussane mein mujhe yaad dila kar hasta ho.

Jise Starbucks ki coffee se zyada, 
Tapri ki kulhad chai ka chaaska ho. 
Jise na meri commitment se darr lage, 
Na space maangne ki zarurat pade. 

Aur aise Instagram ke duniya mein, 
Story daalne wala nahi, sunne wala dhundhi hoon. 

""So-called special date"" pe nahi jaana, 
Balki jahan bhi haath pakad ke chalo, wahi date ban jaye. 
Jo best friend ke saath-saath, 
Mom-dad ka bhi role khub nibhaata hain. 

Jise mere naraz hone ka darr nahi, 
Par mere bichhad jaane ka khauf hain. 
Jo meri boli mein sangeet dhoonde, 
Aur sangeet mein pyar. 

""Aisa banda dhoondhi hoon"". 

Jo nakhre mere se kam hi karta hai, 
Par possessive bada sweet sound karta hai. 

Jise rangon se nahi, 
Rangon par parda dalne wale kaale rang se ishq hain. 
Jise meri ""perfect body with perfect smile"" se nahi, 
Meri imperfectly perfect aadat se ishq hain. 

Haan, mujhe bhi ishq hai tumse. 
Tumhari har ek banawat se ishq hai mujhe. 
Tum kahin saath na chhod do, 
Uska darr hai mujhe. 

Tumhe mere alawa apna maanne waalon se nafrat hai mujhe. 
Agar mohabbat karti hoon, toh naraz hone ka haq hai mujhe. 
Tumhari har ek baat se farq padta hai mujhe. 
Kaash tum mujhe pehle hi mil jaate...

Chickens…

 Almost Flightless fowl 

 They Fear not but the divine

Yet what are they to us

But something 

to dine?



Fecund friends 

Sent to find the rot beneath our feet

 We fund facists for cold water

To remove the worms that they see

Not knowing what it is they peck

Until it’s  far too late



So here we are

Feed in hand

Or should I say funds

Levied by oh,

Oh, so many guns


To subtract the coffee colored men

From our arms

From our homes

NO

From THEIR homes.

And for what?

Lies?

Lies which we have not seen 

Not with our own eyes

So while we may hold the funds

who holds the feed?

1mpwwtt,https://i.redd.it/rp6u22ycqyif1.png,"Betrayed by Alpha, Stronger Than Ever. Where can I find a free link to read this story?","# Chapter 1

At two in the morning, a call from my Alpha mate Merrick Thorne jolted me awake.



His voice was low and hoarse, tinged with panic. ""Lina, something's happened.""



I froze. ""Aren't you on a business trip? What's wrong?""



He paused for a long moment, as if struggling to find the words. ""Liliane... she's pregnant. Five months along.""



My mind exploded with a thunderous crash. ""You two?""



""No,"" he immediately explained. ""We never had any kind of relationship.""



I hadn't even had time to feel relieved when Merrick continued, ""The healer just contacted me. She collapsed, and I'm listed as her emergency contact. She's still in the ER.""



When I arrived, the healer had just emerged. Thankfully, it was a false alarm. ""The fetus is stable. We suspect the fainting was caused by malnutrition.""



Merrick leaned against the wall, his voice barely a whisper, as if his throat was blocked. ""She did something foolish. She used my sperm.""



""What?"" I whipped around, utterly shocked.



Merrick explained, ""Remember that joint experiment I participated in with Sablecourt Pack in Calverin a few years ago? We all provided samples for genetic screening research. She... took mine. She said she didn't want status or money. She just wanted to give me a child. She knew you couldn't have children. She knew I actually... really wanted one.""



My head buzzed, and I couldn't tell if what I felt was anger or absurdity.



This was the most hidden, most silent crack in our mate bond—something we tacitly never discussed.



And now, it was an outsider who had inserted herself using this method.



For a moment, my mind flashed through so many emotions—the fury of being betrayed by my mate, anger, sadness...



It felt like a thousand words were waiting for me to scream them in hysterical accusation.



""The patient is awake."" The healer's interruption stopped the volcanic eruption.



In the ward, Liliane slowly opened her eyes. The first person she saw was me.



She struggled to sit up, her hands trembling as she grabbed my arm, her voice hoarse but determined. ""Luna, I never intended to have any future with Alpha from the beginning. I know I have no right, but I want to give him a pup and complete your family. Please let me have this pup.""



I stood there, looking at her haggard but stubborn eyes, feeling like I couldn't breathe.



Merrick stood behind me, his voice low. ""Lina, the pup is innocent. So is she.""



I let out a bitter laugh. ""Merrick, you waited five months to tell me. You really know how to manipulate me.""



He remained silent.



I had known for a long time that Liliane was different from others.



Her warrior father had died fighting for Silvermoon Pack. Since she was entrusted to Merrick at nineteen, she had always lingered on the edges of our lives.



Over the years, Merrick not only paid for her education and took care of her living expenses, but he also housed her in an apartment just three subway stops from our home, often personally picking her up and dropping her off.



Liliane never hid her feelings.



Those so-called ""coincidences""—late-night texts asking for help, showing up at our door in thin clothing claiming her pipes had burst, conveniently falling ill when I was away on business trips and needing his care...



She grew bolder each time.



Unfortunately, Merrick never truly had the heart to refuse her.



He would keep a cold face and say it was ""inappropriate,"" but he never really cut ties.



Merrick said, ""Her father died for Silvermoon Pack. She's alone and helpless. I can't be too heartless.""



He thought he was being clear enough, but he didn't understand.



For a woman who had harbored feelings for him for so long, as long as he left any opening, it was enough to weave fantasies.



I nodded. ""The pup has nothing to do with me. If you want to have it, go ahead.""

# Chapter 2

My mind was in chaos, but I wasn't just the Luna of Silvermoon Pack—I was also a scientific researcher.



I happened to have a project that required travel during this period.



By the time I returned, the pup had been born—a baby boy.



I stood at the hospital room doorway, hearing laughter from within.



Merrick had once said, ""In this world, you're the one I care about most.""



But at this moment, he was carefully lifting the swaddled pup, his voice tender. ""Don't cry, Daddy's little darling. Daddy loves you most in this whole world.""



Liliane was flipping through a parenting handbook. ""This pup has your nose, but his eyes look like mine.""



Merrick agreed, ""Yes, let's call him Evren Thorne. He'll be the future Alpha heir of Silvermoon Pack.""



I stood right there in the doorway, but neither of them noticed me.



I couldn't help but clear my throat softly.



Merrick looked up, his gaze settling on me. In that instant, his smile abruptly faded. ""Lina.""



I walked in, and the room fell silent.



Liliane looked at me pitifully and said, ""Lina, if you don't like me, I'll raise the child myself. He won't step foot in the pack house.""



She had called me Luna before, but now she was calling me Lina.



Previously, she said she'd give me the pup after birth, but now it became her raising him alone.



I smiled. ""Liliane, I didn't realize you were so considerate of me.""



Her eyes reddened. ""I know Alpha has always wanted a child. I wanted to fulfill that wish for you.""



I stared at her and threw the documents in my hand onto her bed. ""Legal consequences for unauthorized use of genetic material. You have a scientific background. I don't believe you didn't know this was illegal.""



Her face went pale, her lips trembling.



Suddenly, the pup burst into loud cries.



Merrick immediately held him close, soothing him in low tones.



In that moment, I suddenly realized that regardless of who was right or wrong, this pup would forever stand between us.



I turned to leave, but Merrick caught the hem of my shirt. ""Lina! Thank you for not pursuing this, but there's something else I need to discuss with you. Liliane just gave birth and her recovery is slow. The healer recommends continued rest. Crescent Grove has good sunlight and complete facilities... After she's discharged, could she temporarily stay there? I could take care of her...""



My throat tightened, and I almost bit out the words, ""Live in our house?""



""She has no other family."" When he said this, his eyes were as clear and calm as always. ""Lina, she just needs some help.""



I looked at Merrick, my throat feeling like it was stuffed with cotton, making it hard to breathe.



""What about me?"" I asked softly, ""If you bring her home, what about me? Do I have to live under the same roof as her?""



Merrick suggested, ""If you really find it inappropriate... you could move to Easton Manor for now. It's farther from the research center, but quieter.""



So that was it. I smiled bitterly and turned to leave.



At this point, I needed to consider whether this mate bond was worth maintaining.



I met Merrick ten years ago at a thesis defense.



I had just returned to Silvermoon Pack, and he attended as a special guest, sitting in the back row, his suit impeccable, even his cufflinks fastened perfectly.



Most people asked polite, official questions, but he directly targeted the weakest point in my logical reasoning. ""I've read your previous paper published in JNS. Your proof abilities are solid.""



In that moment, I had a strange feeling—he wasn't trying to undermine me, but to remind me not to let habitual thinking drag me down.



The mind link formed in that instant.



Everything that followed was natural.



My soul fell in love with him after we shared a particularly ordinary meal.



That day, we had argued endlessly over work, and he suddenly fell silent for a long time before taking me to a small noodle shop behind the school.



A tiny table, we hadn't eaten properly.



He picked the chili peppers out of my bowl and wiped soup splashes off my sleeve with a napkin.



He said, ""Lina, your edge is a good thing. But not every battle needs to be won. People need to save their strength for more important things.""



Looking at him then, I suddenly understood—I would become this man's mate.



But now, I couldn't understand where things had gone wrong.



If it was about pup, then he was the one who owed me.

# Chapter 3

The year we first formed our mate bond, we encountered an accident during a trip.



Instinctively, I shielded him. When that blade came down, I only felt heat in my abdomen, like something was tearing me apart.



He was the one who carried me into the pack hospital, the one who knelt outside the emergency room, pounding his chest and crying until his voice was raw.



That night, his whole body trembled as he gripped my hand repeatedly, saying, ""Lina, I'm sorry. I swear, in this lifetime, having you as my only treasure is enough.""



He spoke so sincerely, cried so heartbreakingly.



After that, I truly never brought up pup again.



But Liliane had given birth to his child.



I typed a message on my phone: \[Merrick, I want to break our mate bond.\]



Less than half an hour later, the doorbell rang.



Merrick burst through the door, travel-worn. ""Lina, don't be impulsive.""



I didn't turn around, just put my phone back on the coffee table. ""It's not impulsive. It's long-overdue clarity.""



He walked over and sat in the single chair across from me, silent for a long time. ""She needs time to recover. We agreed that after a month, I'll give her money and send her to Calverin. The pup will stay home, and she'll never come back.""



I laughed. ""Merrick, do you really think you've done nothing wrong?""



He froze.



I looked at him, enunciating each word, ""You knew she coveted you, knew she stole your sperm to get pregnant, yet you still gave her hope. You not only indulged her feelings for you but also stayed by her side during delivery. Now you're willing to send her away?""



He apologized, ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault. But Lina, the child is already born. This is a life—we can't abandon him.""



""What about me?"" I lost control and raised my voice. ""Have you thought about me? Don't you know why I can't have children? Don't I deserve to be protected?""



His Adam's apple bobbed, but he said nothing.



I looked at him, my eyes stinging. ""You said she was too weak and needed proper rest. Fine, we could spend money on a hospital or a good postpartum center, or find a nice hotel and hire several nannies. But you refused. She said she only trusted you, and you surrendered, giving up our home and throwing me out. Search your heart—do you really want a child, or do you want to take care of them, mother and son?""



He stared at me, silent to the point of harshness.



Then his phone rang.



He glanced at the screen, hesitated, but still answered.



""Merrick, I feel dizzy, and my wound has reopened. Could you come over?"" It was Liliane's voice, filled with grievance and vulnerability.



Merrick was silent for a few seconds, looking at me, then down at his phone, as if making a difficult decision. ""Lina, let me go check on her first. She just gave birth.""



I said nothing, just watched him stand and leave hurriedly.



The moment the door closed, I smiled softly.



No matter how much I cried or pleaded, it couldn't compare to one phone call from Liliane.



I knew he might never marry Liliane.



But he would be needed by her again and again, have his life disrupted by her again and again.



How much longer could I endure such days if I didn't break the mate bond? Three months? Three years? A lifetime?



I contacted a lawyer to draft the mating bond dissolution papers.



When I woke up again, my phone was ringing incessantly.



""Lina!"" Merrick's voice roared through the phone. ""If you have a problem, come to me!""



Before I could speak, he continued angrily, ""Why did you send Liliane those emails reporting her for stealing from the genetic bank? Her postpartum depression is already severe enough! Do you have to drive her to death?""



I was stunned.



I'd never sent those emails, but he convicted me without question—the first time my mate had ever yelled at me.



He shouted, ""Lina, the healer says her postpartum emotions are very unstable. If we hadn't discovered it early last night, she would have committed suicide! A living person—can't you show some compassion?""



I answered, ""Whether you believe it or not, I didn't do it, and I wouldn't stoop to such methods.""



""Lina, regardless, please—when she's discharged, come see her and apologize. Just for my sake. If you come, she'll be able to let go of her psychological burden..."" The man on the phone seemed to be crying, his voice trembling.



I wiped away the tears that had fallen and finally nodded. ""Alright.""



There would be no apology, but our relationship did need closure.

# Chapter 4

I arrived at the hospital as promised.



When Merrick saw me, he nodded. ""Lina, thank you for coming.""



When Liliane saw it was me, she suddenly became emotional, her eyes immediately reddening as she struggled to get up. ""Lina, please don't report me. I can't bear to leave my child. Please give us mother and son a little more time...""



As she spoke, she tremblingly knelt down before me.



The healer was frightened and quickly held her down. ""You just had a C-section—you can't kneel!""



Jenna hurried to support her, her tone reproachful. ""Lina, why have you become so cold?""



People around us stared, and I stood there having done nothing, yet I became the cold-blooded, vindictive villain.



Fortunately, Merrick still had some dignity and brought me to the car first.



When getting in, Liliane seemed to want to ease the tension.



She handed me the baby. ""Lina, hold him for a bit. The little one has been especially good today.""



Before I could agree, the child was placed in my arms.



He really was soft and sweet.



My heart softened for a moment.



But before the car had even left the hospital gates, the baby in my arms began to squirm, then let out a series of sharp cries.



""What's wrong?""



Liliane's expression changed, and she said tearfully, ""He's breaking out in a rash. Is he having another allergic reaction? The healer said the baby is allergic to perfume. Jenna gave him a rash a few days ago that just went away.""



""Hey, don't blame me. I didn't do anything,"" Jenna quickly defended herself.



Only me.



Merrick glanced at me, his expression displeased. ""Lina, are you wearing perfume?""



Before I could say anything, the baby's cries became more piercing, and dense red spots appeared on his face.



""Stop the car!"" Liliane shouted anxiously.



Merrick yanked the steering wheel and rushed into the hospital emergency lane.



As he got out with the baby, he lowered his voice and cursed, ""Acting like a wicked stepmother before you even are one. You really disappoint me!""



My hands trembled and I nearly collapsed in the bone-chillingly cold hospital corridor, standing there like a shell with its soul sucked out.



Jenna's eyes were full of disgust. ""How has Merrick wronged you? He never even cheated, and now you can't even tolerate a pup. You're too vicious.""



I kept my head down, saying nothing.



Merrick finally appeared. ""The healer says the child is out of danger.""



I looked at him, trying to explain, ""I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't know.""



But he wouldn't listen, immediately cutting me off.



His gaze held unfamiliar judgment. ""Lina, you've become someone I don't recognize—cold-blooded.""



I clutched the documents in my hand, my heart feeling like it was stuffed with a thousand-pound boulder.



Finally, with a trembling voice, I handed them over. ""Fine, I'll compensate you with a happy family. Merrick, let's... break the mate bond.""



He froze, then his eyes darkened, but he said nothing.



I didn't dare look at him again, afraid I might really break down and cry.



""Merrick."" Liliane appeared weakly at the ward door, her steps unsteady. ""Lina, if you're angry, take it out on me. Why hurt my child?""



Onlooking family members and nurses turned to stare, whispering among themselves.



""Is that the woman who made the child allergic and hospitalized?""



""She looks quite refined. How could she do such a thing?""



I opened my mouth but couldn't make a sound.



Merrick quickly walked over to support her, holding her protectively in his arms, his expression panicked. ""Your health is what matters.""



He turned back to look at me, his eyes cold as blades. ""Lina, come apologize to Liliane! Otherwise...""



I stuffed that crumpled paper into his hands. ""Otherwise, isn't this it?""



He looked down at it briefly, his lips pressed thin, but he still took it. ""Jealousy has made you lose your rationality. Separating for a while so you can calm down might be good.""



I laughed, but tears fell. ""Since you've already decided, don't ask me anymore.""



I turned and left, my steps unsteady, each one like walking on knife points.",1,1755167636.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1mpwufs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpwufs,Help me figure out the wall behind my couch!,"I took some suggestions from a post i made last month, and you guys said move the tv to the smaller half wall, which i did and i love it. It flows so much better now. But i am still struggling on what to do on the large wall behind the couch. I left about a 12 -15” space behind couch for a sofa table but im stuck because im not sure its what i should do and am looking for ideas. The couch is not quite centered - because when it’s centered, there’s about 6” of space on either side only. 

I have a circle coffee table that i am likely buying. Maybe an end table at the chaise end of the couch? I’m definitely planning to add plants, but where? Maybe two straight up floor lamps in either corner? I tried an arched lamp and it was a fail. And will hang curtains but one half of them would be hiding behind the couch. And definitely adding lots of pillows that pull in colors from the rug! I’m thinking a gallery wall behind the couch? Send ideas my way!!! Decision paralysis is real.

1mpwtet,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mpwtet,Shell Helix Car Doctor in Fairview - an honest review,"Just had my PMS (Preventive Maintenance Service) done at the newly opened Shell Helix Car Doctor in Fairview, and I wanted to share my honest review. As a regular Shell customer, I was excited to try this new branch. The freebies and inclusions were definitely a plus! However, I noticed a few areas for improvement.

On the bright side, the staff (shoutout to Kuya!) were super friendly and helpful. The lounge was comfy, and the free snacks and coffee were good! though heads up, no WiFi available.

Now, for the not-so-good stuff. Compared to other Shell branches I've visited, this one didn't provide a Service Summary Report detailing what was done during the PMS. It felt like they just changed the oil, and I wasn't sure if the free checks were actually performed since there was no documentation. I brought this up with the page, and they mentioned they're not yet integrated with Shell's system (but a simple summary report shouldn't require that) It's just standard practice, right? As a result, I had to constantly ask the staff about the status of certain tasks.

Another issue was that they couldn't clean my cabin filter because they didn't know where it was located. There was no points as well for shell members or unionbank shell card owners. Lastly, their receipt was so plain. It does not have any details of oils or itemization.

Overall, the service was decent, but I'm sure there are better car services out there that'll give you and your ride the TLC it deserves.

1mpws8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1mpws8o/spent_a_month_in_a_household_with_a_2_year_old/,Spent a month in a household with a 2 year old,"Let me just say that I’m not fully sure if I want to be childless but this experience has definitely tipped the scales into the “Childfree lifestyle”

Our friends hosted us (My Wife and I) and they have a two year old- at first it was alright but after the first week I was getting annoyed. 
I'm not one to tell people how to raise their child but my god I wish someone would tell my friends how to. 

1) They're permissive parents so punishment or discipline is almost non-existent and when there is, they quickly give into the kid, teaching her that “No” really means “Yes!” if you keep screaming and stomping. 

2) There are toys everywhere. Now I understand that kids make a mess but they haven't taught her to even try picking up so we have been picking up her and their messes. 

3) Saying “No” to her in public leads to embarrassment. This kid hates hearing no and will not tolerate an utterance of “No” in her presence- if she does, prepare to deal with screaming, throwing herself on the ground and running. 

4) As I mentioned last on #3, she's a runner.. I've had to chase this child into traffic, through a busy mall, at the beach, into deep water at the beach, into stores, into people, etc. She thinks it's a game and if you grab her, she will scream and cry. Also she will shriek if you hold her hand to prevent her from running. 

5) Anytime me and my partner wanted to go out- here comes grandma and the baby to join us! I only had one “date” if you could call 1 hour alone in public as a date. 

6) This kid won't eat. Apparently she hates eating and will only eat if it's snacks so many meal times were full of shrieking because god forbid her parents give her something that isn't cookies or bread (or milk). 

7) Any private time I could have with wifey was at times interrupted by a door opening and a half naked baby coming into play with my stuff on the nightstand. Every night was spent dressed in pjs during 80+ degree nights because the baby might open our door and walk in and I don't her to see two half-naked adults. 

8) Going to the store meant we had to get something for the baby (usually candy) or she would get mad if she didn't get a treat. 

9) Bedtime is her mortal enemy so like clockwork- 12am every night is a shriek fest that can only be silenced with her 4th/ 5th sippy cup of milk. 

10) Going to the store without her? Not on her watch. She shrieks if someone leaves the house without her or even opens the door and puts the baby gate up so she can't escape. 


I'm sure there's things I forgot and missed but overall- I'm done and want to go home. I don't hate her but this experience has truly opened my eyes a bit and put the “I want a baby” thoughts on hold. 
I don't hate my friends either but if they don't put an end to this “permissive parenting” bs then they will have an 8-year-old with the emotional maturity of a 4-year-old old. 
Discipline does not equal beating a child but they're acting like it is. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that this child shrieks and cries 10+ a day. Imagine waking up, enjoying your coffee, and then hearing shrieking until it's time for you to retire to your room. ",1,1755167217.0,childfree,11,0.56,False
