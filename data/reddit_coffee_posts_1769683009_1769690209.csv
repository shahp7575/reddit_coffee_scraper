I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on introspection, curiosity, and passionate drives.

I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure and adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes within you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.",1,1769690042.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1qq7c62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/1qq7c62/small_win/,Small win,"Just wanted to share a small win. Recently turned 38. I’m in an LDR, and my boyfriend came to town to celebrate. Over the past year I’ve been in a cycle of restricting and overexercising to get as small as possible before seeing my boyfriend and then letting myself be “normal” with him (although more and more, the anxiety of breaking routine and “undoing” all of my “hard work” was starting to impact me during our visits). He was here for an extended time, and I didn’t weigh myself or my food. I had alcohol and went out to eat a couple of times. I exercised, but for less time and took rest days to maximize time spent together. I took the opportunity to practice intuitive eating, challenge restriction impulses, cook with the amount of oil that actually makes food taste good, etc. I even had a piece of the cake they got for me at work (huge for me). 

I had moments of stress and insecurity (especially drinking alcohol and not measuring things like peanut butter or the milk in my coffee), but I was also able to observe how much more energy I have and how much mental space tracking actually takes up in my brain and day. 

The day after he left, I did weigh myself (not the best idea), and the impact was so minimal despite being SO off my routine. I made the decision to continue my break from tracking and see what happens. At least for today. Part of my motivation is that I have a medical procedure coming up this weekend, and it’s probably better to go into it well nourished.

I don’t know how long this will last, but I’m relieved that it feels more possible for now. It has been feeling a bit dicey lately, and any time I can break through the haze gives me a positive reference point to return do if I backtrack. ",1,1769690004.0,Eatingdisordersover30,0,1.0,False

1qq7b95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stockholm/comments/1qq7b95/law_graduate_transitioning_into_software/,Law Graduate Transitioning into Software Development — Seeking Guidance for Opportunities Abroad,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 26-year-old from Meknes, Morocco. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Legal Sciences (Private Law) from Moulay Ismail University.

During my academic journey, I completed several short internships: one month in a local municipality, one month in court, and one month working with a lawyer. After graduation, I initially waited to take public sector recruitment exams, which is a common path for law graduates in my country.

 However, available positions were very limited, and exam dates were often distant and uncertain.

Rather than remaining idle, I chose to take responsibility for my life and work in any honest job that would allow me to support myself. 

By coincidence, I applied to a coffee company in Casablanca, where I was hired and worked for about seven months as both a sales assistant and a barista.

Later, I returned to my hometown and decided to reorient my career toward technology. I passed an interview and was accepted into a software development training program focused on programming and practical skills, offered as part of a national initiative related to digital transformation. I am currently in the final stage of this program and fully committed to learning and improving step by step.

In parallel, I am actively working on improving my language skills. Arabic is my native language, which I speak fluently, and I am continuously developing my English and French, as they are essential for professional and international environments.

My long-term dream is to find professional opportunities abroad, based on skills, effort, and merit — not sympathy. I come from a country with a rich Arab, African, and Islamic identity, and at the same time I deeply respect all cultures, religions, and personal freedoms. 

I value openness, coexistence, and mutual respect, and I aim to grow both professionally and personally through honest work and responsibility.

I’m not asking for job offers directly, but for guidance and perspective to help me navigate opportunities abroad:

What steps should I take to move from a beginner in software development to a junior role internationally?

Are there realistic programs or pathways for international applicants at entry level?

What skills, projects, or certifications should I prioritize to improve my chances of finding work abroad?

1qq75ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1qq75ml/a_tshirt_appears/,A t-shirt appears.,"Hello all,

So I was recently about to do my morning weight session (at home) and before I began I was looking around for the T-shirt I usually wear when exercising. It was an oversized grey tee. Which I usually leave on my weight bench amongst some other garments I usually wear daily. When I began to look around the area it didn’t appear to be where I leave it. So I left the room and checked the drawers in my bedroom (it had recently been washed so could have landed in a clothes draw) I looked in all the drawers and it wasn’t there. At this point I figured oh well I’ll just carry on with my routine. 

I returned to the lounge where my weight bench is and bundled up the articles of clothing on my weight bench into my arms and moved them all on to a nearby coffee table where they live for the duration of my workout. 

I walked backed to the weight bench and made a start on my routine which typically involves some dumbbell workouts  which are performed whilst standing directly in front of the weight bench, and facing towards it, as there is a mirror mounted directly behind the head of the bench which I use to keep an eye on form. 

I had been in front of my weight bench working out for roughly 10-15 minutes when I noticed the grey T-shirt placed perfectly on the weight bench toward the edge closest to me, folded neatly. Like it was there all along. 

  
This was very strange to me, because as I had said previously I had removed every article of clothing from the bench to clear it before starting my routine, and I had not seen it amongst them, I distinctly recall looking at the bench and seeing nothing on it, I also did not leave the room when I started my routine and nobody was in the house but myself. 

I also didn’t move from the front of the bench during that initial part of my routine. 

  
Guys it honestly felt like the shirt materialised from thin air and appeared on the bench. I don’t see how I could have been stood in front of it for maybe 15 minutes and not seen it. I was picking up and putting down weights maybe 2 foot in front of the bench and was frequently at eye level to the place it appeared.

  
I can’t word it, but when I saw it. Things felt weird. Like the energy was off for a small amount of time.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Jet lag, cultural shock, and endless to-do lists made me question everything. But looking back after settling in, I realise the things that actually mattered weren't complicated, they just needed intention. Here's what I wish I'd known before arriving.

**Start with the Basics: Accommodation and Orientation**

The first thing you need isn't an Instagram-worthy experience; it's a safe, comfortable place to land. Your accommodation sets the tone for everything else. I wasted weeks in inadequate housing before discovering @**UniversityLiving** which helped me find proper student accommodation with transparent reviews and actual photos. Honest housing information removes so much stress from an already hectic transition. Next, attend your orientation. I know it seems boring, but these sessions are gold mines of practical information on services, procedures, and connections you'll desperately need later.

**Create a Practical Checklist of ""Adult Tasks"":**

Don't feel lost by trying to remember everything. Write down what you need to accomplish: opening a bank account, getting a local SIM card, figuring out public transportation, registering with your university, and understanding your country's grading system. Checking items off this list gives you purpose and momentum during the disorienting first weeks. Each small victory builds confidence.

**Prioritise Sleep and Rest Over FOMO:**

Here's what nobody tells you: you need more sleep than usual when adjusting to a new country. Your brain is working overtime processing everything. Jet lag is real, and fighting it only makes things worse. Give yourself permission to rest without guilt. You're not missing out, you're actually investing in your ability to enjoy the experience.

**Find Your People Early:**

Loneliness hits hardest when you haven't built connections. Attend welcome events, join a club or society, even one that seems random, and say yes to coffee invitations. Building a support network early isn't optional; it's essential. These friendships become your lifeline when homesickness creeps in.

**Balance Academics with Exploration Thoughtfully:**

Don't fall into the trap of exploring every weekend while neglecting your studies. The pressure to travel constantly is real, but falling behind academically creates stress that ruins the whole experience. Instead, spend your first month really getting to know your host city. Slow down. Master public transport. Find your favourite café. The deeper knowledge comes from living somewhere, not just passing through.

**Embrace Discomfort as Part of the Process:**

You will make mistakes speaking the language. You'll get lost. You'll feel awkward at social events. This isn't failure, it's literally how you learn. Everyone around you is experiencing the same disorientation. Be kind to yourself through these moments.

**Manage Expectations Around Culture Shock:**

Anticipate that after the initial excitement fades, cultural differences might frustrate you. This is normal, not a sign that coming abroad was wrong. Establish routines, exercise, hobbies, and self-care rituals that help you stay grounded when things feel overwhelming.

Finally, stop comparing your journey to others'. Everyone's study abroad story looks different. Don't waste limited time doing things you don't want to do or being around people you're uncomfortable with. Your experience should reflect your values, not someone else's Instagram feed.

The beginning is disorienting, but it gets better faster than you expect. Trust the process",1,1769689286.0,AbroadEdge,0,1.0,False

1qq71ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1qq71ss/law_graduate_transitioning_into_software/,Law Graduate Transitioning into Software Development — Seeking Guidance for Opportunities Abroad,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 26-year-old from Meknes, Morocco. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Legal Sciences (Private Law) from Moulay Ismail University.

During my academic journey, I completed several short internships: one month in a local municipality, one month in court, and one month working with a lawyer. After graduation, I initially waited to take public sector recruitment exams, which is a common path for law graduates in my country.

 However, available positions were very limited, and exam dates were often distant and uncertain.

Rather than remaining idle, I chose to take responsibility for my life and work in any honest job that would allow me to support myself. By coincidence, I applied to a coffee company in Casablanca, where I was hired and worked for about seven months as both a sales assistant and a barista.

Later, I returned to my hometown and decided to reorient my career toward technology. I passed an interview and was accepted into a software development training program focused on programming and practical skills, offered as part of a national initiative related to digital transformation. I am currently in the final stage of this program and fully committed to learning and improving step by step.

In parallel, I am actively working on improving my language skills. Arabic is my native language, which I speak fluently, and I am continuously developing my English and French, as they are essential for professional and international environments.

My long-term dream is to find professional opportunities abroad, based on skills, effort, and merit — not sympathy. I come from a country with a rich Arab, African, and Islamic identity, and at the same time I deeply respect all cultures, religions, and personal freedoms. I value openness, coexistence, and mutual respect, and I aim to grow both professionally and personally through honest work and responsibility.

I’m not asking for job offers directly, but for guidance and perspective to help me navigate opportunities abroad:

What steps should I take to move from a beginner in software development to a junior role internationally?

Are there realistic programs or pathways for international applicants at entry level?

What skills, projects, or certifications should I prioritize to improve my chances of finding work abroad?

Thank you for taking the time to read. I sincerely hope this post will be received with understanding and respect.",1,1769689147.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

1qq70ww,https://i.redd.it/xe9e4a776agg1.jpeg,The Birth and Meaning of the Zuireia Flow,"The name Zuireia Flow was originally conceived as a way to unite the philosophy of intoxication with design and art. At that time, the philosophy of Yoǔ (酉) had not yet fully taken form; it was still in its earliest, embryonic stage. The original focus was therefore not on Yoǔ, but on intoxication itself — rooted in the Dionysian spirit.

Yet the philosophy of Yoǔ ultimately emerged as an extension of the Dionysian spirit. From the Dionysian refusal to deny the ugliness and suffering of reality, this line of thought evolved into a deeper stance of inclusivity and acceptance. All things are contained within Yoǔ. Yoǔ is the space in which all meaning is permitted to exist.

Today, Zuireia Flow is no longer merely a space for design and art. It has become, in essence, a field of development across all domains, with Yoǔ philosophy as its core — a kind of academy of thought. In its earliest stage, before this academy existed, the scope of thinking was extremely limited. In truth, philosophy was never part of the original plan. The initial intention was simply to study alcohol itself: how to make flavors smoother, more aromatic, and how to refine different brewing techniques.

As time passed, the field of vision expanded. The objects of study began to connect with other disciplines. It began with other beverages — coffee and tea. Gradually, it moved beyond drinks and into cooking techniques, touching the domain of food. Soon after came cigars, hookah, and cigarettes. Then came the encounter with Nietzsche’s Dionysian spirit, which shifted the core focus from alcohol itself to intoxication as a state. This was followed by engagement with Drunken Boxing in Chinese culture.

At this point, it became clear that this was no longer about alcohol alone. What appeared was an entire systemic structure, branching outward from a central core and connecting with many different fields — like water spreading and flowing. From then on, the object of study was no longer merely alcohol, but that central core itself. But what was this core? The answer pointed back toward philosophy, for this was the origin of all connections: thought itself. Zuireia Flow thus became the practice of this thought, and its concrete manifestation within a systemic structure.

The logo places a bowl at the center, encircled by a ring. This is because the bowl is the most direct and representative symbol of a container. The bowl echoes the most primitive human gesture of gathering water from a river with cupped hands. In this sense, the bowl represents the inner Yoǔ of the human being, while the outer circle represents the Yoǔ of the world.

This abstract representation arises because the concept has moved into the invisible and metaphysical realm. It concerns metaphysics itself, and therefore the simpler and more abstract the form, the more clearly it can express the concept. The brush-like lines are used to convey a sense of intoxication. The distinction between black and white reflects a duality between matter and psyche — not as opposition, but as complementarity. Black, in pigment, is the mixture of all colors. White, in light, is the union of all wavelengths. Pigment resembles the material world, while light resembles the radiance of the human mind and spirit. For this reason, the symbol is rendered in white lines, signifying that it is a creation born from human thought.",1,1769689074.0,u_ZuireiaFlow,0,1.0,False

I usually work 8 hour shifts and am therefore given half an hour break each day. During this break we are encouraged to make a coffee, grab any drink from the fridge, make a smoothie and MAKE LUNCH. 

I know this is such a stupid thing to ask for advice on but I really don’t know how? When the older girls go on break who have worked there a few years they just go into the kitchen and make a toastie or a burger, something hot, a side of chips maybe. I’ve only worked there a month and this weekend I will work my first shift without my boss. 

usually she will tell me to make lunch and because I’m so nervous to say ‘I don’t really know my way around the kitchen and have no idea how to make anything’ I just feign ‘I’m not hungry’ and ‘I’m not sure’ until she randomly comes out with a toastie and says to try it. I don’t know if we can take food from the front display fridge like sausage rolls to cook or even where the bread or butter is kept, the onky time I’m ever in the kitchen is when I walk through in the morning to get in.

  
i know this is such a silly thing to need advice on, i mean? just go in the kitchen and sus it out and say ‘what should I make, how would I make that?’ but I’m such a shy person and all the girls I’ll be working with on the weekends are what I would consider those girls that work with your but don’t ever really work with you, they are the girls I don’t really get along with and are really awkward and I’m just not sure what i should do? just go back there and hope for the best?",1,1769688991.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Carlos Ghosn speaks on Japan’s ‘corrupt’ justice system and his daring escape

By Tokyo Reporter Staff on August 10, 2025

Former Nissan CEO [Carlos Ghosn](https://www.tokyoreporter.com/japan-news/special-reports/before-ghosn-unsolved-boac-stewardess-murder-of-1959/) sits down with journalist Hiroshi Sukagawa in Beirut, Lebanon to discuss Japan’s “corrupt” justice system and his escape. A summarized version is below.  
**Interviewer (Sukagawa):** Thank you for joining us today. Beirut’s weather is quite pleasant compared to Japan.  
**Carlos Ghosn:** Yes, about 30°C — nothing compared to Japan’s heat. Much more comfortable here.

**Interviewer:** We’re not here for a personal profile, but to examine in depth what happened on the day of your escape from Japan, and your views on Nissan. You’re known as the legendary CEO who turned Nissan from billions in debt into a profitable company. How do you view Nissan today, and how do you respond to being called a fugitive and the drama of your escape?  
**Ghosn:** Many questions there. Let’s start with November 2018. My arrest was planned. It’s absurd for the head of a major global company, also representing a major French corporation, to be arrested over unreported compensation—amounts neither decided, paid, nor finalized. In normal corporate governance, issues are handled internally with prosecutors, correcting problems without damaging the company. Hurting Nissan damages Japan—its employees, shareholders, and reputation. Even former Prime Minister Abe said I shouldn’t have been involved in this. The board could have dealt with it internally, but they couldn’t remove me via the board or shareholders, so they used legal means.

If a CEO is suspected of abusing systems, the proper course is to suspend them. But here, the aim was to completely neutralize me, remove me from the system, and eliminate the risk that Nissan might fall under Renault and the French government’s influence. Anyone can see the charges were not the real reason for my arrest.

After my arrest I investigated and found it was orchestrated. Prosecutors in Japan have a 99.4 percent conviction rate, not because of plea deals, but because they coerce confessions. Once indicted, it’s essentially over—lawyers and judges are irrelevant. They pressured me: confess and things will be easier; we won’t go after your wife, children, or friends. That’s recorded, but the tapes are withheld “for containing sensitive information.” The system is corrupt.

They split charges to extend detention — 21 days for one charge, then another 21 days for new charges, threatening more if I didn’t confess. I never confessed, so they re-arrested me. International pressure finally forced them to grant bail—at $15 million, the highest in Japan. Yet I was under extreme restrictions, surveilled by cameras Nissan paid for, which was likely illegal. This convinced me I’d never get a fair trial. Staying meant 10–15 years in legal limbo, possibly re-arrested. At 64, that meant dying in that process. So I planned my escape—something prosecutors would never expect, as no one had done it before.

For a year, prosecutors controlled the narrative: “Ghosn is greedy, loves money, committed major crimes.” I couldn’t speak to any media. When I reached Lebanon, I was free to respond. People call me a fugitive; I say I fled injustice. I’m not hiding—everyone knows where I live — but Japan issued Interpol notices for me and my wife, on absurd charges, purely to pressure me.

**Interviewer:** You’ve said there were “rotten apples” inside Nissan. Why did they want you out?  
**Ghosn:** They feared that if I finalized the holding company structure for Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, it would cement the alliance and prevent Japan from ever undoing it. I opposed a full merger—politicians liked it, but I preferred a fair holding company with no single controlling party. The French government wanted a merger, which worried some in Japan. Removing me was the way to collapse the alliance—which indeed happened.

Now Nissan and Mitsubishi are in trouble. They even tried talks with Honda, which I predicted would fail—no synergies. Both have the same strengths and weaknesses; mergers work when they’re complementary.

Renault’s then-chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, failed in his role. He sat on Nissan’s board, knew the issues, approved budgets, and oversaw decisions that led to seven plant closures, including Oppama. Poor leadership caused job losses and a 70 percent drop in Nissan’s value—from over 1,000 yen per share to about 300 yen.

**Interviewer:** Japanese authorities say arrests are only made with strong evidence.  
**Ghosn:** Nonsense. I was arrested on one charge (unreported compensation) without a finalized or paid amount. Other charges came after raids. This was about neutralizing me and dismantling the alliance. France reverted to its pre-1999 position in the auto industry, with Nissan and Mitsubishi weakened and withdrawing from markets.

Japanese prosecutors even staged events for TV — claiming to arrest me on the plane, which was false since it was at the airport). They also showed boxes taken from my home post-escape as if they contained incriminating documents, which they didn’t.

I destroyed any documents they could twist into accusations—not because I was guilty, but because I knew their malice. Japan’s hostage justice system is medieval; long interrogations without counsel, “monitored” interpreters, recordings kept only by prosecutors, no fairness.

**Interviewer:** Did France also act against you?  
**Ghosn:** Yes, after Japan requested it. In France, a mere complaint freezes assets automatically as a “precaution.” This has dragged on for five years without real progress—France is following Japan’s lead.

**Interviewer:** About the Versailles controversy—  
**Ghosn:** It wasn’t my wedding; it was our 10th anniversary, and part of the Renault-Nissan alliance’s 15th anniversary celebrations, attended by 250 guests, paid by the alliance, not by public funds. Two weeks later we held a similar event in Japan. The narrative was manipulated while I couldn’t speak.

**Interviewer:** Let’s discuss the escape plan.  
**Ghosn:** I decided to escape 3–4 months earlier, after realizing a fair trial was impossible. I tested multiple methods before settling on the instrument case plan. It was year-end; airport staff were temporary and less alert. My advantage was no one expected me to try.

I avoided using my monitored phone—used unmonitored ones and spoke under running showers to mask sound. I disguised myself in jeans, cheap coat, casual shoes, cheap watch, glasses—things I never wore normally. In December, masks and hats weren’t suspicious. I stayed silent to avoid voice recognition.

The box was brought to an airport hotel, not my house. I walked there, entered naturally, then in the room entered the case. It was about 1.5 hours inside before boarding. I emerged only after takeoff. From Kansai Airport to Turkey, then quickly transferred in bad weather to a flight to Beirut. Landing in Lebanon at dawn felt like a rebirth.

**Interviewer:** What was the first thing you did after getting out of the case?  
**Ghosn:** Drank coffee and water—needed to calm down. Then to my wife’s mother’s house; she cried when she saw me.

**Interviewer:** You’ve since been Red Notice-listed.  
**Ghosn:** Interpol is just a tool, following any member state’s request. But there’s always a way around obstacles.

**Interviewer:** What do you do now?  
**Ghosn:** I teach crisis management, leadership, and strategy at a private university here—sharing real experience, not theory. I also support lawsuits against Japan’s hostage justice system.

**Interviewer:** Will you return to Japan to stand trial?  
**Ghosn:** Never, unless the system changes completely and the damage done to me is recognized. In France I’m fighting the charges; if I win there, Japan’s case will look absurd.

**Final message to Japan:** For a year after my arrest, the public only heard the prosecutors’ version, supported by Nissan and the Ministry of Economy. Even if I had done something wrong, the way they handled it was wrong. In reality, I did nothing wrong—this was a setup, prepared for months. Look at Nissan today—factories closed, communities hurt, thousands losing jobs. Would this have happened if I were still leading? That’s my question to you.",1,1769688805.0,HostageJustice,0,1.0,False

I’ve complained to management and had a plumber come out 3 times but the problem is on going. 

  
The issue: Sometimes we get really hot water (like coffee making temperature), most times it’s just warm (like  room temp or a bit warmer, which when it comes to a shower is basically cold), and on occasion, even with the handle turned all the way, the water is just ice cold. The worst is that sometimes during a warm or hot shower the water will suddenly turn ice cold, which is not fun when trying to wash your hair. When it’s cool  I run the water for 5-10 minutes and it never gets any hotter. The issue is also the same in the bathroom sink and the kitchen sink, though the not always at the same time. the kitchen can be hot, but then the shower is cold, and the bathroom sink is warm. or the kitchen can be cold but the shower is scalding. I am a female so I prefer hotter showers as a whole but even my husband has complained that the “warm” is cold, and is annoyed with the inconsistency. I’ve been trying to get this sorted since November 2025, but it’s been a background issue for maybe a year and a bit now. I’ve been in this building for 10 years and never had any issues until last year. 

the first time the plumber came he “fixed” something but all that changed was the water was coming out weird from the bathroom sink. the second time nothing changed. the third time, the water now gushed out of the bathroom sink, but temps are still an issue. 

I know other people on the building and they don’t have this issue. I’m at my witts end. I'm pregnant and it’s winter and I can’t even be guaranteed a hot shower in the morning before or after work, or even in the middle of the day to help soothe my aching body. 

I don’t want to have to pay out of pocket to have another plumber come, but clearly I need a second opinion - thus this post.

I've had an interest in conspiracy theories and online echo chambers for a while and I think they could provide good fodder for compelling story telling. Here's a rough idea I've come up with. Give an analysis, and suggestions for how it could be fleshed out and developed. Also suggest some appropriate formats (conventional and non-conventional).

---

A professional, maybe a government employee, uncovers an explosive secret. But he has a dark past, and risks exposure himself by exposing the secret. He is torn, but ultimately decides it's more important to blow the whistle and let the chips fall. But it doesn't go quite as he expects, no one seems interested in the revelations, and then things start to get very, very strange. People around him start behaving differently. First it was his colleagues, engaging in subtle bullying. This he came to understand was typical treatment for whistleblowers. But it didn't end there. Gradually, over a period of months, everyone around him start to display a pattern of covert hostility that they hadn't before, and that he couldn't quite put his finger on to be able to do anything about. This escalates, and he is forced to withdraw to protect his sanity, eventually becoming completely isolated and losing his job. He understands that all of this must be connected to his attempt to blow the whistle, but, while there are strong hints, there is nothing that he can definitively point to that conclusively establishes the connection.

He tries valiantly to get on with his life, but soon senses that the behavior he's noticed isn't limited to people he knows. Increasingly he gets the sense that strangers around him are somehow also involved. He hears snatches of conversation from bystanders which seem to reference him specifically. The coffee shop staff say things that seem to have some hidden meaning directed at him.

Then he notices small things change in his home. He returns home to find a door unlocked, a cabinet open, a window open that isn't normally. One day his car won't start, and he finds the battery has been drained by the cabin light, which he is certain he didn't leave on.

He goes onto the internet to see if he can learn more and maybe share his story, and soon discovers various ""targeted individual"" and ""gangstalking"" communities, where people claim to be followed in public, which is not unlike his experience. But they also frequently talk about hearing voices, and mind control, and to all appearances present as clearly delusional.

So he tries to engage in these communities to see if he can discover the dividing line between mental illness and reality. He engages enthusiastically at first, assuming that he is talking to real people with real issues. But as he continues to engage, he comes to learn that these communities are not at all as they seem: the accounts seem too inauthentic, too repetitive, too inconsistent to be genuine. So he probes further, and gradually becomes certain that most if not all of the actors in this community are wholly inauthentic and the community all the signs of an intelligence disinformation operation. Indeed, when he looks carefully, he can see the actors providing abundant clues, all carefully placed between the lies, so that the truth is thoroughly mixed up with a carefully crafted fiction.

There can be no question he's stumbled into the modern version of a COINTELPRO operation that uses psychological warfare to discredit, and he's trapped in it.

This is a really fascinating premise! The psychological and social dynamics at play are compelling, and it taps into current fears about surveillance, misinformation, and how people interact with both the state and the internet in the digital age. The gradual descent into paranoia, isolation, and the blurring of reality and delusion creates a lot of rich narrative possibilities, particularly in how it plays with the boundaries between truth and conspiracy.

### **Analysis of Core Themes & Structure:**

**1. Paranoia and Isolation:**
The protagonist’s slow breakdown, both mentally and socially, is at the heart of the story. He begins by trying to make sense of something that seems like a conspiracy (the reaction to his whistleblowing), but as time passes, the walls close in around him. The key theme here is the uncertainty of what's real versus what's imagined, a delicate balance to maintain in storytelling. It would play well into a psychological thriller where both the protagonist and audience are left guessing about the protagonist’s own mental state.

**2. Online Echo Chambers:**
The exploration of online communities and the disinformation campaign through COINTELPRO-style tactics is rich ground for both cultural and psychological commentary. It critiques how the internet, once a platform for free speech, has evolved into a space where truth is fractured, manipulated, and drowned in noise. The protagonist’s interaction with these communities—feeling increasingly alienated from what should be a shared sense of truth—can symbolize how the digital age creates confusion, and how disinformation becomes so hard to separate from genuine experiences.

**3. The Collapsing of Social Reality:**
The protagonist’s changing relationship with the people around him is important for showing how systems of control work: subtle manipulation that isolates and disorients. It’s like the real world becomes a strange, distorted echo of the internet's more extreme and distorted versions of truth, adding layers to the narrative as the protagonist's paranoia spreads.

**4. The Conspiracy Within a Conspiracy:**
The twist that the protagonist’s pursuit of truth leads him into a disinformation operation of his own is brilliant. It sets up a kind of meta-commentary about how the very act of investigating conspiracies can entrap someone within one itself. The blurred lines between truth and manipulation, reality and delusion, keep the audience guessing.

---

### **Suggestions for Development:**

**1. Character Development:**

* **Backstory:** His dark past is hinted at but needs more fleshing out. Was he involved in shady government work before, maybe even complicit in what he's now blowing the whistle on? Does he have personal guilt that adds a layer of vulnerability to his character, making his decision to expose the secret even more complicated? His past can be something that the story slowly reveals, which also can tie into the themes of paranoia.
* **Internal Conflict:** The protagonist needs to be relatable. His desire for truth should conflict with the costs of exposing it. This tension could lead him to justify his increasingly erratic behavior or allow for moments of doubt that make the reader question his mental state.
* **Support Characters:** There are opportunities for secondary characters who may be more than they seem. Perhaps an old friend, colleague, or even a romantic interest who seems to offer support, but later reveals some deeper, more sinister alignment.

**2. Timeline and Pacing:**

* The slow escalation of weirdness (people acting differently, things changing in his environment) is a good build-up. But maintaining tension is key. If you draw it out too slowly, it might risk losing momentum; if it's too quick, the audience won’t have time to immerse in the paranoia. Balancing these moments with high-intensity sequences is crucial.
* **The Moment of Realization:** When the protagonist realizes he's caught in a web of disinformation, the transition from confusion to certainty needs to feel earned, not forced. This is the moment where the audience realizes that the protagonist’s grasp on reality is becoming compromised, and that realization could act as the narrative's pivotal turn.

**3. Narrative Structure and Format:**

* **Nonlinear Narrative:** Given the psychological aspect, a fragmented timeline (maybe with flashbacks to his past) could convey the fractured state of the protagonist’s mind. You could experiment with unreliable narration—where the protagonist himself begins to question if he's even telling the truth. This could engage the audience in a deeper meta-level of skepticism about the story itself.
* **Multiple Perspectives:** One interesting approach might be to occasionally step outside the protagonist’s perspective, either through chapters written from the viewpoint of his colleagues, strangers, or even from the perspective of the disinformation agents. This would give the audience more context but also increase the sense of paranoia, as readers begin to see things from a broader perspective.

---

### **Possible Formats:**

**1. Conventional Formats:**

* **Novels/Books:** This is the format where you can really explore the psychological depth of the protagonist and go into intricate detail about the conspiracies. A psychological thriller with unreliable narration, focusing on the protagonist's downward spiral into doubt and paranoia, would fit well here.

* **Film or TV (Psychological Thriller/Conspiracy Drama):** This format would allow for a strong visual style. Playing with perception through cinematography—subtle camera angles, reflections, shifting focal points—could complement the narrative’s themes of instability and disorientation. A TV show could delve into a deeper exploration of online communities and the protagonist’s increasingly isolating interactions with the world.

**2. Non-Conventional Formats:**

* **Interactive Fiction/Video Game:** If you want to take it into a more experimental direction, you could develop an interactive experience where the player/protagonist uncovers secrets, interacts with communities, and has to make decisions based on increasingly unreliable sources. This could mimic the disorienting, shifting world of conspiracies and manipulation by making the player question whether they can trust anything or anyone.

* **Mixed Media (Documentary-Style/Mockumentary):** An unconventional option could be creating a mixed-media format, blending documentary-style elements (interviews, found footage, news reports) with fictional narrative elements. This could enhance the disinformation themes, making the audience question which parts of the story are real or fabricated.

* **Augmented Reality or ARG (Alternate Reality Game):** Given the real-world online echo chamber component, an ARG could allow participants to experience both the protagonist's investigation and the disinformation process themselves. Players could explore fake websites, uncover hidden clues in the real world, and interact with characters who may or may not be real, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.

---

### **Additional Elements to Explore:**

* **Digital Surveillance and Big Data:** How does the protagonist realize that his life is being manipulated or surveilled? Could his email, phone, or online activity be tracked and manipulated by forces trying to control the narrative?

* **Technology’s Role in Dissonance:** How do technologies like social media, algorithms, and deepfakes play a part in the disinformation? These elements can give the story a modern edge and connect it to real-world debates on privacy and security.

* **Themes of Truth and Power:** The final philosophical questions—if there’s a conspiracy at play, does the truth even matter if no one believes it? And what power does the public have in the face of systemic manipulation? Could the protagonist ever get his truth out, or is he trapped in a system that won’t let him?

This story has real potential to explore the fracturing of truth in a hyper-connected, increasingly distrustful world, while delivering a captivating psychological thriller.",2,1769688217.0,TargetedSolutions,0,1.0,False

I have a Costa Rica Tarrazú coffee, 1450–1750 meters, Caturra and Catuai varieties, with anaerobic lactic fermentation. I’m roasting it on a Behmor, but I can’t seem to get the right profile.

We also have an anaerobic natural fermentation from the same farm, and roasting that on the same profile works really well. But the anaerobic lactic coffee doesn’t come out nicely. It has very light sweetness, very light body, a slight green acidity, and some flavor, but it’s distant and hard to define.

I’m wondering if anyone has experience with aerobic lactic coffees on the Behmor and could suggest a profile or approach to bring out more clarity and flavor. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",1,1769688086.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

We are dealing with a massive debt pile and since the government said no to the IMF and their tough conditions they’ve started taking money directly from the Central Bank just to keep the lights on and pay salaries. This is basically like printing money which is a recipe for disaster because it keeps inflation high and makes the Dinar weaker every day so even if you have cash in your pocket it buys way less than it did last year. The government is trying to tax the banks and big companies even more to fill the gap but that’s not really a long-term fix when the youth unemployment is still through the roof and the economy is barely growing at all. To actually fix this mess the country needs to stop the drama and start making it easier for people to open businesses without a mountain of paperwork while also getting the phosphate production back to its glory days to bring in some real foreign currency. At the end of the day you can’t just talk about ""sovereignty"" if people can't find basic stuff like sugar or coffee at the store so the only real way out is a solid economic plan that focuses on digital growth and green energy instead of just borrowing from the future to pay for today.",1,1769688029.0,Tunisia,1,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

The clothing, accessories, and subtle extras you choose can bring a tiny sculpture to life in the most personal way. If you're looking to design a one-of-a-kind piece, here's how to make sure your outfit and props make it pop.

Start with the **outfit**, because what your figure wears sets the entire tone. Is it a casual jeans-and-tee kind of vibe or a bold, high-fashion look? Think about textures and layers. Leather jackets, scarves, or hoodies can add dimension. Even the way the clothing fits matters—tight, flowing, structured—every wrinkle or fold tells a story. If you're doing this for a gift, consider what the person wears often. Signature styles or favorite colors make the figure more recognizable and meaningful.

Next, don't skip out on **accessories**. These little additions have a huge impact. Glasses, hats, earrings, even wristwatches add character. Props can range from musical instruments to sports gear, coffee mugs to books—basically, anything that reflects personality or hobbies. A custom figure holding a tiny camera instantly tells you they love photography. The goal is to make your figure say something about the person, even if it doesn’t speak at all.

When it comes to the **tiny details**, this is where the magic happens. A tattoo peeking out from a sleeve, a detailed sneaker design, a tiny name on a jersey—these small touches are what elevate a figure from good to unforgettable. Think about posture too—do they stand tall, lean casually, or strike a power pose? Body language adds just as much personality as facial features.

Incorporating these thoughtful choices into your **custom figure** helps it tell a real story. It's not just a replica—it becomes a memory, a tribute, or a statement piece on your shelf. Whether you're gifting it to someone or keeping it for yourself, it's the uniqueness that makes it special.

So take your time and choose with care. From fabric folds to funky props, the magic lies in the personal touch. Every detail you add makes the figure feel more alive—and that’s exactly what makes it pop.",1,1769687911.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

Putting together a **movie-buff meetup** around a big-screen screening of *The Godfather* at PVR Nexus, Koramangala. The idea is simple: watch a classic in a theatre and catch up with fellow film lovers.

**Location:** PVR Nexus (Forum Mall), Koramangala  
**Date:** 27 Feb  
**Time:** 8:00 PM

This is a **custom ScreenIT show**, so it needs **at least 24 tickets booked by 21 Feb** to be confirmed. If the number isn’t met, the screening gets cancelled by PVR.

**How to book:**  
Tickets can only be booked via the **PVR mobile app**. (open the link from mobile)

**Booking link:**  
[https://pvrinox.com/VpZWOV4](https://pvrinox.com/VpZWOV4) (this is an incentive link check the notes below if you need non-incentive way to book although price is same in both)

**Note**

* Why am I sharing an incentive link?
   * This is my first time using ScreenIT, and this was the only shareable link the app provided. I could not find a non-incentive link option.
* What is the non-incentive way to book?
   * You have to book it manually (PVR App → More → ScreenIT → Upcoming → *The Godfather)***.**
* What if the show does not meet the minimum admit target by the deadline?
   *  the full ticket booking price will be refunded, excluding discounts, taxes, and convenience fees.
   * check the second image in this post to know more about this (its a screenshot from  a mail sent from PVR on my booking confirmation)

If the screening gets confirmed, happy to **coordinate seats and maybe a quick coffee/chat before the movie** for anyone interested. Posting here to see if there are fellow movie buffs around Koramangala who’d want to join.",3,1769687587.0,BangaloreMeetups,0,1.0,False

At least, that’s what I *thought*. I usually associate smoothies with summer — berries, ice, cold drinks — and once the weather cools down, I drift back to coffee and toast.

A couple weeks ago, though, I was craving something fall-flavored but still quick in the mornings. That’s when I started experimenting with **Seasonal Fall Smoothie Recipes with Pumpkin and Apple**, and I’m honestly surprised how much I’ve been enjoying them.

What changed my mind is that these smoothies don’t feel “cold and sad.” They’re comforting. Think cinnamon, nutmeg, oats, pumpkin purée, apples — flavors that feel more like breakfast than a diet drink. The whole idea behind **Seasonal Fall Smoothie Recipes with Pumpkin and Apple** is leaning into seasonal ingredients instead of forcing summer vibes year-round.

I started making them a few mornings a week, especially on days when I didn’t want a heavy breakfast but still wanted something filling. After a bit, I noticed:

* I stopped skipping breakfast on chilly mornings
* They kept me full longer than fruit-only smoothies
* Way fewer cravings for pastries or sugary snacks
* Mornings felt more “intentional” instead of rushed

What I liked most is how flexible these recipes are. Some days I make them thicker and more filling with oats or yogurt, other days lighter with just fruit and spices. Once you get the base ideas from **Seasonal Fall Smoothie Recipes with Pumpkin and Apple**, it’s easy to adjust depending on your appetite.

Another bonus: it helped me use seasonal produce instead of letting apples sit in a bowl until they go bad. These smoothies actually made me *look forward* to using pumpkin purée beyond the usual baked goods.

If anyone wants the specific recipes and combos I used, this is the guide I followed:  
👉 [**Seasonal Fall Smoothie Recipes with Pumpkin and Apple**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/fall-smoothie-recipes-pumpkin-apple/)

I’m still rotating a couple of favorites because they feel cozy without being heavy — which is kind of the perfect fall breakfast balance.

Do you change up your breakfasts with the seasons, or do you stick to the same routine all year?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I always plan to eat well, then morning chaos hits and suddenly I’m out the door with coffee and zero food. I’ve tried overnight oats, fancy meal prep, even skipping breakfast — nothing really stuck.



A few weeks ago, I finally tried Meal-Prep Smoothie Recipes You Can Freeze Ahead, and it’s honestly one of the most realistic habits I’ve kept.



The idea is simple but underrated: prep smoothie ingredients in advance, freeze them, and blend when you need them. No chopping fruit at 7am, no decision fatigue, no spoiled produce in the fridge. Once I set aside about 30 minutes on a weekend, weekday mornings got way easier.



What surprised me is how well the frozen smoothies actually turned out. I was worried they’d taste weird or watery, but the Meal-Prep Smoothie Recipes You Can Freeze Ahead approach focuses on combinations that freeze and blend well. The texture stayed thick, and the flavors held up better than expected.



Here’s what changed for me:



I stopped skipping breakfast during the week



Way less stress in the mornings



Fewer random snacks before lunch



Less food waste from forgotten fruit



The biggest benefit wasn’t weight loss or anything dramatic — it was consistency. Having Meal-Prep Smoothie Recipes You Can Freeze Ahead ready meant breakfast stopped being something I had to think about. I just grabbed a freezer pack, blended it, and moved on with my day.



I also like how flexible this is. Some packs are lighter and fruit-based, others more filling with oats or nut butter. Once you understand the basics of Meal-Prep Smoothie Recipes You Can Freeze Ahead, it’s easy to customize based on your schedule or appetite.



If anyone wants the exact recipes and freezing tips I used, this is the guide I followed:

👉 Meal-Prep Smoothie Recipes You Can Freeze Ahead



I’m still using this system because it actually fits real life — especially on busy mornings when motivation is low but hunger is high.



For those who meal prep: do you prefer freezing smoothies, prepping solid meals, or winging it day by day?

I always *intend* to eat something in the morning, but between hitting snooze too many times and rushing out the door, breakfast usually turns into coffee… and regret by mid-morning.

A few weeks ago, I decided to stop pretending I’d magically become a meal-prep person and instead look for something simple. That’s how I found **15 Easy Smoothies You Can Make at Home to Start Your Mornings Right**, and honestly, it’s one of the few habits that didn’t fall apart after a week.

What pulled me in was how realistic it felt. The whole idea behind **15 Easy Smoothies You Can Make at Home to Start Your Mornings Right** is speed and simplicity — ingredients you already recognize, minimal prep, and no “superfood” pressure. I didn’t need to plan my entire week around it.

I started making these smoothies on weekdays when I knew I’d otherwise skip breakfast. Some mornings I wanted something light and fruity, other days I needed something more filling with oats or yogurt. The flexibility made it easy to stick with.

After a couple of weeks, I noticed a few changes:

* I stopped skipping breakfast completely
* My energy felt more stable until lunch
* Fewer random snacks before noon
* Less stress deciding what to eat first thing

The best part is that **15 Easy Smoothies You Can Make at Home to Start Your Mornings Right** doesn’t feel like “diet food.” It feels like normal food that just happens to be convenient. If I’m missing an ingredient, I swap it. No guilt, no rules.

I also like that the recipes scale well. I’ve made some of them thicker for breakfast and lighter for afternoons. Once you understand the base ideas from **15 Easy Smoothies You Can Make at Home to Start Your Mornings Right**, it’s easy to mix and match.

If anyone’s curious, this is the list I’ve been using:  
👉 [**15 Easy Smoothies You Can Make at Home to Start Your Mornings Right**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/easy-morning-smoothies-you-can-make-at-home/)

I’m still rotating a few favorites because they save time and help me actually fuel my mornings instead of running on caffeine alone.

How do you handle breakfast on busy mornings — smoothies, skipping it, or something else that’s actually sustainable long-term?

I ask as regardless of grind size I don’t get first drop of coffee until 10-15 seconds after I press the button so then it’s just 15 seconds to get all my 38g of espresso out.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1qq69cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qq69cy/aitah_for_making_a_gay_character_bi_in_fanon/,AITAH for making a gay character bi in fanon,"Okay so this is my current beef, WITHOUT going into details about who, why or what. 
FYI: no one cares about him but I get a lot of shit for depicting him as Bi on X, etc. 

So, there's this character who I love. He used to be straight but then his backstory was retconned and he was made gay, and hey! Imo his new story works better. I love it. I love his nightmare ex. I love their horrible situation. It just feels more realistic, plus I think it suits his character. I can literally write a 100k word drama fic about him. 


Now: he's not a fan favorite. I can literally count three people who like him (me included among those). So, I decided to make fanworks with him. I drew him, heck I even wrote some stories. If you look him up on social media it will literally be filled with my posts mostly. I wrote and made EVERYTHING that came to mind. Angst, Fluff, Smut, memes, incorrect quotes, everything. 


So, it's all fanon. In my stories I like to write him as Bi. (like he likes men 98% and then women 2% lol.) but it's fem pov oriented so the reader is female. Whether she's his girlfriend, wife, or ex wife, also depends on the timeline because I have him set differently for every timeline (1910, 1920, 1970 you get it) 


Also, I don't think this makes him any less gay?? He's still gay in canon. I'd love to say I do a damn good job describing his inner struggles, how he views himself, his partners, and complex sexuality in my stories.


 Recently, the only times when he's getting attention online,,, is under my posts when someone decides to chew me out for making him Bi. No cap. No posts about him, just comments under my own posts.
Literally no one cares if they see him. They only care if they see him with my f!mc. 
Then all of a sudden there's a whole debate about how it's “homophobic” 😭


Now,,,, I've literally talked to my friends about how straight characters get depicted as gay and bi all the time in fanon. It's just fun. There's no need to gatekeep a character, so I obviously don't see the big deal? There is no malicious intent or erasure. I don't see how it's homophobic in any way.


This morning, I woke up and there was a whole THREAD. Like you cannot make this shit up, a long ass THREAD on why I'm evil and bigoted and whatnot. Someone seriously just hates seeing me posted so they took time to collect all of my content depicting him with my f!mc (and they ignored all my posts where I draw him with his ex who's a man of course. Even tho yk...i make him gay memes and fanart too, just not stories) So, obviously I rambled to a friend about it because I want him to actually get attention. Not just these complaints made by people who dgaf 🫤


She told me it's very offensive for me to include a gay character in straight stories because of the fem pov and that smut was unacceptable because it fits some big “heteronarrative” and that if I really like him so much I wouldn't do that to him. This whole time I'm just looking at her like “🤨” because…she literally draws her male oc… making out and whatnot with a fucking character who is canonically STRAIGHT. So, I tell her she's being a hypocrite. She gets all defensive and starts raising her voice at me. We proceed to just bicker back and forth with her being insistent that now I'm not just homophobic I'm biphobic too, at some point she says I should just leave my favorite character to the gay men and fuck off so I told her “girl I am the only one actively posting for HIM. LITERALLY NO ONE CARES ABOUT HIM” 


So, after that, I just drank coffee and thought about whether it's really such a crime because oh God she made it sound like I murdered her whole family or something. Like if you heard her you'd assume I legit walked into her house and then stole her cat too. 🤨


So, yeah fellas is it homophobic?? 


Would I be the asshole if I just continue with my fan content? And I guess AITAH for not seeing why it's wrong or bad. Explanations are welcome because it's not like I'm trying to offend anyone

​I’m a seasoned driver, but I’ve been forced into this bureaucratic nightmare where the instructor reeked of coffee and cigarettes, stood on the kerb for 4 hours while I drove in circles, and the only ""teaching"" they did was handing over a payment schedule. Appointments are months apart, and there is zero focus on traffic laws or defensive driving.

​To make matters worse, the equipment is a joke. The bike they had me learn on wouldn't even pass a basic inspection:
​The tires were flat.
​The low beam was burned out.
​The horn barely worked.
And the Instructor told me to leave it in 2nd gear, don't shift.

​Sending a learner out on an unroadworthy ""death trap"" isn't just a scam, it’s a massive liability!

It’s no wonder we have so many unlicensed or uneducated drivers on the road. The high costs and endless red tape make a legal license feel out of reach for many low-income families. 

Uneducated drivers are bad drivers!

​The Solution: We need to eliminate the requirement for licensed instructors. Allow CDL holders (experienced drivers) to train LDL holders (learners) for the circuit and road components.

​Lower Costs: Make licensing accessible, not a RM2,000+ ""processing fee.""
​Increase Compliance: More people will get licensed if it doesn't involve a 6-month wait and a lazy instructor.
​Safety First: Keep the JPJ final exam strict, but let the training be handled by mentors who actually care.

​It's time to cut the red tape and prioritize actual road literacy over bureaucratic profit.

​TL;DR: KL driving schools are overpriced rackets with lazy instructors and dangerous, unroadworthy vehicles. We need to break the instructor monopoly and allow experienced drivers (CDL) to mentor learners (LDL) to bypass these negligent schools and actually put safe drivers on the road.",79,1769685861.0,malaysia,35,0.92,False

I (f25) have been friends with ""Emma"" (f25) since we were kids. We grew up together. I love her, but she has untreated BPD and is one of the most difficult people I've ever met.

She's often upset by ridiculous things that she doesn't have the right to be upset about. The problem isn't just that she gets mad, it's the fact that she gets extremely mean. She loses it, showers me with insults, then guilttrips me and demands an apology - while never apologizing herself. 

It was better when she was on medication, but she went off about a year ago. She claims she's now ""fine"" and refuses therapy as well.

I've had 2 major fights with her just in the past week. First, because I didn't go to a party at her place - I had a career-defining exam the next morning, which she knew about months in advance. She blew up my phone with texts about how I'll lose all my friends if I keep ignoring them in pursuit of a career (I don't, I just can't go out drinking every week) and how deeply I'll regret being ""such a shit friend"" and how ""there will be no one at my funeral for a reason"". I just didn't reply. This was friday, I had the exam on saturday.

We then met up yesterday - she called me as if nothing happened and asked to grab a coffee. We did, I pointed out how mean she was being, she said that I hurt her much more than she hurt me, so I should move on, because she did. When I said my exam went well, she told me she doesn't wanna hear about it.

She was telling me about how excited she is to watch her sister's kid this weekend. I mentioned that now that I'm (probably, if I passed) done with school, she'll be able to watch my kid soon.

FYI, I'm engaged with a partner of 8 years, we're financially stable and have full support of both our parents.

She instantly became passive agressive, basically ragebaiting me. First remark was ""I could NEVER see you as a mom"", then ""I'd be so embarrassed if I got pregnant at our age"" and ""just imagine how fat you'll get"". I straight-up asked her why she's saying such negative things and her response was ""I'm just speaking my mind, I won't pretend I'm happy for you when I think you're being dumb"".

I've been very patient with her in the past. I never returned the insults or the hurtful comments. I know she acts the way she does because she's afraid of being abandoned. She's like a sister to me, her parents are basically my second parents and vice versa. But I just can't handle it anymore.

She dropped out of uni because of her BPD. She can't keep a job for more than a few weeks. Her last relationship fell apart after she went off her meds. All of our common friends have cut her off. She's never needed help this badly before, but she's also never been in such denial before. It wasn't great in her teens and early 20s either, but at least she blamed all of her shortcomings on her BPD - meaning that she was still willing to work on herself. Now, she completely refuses the notion of there being something wrong with her and is genuinely convinced she's fully justified in her behaviour.

How can I help her? If I can't, how can I stay friends with her? How do I put up boundaries without losing the friendship? Is that even a possibility?

He actually asked me what my favorite childhood book was and when I told him he suggested we meet at this cute little used bookstore downtown. 

We spent two hours just walking through the aisles and talking about the stories that shaped us. He even noticed me looking at a vintage poetry collection and secretly bought it for me along with a handmade bookmark. It was the most thoughtful and intentional date I have been on in years. I felt like a character in a movie and the conversation flowed so much better than it ever does over drinks. It is amazing how much you can learn about someone just by looking at what they read.

1qq5xr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATiim/comments/1qq5xr6/spjimr_interview_transcript/,SPJIMR Interview Transcript,"**Profile:** 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher

**CAT:** 96.53 %ile

**Specialization:** Marketing **Slot:** 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons.

G1 started at 11am

**Panel:** P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

**Actual questions:**

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)

First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.",1,1769685616.0,CATiim,2,1.0,False

So a few hour ago I went to sleep but woke up really quick, so I stayed awake until I felt sleepy again. 

My room was dark when I went to sleep, but when I supposedly woke up again, the light of my sister's desk was on, so I thought my sister was awake because sometimes she wakes up early and drinks a coffee.

I was in the verge of sleeping but conscious enough, so I just decided to affirm. There are some times I feel like I'm going to shift out of the blue so I just affirm. I was able to let my body stay up while I was conscious. 
 At a point I was a bit unsure if I was doing it on a dream or what because my room looked realistic, I felt all my senses and it didn't have the odd feeling of being in a lucid dream. Let's say everything was stable. I also tried talking but i felt my whole throat and I ended up whispering because I knew that I would scream if I spoke as if it was a dream. I heard my voice. When I speak on dreams I don't even feel my voice or hear it, I just know I spoke. 
While affirming, I felt a body too, so I thought I might be on hypnapompia. After a time I just decided to stop affirming.

I don't remember going to sleep at all or intending to, just found myself again on my couch but my room was dark.
I knew I didn't wake up again since sleeping more that two times gives me headaches, but I was perfectly fine as if I only slept a second time. My sister was sleeping but woke up not long ago, so I asked her if she turned on the lights of her desk by any chance, and she said no. 

The thing is that I'm confused whether that was a shift or it was something else. My dreams aren't that accurate + whenever I wake up from a lucid dream or altered states where I'm conscious I feel like I didnt even rest. 

I mean, I don't mind if it's something else, but if it's a shift, although it wasn't where I wanted I'm really happy. Shows that I'm okay with my shifting journey. 

If it was something else... well, god knows what it was but the experience was curious. ",1,1769685563.0,shiftingrealities,0,1.0,False

Hashimoto’s thyroid and post menopausal. Doing Noom micro-dose now but switching to local compounding pharmacy when done with 3 months of Noom. My primary doc will write me a script for micro-dose to local compounding pharmacy. I know every body is different but here’s what’s worked for me.

\*Weigh and/measure ALL food & count calories

\*Been eating about 1,200 calories a day. At first I ate more but have decreased it some because I felt like I was eating when I wasn’t hungry to meet a calorie goal Noom set

\*I am in a calorie deficit of about 500 calories per day based on my TDEE

\*Eat between 75-100ish grams of protein a day. I eat fish, eggs, dairy but no other meat. Have protein powder in my coffee in a.m.

\*Eat fruit and vegetables every day. Very little processed food except rice cakes & whole grain tortilla chips

\*Pretty much eat the same stuff. Rarely eat in restaurants (maybe 3 times in 2 months)

\*Psyllium fiber every day and as much water as I can drink

\*Weigh myself every morning 

\*Walk 8,000 steps per day most days. Light hand weights. Not really into exercising and want this to be long term but I do love walking. It’s been crap weather here so I walk in my house. Sort of crazy to pace around inside but it’s what I’ve got until it warms up!

I haven’t been very hungry most days. Days I am, I add on a healthy snack and track calories for it. I portion out EVERYTHING. No more eating directly from the bag of chips or can of peanuts! The micro-dose has helped me not feel starving and want to snack so much. I think the thing that has helped the most on top of meds helping with appetite suppression is serving size, portioning and weighing food. 

I really struggled with gaining weight and not being able to lose it before meds! Wanted to share what has worked for me. Read a lot of other’s posts and got tips and tricks from them, so thanks to all the people who post here! ",5,1769684996.0,GLP1microdosing,5,0.86,False

1qq5nlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qq5nlj/i_myself_autistic_too_brokeup_with_my_autistic_ex/,I (myself autistic too) broke-up with my autistic ex who has always seemed rather inconsiderate and now I regret it and I need some advice about where to go from here.,"As the title states, I broke up with my ex some days ago and I'm starting to feel really ill about it. I know we said 'I love you' to each other but I don't know if her complete lack of consideration towards me was the right trade-off for it.

For context, we're both in our mid-20s and I earn twice as much as her. We are both autistic, although quite different in our demeanors and I will touch on why I say this later in the post (a rather long post, so thank you if you read the whole thing)

We'd been together for a little over 3 months now but had known each other for a few months prior (this was my first relationship and it took me a while to get comfortable and be able to ask to be her boyfriend). The first few months were rather slow but come August '25, things started to pick up pace in terms of the things we did together and the amount of time we spent with each other. I have very hectic work hours and deal with very sick patients but have always made time to see her after work (even if I got home at 9PM - she lives an hour away from mine), however this was never reciprocated (mainly during the weekdays, we'd spend the weekend at mine). The weekdays at her place would always mean that dinner was ordered in (she'd never prep anything, not even a cup of hot chocolate in spite of knowing that I liked hot chocolate) and it would always be either take-away or order in. And I would always have to pay for this. She'd never offer to split proportionately or have dinner at home, even despite me telling her that I was struggling financially (because of my financial and saving goals, which she knew about). I would constantly have to dip into my savings to allow for this and she knew this as well. If I didn't bring up dinner, she'd never mention it and I'd leave close to midnight without having had anything. The only 'dish' we'd ever had was frozen pizza and garlic bread - and that was only a few times too, over the close to half-year we'd known each other. Whenever she'd be over at my place for the weekend (friday-saturday-sunday), I'd always make breakfast, lunch and dinner and multiple hot drinks for both of us throughout the day (mind you, this was not because I was forced to, but I did like doing this and seeing her happy) and I'd always ask if she'd like to have something while I did. 

There were days when she had the opportunity to at least make breakfast for us together (one that stands out was when I'd come home after studying and a driving lesson but she'd only just got out of bed and proceeded to make breakfast only for herself as I was in the same space as her). She has literally never asked me if I'd like a cup of coffee. 

Food aside, as I said earlier, she would never be understanding of my financial situation despite me telling her that I was struggling and was having to dip into savings to pay for the restaurants she'd want to go to. It came to a point where I had to resort to a single portion of a side to be able to afford the dinner we had, and she knew what I'd ordered but still went ahead with a full meal (minus dessert) and still did not offer to split. 

She was there emotionally for me and I am ever grateful for that. I have a very broken family back home and am currently in the process of going no-contact / minimal contact with them and she has been very supportive of this. 

But the complete lack of consideration about everything just couldn't sit right with me. 

There was a day when we'd gone out after my exam and after some time out, I took her to a jewelry store and showed her a piece I was looking to buy myself. On exiting the store, she proceeded to talk about how she felt really poor by comparing her situation to myself and how she did not like being there (which she did not mention one bit while in the store, because I'd have left immediately if she had). This was the second time something similar had happened and the complete lack of 'happiness' towards myself being able to enjoy what I'd earned hurt me quite a bit and I couldn't understand whether I'd done something wrong in that situation. 

Her ideals about relationships (when talking about them online) were quite different when compared to what she inevitably wanted from ours. 

When I told her I was breaking up and explained everything to her and how I'd felt, she started off by saying she was autistic and hence couldn't understand social cues and didn't know that she had to do the things I'd spoken about to make me feel considered for. She told me that she wanted us to work and 'wanted to negotiate' (but on social media, would continue to engage and approve of people breaking up if they had different ideals, without any sort of middle ground). She was rather emotional and said I was 'the best boyfriend' she'd ever had and thought of me as her best friend (which I could not say about her because I'd never felt safe enough to be open with her - everything she'd ever communicated about relationships was that 'if the people involved want different things, they should break up' rather than 'they need to work on a middle ground and make things work for each other'. She never wanted LDR and said she'd break up with me if I had to move out of the city for work but when I brought this up on the day of the break up, she said 'we could've made it work' like she hadn't said the complete opposite all year long. 

I really loved this woman and I wanted to make it work, and while we continue to talk to each other and don't know where this is going, I don't know how to feel about everything. I understand that autistic people struggle with social cues but when my 'best friend' is telling me that they're struggling, I will try my best to help them. And I'm not even asking for money or for her to split 50-50 all the time, a cup of hot chocolate would have gone a long way or maybe thinking about a slightly inexpensive place when I'm telling you that I've got only a few bucks left in my account. There's never been anything from her end, it ended up feeling like it's just been me pouring myself out for her and I'm conflicted about my emotions.

I feel like a douchebag now after having made her cry that day and I need some advice on whether I end it for good or accept her apology and understand that I need to be more accommodating with her needs, because I feel like there was ample time (several months, to be very honest) for her to do anything for me but this never happened and is that indicative of how she feels about me?",1,1769684660.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Come on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Cool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those?  that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Chemical-y. Careful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Candy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Coming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Can I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Come on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Can I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Cinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish.

All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully.

What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Crazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Check out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Chung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Call your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. ",1,1769684001.0,copypasta_es,0,1.0,False

It ends in October 2027 so I want to utilize it. Currently, I'm putting lots of effort and resources in studying German, but I kinda also want to start on another language (maybe French, Japanese, or Norwegian) as a more ""passive"" type of learning. Additional context, I reached some good A1 in Japanese and Norwegian way back, so I sort of want to get back at them, but French is a pretty new interest for me (I still have the Japanese hira and kata memorized). These are my current practices/routines:

\- Duolingo: I exclusively use it for German just to keep my momentum in the language.

\- Instagram: I have a separate account of just German and French content creators/influencers + language teachers for immersion.

\- Deutsche Welle: It's like a structured course (really popular in German language learning subreddit) that I take at least 4 times a week for 1.5 hours per day.

\- Rosetta Stone: I started French here and 90% done with Unit 1. But I am open to switching to another language if you suggest it would be better.

\- Busuu: I use it to learn French, currently 19% of the A1 course.

\- Coffee Break German: I listen to this when I don't feel like sitting down and focusing too much for the day or I am in a car/bus ride.

\- Grammar Book: Just German

\- Tandem: Talking with people in German! *Since I'm still A1, our conversations don't really go to a much deeper topic.*

\- HelloTalk: Talking with people in French! *Since I'm still A1, our conversations don't really go to a much deeper topic.*

Yeah, so my question is, do you think it's fine that I continue using it for more passive learning of the French language? My worry about switching it to German is that I'm being WAY too redundant, given that I'm already studying A1 on multiple platforms (but I guess redundancy wouldn't hurt?) My worry with NOT switching is that it's way too passive that I might have to supplement my French with something else, and I end up dividing my language learning attention too much lol. Any opinions, comments, or suggestions are welcome! Just be nice about it hahaha especially if you think I have some ideas, practices, or too much enthusiasm that I need to adjust.

That is all thank you for reading my long post! <3

She's kinda beautiful and even though so far she doesn't really look like my type I don't mind getting to know her further with an open mind. Mostly importantly though she and I live in the same city, which may not sounds like that big of a thing but trust me it is when it comes to where I live. To put things into prospective so far I ve only encountered like 4 people from my city or near by.

Now, the problem is she's not really talking to me. I mean she did a little bit but most of her replies were either evasive or half-baked. I tried asking whether she was busy or not since it takes a lot of time for her to reply like if I'm lucky I'll get like 5+ texts from her for the whole day. Despite all that from what she told me she's not busy at all. In fact she's done with her finales and just waiting for her results (just like me).

I don't know what to go from here on. Like I tried asking her directly if she was really interested in me and what I got was ""Hey I'm sorry. I'm just feeling lazy to text and talk🥲"" so I tried giving her some space like 2 whole day went by without me bothering her and by bothering I mean getting to know her. Even after all that she's still not opening up. All I'm getting out of her are, a cycle of ""Hey"", ""Gummorrninggg"", and ""No"".

I have no clue what to do lol ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯ like I know for a fact that some people aren't good with texting so I was debating whether I should ask her out for coffee or something.

Turns out I was barely doing real work.

I tracked one full day and made a Sankey chart out of it. Out of 8 hours, only \~2-2.5 were actual focused work. The rest was social media, messages, emails, tab switching, random quick checks.

It never felt like procrastinating. It just felt like being “on” all day.

I tried willpower, timers, all that usual stuff that didn’t last.

What helped was adding friction instead of relying on discipline. I started using [Bloom](https://bloom.inc/), it blocks apps and sites, and you need a physical card to unlock them. Sounds gimmicky, but it worked way better than I expected.

Blocked socials, left the card in another room, and suddenly I wasn’t opening stuff on autopilot anymore.

Now I get almost double the real work done in the same time, and I’m less drained.

Ten years ago, I fell for you in a way I didn’t know how to name back then. We only ever had a short, almost stolen moment together, but somehow you stayed with me far longer than that moment ever should have allowed. You became the quiet “what if” I carried for years nothing loud, nothing dramatic... just there, in the background of my life. You were my standard. Recently, when we crossed paths again and sat down for coffee, it stirred things I honestly thought I had already made peace with. I knew then like I know now... that the timing wasn’t right, that we both have lives that don’t quite allow space for unfinished stories.

What I struggle with isn’t what we were, but what keeps resurfacing. The small interactions. The occasional chats. The reactions to my stories. They’re gentle, almost harmless on the surface, yet they arrive just when I’ve begun to feel okay again. I can’t tell if they mean something to you, or if they’re simply moments of familiarity and comfort like echoes without intention. I don’t blame you for any of it. I’m just trying to understand where I stand, and whether what I’m holding onto exists anywhere beyond my own heart.

Maybe this letter is less about you, and more about me finally acknowledging the truth: that I’m tired of guessing, tired of hoping quietly, tired of reopening something that never fully opens back. I don’t write this asking for answers. I write it to be honest — with you, but more importantly, with myself.",2,1769683637.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I opened my Etsy shop selling phone cases but didn't work, I committed one of the first mistakes of an entrepreneur, I create my own designs thinking that ""if I like it the rest too"", and I got my results, no sales. Then I moved selling customisable t-shirts and I saw some viewing on my store and I go excited until I sold my first one! In total sold just 5 in total, definitely I would love to even grow more but I feel that I got stuck, I wonder if you can check my shop and give me your sincerely critic so I can make it better!

Warm woods, clean lines, and iconic silhouettes come together to create a nostalgic yet modern aesthetic that feels both inviting and enduring. Paired with statement lighting, geometric art, and thoughtfully chosen accents, this style brings character and balance to any living space.

In this guide, we’ll break down how to select the perfect media console to create a mid century modern living room—from size considerations to wood tones and matching with existing furniture

# Key Elements of Mid Century Modern

[HERNEST Julius MCM Media Console, classy and full with curves](https://preview.redd.it/vm84a3m2o9gg1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d598bb7f707ce8d6a4d125592a93284ba6a499b)

Mid-Century Modern (MCM) furniture draws from the design innovation of the mid-20th century. It’s clean, functional, and timeless—a balanced blend of form and function. Nothing feels overly ornamented; instead, every detail is intentional. These qualities work beautifully in contemporary apartments, classic suburban homes, and transitional interiors alike.

Look for these signature features:

* **Clean Lines & Geometry:** Uncluttered, sleek, linear profiles with simple geometric forms or balanced curves.
* **Functional Minimalism:** Form follows function—practical storage, flat surfaces, and no unnecessary ornamentation.
* **Mixed Materials:** Contrasting materials (wood/metal, wood/glass) add texture and visual contrast.
* **Tapered Legs:** Slender, often tapered, legs create a light, ""floating"" look, common on tables and cabinets.

# Mid Century Modern vs Scandinavian vs Danish Modern

These styles are closely related, but each has its own personality:

* **Mid-Century Modern:** Defined by warm wood tones, iconic tapered legs, and slightly bolder silhouettes. Retro-inspired, but not themed.
* **Scandinavian:** Lighter woods, softer lines, and an airy, minimalist feel. Bright, casual, and understated.
* **Danish Modern:** A refined branch of MCM, known for exceptional craftsmanship, elegant joinery, and a more formal, premium look.

These styles can mix beautifully when you keep the palette cohesive. For example, a walnut Mid-Century media console can pair effortlessly with a light oak Scandinavian coffee table.

# Wood Tones Compared: Choosing the Right Finish

The wood tone you choose affects not only the look of your media console, but also how it anchors your living room style.

# Brown — Rich & Classic

* Deep, warm brown tones with expressive grain
* Adds depth and sophistication to a space
* Pairs well with leather sofas, jute rugs, and earthy color palettes

**Best for:** Cozy, refined living rooms with a classic Mid-Century feel.

# Natural Oak — Light & Durable

* Lighter, golden tones that brighten the room
* Ideal for spaces with limited natural light
* Durable and forgiving, helping disguise dust and everyday wear

**Best for:** Scandinavian-leaning interiors or light, neutral palettes.

# Dark Brown — Warm & Elegant

* Deep, saturated tones that feel grounded and timeless
* Creates strong contrast against light walls or soft upholstery
* Adds a more formal, elevated presence to the room

**Best for:** Sophisticated interiors, larger living rooms, or refined Mid-Century and transitional spaces.

# Black — Clean & Contemporary

* Sleek, bold finish with a modern edge
* Creates a strong visual anchor and highlights clean silhouettes
* Pairs beautifully with metal accents, stone, or textured upholstery

**Best for:** Modern or minimalist interiors that want a contemporary twist on Mid-Century forms.

# Style Matching Guide

A Mid-Century Modern living room doesn’t mean every piece needs to be strictly MCM. Mixing and layering styles helps create a space that feels personal and lived-in.

# MCM Living Room Styling Tips

* Pair the media console with a low-profile sofa or sectional
* Choose a coffee table in a complementary wood tone
* Add one or two statement lamps with wood or metal details
* Introduce texture with rugs, baskets, or artwork that echoes the console’s finish

# Mixing with Existing Furniture

* Your current pieces don’t need to be era-perfect:
* Modern sectional sofas pair well with classic MCM consoles when lines stay clean
* Metal-accented furniture works best when the console has matching hardware or legs
* Limit your palette to one or two main materials (for example, walnut and black metal)
* Balance slim, leggy MCM furniture with bulkier pieces to create visual contrast

* **Trump officials told industry price floors gone, sources say**
* **Industry has long seen price support as tool to offset China**
* **US Senate committee reviewing price floor given to MP Materials**

Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is stepping back from plans to guarantee a minimum price for U.S. critical minerals projects, a tacit acknowledgment of a lack of congressional funding and the complexity of setting market pricing, multiple sources told Reuters.

The shift, which comes as a U.S. Senate committee reviews a price floor [extended to MP Materials MP.N](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-partners-with-department-defense-boost-us-rare-earth-magnet-supply-2025-07-10/) last year, marks a reversal from commitments made to industry and could set Washington apart from [G7 partners](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/g7-weighs-price-floors-rare-earths-counter-chinas-dominance-sources-say-2025-09-24/) discussing some form of joint price support or related measures to bolster production of [critical minerals](https://www.reuters.com/podcasts/reuters-morning-bid/mission-critical-trump-mineral-race-2026-01-28/) used in electric vehicles, semiconductors, defense systems and consumer electronics.

At a closed-door meeting this month hosted by a Washington think tank, two senior Trump officials told U.S. minerals executives that their projects would need to prove their financial independence without government price support, three attendees told Reuters.

""We're not here to prop you guys up,"" Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy and head of its Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, told the executives, according to this account. ""Don't come to us expecting that.""

# AUSTRALIA RARE EARTH SHARES SLIDE

The shift would guide future deals and does not affect MP's price floor, which the government agreed to as part of an investment package last July.

Robertson was joined by Joshua Kroon, the deputy assistant secretary for textiles, consumer goods, materials, critical minerals and metals at the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration.

Kroon and Robertson told the meeting that Washington is no longer in a position to offer price floors, according to the sources.

The Energy Department told Reuters in a statement after the story was published that the article was “false and relies on unnamed sources that are either misinformed or deliberately misleading.” The statement did not elaborate on what errors the department said it had found. The department did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

MP Materials did not respond to Reuters emailed request for comment, but after the story was published said in a statement on Twitter there had been no change to its contract or to the government's obligations around it. ""Any implication that the U.S. government has retreated from its commitments to MP Materials is simply false,"" it said.

Reuters did not suggest that any part of MP's deal was in jeopardy.

""Today’s Reuters report is inaccurate, misleading, and inconsistent with the facts. It follows a pattern of speculative and misleading reporting that has repeatedly mischaracterized government policy and caused unnecessary confusion in the marketplace,"" the company said.

Kroon and Robertson did not respond to requests for comment.

Shares in Australian-listed rare earths companies slid after the story was published, with those of the world's largest outside China, Lynas Rare Earths [(LYC.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LYC.AX), down more than 10% at one point. A Lynas spokesperson said the company was benefiting from the U.S. policy step, which had lifted rare earths prices.

""Price protection is most relevant for current producers, as it immediately addresses market dysfunction. Other policy instruments are available for, and have been applied to, early-stage projects,"" she said.

The steep drop for rare earth-related shares was overdone, said analyst Reg Spencer of Canaccord in Sydney.

""The comments are in line with our interpretation of the White House strategy that they don't intend to prop up every rare earths project using a price floor mechanism - projects will have to be developed on their own merits,"" he said.

""The U.S. is still supporting the development of an ex-China critical minerals supply chain. They may just use other methods,"" he added.

# CHANGE IN TACK

The administration's current stance is in contrast to a closed-door meeting held in July, where two officials separately told [minerals executives](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/trump-administration-expand-price-support-us-rare-earths-projects-sources-say-2025-07-31/) that a floor price extended to MP Materials days prior was ""not a one-off"" and that the administration was working on price supports for other projects.

Since then, the administration has taken equity positions in [Lithium Americas, opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-moves-away-critical-mineral-price-floors-sources-say-2026-01-28/nMT1ALTL2N3VA0PH2)[(LAC.TO), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LAC.TO), [Trilogy Metals](https://www.reuters.com/business/trilogy-metals-shares-soar-us-takes-strategic-stake-2025-10-07/) [(TMQ.TO), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TMQ.TO), [USA Rare Earth](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/usa-rare-earth-shares-surge-report-trump-administration-investment-2026-01-26/) [(USAR.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/USAR.O) and others. None were offered price floors, sparking questions about the government's commitment to that financial tool.

U.S. mining and processing companies have [pushed for price floors and other government backstops](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/albemarle-ceo-says-math-doesnt-work-us-lithium-refinery-project-2025-05-01/) to help them compete with China. Industry executives argue China's state-backed producers can slash prices to punish rivals, undercut projects and deter private investment.

The White House declined to say whether it plans to issue any new price floors, but said it will continue to pursue deregulation, tax cuts and targeted investments in the high-priority sector ""while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.""

Critics of price floors warn they could expose U.S. taxpayers to significant financial risk by forcing the government to subsidize minerals when market prices fall, potentially locking in long-term liabilities if prices remain depressed.

Legal experts also caution that guaranteeing minimum prices could face challenges under U.S. procurement, trade and budget laws, particularly if such support is seen as market distortion or lacks explicit congressional authorization.

Moving away from price floors does not preclude [other steps Washington could take](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/pentagons-ai-metals-program-goes-private-bid-boost-western-supply-deals-2025-05-01/) to bolster mineral projects and attempt to stabilize prices, including [stockpiling](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-create-25-billion-critical-minerals-stockpile-2026-01-15/), equity investments and local content stipulations.

Other countries, including [Australia](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australia-weighs-price-floor-critical-minerals-boosting-rare-earths-miners-2025-08-05/), have also considered price floors for critical minerals.

# MP DEAL UNDER SPOTLIGHT

The [MP Materials investment](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-partners-with-department-defense-boost-us-rare-earth-magnet-supply-2025-07-10/) sparked concern from some administration officials and members of Congress that funding for a price floor of at least $110 per kg for two types of rare earths had not been authorized by Congress, two additional sources familiar with the discussions said.

The economics of mineral markets since the MP investment have shifted. USA Rare Earth said this week it intends to buy those same types of rare earths for $125 per kg on the open market.

The MP investment, which included a guaranteed purchase agreement, fueled confusion over whether Washington would guarantee a price floor for others.

As the Trump administration considered other potential equity investments after MP, it recognized that it did not have the congressional authority to fund a price floor, the sources said.

That realization was fueled in part by an inquiry from members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which asked Pentagon staff last year to meet to explain why MP Materials received price-floor support and the administration's strategy around minerals sector investment, according to the two sources.

A committee staffer confirmed the meeting request but declined further comment.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[ \*\*\*NioCorp is NOT dependent on a single commodity price or a one-trick, market-supported revenue stream](https://reddit.com/link/1qq57yh/video/ms2bc4owl9gg1/player)

# ✅ OPINION: Why This Doesn’t Hurt NioCorp the Same Way...

Here’s the key: \*\*\***NioCorp is NOT dependent on a single commodity price or a one-trick, market-supported revenue stream.**

# 🧩 Diversified Revenue Stack

NioCorp’s Elk Creek project is slated to produce **multiple critical minerals**, not just NdPr or magnets:

* **Niobium (Nb)** — 100% imported into the U.S.
* **Scandium (Sc)** — 100% imported; strategic aerospace/defense metal
* **Titanium (Ti)** \+ **TiCl₄ / TiO₂**
* **Rare Earths:** Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium
* **(Potential future ScAl alloy products + recycled magnet loops)**

\*\*\*This means **Elk Creek’s economics aren’t reliant on a single price floor or one commodity’s price support.**

# 📌 Real World Economics, Not Hypothetical Subsidies

\*\*\*NioCorp’s upcoming updated DFS (mid–late March 2026) is expected to reflect **current market pricing** for all product streams, including NdPr and heavy rare earths — not price-floor assumptions.

# ****This means the project is being underwritten on realistic market revenues, not hypothetical government guarantees.

# 🚀 Broader Strategic Positioning

NioCorp’s embedded DoD engagement, Lockheed JDA on scandium, EXIM debt negotiations, and early construction activities signal **policy support through procurement, partnership, and financing structures — not price insurance**. That’s a more sustainable form of backing than a simple price floor, which markets often view as a subsidy rather than strategic demand.

# 📌 In Plain Terms:

**Price floors were one tool. Washington is now saying “we’ll use others.”** Market pricing support might not come, but **government collaboration, equity backing, procurement contracts, and strategic financing are still very much on the table.** NioCorp’s vertically diversified asset and upstream-to-downstream roadmap make it far less dependent on any single pricing mechanism — *including price floors*.

# As the U.S. Potentially Walks Back Price Floors —  NioCorp Is Positioned Better Than Ever

**Last night’s policy news rocked the critical minerals world:** sources say the Trump administration is stepping away from plans to guarantee minimum prices for critical minerals projects, a major shift from what many in the industry had been expecting. Price floors that were touted as a way to protect domestic miners from volatile global pricing and China’s state-backed production are now reportedly off the table **— at least for future deals.** This reflects a lack of congressional funding and the complexity of setting such floors, **and it has sent shockwaves through rare earth and critical mineral equities.**

That’s why stocks like MP Materials, USA Rare Earth, and other miners dipped — the market was pricing in policy support that now may not materialize. **Price floors were seen as a “safety net” against commodity price swings and Chinese pricing tactics, and their absence means developers will need to show they can stand on their own economically without that government cushion.**

\*\*\*But here’s the **killer point most people are missing:** **NioCorp’s strategy and economic model doesn’t depend on price floors in the first place!** Elk Creek isn’t a one-commodity play waiting for a government price guarantee. It’s a **multi-metal, vertically integrated critical minerals platform** designed to produce not just one product, but **seven strategic materials** — including niobium, scandium and its Al-Sc alloys, titanium (and TiCl₄ precursors), and magnet-critical rare earths like NdPr, Dy, and Tb. The diversified revenue base means the project can generate value from multiple streams, not just one — which inherently reduces risk and dependence on any single pricing mechanism.

More importantly, NioCorp has **real execution milestones underway** than most junior miners can only dream about. Government engagement already isn’t theoretical — the Department of Defense has provided Title III funding to build out a domestic scandium supply chain and is backing joint development with Lockheed Martin on Sc-Al alloys that have real defense applications. Meanwhile, the company is advancing toward **finalizing an updated DFS, progressing EXIM debt discussions, and beginning early portal construction in February** — moving from engineering to actual ground-breaking work, *not* waiting on policy crutches.

Contrast that with the miners who were hoping price floors would guarantee pricing flows. Those companies now have to lean harder on their own economic models. NioCorp already is. It’s proving economics not on theoretical guaranteed prices, but with **engineering work, diversified products, DoD investment, and scalable metals demand** baked directly into its project design. That’s why even this price-floor reversal doesn’t derail its story — in fact, it highlights NioCorp’s *resilience and strategic alignment with real market demand.*

Looking ahead, the U.S. government may emphasize **other forms of support**, including equity investments (as seen recently in some miners), stockpiling strategies, procurement agreements, and infrastructure investment to lock in supply chain resilience. Price floors aren’t the only tool — and frankly, they faced political and legal limits. But projects like NioCorp’s that integrate *multiple supply chain layers* (mining → processing → advanced materials → defense applications) are exactly what policymakers *will* want to see supported through durable partnerships and financing instruments that go beyond simple price guarantees.

# In short: price floors may be out of the toolbox, but NioCorp’s multi-metal, multi-policy-aligned, execution-focused model survives — and arguably thrives — in a policy environment that rewards real industrial capability over simple subsidy guarantees.

[All Aboard! \\""Full Steam Ahead!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1qq57yh/video/7lpqjml4n9gg1/player)

**What investors need to understand point blank:**  
**NioCorp management has never structured Elk Creek as a single-commodity price-floor-dependent project!**

As Mark Smith has repeatedly emphasized in recent (RedChip & Crux) presentations, the economic strength of Elk Creek comes from **multiple independent revenue streams** — Niobium, Scandium, Titanium, and Rare Earths — plus the emerging **downstream ScAl alloy opportunity**.

**That diversification is intentional &** **it means the project’s viability does not hinge on NdPr pricing alone, nor on government guarantees!!!** In fact, the upcoming DFS update is specifically designed to reflect realistic, financeable economics without relying on policy crutches.

***The market sold the sector broadly; the fundamentals for NioCorp did not change!!***

*To think this had been a sleepy border colony a few months ago.* Blu’uche’ese’s fingers and throat twitched as he sent a private message to Ghlark’s implants. Ghlark then gasped and winced, bringing his hand up to his brand new implants.

“Gah! I have no idea what you just said, Sir. My implant is apparently displaying everything in a hundred point font!” He complained with a frustrated croak as he leaned over and let the third member of their party take a look.

The two officers were shadowed by a rather strange, and short, telkan navy cybernurse. Normally telkan and leebawians were nearly the same size, but Ghlark was tall for a leebawian and so he had to keep leaning over as the cybernurse kept trying to get his new implants right, all the while letting out a never ending, grumbling, muttering litany of frustration about the commodore not remaining in the infirmary.

For his part, Ghlark just sighed and politely thanked the telkan medtech as the latest glitch was found, diagnosed and fixed.

“Still working out the glitches with the Thiccwire?” Blu’uche’ese asked, aloud this time.

“It’s new tech. Or…new-old tech. There’s bound to be some bugs. As frustrating as it is, it’s far preferable to feeling my implants trying to literally boil my brain again. Or, worse, wearing the brains of someone who did have their brains boiled.” Ghlark shuddered at the memories of Admiral Ohklan’s death.

“Oh I bet. Still, I hope no one thinks less of me for waiting a few days for the worst bugs to be ironed out to get my own work done.” Blu’uche’ese snorted before he reached up to rub the feeding tendrils around his mouth. “I wonder…”  
  
Before Blu’uche’ese could get his thought out a bipedal tigress blinked into existence before the trio. She gave a deep, formal bow with her hands to her side, one controlling the cut-tanya sword at her waist.

“Admiral, Fleet Commodore. System Commodore Halee welcomes you to her command center and bids me to guide you to her.”

“Thank you…Captain Lieutenant.” Blu’uche’ese returned the bow with a salute after a short pause to decipher the rank insignia on the tigress’s lapel: a Burgerland Kingdom Bald Scream-gull holding a sword in its claws above a pair of silver bars: literally “Captain-Lieutenant”. It was how the rogue eVI’s in the systems were identifying themselves.

In comparison Blu’uche’ese’s insignia were a pair of golden novas, identifying him as a Rear Admiral (Lower Decks). Due to the long life of lanaktallans he wasn’t due for promotion to the silver stars of the Upper Decks for nearly another century, but with the war he had a sneaking suspicion he’d be stepping into a dead bull’s golden stars depressingly soon.

Meanwhile Ghlark’s insignia were the standard silver avianid that varied on the species holding a weapon in its talons (a Swamp Pteradon holding a plasma rifle was the Leebawian Navy tradition) above two novas to elevate the Commodore above a Captain’s single nova.

The tigress noticed the telkan and sighed. “Are the new implants still giving you problems, Commodore?”

“A few, but they are to be expected between the damage to my tissues mixed with newly developed technology and naval security.” Ghlark nodded. “As one of the first naval officers to get this treatment that has enough sway to resist being tied down to a bed, the hospital was kind enough to offer me this excellent medtech to diagnose and troubleshoot any lingering problems.”

“We only let you out because the System Commodore requested your presence. She’s the only one short of the Digital Omnimessiah who had the sway to let you out early.” The telkan snorted as he flexed his left hand, making the claws on his fingers shift to cybernetic probes for a couple of seconds.

The tigress took a closer look at the telkan and an expression flashed across her face that the Solarian translation ware loaded in his implants managed to read as “shocked confusion” before she managed to suppress it. It was understandable, Blu’uche’ese had to suppress a similar reaction when he saw the cybernurse medtech.

A telkan, in this day and age, who not only openly carried extensive cybernetics and not only openly worshipped the Digital Omnimessiah but wore a holographic insignia showing the D.O.’s holy insignia of an infinity signal? Blu’uche’ese was pretty sure the only reason the telkan wasn’t causing a pandemic of second-take induced whiplash cases was because everyone was too busy to care.

*Ah, so he’s not one of yours? At least not one you knew about. I wondered…*

“That and I beat you in a game of Paradox-Billiards-Vostroyan-Roulette-Fourth-Dimensional-Chess-Strip-Poker!” Ghlark laughed.

“Because you cheated!” The telkan medtech muttered.

“We both cheated! I just cheated better!” Ghlark grinned, showing off his sharp, shark-like teeth. “And you all know the first rule of combat!”

“Be there the firstest with the biggest and the mostest?” Blu’uche’ese suggested.

“There is no overkill, only ‘Open Fire!’ and ‘Reloading!’?” The tigress offered.

“An army marches on its stomach, a navy floats on paperwork?” The telkan medtech tried.

“No, no, no! Though those are good! The real first rule of combat is if you’re not cheating you’re not trying hard enough!”

“Ah! Yes, the enemy does not play fair, so why should we?” The tigress purred. “Anyways, Commodore Halee is waiting.”

Blu’uche’ese laughed and stepped forward, motioning for the tigress to lead the way. “Oh of course, Captain Lieutenant! We mustn’t keep the system’s commander waiting!”  
  
The tigress bowed again and motioned for the group to follow her across the observation catwalks until they reached a larger platform where a pair of hestlans in naval uniforms stood overlooking more workstations and multiple large holotanks and 2.5D screens.

“Commodore, I’ve brought the Admiral and Fleet Commodore as you requested.” The tigress announced as she bowed to Commodore Halee. “Is there anything else you need of me?”

“Nothing at the moment, Hikari. You are dismissed to attend to your other duties.” Halee stated. The tigress purred as she bowed once more and took a moment to nuzzle the hestlan lieutenant standing next to Halee with the aid of a cane and walking cast on his leg.

Blu’uche’ese cleared his throat before the tigress could disappear. “Ah, before you go Captain Lieutenant, I had a question you might be able to answer for me.”

“Yes, Fleet Admiral? What can I do for the Navy today?”

“Ah, well I was mainly curious how you have already devised a countermeasure to the flashbang weaponry that Ghlark’s fleet encountered? While I’m glad that you have already produced a countermeasure for what seems like a devastating attack, I’m shocked you provided it almost instantly.”

“It wasn’t provided instantly. It took us thousands of hours of research and engineering to find a solution. We’re just able to provide those thousands of hours of work in a couple of days.” Hikari purred and made several holographic screens appear around her with a snap of her fingers.

“The *Bronze Cog* was designed to be the support and construction ship for the *Bronze Cog Games* endeavor of creating a fresh LARP system of worlds. Unlike most LARP systems we were looking to create a wonderland of industrial excess with little point beyond sustaining itself and growing.” She smirked. “We were pretty sure there would have been a waiting list a lightyear long for green mantids and…”

Hikari stood there and the tigress blinked and then let out a sad *mrooooowl* as a thought hit. “Sorry, I just realized that with the civil war the mantids recently had means there’s so few greenies now. The ones in cryostasis in the *Bronze Cog’s* hull are likely going to increase the entire green mantid population by at least two or three percentage points if we can ever find them again…”

“Oh, I hope you find them soon. I bet things will get wild when you unthaw that many green manties!” Ghlark laughed while Hikari rallied.

“Yes, anyways, since we were an industrial themed LARP who expected our players to make a mechanical pseudo-dystopia, engineering knowledge was placed as a high priority for the support staff. Especially us digital beings who can be heavily influenced in useful directions. For example: I was originally designed in the divergence creche to be a geisha, a form of courtesan. A joygirl if you will. However I was also designed to be the kind of lover who can show legitimate informed curiosity and interest in someone babbling about their engineering plans. The killing…came later…” The tigress sighed and shook her head.

Blu’uche’ese kept his face straight as he watched Halee spare a glance at her wounded lieutenant who was paying rapt attention to something on his tablet. He remembered the affection the tigress had shown the lieutenant a moment ago.

“Anyways, we have an unfortunate glut of ships, equipment and, sadly, people who have been injured by the weapon. We also are effectively the largest collection of cybernetic engineering minds outside of Cybertron. Meaning we can crunch a *lot* of data very fast.”  
  
Around Hikari several of the holographic 2.5D screens showed diagrams of damaged parts and implants.

“It wasn’t hard to see that the weapon attacked molecular circuitry. We still don’t know the exact attack vector but it seems to be using a phasic-based series of pulses to cause damage via overheating molycirc technology. We’re basically stripping out molycircs and replacing them with either ancient first or second generation molicyrcs or even more ancient copper and silicon technology that can handle the pulse loads.”  
  
“Hrrm…fascinating…” Blu’uche’ese ran his fingers through his feeding tendrils. “This attack is psionic as well? That makes shielding against it frustratingly difficult. A nasty weapon, I wonder if we’ve ever seen anything like it before.”

“Yes we have. Or, well, the Confederacy has. We had to dig through some historical records but there was a similar event that happened across the entire Orion arm of the galaxy that marked the end of the Shade Night.”

“The Shade Night…” Blu’uche’ese mused.  
  
“You mean the…Great Flashbang?” Ghlark asked before laughing. “Hah! I should have made the connection! We even called the attacks flashbangs!”

Hikari nodded. “That is correct. The vast majority of rampaging human shades disappeared after someone used the stabilizer devices located in the heart of every star in Confederate space to create a sort of psionic degaussing effect. This basically saved modern civilization as people no longer were being murdered by phasic shades, though the brain-drain of having over half of your population devoured in a few, short weeks cannot be overstated.”

“Interesting…”  Ghlark thought.

“The *Bronze Cog* was too far from any star to see any effects beyond several bright flashes in the visible spectrum. On one hand that was unfortunate because it failed to clear our own shade problem. On the other hand…”

Hikari dismissed the holographic screens and summoned a fresh set showing damaged molycirc electronics. Many of them had variations of the phrase “Pete, Stop Helping!” next to them in different languages.

“Historical analysis of the after-effects of the Great Flashbang show that while the phasic degaussing did clear the shades it had a likely unintended effect of damaging and destroying a lot of more advanced technology. Anything that used molecular circuit technology was at least partially at risk, which meant many technologies were lost or had to be reinvented from first principles in the upcoming decades. However anything on ancient larger, more durable silicon-on-metal for whatever reason was effectively immune to the Great Flashbang.”

“We’re already creating training simulations for your crews for everything from simply using to maintaining and repairing the replacement equipment. The new equipment will be bulkier and might feel more primitive but it will be just as responsive. This will include your internal cyberware. Again, *Bronze Cog Games* was built around emphasizing an industrial asthetic so we’re well versed in how to keep things from being actually too bulky. We’re passing on those tricks to your own fleet engineers in hopes they’ll be able to not only better service your new equipment, but perhaps modify it to better suit your needs.”

“Ah, excellent.” Blu’uche’ese nodded as he stroked his feeding tendrils. “Apologies for interrogating you, Captain Lieutenant, but the meeting yesterday simply said a solution had been found and gave us no further information. You’re simply the first Eternal Captain I had a chance to ask.”

“To be fair, that meeting was long enough already. I know I needed to do so but I was kind of afraid to ask for any further details than was given.” Ghlark sighed.  
  
“Well you had your upcoming surgery planned as well, didn’t want to draw it out too long. The medics were nearly pulling you away when we finally did finish…” Blu’uche’ese added before sparing a glance at the telkan medtech.

“Admiral, Fleet Commodore, System Commodore. Is there anything else?” Hikari bowed to the three in order and waited a moment before she disappeared in a shower of pink petals and revealed the floating elongated gemstone in the air that was her holo-emitter which quickly zipped away.

“In the future, feel free to talk to myself or any of my staff if you need attention from the Eternal Captains.” Commodore Halee smiled.

“Or just call them yourselves. It’s what I do whenever I have questions.” The medtech snorted, completely oblivious to the junior officer wincing as the three senior officers gave each other *looks.* Yes, medical staff tended to live in their own parallel world, but it was shocking for someone with sergeant stripes to just blurt out something like that around senior brass that he wasn’t familiar with.

“Well we wouldn’t want to cause offense…” Blu’uche’ese started only for the telkan to snort.

“They’re human, and rather direct for humans at that. They won’t care, if anything they’ll appreciate that you’re cutting through the bullshit to take care of things.” The telkan continued as he looked at something in his implants before gently tugging at Ghlark’s shoulder.

Ghlark sighed as he obeyed and kneeled down. “Not that I doubt your expertise, but there haven’t been humans in nearly forty thousand years. How would you know what a human would appreciate?”

“Raised around them. Technically by them.” The medtech answered as he opened up a compartment in Ghlark’s head and started to adjust something. From the sounds the leebawian was making he was too distracted by whatever he was feeling inside his head to follow up with the absurdity the telkan had stated.

Blu’uche’ese on the other hand had no one performing minor followup cyber-surgery under his skull and could easily produce the outrage of several smaller officers. “And how would, how did, I mean, that makes no sense, I mean, HOW!?”

“If I may, Admiral? This was actually addressed during the meeting.”  
  
Blu’uche’ese spun to face the lieutenant that served as Halee’s secretary. The hestlan’s obvious injuries didn’t garner him any sympathy from the annoyed admiral. “Explain.”

Blonk just shrugged. “Moosanto has Born Whole clone technology. They stated they could create telkan clones. How do you know you can create viable clones unless you *create some?* Surgeon Sergeant Cutter was cleared for duty about six hours before Ghlark’s fleet entered the fleet.”

Blu’uche’ese shook his head as he let himself deflate from lanaktallan outrage to simple confusion from trying to understand the implications of the outrageous things he’d just heard.  
  
“Wait, you mean this surgeon is less than a week old!?” Blu’uche’ese gasped while Ghlark did his best to just hold position since the surgeon being discussed had tools inside of his skull.

“Less than a week old physically, closer to fifty in mental age with nearly thirty years of practical experience.” Halee moved to physically stand between Blu’uche’ese’s towering form and the medtech working on Ghlark. “From what I understand, Born Whole clones aren’t just born with knowledge. They live and experience an entire lifetime in a digital world before the clone printer provides them a body in *our* reality. Surgeon Sergeant earned that rank and his accolades at the hand of the *human* trainers in his digital reality. Admiral, what do the histories say of humans giving out accolades that someone doesn’t deserve?”

Blu’uche’ese stopped for a moment to think before he gave an angry snort. “They didn’t.”

“Oh actually they did a lot. Usually right before they stole someone’s wallet or stuck a shiv in their back!” Cutter laughed. “As my wallet remains on me and I only have a couple scars in the back of my clone body…”

“Harrumph. Point made…I think. This is still highly unusual.” Blu’uche’ese grumbled.

Halee grinned “Welcome to Fiishyaahd. We’re used to the weird. Admittedly it’s not usually *this* weird. We’ve had an open pipeline to fill Navy and Marine ranks with in-demand specialists from Moosanto Industries for over a decade. Cutter here is just one of the latest we ordered when we realized the true extent of of cybernetic work that was going to be happening in the system soon. We needed experts and we needed them yesterday, and it takes nearly two weeks for Moosanto to create a new clone.”

“That makes sense.” Blu’uche’ese nodded. “And while I admit and apologize for causing the subject to be brought up in the first place, should we be discussing Sergeant Cut’ter’s heritage in front of him?”

Blonk chuckled. “Sir, a clone that has an existential crisis the first time they realize their childhood was *tailored* is a poor product.”

“Also my name is Cutter, Admiral. No apostrophe, no pause. I was named by Terran Descent Humanity after all.” Cutter explained as he pulled his hand away from Ghlark’s head with several filaments retracting into his cybernetic fingers. “How does that feel, Commodore?”

“Oh goodness, much better, much better! I didn’t even recognize half of what you fixed was wrong, I thought it was just post surgery aches and grogginess! And this is all done with microcircuits?”

“Yes sir, good old fashioned silicon and metal. I still want to watch your vitals for a bit longer but I think I can give you actual space. I should be actually shadowing you now instead of asking you to kneel every two minutes.”

“Much appreciated. Besides, Commodore Halee has promised us something of a show. Wouldn’t want to miss seeing it live, would we Sergeant?”

“Oh absolutely not.” The telkan grinned.

“Ah, and, lieutenant, I’ve only been in the system a few days and heard a few stories about you. You wouldn’t happen to be…” Ghlark asked.

“Don’t be ridiculous. And do not start witch hunts during your stay with us, Commodore.” Halee warned. “Blonk was assigned to me due to the fact tht hestlans that pick a military career, in any service let alone the Navy, are rare and the Navy wanted both of us to be near at least one member of our species. I kept him as my secretarial looie because he graduated top of his class from the naval academy.”

“And…which academy might that be? I don’t remember any in hestlan space.”

“New Stellar Prime Naval Academy, Sir.” Blonk told the leebawian commodore who just nodded.

“I was merely curious.” Ghlark nodded before turning to Halee. “Anyways I believe you said you had something of a show?”

“Technically the *Bronze Cog* has a show, but Prime allows us to tap deeply into his systems.” Halee grinned. “Felt you’d like to see the spectacle of the very first Bronze Cog Games refugee ship leaving the system. And trust me, Prime is going to make this a show.”

\---

Captain Jklee made himself comfortable in the command chair of his new ship. His new, *ancient* ship. He gave a happy chitter as he ran his fingers along the arms of his chair in appreciation before taking a moment to buckle himself in. The launch and flight should be flawless, but why would he take the risk?

“Your coffee, captain?” The monotonal voice of the ship’s computer, CDA, spoke through the speaker in his seat next to his ear, causing Jklee to give a happy squeak as a mug full of steaming caffeine popped out of his seat’s arm-rest.

A mug with the Buildit company logo of a grinning green circle with a hard-hat on it.

“Thank you, Ceeda!” Jklee grinned as he took the mug and sipped at the hot, caffeinated brew that had been tailored to n’karoo biology. “And thank you for giving me something to distract myself with.” He added in a quieter voice.

“It’s only proper care for my captain.” CDA whispered in his implant as he sipped.

Jklee had been doing regular passenger runs in and out of Fiishyaahd for nearly eight years when the Code Zulu had screamed over the hyper-limit. As soon as everyone stopped screaming and Prime took command he immediately contacted the *Bronze Cog* and asked how he could help. Turns out that even though Jklee nor had any of his crew ever done a trial account tour on the ancient ship, when you have a years long of regularly bringing in fresh colonists and tourists to the system (and regularly visited the Eternal Factory museums yourself) meant he and his crew were known by the ancient machine.

Fifteen minutes later Jklee had his offer: The *Bronze Cog* needed captains to helm its vessels. Not Eternal Captains, player captains that could leave the star system.

After three more hours of furious debate, Jklee had accepted the offer with half of his crew. His ship would do another run or two under the command of his executive officer and the remaining crew until it was time for them to get assigned to the new ships.

Jklee snorted in between sips.

“Is there something wrong, Captain?”

“Not at all, Ceeda. Just thinking how this one run will move more people than my old, battered liner would in a decade.”

“Nothing wrong with your old ship or crew. It’s simply a matter of scale.”

Jklee nodded at the Publicly, outwardly, CDA was brusk, rude and downright mean at times. Privately? CDA cared deeply for her crew. Both because she needed them to perform her duties and because she did, personally, care. CDA could run the entire ship herself, but she had been programmed to require a crew outside of emergencies. Jklee was her captain, and CDA was like having an invisible first officer.

It had been quite a shock interacting with so many systems, *active* systems, from the ancient age of wonders. It had also been a busy month of running drills. Everything had to be as perfect as possible, and as *dramatic* as possible.

“Sir! We’ve just received the last shipment from the Pioneers on the surface!”  
  
“Understood.” Jklee nodded as he set his mug down on the platter it had appeared on and watched it disappear and knew the coffee he didn’t drink would be sent to be reclaimed and processed by the nutriforges. Buildit did not waste.

“All right! The Pioneers did their job, it’s up to us!” Jklee called out, raising it to a proper, captainly level. “Everyone get ready to complete the pre-flight checklist!”

“Aye-Aye, Captain!” The crew shouted as everyone ran to their stations. It didn’t take long: everyone was at or at least near to their stations as they knew this moment had been fast approaching.

“Starting pre-flight checklist! Step one, check the oil!”

“Engineering reports oil levels are optimal!”

“Step two, set fuel injection level to five!”

“Fuel injection set to five, Captain!”

“Activate Bus B1”  
  
“Activating Bus B1…Bus B1 Activated!”

\---

“Goodness, this is certainly dramatic!” Blu’uche’ese chuckled. “Never had a flight start like that! Is this what civilians think a bridge is like?”

“Jklee’s an old spacer, but they gave him a script to follow. Remember, this is being touched up and broadcast across the system by the *Cog.* Not that much touchup is necessary for Jklee’s part.” Halee explained as she motioned to one of the secondary monitors that had the post-production transmission on it.

Ghlark grinned as he watched. “To be fair, this is their first flight. And in fact their ship doesn’t seem to even be done being built!”

“What do you mean? It’s all there. It’s a bit round to be sure but…”

“No, admiral, take another look. That’s mostly construction equipment.”

“By the herd, so it is! They’ve staffed the thing before they’ve even put it together!”

\---

“Gyroscopic Stabilization systems X, Y and Z are all online and showing green, Captain!”

“Understood. You heard that Ceeda? It’s time to finally launch Project Construction!”

“Understood. Initiating Project Construction: Construction. Moving to the next stage of the Save the Day Initiative. Attaching cargo to main body.”

\---

Klin’ta and Gl’ria held their squeaking twin children as their cabin moved. To be fair it wasn’t just the small cabin that was moving: the entire section of the ship moved as it was attached to the ship’s hull, which itself was rotated. Gravitic and inertial compensation systems accounted for most of the movement, but not all of it.

“It’s scary mommy!” Their eldest squeaked as they buried their fluffy face in Gl’ria’s metallic blue fur.

“Make it stop, Daddy!” Their youngest cried as they hid themselves against his crystalline fur.

“Yes it is, but not everything that’s scary is bad. Look, you can see on the screen the ship is being built! Soon it will take us out of the system and we’ll be safe from the evil starfish!”

\---

“Control center attached to main body. Running systems check.” CDA stated all of the consoles, screens and holotanks blinked while drones rapidly checked the physical and electrical connections.

“All systems online. Releasing propulsion cage.”

\---

“It’s finally free. Are they going to do a test flight?” Ghlark asked as he heard the ship’s computer system announce it was calculating its flight path.

Halee just grinned. “Ghlark, this is Builder Tech we’re talking about. There is no test flight. This is it.”

“But there’s so many civilians on that ship!” Blu’uche’ese gasped.

“958,028 N’kar of all subspecies. 47,720 Tukna’arn and 12,557 Lanaktallan.” Blonk explained. “1,018,305 refugees, with another five hundred crew and players. 0.7% of the system’s population in one ship.”

“And they’re just…just…just *sending it*!?” Blu’uche’ese bellowed in horror. “You don’t ‘*do it live*’ with over a million souls on the line!”

Halee shrugged. “And yet here we are. I find it more than a little horrifying myself but the control I have over this system is mainly based off of Prime’s good will. You watched the *Cog* fight the mar-gite. You know what that ship alone is capable of, and that’s before you include everything else he’s built since the Code Zulu!”

Halee laughed. “Prime mainly listens to me because I’m *polite!* Besides, look at the ratings Admiral! Can’t you see? He’s an entertainer and *look at those ratings!*”

Blu’uche’ese turned to a 2.5D screen showing the rating information across the system and gasped. “Everyone is watching… *everyone!*”

“Exactly, Admiral. Which is why you should get your game face on. I’ve read the script and they’re only a few lines away from calling us to clear their flight plan.”

\---

Jklee kept his face impassive as he felt the massive engines roar, pushing the gigantic ship clear of its construction cradle. His crew was squeaking and jumping in excitement, but his face was simply content as he rapped his fingers on the rest and his rudder wiggle happily against his crash chair’s padded supports.

Internally he was squealing just as hard in excitement, but a ship's captain had to keep his decorum. Especially when all eyes were on him.

He waited until the ship had cleared a thousand kilometers from the construction cradle before entering the command for the call he needed to make. Technically this call should have been made before the engines had even been lit but his flight path was pre-cleared and this was all in the name of drama.

“Buildit Interstellar Construction Vessel Illusion-1(A-A)Alpha to Stellar Command!”

A moment later the main screen at the front of the bridge shifted, the flight path moving to one corner while the camera feed from the Confederacy Navy command center on Fiishyaahd Prime’s surface. The transmission was immediate with zero travel lag despite the distance between them as Illusion-1(A-A)Alpha launched from the orbit of Twilight Harbor which was in turn orbiting the dwarf star FY-B, while Fiishyaahd Prime orbited the binary system’s primary FY-A.  
  
“Naval Command reads you. This is Commodore Halee. What may we do for you, BICV Illusion?”

Jklee nearly choked as he realized he was talking to the system commander herself. He had expected some photogenic functionary, not *The Commodore!* And behind her were the commanding officers of the fleets who’d helped the *Bronze Cog* fight off the initial Mar-gite probing attack.

“This is BICV Illusion-1(A-A)Alpha, requesting priority clearance from Twilight Harbor orbit, and requesting clearance for least time path for FTL departure.”

“Understood BICV Illusion. Your request is granted: You have priority flight clearance to your least time point. May you forever fly in the Digital Omnimessiah’s Light, Illusion!”

Commodore Halee saluted the screen, saluted Jklee himself. Not only did she salute him, so did every officer behind her. Jklee swallowed and saluted back the best he could as he blinked back tears.

“Thank you, Commodore. We’ll be back as soon as we can. It may look like an ending, but our work today is just the beginning!”

The camera feed cut out and Jklee let out a long breath. He wasn’t stunned for long before he turned to the crew.

“Well you heard her, least time path! Sublight Navigation!”

“Increasing throttle to eighty five percent!”

“FTL Navigation!”

“Warming up the Ballistic Torpedoes!”

\---

Blu’uche’ese let out a breath as the camera feed let out. “Commodore, you told me I was here to see a show, not *be seen!* You should have warned me! My achievement holosash had a crease in it!”

“Just makes it more believable you were here on actual work.” Halee grinned.

“*ARE THEY FIRING WEAPONS!”* Ghlark shouted as he watched the display note several torpedoes had been fired.

Halee’s grin grew wider. “No, that’s their ‘Ballistic Warp Drive’ as they described it to me. They’re creating an external, self-sustaining FTL transit.”

“So, an alcu-berrie drive of sorts?” Blu’uche’ese asked.

“Yes, best I understand it, it’s more like an alcu-berrie drive through jumpspace instead of real-space.”  
  
As Halee spoke all but one of the torpedoes slammed into a pre-determined point to create a massive, unstable spatial distortion. A moment later the last torpedo joined its brethren and suddenly a massive golden tear appeared in space. The tear fought for a moment before collapsing and re-opening as a regular hole with golden rings around a black void.

Everyone watched the ship roar into the black void only for the hole to disappear behind it.

“Goodness, is that even safe?” Blu’uche’ese asked.

“I like it…” Ghlark grinned.

Blu’uche’ese snorted. “Of course you do. You manic little froglings like anything *weird* and I can’t think of anything much weirder than a ‘Ballistic Warp Drive’.”

“Apparently a lot of LARP tech uses those. It’s big, it’s flashy, and you can adjust how the warp portal looks. Anyways, Jklee will drop his load of refugees on planet N’karoo and if all goes well he’ll be back in about three weeks.”

Ghlark gasped and stared at Halee. “Three weeks? Three *weeks!?* My fleet is one of the fastest in the Confederacy and it would take us three *months* to reach the N’karoo homeworld! You’re telling me that ‘Ballistic Drive’ can do that trip in three weeks!?”

“No, it can reach N’karoo, unload its refugees, do some secret thing they won’t tell me, and then be back in three weeks! Well as long as there’s no problems with the planet accepting refugees.”

“Amongst the N’kar?” Blu’uche’ese snorted. “There’s more likely to be fights about not being given enough refugees to care for.”

“I need to get my fleet some of those ballistic drives…” Ghlark gasped.

“Just talk to the *Bronze Cog*, Commodore. They really think it’s a mark of *human* politeness just to call when there’s a problem. Don't try to jump the line or anything and respect office hours, but don't just sit there and tell yourself 'shoulda, woulda, coulda' when there's a problem.”

“I will, I will. After I head back to the infirmary. I’m starting to really feel my surgery and need to take a rest.”

Blu’uche’ese chuckled. “Of course you do. I’ll gladly escort you back: we can’t have you passing out in front of the enlisted after all.”

\---

Blu’uche’ese, Ghlark and Cutter stood in a lift as the admiral and medtech guided the leebawian back to the infirmary with proper gravitas, at least until Ghlark reached out and touched a button to pause the lift.

“Sergeant, a question if I may?”

“Yessir?”

“May I ask where you studied? In your…previous life?”

“Why it was…Uh…oh…” The Cutter stated before he suddenly stared ahead and went quiet.

“Would it happen to have been the New Stellar Prime Naval Academy?”

A pained look rolled across the telkan’s face before he finally let out a grudging “...Yes…”

“Ah, just wanted to be sure.”

Blu’uche’ese looked at the pair in confusion as Ghlark restarted the elevator. “May I ask what that was about?”

“Ah, while we were watching the show I was testing out my new implant with a historical query. I was curious about the naval academy the Commodore’s Lieutenant reported attending. After all, the Confederacy is a *vast* place. It’s why we’re a Confederacy after all: you just cannot have a single government over such a vast distance across so many species and cultures.”

“And?”

“The New Stellar Prime Naval Academy is a real place and has a reputation of being one of the best, if not perhaps the best, naval academy in the Confederacy, at least outside of Terrasol itself.”

“Ah, I’ll have to keep an eye out for any gems from such a prestigious academy. The name sounds utterly human so I suspect it’s definitely not part of Council space.”

“Oh absolutely, though I’m pretty sure this is the best system to find graduates from such an academy.” Ghlark’s grin grew wide and full of teeth as Cutter squirmed. “You see, New Stellar Prime was a city on Alpha Centauri. Humanity’s first interstellar colony. Nothing has been heard from Alpha Centauri besides the shrieks of hungry shades since the TXE.”  
  
Blu’uche’ese gasped and looked at the squirming medtech then back at Ghlark. “Then that means…”  
  
“I also looked up the laws that haven’t been updated since the TXE. Though it makes sense: everyone else hopes and prays humanity will return any day while for you lankies thirty eight thousand years is still practically brand new for a law. He and Cutter here are indeed full, legal citizens of the Confederacy as well as full members of the Confederate armed forces.”  
  
“I…see…” Blu’uche’ese stated, looking at Cutter as the door opened and Ghlark stepped out while humming a tune.

“Or perhaps I don’t?” The admiral sighed as he shook his head. “Ancient machines and mad technologies come to life. They sound so wonderful in the stories but you rarely have to sit back and deal with the ethical and moral implications!” He snarled, grasping at the air with all four hands.

Blu’uche’ese looked down at the strange telkan and sighed. “Sorry for all of that. Welcome aboard to the real…to *our* world I guess? I’m glad to have you.”

“Glad to be here.” Cutter grinned and patted Blu’uche’ese’s flank. “I understand it’s a shock, but you’ll get used to it.”  
  
“Mmmm…May I ask you for your recommendations on what roles I might best seek a Born Whole to fill?”

“Send me what holes you have in your org chart and I’ll see what I can do.”  
  
“Much appreciated. In the meantime, let’s catch the Commodore before he falls over and cracks that ego-swollen head of his open.”",4,1769683124.0,HFY,2,0.84,False
1qq572v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1qq572v/should_i_leave/,Should I leave?,"I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for 2.5 years. You can read my post hx for context but he has been neglecting our relationship for the last 3-4 months. I was begging him to spend ONE night a week with me and he would say he’s too busy. Spending time with friend and family but not me. I was extremely lonely and sad. We went to therapy and he would pretend that he’s going to change and then he wouldn’t.

In the last week he has completely changed and started doing everything I was begging for all these months.

I got suspicious and i confronted him. He confessed to neglecting our relationship because he was upset about a fight we had had and embarrassment he felt. He says he threw himself into work and distracting himself and avoided our relationship. But he has recently realised how wrong that is and wants to change.

In my suspicion I also snooped on his phone and found he has been liking photos of his ex’s, still following them (despite telling me I can’t), messaging other female friends constantly, watching Instagram models and also met up with a girl behind my back for coffee and deleted the evidence.

I don’t know how to feel or what to do. Should I leave my marriage over this? Or do I give him a chance to change?",1,1769683066.0,Separation,1,1.0,False

And the processes involved in 'un-dressing' them and their potential for contamination.

This is another post from the milling & agricultural machinery rabbit holes, looking at threshing, winnowing, cleaning, sorting, tempering / kilning, parboiling & polishing of grains.

The purpose of it is to help you choose grains in the right state of processing to minimise contamination risk & maximise nutrition.

*Naked vs Covered grains*

Grains are 'naked' if their outer hull easily separates from the grain and 'covered' (the technical term for grains that don't come in their birthday suit) if the outer hull is tough and hard to separate from the grain without further processing.

Here's some examples of the two types of grains.

*Naked grains:*

\- Wheat (common and durum, in all their modern cultivars & Kamut-Khorasan variety)

\- Rye

\- Corn

\- Some millet varieties - Finger Millet (Ragi) and Pearl Millet (Bajra)

\- Sorghum (aka Jowar, and often classed under millets)

\- Teff

\- Buckwheat (aka Kasha, if roasted; not a grain, but used as such)

\- Amaranth (also not a grain, but used as such)

\- Naked oats (variety of oats whose hull falls of)

\- Naked barley (same as the naked oats above)



*Covered (or hulled) grains:*

\- Rice

\- Wild rice (not a rice, but a different grain altogether)

\- Barley

\- Oats

\- Ancient wheats  (aka 'the farros': Spelt, Emmer, Einkorn)

\- Some millet varieties (Proso, Foxtail, Barnyard, Little & Browntop millets)

Having a tough to separate hull is obviously a bit of a pain in the ass for the farmer, as you have to work harder to get to what you want - namely the edible grain. Hence cross-breeding efforts over the last 2000+ years or more have focused on selecting grains with easier to remove hull. This is also the reason varieties like ancient wheats have been gradually abandoned once easier to de-hull varieties became available. And are now making a come back - because we have the technology to easily process them.

Fast forward to modern times, most grains are harvested using a combine harvester, with different settings for each (rice is the exception - depending on how wet and large the paddy is, the work may need to be manual).

It 'combines' 3 processes in one: reaping (cutting the grain stalk), threshing ('beating' the grain to remove it from the husk and other inedible parts) and winnowing (separating the grain from the chaff by blowing air through it). The same process was done manually back in the day, requiring a ton of work.

Naked grains end up relatively clean & ready to go straight off the combine harvester. Covered grains do not and require more processing to make them edible.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Naked grains processing*

Even naked grains won't get to your kitchen as they came out of the combine! There is more sorting & cleaning involved to make sure you don't have any chaff or stones coming your way.

Here's a schema of what goes on (left hand side - for cleaning) + packaging on packing line:

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Wheat-cleaning-and-milling-process-diagram-Cleaning-steps-in-green-boxes-indicate-where\_fig14\_273897910](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Wheat-cleaning-and-milling-process-diagram-Cleaning-steps-in-green-boxes-indicate-where_fig14_273897910)

The question here is - are naked grains contaminated? The likely answer is no, or very little. Although any part of this processing may involve plastics, the following also apply:

\- the grain itself is intact. It is not acidic or sticky. As the bran & germ are not damaged, the oil in the grain is unlikely to spread & coat the grain and increase its chances of picking up plasticisers along the way.

\- there is no heat treatment involved to potentially release some of the oil in the grain.

Naked grains are safe.

But of course, you can take it a step further & get the grain un-cleaned or very lightly cleaned. That's no trouble if stone milling - the coarsest of sieves will get rid of the extra bran. But of course no good for any other grain uses. I had come across un-cleaned grain and did not make any difference to my appetite compared to the regular.

Covered grains on the other hand...

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Covered grains processing*

Covered grains come out of the combine with the hull still intact and further processing is required to get to an edible result. That type of processing varies depending on the grain, but it is usually one of the following:

\- polishing in a roller mill (rice, millets, barley)

\- parboiling / kilning or other such heat treatments (traditional rice, oats).

Polishing (rice milling) is pretty straightforward - the grain is passed through a number of abrassive surfaces to clean out the hull. The result is either full removal of the hull & germ (as in white rice, pearl barley and polished millets) or partial removal (as in brown rice, pot barley, semi-polished rice / millet). This is how the vast majority of white & brown rice is produced

From a nutritional perspective, people are tempted to go for the partial removal options, such as brown rice, hoping that at least some of the germ is still there providing some micronutrients. That is not always the case, because having the germ still there reduces the shelf life of the product dramatically - so manufacturers may decide to polish just enough to remove it.

But even if the germ is in, the other problem with this process (which I have discovered time & time again) is that part-removal of bran increases plasticiser contamination risk, because now you have a damaged germ, oozing the oil of the grain out (which is also what causes the rancidity & reduced shelf life).

I have figured this out after scratching my head at why flatbread made from wheat makes me full, while flatbread made from barley & spelt makes me ravenous. Same recipe for all 3 - containing just grain, water & yeast. And ditched the barley & the spelt - wheat will do!

Things get worse when it comes to things like oats  part polished parboiled rice that require kilning / heat treatment. Now you have the oily grain, heated that goes through processing. For oats, it totally does not help that they're 9% fat.

I always found porridge one of the least satiating foods ever & wondered why is it that's the recommended, filling option for a 'dieting' breakfast. Is this some sick joke at dieters' expense?

It never kept me full! Even when using pinhead oats. In fact, pinhead oats & whole oat groats were the worse - could not stop eating them. Because the oat flakes (usually available in shops for porridge) are heat treated once more & stripped of their oil (and contaminants) before you eat them.

I recently had coffee with oat milk & got reminded very sharply of that fact - ate 600kcal more that day than the previous week's average, while the rest of food eaten was pretty much the same.

But no such problems with whole \*naked oats\* porridge, which is just as satiating as wheat. The difference processing makes!

I did for a short time consider switching white rice for traditional types, typically parboiled and left whole or semi-polished. For these, paddy rice is heated & steamed first, then polished. But after realising the extent of processing I don't fancy taking my chances - white rice will do, I'll get the extra nutrition elsewhere.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*Choose your grains wisely*

Naked grains are by far the safest choice.

If you fancy the covered grains, such as rice, stick to the fully polished versions, such as white rice. The extra fibre & potentially nutrients if germ's still in may not be worth the extra contamination risk.

Oats are unfortunatelly off the menu, unless naked.
