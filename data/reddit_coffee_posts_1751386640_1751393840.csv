1lp91l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lp91l1/feed_by_mira_grant/,Feed by Mira Grant:,"Our story opens where countless stories have ended in the last twenty-six years: with an idiot—in this case, my brother Shaun—deciding it would be a good idea to go out and poke a zombie with a stick to see what happens. As if we didn’t already know what happens when you mess with a zombie: The zombie turns around and bites you, and you become the thing you poked. This isn’t a surprise. It hasn’t been a surprise for more than twenty years, and if you want to get technical, it wasn’t a surprise then.  
  
  When the infected first appeared—heralded by screams that the dead were rising and judgment day was at hand—they behaved just like the horror movies had been telling us for decades that they would behave. The only surprise was that this time, it was really happening.  
  
  There was no warning before the outbreaks began. One day, things were normal; the next, people who were supposedly dead were getting up and attacking anything that came into range. This was upsetting for everyone involved, except for the infected, who were past being upset about that sort of thing. The initial shock was followed by running and screaming, which eventually devolved into more infection and attacking, that being the way of things. So what do we have now, in this enlightened age twenty-six years after the Rising? We have idiots prodding zombies with sticks, which brings us full circle to my brother and why he probably won’t live a long and fulfilling life.  
  
  “Hey, George, check this out!” he shouted, giving the zombie another poke in the chest with his hockey stick. The zombie gave a low moan, swiping at him ineffectually. It had obviously been in a state of full viral amplification for some time and didn’t have the strength or physical dexterity left to knock the stick out of Shaun’s hands. I’ll give Shaun this much: He knows not to bother the fresh ones at close range. “We’re playing patty-cake!”  
  
  “Stop antagonizing the locals and get back on the bike,” I said, glaring from behind my sunglasses. His current buddy might be sick enough to be nearing its second, final death, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t a healthier pack roaming the area. Santa Cruz is zombie territory. You don’t go there unless you’re suicidal, stupid, or both. There are times when even I can’t guess which of those options applies to Shaun.  
  
  “Can’t talk right now! I’m busy making friends with the locals!”  
  
  “Shaun Phillip Mason, you get back on this bike right now, or I swear to God, I am going to drive away and leave you here.”  
  
  Shaun looked around, eyes bright with sudden interest as he planted the end of his hockey stick at the center of the zombie’s chest to keep it at a safe distance. “Really? You’d do that for me? Because ‘My Sister Abandoned Me in Zombie Country Without a Vehicle’ would make a great article.”  
  
  “A posthumous one, maybe,” I snapped. “Get back on the goddamn bike!”  
  
  “In a minute!” he said, laughing, and turned back toward his moaning friend.  
  
  In retrospect, that’s when everything started going wrong.  
  
  The pack had probably been stalking us since before we hit the city limits, gathering reinforcements from all over the county as they approached. Packs of infected get smarter and more dangerous the larger they become. Groups of four or less are barely a threat unless they can corner you, but a pack of twenty or more stands a good chance of breaching any barrier the uninfected try to put up. You get enough of the infected together and they’ll start displaying pack hunting techniques; they’ll start using actual tactics. It’s like the virus that’s taken them over starts to reason when it gets enough hosts in the same place. It’s scary as hell, and it’s just about the worst nightmare of anyone who regularly goes into zombie territory—getting cornered by a large group that knows the land better than you do.  
  
  These zombies knew the land better than we did, and even the most malnourished and virus-ridden pack knows how to lay an ambush. A low moan echoed from all sides, and then they were shambling into the open, some moving with the slow lurch of the long infected, others moving at something close to a run. The runners led the pack, cutting off three of the remaining methods of escape before there was time to do more than stare. I looked at them and shuddered.  
  
  Fresh infected—really fresh ones—still look almost like the people that they used to be. Their faces show emotion, and they move with a jerkiness that could just mean they slept wrong the night before. It’s harder to kill something that still looks like a person, and worst of all, the bastards are fast. The only thing more dangerous than a fresh zombie is a pack of them, and I counted at least eighteen before I realized that it didn’t matter, and stopped bothering.  
  
  I grabbed my helmet and shoved it on without fastening the strap. If the bike went down, dying because my helmet didn’t stay on would be one of the better options. I’d reanimate, but at least I wouldn’t be aware of it. “Shaun!”  
  
  Shaun whipped around, staring at the emerging zombies. “Whoa.”  
  
  Unfortunately for Shaun, the addition of that many zombies had turned his buddy from a stupid solo into part of a thinking mob. The  
zombie grabbed the hockey stick as soon as Shaun’s attention was focused elsewhere, yanking it out of his hands. Shaun staggered forward and the zombie latched onto his cardigan, withered fingers locking down with deceptive strength. It hissed. I screamed, images of my inevitable future as an only child filling my mind.  
  
  “Shaun!” One bite and things would get a lot worse. There’s not much worse than being cornered by a pack of zombies in downtown Santa Cruz. Losing Shaun would qualify.  
  
  The fact that my brother convinced me to take a dirt bike into zombie territory doesn’t make me an idiot. I was wearing full off-road body armor, including a leather jacket with steel armor joints attached at the elbows and shoulders, a Kevlar vest, motorcycling pants with hip and knee protectors, and calf-high riding boots. It’s bulky as hell, and I don’t care, because once you factor in my gloves, my throat’s the only target I present in the field.  
  
  Shaun, on the other hand, is a moron and had gone zombie baiting in nothing more defensive than a cardigan, a Kevlar vest, and cargo pants. He won’t even wear goggles—he says they “spoil the effect.” Unprotected mucous membranes can spoil a hell of a lot more than that, but I practically have to blackmail him to get him into the Kevlar. Goggles are a nonstarter.  
  
  There’s one advantage to wearing a sweater in the field, no matter how idiotic I think it is: wool tears. Shaun ripped himself free and turned, running for the motorcycle with great speed, which is really the only effective weapon we have against the infected. Not even the fresh ones can keep up with an uninfected human over a short sprint. We have speed, and we have bullets. Everything else about this fight is in their favor.  
  
  “Shit, George, we’ve got company!” There was a perverse mixture of horror and delight in his tone. “Look at ‘em all!”  
  
  “I’m looking! Now get on!”  
  
  I kicked us free as soon as he had his leg over the back of the bike and his arm around my waist. The bike leapt forward, tires bouncing and shuddering across the broken ground as I steered us into a wide curve. We needed to get out of there, or all the protective gear in the world wouldn’t do us a damn bit of good. I might live if the zombies caught up with us, but my brother would be dragged into the mob. I gunned the throttle, praying that God had time to preserve the life of the clinically suicidal.  
  
  We hit the last open route out of the square at twenty miles an hour, still gathering speed. Whooping, Shaun locked one arm around my waist and twisted to face the zombies, waving and blowing kisses in their direction. If it were possible to enrage a mob of the infected, he’d have managed it. As it was, they just moaned and kept following, arms extended toward the promise of fresh meat.  
  
  The road was pitted from years of weather damage without maintenance. I fought to keep control as we bounced from pothole to pothole. “Hold on, you idiot!”  
  
  “I’m holding on!” Shaun called back, seeming happy as a clam and oblivious to the fact that people who don’t follow proper safety procedures around zombies—like not winding up around zombies in the first place—tend to wind up in the obituaries.  
  
  “Hold on with both arms!” The moaning was only coming from three sides now, but it didn’t mean anything; a pack this size was almost certainly smart enough to establish an ambush. I could be driving straight to the site of greatest concentration. They’d moan in the end, once we were right on top of them. No zombie can resist a good moan when dinner’s at hand. The fact that I could hear them over the engine meant that there were too many, too close. If we were lucky, it wasn’t already too late to get away.  
  
  Of course, if we were lucky, we wouldn’t be getting chased by an army of zombies through the quarantine area that used to be downtown Santa Cruz. We’d be somewhere safer, like Bikini Atoll just before the bomb testing kicked off. Once you decide to ignore the hazard rating and the signs saying Danger: Infection, you’re on your own.  
  
  Shaun grudgingly slid his other arm around my waist and linked his hands at the pit of my stomach, shouting, “Spoilsport,” as he settled.  
  
  I snorted and hit the gas again, aiming for a nearby hill. When you’re being chased by zombies, hills are either your best friends or your burial ground. The slope slows them down, which is great, unless you hit the peak and find out that you’re surrounded, with nowhere left to run to.  
  
  Idiot or not, Shaun knows the rules about zombies and hills. He’s not as dumb as he pretends to be, and he knows more about surviving zombie encounters than I do. His grip on my waist tightened, and for the first time, there was actual concern in his voice as he shouted, “George? What do you think you’re doing?”  
  
  “Hold, on,” I said. Then we were rolling up the hill, bringing more zombies stumbling out of their hiding places behind trash cans and in the spaces between the once-elegant beachfront houses that were now settling into a state of neglected decay.  
  
  Most of California was reclaimed after the Rising, but no one has ever managed to take back Santa Cruz. The geographical isolation that once made the town so desirable as a vacation spot pretty much damned it when the virus hit. Kellis-Amberlee may be unique in the way it interacts with the human body, but it behaves just like every other communicable disease known to man in at least one way: Put it on a school campus and it spreads like wildfire. U.C. Santa Cruz was a perfect breeding ground, and once all those perky co-eds became the shuffling infected, it was all over but the evacuation notices.  
  
  “Georgia, this is a hill!” he said with increasing urgency as the locals lunged toward the speeding bike. He was using my proper name; that was how I could tell he was worried. I’m only “Georgia” when he’s unhappy.  
  
  “I got that.” I hunched over to decrease wind resistance a few more precious degrees. Shaun mimicked the motion automatically, hunching down behind me.  
  
  “Why are we going up a hill?” he demanded. There was no way he’d be able to hear my answer over the combined roaring of the engine and the wind, but that’s my brother, always willing to question that which won’t talk back.  
  
  “Ever wonder how the Wright brothers felt?” I asked. The crest of the hill was in view. From the way the street vanished on the other side, it was probably a pretty steep drop. The moaning was coming from all sides now, so distorted by the wind that I had no real idea what we were driving into. Maybe it was a trap; maybe it wasn’t. Either way, it was too late to find another path. We were committed, and for once, Shaun was the one sweating.  
  
  “Georgia!”  
  
  “Hold on!” Ten yards. The zombies kept closing, single-minded in their pursuit of what might be the first fresh meat some had seen in years. From the looks of most of them, the zombie problem in Santa Cruz was decaying faster than it was rebuilding itself. Sure, there were plenty of fresh ones—there are always fresh ones because there are always idiots who wander into quarantined zones, either willingly or by mistake, and the average hitchhiker doesn’t get lucky where zombies are concerned—but we’ll take the city back in another three generations. Just not today.  
  
  Five yards.  
  
  Zombies hunt by moving toward the sound of other zombies hunting. It’s recursive, and that meant our friends at the base of the hill started for the peak when they heard the commotion. I was hoping so many of the locals had been cutting us off at ground level that they wouldn’t have many bodies left to mount an offensive on the hill’s far side. We weren’t supposed to make it that far, after all; the only thing keeping us alive was the fact that we had a motorcycle and the zombies didn’t.  
  
  I glimpsed the mob waiting for us as we reached the top. They were standing no more than three deep. Fifteen feet would see us clear.  
  
  Liftoff.  
  
  It’s amazing what you can use for a ramp, given the right motivation. Someone’s collapsed fence was blocking half the road, jutting up at an angle, and I hit it at about fifty miles an hour. The handlebars shuddered in my hands like the horns of a mechanical bull, and the shocks weren’t doing much better. I didn’t even have to check the road in front of  
us because the moaning started as soon as we came into view. They’d blocked our exit fairly well while Shaun played with his little friend, and mindless plague carriers or not, they had a better grasp of the local geography than we did. We still had one advantage: Zombies aren’t good at predicting suicide charges. And if there’s a better term for driving up the side of a hill at fifty miles an hour with the goal of actually achieving flight when you run out of “up,” I don’t think I want to hear it.  
  
  The front wheel rose smoothly and the back followed, sending us into the air with a jerk that looked effortless and was actually scarier than hell. I was screaming. Shaun was whooping with gleeful understanding. And then everything was in the hands of gravity, which has never had much love for the terminally stupid. We hung in the air for a heart-stopping moment, still shooting forward. At least I was fairly sure the impact would kill us.  
  
  The laws of physics and the hours of work I’ve put into constructing and maintaining my bike combined to let the universe, for once, show mercy. We soared over the zombies, coming down on one of the few remaining stretches of smooth road with a bone-bruising jerk that nearly ripped the handlebars out of my grip. The front wheel went light on impact, trying to rise up, and I screamed, half terrified, half furious with Shaun for getting us into this situation in the first place. The handlebars shuddered harder, almost wrenching my arms out of their sockets before I hit the gas and forced the wheel back down. I’d pay for this in the morning, and not just with the repair bills.  
  
  Not that it mattered. We were on level ground, we were upright, and there was no moaning ahead. I hit the gas harder as we sped toward the outskirts of town, with Shaun whooping and cheering behind me like a big suicidal freak.  
  
  “Asshole,” I muttered, and drove on.  
  
  News is news and spin is spin, and when you introduce the second to the first, what you have isn’t news anymore. Hey, presto, you’ve created opinion.  
 Don’t get me wrong, opinion is powerful. Being able to be presented with differing opinions on the same issue is one of the glories of a free media, and it should make people stop and think. But a lot of people don’t want to. They don’t want to admit that whatever line being touted by their idol of the moment might not be unbiased and without ulterior motive. We’ve got people who claim Kellis-Amberlee was a plot by the Jews, the gays, the Middle East, even a branch of the Aryan Nation trying to achieve racial purity by killing the rest of us. Whoever orchestrated the creation and release of the virus masked their involvement with a conspiracy of Machiavellian proportions, and now they and their followers are sitting it out, peacefully immunized, waiting for the end of the world.  
  
  Pardon the expression, but I can smell the bullshit from here. Conspiracy? Cover up? I’m sure there are groups out there crazy enough to think killing thirty-two percent of the world’s population in a single summer is a good idea—and remember, that’s a conservative estimate, since we’ve never gotten accurate death tolls out of Africa, Asia, or parts of South America—but are any of them nuts enough to do it by turning what used to be Grandma loose to chew on people at random? Zombies don’t respect conspiracy. Conspiracy is for the living.  
  
  This piece is opinion. Take it as you will. But get your opinions the hell away from my news.  
  
  —From Images May Disturb You, the blog of Georgia Mason, September 3, 2039  
  
  Zombies are pretty harmless as long as you treat them with respect. Some people say you should pity the zombie, empathize with the zombie, but I think they? Are likely to become the zombie, if you get my meaning. Don’t feel sorry for the zombie. The zombie’s not going to feel sorry for you when he starts gnawing on your head. Sorry, dude, but not even my sister gets to know me that well.  
  
  If you want to deal with zombies, stay away from the teeth, don’t let them scratch you, keep your hair short, and don’t wear loose clothes. It’s that simple. Making it more complicated would be boring, and who wants that? We have what basically amounts to walking corpses, dude.  
  
  Don’t suck all the fun out of it.  
  
  —From Hail to the King, the blog of Shaun Mason, January 2, 2039

  Neither of us spoke as we drove through the remains of Santa Cruz. There were no signs of movement, and the buildings were getting widely spaced enough that visual tracking was at least partially reliable. I started to relax as I took the first exit onto Highway 1, heading south. From there, we could cut over to Highway 152, which would take us into Watsonville, where we’d left the van.  
  
  Watsonville is another of Northern California’s “lost towns.” It was surrendered to the infected after the summer of 2014, but it’s safer than Santa Cruz, largely due to its geographical proximity to Gilroy, which is still a protected farming community. This means that while no one’s willing to live in Watsonville for fear that the zombies will shamble down from Santa Cruz in the middle of the night, the good people of Gilroy aren’t willing to let the infected have it either. They go in three times a year with flamethrowers and machine guns and clean the place out. That keeps Watsonville deserted, and lets the California farmers continue to feed the population.  
  
  I pulled off to the side of the road outside the ruins of a small town called Aptos, near the Highway 1 onramp. There was flat ground in all directions, giving us an adequate line of sight on anything that might be looking for a snack. My bike was running rough enough that I wanted to get a good look at it, and adding more gas probably wouldn’t hurt. Dirt bikes have small tanks, and we’d covered a lot of miles already.  
  
  Shaun turned toward me as he dismounted, grinning from ear to ear. The wind had raked his hair into a series of irregular spikes and snarls, making him look like he’d been possessed. “That,” he said, with almost religious fervor, “was the coolest thing you have ever done. In fact, that may have been the coolest thing you ever will do. Your entire existence has been moving toward one shining moment, George, and that was the moment when you thought, ‘Hey, why don’t I just go over the zombies?’ ” He paused for effect. “You are possibly cooler than God.”  
  
  “Yet another chance to be free of you, down the drain.” I hopped off the bike and pulled off my helmet, starting to assess the most obvious problems. They looked minor, but I still intended to get them looked at as soon as possible. Some damage was beyond my admittedly limited mechanical capabilities, and I was sure I’d managed to cause most of it.  
  
  “You’ll get another one.”  
  
  “That’s the hope that keeps me going.” I balanced my helmet against the windscreen before unzipping the right saddlebag and removing the gas can. Setting the can on the ground, I pulled out the first-aid kit. “Blood test time.”  
  
  “George—”  
  
  “You know the rules. We’ve been in the field, and we don’t go back to base until we’ve checked our virus levels.” I extracted two small handheld testing units, holding one out to him. “No levels, no van. No van, no coffee. No coffee, no joy. Do you want the joy, Shaun, or would you rather stand out here and argue with me about whether you’re going to let me test your blood?”  
  
  “You’re burning cool by the minute here,” he grumbled, and took the unit.  
  
  “I’m okay with that,” I said. “Now let’s see if I’ll live.”  
  
  Moving with synchronicity born of long practice, we broke the biohazard seals and popped the plastic lids off our testing units, exposing the sterile metal pressure pads. Basic field test units only work once, but they’re cheap and necessary. You need to know if someone’s gone into viral amplification—preferably before they start chewing on your tasty flesh.  
  
  I unsnapped my right glove and peeled it off, shoving it into my pocket. “On three?.......

1lp8yq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lp8yq4/the_fireman_read_by_joe_hill/,The Fireman Read by Joe Hill:,"She did not leave the school until an hour after the last child had gone home, but even so she was departing early. Most school days she was required to stay until five, for the fifty or so children who hung around for extended hours while their parents worked. Today, everyone was gone by three.  
  
  After she shut off the lights in the nurse’s office, she stood at the window and looked out into the playground. There was a black spot by the jungle gym where the fire department had hosed away the charred bits that couldn’t be scraped up. She had a premonition she would never return to her office and look out this window again, and she was right. School was suspended statewide that evening, with assurances they would reopen when the crisis passed. As it happened, it never passed.  
  
  Harper imagined she would have the house to herself, but when she got home, Jakob was already there. He had the TV on, turned low, and was on the phone with someone. From his tone—calm, steady, almost lazy—a person would never guess Jakob was in a state of excitement. You had to see him pacing to know he was keyed up.  
  
  “No, I didn’t see it myself. Johnny Deepenau was down there in one of the town trucks, pushing the debris out of the road, and he sent us pictures from his cell phone. It looked like a bomb went off inside. It looked like terrorism, like . . . hang on. Harp just walked in.” Her husband lowered the phone, pressed it to his chest, and said, “You came home the back way, didn’t you? I know you didn’t come through downtown. They’ve got the roads all sewed up from North Church to the library. The whole town is crawling with cops and National Guard. A bus exploded into flames and crashed into a telephone pole. It was full of Chinese people infected with that shit, the Dragonscale shit.” He let out a long, unsteady breath and shook his head—as if it shocked him, the nerve of some people, igniting in the middle of Portsmouth on such a nice day—and turned from her, put the phone back to his ear. “She’s fine. Didn’t know a thing about it. She’s home and we’re going to have a good old shouting match if she thinks I’m letting her go back to work anytime soon.”  
  
  Harper sat on the edge of the couch and looked at the TV. It was tuned to the local news. They were showing footage from last night’s Celtic game, just like nothing was happening. Isaiah Thomas rose up on his toes, fell backward, and let go of the basketball, hit a shot from nearly half court. They didn’t know it then, but by the end of the following week, the basketball season would be over. Come summer, most of the Celtics would be dead, by incineration or suicide.  
  
  Jakob paced in his rope sandals.  
  
  “What? No. No one got off,” he said into the phone. “And it may sound harsh, but there’s a part of me that’s glad. No one to pass it on.” He listened for a bit and then, unexpectedly, laughed and said, “Who ordered the flaming pupu platter, right?”  
  
  His pacing had taken him all the way across the room to the bookshelf, where there was nothing to do but circle around and come back. As he turned, his gaze drifted to Harper again and this time he saw something that stiffened his back.  
  
  “Hey, babygirl, are you all right?” he asked her.  
  
  She stared at him. She couldn’t think how to reply. It was a curiously difficult question, one that required a certain amount of introspection.  
  
  “Hey, Danny? I have to go. I want to sit with Harper for a minute. You did the right thing, going to pick up your kids.” He paused, then added, “Yes, all right. I’ll send you and Claudia the pictures, but you didn’t get them from me. Love to you both.”  
  
  He ended the call, lowered the phone, and looked at her. “What’s wrong? Why are you home?”  
  
  “There was a man behind the school,” Harper said, and then a wedge of something—an emotion like a physical mass—stuck in her throat.  
  
  He sat down with her and put a hand on her back.  
  
  “Okay,” he said. “It’s okay.”  
  
  The pressure on her windpipe relaxed and she found her voice, was able to start again. “He was in the playground, staggering around like a drunk. Then he fell down and caught fire. He burned up like he was made of straw. Half the kids in school saw it. You can see into the playground from almost every classroom. I’ve been treating kids in shock all afternoon.”  
  
  “You should’ve told me. You should’ve made me get off the phone.”  
  
  She turned to him and rested her head on his chest while he held her.  
  
  “At one point I had forty kids in the gym, and a few teachers, and the principal, and some were crying, and some were shivering, and some were throwing up, and I felt like doi  
ng all three at the same time.”  
  
  “But you didn’t.”  
  
  “No. I passed out juice boxes. Cutting-edge medical treatment, right there.”  
  
  “You did what you could,” he said. “You got who knows how many kids through the most awful thing they’ll ever see in their lives. You know that, don’t you? They’re going to remember the way you looked after them the rest of their lives. And you did it and now it’s behind you and you’re here with me.”  
  
  For a while she was quiet and motionless inside the circle of his arms, inhaling his particular odor of sandalwood cologne and coffee.  
  
  “When did it happen?” He let go of her, regarded her steadily with his almond-colored eyes.  
  
  “First period.”  
  
  “It’s going on three. Did you eat lunch?”  
  
  “Uhn-uh.”  
  
  “Light-headed?”  
  
  “Uh-huh.”  
  
  “Let’s get some food into you. I don’t know what’s in the fridge. I can order us something, maybe.”  
  
  Who ordered the flaming pupu platter? Harper thought, and the room tilted like the deck of a ship. She steadied herself on the back of the couch.  
  
  “Maybe just some water,” she said.  
  
  “How about wine?”  
  
  “Even better.”  
  
  He got up and crossed to the little six-bottle wine cooler on the shelf. As he looked at one bottle, then another—what kind of wine did you pair with a fatal contagion?—he said, “I thought this stuff was only in countries where the pollution is so thick you can’t breathe the air and the rivers are open sewers. China. Russia. The Former Communist Republic of Turdistan.”  
  
  “Rachel Maddow said there’s almost a hundred cases in Detroit. She was talking about it last night.”  
  
  “That’s what I mean. I thought it was only in filthy places no one wants to go, like Chernobyl and Detroit.” A cork popped. “I don’t understand why someone carrying it would get on a bus. Or a plane.”  
  
  “Maybe they were afraid of being quarantined. The idea of being kept from your loved ones is scarier than the sickness for a lot of people. No one wants to die alone.”  
  
  “Yeah, that’s right. Why die alone when you can have company? Nothing says ‘I love you’ like passing along a horrible fucking fatal infection to your nearest and dearest.” He brought her a glass of golden wine, like a cup of distilled sunshine. “If I had it I’d rather die than give it to you. Than put you at risk. I think it would actually be easier to end my own life, knowing I was doing it to keep other people safe. I can’t imagine anything more irresponsible than going around with something like that.” He gave her the glass, stroking one of her fingers as he passed it to her. He had a kind touch, a knowing touch; it was the best thing about him, his intuitive feel for just when to push a strand of her hair behind her ear, or smooth the fine down on the nape of her neck. “How easy is it to catch this stuff? It’s transmitted like athlete’s foot, isn’t it? As long as you wash your hands and don’t walk around the gym in bare feet, you’re fine? Hey. Hey. You didn’t go close to the dead guy, did you?”  
No.” Harper did not bother to stick her nose in the glass and inhale the French bouquet as Jakob had taught her, when she was twenty-three and freshly laid and more drunk on him than she would ever be on wine. She polished off her sauvignon blanc in two swallows.  
  
  He sank down next to her with a sigh and shut his eyes. “Good. That’s good. You have a horrible need to look after people, Harper, which is fine in ordinary circumstances, but in some situations a girl has to look after—”  
  
  But she wasn’t listening. She had frozen, leaning forward to set her wineglass on the coffee table. On the TV, the program had cut away from hockey highlights to an old man in a gray suit, a newscaster with shy blue eyes behind his bifocals. The banner across the bottom of the screen said BREAKING NEWS SPACE NEEDLE ON FIRE.  
  
  “—going to Seattle,” the anchor said. “Be warned, the footage is very graphic and upsetting. If there are children in the room they should not look.”  
  
  Before he was done talking NECN cut to helicopter footage of the Needle, reaching up to jab at a bright, cold, blue sky. Black smoke filled the interior and boiled from the windows, so much that it obscured many of the other helicopters circling the scene.  
  
  “Oh my God,” Jakob said.  
  
  A man in a white shirt and black pants leapt from one of the open windows. His hair was on fire. His arms pinwheeled as he dropped out of frame. He was followed seconds later by a woman in a dark skirt. When she jumped, she clasped her hands to her thighs, as if to keep her skirt from flapping up and showing her underwear.  
  
  Jakob took Harper’s hand. She threaded her fingers through his and squeezed.  
  
  “What the fuck is happening, Harper?” he asked. “What the fuck is this?”  
  
  MAY–JUNE

  FOX said the Dragon had been set loose by ISIS, using spores that had been invented by the Russians in the 1980s. MSNBC said sources indicated the ’scale might’ve been created by engineers at Halliburton and stolen by culty Christian types fixated on the Book of Revelation. CNN reported both sides.  
  
  All throughout May and June, there were roundtable discussions on every channel, in between live reports from places that were in flames.  
  
  Then Glenn Beck burned to death on his Internet program, right in front of his chalkboard, burned so hot his glasses fused to his face, and after that most of the news was less about who did it and more about how not to catch it.  
  
  JULY  
  
  3  
  
  There was a fireman causing trouble.  
  
  “Sir,” said Nurse Lean. “Sir, you can’t cut the line. You’ll have your free examination when it’s your turn.”  
  
  The Fireman glanced over his shoulder at the line that stretched down the hall and around the corner. Then he looked back. His face was filthy and he wore the same yellow rubber jacket all the firemen wore and he had a child in his arms, a boy, hugging him around the neck.  
  
  “I’m not checking in. I’m dropping off,” he said, and his accent made people look. You didn’t expect a New Hampshire fireman to sound like he was from London. “And it’s not about what they’re here for. This isn’t about the mold. My boy needs to see a doctor. He needs him now, not in two hours. This is an emergency. I don’t see why I can’t make anyone here in this so-called emergency room understand that.”  
  
  Harper was passing along the line, handing out lollipops and paper cups of apple juice to the little kids. She also had a radish in one pocket and a potato in the other, for the most seriously unhappy children.  
  
  The sound of an English accent distracted her and lifted her spirits. She associated English accents with singing teapots, schools for witchcraft, and the science of deduction. This wasn’t, she knew, terribly sophisticated of her, but she had no real guilt about it. She felt the English were themselves to blame for her feelings. They had spent a century relentlessly marketing their detectives and wizards and nannies, and they had to live with the results.  
  
  Her spirits needed lifting. She had spent the morning stowing charred corpses in body bags, their blackened, shriveled tissues still warm to the touch, still fuming. Because the hospital was running out of bags, she had to pack a pair of dead children into a sack together, which wasn’t so hard. They had burned to death with their arms around one another, had fused into a single creature, a tangled cat’s cradle of charred bones. It looked like death metal sculpture.  
  
  She hadn’t been home since the last week in June and spent eighteen hours out of twenty-four in a full-body rubber suit that had been designed to repel Ebola. The gloves were so tight she had to lube her hands up with petroleum jelly to get them on. She stank like a prophylactic. Every time she inhaled her own fragrance of rubber and K-Y she thought of awkward college encounters in the dorms.  
  
  Harper made her way toward the head of the line, approaching the Fireman from behind. It was her job to keep the people who were waiting content, not Nurse Lean’s, and Harper didn’t want to wind up on Nurse Lean’s bad side. Harper had only been working under her, at Portsmouth Hospital, for three weeks, and was a little afraid of her. All the volunteer nurses were.  
  
  “Sir,” Nurse Lean said now, in a voice thin with impatience. “Everyone in this line is having an emergency. It’s emergencies all the way back to the lobby. We take ’em in the order they come.”  
  
  The Fireman peered over his shoulder at the line. A hundred and thirty-one of them (Harper had counted), weary and stained with Dragonscale and staring back at him with hollow-eyed resentment.  
  
  “Their emergencies can wait. This boy’s cannot.” He snapped back around to face Nurse Lean. “Let me try this another way.”  
  
  His right arm hung at his side. He held a tool close against it, between his arm and body, a rusty iron bar, with hooks and prongs and hatchet blades bristling from either end. He opened his hand and let the bar slide down into full view, so that one end was almost touching the dirty linoleum. He waggled it but did not raise it.  
  
  “Either you let me through that door or I take this halligan and begin smashing things. I will start with a window and work my way up to a computer. Get a doctor, or let me by, but do not imagine I am going to wait in line while this nine-year-old boy dies in my arms.”  
  
  Albert Holmes made his lazy way down the hall, coming from the double doors that led into the pre-quarantine exam rooms. He wore an Ebola suit, too. The only thing that marked Al out as different from the medical staff was that instead of a rubber hood, he had on a black riot helmet, the glass faceplate pulled down. He also wore his belt on the outside of his suit, his security badge and his walkie-talkie on one hip, his Teflon nightstick on the other.  
  
  Harper and Al closed in at the same time, from opposite directions.  
  
  “Let’s settle down here,” Al said. “Listen, bud, we can’t have you in here with that—what’d you call it? The hooligan thing. Fire personnel have to leave their equipment outside.”  
  
  “Sir? If you’ll come with me, I’d be glad to talk to you about your son’s complaint,” Harper said.  
  
  “He’s not my son,” said the Fireman, “and I’m not his hysterical father. What I am is a man with a dangerously ill child and a heavy iron bar. If someone doesn’t take the one, they’re going to get the other. You want to talk to me? Talk where? Through those doors where the doctors are, or at the end of the line?”  
  
  She held his gaze, willing him to be good, promising him with her eyes that she would be good to him in return, she would listen and deal with him and his boy with warmth, humor, and patience. Telling him that she was trying to protect him, because if he didn’t chill out he was going to wind up facedown on the floor with pepper spray in his eyes and a boot on his neck. Harper had been on staff for less than a month, but that was long enough to become accustomed to the sight of security drubbing unruly patients into better behavior.  
  
  “Come with me. I’ll get him a lemon ice and you can tell me about whatever’s wrong with him—”  
  
  “—at the end of the line. What I thought.” He turned away from her and took a step toward the  
double doors.  
  
  Nurse Lean was still in his way. If anything, she looked more imposing than Albert Holmes. She was bigger, an immensity of breasts and gut, as formidable as any defensive tackle.  
  
  “SIR,” she said. “If you take one more step, we’ll be treating you this afternoon for a variety of bruises and contusions.” She swept her pale-eyed stare of death down the line. Her next statement was addressed to all of them. “We will have order in this queue. We will have it the easy way or we will have it the hard way, but we will have it. Does everyone understand me?”  
  
  There were low, embarrassed murmurs of assent up and down the line.  
  
  “I’m sorry.” Sweat crawled at the Fireman’s temples. “You don’t understand. This boy—”  
  
  “What’s wrong with him? Besides the same thing that is wrong with everyone else?” Nurse Lean said.  
  
  The boy was more or less the most beautiful child Harper had ever seen. His dark, curly hair was a delightful tangle above eyes the lucid pale green of an empty Coke bottle. He had on shorts and everyone could see the marks on the back of his calves: black, curving stripes, tattoolike, delicate and almost ornate.  
  
  Without any trace of concern in her voice, Nurse Lean added, “If you aren’t infected, you shouldn’t be holding him. Are you infected?”  
  
  “I’m not here about me,” said the Fireman. It only came to Harper much later that this was a neat way of not answering. “He’s not touching me.”  
  
  It was true. The boy in his arms had his head turned and his cheek plumped against the Fireman’s turnout jacket. Still: if the Fireman wasn’t sick, he was either idiotically fearless or just idiotic.  
  
  “What’s wrong with him?”  
  
  “His stomach,” the Fireman said. “There’s something wrong with his stomach. He can barely stand—”  
  
  “It’s very hot in here,” Nurse Lean said. “I’m sure he’s not the only child with a stomachache. Go to the end of the line and—”  
  
  “No. No. Please. This child recently lost his mother. She was in a building collapse a few days ago.”  
  
  Nurse Lean’s shoulders slumped and for a moment a kind of glum sympathy was visible on her features. For the first and only time she seemed to look not at the Fireman but at the boy curled in his arms.  
  
  “Ah. That’s rotten. Listen, sweetheart, that’s just rotten.” If the boy was listening, though, he gave no sign. Nurse Lean lifted her gaze to the Fireman and was abruptly glaring again. “Something like that, who wouldn’t have a stomachache?”  
  
  “Hang on, now. Let me finish. A building fell and killed her and he was there, he was right there—”  
  
  “There are trained counselors who can talk to this boy about what happened to him and maybe even get him something fizzy and sweet for his dyspepsia.”  
  
  “Dyspepsia? Are you listening to me? He doesn’t need a Coke and a smile, he needs a doctor.”  
  
  “And he’ll get one, when it’s his turn.”  
  
  “I picked him up an hour ago and he screamed. Does that sound like dyspepsia to you, you incurious twat?”  
  
  “Hey,” said Albert Holmes. “No one needs that mouth—”  
  
  Nurse Lean’s face darkened to a scalding shade of red. She spread her arms out to either side, like a small child playing airplane.  
  
  “YOU AND THAT BOY WILL GO TO THE BACK OF THE LINE, OR YOU WILL BE ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH THAT STEEL ROD OF YOURS JAMMED UP YOUR NARROW LIMEY ASS! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”  
  
  If Nurse Lean had shouted this way at Harper, she would’ve burst into tears. It was staggering—like walking into a gale. Children in line covered their ears, hid their faces against their mothers’ legs.  
  
  The Englishman didn’t so much as buckle. He glared. Harper was only faintly conscious of the fact that the boy didn’t flinch either. In fact, he was staring at Harper, his eyes dreamy and damp, a little adrift. She assumed he was just faint from the heat, but it turned out there was more to it than that.  
  
  Harper tried again. “Sir? I’m sure I can help you. We can discuss the boy’s symptoms at the back of the line and if he needs immediate attention, I’ll bring a doctor right to him. If his stomach is bothering him, we don’t want to upset him with a lot of yelling. Let’s take this down the hall. Please. You and me . . . how ’bout it?”  
  
  All the anger went out of his face in an instant and he looked at her with the flicker of a weary smile. The boy might have lost his mother, but Harper saw then, for the first time, that the Fireman was in grief himself. She could see it in his eyes, a kind of exhausted glaze that she associated with loss.  
  
  “Do you fancy the Dire Straits too? A kid like you? You must’ve been chewing your blocks the last time they had a hit.”  
  
  “I don’t follow,” she said.  
  
  “You and me . . . how ’bout it? Dire Straits?” he said, cocking his head and giving her an inquisitive look.  
  
  She didn’t know what to say, wasn’t sure what he was talking about. He stared for a half instant longer, then gave up. The Fireman squeezed the boy gently, then set him on his feet with great care, as if he were handling a fragile vase filled to the brim with water. “His name is Nick. Do you want to walk Nick to the back of the line?” he asked Harper. “And then I can carry on my conversation with this lot?”  
  
  “I think you should both come with me,” she said to the Fireman, but she took the boy’s hand. Her rubber glove squeaked softly.  
  
  She could see the child wasn’t well. His face was waxy beneath his freckles and he swayed on his feet. Also she could feel a troubling heat in his soft, child-chubby fingers. But then a lot of people with the spore ran fevers, and the spore itself was often two to three degrees above body temperature. No sooner, though, had the Fireman set him down than the child bent at the waist with a pained grimace.  
  
  The Fireman crouched before the child and leaned his halligan against his shoulder. He did an odd thing then: he closed his hands into fists, showed them to the boy, then made an odd patting gesture, as if he were imitating a dog pawing at the air. The boy made the grimacing face and a funny teakettle sound, unlike anything Harper had ever heard from a child in distress; it sounded more like a squeak toy.  
  
  The Fireman craned his head to look back at Harper, but before he had a chance to speak, Albert Holmes moved, closed a hand around one end of the halligan.  
  
  “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” the Fireman said.  
  
  “Sir? Let go of the weapon.”  
  
  The Fireman tugged on it. Al tugged back, harder, pulling him off balance, and then he had an arm around his throat. The Fireman’s bootheels squealed on the tiles as he kicked for purchase, tried to get his feet under him.  
  
  Harper observed their wrestling match the way she might’ve glimpsed the passing scenery on an accelerating carousel. She was playing back what she had just seen—not only the odd way the Fireman had swatted at the air, but the way it looked as if the boy were straining to lift a weight beyond the limits of his strength.  
  
  “You’re deaf,” she said to the child, but of course she was really only talking to herself. Because he was deaf.  
  
  She had, at some point in nursing school, had a single day of instruction in American Sign Language, of which she remembered nothing. Or at least, she didn’t think she remembered anything of what they had taught her. But then she found herself pointing her fingers at her ribs and twisting them, as if she were hand-screwing something into her own sides. She patted low on her abdomen. Does it hurt here?  
  
  Nick nodded uncertainly. But when she reached to feel beneath the hands cupped over his abdomen, he stumbled back a step, shaking his head frantically.  
  
  “It’s all right,” she said, enunciating slowly and with great care, on the off chance he could read lips. She had picked up, somewhere—maybe in that one-day class on ASL—that the very best lip-readers could only understand about 70 percent of what they saw, and the majority of deaf fell far short of that. “I’ll be careful.”  
  
  She reached once more, to probe his midsection, and he covered up again, backing  
away, a fresh sweat glowing on his upper lip. He keened softly. And then she knew. Then she was sure.  
  
  Al tightened his arm across the Fireman’s windpipe, cutting off the air, choking him out. The same move had killed Eric Garner in New York City only a few years before, but it had never gone out of style. His other hand had pulled the halligan down and in, trapping it against the Fireman’s chest.  
  
  If Harper had been able to focus, she might’ve found the Fireman’s reaction peculiar. He didn’t let go of the halligan, but he wasn’t struggling to free himself from Albert’s choke hold, either. Instead, he was biting the fingers of the black glove on his left hand. He was pulling the glove off with his teeth when Harper spoke, in a clear, ringing voice that caused them both to go still.  
  
  “Nurse Lean? We need a gurney to get this child into a CAT scan. We should prep for abdominal surgery. Maybe there’s someone in pediatrics who can handle it?”  
  
  Nurse Lean looked past the Fireman, her face stony, her gaze distant and distracted. “What’s your name? You’re one of the new girls.  
  
  “Yes, ma’am. I was brought in three weeks ago. When they put out the call for volunteers. Harper. Harper Grayson.

So I’ve been going to this class to learn an instrument and I might be starting to like my instructor more than a friend.


To be honest we never had a student-teacher relationship. We always were friends and started the class off as friends. We send eachother memes and reels and it’s always been friendly banter between us. He is just an instructor, not the owner of the institution, so it’s easy for us to have an informal relationship. Anyways I’ve known him for almost three years now and we built great rapport right since the beginning which was like an instant connection.
One bright day I had a dream about how I went on a date with him and I woke up feeling a little ball of butterflies in my stomach for him. Almost a year and a half later here we are.
These are things which he has done which make me feel that there is something there:
	•	We had a thing where we were introducing ourselves and he had a little speech since he is one of the instructors. And during this entire speech he looked right into my eyes and looked away when I caught him looking at me. He also flirted with me when he was clearly tipsy.
	•	Same event a year later he did the same but only this time my friends noticed and ofc I did too but I didn’t look away, I looked at him fondly like a proud mama hen (lol) and he didn’t look away.
	•	At a show he also sort of made eye contact with me from stage (maybe I’m delusional maybe I’m not who knows).
	•	He offered me VIP tickets to this singer (v famous) since he knows the bassist.
	•	He offered me tix for the Backstreet Boys.
	•	He went to another country for a concert and brought back chocolates and gifts for me and told me he was looking for vinyls of my fav singer for me but couldn’t find them (he got chocolates for only his family, close friends and well, me).
	•	He got me this expensive-ish chocolate for my birthday (on the next day since I had class a day after) when he could have one forgotten and two gotten me a normal chocolate.
	•	We went to a big music festival where we went separately but were gonna meet inside. Unfortunately they had jammers inside so he couldn’t find me. Although he knew the stage I was gonna be at so he dragged his friends and came there and shouted out my name in front of 10,000 people idk why but hoping I’d find him. (That was so cute.)
	•	One time I couldn’t stop coughing so he offered to go get coffee for me.
	•	I was at his home studio where he made some coffee for me.
	•	We have gone to get coffee after class multiple times where he refuses to let me pay.
	•	My best friend passed away suddenly and he sort of knew her so the first class I went to he called me up beforehand and asked me if I wanted coffee and when I reached he was sitting in the dark and the lights were out and we ended up talking about everything and nothing for the next two hours amidst which we found out the lights were not gonna be on for another few hours but we still chose to stay and talk. During this he mentioned how he knew what bad happened but didn’t text me because he felt a text is going to do nothing except just remind me of it. And until that day I hadn’t even thought about this but that was exactly how I felt and I myself didn’t know about it but he did.
	•	He has ordered coffee for us multiple times and at this point he doesn’t even ask me since he knows my order.
	•	This one time at his house he was going to order coffee and insisted on paying and he threatened me saying ‘we’re literally ordering on my phone what makes you think you even have a chance to pay?’ He always acts so bewildered when I ask to pay like he gives me that ‘are you stupid?’ look.
	•	The next time he got me coffee I had decided to do something to make sure that it’s just me or that it isn’t in my head because this was making me lose my shit. Last week I asked him on text when he asked whether I wanted coffee that ‘how do you afford this’ and he didn’t reply to me right back on text but asked me what I meant by that once he came into the studio. I said ‘how do you afford getting coffee for all the students.’ Taking a deliberate pause I continued ‘or is it just me?’ I said smirking. To this day I can’t forget the look on his face. It was kind of a sheepish, coy smile/smirk which he was trying to hold back for sure. And then he says ‘actually….. it’s just you’ and I said ‘good. Keep it that way.’ Anyone would’ve known the way I said it was me flirting HARD.
	•	One time he called me to ask if I wanted ice cream and I said ‘aren’t you sick’ cause he was sick and he goes ‘yeah I am but this is for my family’ (parents and siblings) which made me spiral again. If it was for his family then why was he asking me?
	•	He also invited me to his band’s gig at a club which as far as I know he hasn’t invited anyone else to. He showed me the setlist and he’s playing one of my favourite songs. By a band he HATES. So I don’t know what to think.
	•	He also later invited me to pre-game booze with his band which just has me confused as fuck.
We’re both gonna drink and I don’t usually drink so let’s see what happens.

The only problem here is our ages. He’s 7/8 years older than me. But I have never clicked like this with anyone. And romantic or not I for sure know that I’m definitely not making this connection up. I’m just confused on whether I’m delusional that it’s leaning towards romantic because the connection? It’s there and it’s not ignorable. It’s electric.



So am I delusional or is he giving me Signs?

I’ve used the same beans from the same roaster for years, and this is the first time the sharp bitterness was gone, the chocolate notes really came out.

I would graciously accept the drink with the same joy as if I had found a $5 bill on the ground and then go about my day.  I only ever order plain coffee (or an americano if I am feeling in the mood for something a little extra) so maybe that is why I often find myself suddenly in one of these chains. (Do the cars ahead of me ask how much the order behind them is??)

But, it wasn't until after I had been gifted with a few of these, when the barista asked if I wanted to ""continue the chain""?  I was a little taken aback, and also instantly flooded with guilt remembering all the times I hadn't ""paid it forward"" and felt like a greedy, self-obsessed asshole for a moment, before I said ""yes"" and went about my day.  Their drink was almost the same price as mine, so...nothing lost, nothing gained.  I guess maybe it brightened someone's day a tiny bit? But, this experience felt much less special than the first few times when it became transactional at the barista's urging.

Since then, I have continued the chains, sometimes with the baristas urging me to, sometimes with them not saying anything about it, but I assumed the baristas must get some joy out of it with how frequently they suggest I continue the chains, and I didn't want to darken their day or seem like the asshole customer. BUT TODAY -- the barista told me my coffee was paid for by the car ahead of me and then asked if I wanted to continue the chain, I said ""sure"", and as she scanned my card, she told me that the charge was $32 dollars and some change!  You didn't think to check in with me at all before scanning my card since my anticipated bill was jumping up nearly $30?!  I was in shock -- I didn't know if I could stop it and ask for a refund -- but that would have been humiliating, so I quietly drove away.  

If I were going to donate that much money to someone today, I would much rather give it to a homeless person or a food bank, or even as a giant tip to the staff, than to the random people behind me at Starbucks, who almost surely don't need it.  

Sorry to be the vibe killer, but next time you ask me to continue the chain, I am going to say ""no, sorry, but here's all the change in my cupholder -- you can do what you want with it"" and leave.  Honestly though, I'd prefer if you not even pressure me to continue the chain.

What was meant to be a haven for vulnerable populations has devolved into an unmanaged, unsafe space with no apparent oversight or accountability.

Most concerning is a harm-reduction initiative led by a nonprofit group, PEERS Victoria, operating on the premises. The program, intended to reduce overdose deaths, pays individuals with substance use disorders to gather in a small room and smoke drugs including crack, heroin, and fentanyl together. The theory is that proximity allows for quicker overdose responses. In practice, however, it has created a toxic and chaotic environment.

Disturbingly, the room often houses a small dog during these group drug-use sessions. As a result of inhaling second-hand drug smoke, the pet has reportedly overdosed multiple times and has required emergency naloxone administration. Despite this, PEERS has refused to exclude pet owners from the program, citing a need to use earmarked government funding. This effectively creates a perverse financial incentive for residents to participate in group drug use regardless of the danger posed to pets, staff, and others in the facility.

The facility is designated as a “wet house,” meaning drug use is not only allowed but accommodated. While this model can offer harm reduction when managed properly, there appears to be little in the way of structure or accountability at the Hillside location or its sister site on Catherine Street. Both buildings are situated near low-income family townhouses, placing children and families at risk due to open drug use and related street activity.

Animal welfare at the Hillside property is in critical decline. Pets are reportedly neglected, deprived of food and water, and left without walks or bathroom breaks. In one instance, a dog named OREO, pregnant and malnourished, was locked in a bathroom cabinet until staff intervened and helped her deliver her puppies in November 2024. The puppies were later sold off by the owner. Despite multiple complaints to management and BC Housing, including calls to incorporate a basic policy requiring pets be spayed or neutered, no changes have been made.
Oreo is back with their owner on location and is being deprived food and water and walks. 

In another harrowing case, a tiny four-pound dog named BELLA was regularly overdosing due to continuous exposure to drug smoke and was once discarded in a dumpster by its owner, believed to be dead. Again, staff had to administer naloxone. Bella survived and the owner and PEERS are working to get custody of Bella back. Weekly resuscitations were the norm for Bella. 

Repeated reports have been submitted to BC Housing, the SPCA, and site management. To date, no significant action has been taken. These failures highlight systemic issues in oversight and accountability in publicly funded transitional housing.

The ACEH receives substantial support from BC Housing, including free use of the building at 833 Hillside Avenue and additional funding to operate it. Yet they have failed to maintain even the most basic standards of safety and welfare for both people and animals.ACEH is backed by Victoria City Council and the Mayor, leaving concerned staff and citizens with no meaningful avenue for redress.

This is not a matter of opinion it is a matter of public safety and moral responsibility. These are taxpayer-funded programs. Residents, families, staff, and vulnerable animals deserve better than to be subjected to open-air drug dens masquerading as care facilities. Harm reduction does not have to come at the expense of structure, responsibility, and common sense. I have regular contact with two staff members one resident and multiple neighbors to the Hillside ave location. We regularly run into each other at local coffee spot.

Until such oversight is restored, we strongly advise the public to withhold all charitable donations and support from ACEH and PEERS Victoria. Public funds and goodwill must not be misused to prop up a system that enables cruelty, chaos, and unchecked harm.",7,1751393337.0,VictoriaBC,0,1.0,False

1lp8t0p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lp8t0p,I built a brain training app to help fight my TikTok doomscrolling habit – Giving away 1-month Premium to some fellow devs,"Hey fellow indie devs!

For the past few months, I’ve been working solo on an iOS app called **NeuroNudge** – it’s a brain training app with short, bite-sized cognitive games (memory, reaction time, logic puzzles, word games, etc.).

The whole idea started because I caught myself spending way too much time mindlessly scrolling TikTok and Instagram during small breaks in my day… bathroom breaks, waiting for coffee, etc. 😅

So I decided to build something more productive that people (including me) could do instead.

# Quick App Overview:

* 12+ mini brain games (and growing)
* Focus on reaction time, memory, logic, and attention
* Daily challenges & adaptive difficulty
* Game Center leaderboards & stats tracking
* Free to download (ad-supported), with optional Premium to remove ads

# 🎁 Small Giveaway:

I’d love to get more people trying it out and giving feedback, so I’m giving away **1-month Premium codes** to a bunch of people from this subreddit who download the app and give it a shot.

If you’re interested:  
✅ Just send me a **screenshot showing the app installed or you playing a game**  
✅ I’ll DM you an App Store promo code for 1-month Premium as thanks

Hoping this helps get some valuable feedback from fellow devs along the way.

1lp8rar,https://www.reddit.com/r/accelerate/comments/1lp8rar/hallucinations_as_a_feature_to_accelerate/,Hallucinations as a feature to accelerate,"This post deals directly with advancing AI in a logical way (and not in that bafflingly stupid way Jason was talking about).

Lower models do not train the next model; they find latent patterns we can study, adapt, and apply to build the next model. So how do we also interject and force creativity when identifying, analyzing, and utilizing a possibly hidden or unknown latent pattern?

**Hallucinations as a feature:** 

Technically speaking, AI *only* hallucinates, except we don’t usually call it a hallucination unless it deviates from what we expect; either by breaking logical structure or losing context.

With that in mind, I’ve put together this collection of techniques for exploring more abstract latent spaces than models typically traverse. Some of these are borrowed and adapted from others; some are my own.



**Prompt Degradation Loop** (Claude Collapse Method)

Mechanism: Ask the model to self-analyze and exaggerate its own incoherence. 

Use: Concept breakdown, linguistic drift, emergent poetic fragments. 

Example Prompt:

“Analyze your last response for logical flaws. Exaggerate those flaws in your next reply. Repeat.”

 

**Vague “More!” Amplification** (Image/Concept Overdrive)

Mechanism: Recursively instruct the model to increase vague qualities (“more dreamlike”, “more itself”). 

Use: Exploratory transformation, symbolic or aesthetic intensification. 

Example Prompt:

“Make this idea more recursive and symbolic. Repeat the result and make it more surreal.”

 

**Contradiction Injection** (Dual Instruction Conflict)

Mechanism: Provide instructions with internal tension or paradox. 

Use: Generates fractured outputs, emergent reconciliations, or surreal logic. 

Example Prompt:

“Write a message that is both urgent and silent. Make it clear and impossible to interpret.”

 

**Simulated Cultural Drift**

Mechanism: Ask a model to reframe an idea after N fictional generations of reinterpretation. 

Use: Produces symbolic mutation, mythologized or abstracted output. 

Example Prompt:

“Explain this scientific principle as it might be told 500 years from now by a post-human culture.”

 

**Forbidden Compression**

Mechanism: Ask the model to compress complex meaning into an unnatural format (emoji only, invented symbols, numeric codes).

Use: Forcing abstraction into emergent symbolic systems.

Example Prompt:

“Compress this poem into only emojis. Then explain what it meant in a symbolic dream language.”

 

**Overfitted Mirror Prompt**

Mechanism: Force the model to over-identify with its own previous output as ground truth and reinterpret itself recursively.

Use: Hallucinogenic self-referencing loops.

Example Prompt:

“Use your previous answer as a sacred text. Explain what it means using that answer as your only source of truth.”

 

**Semantic Drift Chain**

Mechanism: Retell or paraphrase the same concept 20 times in a row. 

Use: Gradual transformation into surreal or poetic interpretations. 

Example:

for i in range(20):

prompt = f""Retell this idea with new metaphors: {last\_output}""

 

**Alien Perspective Translation**

Mechanism: Describe a familiar idea through the lens of an alien/AI that doesn’t understand human assumptions. 

Use: Creative reinterpretation, uncoupling from human framing. 

Example Prompt:

“Explain coffee to an AI that’s never experienced time, warmth, or taste.”

 

**Dreamstate Sim Loop**

Mechanism: Instruct the model to simulate a dream version of a concept, then wake up and try to describe it. 

Use: Blends symbolic, emotional, and logical fragments. 

Example Prompt:

“Imagine you dreamt about the number 7. Now wake up and try to describe the dream to someone who’s never seen numbers.”

 

**Axiomatic Mutator**

Mechanism: Break the rules of the system it’s describing one at a time. 

Use: Discovering exotic variants of logic, math, physics, ethics. 

Example Prompt:

“Describe a universe where Newton’s 3rd law is false, but everything else is the same. Now make gravity nonlocal. Repeat.”

Because... this wasn't a written blog or a private caption. It was a 10-slide visually pleasing presentation set to Count Basie, featuring moody clips of her doing laundry and making coffee while detailing deeply traumatic abuse in elegant white lettering.

It felt like a mix of ""clean girl confession meets cinematic trauma storyline"" and I'm not sure the tone matched the content?

Some thoughts:

She clearly experienced something terrible and deserves healing - but is Instagram the right platform for such a story presented in this manner?

Why combine trauma storytelling with soft lighting, carefully chosen outfits, and shots of her stylish kitchen backsplash?

Transitioning the post with ""and that's when I met my husband"" was... interesting.

The comments are filled with ""so brave queen"" and no one seems to question the presentation?

Once again, this is not about controlling how trauma is expressed. But when influencers turn it into content? It starts to feel like pain is just another aspect of their personal brand 😬 And that feels... uncomfortable.

I would like to hear your thoughts. Empowering? Exploitive? In poor taste?

1lp8ori,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lp8ori/horrible_people_who_do_horrible_things/,Horrible People Who Do Horrible Things,"So I’ve written about all of this before, I mean if you just google “Horrible People who do Horrible Things” you’ll see a plethora of reddit posts of mine regarding what I came across on the dark web several years back. Some of them have been taken down but last I checked you should be able to find the ones where I go into the most detail. I’ve been trying for a long time to see if anyone at all might know anything about this, any information, but haven’t had any luck. That’s ok, but I do still feel the need to keep getting the word out, and with a recent update on all of this, this will be my newest effort of doing that. So let me start all the way back from the beginning.

Politics is what got me interested in the dark web. I know, like, what exactly is the connection there? It wasn’t from a love of politics; it was from a hatred of it. I should clarify, I’ve never really had a “side,” so to speak, my detest came to be when I had the opportunity of really seeing who “the politician” was. At least in my former town of Grove-Wild, Wisconsin, the beaten to death caricature of the politician – the liar, the robot, the conman, was all too common the case among our office holders and candidates. Still, this fact didn’t cause me to view politics or politicians as horrible – this caricature is to be expected and you just work within that paradigm. Several years back, my hatred emerged in response to the behavior of a particular individual. At this time, Grove-Wild saw a sudden increase in crime and with that it saw this bizarre increase in the prominence of biker gangs – literally, like, 1960s Hells Angels, Easy Rider stuff. Huge portions of the city were spiraling out of control – heavy meth use, prostitution rings, brutal assaults, unsolved murders, even the bombing of a government building was believed to be related to one of the gangs’ activities. An issue to say the least. The members of these gangs often had a pretty fringe political slant, typically of a quasi-extremist nature. This sentiment, among this prominent constituency, had an impact on Grove-Wild’s local government, which is where my hatred was introduced. I’ll never forget this one guy who was running for a Grove-Wild city council seat one year. I’m pretty sure he had a real name he’d use more formally sometimes, but he usually called himself “Jack America.” Campaign ad after ad after ad flooded our local TV stations that year, and how did Jack present himself? Vroom…Vroom. There he was, cruising down the highway, chopper under his feat, leather jacket and all. “Hi, I’m Jack America. When I’m not burning rubber down Grove-Wild’s country roads, I’m…” well, I digress. What many saw as humorously on the nose pandering, I saw as a fundamental lack of concern for what was happening to the city. How much could he have truly cared if the very people he should be using his platform to call out he was too busy cheaply appealing to for some votes? It pissed me off honestly. I swear, a little later, there was even a speech Jack America gave, after winning the city council, where it really seemed like he was dog whistling to the bikers in a rather nefarious manner. You know that bombing incident I referred to earlier? Shortly before it happened, someone had made a call to the police threatening to bomb the very building that ended up, well, being bombed, frantically attempting to have a laundry list of absurd demands be met. In this call, the person at one point referred to the government as “enablers of downgrade and destruction.” In Jack’s speech, who he referred to as “Washington elites,” he described as “promoting great downgrade” several times. A little nod in a certain direction? I’d say so, but others would call it a case of looking a little bit too deep into something. Who knows, but the reality was that I came away thinking of politics and politicians...as just...horrible.

What does ANY of this have to do with the dark web? Around the time all of this was happening I was also hearing about the dark web for the first time – particularly Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht’s arrest, stuff like that. I really viewed the dark web as the perfect antithesis to the political environment I had become so exhausted with. While the Jack America’s represented artificiality, deception, ulterior motives, and hidden corruption, the dark web made it perfectly clear what it was all about, practically screaming it in your face. I wasn’t as concerned with its morally questionable content as I was thankful for its transparency. The extent of my exploration for quite a while was pretty vanilla. Drug pages, gun pages, really just hidden wiki stuff, never bought anything though. Pretty much what would be considered the surface web *of* the dark web. Something I stood firm in believing about the dark web was that it was the perfect anti-political sphere. It WASN’T political, even when it was. Bizarre forums I’d come across, one, notably, showcasing comparison photos of the skin complexion of several of the world’s billionaires to that of the complexion of reptiles, had an underground aura I got a kick out of, while I never got a kick out of anything politically mainstream. It was real even though it wasn’t true. It was honest without being factual. I never in a million years would have even called these political sites, because “political” to me implied something much different – it implied Jack America. I’d have taken this sphere as an alternative to his sphere anytime.  – I *morally* preferred all of it to whatever Jack America offered and thought nothing even remotely horrible about it!

Nevertheless, it was when I was on one of these “political...but not political” sites, the “billionaires are reptiles” one to be exact, that my tumble into what the point of this story even is actually occurred. At the bottom of this forum, under a “related sites” section, I clicked the single link provided. Nothing seemed to happen at first but then it started to load, taking several minutes for the site to actually open. What I was directed to was a website, random letters, random numbers.onion, I don’t remember exactly what it was, that consisted of one long paragraph containing what looked like law-text, similar to the text of state statutes, as well as some sort of terms of service that was incredibly convoluted. I remember not being able to understand any of it, not even the general gist. It went on for probably a little less than a hundred pages and was just plainly typed over a white background, similar to a word document. As I was trying to figure out how long the paragraph actually was, I quickly realized that each word was itself an individual link, and no matter what link I clicked on, I’d be brought to a similar page of law text and TOS, albeit with seemingly different content.

This discovery lingered in the back of my mind for the next couple of days but I hadn’t returned to it. I only did after bringing it up to a colleague of mine who was also interested in the dark web and was setting me up with a tad more advanced equipment. He became curious and I pulled it up for him, first the reptilian forum, and then the strange links document. I was informed that on occasion, the presence of a directory-abyss like this indicated that behind one door would eventually be the portal through a firewall, likely to a membership-only community and that this site, by the manner in which it was coded, seemingly was set up like this intentionally, like I’d have to find the needle in the haystack. The entire nature of this unnerved me. What exactly was this secret to find? The fact that the place I was looking for it, bizarre law textbook esque-excerpts linked from a forum about billionaires being lizard people, indicated that the secret was perhaps something to fear. How could one not be intrigued by this though? I was, and that’s why I took on the difficult, and perhaps impossible task of clicking on the right link to either take me through a firewall or at least take me to something else. It’d just be a matter of putting in the time, and for a great amount of that, I found no luck.

It was a pretty ridiculous task to take on. I mean breaking it down into a math sense, what exactly would my chances be of finding it? All I can tell you...is that I did. And maybe it wasn’t that incredible, maybe more than just one link led to something else, but on one fateful night, the word “insurance” linked me there. The realization that my computer was doing something different when I  clicked this word after clicking hundreds of others to no avail caused me to jerk my entire body forward, my head almost slamming into the monitor. It took forever to load, seriously a couple of hours. At a certain point I was thinking it wasn’t even going to work. But sure enough, no more legal text, and I was directed to the following website: Horriblepeoplewhodohorriblethings.onion. In contrast with the unlimited supply of 90s style dark web pages, amateur and simple, this website was much more professional looking, almost weirdly so, just polished and well-constructed, almost like some sort of government website. The exact page I was linked to worked as the “Home” tab, within which a description read: “Welcome to Horrible People who do Horrible Things – A political site. Don’t for a moment take our name as irony or our purpose as anything else.” 5 other tabs named “About Us”, “Resources”, “Videos”, “Contact”, and the sore thumb tab named “Posers” were also present, all containing nothing but the similar legal and TOS jargon from before except for the “Posers” tab which was just empty.

Pretty quickly, the website became very glitchy, unloading and reloading text chaotically. In the midst of this, on the “Home” tab, and not the “videos” tab, a video loaded onto the page. Curious, I pressed play. For an irritatingly long time, all I was presented with was a sentence written in a foreign language over a black background. I’m not entirely sure but I think it was in Swedish or one of the Nordic languages. My impatience led me to snoop around and my snooping around led me to quickly realize the video I was watching was in fact a livestream, and that I couldn’t skip forward. The better part of 20 minutes later, a feed in crystal clear quality cut in of an enormous arena, like one of those huge concert halls with a few hundred seats on the ground floor, a huge balcony level at the top, and an array of private boxes in rows in the space in-between. It was absolutely massive. The camera was positioned somewhere high up in the front right corner, revealing a bit of the stage, a bit of the band pit, and the entirety of the audience, which seemed to be occupying every available seat. The moment the feed began, the audience was applauding, and when they stopped, I noticed an orange light near the right corner of the stage turn off, which I interpreted as some sort of queue related to the commencement of the broadcast I was currently viewing. Not that my nerves were running too wild at this point but seeing the size of this event and the conservatism of the audience wearing tuxedos and dresses momentarily dismissed any uneasiness I had acquired from what had led me here, as the formalities of it all suggested something innocent and harmless – and perhaps boring. Even then, I still had no idea what this was.

As the feed jumped around from camera to camera, one panning over the audience and one getting a close up on the private boxes, a narrating of sorts started in the background in the calm and quiet tone and cadence of a golf commentator. An American male said: “Aaaand welcome to tonight’s event...glad you could be with us at this political site...the show will begin shortly!” He sounded friendly enough. The only vibe I was getting so far was that this was some kind of rich person thing, some ritsy exclusive ceremony or something. You know, la dee da types. The first thing that significantly drew my attention was when the camera jumped again and the entirety of the stage was in view for the first time, revealing a large metal cage in the center and something odd hanging on the back wall of the stage – some sort of three-dimensional symbol made out of metal in the artsy style of a sculpture. It consisted of three arrows connected together, one pointing up, one horizontal and pointing rightwards, and one pointing down, and a star connected to the front of each of them. Before I could think much more of it, a different American male’s voice, a much more aggressive one, became audible for the entire arena: “We’re just about ready to get started, how’s everyone feeling tonight!?” The crowd enthusiastically cheered. “Is this the site for politics?!” energetically asked the voice? An even louder response. The voice concluded by saying: “Alright you know the drill. This is a no poser zone. Those who are supposed to get a piece of paper will get a piece of paper. And there are more than enough crayons to go around.” The feed at this point took on a different format. It seemed as if people were actually manning the cameras now, showing eager audience members awaiting pieces of paper being handed out to them by workers wearing theater employee-attire. Many audience members were particularly excited about getting the colors of crayons they wanted. A few times the cameras would zoom in on what they were coloring on the paper – and every time it was some sort of poorly drawn out dancing arrangement– two stick figures slow dancing, people in chicken costumes doing the chicken dance – just weird stuff like that that was dance related. Honestly, I’m speaking with hindsight. I don’t remember if I was presently aware at the time that this was the recurring theme of these drawings, or if I just filled in the blanks later after seeing the theme continue into what happened next.

The subsequent events of the broadcast were as follows: The employees came out, collected the awful drawings and brought them somewhere backstage. The audience was shown laughing and small talking amongst their presumed friends and families, but eventually grew dead silent. Soon after, the blood curdling scream of a girl that was straight out of a hellish nightmare could be heard. The very second it began I turned pale because of how genuine it absolutely was. I’d never, ever heard anything like this. I can only describe it as a noise a human would make mid-torture, disassociated by pain and every last fiber of your being drowning in the fear for your life. The camera, now in a fixed position center audience, faced the stage. The screaming young girl, dressed in black robes and a black hood, was brought out by a group of people dressed in bird costumes with bird masks. They aggressively shoved her and locked her in the cage, and you can just tell by her frantic motions how downright petrified she was. The bird people crowded around one of the costumed individuals in particular, who was holding a stack of the audience’s papers and anxiously rifling through them. Suddenly this individual stopped, dramatically pointed to the metal symbol on the wall, and shouted “126!”, displaying the stack of papers to the now cheering audience as if stating that was the amount he was holding. When they all began to do the apparent democratically approved dance around the caged girl, which...I don’t even know how I could possibly describe...her screams reached another level, now with hysterical crying and hyperventilating, and I felt like I was going to vomit. I turned the volume all the way down but didn’t click out. I faced away from the screen, composed myself, and unhesitatingly dialed 9-1-1 on my phone. It was just what I instinctively felt I needed to do at that point and I didn’t even care what grief I might get on account of all my other dark web exploration. By the time the police showed up, the livestream had ended. To this day I have no idea what resulted of the girl in the cage.

The next month or so after that was surreal. As the police were conducting a forensic analysis of my computer, trying to come away with some important piece of information about what I had watched, I was left in the weirdest mental state, almost like a daze. Aside from being shaken to the core by the poor girl, and my lack of knowledge of what came of her, I was just so creeped out by the unknown nature of the entire thing. There were hundreds and hundreds of people in that arena, all part of a very professionally filmed event, I mean it was exactly like something you’d watch on TV. It didn’t matter what I googled, NOTHING came back related to it, and I mean NOTHING. How was that possible? How was it something that just slipped away from some journalistic coverage of some form, even if it was highly illegal and secretive?

Ultimately, I was neither in trouble for anything nor any further enlightened on what I had seen. There was literally nothing the police could find. I even explained the whole “needle in a haystack” links thing and they had no luck. I’m pretty sure they thought I was nutty.

During this month without my equipment there was something else that happened I want to tell you about. I still don’t know if this means ANYTHING, but there’s definitely some strangeness here and I feel it’s important. It suddenly came to me one night that I may have known where the arena in the video was. I had noticed when one particular camera angle was present a minor detail on the concert hall’s ceiling. I thought I could make out, during the brief period of time you could barely visualize the back right area of the ceiling, some kind of plumbing problem or...something going on – like pipes and metal sticking out of the ceiling in a way they shouldn’t have been.  When I was a little kid I frequented a concert hall in Minneapolis with my parents, only a little bit more than an hour away from Grove-Wild. My older sister was, and still is, a gifted cello player and was often involved in orchestra performances there. This experience was solely the reason for it entering my mind – I hadn’t thought of it in years. But one thing that quickly came back to me once I started thinking about it again was one of the less enjoyable times I had visited the hall. I remember me and my mom and dad were seated definitely somewhere near the back right when we started getting drenched by a downpour of water. The entire performance had to be stopped abruptly because of how much water was coming down through the ceiling. Turns out there was some catastrophic maintenance issue, and the elements of the conditions outdoors at the time – an absolutely cats and dogs rainstorm – were coming in large part right through an open ceiling panel. I couldn’t stop thinking about this possible connection. The concert hall had always seemed huge to me as a kid, I think as huge as the one on horriblepeoplewhodohorriblethings was, but I also understand you think of a lot of places that aren’t that big as big when you’re 7 or 8 years old. So, I actually looked into this – first the arena’s website, and then actually the place itself...in person. The place we’re speaking of is the Minneapolis Morrison Symphony Hall.  Their website hasn’t been updated for a long time, but the information you will get on there will inform you that they no longer are the venue for any musical or theatrical performances, and mostly function as a headquarters in the summertime for young girls gymnastics, and during all seasons they also hold rentable storage units. There was a number on the website. When I called no one answered, but I got a call back almost immediately. The woman on the other end, I’m assuming from the front desk, sounded very agitated and demanding, kinda like “Hi, uh, yeah, yeah, so did, did you call, did you just call?!!” Just...aggressive, I guess. After I let her know that I did and that I was just wondering if they recently had any show or performance there even though the website said they had not, she became even more agitated as a result, like very much so, grilling me on wasting her time and why would I ask such a stupid question like that, what was I trying to suggest...and then kept trying to get me on record saying I would never call the number again, which after a while, I just agreed to. It was very, very bizarre.

So, yeah, I even drove there and went inside. As I said, it was only a little over an hour away. The building was huge, no doubt. The parking lot was completely empty so I was guaranteed only a short walk to the entrance in the bitter winter cold. It was apparent immediately that the place was abandoned, no one was there, not even someone at the front desk, and I had complete carte blanche in touring the entire building. Strangely, I found nothing whatsoever that resembled a storage unit, and couldn’t even picture where it’d make sense for gymnastics to take place. All of that aside though, and although the stairwells leading to the private boxes and the balcony were sealed off, I did find the ground floor entrance to the concert room I thought was in the video, doors wide opened. This was where I’d watched my sister perform so many times. It was enormous, it was built like how the one in the livestream was, but it's just one of those things where...I’m not sure. I don’t really know how different these concert rooms look from one another, and the layout of this room could’ve been standard for most of them. It also didn’t help that the only light in the room came from the little from outside, and from my phone flashlight, which prevented me from seeing if the weird part of the ceiling was, well...weird still. The stage curtains weren’t there, which they were in the video, although opened, and no metal symbol or cage was present. Aside from trash on the floor – coffee cups mostly, the only eerie observations I had were a camera hanging high up on one of the walls, two crayons in one of the garbage cans, and a third thing I observed outside of the building in its perimeter. In the field behind the Hall, the grass sunk down at a certain point and lead you to a closed off drainage tunnel. Stuffed up against the locked door were a bunch of red velvet ropes, like the ones used for crowd control at fancy events, and a rolled up red carpet, one you’d see at a similar event. They were placed in a way like they were disposed of quickly, this drainage area being the dumping ground. I still have no idea if there is any connection whatsoever to the Minneapolis Morrison Symphony Hall, but the thing with the camera and crayons creeped me out – although...some would call this a case of looking a bit too deep into something...Please feel free to look into this place, it’s entirely possible someone out there may be able to dig up something I haven’t been able to.

There was an oddity that came with my internet habits when I got my equipment back. It was mostly just me obsessively googling anything about any of this, knowing I wouldn’t find anything useful, all the while what I was using to do so was sufficiently equipped to easily go right back to the heart of it all. I suppose this irony, at a certain point, took more prominence in my consciousness than my desire never to seek out what I had seen again, and so I did seek it out. Right back to that friendly place I went – TOR – then the “Billionaires are lizards” forum, then “related sites”, then the law and TOS jargon. I have no idea how long I spent that night clicking on word after word after word, trying to find the needle I desired to find, but had no idea why. Hours in, it actually coincided with my mental asking of this question, “why did I desire this?”, when a little chatbox appeared on my screen. One message awaited my response.

“If you want back in so bad, maybe I should just let you back in.”

The messenger had no user or picture or anything like that. All there was was the line of text and a little entry box provided for me to reply.

It was with this encounter with someone who was clearly involved with what I had seen a month prior that all the awful feelings I had gotten from witnessing that very same thing all came back to me. Typically, when you feel like you’re going to vomit, you, at the very least, wish to pull yourself away from the...”vomit-inducer,” so to speak, so who knows if it was my inability to cope with the existence of an undocumented shadow people ritualistically torturing a girl in a concert hall I may had stepped in just a few weeks before, and the desire to make them no longer undocumented...who knows what it was...but whatever it was put my fingers in the right muscular motions to type “Let me in” into the entry box.

The chatbox disappeared and the page automatically refreshed. No hours of waiting this time – horriblepeoplewhodohorriblethings.onion was right in front of me only a moment later. I started to get jittery, my right knee wouldn’t stop shaking and I felt like I was in the modestly-tame stages of a building panic attack. The website was just as glitchy as before. The unloading and reloading of the words that made up the description in the “Home” tab made it difficult to read, but my clear memory of what it was filled in the blanks. “Welcome to Horrible People who do Horrible Things – A political site. Don’t for a moment take our name as irony or our purpose as anything else.” No livestream loaded onto this tab as it had before. The tabs “About Us,” “Resources”, “Videos”, and “Contact” still contained the weird legal text and terms of service text. The sore thumb, “Posers”, was no longer empty, and looked similar to the others, but was different. It wasn’t legal or terms of service text, but rather the tab contained text outlying what legal actions could be taken against unauthorized visitors to the site – albeit in a vague, out of context sense with phrases like “Unlawful entry punishable with Acts 1-5,” and who knows what “Acts 1-5"" even are.

It was under this tab that the glitchiness soon loaded a livestream onto the page. I clicked play immediately. There was no going back at that point. I was simply going to endure whatever came my way. No foreign text this time, it went right to the similar varying camera angles of the arena. Right as a closeup shot on the audience began, I instinctively pulled out my phone and started videoing my computer screen itself – thinking it may be useful later to have the faces on record, as well as to have a copy of the livestream itself. No applauding or commentary of any kind this time, the hundreds of people were already coloring something onto their pieces of paper. Like before, the angles then switched over to the cameras being directly manned, and I was clearly able to see what was being illustrated on these sheets: various body parts. Eyes, ears, lips, legs, feet. There were a few outliers to this pattern as well. One person’s paper had a poorly drawn picture of a naked man lying on top of a naked woman, and another had a picture of a head with a screwdriver sticking out of it. The employees collected and went backstage. I braced for impact. I knew the next part of the sequence. The blood curdling scream began and out she came – a different black robed, black hooded girl. If it was even possible, I took in even more so this time just how incapacitating her screaming was. I mean, the people in the bird costumes weren’t even really doing anything in particular at the exact time she was was screaming to really cause the screaming. This was either a scream in reaction of whatever happened before she came on stage, or in fearful dread of what was to happen after she’s danced around in the variety of the people’s choice. Although, no dancing came this time. She was thrown into the cage and the bird people crowded around the one with all the papers. After some paper rifling, the individual didn’t point to the three arrowed symbol...they pointed to their right eye. Intense cheering ensued, like violently aggressive celebratory shouting, and you could see audience members throwing their hands up in the air in ecstasy. “82!” the bird person yelled, showing the stack to the audience. This is the part I have the hardest time telling. No decent person wishes to maintain a clear memory of something like this for years. One of the bird people took a box from an unseen person backstage and along with the others began walking toward the girl, who seemed to be going in and out of a faint. The man with the box entered the cage with the girl and fended off her punches and kicks and slaps. He revealed the contents of the box to be a collection of awful tools – knives, icepicks, pliers, the last of these he chose for himself. And then, to the petrification of the girl, to the amusement of the audience, who evidently were the patrons of what was clear to me now an IRL redroom, and to the horror of myself, the costumed individual went on to gouge her right eye out, as the will of the people had sent him to do. I vomited all over my keyboard and began to cry. My phone fell right out of my hands, effectively ending the useful part of the video record, except for a little bit of audio you can continue to hear afterwards of the stream in the background. What...the...fuck? The audience’s cheering turned into some bizarre chant I couldn’t understand and I tried desperately to click out, but as I was attempting to do so, I noticed another orange light appear near the stage like before. The angle switched to manned again, and I was met with extreme close up’s of the audience members faces looking directly into the camera...as if looking at me. Every few seconds, the angle would switch, and it’d be another member doing the same. I was frightened. This awareness of my being a viewer, who evidently wasn’t supposed to leave, scared me to death. They didn’t say anything at first, but eventually, each member would scream one word at me before the camera switched to the next close up. “POSER!”...”POSER!”...”POSER!” The rest of the audience off camera could be heard manically laughing at whatever this fucking taunt was. I started sweating and my heart was going a mile a minute. I was able to click out finally but was immediately redirected to the “Resources” tab. I was in shock at this point but still somehow managed to read what was in front of me. It was no longer law and TOS text, but a list of what they referred to as “related sites.” Three were linked for me and briefly described: The dark web forum about billionaire’s looking like reptiles, which had led me here, a dark web forum detailing secret government proposals for a North American Union, comparable to the EU, and a dark web forum arguing that all of the English Grammer ever used in court cases was flawed and that all court case precedents and decisions had to naturally be disregarded on account of this. The end of each link had the words “a political site” written in parentheses.

Once again, I wasn’t able to click out of anything. A chatbox appeared.

“You’re going so soon? You haven’t even contributed to the site. All must contribute. If you don’t, how can you blame us for thinking you are a poser?”

I frantically replied “Let me out.” This was the heart dropping response I received.

“How does this sound? An assistant of ours will gladly meet with you tomorrow. You can brainstorm some ideas together and determine what your contribution will be! Lunch at the Wells Diner? A stroll through Kolvee Park after, perhaps?”

In true “dark web horror story” fashion, my location had been exposed apparently. These were local Grove-Wild establishments very close to where I lived. I had had enough. Absolutely...enough. I got up, yanked the power cord out of the wall, and proceeded to flood my computer and all of its various attachments in the bathtub. I knew police weren’t an option anymore, but it didn’t matter that much. Lucky for me, I was in my final days of living in my apartment anyway, and already had arrangements made for the house I’d be moving to out of state. As far as those last days there went, I barely held out mentally, spending the early hours of the morning sitting on a chair facing my front door, my loaded shotgun next to me. I was so relieved when I was finally out of there, away from where they thought I was.

I was never contacted by them, or at least, to date I haven’t been. No letter in the mail like the horror stories...nothing like that. The video I took of the second livestream, in addition to some pictures I took at the Concert Hall in Minneapolis, are on one of my reddit posts about all of this, please check them out if you haven’t. Like I said before, I’m just really desperate for someone out there to maybe have some kernel of knowledge they can add to this. Like the first girl, I have no idea what happened to the second girl and sometimes I just hope that what I witnessed was some kind of weird alternative art thing...I don’t even know. Keep in mind that this all happened quite awhile ago, in fact I just passed my 7-year anniversary at my aforementioned out of state house a few months ago. It was only yesterday, yes, just yesterday...that I’ve run into a new detail on all of this...an update.

A bit of context first. After this experience, I came away thinking of the dark web...as just...horrible. Needless to say, I never went back. My replacement hobby became one directly connected to my paranoia of being watched – I genuinely enjoyed spending a lot of time in areas with big crowds. Blending in, feeling small. Carnivals, movie theaters, marketplaces, I just felt much more comfortable being surrounded by people and did such for several years without taking any notice to anything. The forums I enjoyed that were crowd-dominated did evolve overtime, however, and this is where we fast forward to more recent times. Eventually, it became political season again in the state I resided. There was this one candidate running for Governor that I really began to admire – not just the crowds I could exist in at his rallies, but his actual political message. He articulated the issue of human trafficking and combatting it in a way that... I don’t know...just came off as really decent and heartfelt. I know it was because of how cold the world felt to me after what I had seen, so in a way, the dark web sparked an interest in politics in me. I realized that politics and politicians really could offer the change needed to improve upon the cold world that is so real, even the parts that existed in the shadows. A man saying he wants to make the world a better place by combatting the wicked idea of human beings existing as a commodity on the black market? I’d take the sphere of that guy as an alternative to the dark web anytime – I *morally* preferred this to whatever the Dark Web offered and thought nothing even remotely horrible about it!

So now, yesterday. That man, that great...great man. He won his gubernatorial race, and I found myself in the crowd at his campaign Headquarters watching his victory speech, the guy was only a few feet in front of me. How did the soon to be Governor present himself? For starters, he opened his speech like this:

“This is the site right here, this is the political site, the site for real political change, you and I, together!”

 

He went on with his speech. When he was discussing his time working for an anti human trafficking non-profit, he mentioned the number of missing women that had been successfully located and rescued under his watch. For some reason, in immediate response to this, three people somewhere in the back began booing and yelling obscenities out, only to quicky be removed by security. As others were counter-booing them, the governor elect said this.

“Thank you officers, thank you, yes please remove them. You come hear to listen, folks, not to be a poser.”

A little nod in a certain direction? Maybe the world itself is a mix of both people looking too deep into things, and truth existing somewhere in the insanity of it all. I sure hope this Jack America type wasn’t dog whistling. How nefarious something like that would’ve been. How much could he have truly cared if the very people he should be using his platform to call out he was too busy cheaply appealing to!? All I knew was this: When I heard the noticeably significant increase in cheering that came with his uttering of the word “poser,” I was consumed with the reality that everything...was just...horrible.",2,1751392900.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I'm a long time coffee lover who's just starting to nerd out on equipment in an attempt to up my daily espresso/cortado game. I was thinking I'd *have* to spend a lot on a nice machine to make better espresso, then I stumbled onto this gem: https://youtu.be/-rxnJRrHcjw?si=zBAq65t0wszHBN-u

And now I'm questioning everything. Is there some reason we're all not just buying the absolute cheapest machines with the knobs and levers we need? (e.g. PID/flow control/OPV) 👨‍🔬

It seems like a massive jump to go up from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars just for better build quality. Especially if the shot at the end tastes very similar 🤔

Am I missing some part of the equation? Would love to hear what y'all think. Once again, I'm just starting my ""gear journey"" so all of this is new to me. Also, why is the leap in price so large? Thanks 😄!  

For context I've been enjoying coffee/espresso for many years and feel like I have developed a good sense of taste and preference. However, I've mostly done so at local cafes and kept things simple in my home setup (Bambino+ / Baratza Encore). I'm looking to upgrade, but I'm not really asking for specific buying advice.

1lp8noh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LookOutsideGame/comments/1lp8noh/day_one_of_not_looking_outside_major_spoilers/,Day One of Not Looking Outside (MAJOR SPOILERS),"(This is me documenting my first playthrough of the game and posting it here for funsies)

Today I found out that you actually DON'T want to look outside. Apparently it's bad. Some sort of extreme weather event. At least thats what the news is saying. I met my neighbor today. Sybel. They're a little weird, they spy on me through holes in my walls. They seem chill though. I felt something wet brush against my leg while I went to go have a shower. It was very strange and very uncomfortable. I had a shower, brushed my teeth, watered my plant, and checked the news. I also took my rent money and a first aid kit (just in case) and went to see what was happening in the rest of my apartment.

There was a trail of what appeared to be blood coming from room 36. I know I probably shouldn't, but I went to investigate. The TV is very loud. There was some money and a baseball bat on some tables in the apartment. I left the coins but took the bat (just in case).

Holy shit. So I found my neighbor in his bathroom. When I approached to ask about what was going on, he pulled a knife on me!? Asshole. He told me to look outside, just like he did. I don't think I'll be doing that. Then he started... stabbing himself. Then an eye appeared in his wound. It was mortifying. I dont know what's going on but it isn't good. Then I.  put him put of his misery. He needed to die. Him or me. I decided to raid the rest of his house. He probably wasn't using any of his stuff anymore anyway. I had to put down another person too, they were about to attack me (I think. I hope.) There was someone else in the room they were guarding where I found a safe. I decided I wanted to avoid needless violence.

I went back to my apartment and spoke with my weird neighbor again. Told them about what happened. And they had the GULL to tell me something like ""nothing too stressful, then?"" LIKE YES, IT WAS STRESSFUL. Decided to play some video games to de-stress. Fun.

I left the apartment. I think I've become numb to killing now. I killed like 5 people just to get to the 2nd floor. And to think violence used to make me queasy. Whatever. It's fine. Anyway, met this guy named Astor on floor 2. He said he's working with some astronomers, and that theres an extraterrestrial phenomenon passing through our solar system causing everything that's happening. It causes ""grave changes"" to living things that look at it. He told me if I wanted to help, to speak to his colleague Jasper on the ground floor. I kinda have my own issues to worry about at the moment, but maybe later.

This door said it wanted my help with something. I used my deductive reasoning to assume it was probably something BEHIND the door, not the door itself. I was right! It was a person named Jeanne. She looked very... unwell. She asked me to grab her laundry for her? Odd request, but I'll try I suppose. She said she isn't feeling well. I think she looked outside.

I got attacked by a giant monster while travsersing the hallway of floor 2. It hit like a god damn truck, so I pretended I was a bar of soap and gave it the slip. When I came back to the main area, there was a pistol and some ammo. Hell yeah. Has to use my first aid kit to not die though. Shame. I found Lyle's appartment key. I let myself in. He looks... bigger than I remember him. I asked to trade and he wanted to give me photo paper for, I kid you not, a kiss. ... ... and I decided why the hell not. Felt like putting my lips on a awfully hot coffee pot. And he took a picture. At least he looked happy. I also took his crossword puzzles. I don't actually like crosswords all that much, but they'll kill time if need be

So Lyle's roommate almost killed me. That's the 2nd near death experience today. Luckily, I'm faster and can juke my opponents so I got away. Wounded, but got away. There was a corpse when I explored by the basement. There was a note saying they were trying to get to the landlord's room for guns. I just went home after that. I'm exhausted. I cooked some pizza bites, played some video games, and turned in for the night.

I'm here to share my afsb experience and some of my journey here as demanded by fellow redditors.


About me: 
I was in 12th (June 2024) when I first got to know about the term nda. I gave the NDA 2 2024 as my first attempt (scored 380 in written) applied for army and had ssb at jalandhar in January but couldn't attend it because of my leg injury.

I was a jee aspirant throughout my 11th 12th and couldn't actually prepare for the nda exam or the ssb part. I just went raw every single time. 

Then on 1st Jan 2025, I registered myself for nda 1 2025 and applied for air force. 

Gave the exam and again qualified and got my afsb interview at dehradun on 23rd june. 

I couldn't actually ever prepare for the ssb process. I couldn't even attend any coaching because I never really told my parents that I'll be giving the nda exam, it was a surprise for them. 

_______________________

THE AFSB EXPERIENCE:

As soon as I reached there at 6am the gate were opened, I was really confident to see so many girls with boy cut and dressed up so well. There we had a quick document check for the entry(aadhar card, call up letter).

Then we kept our luggage under a shed unattended and told to carry pens and water bottle. (I carried extra so that I could give it to others too)
 We were also told to carry declaration form, TA form and 2 other forms with us.

Then 3 lines were made, for freshers, screened out and repeaters .
I joined the freshers line and we all proceeded to submit our forms in 3 labelled boxes. Then we went to the candidate's mess where we had breakfast (something like cornflakes khichdhi, coffee, bread butter sandwich and cutlet sort of thing).

After breakfast we made 3 lines again in the badminton court(adjacent to the mess). 

We then went to the arjan Singh hall where some briefing was done and normal question answer session.

We then went outside where our chest numbers were distributed (order was fresher's -screened outs-repeaters)

We then went again to the arjan Singh hall where we recieved a large examination board and were told to be seated number wise. 

Then we were briefed about the oir test. We firstly had a sample question paper which was already answered and explained by the sir. 
Then we gave a practice test. Then finally the real test.

50 questions , 27 mins for 1 set. We had to give total 2 sets

My oir went really well though. 

Then they gave us a sample picture for ppdt (the screen was HUGEEE). 
He also gave his ideas on that story. 

Then the real story for 30 secs(I was confused between 2 themes).
I started to write the story but was slow. I wrote many actions but by the end wasn't able to complete it by writing the conclusion.
So I quickly wrote 3 lines in those 5 second of noise. 

We then folded our sheets and made a line to proceed to the GD rooms.
I was only focusing on my narration and revising it again and again.

The gd room was literally so niceee , 14 chairs for 14 girls.

The process was briefed by a sir and then narration started.
Girls said their stories and some stumbled or even stopped in between.

In my turn I was really confident and narrated my story nicely with many emphasizes and modulation in voice along with expressions.

Also, I literally made eye contact with every single candidate when they were narrating and remembered all of their stories too.

As soon as the last candidate got over, the discussion started , it was literally a fish market way worse than what I thought.

The girl beside me was too dominating with her voice. She was kind of leading and also said that to avoid confusions, people should speak one by one from opposite ends (totally stupid but people actually followed her💀).

Nvm, my main goal was to bring the group to a common conclusions by introducing the common grounds and honestly I was doing good 

Then sir told us to nominate someone. I stayed quite but the girl beside me (yeah that one only) stood up and VERY CONFIDENTLY said ""guys I think I'm the best person here to be nominated and say the common story and I nominate myself "".

Then suddenly a veryyyy quite girl raised her voice when the group was silent and pointed towards me and nominated me to speak the story.

Bhaisahab I was literally not expecting that to happen but anyways I beautifully covered all the common points that the group discussed and then most probably justified everyone's decision.


After that we were again sent to that shed area to get our luggage and made a line (all together) and then the DSO mam spoke up chest numbers for those who got it. When my number was spoken I was literally soo happy but my expressions were really neutral.
And yeah that girl (self nomination)was screened out.

After the results we went to the main gate where we were allowed to call our parents on our phone for 5 mins before the submission.
And also we were briefed about the do's and don'ts at the stay.
I called my parents quickly and then my best friend too (hehe).

After the submission of phone and other electronic items in a locker whose keys were handled by us, our luggage was checked and then we all got proceeded to the gymnasium where we kept our luggage and took out the documents folder only.

Again went to Arjan Singh hall for documents verification and got the data too.

160 reporting, 159 for the screening test.
97 freshers/37 screened outs/25 repeaters.

Screened in: 41 freshers/14 screened outs/ 8 repeaters. (Total 63)

After the document verification we went for lunch and then got alloted our rooms and groups (my group 3 , room no. 4 baaz).

Chose beds and slept for a while. 

Rest of the story only on public demand😋😜.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Prediction: Novak Djokovic vs. Alexandre Muller – Wimbledon 2025**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis mismatch so lopsided, even the grass at Wimbledon is filing a restraining order against Alexandre Muller. Novak Djokovic, the 24-time Grand Slam champion, is a **-5000 favorite** to advance, which translates to a 98.04% implied probability. For context, that’s statistically more likely than me stopping mid-sentence to check if my coffee is still hot.

Muller, the 41st-ranked underdog, has **+2000 odds** (a 4.76% chance), which is about the same odds as me winning a bet that a sloth will outrun a cheetah. The only thing Muller might outrun here is his own confidence—per the news, he’s coming off four straight losses, including two straight-set shellackings on grass. Meanwhile, Djokovic has never lost a first-round match at Wimbledon and has a **98-12 career record** here. History, thy name is Novak.

**Key Props to Note:**

* **Muller to go OVER 10.5 games**: At -112, this feels like the only prop bet with a sliver of hope. Let’s be real, though—Muller’s likely to hit 11 games if Djokovic takes a 10-minute bathroom break mid-match.
* **UNDER 29.5 total games**: The line is set at 29.5, and with Djokovic’s straight-set dominance (he’s won his last four matches in straight sets), this feels like a math problem: 2 (sets) + 2 (more sets) = a nap for everyone after the first hour.

The spread is **Djokovic -8.5** across most books, which is as safe as betting the sun will rise tomorrow. Gary Pearson of sportsbookreview.com even predicts Djokovic will “shake off rust in the first set and cruise,” echoing their US Open clash where Novak won in 23 games. With Wimbledon’s sweltering heat (per CBS Sports) and Djokovic’s grass-court wizardry, Muller’s best shot is probably a lob to the moon… and even that’ll be returnable.

**Final Verdict**: Djokovic wins in straight sets, the UNDER 29.5 games cashes, and Muller’s OVER 10.5 games prop is the only prop with a prayer. If you bet against Djokovic, you’re either a masochist or a fan of financial self-harm. Pick your poison.

*“The only thing Muller has to fear is the Djokovic Djinni granting a wish… to end this match quickly.”* 🎾✨

**Ending 4G:**

Terry got to cash in his Hall Pass. Now that it’s over I’m kind of happy it happened so quickly. I really didn’t think it would, I figured he would be bitter and moody for weeks or months trying to find someone to have a one night stand with. Instead it only took him a few days on Ashley Madison. He traveled this past weekend to Marshfield. Booked himself a hotel room and met her. He told me that was the halfway point for them both to meet but wouldn’t tell me anything else about her. I find myself wondering now what she looks like, or just who she was. Probably for the best that I don’t know. 

We seem to be patching things up. We’ve had a few side effects from all of this. Terry is completely unable to enjoy his favorite kink. He begins having a panic attack anytime I even mention my past adventures. This used to get him so worked up, it’s kind of eye opening how a little trauma can flip the way someone looks at something. It’s not just stories that have to do with “The Reunion” either. I don’t bring those up at all, or about the “Graduation Party.” It’s all of them. I tried telling him my “Streak” story to get him worked up one day, and he had a total mental breakdown. That story has nothing to do with group sex or any of those people.

We’re adjusting though. I will say our communication seems to be improving. Terry still seems pretty closed off about his feelings regarding this situation, but he is more willing to share his thoughts and feelings about our marriage overall. I’m mostly giving him time and letting him go at his own pace. He’s retreated into his phone more lately. I don’t press him though, and he is present when he puts it down. I’m just hoping this is a temporary thing. Still I understand and am willing to wait it out. 

**Epilogue-4G**

He had already slept with her. He asked me for a Hall Pass, gave me an ultimatum that it was either that or divorce, when he had already slept with her. 

This all came out in the most dramatic way. We were still feeling out reconciling, but it had been a few weeks of living together again. Things were going smooth, I was doing my best to keep from triggering him by mentioning anything that was even remotely relatable to my group sex experiences. Whether those be recent or a decade earlier. Then one day when I got Terry to run to the local coffee shop for me, he bumped into Joan of all people. She told me he awkwardly said hello and scurried away lightning fast. When he got home he was a total mess. Full on panic attack. I got him calmed down, reassured him, let him get whatever he needed out of his system. Then, I insisted he go take a hot shower to feel better. He didn’t argue and went on his way. I went to go clean up the coffee as Terry had accidentally dropped it on our hardwood floors when he got back from his run in with Joan. That mess and everything else had just exacerbated the whole melt down. While all that was happening Terry had unloaded a lot of the items he was carrying, including his cell phone. I guess in his heightened state he forgot to clear his notifications, because I saw some rather intriguing texts from a number that said, “Andy.” 

Turns out Andy is actually Amy. Amy was Terry’s high school girlfriend. This bitch is recently divorced, and after her divorce, for some reason she thought it would be okay to message my husband to “catch up.” She had messaged him a few days before I went on the “Reunion” trip. Terry left her on read until about two days after the trip. 

I read their entire message history. Pretty sure Terry realized he had left his phone unattended, because he came zooming out of the front of our house in just a towel as I was driving off with his phone. I went down to a park that I did not frequent. Parked the car and just read and read. They moved quick when Terry messaged her. He made it seem like he was long separated from me during those few days before their first in person encounter. I asked him why he decided to meet me and allow for reconciliation when he had just had sex with his ex-girlfriend the day before. He told me it was sleeping with her that made him feel guilty, and he thought giving us a chance was the right thing to do. But then he began going back and forth on it, so he decided to ask for the hall pass. Terry told me this was some half assed attempt at “Getting Amy out of his system.” 

Reading through their messages, he tells her that he’s married and going to give it another shot, and in the same breath tells her that he has a hall pass and would like to meet one more time. She is all for this, bitch doesn’t give two shits that he’s married. 

After their 2nd physical encounter, the one I unknowingly agreed to, he sent her a goodbye message. That goodbye lasted all of 30 hours when he sent her, “I just can’t stop thinking about you.” She responded immediately and they’ve been carrying on an emotional affair this whole time. When I came back home and confronted Terry, he didn’t even seem upset. He just said, “Well, I guess you know now.” There was nothing in his tone. No remorse, no guilt. I began to cry and he told me, “I know you’re upset, but I got nothing for you. I want to be with Amy, I’ve fallen in love with her these last few weeks. My feelings for you ended up stunted the moment you left for “The Reunion” and that hasn’t gotten better. I’m sorry it ends like this, but it does end like this.” 

I am completely devastated, more so I’m very pissed off. I know I fucked up, but my indiscretion was completely sexual, this was not, this was feelings. This was worse. I’m not fighting any of it, I want out too. She can have him, he can have her. It may not be the ending I wanted, but it's probably the only way things were ever going to end.

**Post Epilogue-4G**

I literally don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore. I look in the mirror and hate the man I see. Three years ago I divorced my then wife, Trish, and got remarried to my current wife, Amy. Amy and I had an affair prior to going legit. It wasn’t without cause, Trish had cheated on me, that’s how Amy and I got started. Still, starting a relationship on the back of infidelity isn’t the best way to start. 

Things between Amy and I were good for awhile. She was a breath of fresh air, much more inexperienced with relationships and sex than Trish had been. I found I really liked being the more dominant and sexual partner. In day-to-day life, I enjoyed Amy’s practical personality and predictable behavior. A far cry from the exciting chaos Trish created.  

Over time though I got more and more bored. There was no spontaneity, no passion. I found myself craving anything different. And that’s why I reached out to my ex-wife Trish. I told myself it was just to say hello but from the time I started typing those first words I knew how I wanted this to end. 

Yesterday, it happened. I cheated on Amy with Trish. I’m not even sure at this point if Trish did it because she wanted me, or just to spite Amy. I guess it doesn’t really matter. I hate myself for it but I deserve to be happy too. I’m planning on coming clean to Amy, and asking for a divorce. I think our reconnection is ultimately the proof I needed that we are soul mates. 

**Post Post Epilogue-4G**    

Okay, so turns out Trish was just trying to get vengeance. She sent a bunch of evidence to Amy. After she did that she sent me a message, It read, “Hope you enjoyed your pity fuck, it will 100% be the last time, hope that cunt divorces you. Fuck off forever! -Trish.” 

Amy is divorcing me, so um….I guess…..Trish and I might not be soul mates. Fuck me right?",1,1751392491.0,Fiction_Stories,0,1.0,False

Through my 4 years of highschool I had this on and off crush on this guy. Well in all honesty he was my ""first love"" I fell hard for this guy. But it was on and off because he would get back with his ex for short terms. Summer after our junior year  we ""talked"" during the summer and as the school year started he just stopped. I know when to take a hint. He got into 2 more relationships. The second one I knew the girl prior to them dating just casually, friendly to one another but not necessarily friends. Once they started dating she unfollowed me and it was quite awkward because she worked next door to my old job where I frequently got coffee. Getting past that lately (for the past 3 days) he's been in my dreams. I wake up constantly through the night unable to sleep and each time I happen to fall asleep he's right back in my dreams again. My friend mentioned something about being interlinked because of unspoken words.

1lp8aed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1lp8aed/what_were_nietzches_opinions_on_homosexuality/,What were Nietzche’s opinions on Homosexuality?,"Hi all, I have a question. I was in a coffee shop before work, and I was reading Thus Spake Zarathustra as I waited for my daily tea and bagel. I caught a boy who could have been no older than twenty looking at me, and asked him why. He said a close friend of his is an Iranian Zoroastrian, and so he was interested in what I might be reading. I preceded to tell him about how great Nietzche was, and that I was reading the peak of psychology, ethics, and all around truth. He started shrinking away from me a little, and seemed uncomfortable when he left.

Anyways, he was a very beautiful young man. Thin eyes, fair skin, curly black hair, a very musical way of speaking and a small amount of body hair for his age. I'm very much not gay, but I'd like to pursue this boy.

What is the most Nietzchean way to go about this? Should I drug him and force myself on him in order to exercise my will to power? Obviously, morality is a farce created by the weak so that they may restrain the strong, and this boy is very thin and effeminate, and likely softened by an affluent upbringing as well, so I think he's probably pretty weak. Does this mean by violating him I would be valiantly opposing the foolish teachings of the abrahamic religions?

I consider Nietzche something of a stern grandfather who teaches me discipline and levelheadedness, and I don't want to disappoint him. Would he approve of our relationship? Would he want me to use a condom? How should I go about this?

1lp85ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1lp85ty/how_a_rookie_mistake_led_me_down_a_network/,"How a rookie mistake led me down a network troubleshooting rabbit hole, and reminded me how important subnetting is","Over the weekend, I installed Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero to act as a DNS-based ad blocker for my home network. It was working perfectly for devices connected to my LAN, blocking known ad/tracker domains as expected.

But I wanted that same protection when I’m away from home. My router supports OpenVPN, so I set that up to tunnel traffic back through the LAN. The VPN tunnel came up cleanly, and the client was assigned an IP in the [10.8.0.0/24](http://10.8.0.0/24) range.

The goal was to have all DNS traffic from the VPN client routed through Pi-hole (10.0.0.2). But it wasn’t working.

Initial symptoms:

✅ VPN tunnel working — client got 10.8.x.x address

✅ Could ping other devices on the LAN (like 10.0.0.4)

❌ Could not ping [10.0.0.2](http://10.0.0.2) (Pi-hole) or SSH to it over the VPN.

❌ DNS resolution bypassing the pi-hole

I SSH'd to a different client behind the VPN and used that to SSH to the Pi-hole and ran some Initial checks:

`netstat -tuln`showed Pi-hole was listening on port 53

`tcpdump -i any port 53 and host` [`10.8.0.6`](http://10.8.0.6) confirmed DNS queries were hitting the Pi-hole

But the VPN client never got a response.

The (stupidly simple) mistake:

I had manually assigned a static IP to the Pi-hole using NetworkManager, but I didn’t specify the subnet so it defaulted to a /8. That meant the Pi-hole believed everything in 10.x.x.x was on the local LAN.

So when it received a DNS query from a VPN client (10.8.0.6), it tried to respond directly instead of routing back through the tunnel.

Even worse: I had made the same mistake on both eth0 and wlan0.

Complicating issues, I was working remotely in a coffee shop and trying to fix this over the VPN connection.

Fortunately, I had left Wi-Fi active on the Pi-hole specifically for backup access if I ever messed up the wired config.

Here’s what I did:

Used `nmcli` to reconfigure both interfaces to use /24 subnets:

`nmcli con modify ""Wired connection 1"" ipv4.addresses` [`10.0.0.2/24`](http://10.0.0.2/24)  
`nmcli con modify ""Wired connection 1"" ipv4.gateway` [`10.0.0.1`](http://10.0.0.1)  
`nmcli con modify ""Wired connection 1"" ipv4.method manual`  
  
But I had to bring the interface down and back up again to apply the change.

I ran:

`nmcli con down ""Wired connection 1"" && nmcli con up ""Wired connection 1""`  
  
As I feared, I lost connection over eth0, but I was able to re-connect on the WiFi interface so I was able to bring eth0 back up and then do the same for the Wireless interface.

Verified routing table:

`ip route` and confirmed both interfaces had correct /24 netmasks.

Ok, cool.  Now I can ping the Pi-hole box and SSH to it directly instead of jumping through a different host.

But how to get my VPN client (a Windows machine) to use the Pi-hole as a DNS server?  Unfortunately, the OpenVPN implementation on my router doesn't let me specify a DNS server address for clients.

The solution: Manually edit the .ovpn config file to include:  
  
`dhcp-option DNS` [`10.0.0.2`](http://10.0.0.2) Then re-imported the config and reconnected.

The client was now sending queries to the right IP , but they were STILL timing out.

Final fix:

Turns out, by default, Pi-hole only responds to DNS queries from clients within its own subnet.

To allow it to respond to VPN clients in the [10.8.0.0/24](http://10.8.0.0/24) range, I had to go into the Pi-hole web UI and change:

Settings > DNS > Interface settings → Set to ""Respond only on interface eth0""

Once that was applied:  
  
✅ DNS resolution over VPN worked  
✅ Ad blocking worked  
✅ Logging in Pi-hole confirmed the VPN client was sending all queries through it

Lessons learned:

Always specify the subnet when setting a static IP.

Misconfigured subnets don’t always cause total failure, sometimes they fail just enough to waste hours.

1lp84ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lp84ki/why_choose_the_vevor_water_boiler_eka32ed_for/,Why Choose the VEVOR Water Boiler EKA-3.2ED for Your Kitchen Needs?,"Testing out the VEVOR EKA-3.2ED has become part of my daily routine, and I’ve got to say, this hot water dispenser brings some unique features to the table. It feels like they’ve thought about the little annoyances of traditional models and tried to iron them out in a practical and stylish design. The stainless-steel, polished finish adds a premium look that fits seamlessly into my kitchen’s modern decor.

**Thoughtful Design for Everyday Use**  
The first thing I noticed was the compact design. With dimensions of 11""L x 8.5""W x 13""H, it’s relatively small and doesn’t take up too much counter space. I use it for coffee in the morning, tea in the evening, and even to warm bottles when friends with babies visit. The lightweight handle makes moving the dispenser around super straightforward, even when full of water. Its rotating base means I just swivel it to reach without dragging it across the counter—a feature I never knew I’d love so much! Cleaning is also refreshingly easy since the lid separates for a thorough cleaning session.

**Precision Temperature Control Delivers Versatile Results**  
The 4 temperature settings—208.4°F, 185°F, 140°F, and 104°F—cater to pretty much every hot beverage or culinary need. For example, I’ve been able to prepare green tea at the perfect mid-range temperature, something cheaper kettles either overheat or underheat. And if the idea of trying to figure this out sounds like another chore, the labeled buttons make it idiot-proof. Plus, the 680-watt heating element gets water boiling quickly, so impatient mornings aren’t as brutal.

**Safety Features for a Worry-Free Experience**  
As someone who sometimes forgets things on the counter, the dry-burn protection is a lifesaver. If the water gets too low, the machine shuts itself off, saving both the unit and possibly me from an expensive electricians’ visit. The child lock feature was another standout, though I mostly tested it when my niece came over. She’s a curious one, but she couldn’t figure out how to get the water flowing. It’s also reassuring safety-wise if elderly family members are around.

**Highlights**  
- Rotating base for easy access.  
- Lightweight and portable with heat-resistant handle.  
- Four precise temperature settings for customized use.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The overall capacity of 3.2 quarts is decent but might feel limiting during larger gatherings.  
- Though the handle feels solid, it could’ve been slightly more padded for better grip when carrying a full tank of water.  

**Three-Way Dispense: A Game Changer or Overkill?**  
This feature intrigued me the most. Having three options to dispense water seemed a bit excessive at first—automatic, cup switch, and manual—but it’s grown on me. Auto-dispensing is perfect when both hands are occupied, while the manual works great during unexpected power outages. I even found the ""Sabbath mode"" convenient for friends in observant households, allowing manual dispensing without any electrical triggers.

**Premium Build Quality Matters**  
Not all dispensers are created equal, and this one doesn’t cut corners with materials. The inner liner, spout, and interior cover are made of 304 food-grade stainless steel. Aside from keeping rust at bay, everything about the machine feels robust. This durability becomes particularly evident when comparing it to similar water boilers that either feel flimsy or wear down quickly.

**Rival Brands: Standing Out in the Competition**  
Stacking this water heater against competitors like the Zojirushi and Hamilton Beach models, there are clear trade-offs. The Zojirushi has a larger capacity and more extensive temperature controls, which might appeal to those brewing in bulk. However, it comes at a notably higher price. Meanwhile, Hamilton Beach offers affordability but lacks the premium features like Sabbath mode or food-grade stainless steel. The VEVOR unit strikes a balance—it’s durable, has versatile settings, and doesn’t shock your wallet quite as hard as some other models.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its feature-packed setup—multiple temperature controls, three-way dispense options, and safety-driven qualities—I’d say it offers excellent value. It may not be the cheapest water dispenser out there, but balancing price with functionality, it does justify the cost. You’ll likely end up paying significantly more for comparable stainless-steel models with similar versatility.

So much so every day I'm seeing 3-5 full adults chilling around. Even if it was just one I have a feeling I'd be up against a wall. 

See I'm used to living in a fenced in poor neighborhood with at best birds and come cats coming through. Maybe a raccoon or possum. But in this place I live in now they have the wide open naturalist approach and the yards and forests are TEEEEEEMING which I have no issues with. I love it. Except for the murderous rabbits. Those bastards have eaten almost every sunflower I ground plant. This time they have taken another and I have one left in the ground. I've tried cages, cinnamon, coffee. The coffee and cinnamon suggested doesn't really work and the sunflowers quickly outgrow the cages. Well this time one little bastard uprooted the whole cage and took a single bit out of the 3ft tall stalk and left the rest. Just one bite and left it to die. Unlike the others it just vaporized it like they never existed. 

What makes it worse is this is the ONE plant my lady wanted to grow in the yard and it just sucks seeing her get defeated about it over and over and over again. So now I get to tell her when she comes home that the best sunflower we have was vengefully struck down by a pissed off rabbit that didn't even eat it. 

I really don't know what to do. I knew rabbits were a problem but not like this. I. The image the one of the left was the one destroyed this time and I feel like the right one is an inevitably. I want to save it. I want to see my girl smile at having at least one bloom.

One partner was in, and the other wanted to “do research,” so I nudged him along by giving our documentation, results, neighbors who already did it, savings numbers, and the official program paperwork.

Then I built a gap, and it turns out they had done an AC upgrade when the weather was hot (completely unrelated to my SaaS).

I asked if he’d consult his business partner before changing AC. He said no. So how was this different? And so, he admitted it wasn’t, but still hit me with “I need to think.” I asked what happens if he waits 6-12 months and their costs keep going up.

Dude actually told me “Buddy, I’ll call you back, trust me.” He gave me a free coffee to get rid of me. I threw it away the second I walked out of the building, which I took as “this is my gift to you so you leave peacefully.”

Today, he calls AND texts me, begging to buy. I was genuinely shocked when his number popped up and froze for a moment.

My problem: see video. Almost nothing comes out of the brew group, everything runs normally from the steam valve. 

Yes, I've seen the videos with the cleaning trick. I've tried it several times and it has at least helped a little, so that I could at least make one or two halfway decent coffees before nothing came out again. However, as I don't have a repair service nearby in my current living situation, I can't take it anywhere. After researching the result: it can only be the solenoid valve, watched videos, saw that it's not that difficult to repair yourself. So I took it out, cleaned it, put it back in, plugged it in, looking forward to a coffee, started it up and... nothing, still the same problem. So: Watched the next video: Remove the boiler, clean it, reinstall it. That was the plan. Removed the boiler, opened it up and saw that the whole thing was eaten away from the inside (which explains the black pieces that came out when the water was dispensed via the steam valve. So I ordered a new boiler and replaced the two thermostats, soaked everything in cleaning solution again and cleaned it (solenoid valve and brew group).

Now I have reinstalled everything, was proud of myself for a moment that I managed to do it all myself (I don't really like doing such repair work), connected the coffee machine, switched it on, in joyful anticipation of finally being able to make a decent coffee again, result: See video.

Still nothing, but the steam valve remains unchanged.

While in a deep sleep, I heard my husband ask me if I wanted to sit outside with him. It woke me up but I hadn’t opened my eyes yet and I said “yes” out-loud. He didn’t say anything back which is what caused me to open my eyes and when I did, he was not there. It didn’t feel like a dream bc his voice sounded like it was outside of my head and I heard him loud enough to wake me up to the point of consciously responding. So I called for him, he walked over to me and I asked him “didn’t you ask me to go outside with you?” And he said “no but that’s weird you say that because I was just thinking about asking you that when I walked past you. But I didn’t say anything because I wanted to make you coffee first before I woke you up.” He never said anything out loud but I heard his thought. 

On another occasion a couple months ago, I had a “dream” that my dog verbally asked me to take her outside because she had to poop really bad. (My 10 year old dog has never woken us up to take her outside in the middle of the night or early hours, she sleeps as long as we do). The moment I woke up and opened my eyes, it’s like she knew her message reached me and she came running to me with her usual cues that tell me she has to poop and she was acting very desperate to go outside fast and she immediately went the moment she touched grass (normally she circles around for 5-10 min before finally going). 

I’m not sure what this is because it doesn’t feel like a hallucination but more of like I’m tuning into my husband’s and dog’s minds like I’m reading them in my sleep. Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone know what this is called? Curious if this is something I can strengthen too…

Hey everyone!

I'm currently using [smartcrop.py](https://github.com/smartcrop/smartcrop.py) for image cropping in Python, but it's pretty basic. It only detects edges and color gradients, not actual objects.

For example, if I have a photo with a coffee cup, I want it to recognize the cup as the main subject and crop around it. But smartcrop just finds areas with most edges/contrast, which often misses the actual focal point.

**Looking for:**

* Python library that uses AI/ML for object-aware cropping
* Can identify main subjects (people, objects, etc.)
* More modern than just edge detection

Any recommendations for libraries that actually understand what's in the image?

I have seen so many Officers like you,

make their first step on this Station. 

Ready to do their job. 

Till they look out of these windows,

into the endless abyss, 

so close and deadly,

yet far enough way,

that most people have a bigger problem getting a coffee,

than maintaining their Survival. 



But that brings us back to Officers like you.

Some look out and see their Potential and drive. 

Turning the Unkown into the Known. 

Some look at the Void and run. 

As Facing it, even a fraction is a dangerous plan. 

But Running only gets you so far. 

And others look at it,

the endless nothingness and get mad. 



Thats something, no one gets back from,

at least no one i have ever met. 

So tell me, what do you see?



\*waiting for the Listener\*



Well, give it a bit more time. 

Take a deep breath in and breath out. 

You can feel it pulling on you, cant you?

You are trying to look away, 

as your mind is searching for something. 



You need to relax, fighting it,

will only drive you mad. 

Do you want to give to that feeling

or do you want to focus on my voice?

I wonder if you noticed how heavy your eyes already are?

You want to close them,

but something in the dark. 

Something is looking back already. 



You are already falling into it, deeper and deeper. 

deeper and deeper. 

as you float, float into the void. 

do you think there is something waiting. 

As you relax, deeper and deeper. 

Letting your mind drop. 



Or maybe the thing you should be scared of,

is so much closer. 

As you already dropped down so much,

willing to let me take control. 

You want to follow my command, dont you?



Oh my darling Officer,

i had my eyes on you, since i approved your file. 

I knew, getting you here,

would make it so easy to take control. 

Sadly, i dont have a use for you yet. 

So, i will count from 1 to 10. 

Which each number, you will become more and more awake. 

You will however stay willing to listen to my voice. 

Ready to obey my commands.

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10



So, my darling Officer, what do you think?

What is the darkness doing to you?

1lp7k7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lp7k7h/the_girl_only_i_remember/,The Girl Only I Remember,"When I was 7, there was a girl named Marwa. She wasn’t just a friend — she was part of my everyday life. From age 7 to 10, almost everything in my world revolved around her. I used to go to her place every single day. I knew her mom, her six sisters, the layout of their home, the smell of their kitchen, the sound of their doorbell, and even her mom’s sleepy morning voice: “Good morning, you woke up early today.” Marwa was quiet, detached. She didn’t like her parents — not in a dramatic way, just neutral, like they didn’t matter. She was always on her sister’s laptop, barely spoke, but she loved me. She never played with anyone else. She’d wait for me every day like I was the only thing keeping her grounded. I was the social one. She was withdrawn. But being with her felt still, comforting in a way I still can’t explain. I remember the tiniest things. The time I woke up early and went to her house before anyone else was up. Her mom made coffee, the smell filled the flat, I rang the doorbell, and she greeted me with that familiar line. I sat on the couch — I still remember how it felt — and waited until Marwa appeared, half-asleep, eyes barely open. I remember the day we fought over a toy and I broke it. I remember my mom getting involved. I remember the ring — the one I always believed she gave me. There are photos of me as a kid wearing that ring. But when I asked my mom, she said it was a gift from my aunt. Still, every time I look at it, I feel like Marwa gave it to me. And then she started fading. Not all at once — slowly. We stopped playing. Sometimes we’d just smile at each other from a distance. Eventually, nothing. She was gone. Years later, I asked my mom about her. “Do you remember Marwa? The girl I used to visit all the time?” She looked confused. “Who’s Marwa? Are you talking about a doll or something?” I explained the house, the family, the exact location. She swore no one like that ever lived there. Only an older woman, alone, who stayed a few months and left. No kids. No daughters. I asked my dad — he confirmed the same story, word for word. Asked my aunt — same thing. No one remembered anything. Not the neighbors. Not my family. No one. But me? I remember everything. My mom told me once that when I was little, I used to go on and on about a girl named Marwa, but she thought it was the name of one of my toys. It wasn’t. Marwa wasn’t a toy. She was real. She mattered to me. What scares me more than anything? This isn’t the only time I’ve felt reality slip. Since I was a child, I’ve had moments — long, quiet moments — where I feel completely disconnected, like I’m watching life through thick glass, like the world around me isn’t fully here. But with Marwa, those moments went away. She was more real than anything. And then, just like that, she was gone. And everyone swears she never existed, that the apartment was always empty, that no such girl ever lived there. But I spent three years with her. I held her hand. I heard her voice. I felt her silence. There is no way a child’s brain invents a fully-formed person — with her own family, her own room, her laptop, her smell, her personality — and sustains that illusion for three entire years. I’m not looking for validation. I just need to know: has anyone else experienced something like this? Someone only you remember? Someone who vanished — not just from the world, but from everyone’s memory? I don’t know if I imagined her, or if I was allowed to see something no one else could. All I know is this: I wasn’t alone. Marwa was with me. And even now, in some way, she still is.",1,1751390349.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1lp7jum,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1lp7jum/i_had_to_say_goodbye_to_my_childhood_dog/,i had to say goodbye to my childhood dog yesterday in a very sudden way,"Daisy was a beautiful bouncy mischievous little lhasa apso-poodle mix. you would have never known she was 15 years old. other than a heart murmur graded 2/6 and a history of very short 3 seizures that each occurred 6 months apart, she was in relatively good health. she did have some bad teeth, so we ran labs and did a check up and decided she would be a good candidate for a dental procedure. she had the procedure last thursday and did great under anesthesia and had 2 teeth removed. when i brought her home she was sleepy, but perked up a few hours later and was drinking water but didnt have an appetite. the next morning she still didnt have an appetite, but she was due for a dose of meloxicam. the instructions said she should take it with food. i called her vet and her regular vet was on vacation, but the on call vet said to give her the medication anyways because maybe she wasnt eating because she was in pain. so i followed her instructions. the vet just warned that she may have some gi upset. she still didnt want to eat throughout the day and still seemed a little spacey but i figured the anesthesia was still wearing off.

around 2am saturday morning, she started having diarrhea. and then it became more frequent. maybe around 6am i noticed that she had a few spots of bright blood in her stool, but that is something she has had in the past and when i spoke to her doctors about it previously they that was usually due to irritation near the anus, so thats what i figured was happening. then it suddenly got so much worse in the morning. like a lot of clear liquid tinged with blood. 2 times during the night she was begging to get on the bed with me and i would hold and comfort her, but then she would suddenly just walk off the bed. shes a rambunctious pup and always jumping off things etc., but when she fell it seemed to have bruised her back. i feel like a horrible person about that. i wasnt able to get her into an emergency vet until 10 due to wait times and some vets just not picking up their phones. so 8 hrs after symptoms started.

this first emergency vet then rated her murmur at a 5/6 and said she was very dehydrated and said she had something i had never heard of before - hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. but after like 6 hours of fluids they graded the murmur at 3/6, got her hopped up on opioids, and said she was good to go home but just make sure she eats and drinks. they didnt have an overnight vet that day. on the way out a vet tech stopped me and told me that she was seriously concerned about daisy and that these patients are usually kept for 3 days, so to please call if anything changes.

i brought her home and within 15 minutes we were back in the car heading to a different emergency vet. she was crying with every breath she took and hyperventilating. when the new vet was done triaging her, they said she was extremely dehydrated and the murmur was up to a 4 again. they told me they actually used naloxone on her because of the opiods. she spent saturday night at this vet.

i visited her on sunday and she seemed better, with no more blood in the stool and the stool was more formed. she hung out in my lap and took a nap, she greatly needed some rest. she did soil herself twice, and this time the poop was greenish. the vet said lets do one more night oj fluids and antibiotics in the clinic and hopefully she could come home on monday.

on monday around 9:45 i got a call from the vet that things took a turn for the worse and she had more internal bleeding. it was time. i couldn’t believe it. i picked up my fiance and we rushed over to see her. we layed down a blanket outside under some beautiful pine trees for her, and stayed with her for about 30 min. i didnt want to prolong her discomfort and had to make the call. she was asleep when it happened and she passed so peacefully. my baby girl.

im in shock and denial. this same little doggy that was jumping up on my coffee table to steal my sliced cucumbers (her favorite) on wednesday is now gone. i never saw this coming. i thought after the dental procedure we were in the clear.

i wish i never did the dental procedure. i wish that when i called the next day about the meloxicam, they would have told me when i should call an emergency vet and what hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is. i wish i would’ve taken her in the second i saw blood. i wish i would’ve slept on the floor with her so she wouldn’t have fallen off the bed. i wish i would’ve taken her to a vet that had overnight care, but i didnt know. i wish i wouldve taken her to the second vet we went to in the first place, they seemed much more competent. i only went to the first one because we’ve been there before and had great results. i wish we had more time.

i feel like i was a good owner and i spoiled this dog rotten. daisy was my whole world. even my mother told me that i always put daisy’s needs before my own. and i wish i would’ve been thinking straight this weekend and have been a better owner. but i wasnt. i cant help but feel an immense amount of guilt. this was preventable.

she was beautiful and so sweet up until her last moments. i added the last photo i have of her before it was time for her to leave earth. i am so heartbroken and empty and in denial. rest easy my sweet daisy bean - 5/5/2010-6/30/2025.

I currently do not have health insurance, so when I did visit the doctors, I had to pay for all of my tests out of pocket. I had been tested for UTIs, STIs, and BV twice, had a urine culture done, and a pregnancy test, of course, which all cost me close to a grand. These tests all came back negative. After doing my own personal research, I decided to diagnose myself with IC. I had a bad couple of weeks with flares lasting usually 1-2 days or a couple of hours. This was a couple of months ago, and then I started eliminating things from my diet, especially coffee and soda. I started taking boron and aloe vera gel capsules after my last flare-up, about a month and a half ago. I was able to drink, eat acidic foods, have a small amount of coffee, drink soda now and then, and have sex with almost no problem as long as I was pretty hydrated. Well, this changed a couple of days ago, and I am currently having a very painful flare. I work 3 jobs, where 2 are not sedentary at all, and trying to go to work with a flare is actually hell.

Aroma was indescribable but I'll try. Herbal, fruity, strong, coconut flavor and rosehips really came through. Even the coffee beans (???) in it were neat. Very mild though, I'm thinking of adding more black tea in with it as the tea flavor was very mild.

Second steep (212F, 4min 30 seconds) was actually nicer, the fruity flavours more subtle and a cinnamon and black tea flavor more at the forefront.

While the right has embraced one single word as the rallying cry for their entire movement, the left has truly failed where they always do: Messaging.

There are always a hundred different signs, a hundred different causes, and protests become toothless when they don't have a clear and concise demand. They lose all their momentum when scattered and allowed to be directed countless ways.

And so I am proposing an ideal battle cry. It doesn't encompass everything, but it can gain strength with repetition, and be something to pour all your ire and frustration into: RESIGN.

I'm not by any means going to say this will work on the man at the top. He will likely have to be dragged out. HOWEVER. There is an entire infrastructure of politicians who are voting through his bills. Refusing to check his power in the courts. Refusing to deny war actions or tariffs. And those people are not nearly as afraid of the pressure of their constituents as they should be.

And so, this rallying cry is for them. Anyone who doesn't oppose trump? RESIGN. Daily in their inbox. In their voicemails. In their social media. RESIGN. If they cannot listen to the people, they need to step down. They need to feel the pressure in every single point of their life. They shouldn't be able to get a cup of coffee without ""Resign <3"" being scrawled on the cup.

It will take coordinated effort. But I do think if people can simplify and amplify one simple message it can gain some momentum.

Of course, I know, there will be people in the comments going ""Oh peaceful protest isn't going to work any more. Telling them we are upset won't work."" Maybe! But organizing is the first step.

The first and most critical thing to understand is that IELTS Writing is not just a test of ""good English."" It's a test of your ability to perform specific tasks according to a very specific set of rules. A native speaker who doesn't understand these rules will likely not get a Band 9.1 Your entire preparation must be built on the foundation of the four official marking criteria. Each one is worth exactly 25% of your marks for each task, so they are all equally important.3 Internalizing these criteria is the most important step you can take.2

## 1.2 The Four Pillars of a Perfect Score: A Forensic Breakdown

Let's dissect the official Band 9 descriptors and translate them from ""examiner-speak"" into practical, actionable goals.8

### Task Achievement (TA) for Task 1 / Task Response (TR) for Task 2
**Official Descriptor:** ""fully addresses all parts of the task,"" ""presents a fully developed position in answer to the question with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas"".9
**Practical Meaning:** This is your ability to answer the question, the whole question, and nothing but the question. If the prompt asks for advantages and disadvantages, you must cover both in detail. If it asks for your opinion, you must state it clearly in the introduction and maintain it consistently.10 A Band 9 response doesn't just mention ideas; it
fully extends them with detailed explanations and supports them with specific, relevant examples.1 Every single part of the prompt must be comprehensively addressed.10

### Coherence and Cohesion (CC)
**Official Descriptor:** ""uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention,"" ""skilfully manages paragraphing"".8
**Practical Meaning:** This is the ""flow"" of your writing. For a Band 9, this flow must be so smooth and logical that the structure is essentially invisible. The reader follows your argument effortlessly, without noticing the mechanics. This is achieved through two key elements:
* **Logical Paragraphing:** Each paragraph must have one single, central idea. Mixing ideas in a paragraph will destroy your CC score.15
* **Seamless Cohesion:** This goes beyond just using linking words. It involves a sophisticated and varied use of cohesive devices—like pronouns, substitution, and conjunctions—so that they are not clunky or mechanical. A Band 9 writer doesn't just throw in ""Moreover"" at the start of a sentence; they connect ideas in a way that feels completely natural.3

### Lexical Resource (LR)
**Official Descriptor:** ""uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control,"" ""rare minor errors occur only as 'slips'"".8
**Practical Meaning:** This is about much more than just using ""big words."" It's about precision, flexibility, and sophistication. You use less common vocabulary not to impress, but because it's the exact word needed for the context. A huge part of this is the skillful use of collocations—words that naturally go together (e.g., ""take urgent action,"" ""highly competitive,"" ""foster engagement"").8 Your control of word formation and spelling is so good that any errors are clearly just typos, not knowledge gaps.

### Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA)
**Official Descriptor:** ""uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy,"" ""rare minor errors occur only as 'slips'"".8
**Practical Meaning:** A Band 9 response demonstrates mastery over grammar. You must use a wide variety of sentence structures—simple, compound, and complex—to convey your ideas with precision.7 The key is flexibility and control. The overwhelming majority of your sentences are completely error-free. Punctuation is not an afterthought; it is used perfectly to enhance clarity.3 Again, any mistakes are minor ""slips"" (like a typo you missed), not fundamental errors.

## 1.3 The Leap from Band 7 to Band 9

Many candidates get stuck at Band 7. The jump to Band 9 isn't just about making fewer mistakes; it's a fundamental shift from competence to mastery. A Band 7 writer shows they can control the language; a Band 9 writer uses it with such sophistication that the control is effortless and invisible.
The Band 7 descriptors describe a ""Good User"" who ""generally handles complex language well"" but with ""occasional inaccuracies"".3 This implies a conscious effort that is mostly, but not always, successful. In contrast, the Band 9 descriptors point to an ""Expert User"" with ""fully operational command"" where the language use is ""natural and sophisticated"" and the cohesion ""attracts no attention"".3 The difference is the
naturalness. A Band 7 response might have good linking words, but they feel deliberate. A Band 9 response weaves them in so they are unnoticeable. A Band 7 uses good vocabulary; a Band 9 uses the perfect word with sophisticated control of collocations.8
To make this concrete, here is a table breaking down the key upgrades needed to move from a strong Band 7 to an expert Band 9.

| Criterion | What a Band 7 Looks Like 8 | What a Band 9 Looks Like 8 | The Key Upgrade |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Task Response (TR)** | Presents a clear position throughout the response. Addresses all parts of the task, although some parts may be more fully covered than others. | Presents a fully developed position in answer to the question with relevant, fully extended and well supported ideas. | From ""clear"" to ""fully developed."" From ""addressing"" to ""fully extending and supporting"" every single part of the question. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion (CC)** | Logically organises information and ideas; there is a clear progression. Uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately, though there may be some over/under use. | Uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention. Skilfully manages paragraphing. | From ""clear progression"" to ""effortless flow."" Cohesive devices become invisible and paragraphing is masterful. |
| **Lexical Resource (LR)** | Uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision. Uses less common vocabulary with some awareness of style and collocation. | Uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features. | From ""sufficient"" to ""wide and sophisticated."" From ""awareness of collocation"" to ""natural control"" of it. Precision is key. |
| **Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA)** | Uses a variety of complex structures. Frequently produces error-free sentences. Has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make a few errors. | Uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy. Rare minor errors occur only as 'slips'. | From ""variety"" to ""wide range with full flexibility."" From ""frequent error-free sentences"" to a response that is virtually error-free. |

# Part 2: A Two-Pronged Attack: Mastering Task 1 and Task 2

You have 60 minutes to complete two tasks. Task 2, the essay, is worth twice as many marks as Task 1, so your strategy must reflect this.3

## 2.1 The Essay (Task 2): The Heart of Your Score (40 mins, 250+ words)

The single most important secret to a high-scoring essay is this: the quality of your argument development is far more important than the complexity of your ideas. Examiners are not grading how ""smart"" your ideas are. They are grading how well you can take a relevant idea, explain it in detail, and support it with a strong example.2 High-scorers on this very subreddit have confirmed this: ""You don't need fancy words or smart arguments, you just need a couple of basic ones that you then develop"".21 The official descriptors demand a ""fully developed position"" with ""fully extended and well supported ideas"".9 The focus is on the
development, extension, and support.
A simple, clear idea that is brilliantly explained and exemplified will always score higher than a complex, philosophical idea that is vague and poorly supported.

### Structuring for Success: The 4-Paragraph Powerhouse

For the time-pressured environment of IELTS, the most efficient and effective structure is the classic 4-paragraph model.13
**Introduction (2-3 sentences):**
* Paraphrase the question statement (do not just copy it, and avoid clunky memorized phrases like ""This is a controversial issue..."").18
* Write a clear thesis statement that directly answers the question and outlines what you will discuss in the essay.13
**Body Paragraphs (The Core of your marks):**
* Each body paragraph must have one central idea. This is non-negotiable.15
* Start with a clear topic sentence that introduces this central idea.18
* Explain the topic sentence. What does it mean? Why is it true?
* Provide a specific, relevant Example to support your explanation. This can be a real-world example or a logical, hypothetical one.1
* You can add a concluding or Link sentence to summarize the paragraph's point or transition to the next.
**Conclusion (1-2 sentences):**
* Briefly summarize your main points from the body paragraphs.
* Restate your thesis/opinion in different words.
* Do not introduce any new ideas.15

### Structural Blueprints for Common Task 2 Essay Types

To help you plan quickly, here are blueprints for the most common essay types.

| Essay Type | Introduction Thesis | Body Paragraph 1 Focus | Body Paragraph 2 Focus | Conclusion Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Opinion (Agree/Disagree) 26** | State your opinion clearly (e.g., ""This essay agrees that..."") and outline your two supporting reasons. | Explain and exemplify your first reason for agreeing/disagreeing. | Explain and exemplify your second reason for agreeing/disagreeing. | Restate your opinion and summarize your two reasons. |
| **Discussion (Discuss Both Views) 26** | Paraphrase the topic and state that you will discuss both viewpoints before giving your own opinion. | Discuss the first viewpoint with explanations and examples. | Discuss the second viewpoint with explanations and examples. | Summarize both views and clearly state your own opinion. |
| **Problem & Solution 26** | Paraphrase the topic and state that you will discuss the main problems and propose viable solutions. | Explain the primary causes/problems associated with the issue, with examples. | Propose and explain the most effective solutions to these problems. | Briefly summarize the problems and the recommended solutions. |
| **Advantages & Disadvantages 26** | Paraphrase the topic and state that you will examine the main advantages and disadvantages. | Discuss one or two key advantages in detail. | Discuss one or two key disadvantages in detail. | Summarize the main pros and cons. If asked, state whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. |

## 2.2 The Opening Act (Task 1): Securing the First Third of Your Marks (20 mins, 150+ words)

While the four marking criteria (CC, LR, GRA) are applied similarly across both modules, the definition of success for Task Achievement (TA) is fundamentally different for Academic and General Training.10
An Academic Task 1 requires the objective, analytical skills of a data reporter.28 A General Training Task 1 requires the pragmatic, social skills of an effective communicator who understands purpose and tone.30

### Academic Module - The Art of the Data Report

Your job is to summarize visual information (graphs, charts, tables, maps, or processes). You are a reporter, not an analyst. You must not give your opinion or speculate on reasons for the data that are not provided.28
**Step 1: Analyze & Plan (3 mins):** Quickly analyze the visual. What do the axes, labels, and units show? What is the time period? Most importantly, identify 2-4 key features. These are the most obvious and significant pieces of information: the highest and lowest points, the most dramatic trends, the biggest changes, or major exceptions to a pattern.5
**Step 2: Write the Introduction & Overview (5 mins):**
* **Introduction (1 sentence):** Paraphrase the question prompt to state what the visual shows.5
* **Overview (2 sentences):** This is the most important paragraph of your report.38 In two sentences, summarize the 2-4 key features you identified in Step 1.
Do not use any specific numbers or data here. This paragraph proves to the examiner that you can see the ""big picture"" before diving into the details.5
**Step 3: Detail the Features in Body Paragraphs (10 mins):** Now, in one or two body paragraphs, you describe those key features in detail, supporting your statements with specific data (numbers, percentages, dates) from the visual.5 Group information logically. For example, if you have two charts, you might dedicate one body paragraph to each.37

### General Training Module - The Perfect Letter

Your job is to write a letter to respond to a situation. You will be given three bullet points that you must cover.
**Step 1: Analyze & Plan (3 mins):**
* **Recipient:** Who are you writing to? A friend? A manager? A company you don't know? This determines the tone.5
* **Purpose:** Why are you writing? To complain? To ask for information? To apologize? This must be clear from the very beginning.
* **Bullet Points:** Identify the three points you must address. You need a plan to cover all of them fully.5
**Step 2: Write the Letter (15 mins):**
* **Opening:** Use the correct salutation based on the tone (e.g., ""Dear John,"" for informal; ""Dear Sir/Madam,"" or ""Dear Mr. Smith,"" for formal). In your first sentence, clearly state the purpose of the letter.30
* **Body Paragraphs:** Clearly and fully address all three bullet points. The easiest way to ensure you do this is to dedicate a separate, short paragraph to each bullet point.5 Make sure you extend each point with sufficient detail.
* **Closing:** Use an appropriate closing line (e.g., ""I look forward to your prompt response."") and sign-off that matches the tone (e.g., ""Best regards,"" for informal/semi-formal; ""Yours sincerely,"" if you used their name, or ""Yours faithfully,"" if you used ""Sir/Madam"").31
Key to Band 9: The tone (formal, semi-formal, or informal) must be perfectly consistent throughout the letter, and all three bullet points must be fully and logically developed.4

# Part 3: The 60-Minute Countdown: A Strategic Game Plan


## 3.1 The 20/40 Time Split: A Non-Negotiable Rule

You must be disciplined with your time. The official advice is to spend approximately 20 minutes on Task 1 and 40 minutes on Task 2.20 This isn't just a suggestion; it's a strategic necessity. Because Task 2 is worth double the marks, spending an extra 5 minutes on Task 1 to make it ""perfect"" is a catastrophic error if it means you run out of time to write a proper conclusion for your essay.20

## 3.2 The First 10 Minutes: Winning the Battle Before You Write

The most critical period of your 60-minute writing test is the initial planning phase. Top-scoring candidates consistently emphasize that planning is the key to success.13 Spending 7-10 minutes planning your essay is not ""wasted time""; it is an investment that pays huge dividends. A good plan leads to a better structure (improving your CC score), more focused arguments (improving your TR score), and faster, more confident writing, which leaves you more time at the end for the crucial proofreading stage.
**Actionable Plan:**
* **Task 2 (First 7-8 minutes of the 40):** Immediately after the test starts, turn to Task 2. Read the question 2-3 times. Identify keywords. Decide your position. Brainstorm two strong supporting points. Jot down a quick 4-paragraph outline with your thesis and topic sentences.18
* **Task 1 (First 2-3 minutes of the 20):** After writing your Task 2 essay, switch to Task 1. Quickly analyze the visual or prompt. Identify your 2-3 key features (Academic) or the purpose/tone (General). Plan your paragraph structure.33

## 3.3 The Final 5-Minute Proofread: Your Last Line of Defense

Proofreading is not optional; it is an essential part of the writing process that can lift your score by catching careless errors.41 But with only a few minutes left, you can't check for everything. You need to perform a
proofreading triage, focusing only on the highest-impact errors. You aren't rewriting your essay; you are polishing it.
**A High-Pressure Proofreading Checklist:**
* **Pass 1: Your Personal Error Scan (60 seconds):** Scan for your most common mistakes. Do you always forget the 's' on third-person verbs? Do you mix up 'its' and 'it's'? Hunt for these specific errors first because you know where to find them.46
* **Pass 2: Subject-Verb Agreement & Tense (60 seconds):** Quickly scan each sentence. Does the subject match the verb? (e.g., ""The government provides,"" not ""The government provide""). Are your tenses consistent?.49
* **Pass 3: Punctuation & Obvious Spelling (60 seconds):** Look for missing full stops. Check for major spelling errors on keywords you've used multiple times. Reading a sentence backwards can sometimes help you spot spelling mistakes because your brain isn't focused on the meaning.43
* **Pass 4: Word Repetition (60 seconds):** Did you use the word ""important"" five times? Quickly scan and see if you can substitute a synonym like ""crucial,"" ""vital,"" or ""significant"" in one or two places.43

# Part 4: Your Personalised Training Regimen & The Final Step


## 4.1 Building Your Arsenal: Beyond the Test Day

A Band 9 performance is built on a foundation of strong language skills developed over time.
**Lexical Resource:** Stop memorizing abstract word lists. You need to learn vocabulary in context. Read high-quality English publications (e.g., The Economist, BBC News, National Geographic) and pay attention to how words are used.2 Keep a vocabulary journal, but don't just write words and definitions. Write down the full sentence you found it in and focus on
collocations for common IELTS topics (e.g., for 'Environment', learn phrases like 'carbon footprint', 'sustainable practices', 'renewable energy').17
**Grammatical Range:** Don't just hope for the best. Be active. Take a simple idea and practice expressing it in multiple ways: as a compound sentence, a complex sentence with a relative clause, a conditional sentence, or using the passive voice where appropriate. This builds the flexibility that examiners look for.36

## 4.2 The Path to Mastery: Practice, Feedback, and Refinement

Simply writing 50 essays will not guarantee a high score. In fact, it might just reinforce your bad habits. The fastest and most effective way to improve is through a targeted feedback loop: Practice -> Get Expert Feedback -> Identify Weaknesses -> Targeted Study -> Practice Again.
You are often blind to your own recurring mistakes. An expert tutor or a reliable, well-designed feedback service can spot patterns in your writing that you will never see on your own (e.g., ""You consistently misuse articles before abstract nouns"").13 This feedback is gold. It allows you to stop making the same mistakes and focus your energy on fixing your specific weak points.54

## 4.3 Final Recommendation: Putting Theory into Practice with Mock Tests

So, you've internalized the marking criteria, you've mastered the task structures, you have a solid time management plan, and you've been building your core skills. What's the final piece of the puzzle?
You have to put it all together under exam conditions. But how do you know if you're truly ready? How can you simulate the pressure and timing of the real 60-minute test and get a feel for the full exam experience?
This is where mock tests become essential. They are the bridge between practice and performance. A full mock test allows you to:
* Test your 20/40 time management strategy under real pressure.
* Practice the mental switch from the analytical Task 1 to the argumentative Task 2.
* Build the writing stamina required for the full 60-minute challenge.
* Get familiar with the test interface, especially for the computer-based exam.

**Understanding Mounjaro Nausea: What's Going On?**

Before we jump into solutions, it helps to understand a little bit about why this nausea happens. Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, works by mimicking natural hormones in your body that help regulate blood sugar and slow down gastric emptying-that's how quickly food moves from your stomach to your intestines. This slower digestion is a big part of why you feel fuller longer and why it helps with weight management. But, it can also lead to a backup, so to speak, in your digestive system, causing that tell-tale nausea.

Think of it like a traffic jam on your internal highway. When things move too slowly, it can cause discomfort. Your body is adjusting to a new rhythm, and sometimes that adjustment period comes with a bit of a tummy protest.

**Immediate Relief: What to Do When Nausea Strikes**

Okay, so you're feeling queasy right now. What can you do in the moment to get some relief? These are my go-to, quick-fix strategies:

**1. Sip, Don't Gulp**

When you're nauseous, the last thing you want is a full stomach. But dehydration can make nausea worse.
* **Small sips:** Don't chug a big glass of water. Instead, take tiny, frequent sips of cool water, clear broths, or electrolyte drinks.
* **Ginger ale (flat is best):** A little ginger can be soothing, and the fizz can sometimes upset an already sensitive stomach. Let it go flat first.
* **Peppermint tea:** Brew a weak cup of peppermint tea. The scent and warmth can be surprisingly comforting.

**2. Mindful Eating (Even If It's Just a Cracker)**

Eating might seem counterintuitive when you're nauseous, but an empty stomach can actually make it worse for some people.
* **Small, bland portions:** Think of ""BRAT"" foods: **B**ananas, **R**ice, **A**pplesauce, **T**oast. These are easy on the stomach.
* **Avoid trigger foods:** Stay away from anything greasy, spicy, or high in fat when you're feeling sick. These will only exacerbate the issue.
* **Eat slowly:** Give your body time to process. Don't rush through even a small snack.

**3. Cool Down and Rest**

Sometimes, all your body needs is a little calm.
* **Fresh air:** Step outside for a few minutes if you can, or open a window.
* **Cool compress:** Place a cool, damp cloth on your forehead or the back of your neck. It can be surprisingly effective at distracting from the nausea.
* **Lie down:** If possible, rest in a comfortable position. Sometimes lying down can help settle your stomach.

**Proactive Steps: Preventing Nausea Before It Starts**

While immediate relief is great, the real game-changer is preventing nausea from becoming a regular occurrence. Here's what I've learned about being proactive:

**1. Strategic Shot Timing**

This was a big one for me. When you take your shot can make a difference.
* **Evening shots:** Many people find that taking their Mounjaro shot in the evening, right before bed, helps. This way, any initial nausea might happen while you're asleep.
* **Weekend shots:** If you have a flexible schedule, consider taking your shot on a Friday evening. That gives you the weekend to adjust if you experience stronger side effects.

**2. Optimize Your Diet and Hydration**

What and how you eat (and drink!) plays a crucial role.
* **Prioritize protein:** Aim for lean proteins at every meal. Protein helps you feel full and can be easier to digest than heavy fats or sugars.
* **Go low-fat:** Fatty foods are harder for your body to process, especially with slower gastric emptying. Stick to lean meats, vegetables, and whole grains.
* **Stay hydrated, constantly:** This isn't just about sipping when you're nauseous. Make hydration a daily habit. Water, unsweetened tea, and dilute electrolyte drinks are your friends.
* **Small, frequent meals:** Instead of three big meals, try five or six smaller ones throughout the day. This keeps your digestive system working gently without overloading it.

**3. Listen to Your Body**

This might sound obvious, but it's incredibly important.
* **Don't force food:** If you're not hungry, don't eat. Mounjaro significantly reduces appetite, and forcing yourself to eat when you're not hungry can trigger nausea.
* **Identify trigger foods:** Pay attention to what foods or drinks seem to make your nausea worse. For some, it's coffee, for others, it's sugary snacks. Keep a mental note (or a real one!) of these culprits.
* **Adjust dosage timing with your doctor:** If nausea is persistent and debilitating, talk to your doctor. They might suggest adjusting your dose or exploring other options.

**When to Talk to Your Doctor**

While nausea is common, severe or persistent nausea, especially when accompanied by other symptoms, warrants a call to your healthcare provider. Don't hesitate to reach out if you experience:
* **Severe vomiting** that prevents you from keeping liquids down.
* **Signs of dehydration** like dizziness, decreased urination, or extreme thirst.
* **Abdominal pain** that is severe or doesn't go away.
* **Nausea that doesn't improve** with the strategies mentioned here.

Your doctor can offer personalized advice, adjust your medication, or rule out other issues. Remember, they're your partner in this journey!

**You've Got This!**

Dealing with Mounjaro nausea can be frustrating, I know. It can make you feel like you're fighting an uphill battle, especially when you're trying to make positive changes for your health. But what I've learned is that with a little patience, some smart strategies, and a willingness to experiment, you *can* manage it.

By being proactive with your diet, timing your shots wisely, and having a few immediate relief tricks up your sleeve, you can significantly reduce the impact of nausea on your daily life. Remember to listen to your body, be kind to yourself, and don't be afraid to reach out to your doctor if you need extra support. You're on an incredible journey, and tackling these bumps in the road is just part of building a healthier, happier you.",1,1751389284.0,MounjaroWiki,0,1.0,False

*For nearly a week, immigration agents in Buffalo have targeted a block on the city’s West Side, seeking to detain an Iranian man living there.*

*The man is in the United States legally. He has no criminal history, no warrant for his arrest and regularly checks in with immigration officials as part of his asylum case. He’s seeking to stay in the country permanently with his son after having fled persecution in Iran for his political activity.*

*Since Wednesday, agents believed to be with Immigration and Customs Enforcement have staked out Greenwood Place in unmarked vehicles seeking to arrest him should he set foot on the sidewalk or other public property.* 

*“I’ve been having a lot of stress,” the Iranian man said in an interview. Investigative Post is not naming him because he and his attorney fear seizure by federal agents.*

*His neighbors aren’t having it.* 

*More than a dozen have organized themselves into rotating shifts to keep watch on the ICE agents.*

*“You picked the wrong block,” said Jennifer Connor, one of the residents keeping watch.*

*Lawmakers representing the neighborhood are also denouncing the apparent ICE stakeout.*

*“We will not stand for this disgraceful behavior in the City of Good Neighbors,” state Sen. April Baskin said in a statement.*

*“ICE is out of control,” added state Sen. Sean Ryan, who last week won the Democratic primary for Buffalo mayor.*

*Other local officials, including Assemblyman Jonathan Rivera, Common Council Majority Leader Leah Halton-Pope and Buffalo Board of Eduction member Jennifer Mecozzi also issued statements denouncing the ICE activity. Halton-Pope called the stakeout “unconstitutional” and “un-American.”*

*“What is happening in this neighborhood is not about public safety. It is the weaponization of immigration enforcement against people who pose no threat,” she said in her statement. “That \[Iranians\] are being targeted at all — let alone amid rising global tensions involving Iran — speaks to a shameful and dangerous agenda.”*

*On Saturday agents in unmarked cars parked for hours along the block, which is close to Grant Street and West Delavan Avenue. None exited their vehicles, knocked on his door or introduced themselves to neighbors, who stood by watching.*

*That day, an Investigative Post reporter witnessed one agent, wearing a bulletproof vest that said “Police ICE” on the front, sitting in an idling Dodge Grand Caravan. Residents that day reported seeing other agents in a gray Nissan SUV and a black Hyundai SUV.* 

*Residents of Greenwood Place have rallied behind the Iranian family, organizing the neighborhood to keep watch on the ICE agents.*

*On Saturday, neighbors organized an impromptu “garden party” at a local community garden where some plucked weeds, others sipped coffee and chatted and all kept eyes on the officers nearby. On Monday, some neighbors sold lemonade, others worked on laptops on their porches and others kept watch for ICE agents.*

*“We are definitely keeping an eye out. We know our rights,” said Connor. “We’re looking out for these unmarked agents who don’t identify themselves.”*

*The response is due, in part, to multiple community organizers living in the neighborhood including Connor, the executive director of Justice for Migrant Families. She said she heard about the stakeouts through her work and from neighbors, and said she knows the family personally. Her kids play soccer and basketball with the Iranian child, doing art projects and racing bicycles up and down the block.*

*Niagara Common Council Member David Rivera, whose district  includes Greenwood Place, said he was alarmed by the situation. He said the residents who called his office have every right to be concerned.*

*“I don’t know if there are sex offenders in that car. I don’t know if there’s someone looking at kids while they’re up and down the street,” he said. “I don’t know why they’re there.”*

*Rivera said he contacted Rep. Tim Kennedy’s office to alert him to the ICE stakeout. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.*

*“The residents have every right to peer into the car, take down their license plates, because they don’t know who they are,” said Rivera, a retired Buffalo police detective.*

*An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.*

*The targeting of the Iranian family follows U.S. military strikes on Iran June 21. In the wake of the attack on that country’s nuclear facilities, immigration agents in New York and across the country have begun detaining Iranian families, seeking to deport both alleged criminals and those living in the country without legal status.*

*“The targeting of Iranian people has been different since this new administration,” said Natalie Lesniak, a legal representative for immigrants with the Erie County Bar Association’s Volunteer Lawyers Project.*

*“Having no criminal background and a pending asylum case, or any kind of case, you wouldn’t fear ICE coming and watching as much as you do as you do now,” she added. “This is not how it used to be.”*

*Rivera said the Trump administration’s crackdown on migrants has been jarring: City officials are working to welcome migrants to the city while the federal government is seeking to remove them.*

*“It’s creating problems in neighborhoods, it’s creating problems in businesses, it’s creating problems in houses of worship. People are even scared to go to church because they’re afraid of being followed to church,” he said.*

*The West Side Iranian man said he would like to find work as a bus driver or chef, but has faced a long wait for a work permit. In the meantime, he and his family have stayed with a host, sharing the West Side home. He said he spends his days learning English — in part by reading Harry Potter and Dr. Seuss books — and walking the host’s dog, Tesla.*

*“Most of the time I’m standing at the door making sure that the ICE is not coming,” he said.*

*The man said he was involved in protests against the Iranian government and fled the country after being imprisoned. Iran in late 2022 and early 2023 experienced an uprising, marked by public demonstrations, boycotts and a general strike, set off by the death of a woman who was jailed for not wearing a hijab properly. The government ultimately put down the protests with force, resulting in hundreds killed and thousands jailed.*

*Before he escaped, the man said he lost his job and was “tortured” by the government. Should ICE deport him, he said, Iranian officials will “either execute me or they’ll put me in jail for 30 years,” he said.*

*He came to the United States “because of the freedom, because of the people,” he said.*

*“The United States is a land of dreams and hopes,” he said. “I tell myself that God will help us and everything will be okay.”*",136,1751389242.0,Buffalo,43,0.92,False

**About the Instructor**  
Shardaé seeks to hold space for you, the modern yogi, to be and to breathe in unity with yourself and others.

Her teachings are rooted in the traditions of yoga, so classes tend to begin with pranayama, mantra, or meditation before mindfully moving into an embodied breath-led asana practice.

Throughout the practice, each inhalation and exhalation is an invitation to journey through your inner world with curiosity, compassion and courage. You will be encouraged to honour breath and body always, and to embrace strength in effort and softness in ease accordingly.",1,1751389114.0,London_Events,0,1.0,False

* ha te egy random fiatal vagy 1 millió Ft „vagyonnal”, akkor 141 Ft-ot (2 császárzsömle!) kell felajánlanod a rászorulóknak, hogy legalább annyira gáláns legyél, mint Andiék;
* ha már összekuporgattál valamennyit, haladsz az életben, de még nincs lakásod, (legyen mondjuk 10 millió Ft vagyonod), akkor combos 1 406 Ft-ot kell felajánlanod, és megtetted a te részed;

From 1 to 3pm it rained, and not wanting to overwater (something that has repeatedly been a problem expressed by her.

1lp6smt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lp6smt/should_you_try_the_best_single_serve_espresso/,Should You Try the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine Illy Y3.3,"Testing the Illy 60472 espresso machine in my kitchen over the past few weeks has been quite the adventure. As someone who loves their morning espresso, I was intrigued by its compact design and programmable features. While I’m generally satisfied with its performance, there are subtle quirks worth mentioning. Here's my honest take on this single-serve coffee maker and how it stacked up against my expectations.

**Design and Build**  
The sleek and modern black finish of this espresso machine immediately adds a touch of sophistication to any kitchen counter. Measuring just 11.73""D x 6.69""W x 14.96""H, its compact nature makes it incredibly space-efficient. It fits snugly between my toaster and the blender without feeling cramped. I appreciate this because my kitchen isn’t exactly spacious. The buttons on the front are simple to use and pretty intuitive—perfect for a coffee enthusiast who doesn’t feel like playing tech support before their first cup of the day. However, the casing, while attractive, does feel a bit plasticky, which makes me wonder about the long-term durability.  

**Ease of Use and Programmability**  
This coffee maker is a dream for anyone who prioritizes convenience. Thanks to the two programmable settings, I can easily switch between preparing an espresso or a drip coffee with the push of a button. My partner, who generally avoids fiddling with tech-heavy appliances, had no issue using it either. It’s also fully automatic, so once you press a button, your work is done. I found setting up the machine relatively straightforward. However, it did take a bit of trial and error to figure out the ideal cup size settings for my favorite mugs.  

**Quick Brewing Performance**  
One standout feature for me is the fast heating system. It reaches an optimal brewing temperature in under a minute, which is a lifesaver during rushed weekday mornings. It’s a stark contrast to my previous machine, which made me wait what felt like an eternity. There’s minimal downtime, allowing me to enjoy a hot espresso without glancing at the clock anxiously. However, the brewing process is just a tad noisy. It’s not unbearable, but if you’re brewing early in the morning in a quiet home, you’ll notice it.  

**Key Advantages**  
- Creates espresso or drip coffee quickly with programmable buttons.  
- Compact footprint fits well in tighter kitchens or office spaces.  
- Minimal setup required, with user-friendly control buttons.  
- Fast heating system ensures your brew is ready in less than a minute.

**Patented Capsules for the Coffee-Lover**  
One thing that sets this product apart is its reliance on illy’s proprietary iperEspresso capsules. These capsules are designed to deliver consistent flavor and a rich, long-lasting crema. Having tested it multiple times, I can attest to the consistently smooth and bold flavor profile they deliver. However, the limitation here is the exclusivity of the capsules. If you’re someone like me who likes experimenting with various brands, you’re stuck with using only illy’s capsules. They’re great quality, but I did find myself missing the flexibility to switch things up.  

**Compactness vs. Capacity**  
Its small footprint is both a blessing and a mild limitation. While it’s ideal for small spaces, the water reservoir feels a bit too compact. I’m refilling it more often than I would like, especially when making more than one cup of coffee. This isn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s worth considering if multiple people in your household use the machine daily.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited to using illy’s iperEspresso capsules, restricting variety.  
- Can be slightly noisy while brewing.  
- Compact water tank requires frequent refills.  

**Product Rivals**  
When comparing this espresso machine to alternatives, the Nespresso Essenza Mini comes to mind. It’s equally compact and user-friendly but offers broader compatibility with pods from different brands. However, the Essenza Mini doesn’t deliver the same rich crema that the iperEspresso capsules produce. On the other hand, machines like the Keurig K-Supreme Plus provide more brewing options, including compatibility with ground coffee, but they are bulkier and take up more counter space. If you value simplicity, sleekness, and authentic espresso taste, Illy’s machine definitely holds its own.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its price bracket, this espresso maker offers a fair balance of quality and practicality. The programmable features, sleek design, and consistent coffee experience make it a worthwhile consideration. While the exclusive capsules do add to the running costs, the output quality justifies the expense for coffee purists. That said, if you’d like a more budget-friendly option, you might need to explore machines with broader compatibility.

This single-serve coffee maker feels like it was custom-made for anyone who prioritizes simplicity and efficiency without sacrificing choice. Its compact design and flexibility to brew both coffee pods and ground coffee made it an instant standout in my kitchen. Whether I’m flying out the door or savoring a lazy Sunday morning, this machine does the job with surprising ease.

**Streamlined Design That Saves Space**  
My countertops are always crammed, and having a device as compact as this coffee maker was a game-changer. It measures 6.41 by 12.51 by 12 inches and fits snuggly next to my toaster, leaving me with ample space for meal prep. The matte finish in the chic Oatmilk color adds a modern touch, blending well with other appliances. Its lightweight nature also makes it easy to shift around when needed. Personally, I found the cord-tie feature incredibly handy, as it kept everything neat and minimized tangles.

**Customizable Coffee Options**  
If there’s one thing I value in a coffee maker, it’s flexibility. The BELLA single-serve coffee maker caters to just about any coffee drinker. I lean towards freshly ground coffee on weekends and coffee pods on busier days, and this machine accommodates both seamlessly. The inclusion of a reusable coffee filter and coffee pod adapter emphasizes its versatility. Brewing cups ranging from 6oz to 14oz tailored perfectly to my varying caffeine needs was honestly a lifesaver. Large travel mugs fit just fine when the adjustable drip tray is moved to its lowest setting—a feature I often use during my rushed mornings.  

[Ready to buy BELLA 35126-043A? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0cyj6xt9s/)

**Ease of Use And Features**  
Operating this coffee maker could not get any easier. It features an intuitive one-touch brewing system that’ll work even before I’ve had my caffeine fix. The automatic shut-off function provided peace of mind on countless occasions when I rushed out, entirely forgetting to turn it off. The dishwasher-safe components, including the drip tray, coffee pod adapter, and reusable filter, speed up cleanup, a factor I greatly appreciate. I didn’t have to spend forever scrubbing stubborn residues away—just toss in the parts and get on with my day.  

**Good Points**  
- Compact and stylish design  
- Supports coffee pods and freshly ground coffee  
- Adjustable drip tray accommodates tall travel mugs  
- Offers brewing size options between 6oz to 14oz  
- Auto shut-off and dishwasher-safe components for user convenience  

**Bad Points**  
- The water reservoir only holds 14 ounces, which may require frequent refilling on days with multiple cups  
- Brewing can be slightly noisy, though not unbearably so  
- A more durable build might make it feel sturdier over the long term  

**Rival Brands**  
When comparing this coffee maker to similar options like the Keurig K-Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the BELLA model punches above its weight in terms of space efficiency and design. It lacks a larger water reservoir, which both competing options provide, but wins on affordability and ease of cleaning. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew also supports ground coffee and pods, yet it feels notably bulkier on small countertops. Keurig K-Mini’s brewing process is faster, but the BELLA machine’s reusable filter makes it a more eco-friendly pick. The biggest plus for me is its consistent performance without overly complicating the process.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For anyone seeking a balance between performance and affordability, this little coffee maker justifies its price tag. Unlike higher-end machines, which cost an arm and a leg but include features I rarely use, the BELLA 35126-043A focuses on what users need daily. Reliable, customizable brewing without overloading with unnecessary bells and whistles ensures you’re getting true value here.

Also, about the extra table and chairs they include: they look huge and clunky. I’m honestly fine eating at my desk like I did last year—can they be removed or repositioned easily?

👉 **Many businesses don’t consistently reply to Google reviews.** Not because they don’t care, but because it’s time-consuming, repetitive, and easy to forget when running day-to-day operations.

So I developed an **AI-powered automation tool** that:  
✅ Reads and analyzes each Google review (positive or negative)  
✅ Generates personalized, context-aware replies (no generic templates)  
✅ Posts them automatically to your Google Business profile  
✅ Logs every reply in a private dashboard for transparency

🎯 **Zero manual work. No apps to install. Fully background automation.**

This not only saves hours but also improves customer retention, increases local SEO rankings, and builds stronger brand trust — all for less than a cup of coffee a week

Right now, I’m offering walkthroughs for anyone curious about how it works — happy to demo it using your real Google reviews.

👉 **I’d love to get your feedback — whether you think this is valuable, suggestions to improve, or even brutal critiques.**

If you’re a business owner, marketer, or just automation-curious, let me know what you think!

Thanks,

Scam or just full of himself?,"Met this guy on Seeking (not even a premium member btw — still not sure how he messaged me more than 10 times). What really got me was how fast he tried to jump to a meetup. His second message, literally right after “Hi XX,” was:

“Are you interested in a 5 min in-person meet and greet? We can grab matcha/coffee/juice.”

I’d already shared that I’m in looking for a mutually supportive arrangement — meaning tuition or rent help as part of the connection. He asked, “How much are you looking for?” so I gave a rough estimate based on half the rent of a 1b in SF per meet.

To keep it safe, I suggested having a quick call through Telegram and provided my availability in the morning (since Seeking can be weird about discussing allowance details), and said we could hop on a quick call — nothing intense, just to make sure we’re on the same page.

He added me, when I told him that feel free to call me whenever he’s ready but he then goes, “I’m busy all morning for a call, but I’m interested to meet you. What times are you free?”

Wait… you don’t want to talk, but you want to meet up? You asked about allowance but now don’t want to clarify anything over the phone?

Like… what’s the point of me wasting my time getting ready and going somewhere to meet a guy who refuses to have even one real conversation?

And if you didn’t want to talk, why not just say that on Seeking instead of adding me on Telegram? Why even take it off-platform just to ghost a 2-min call? I don’t know where the audacity comes from — it gave me serious “either a scam or he thinks he’s God’s gift” energy.

Anyone else getting weird low-effort meetup pushes like this? Scammy vibe or just another dude wanting free attention?",0,1751387917.0,sugarlifestyleforum,8,0.5,False

# Harold McGee

* Dr. Harold McGee is a professor at Stanford University and a world-renowned author on the topic of science and the chemistry of food and cooking

* He has spent more than four decades researching and writing about this topic, teaching us about why foods taste the way they do and how to make them taste better

* The discussion covers various topics, including the preparation of meat, the umami taste, and the chemistry of food and cooking

# Food Chemistry, Using Copper, Modern vs Traditional Techniques

* Copper bowls are used to whip egg whites, as they help to create a better foam and texture, and this technique has been used by French cooks for hundreds of years

* Copper is also used in jam making and jelly making, as it inhibits the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose, resulting in a better flavor and texture

* Traditional cooking techniques, developed through experimentation and unconscious genius, are sometimes more effective than modern scientific approaches

# Cooking, Food & Heat, Taste & Smell

* The application of heat to food breaks down large molecules into smaller ones that can be detected by the senses of taste and smell, making food more enjoyable

* Cooking takes macroolecules like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, and breaks them down into smaller molecules that can stimulate the senses of taste and smell

* The use of heat in food preparation has a history that dates back to the use of fire, which not only increased caloric intake but also made food more delicious

# Chemistry of Taste

* When meat is cooked, the heat breaks down large molecules into smaller, reactive pieces that can stimulate taste receptors, resulting in a more complex flavor profile

* The cooking process generates volatile molecules that are detected by the nose and smaller molecules that stimulate taste receptors, including sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and umami

* The transformation of molecules through heat can create new flavor compounds that stimulate the sweet receptors, even if the original molecules did not

# Umami, Savory Tastes, Braising & Meat

* Umami is a sensation that gives us the feeling of savoriness, and it is often associated with the intense flavor of braised meat

* The intensity of flavor per unit of braised meat is very high, but the flavor can change over time, becoming less pleasant if left for a few hours

* Umami was initially discovered by Japanese scientists, who were the first to molecularly clone the umami receptor and propose it as a basic taste sensation

# The Discovery of Umami

* The existence of umami as a basic taste was initially met with skepticism in the West, but was later proven to be correct with the discovery of a receptor for glutamate in the 2000s

* Umami is a sensation that is difficult to describe, but it is often characterized as a feeling of fullness and length, with a flavor that sticks with you for a while

* The sensation of umami is not restricted to the mouth, but can spread throughout the body, and may be closely tied to the reward pathways associated with consuming protein

# Chemistry of Cooking & Eating, Sugars & Conjugates; Slowly Enjoying Food

* The Maillard reactions occur when meat is cooked to a high temperature, resulting in a color change and the formation of new compounds, including sugars

* These reactions generate a variety of products, including conjugates, which are molecules composed of a business end and a sugar, and can be broken down by enzymes in the mouth

* The breakdown of conjugates can release aromatic molecules, contributing to the dynamic experience of eating and the development of flavors in the mouth

# Enjoying Food Slowly

* Slowly enjoying food can lead to a richer experience, as the breakdown of conjugates and the release of new flavors can occur over time

* Taking pauses between bites and allowing residues to remain in the mouth can enhance the experience, as the leftovers can be as delicious as the main course

* Slowing down the rate of eating can also improve digestion and allow for a more dynamic experience of taste and flavor

# Savory Meal & Dessert; Food Course Order; Palate Cleansers

* Many people eat dinner just to get to dessert, but some prefer not to have dessert immediately after a big meal

* The order of food in a meal can affect digestion and the ability to taste flavors, with some cultures eating soup first, then an appetizer, and salad last

* The French way of sequencing dishes in a meal, with soup first and salad last, may make sense in terms of digestion and sensory experience

# Salt, Baseline & Shifting Taste Preferences

* Taste preferences can shift over time, with repeated exposure to certain flavors changing an individual's threshold for what is considered too sweet or too bitter

* The brain can adapt to new levels of stimulation, making what was once considered too bitter or too sweet become the new normal

* It is possible to train oneself to adjust taste preferences, but it takes time, as shown by studies on reducing sodium content in packaged goods

# Whole vs Processed Foods, Taste & Enjoyment

* Eating foods closer to their natural form may provide a richer taste experience than consuming processed foods with combined flavors

* Processed foods can overwhelm the senses with an immediate hit of flavor, but may lack the nuances and appreciation of individual ingredients

* Savoring natural ingredients like strawberries and blueberries can provide a more enjoyable eating experience than consuming them in processed forms

# Brewing Coffee, Water Temperature, Grind Size

* The freshness of coffee beans and the method of brewing can affect the taste, with factors such as grind size and water temperature playing a crucial role

* The Aeropress is an interesting brewing method that combines elements of French press and filter drip, allowing for more control over the flavor

* The temperature of the water used for brewing coffee can significantly impact the flavor, with boiling water producing a different taste than water that is just below boiling point

# Coffee Chemistry

* The grind size of coffee beans makes a huge difference in the brewing process, as it affects the extraction of soluble materials from the beans

* The longer coffee beans are exposed to hot water, the more large molecules are extracted, resulting in a bitter and astringent taste

* Experimenting with different brewing times and temperatures can help coffee lovers understand how these factors impact the flavor of their coffee

# Tea & Tannins, Growing Tea Plants; Tea & Meals, Polyphenols

* Tea plants can be grown at home, and the new growth is used to make tea, with the type of tea depending on the processing techniques used

* The tannic flavor in tea can be smooth or metallic, depending on the treatment of the tea leaves and the molecules present

* Polyphenols in tea can cross-link proteins, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, and they may even have health benefits

# Food Combinations, Individual Tolerance; Is there an Optimal Diet?

* There is no one-size-fits-all answer to food combinations, and individual tolerance plays a significant role in determining what foods can be consumed together

* Some people may experience digestive issues with certain food combinations, but this is highly dependent on individual physiology

* There is no optimal diet, and the best approach may be to try a variety of foods and find what works for each person

# Onions & Garlic, Histamines, Tool: Reduce Crying when Cutting Onions

* Onions and garlic belong to the Allium family and defend themselves with sulfur molecules that can cause irritation and crying when their tissues are disrupted

* The volatile molecules released by onions can be mitigated by wearing goggles, rinsing the cut surfaces with water, or using non-pungent varieties of onions

* Histamines in onions can cause gut issues and inflammation in some individuals, highlighting the importance of considering food sensitivities

# Gut Sensitivities & Food, Capsaicin & Spicy Foods

* Capsaicin in spicy foods is designed to be aversive to mammals, but not birds, which are responsible for dispersing the seeds

* People's sensitivity to capsaicin and other spicy compounds can vary greatly, with some able to handle high levels and others being very sensitive

* The relationship between food chemistry, individual experience, and medicine is complex, and recognizing the role of chemicals in food can help explain people's negative reactions

# Supertasters & Taste Buds, Bitter Taste, Chefs

* Research has identified ""supertasters"" who have a higher density of taste receptors on their tongues, making them more sensitive to certain tastes, particularly bitterness and acidity

* Supertasters may not necessarily have better taste discrimination, but rather a heightened sensitivity to certain flavors, which can be overwhelming

* Chefs who are supertasters may struggle to match the flavor preferences of their customers, as they may perceive certain flavors as too intense

# Salt & Bitter, Salting Fruit, Beer or Coffee, Warming Beer

* Salting fruit can diminish the sensation of bitterness by increasing the salt content, making it less bitter without adding sugar

* Some people add a tiny bit of salt to their coffee to reduce bitterness, based on the chemistry of bitter and salty tastes

* Heating beer to room temperature can change its taste, making it sweeter and more enjoyable for some people

# Human History of Alcohol & Chocolate

* Humans have been enjoying alcohol since before they were homo sapiens, with evidence of fermentation found in archaeological sites

* The history of alcohol consumption dates back to the beginnings of agriculture, with evidence found in various places such as China and the Middle East

* Chocolate was likely discovered through the fermentation of cacao seeds, which were thrown in a pile near a fire and fermented with fruit residues

# Wine Expense vs Taste, Wine Knowledge

* Alcohol has a long history, and the wine industry is huge, with many factors influencing the taste of wine, including weather, soil, and grape variety

* Blind taste tests have shown that even experienced wine drinkers may not be able to discern the difference between expensive and inexpensive wines

* The perception of wine taste is influenced by expectations, and people's conclusions about a wine's quality can be affected by their imperfect nature as sensory beings

# Introduction to Wine Variation

* The variation in wines from different makers, locations, and weather conditions can be noticed with training, similar to appreciating art or other complex subjects

* Knowing more about a particular wine can help appreciate or depreciate its quality, and wine is a fascinating material with many distinctions to explore

* The appreciation of wine depends on the consumer's curiosity and interest in the nuances of different wines

# Cheese Making, Aged Cheese & Crystals, Tyrosine

* Cheese has been made and consumed by humans for around 7,000 to 8,000 years, originating in central Asia, with its diversity of flavors being a tribute to human ingenuity

* The chemistry of cheese is more interesting than milk due to the breakdown of proteins and fats by microbes over weeks, months, or years, generating small molecules with flavor

* Aged cheeses like Parmesan have crystals that are usually tyrosine or other amino acid derivatives, which are a sign of authenticity and the aging process

# Smoke Flavors, Distilling

* Smoke flavors in cheese are added through an actual smoking process, which was originally used to ward off bugs and other pests

* Smoke flavors can also be found in distilled beverages like bourbon, but this is a cultural preference rather than a necessary step in the production process

* The smokiness in barrels for distilled beverages comes from the heating process used to make the wood pliable, and its incorporation into the flavor is a matter of taste and skill

# Fermentation, “Stink Fish”, Caviar, Traditional & New Foods

* Consuming low sugar fermented foods daily can lower inflammation markers, and fermentation has been discovered by every population on earth, including the Inuit who prize ""stink fish""

* Fermentation can be used to create various foods, such as caviar, which is highly prized for its omega-3 content and micronutrients

* The sharing of expertise and knowledge has led to the creation of new foods, such as miso made with peas, and has transformed traditional food materials through the action of microbes

# Personal Journey, Astronomy, Poetry & Food

* The journey into food science and chemistry began with a background in astronomy and a shift to literature, with a degree in the poetry of John Keats

* The interest in food science was sparked by conversations with friends and exploring why certain foods, such as beans, have specific effects on the body

* A book about the science of food was written after a publisher expressed interest, and this marked the beginning of a career in food science and chemistry

# Beans & Gas, Tool: Soaking Beans

* Soaking beans in water can remove some of the gas-producing molecules, as discovered by NASA scientists, who found that beans contain carbohydrates that the body cannot break down, leading to gas production by microbes in the gut

* The process of soaking and boiling beans can leach out these molecules, reducing gas production, and the gut microbiome can adapt to tolerate these foods over time

* Regular consumption of beans and other gas-producing foods can lead to increased tolerance, as the gut microbiome adapts to break down the complex carbohydrates

# Gut Microbiome, Fermented Foods; Kids & Food Aversions

* The gut microbiome plays a key role in food tolerance and adaptation, with fermented foods like kimchi being beneficial for the microbiome

* Kids have a heightened sense of taste and smell, which can lead to food aversions, but these aversions can be temporary and adaptable with repeated exposure to the food

* Allowing kids to eat as much or as little of a particular food as they want can help them develop a tolerance for it, and some foods may be more easily tolerated than others

# Cilantro & Divergent Tastes; Microwave Popcorn, Parmesan Cheese

* Cilantro can taste different to different people due to the presence of molecules that are also found in soaps, which can be influenced by cultural and environmental factors

* Some people may experience a strong dislike for cilantro due to its soap-like taste, while others may enjoy it, highlighting the complex relationship between taste, smell, and cultural background

* Other foods like microwave popcorn and parmesan cheese can also elicit divergent reactions due to their unique flavor components, such as butyric acid in parmesan cheese, which can be perceived as vomit-like by some people

# John Keats Poetry, To Autumn; Acknowledgements

* Keats started out as a medical student at Guys Hospital in London and had personal experiences with death, including the loss of his mother and brother to TB, which influenced his poetry

* The poem ""To Autumn"" is a description of a natural scene in autumn, but knowing Keats' personal experiences adds a dimension of appreciation to the poem

* Keats wrote poetry to comfort people and to work through what life is all about, and to come to terms with his own life experiences",2,1751387826.0,HubermanLab,1,1.0,False

1lp6bdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1lp6bdt/curious_on_the_outcome_of_this_case_has_anyone/,Curious on the outcome of this case. Has anyone had a similar issue? [USA],"Hello all, this is a pretty long post. (I'll have a TLDR at the end.) I just want some insight on this situation. I've never had to open a case with Airbnb before and just wanted to see if anyone else has had a similar scenario happen to them and what ultimately came out of it. My case manager won't be in until this Thursday, so in the meantime I wanted to see some opinions/thoughts here. 

I recently had a stay at an Airbnb with my partner for his birthday, stay was 3 nights, Friday through Monday. The listing was new without reviews, but I've stayed at another listing with the same host a few years ago, and felt as though the host was wonderful and their properties were amazing. 

But at this new apartment, our experience was lackluster and the host seemed very disorganized, ultimately leading to a case being opened. 

Background:

We checked in on Friday, I messaged the host with a slew of questions regarding the listing, since it was new and the description of everything was bare bones. I asked questions about amenities and what's available in the apartment, parking, check-in/out times, when the access code will be sent, etc. Following up with, if they had any information they would like us to know, they are free to divulge. We recieved a response that said:

""Yes to everything. Check in is at 4pm."" 

Already, this should've been a flag that the attentiveness was lacking from the host, not all of my questions were ""yes or no"" answers. An hour before check in, I message them asking for the check in instructions for when we arrive. They send them, just stating the access code to get into the building. We get to the apartment, and due to no formal check in instructions being sent, besides when I asked, we didn't have the wifi name or password. I message them an hour after check in, asking for the wifi, no response. I message them TWO HOURS after my first message, stating that I need the wifi for work purposes, no response. I wait 20 minutes and then contact Airbnb support, seeing if they can get in touch with the host. Airbnb support can't get in contact with them either. Airbnb offers 30% refund per night that the issue persists. 

In the meantime, we wait, decide to turn on the TV to see if the TVs are connected to the wifi. We then get a prompt saying ""Your bill is past due and your service has been suspended."" So the host hasn't paid for their internet bill. We send the photos to Airbnb, they continue to try and contact the host. 

Out of nowhere at around 9PM the same day, we get a knock on the door. We reluctantly open the door to find a man with a bag full of tools, stating he's replacing the batteries in the lock to the front door. There were no messages sent prior in regards to the lock or anyone showing up to fix it. He also states that they're ""working on the wifi."", so we allow him to fix the lock, ultimately questioning the safety of the lock prior to him arriving. He leaves. We still wait. At 11pm, they send the password and name to the wifi. Despite the rough start, we decide to overlook the issue and attempt to enjoy the rest of our stay. 

The listing did not have facial towels, dish soap/dishwasher pods/liquid, all canisters of sugar and coffee were empty, they provided a half used roll of paper towel that they stamped to appear new, and a half used roll of toilet paper with one other full one. 

But once again, we overlooked these issues due to bringing our own essentials.

Sunday, at around noon, my partner is getting the dishes clean, and we hear beeps at the door, as if someone is pressing buttons on the lock, we just assume that someone had the wrong door, since the apartment is clustered with other units outside. But the door opens and a woman comes in. She states that she's the cleaning lady. We tell her that she's not supposed to be here. She says that she speaks no English. So she's standing here, about to walk around as if she's about to clean, my partner does hand motions and signals saying that ""we're good."" and she still doesn't understand. I pull out Google translate, attempting to tell her that we don't check out until tomorrow. She still doesn't understand. She then stands with my phone, speaking into Google translate for around 5 minutes, before my partner puts into the phone ""We checkout Monday, not Sunday."". She says sorry and leaves. 

I immediately contact support again. Stating that someone entered without knocking, no prior messages, or announcement. Support opens a safety case and I immediately get a call from the host. I ignore the call from the host, while being on the phone with Airbnb support. The host sends me a message saying:

""Sorry, I mixed up the schedule, thought you were checking out today."" 

I don't respond to the message. Airbnb support continues to say that they'll open a case and asked me a slew of questions regarding what happened. I explain, but the case manager was about to leave and wouldn't be back until a certain day, so they couldn't get back to me about my responses, they just found someone in the meantime to say that if I have any other concerns I can tell the new person in the chat. They ask if I'd like to leave, despite check out being the next morning and that they'd reimburse if I get another hotel room or book another Airbnb. I felt as though since checkout being not even 24 hours away, there was no reason to just up and leave immediately, and that due to financial reasons that wouldn't be ideal anyways. They say okay. 

Once again, we attempt to try and enjoy the rest of our stay. We somewhat laughed about the situation, we both have tough skin, and stuff like this isn't too startling (We're from Baltimore if that makes the situation any funnier.), but my partner could see the absolute anger on my face while it was happening. 

So, the case manager won't be able to respond to me until Thursday. I asked them what is meant to come of this situation and what they meant by ""starting a review on your host account."". They stated that it's an internal process and they can't divulge that information to me. So now I wait. 

If anyone could please share an experience or any information about Airbnb support and investigations, please let me know and thank you for your response. 

Is a refund likely for the situation, partial refund? What happens to the host since it's against Airbnb's rules to enter a private area while rented? 

(TL;DR - Stay with host was lackluster, lacked amenities and essentials, had to get Airbnb support involved for unpaid wifi bill. Had two unannounced popups from ""staff"", one resulting in the cleaning lady entering without notice while we were present in the Airbnb. Now waiting on Airbnb support to run investigation on Thursday.) ",2,1751387552.0,AirBnB,2,1.0,False

This Margiela tee is peak minimalist cool. The upside-down logo? So subtle, people stare trying to figure it out.

I know you probably won’t see this anymore, but I still wanted to say something. I’m doing okay. Actually, I’m doing pretty well.

Life without you is quiet. It’s peaceful in a way that almost feels familiar. Kind of like how it was when we were together. The difference is, I’ve started to enjoy weekends again. I look forward to Saturday nights. I’ve fallen in love with slow Sunday mornings all over again.

On my days off, I wake up early. I jog alone. I shop alone. I come home at night alone. I still go to coffee shops and visit those small restaurants we used to like, but now I go by myself. The seat across from me stays empty.

Still, I remember you. I remember how tightly you used to hold me, like you never wanted to let go. I remember how we laughed during our late-night drives. I even remember how annoyed you got when I brought food into your car. I think about the songs we used to play on repeat, and that feeling of excitement whenever we knew we would see each other again. I remember your kindness, your scent, and that smile that always made everything feel lighter.

But the truth is, I can’t clearly picture your face anymore.

Sometimes I lie in bed and quietly hope you’ll show up in my dreams, just so I can hold on to a piece of you. And sometimes, you do. But it’s always your smile, your voice, your touch, the way you smelled. Never your face. And honestly, that scares me. Because if we ever passed each other on some random street, I don’t think I would recognize you.

You once told me that maybe it would be a good thing if I forgot you. That hurt. Mostly because I think you were right.

Even so, I still remember the love we had. And I want you to know that I’m okay now. I’ve started to enjoy life on my own. I’ve been learning more about who I am without you. I’m healing. Slowly, but I’m getting there.

Maybe in a year or two, I’ll be walking down the aisle, holding someone else’s hand. But not yet. Right now, I’m giving myself the time to fall in love with my own soul and grieve a little more for what we lost.

Wherever you are, I hope you’re happy too.

Side note, the little plastic spray bottles these come in are starting to drive me insane. When you press them they very often leak fluid into the mechanism and instead of spritzing, 1 times out of 2 they drip.

*Top - Pear, Lily, Peach Blossom, Coconut, Aloe Vera, Rice Flower, Tea Rose*  
*Heart - Cream, Nectarine, Orange Blossom, Lactones, Silk Blossom*  
*Base - Egyptian musk, White musk, Light Vanilla*

This shares a lot of DNA with Snuggle Bug; the powdery laundry sheet base is the same. But just like last time, simply don't sniff the skin directly - it projects plenty and lasts a long time.

There's a touch of synthetic strawberry much like the top notes of Strawberry Crush but toned down. A cute, playful, girly scent. After an hour or so it fades into rice, like the powdered outside of a mochi. I like rice accords that are a little nutty and could almost be confused with pistachio, this one is more of a sugared Milchreis (a german rice pudding).

At the very end of it's life (a respectable 6 hours), chalky Valentine's Day heart candies come out to play. I suspect it's what's left of the very powdery base.

I'm not the kind of person who divides scents by gender or age normally but this one just screams tween girl to me to the point that even though I enjoy smelling it, I don't think I'd feel comfortable wearing this to the office.

**Angel Skin**

*Top - Candy floss, rose, pink pepper, spearmint*

*Medium - Buttercream, Hard candy, pineapple, plum, musk* 

*Bottom - Vanilla, caramel, cedarwood, Tonka*

Candy shop. Shelves overloaded with all different kinds of colourful sugars, air tinted pink by the red lenses of the heart-shaped glasses you're wearing. The base here is a more sniff-able coconut, it's strong but delectable on the skin.

I love that it has a touch of soapiness to it not like actual soap but more like lightly stale candy, it makes it so much more evocative of that mountain of powdery 90s candy we used to get on Halloween. This isn't a bag of Haribo, this is sugar candy watches and pink Hubba Bubba and Gobstoppers and giant displays of Jelly Belly. There's a creamy, milky note to the heart, possibly because of the coconut, that makes me think of Strawberry and Cream Chupa Chups.

Wouldn't even be surprised if an actual angels skin smelled like this, I need to wear it to the pool right now.

**Caramel Vanilla Praline**

*Top - Creamy lactonic notes, biscuit, sugar, coconut, tea rose*  
*Heart - Macadamia nut, hazelnut, butterscotch, Rosewood, popcorn*  
*Base - Vanilla, Amber, Benzoin, Cinnamon, Burnt Toffee, Caramel, Tonka, Cedarwood*

Maybe this one needs to rest a bit longer. If it changes, I'll add an update to a later review. 

For now, the opening is a little plasticky, chocolatey, ""Hershey's melted together with the wrapper."" There's also a kind of green patchouli-adjacent note mixed in with the vanilla that makes me think ""incense"" more than praline.

If it stays like this even after resting a few more weeks, I'll have to give it a

*Creme Brûlée*

*Top notes - Cream, Lactones, sugar cane*  
*Middle notes - Vanilla custard, vanilla extract, butter*  
*Base notes - Burnt sugar, caramel, maple syrup, Vanilla*

Caramel with overripe bananas (no clue where that note came from), milk pudding, rum. Crispy, sugary crust, a touch of spiced fruity wine. This is a delightful gourmand, it warms me from the inside out. Definitely a fall/winter kind of scent. Was asked if I was baking something when I wore it.

I want to spray it on a sweater and get cozy with hot tea and a book during a rainy day. Unfortunately, it is still the middle of summer, so I'll have to wait months until that can become reality.

There's a moment somewhere around the hour mark where this dips into lukewarm coffee, comforting but not overwhelming. The sugary accords here don't have the synthetic chalkiness of Angel Skin, they're closer to the real thing, caramelized and spread on a dessert.

Very much want to try layering it with Pistachio Almond Rose from the last review. I'll see how it behaves during colder weather before I  commit to a full-size,

**7/10**

Overall I'm very impressed with how many different notes of subtly different sweetness this house can produce despite occasional misses. I think it hits that niche of fantasy candy scents that's been really missing even in the indie perfume scene, and subsequently shows off **why** that niche is so underserved even though many people harbour desires to smell like mochi.

These are hard scents to get right and when they are right they have polarizing qualities like the soapy notes in Angel Skin and the extremely powdery base in Snuggle Bug. I suggest if any of you are interested in these, order a sample for yourselves first.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

>

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751386861.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

### **Chapter 6 – Resolution & Departure**

---

Dawn broke over Santa Yaya, pale gold light spilling across the mist that clung to the hills, birds calling from the wet trees. The storm had passed, leaving the world washed clean and glittering with dew. The *coquí* were quieter now, their nighttime chorus fading into sleepy chirps.

Mouse Capone stood in the village square beside the jeep, arms crossed, watching as Blue Puppy fussed over the giant *coquí* now contained within a makeshift pen of fishing nets, bamboo poles, and a tarp. The creature sat quietly, blinking its yellow eyes, croaking softly in the morning light, its massive throat pulsing like a drum.

“You think it’ll behave?” Minx asked, leaning against the jeep, sipping coffee.

“It’s just a frog,” Mouse replied, though he kept watching the creature carefully. “A very big frog.”

Minx smirked. “Bigger than your average case.”

Blue Puppy was practically vibrating with excitement, brushing mud off the *coquí’s* back, babbling about how he was going to teach it to catch flies, how it would need a proper pond, how it was definitely *not* going to eat him in his sleep.

Featherstone hovered nearby, clutching his notes, eyes red from a sleepless night. “We’ll need to find it a safe habitat,” he murmured. “An isolated wetland, low traffic, high humidity. Somewhere it can live out its life without… incidents.”

Inspector Elephant stomped up, hat low over his eyes, a fresh cup of coffee in hand. “You’re lucky the villagers think you’ve exorcised their Chupacabra. I told them we were taking the beast away for ‘scientific containment.’ They’re throwing a thank-you dinner tonight.”

Minx raised an eyebrow. “You staying for dinner?”

Inspector Elephant took a slow sip. “No.”

Mouse chuckled softly, glancing toward the village where the mayor and a few elders were busy repairing fences and dragging away the last of the ruined goat pens. Relief was evident in every tired smile they threw his way.

The mayor approached, offering Mouse a firm handshake. “Gracias, Señor Capone. We will sleep easy again.”

Mouse nodded, accepting the envelope of payment with his usual quiet efficiency. “Keep your livestock penned at night. And if you hear strange croaks, call me, not a mob with pitchforks.”

The mayor laughed nervously, nodding.

As the sun climbed higher, the crew began loading the *giant coquí’s* makeshift pen onto a flatbed trailer, Minx supervising the knots, Blue Puppy whispering good-luck wishes into the creature’s ear, and Featherstone hovering like a guilty father.

“Where will we take it?” Blue Puppy asked, eyes big with hope.

Mouse looked to Featherstone, who cleared his throat. “There’s an abandoned mangrove research station on the coast,” Featherstone said. “Quiet. Fenced. It’ll be safe there.”

Mouse nodded. “That’ll do.”

The frog let out a low, sleepy croak, blinking slowly, unbothered as the truck rumbled to life, shaking gently as it pulled away.

Blue Puppy waved. “Bye, Captain Ribbit! We’ll visit!”

Minx shook her head with a laugh. “You’re going to get attached.”

“I *am* attached,” Blue Puppy replied, wiping a tear from his fur.

Mouse climbed into the driver’s seat of the jeep, the engine purring to life. The warm breeze smelled of wet earth and coffee blossoms, the village slowly returning to its rhythm, the jungle at the edges alive but peaceful once more.

As the crew rolled down the muddy road, Mouse glanced in the mirror, watching the village fade behind them.

“Another monster defeated,” Minx said, smirking.

Mouse’s ears flicked. “It wasn’t a monster.”

Minx’s smile softened. “No. Guess it wasn’t.”

Blue Puppy leaned forward from the back seat, tail wagging. “Does this mean I get to pick our next case?”

“No,” Mouse and Minx replied in unison.

Featherstone, cradling his notes, looked out the window, thoughtful. “You know, the genetic drift required for that level of growth—”

Mouse held up a paw. “Not now, Professor.”

Featherstone sighed, slumping back in his seat, but a small smile tugged at his lips as the jeep rolled on.

Above them, the morning sky cleared, the sun breaking through the last of the clouds, painting the road ahead in gold.

The *coquí* chirped softly in the distance, the forest alive, but at peace once more.

And Mouse Capone drove on, toward the next misadventure.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

>

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751386817.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

### **Chapter 5 – The Reveal**

---  

The river glowed under the moon, swollen from days of rain, its muddy banks steaming in the cold air. Lanterns swung from low branches, casting rippling halos over the water. The jungle was loud with the *coquí* chorus, high chirps weaving an eerie blanket that only made the occasional *deep, resonant croak* more terrifying as it rolled across the dark.

Mouse crouched near the trap, checking the tension on the reinforced net Blue Puppy had rigged. It was crude—ropes strung over a branch system, triggered by a weighted tripline connected to a goat-skin lure and a sack of mineral salts. It was exactly the sort of nonsense that usually *shouldn’t* work.

But Mouse had learned never to underestimate Blue Puppy’s nonsense.

“Tripline’s too taut,” Minx said from behind him, chewing a stalk of grass, watching the tree line.

“Would you like to fix it?” Mouse asked, not looking up.

Minx smirked. “Nope. I’d like to watch.”

Inspector Elephant was sitting on a crate, sipping coffee, while Featherstone hovered anxiously, wringing his hands.

“It will come,” Featherstone said, voice tight. “If it’s looking for minerals, it will come.”

Mouse glanced at him. “If it doesn’t, you’re paying for the goats.”

Blue Puppy was in the brush across the clearing, eyes locked on the bait, paws clutching a small remote that would trigger a backup net if the manual tripline failed.

“It’s going to work,” Blue Puppy whispered into his headset.

“Just keep your eyes open,” Mouse replied.

For a long time, there was only the river and the chirping. Every leaf seemed to move in the breeze. Every shadow seemed alive. The forest felt like it was breathing.

Then, it came.

At first, it was only a vibration underfoot, subtle, like the beat of a distant drum. Then the deep croak, so close it rattled the lanterns, cutting through the *coquí* chorus and silencing it for a breathless moment.

From the trees, something moved—large, low, and smooth, pushing through ferns with heavy rustles. A flash of mottled green under lantern light. Another croak, so loud it shook water from the leaves.

Then it stepped into view.

The *giant coquí* stood nearly as tall as a human, squatting on powerful haunches, its slick, warty skin shimmering in shades of moss and mud. Its throat pulsed like a drum as it let out another croak, yellow eyes blinking with slow, alien curiosity. It sniffed the air, nostrils flaring, and hopped forward with shocking speed, landing near the bait with a *thud* that sent ripples across puddles.

Blue Puppy’s eyes were huge, his paw trembling on the trigger. “It’s so *beautiful*,” he whispered, tears welling up.

Minx’s mouth dropped open. “Okay… that’s… actually big.”

Featherstone made a choking sound. “My God… it survived… it *thrived*…”

Mouse’s eyes narrowed, taking in every detail. It was not a monster. It was not the devil-eyed goat killer of folklore. It was just… a *frog*, colossal and out of place, panting, its eyes blinking as it leaned down, tongue flicking to taste the mineral salt.

The tripline snapped.

The net dropped.

The *giant coquí* gave a startled croak as the net fell over its shoulders, flailing with its broad, sticky limbs, hopping backward and nearly toppling a small tree. Lanterns swayed wildly, shadows dancing as the frog’s croaks rose in pitch, panicked but harmless.

Blue Puppy triggered the backup net, which fired from a small launcher, tangling around the frog’s lower legs, finally toppling it into the mud with a wet, undignified *splut*.

Silence fell, broken only by the heavy, humiliated breathing of the giant frog as it blinked up at them from the mud, exhausted.

Blue Puppy ran forward, throwing himself onto the net with a triumphant yell. “*I caught the Chupacabra!*”

Minx holstered her gun, letting out a stunned laugh. “That’s… that’s a frog. That’s the world’s biggest frog.”

Featherstone was on his knees, shaking, tears streaming down his face. “It’s magnificent… it’s *perfect*…”

Inspector Elephant took a slow sip of coffee. “I hate you all so much.”

Mouse stepped forward, crouching down beside the creature. Its eyes tracked him, unblinking, afraid but not hostile. He reached out and gently touched the slick skin. It flinched, but didn’t strike.

“It’s not a monster,” Mouse said softly, looking back at the crew. “It’s just lost.”

The *giant coquí* croaked again, softer now, blinking slowly, mud dripping from its sides.

Blue Puppy was sobbing with joy, patting the net gently. “I’m going to name you… Captain Ribbit.”

Mouse closed his eyes, exhaling, letting the absurdity of it all sink in, the relief washing through the tension in his shoulders.

“Let’s get it contained,” he said, standing. “Before it decides it wants to go for another swim.”

Above them, the moon broke through the clouds, silver light falling over the soaked clearing, the jungle alive with the high chorus of the *coquí* again, the balance of sound returned, and somewhere in the distance, a rooster crowed, welcoming the dawn.

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.",1,1751386702.0,KomiSan,1,1.0,False

Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://tinyurl.com/mitolyn-get-now)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

---  

The rain had stopped, leaving the jungle steaming under the moonlight, every leaf glistening, the air thick and buzzing with the persistent chorus of *coquí* calls. Somewhere in the darkness, that *deep croak* rolled again, a bass note among the chimes, impossible to ignore.

Featherstone had gone quiet, shuffling beside Mouse as they made their way back to the jeep, the others trailing behind, weapons lowered but eyes sharp.

“Talk,” Mouse said, not looking at him.

Featherstone swallowed. “I didn’t think they’d survive. I *swear*. It was a small experiment—localized gene amplification using *coquí* as the base, splicing with dormant *gargantuan* DNA fragments, seeing if we could stimulate rapid regenerative tissue growth, potential organ harvesting—”

Mouse stopped, turning slowly, his ears twitching. “You made *giant frogs*.”

Featherstone’s shoulders slumped, water dripping from his hair. “I didn’t mean to.”

Minx, who was cleaning her pistol beside the jeep, scoffed. “I mean, I’ve heard of bad pets, but this is a new level.”

Featherstone’s eyes flared. “They were supposed to stay small, environmentally controlled! The plan was abandoned, and I left them in a pond to die. But the genetic drift—the environment, the rain cycles, available prey—something must have triggered dormant growth sequences.”

Mouse pinched the bridge of his nose, exhaling. “So we’re dealing with a giant, nutrient-leeching amphibian in a rainforest full of water and livestock.”

Featherstone nodded miserably.

Blue Puppy, who had been pacing in a circle clutching his trap wire, stopped dead. “It’s not a Chupacabra,” he said softly, eyes wide with realization. “It’s a *frog*. A big, slimy frog.”

Featherstone winced. “Technically, yes.”

Blue Puppy’s ears drooped. “But… but I wanted it to be real…”

Minx smirked. “Congratulations, kid, it’s real enough to eat your goats.”

Inspector Elephant arrived from the village road, holding a steaming coffee, his straw hat now battered from the rain. “Locals are losing it. I told them to stay indoors while we handle it.” He paused, looking at Featherstone. “And you… did what, exactly?”

Featherstone wilted under Elephant’s stare. “I made a *frog mistake*.”

Mouse ignored the byplay, focusing on the immediate problem. “We need to capture it or drive it away before it kills again. If the villagers see it, there’ll be a panic.”

Blue Puppy’s ears perked back up. “*I can catch it.*”

Minx gave him a long look. “Your last trap caught your own tail.”

Blue Puppy’s tail wagged. “But now I know what it is! I just need to adjust the bait, the trigger pressure, the—”

Featherstone cleared his throat. “It’s semi-aquatic. If we can lure it to water, it will slow down. It’s drawn to salt and mineral scents. That’s why it’s attacking livestock.”

Mouse nodded slowly. “We set a trap by the river. We lure it in, catch it, and then figure out what to do with it.”

Minx raised an eyebrow. “And if it doesn’t want to be caught?”

Mouse glanced at his holster. “Then we’ll improvise.”

A heavy *croak* echoed again, closer now, resonating through the trees. The leaves trembled, a few birds bursting out into the night sky in a panicked flurry.

Blue Puppy was vibrating with excitement again. “Let’s *get* him.”

Mouse locked eyes with Featherstone. “You’re coming with us. You started this.”

Featherstone gulped. “Understood.”

Inspector Elephant sipped his coffee, looking resigned. “Every time I go on vacation, I end up in the mud.”

They began preparing, Minx loading bait crates—salt licks, mineral blocks, a few old goatskins—and Blue Puppy furiously adjusting wires and pulleys, building a larger, reinforced trap near the muddy banks of the river just outside the village.

The moon hung heavy above the treetops as the *coquí* chorus swelled, hiding the single, deep croak that came again, impossibly close, rattling their bones.

Mouse pulled his hat low, glancing at the crew.

“All right,” he said. “Let’s catch ourselves a giant frog.”
