I ordered a refurbished Saeco Xelsis superautomatic from Seattle Coffee Gear this Christmas as a gift for my old man and ma. However, the package has been stuck at the FedEx depot of my local major city (Charlotte, NC) for over two weeks according to tracking. I opened a support ticket early on and have been calling FedEx and Seattle Coffee Gear customer support, however the most both have done is promise they’re looking into it and that they will call me back soon with more info (sadly neither have).

Any advice for dealing with a situation like this? I’m ready to throw in the towel and ask for a replacement just so I can get it to my folks before January is over, but I can’t find any other Xelsis on sale in the U.S. so it would be a hard item to replace. I’ve thought about just driving a few hours to Charlotte to see if I can visit the facility in person and pick it up. Would this ever work?

1qdkmr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qdkmr5/this_marsh_is_hungry/,This Marsh is Hungry,"People who grow up near marshland learn rules nobody explains. You do not go out after dark. You do not follow lights you cannot place. And when someone says part of the swamp is off limits, you do not ask why. In Hollow Marsh, people do not vanish with a lot of fanfare. They simply stop being part of daily life. The locals say something watches that place.

They call it the warden. The first thing I noticed about Hollow Marsh was the smell. It did not smell like normal swamp, not just mud and muck and rotten leaves. There was something thick in it, like pond water that had been trapped in a bucket for years.

It clung to the back of my throat as I stood at the edge of the wooden overlook, hands on the damp rail, staring out over the reeds. “Smell never really goes away,” a voice said behind me. “You get used to it. Or you move.” I turned and saw him, the same wiry old man who had been standing behind the counter at the gas station when I pulled into town that afternoon.

Same faded ball cap, same flannel shirt, same permanent frown carved into his cheeks. “You follow me out here?” I asked. He shrugged. “You asked where Hollow Marsh was. Figured you would end up here before dark. Outsiders always do.” “I am not a tourist,” I said. “I grew up here. Left when I was a kid.” He squinted at me, eyes narrowing. “What is your name then?” “Evan Pike.” His expression shifted.

Not friendly, but different. Recognition mixed with something like pity. “Jim Holloway,” he said. “I knew your father. He was a good man.” I did not know what to say to that, so I just turned back to the marsh. The water spread out in a wide shallow basin, choked with cattails and tall brown reeds. Trees leaned in around the edges as if they were all trying not to fall in.

The sun was sinking behind them, painting the water with broken strips of gold that did not reach very far. Near the middle of the marsh there was a dark patch, a round area where the vegetation thinned out and the water looked deeper. Even from the overlook, I could see that it was black. Not dark green, not brown. Black. “You should not be here this late,” Jim said quietly. “It is barely six,” I replied.

He did not answer that. Instead he stepped up beside me and rested his elbows on the rail. For a long time we both watched the marsh in silence. I had not come back for scenery. My father was dead, lungs finally giving up after decades in the mill, and I had inherited the ugly little house on the edge of town that no one wanted to buy.

I lost my job a month later, and the cheap answer was obvious. Move back. Live there. Start over in the place I had tried to forget. I told myself it was temporary. I told myself a lot of things. “What do you remember about this place?” Jim asked. I frowned. “Nothing. We moved away when I was eight.” “You remember your father coming out here with the search parties?  When the Miller boy went missing?”

Something stirred, deep in the part of my mind that remembered cold mornings and the smell of wet moss. My father, lacing up boots. My mother, saying it was not a good idea to involve himself. Arguments in the kitchen. My father saying something about doing his part. “I remember people talking,” I said slowly. “A kid fell in.” Jim eyed the marsh. “That is what they said.” “You don’t think so?” He snorted. “Kids fall in ponds.  Kids fall in rivers. They do not vanish in waist deep water while a dozen grown men are ten yards away with flashlights.”

I did not like the way he said vanish. “What happened then?” I asked. Jim scratched at his cheek. “The same thing that has always happened. The marsh took what it was due, and everything went back to normal for a while.” He said it like it was a simple fact. “What it was due?” I echoed. He sighed. “Your father never told you the story, did he?” “I guess not,” I said. Jim nodded, as if that confirmed something for him. He tapped the rail once with his knuckles. “Then let me tell you the one he should have told you,” he said. “It is the only rule that matters in this town.”

“The marsh does not fall behind.” The wind rattled the reeds like dry bones. A crow called from somewhere in the trees. The dark patch in the center of the marsh seemed to shift, as if something turned just under that flat black surface. I swallowed. “What does that even mean?” He glanced at the sky. The last strips of orange were fading to gray. “Not here,” he said. “Come by the station tomorrow morning, Six sharp. Bring coffee. Black. I will show you something. I shouldn’t have to say it but don’t stay here to much longer.”

Before I could argue, he pushed away from the railing and walked back down the path toward the gravel lot. I watched his outline shrink between the trees until he blended with the dark. The marsh waited in front of me, patient and still.

Then, from somewhere near that black patch, I saw a ripple. Not a small wave. Not wind. A wide, slow circle spreading outward, as if something very large had moved just below the surface. I told myself it was a fish. A log. A trick of light. Then I left. The next morning I poured two coffees into paper cups from the old machine in my kitchen, drove into town, and found Jim already waiting in front of the gas station.

He was leaning against the ice machine, arms folded, as if he had been there for hours. “You are late,” he said, taking the cup without thanks. “It is six o five,” I replied. “In this town that counts as late.” He jerked his head toward the side of the station and started around it. I followed, feeling like a kid again, dragged along by some adult who had decided to share a story I was not sure I wanted.

Behind the station was a cinderblock garage, a row of rusty oil drums, and, tucked back against the fence, a small office trailer. Jim unlocked the door and led me inside. The trailer smelled like dust and old paper. Metal shelves lined the walls, stacked with cardboard boxes and binders. There was a desk with a cracked plastic top, a single chair, and a crooked corkboard covered in yellowed newspaper clippings.

Jim nodded at the wall. “There.” I stepped closer. The clippings were all about Hollow Marsh. LOCAL TEEN MISSING NEAR HOLLOW MARSH. SEARCH CONTINUES FOR MISSING HUNTER, WOMAN VANISHES AFTER NIGHT NEAR MARSH The dates ran in a rough pattern. Nineteen Seventy one. Seventy four. Seventy eight. Eighty two. The gaps were not exact, but they were close.

Three or four years apart, over and over. I scanned downward, tracking the years. There were a few mentions of drownings in other places, a car wreck on the highway, a house fire. Jim had circled the words about the marsh in red ink. “That is only the ones they admit to,” he said. “The drunk who wandered in and never walked out. The kid who liked to sneak out at night. The woman whose husband swore she left town. If the last place they were seen was within spitting distance of Hollow Marsh, I count it.”

I swallowed. “So what is the pattern then?” Jim stepped up beside me and pointed a nicotine stained finger at the rows of dates. “Count the years between them,” he said. “Roughly three. Sometimes two, sometimes four. But the count is steady. The marsh takes someone on a schedule. When it does, the town gets a quiet stretch. No accidents, no drownings, no odd vanishings. Then the count creeps up again.”

“You think this is deliberate?” I asked. “I do not think,” Jim replied. “I know. The older folks had a name for the thing in the swamp.  They called it the Warden. Something that keeps tally in that water.”

I let out an unsteady laugh. “So this is, what, a town monster story to keep kids out of the mud?” “If it was just that,” he said, “you would not see this.” He tapped a clipping near the bottom of the board. It was newer, maybe fifteen years old. THIRD LOCAL MISSING IN A YEAR, ALL LAST SEEN NEAR HOLLOW MARSH.

I read the subheading. Then I noticed the date. The same year my father packed us up and moved. “I do not remember this,” I said, voice low. “You were a kid,” Jim said. “Your father did not want you anywhere near it. He was out there every night with the search parties. “What happened?” I asked. “The marsh fell behind,” Jim said simply. “Four years went by with no one taken.

People thought it was over. They started walking their dogs down there. Kids went to drink at the overlook. Then that year came, and it took three before the frost.” “Accidents,” I said weakly. Jim shook his head. “All of them were people who should have known better. A man who tried to drain part of it for a building project. A kid who boasted about swimming across it. A woman who used to dump trash in the reeds at night. The Warden does not just keep count. It also punishes.”

I turned away from the board. My head felt stuffed. “This is insane,” I said. “You cannot blame a swamp for every bad thing that happens near town.” “You can believe whatever you want,” Jim replied. “I am telling you the rule. The warden does not fall far behind. If it goes too long without a proper offering, that thing in the water comes looking.”

I did not sleep much that night. The house my father left me creaked in the wind. Every sound was like a footstep outside the door or a slap of something against the windows. I knew it was my own mind, stirred up by stories and clippings, but logic grows stale in the dark.

I got out of bed around midnight and walked to the kitchen for water. As I stood in the narrow hallway, I heard it. A faint sound, far off but clear in the stillness. Slosh. Slosh. Slosh. As if someone were walking while completely soaked, heavy boots full of water, every step leaving a puddle. I froze. The sound drifted, not quite outside the house, not quite inside.

It seemed to move along the street, past the front of the house, then fade toward town. You are imagining it, I told myself. In the morning, when I stepped onto the porch, there were no wet footprints. The dusty road looked the same. But something small had been left on the top step. A clutch of marsh reeds, tied together with a strip of filthy cloth.

I stared at it for a long time. By mid morning, the whole town knew. “Jim says it is a sign,” the cashier told me at the grocery store. “Means the count is coming due.” At the post office, an old woman shook her head. “Should have seen this coming. No one has gone missing in years.” At the diner, the waitress poured my coffee and whispered, “If you hear knocking after midnight, do not answer the door.” “I thought this was about the marsh,” I said. She shivered. “You think that thing cares where you are standing when it takes you?”

That afternoon I drove back out to Hollow Marsh because I had no better ideas and because fear does not always tell you to stay away. Sometimes it drags you closer. The overlook was empty. The air above the water shimmered with heat, but the marsh itself looked cold.

Flies buzzed in slow circles. The dark patch near the center had grown, or I had convinced myself it had. I leaned on the rail and tried to breathe. “All right,” I said under my breath. “If you are real, show me something.” Nothing happened, of course. Then I had the thought that ruined everything. What if you could cheat it?

If the Warden needed a body to keep its count straight, maybe it did not care where that body came from. If something already dead ended up in that water, would it be enough to satisfy whatever rule the marsh obeyed? On the ride back into town, I passed the small veterinary clinic on the edge of the highway. Out back there was a bright blue dumpster.

The idea finished forming. This is not your problem, I told myself. You could move. But the truth sat heavy in my chest. I did not have the money to move. I did not have a job waiting anywhere. The house was paid off. The only asset I had was planted at the edge of this town, and this town was planted at the edge of that marsh.

If the Warden was real, I was stuck with it. For the rest of the day, I tried not to think about the dumpster behind the clinic. By nightfall I had lost that fight. Clouds swallowed the moon. The road to Hollow Marsh was a strip of darker gray between the trees. I drove with my lights off for the last quarter mile, wincing at every crackle of gravel under the tires.

The bundle on the passenger seat smelled like freezer burn and something metallic. The clinic dumpster had not been locked. The thick black bags had been heavier than I expected. I told myself they were only animal remains, things already gone, things no one wanted. I parked behind a screen of scrub trees, far from the small gravel lot near the overlook path.

No one drove out here after dark if they could help it. My heart still hammered like I was about to rob a bank. I hauled the bag out of the car, staggered under the weight, and half dragged it down the path. Every twig that snapped seemed to reverberate through the area. Frogs stopped croaking as I passed, as if the whole marsh were holding its breath.

At the edge of the walkway, I stopped. The marsh stretched out in front of me, a black sheet broken by darker shapes. The smell was stronger at night, sour and heavy. “This is stupid,” I whispered. I wrestled the bag over the rail, tore it open with a box cutter, and spilled its contents into the water. “There,” I said through my teeth. “That should count for something.” The marsh swallowed it without comment.

For a long moment I stood there, waiting for some sign. Lightning. A roar. A voice from the reeds. Anything. Nothing came. Then, from directly below the overlook, I heard a sound. Not a splash. Not a frog. A slow, thick gurgle. Like someone trying to breathe through a throat full of mud. Something pale moved just under the surface, brushing against the submerged posts of the walkway.

Skin, I thought wildly. That is skin. I stumbled back, almost fell, then turned and ran up the path, branches slapping my arms. I could hear the sound behind me, following the posts, scraping along the wood. At the car, I fumbled the keys and dropped them, cursed, picked them up with shaking hands, and finally got the engine started.

Gravel spat from under the tires as I tore away from the marsh and did not slow down until the first streetlights of town appeared ahead. By the time I collapsed into bed, dawn was bleeding into the sky. When I woke, it was to the sound of my phone buzzing on the nightstand. I answered without checking the display. “Evan,” Jim said on the other end. His voice sounded strained and brittle. “Turn on your television.” “It doesn’t work,” I said. “Then go stand outside,” he replied. “You will hear enough.”

He hung up. My mouth was dry. I rolled out of bed, pulled on yesterday’s jeans, and walked to the front door. When I opened it, the first thing I heard was the wail of a siren. It came from somewhere near the highway, long and rising, then cut off, then started again. Other sounds carried with it. Shouting. A woman crying. The chop of a helicopter far off. I stepped off the porch. Neighbors were gathered in the road, some in bathrobes, some in work clothes, all looking in the same direction. Toward the edge of town and the tree line that hid the marsh. “Car went in,” someone said. “Up by the clinic.” “Took the ditch too fast,” another voice added. “Hit the embankment and went straight into the drainage pond.” My heart dropped straight through my ribs. Drainage pond. Clinic. “Did they get them out?” I asked. A man I recognized from the diner shook his head. “Driver was pinned. Water filled the cab before anybody could reach him.”

“Who was it?” I whispered. He hesitated. “Doctor Reeves. The vet."" The man whose name was painted on the side of the clinic in tidy letters. The man whose practice I had raided for the pieces I had dumped into the marsh. He had been working late, I thought. Maybe locking up.

Maybe taking the curve faster than usual because he wanted to get home. Maybe his tires slipped on something. Or maybe the thing that keeps count had decided that if I wanted to involve his clinic in the ledger, it would balance it in its own way. My stomach twisted. I felt something watching us. Not from the crowd, not from the road, but from farther off.

The tree line swayed, leaves trembling. The air smelled faintly of stagnant water. The marsh does not fall behind. The words rang in my head, in Jim’s voice. I turned and got into my car. I found Jim at the overlook. He stood at the rail, staring at the dark patch in the center of the marsh. The sky above was cloudy and low, crushing the light out of everything. “You did something stupid,” he said without looking at me.

I opened my mouth to deny it, then closed it again. There did not seem to be much point. “I thought it would work,” I said. My voice sounded small in the open air. “If it just needed bodies, then maybe there was a way to feed it without anyone else getting hurt.” Jim laughed once. It was an ugly sound. “You tried to bargain with something that does not know what a bargain is,” he said. “That thing in there only understands two numbers. Ahead and behind.”

“They were already dead in that bag.” “The Warden does not care,” Jim replied. “You pointed at that clinic and told the marsh that is where you wanted the count to come from. It took you at your word.” He finally turned to face me.

His eyes were bloodshot. “Do you understand now?” he asked. “There is no cheating. There is no offering some poor animal and calling it even. There is only the count. If you try to dodge it, bend it, move it over an inch, it snaps back and takes more.” My throat was tight. “So what happens now?” “The same thing that always happens,” Jim said. “People mourn. They put flowers by the ditch. They say it was bad luck, a slick patch, a moment of distraction. They forget the reeds that will start growing thicker there next year.”

“And the warden?” I forced myself to ask. His gaze shifted past me, out over the water. “For a while, it is ahead,” he said. “When the frost comes, it will be even.

Then the years start again.” I stared at the black patch. It seemed larger now. I could see something moving under the surface, just at the edge of my vision. Not a fish. Not a log. Something bigger. Something that brushed the reeds aside as it passed. The wind shifted, carrying the smell around us. In it, under the rot and mud, I thought I could smell something else.

Antiseptic. Rubber gloves. The faint memory of a clinic hallway. “I did not mean for that to happen,” I said. He sighed. “Intention does not count for much with things like this.” For a long time we stood there without speaking. Finally Jim said, “You have a choice to make, Evan. Same one your father faced.” “Leave?” I asked.

He nodded. “Some folks stay. They make peace with it. They pretend it is all coincidence. They live with the knowledge that every few years the water will take someone, and they just hope it is not them or theirs. Others decide they do not want that thing in their rear view mirror every day.” “And my father?” I asked. “He stayed as long as he thought he was helping,” Jim replied. “After that year with the three of them, he knew he could not do anything.

So he packed you up and left. Tried to keep the story from following you.” I thought of the house, the unpaid bills, the empty job listings in town. I thought of the clinic, the twisted wreck of the car in the ditch, the reeds that would grow around that spot. “I have nowhere else to go,” I said. “That is the lie this place loves the most,” Jim said softly.

We both watched as a slow ripple spread outward from the center of the marsh. It rolled under the mat of reeds and lapped against the posts of the overlook. For a moment, as the water rose against the wood, I saw something pressed to the surface. A face. Bloated, pale, eyes open and staring. Mouth full of black water. It might have been my imagination, stitched together from fear and guilt.

Then it sank, leaving only the usual dark. “You see it now,” Jim whispered. “Yeah,” I said. At home, I walked through the rooms without really seeing them. The old photos. The sagging couch. The boxes I had not unpacked. My father had tried to cut me free of this place. I had moved right back into its shadow. In the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face.

When I looked up, the mirror showed my reflection, pale and tired. For a second, as the water dripped from my chin, I thought I saw something standing behind me in the doorway. Tall. Thin. Shape made of dripping reeds and black, rippling skin, as if someone had stuffed a body with murky water and let it walk around without bones.

Its face wasn’t quite a face, features suggested by light and shadow. Where eyes should have been, dark sockets stared back at me. I blinked. The doorway was empty. My heart slammed against my ribs hard enough to hurt. It was not in the house, I told myself. It was in my head. In the marsh.

I sat down on the edge of the tub and buried my face in my hands. After a while, I stood, walked to the bedroom, and dragged my suitcase from under the bed. I did not have a plan. I did not have a job waiting anywhere else. I had half a tank of gas and a mind full of fear. But I knew one thing. Staying felt less like survival and more like standing at the lip of a dark hole, waiting for my turn.

As I carried the suitcase through the front room, I paused at the window. From there I could see, far off beyond the stand of trees, a faint shimmer where the marsh lay. For a moment, I thought I saw something tall standing in the water, right at the edge of the dark patch. Watching the town. Waiting. The distance made it impossible to be sure.

It might have been a dead tree. A trick of light. Or it might have been the Warden, counting. I set my jaw, turned away, and walked out the door, got in my car, and drove. I did not look in the rear view mirror until I was miles away. But I knew the marsh was back there, patient, watching. It would not miss me. It would not chase me.

It did not need to. Somewhere, sooner or later, in that slow black water, someone else would step too close to the edge. Someone would slip. Someone would think they were safe. Because no one ever warned them. No one ever told them about the creature that keeps score in the dark water. The warden would keep its count.

1qdkmac,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qdkmac/how_to_be_verbally_engaging_without_trying_too/,How to Be Verbally ENGAGING Without Trying Too Hard: The Psychology That Actually Works,"okay so i've been kinda obsessed with this lately because i noticed something wild. most people aren't actually BAD at conversation. they're just operating on outdated scripts their anxious brain keeps feeding them. like we've all been trained to think good conversation = perfectly timed jokes + zero awkward pauses + sounding smart. and that's precisely what makes us boring as hell.

i spent way too much time analyzing this (books, podcasts, even studying comedians and podcast hosts) because i was tired of leaving interactions feeling like i missed something. not anymore. here's what actually works.

 1. stop performing, start reacting

the biggest trap is treating conversation like a performance where you're waiting for your turn to deliver pre-planned content. that's not engaging, that's taking turns reading monologues.

instead, actually listen and react authentically to what's being said. like genuinely process it. when someone says ""i just got back from japan,"" your brain probably auto-generates ""oh cool how was it?"" but that's NPC dialogue. 

try this: let their statement actually land. notice what specifically interests you about it. then respond to THAT. ""wait you went to japan? i've been watching this youtube channel about japanese convenience stores and i'm lowkey obsessed now, did you try any weird snacks?"" 

see the difference? you're bringing your actual personality into it, creating texture. conversations get interesting when people reveal their weird specific interests, not when they stick to the script.

**The Charisma Myth** by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down brilliantly. she's a former advisor to Google and taught this stuff at Berkeley. the book won multiple awards and honestly changed how i think about presence. she argues that charisma isn't about being the loudest or funniest, it's about making people feel heard through genuine presence and focus. one chapter talks about how people can sense when you're mentally rehearsing your next line instead of listening. insanely good read if you want to understand the mechanics behind why some people just feel magnetic.

 2. embrace the pause (seriously)

we're all terrified of silence because we think it signals failure. it doesn't. rushed conversation signals anxiety.

comfortable people pause. they think before speaking. they let moments breathe. this might feel excruciating at first but it's actually what separates engaging speakers from nervous ones.

when someone asks you something, you can literally say ""hmm good question, let me think"" and take 3 seconds. nobody's timing you. that pause communicates that you're taking them seriously enough to give a real answer.

 3. specificity is your superpower

vague statements = forgettable. specific details = memorable and engaging.

instead of ""work was rough today,"" try ""my coworker accidentally sent a rant about our boss to our boss and i watched it happen in real time on slack."" 

instead of ""i like music,"" try ""i've been stuck in this weird hyperpop rabbit hole and i can't tell if it's genius or if my taste is broken.""

specificity does two things. it gives people actual material to respond to, and it signals you're comfortable being yourself. that's what engaging means, you're giving people entry points into your actual world.

 4. ask better questions (not more questions)

people think being a good conversationalist means asking tons of questions. wrong. that's just conducting an interview.

the trick is asking questions that invite storytelling, not data collection. 

bad: ""what do you do?""
better: ""what's the weirdest part of your job that nobody would expect?""

bad: ""do you have hobbies?""
better: ""what's something you've gotten unreasonably into lately?""

these questions bypass the rehearsed answers people have ready and actually make them think. that's when conversations get interesting.

**We Need To Talk** by Celeste Headlee (she's an NPR host who's done thousands of interviews) is exceptional on this. won several journalism awards and she basically wrote the manual on productive conversation. her main thesis is that good conversation requires genuine curiosity, not technique. this book will make you question everything you think you know about how to talk to people. one chapter specifically destroys the myth that you need to find ""common ground"" because actually, differences create way more interesting dynamics.

 5. match and lead energy

engaging doesn't mean dominating. it means reading the room and calibrating.

if someone's low energy and contemplative, going full high energy ""let me entertain you"" mode will feel jarring. match their energy first, build rapport, THEN you can gradually shift the vibe if you want.

conversely, if someone's excited about something, meet them there. nothing kills engagement faster than responding to someone's enthusiasm with flat affect.

**BeFreed** is an AI-powered personalized learning app that pulls from books, expert interviews, and research papers to create custom audio podcasts on whatever skill you're working on, like social dynamics or communication patterns. 

Built by Columbia grads and former Google AI experts, it generates learning plans based on your specific goals. You can customize the depth (10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples) and pick voices that actually make learning addictive, from sarcastic to that smooth Samantha-from-Her style. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with mid-podcast to ask questions or get book recommendations. It's been genuinely useful for understanding conversational patterns beyond surface-level tips.

 6. tell stories with structure (even tiny ones)

even mundane things become engaging with basic story structure. setup, tension, resolution.

boring: ""i went to the store and they were out of milk.""

engaging: ""so i specifically went to the store just for milk, right? and i'm standing in the dairy aisle and there's every possible milk EXCEPT regular milk. oat milk, almond milk, some weird pea protein situation. i ended up having black coffee for three days because i was too stubborn to go back.""

see how the second version has a mini arc? it invites the other person into the experience. they can picture it, they can relate to the frustration, there's a small payoff.

 7. reveal something real (strategically)

the most engaging people aren't perfect, they're authentic. they'll admit they're anxious about something or that they have no idea what they're doing in some area.

vulnerability creates connection, but it needs to be calibrated. you're not trauma dumping, you're showing you're human.

""honestly i have no idea how to network, i always feel like i'm bothering people"" is relatable and opens space for real conversation. it's way more engaging than pretending you've got it all figured out.

the podcast **The Tim Ferriss Show** has endless examples of this. Ferriss interviews top performers but he always asks about failures, anxieties, and moments of doubt. those are consistently the most compelling parts because suddenly these successful people become human and relatable. binge a few episodes and notice how vulnerability actually increases engagement rather than diminishing it.

 8. reference callback to earlier points

this is subtle but powerful. when someone mentions something earlier in conversation and you reference it later, it shows you were actually listening and processing.

""wait didn't you say your sister lives in portland? she must be dealing with the same weather stuff you were just describing.""

it creates conversational continuity and makes people feel genuinely heard.

 9. be okay with disagreement

agreeable doesn't equal engaging. some of the best conversations involve friendly disagreement.

if someone says something you don't fully agree with, you can say ""hmm i see that perspective but i think about it differently"" and explain why. that creates actual dialogue instead of just nodding along.

obviously read the context. maybe don't debate your boss at the company meeting. but in casual conversation, respectful disagreement often leads to the most interesting exchanges.

 10. practice with low stakes interactions

you don't level up social skills by waiting for high pressure situations. you do it through volume with low stakes interactions.

chat with baristas, make small talk in lines, comment on something in your environment to a stranger. these micro interactions are your training ground. the more you do them, the more your brain stops treating conversation as a threat.

**Insight Timer** has some solid guided meditations specifically for social anxiety that help before going into situations where you want to practice. it's free and has like 100k meditations. the ones focused on grounding and present moment awareness are clutch for getting out of your head before social stuff.

look, nobody's asking you to become some charismatic guru overnight. small shifts compound. start with one or two of these and actually implement them. notice what happens when you pause instead of rushing. pay attention to how people respond when you get specific instead of generic.

you're probably way more interesting than you're currently allowing yourself to be. the goal isn't to master verbal game like it's some technique. it's to remove the barriers stopping you from just being present and real with people. that's what engaging actually means.",1,1768486448.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

After making multiple attempts, I finally quit my final vice, THC. So I'm no longer California Sober. I can confidently say, I'm not going back.

After I quit drinking, I leaned into weed as my last crutch. On the quest to quell my anxiety, I quit caffeine about 6 months ago, it was crazy and took me two months to ween myself off and feel somewhat normal again, my blood pressure dropped several points and my doctor says I can go off meds.

Once the coffee was done, I began to notice that the THC made my heart race and my blood pressure spike, so I switched form oil to flower (whiskey to beer) thinking that would help and it absolutely didn't. I actually started to use less because it was starting to make me feel bad. So I leaned into it and focused on how bad it made me feel and gradually, the desire began to fade and a couple weeks ago I just stopped. I could not have done it if I were still drinking, all my tools were sharp and ready for me and it made withdrawals somewhat easier for me.

After two weeks of complete sobriety, I can honestly say I'm never going back, if I can help it at all. I think I was truly both mentally and physically ready, but I had no idea it would take almost two years.

Anyway, just sharing my experience, feel free to follow up with me to keep me accountable, because even if I relapse, it doesn't have to be a total waste.

Without all of you I would not have been able to do this, and I want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart.

1qdkhmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1qdkhmr/how_to_build_emotional_attraction_the_psychology/,How to Build EMOTIONAL ATTRACTION: The Psychology That Actually Works (Science-Backed),"Let's get real for a second. You've probably heard all the surface level crap about building attraction, confidence, being yourself, blah blah blah. But here's what nobody's talking about: emotional attraction is NOT about doing tricks or following some pickup artist playbook. It's about understanding human psychology at a deeper level and actually becoming someone worth being attracted to. 



I spent years diving into research, reading attachment theory, listening to experts like Esther Perel and Matthew Hussey, watching way too many psychology videos, and honestly fumbling through my own connections. What I found? Most advice is garbage. But some patterns kept showing up in the science, the books, and real life experiences. So here's what actually works.



 Step 1: Stop Being Boring (Seriously, You're Putting People to Sleep)



Emotional attraction dies in predictability. If every conversation with you feels like a job interview or small talk at a funeral, you're done. People are attracted to emotional depth and novelty, not your resume.



Here's the shift: Share stories that reveal something about WHO you are, not just WHAT you do. Instead of ""I work in marketing,"" try ""I accidentally sent a client email to my entire company last week and had to own it in front of everyone. Humbling as hell."" Vulnerability creates connection. Safe, surface level chat creates nothing.



Research from Dr. Arthur Aron (the guy behind the famous 36 questions study) shows that mutual vulnerability accelerates intimacy. You can't build emotional attraction if you're always wearing a mask.



Action: Next time you're talking to someone, share one thing that's actually real about your day, your feelings, or a recent experience. Watch how the energy shifts.



 Step 2: Master the Art of Presence (Put Your Damn Phone Down)



You know what's insanely attractive? Someone who actually listens. Not the fake nodding while thinking about what you're gonna say next. Real, focused, give a shit listening.



Most people are so stuck in their own heads or distracted by notifications that they've forgotten how to be present. When you give someone your full attention, it triggers something primal. They feel seen. They feel valued. That's emotional crack.



Esther Perel talks about this in her book Mating in Captivity (genuinely one of the most eye opening books on desire and attraction I've ever read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about relationships and why spark dies). She explains that attention is the ultimate aphrodisiac. 



Action: In your next conversation, practice active listening. Repeat back what they said in your own words. Ask follow up questions that show you're actually tracking. No interrupting. No checking your phone. Just presence.



 Step 3: Create Emotional Peaks and Valleys (Flat Lines Are for Dead People)



Here's the uncomfortable truth: Consistency is comfortable, but comfort kills attraction. People don't fall for stability, they fall for the emotional rollercoaster, the unexpected moments, the surprises.



This doesn't mean play mind games or be an unreliable flake. It means inject spontaneity and emotion into your interactions. Plan something unexpected. Have passionate opinions. Disagree when you actually disagree. Show excitement when you're excited. Stop being so neutral and safe all the time.



Matthew Hussey (relationship coach who actually knows his stuff) talks about this in his content constantly. Emotional attraction thrives on dynamic energy, not monotone existence.



Action: Do something spontaneous this week. Suggest a random adventure. Share a strong opinion. Create a moment that breaks the pattern.



 Step 4: Develop Your Own Life (Stop Being a Leech)



Nothing kills emotional attraction faster than neediness. If your entire world revolves around one person or you have nothing interesting going on in your life, you become draining instead of magnetic.



People are attracted to people who have their own passions, hobbies, friendships, and goals. It's not about playing hard to get, it's about actually being someone with a full life that others want to be part of.



I started using Ash (an AI relationship coach app that's honestly pretty solid for getting perspective on patterns in your behavior) and one thing it kept pointing out was how much I was over investing in connections while neglecting my own interests. 



For anyone wanting to dive deeper into the psychology behind attraction without committing hours to dense textbooks, there's BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that turns insights from relationship psychology books, research papers, and experts like Esther Perel into personalized audio sessions. You can tell it your specific goal, like ""become more confident in dating as an introvert,"" and it builds a structured learning plan pulling from sources directly relevant to your situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. What stood out was the voice options, there's a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology feel like advice from a sharp friend rather than a lecture. It's useful for making self-improvement feel less like homework and more like something that actually fits into commutes or gym time.



Built some habits with Finch (cute habit building app with a little bird companion, don't judge me, it works) to focus on hobbies and self growth. Game changer.



Action: Identify three things you're genuinely interested in that have nothing to do with dating or relationships. Invest time in them weekly.



 Step 5: Be Emotionally Intelligent (Read the Room, For the Love of God)



Emotional attraction requires emotional intelligence. Can you read social cues? Do you understand when someone needs space versus connection? Can you regulate your own emotions instead of exploding or shutting down?



Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships shows that emotional attunement (being able to recognize and respond to your partner's emotional needs) is one of the strongest predictors of relationship success. This applies to building attraction too.



If you're clueless about emotions, read Emotional Intelligence 2.0 by Travis Bradberry. Quick read, practical strategies, cuts through the fluff. It breaks down self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management in ways that actually make sense.



Action: Start naming your emotions throughout the day. ""I'm feeling anxious."" ""I'm excited."" ""I'm frustrated."" This simple practice builds emotional awareness.



 Step 6: Show Up As Your Authentic Self (But Make Sure Your Authentic Self Isn't Trash)



Here's where people get confused. ""Just be yourself"" is half right. Yes, authenticity is attractive. But if your authentic self is negative, entitled, or emotionally stunted, being yourself isn't gonna cut it. You have to be yourself AND work on becoming a better version of yourself.



Authenticity means not pretending to be someone you're not. But growth means recognizing your flaws and actively working on them. That combination is magnetic.



Action: Ask three people who know you well what your biggest blind spot is. Listen without defending yourself. Then work on it.



 Step 7: Create Shared Experiences (Memories Trump Conversations)



Emotional bonds form through shared experiences, not endless texting. You want to build attraction? Do things together. Go on adventures. Try new activities. Create inside jokes. Build a shared history.



Research shows that novel experiences trigger dopamine, which your brain associates with the person you're with. That's why first dates at escape rooms or concerts often feel more connected than coffee dates.



Action: Plan something you've both never done before. Cooking class, hiking trail, random road trip, doesn't matter. New experiences together.



 Step 8: Maintain Mystery (But Don't Be Fake Mysterious, That's Cringe)



There's a difference between healthy mystery and playing games. Healthy mystery means you don't dump your entire life story in the first conversation. You reveal layers over time. You're not an open book on page one.



But fake mysterious is when you're vague for the sake of being vague or withhold basic information to seem interesting. That's just annoying.



Action: Share things gradually. Don't frontload everything about yourself. Let people discover you over time.



 Step 9: Physical Touch (When Appropriate, Don't Be Weird)



Emotional attraction has a physical component. Appropriate touch, a hand on the shoulder, a playful nudge, sitting close, releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone). Obviously respect boundaries and read the situation, but don't be afraid of non sexual physical connection.



Action: If the vibe is right and consent is clear, incorporate small, natural touches into interactions.



 Step 10: Stop Trying So Hard (Desperation Repels, Ease Attracts)



Here's the final truth bomb: The harder you try to force attraction, the less attractive you become. Desperation has a smell. People can sense when you're trying too hard, when you need their validation, when you're performing instead of connecting.



The most attractive energy is relaxed confidence. Not arrogant. Not try hard. Just comfortable in your own skin and genuinely interested in connection without needing it.



Action: Remind yourself daily that your worth isn't determined by whether someone is attracted to you. That shift in energy changes everything.

Look, building emotional attraction isn't about manipulation or tricks. It's about becoming emotionally mature, present, authentic, and interesting. It's inner work disguised as relationship advice. The science backs it up. The experts preach it. And real life proves it.



Stop looking for shortcuts. Do the work. Become magnetic by actually being worth being attracted to.

I’ve been obsessing over simple binary choices lately (Coffee vs. Tea, Dark Mode vs. Light Mode, etc.).

To test this, I built a service that runs calculations on user choices to see if there are hidden correlations in the data. Basically, I'm trying to see if knowing your preference for ""Pineapple on Pizza"" can actually help a model predict other random demographic facts or habits.

It’s a fun side project/experiment, but I’ve put some work into the backend logic.

Chapter 1

It is the 9th of September, 1996. My beloved dog, Charlie—named after Chaplin—has just passed away, leaving me completely alone in this maze of a house. My days have grown quiet; their only colour comes from the three cups of coffee my butler brings me each day, sometimes even at night. In this stillness, I find myself returning to my youth in Pennsylvania: the sheep I tended, the fields I roamed, the big man who drove the Ford, and my dearest friend Freddy—the big man’s son.

These thoughts have stirred up an enthusiasm that I haven’t known since my youth. I find myself imagining those days in my day-to-day life, and they have begun hindering me from my work. It was, however, not until today that I realized I must go back to Pennsylvania once, to get things off my chest and have some peace and quiet to reflect upon my choices.

Upon this thought entering my mind and my green-lighting it, I got up from my armchair and went to the garage, a place I hadn’t been to in a long time, given how sparsely I left my home. I was delighted to find the Cadillac in pristine condition. Its paint was clean enough to see my face in. This success filled me with hope that my journey might be fruitful. As I inspected the car, my butler appeared in the doorway and asked me,

“Sir, you seem to have taken a new fascination with cars. Might I inquire why?”

“You see, Gerard, I am going to Pennsylvania for some old business, and I will motor the way there.”

Gerard nodded.

“Of course, sir. When do you wish to leave, might I ask?”

I thought about it for a moment. Tomorrow would be too soon, and next week would be too long a wait.

“Day after tomorrow.”

Gerard gave a slight bow and walked out.

I stayed in the garage for a while, opening the car doors, closing them, sitting in the driver’s seat, and turning on the engine for the first time in months. It whined for a moment before shuddering to life. It was at this moment that another variable appeared in my mind that I hadn’t considered: I can’t continuously drive for such a long trip, which meant I’ll have to stay in hotels and guest houses, which will increase the duration of my journey greatly and might provide me with less time in Pennsylvania. But then I realized that these stays might just be what I need; they will allow me to read some books I have been meaning to for a long time and also explore those places where I stop.

Feeling successful and content, I walked to my bedroom and retired for the night after a cup of coffee (by Gerard).

The next morning brought a palpable sense of excitement, and I found myself pacing my room like a restless kid. My mind was already in Pennsylvania, among the ready-for-harvest crops, leaning by the soft fur of the sheep and imagining the long walks that I will have there.

It was not until Gerard knocked on the door that I realized that I had been in my room for almost an hour. The whole day passed in a blur, with only my body present. I packed my clothes, not caring about professionalism or class, only comfort. I got my books down from the libraries, and I retrieved the dusty old photo albums from their shelves where they had sat for eternity. I was mildly surprised that they hadn’t grown roots and merged with the shelves. The entire house staff was busy preparing the essentials for my journey, and even with my considerable number of rejections, they filled the back of the Cadillac up to the brim. I was amused to see Matthias sitting on the back door to close it; I have a feeling that there will be an explosion in the hotel parking lots.

I went to sleep that night feeling a little bit of regret for not going there sooner, to meet Fred sooner, but later is better than never, and I went to sleep with that sentiment.

I am now on the precipice of my journey. My car is stocked, I have bid the servants farewell, and I am sitting in the driver’s seat. It’s a bittersweet feeling being so close to going back to the place you left behind.

I turn the key, and the engine whirs back into life. I take a deep breath, press my foot on the gas, and my journey has begun.

Chapter 2

The day’s drive began peacefully enough. For the first fifteen minutes, the view was occupied by grand lawns, white picket fences, and old colonial houses that hid behind trees as if they were scared. Soon, the lawns gave way to an ancient wilderness. Oak and maple forests began dominating; squirrels scurried about in their canopy. In the sky, which was just white patches painted on a blue canvas, hawks circled, analyzing the ground below for anything stupid enough to become its prey. Up ahead, I saw a deer that had been run over by a car. It lay flattened on the road, disfigured and dismembered, blood pooled around it, dark and shiny like oil.

Hours passed, and the scenery changed to rolling farmlands, then rolling hills. At 12:30, I decided to stop for a meal at a modest establishment just outside of Pennsylvania. The place smelled of grease and truck drivers. The lady at the counter sat there staring into nothing. I wondered how people spend their lives working in places as solitary as this, with no companions, their only form of entertainment being their own thoughts. Fifteen years ago, one of my engineers confided in me that he no longer found solace in his own thoughts and even felt that his thoughts were destructive. He told me that so many years of working in a profession that doesn’t allow one to get bored had made him unable to cope with his own thoughts. That made me think back to my days as a sheepherder in Washington. The workdays were long and solitary, but I never felt bored. Maybe it was the sweet, sweet energy one has in childhood, or maybe it was the fact that I turned to my own thoughts for entertainment. I would spend the whole day acting out scenes from the newest play or make up entirely new stories with me as the hero. I could also just stare at a bug, give it a name, and imagine it as the hero of its own story.

Me and my friends, when we gather, often find ourselves wondering about why so many of us tend to be so unhappy. Many times have I told them the aforementioned story, but more often than not, they end up laughing as if it’s a joke.

Anyways, the woman behind the counter looked at me with a polite smile that hid disgust for rich folks. I ordered a burger and was determined to make my way out of the establishment as quickly as possible. I saw, through the corner of my eye, rough-looking guys playing poker at a table, and a few were looking at me. I kept my head low and took a seat at an empty table by the window, with a clear view of the exit and the Scioto River in the distance. After a few minutes of the guys not bothering me, I relaxed a bit and looked out of the window into the river—beautiful, calm, and serene, just like the Columbia River by whose banks I spent so many hours. After the passage of a few minutes, the waitress came in with the burger, and I noticed she had a slight limp in her foot. She placed the food on the table. I got the urge to ask her about her limp but decided against it, thinking it would come off as rude. I finished my burger in peace. It was greasy and cheap, but it tasted awfully good and smelled like heaven. The flavours exploded in my mouth and reminded me of home.

When I got up to leave, one of the rough-looking guys got up and walked over to me and cornered me. He had a devious smile on his face and a glazed look in his eyes. He put his hands on my shoulders; they felt heavy and dangerous. He leaned closer to me, his breath smelling of alcohol. He spoke in a low, gravelly, and slurred voice.

“Nice car you got out there, mister. Mind me taking a drive?”

A chill passed through my body, my hairs stood on end, and I could feel my feet beginning to shake.

“Please don’t do such an injustice to an old man.”

He balled his fist, and I thought that this is where I die, flattened like the deer and blood looking around me like tears. But then a wonderful thing happened. As he was about to hit me, he was pulled by another guy who looked like the leader of the group, and the man toppled over like a vase. I took a deep sigh of relief, and my nerves began to calm. The leader handed me a glass of water, looked at the man lying on the ground, and shouted at him.

“We don’t mess with old people unless they mess with us. Do you not remember our most basic rule? Now get up, you bastard, and apologize to this man.”

I took a sip of water; my throat had gone dry without my realizing it. The man got up, struggling to stand straight, and tumbling over his words, said,

“Sor… sorry, gra… gramps.”

I’ve lived in Wilmington for a couple of years now and feel like I’m missing out on trying new things /going out places because I don’t have a solid group/friends here to do things with except my partner (who likes to stay home mostly), people from work (who don’t have similar interests) and my mini schnauzer (who is a senior/old lady that also likes to stay home!!)

My hobbies include

Gaming: Overwatch, Grounded, Phasmaphobia, Palia, BeatSaber/Quest, Overcooked, JustDance, Fortnight (open to trying new games I have pc/quest pro/steam deck/switch) board games I’ve played Uno xD, rise of the tribes, cutthroat caverns, cah, etc. We can start a discord channel.

Crafting: crocheting, sewing (down for some workshops like pottery, paint and sips, candle making, cooking, etc.)

Some things I’d be interested in doing: escape rooms, thrifting, museums, trying new restaurants, concerts (I like rock/metal but any genre is fine) murder mystery dinners, going to the movies, I want to be more active so nature trails/walking and maybe even group fitness, coffee, I’m open to bars but I dont drink much - would go mostly for the social setting. I like cooking for people, exploring the city (Wilmington/philly but I hate driving to Philly lol), when it is warm: group sports like kickball, volleyball, kayaking, lazy river, amusement parks etc. I’m probably forgetting some stuff so open to anything!

1qdjynv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qdjynv/struggling_to_make_a_good_espresso_delonghi/,Struggling to make a good espresso [De’Longhi Dedica and Baratza Encore ESP],"Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice of any kind because I’m feeling very frustrated with the results I’m getting from my coffee shots.

I recently bought the well-known De'Longhi Dedica Style EC685.R manual espresso machine, along with the Baratza Encore ESP grinder and a few additional accessories:

* A high-precision scale
* A coffee distributor

I’m aware that I’m still missing some tools, such as a tamper, a WDT tool, or a dosing funnel, but I’m not sure which of these are truly essential at this stage.

I purchased a specialty coffee in whole beans and tried to learn how to dial it in. For now, I’m using the pressurized basket that came with the machine, but I can’t seem to get good results. I understand that there needs to be sufficient headspace between the coffee puck and the top of the basket so it doesn’t touch the shower screen, and I’ve been careful to respect that. I’ve also made sure the ground coffee is properly distributed before brewing.

I’ve been taking notes of my results, which I’m sharing below:

**TEST 1**

* 51 mm pressurized single-shot basket
* Grind size: 15
* 8 g of coffee

❌ Almost no coffee comes out

**TEST 2**

* 51 mm pressurized double-shot basket
* Grind size: 18
* 18 g of coffee

❌ No coffee comes out

**TEST 3**

* 51 mm pressurized double-shot basket
* Grind size: 22
* 13 g of coffee

✅ Very fast flow = slightly watery, but with a bit of crema (drinkable)

**TEST 4**

* 51 mm pressurized double-shot basket
* Grind size: 20
* 13 g of coffee

✅ Very fast flow = watery and with very little crema

**TEST 5**

* 51 mm pressurized double-shot basket
* Grind size: 18
* 12 g of coffee

❌ No coffee comes out, and all the water stays on top of the puck

I decided to use the double-shot basket because most people seem to recommend it, but I just can’t get the hang of it. I’ve also struggled to find clear tutorials or helpful guidance online for this specific setup.

After several days of overthinking and experimenting, I’m considering buying a non-pressurized basket and trying to learn with that instead. I would really appreciate your help and opinions—any feedback or suggestions would be extremely valuable to me right now. I’m genuinely trying to understand how this world works, but I feel quite lost, and I really don’t want to give up.

1qdjxj7,https://i.redd.it/m3nbrwwonidg1.jpeg,My entire dorm floor got addicted to Flappy Fruit last night and it turned into total chaos 🦅💸,"So, last night was supposed to be a ""study night"" because finals are creeping up, but you know how that goes. 📚 My roommate walks in and shows me this browser game called **Flappy Fruit** . He’s like, ""Bro, I just won 2 SOL off some random guy in a 1v1."" I thought he was capping, but he showed me his phantom wallet transaction. 🤯

Naturally, I had to try. I deposited like 0.5 SOL (basically my coffee budget for the week ☕) and hopped into a 6-player lobby. The adrenaline rush is actually insane. It’s not like those boring tap-to-earn games where you just mindlessly click. You actually have to sweat. 💦 The physics are just like the OG Flappy Bird**,** so if you mess up, you’re done.

Fast forward 2 hours, and we literally have 10 people from our floor crowded into our tiny dorm room. 🏨 We started hosting our own private lobbies, everyone throwing in SOL. It got SO loud when our RA walked in to tell us to shut up... and then he ended up watching for 20 minutes because he couldn't believe we were wagering crypto on a bird game. 😂

It’s honestly the most fun we’ve had in months.

1qdjxey,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qdjxey/the_fastest_way_to_lose_belly_fat_and_why_most/,The fastest way to lose belly fat (and why most people are doing it totally wrong),"Every time summer hits everyone suddenly becomes obsessed with losing “belly fat FAST.” You see it all over TikTok and Instagram: skinny teas waist trainers 10minute ab workouts. Influencers shout about crazy detox diets like it’s the 2000s again. The problem? Most of this stuff is pure nonsense. It’s not your lack of willpower. It’s that you’ve been lied to by people chasing views not science.  

So what is legit when it comes to burning belly fat? After going down multiple rabbit holes of podcasts scientific studies and expert interviews one name kept coming up: Dr. Mindy Pelz. Her approach is getting a lot of attention for one key reason   it’s not centered around caloriecutting or endless cardio.  

This post breaks down what actually works based on the best science out there   and it’s way simpler than you think.The REAL belly fat secret isn’t a supplement or a workout program   it’s insulin sensitivity. That’s what Dr. Mindy Pelz explains over and over in her lectures and book Fast Like a Girl. She’s part of a growing group of researchers and practitioners showing how timing your food may matter more than what you eat.

Here’s the breakdown:

 TimeRestricted Eating (TRE)  
  The basic idea: Eat within an 8hour window fast for 16 hours.  
  Why it works: When you're not spiking insulin constantly your body dips into stored fat. Especially belly fat. A 2020 review in the New England Journal of Medicine found intermittent fasting improved fat oxidation insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral fat.  Dr. Satchin Panda from the Salk Institute showed that even without changing food intake eating within a set window resulted in weight loss and reduced inflammation. Pelz suggests varying fast lengths (sometimes 24hour fasts) to push metabolic flexibility further.
  
 Stop snacking all day  
 Why it matters: Every time you eat insulin rises. Constant grazing keeps your body in fatstorage mode. In Metabolical Dr. Robert Lustig explains how frequent eating and processed carbs increase visceral fat through insulin resistance.  Instead aim for 23 meals no snacks. Give your body time to use fat instead of just storing it.
  
 Focus on metabolic flexibility not calorie burning  It's not just about keto or lowcarb. It's about teaching your body to switch fuel sources easily.   Dr. Mindy emphasizes metabolic switching   training your body to burn sugar and fat. This happens when you combine fasting strength training and nutrient cycling.  A 2019 NIH study led by Dr. Mark Mattson shows how metabolic switching enhances gene expression related to longevity and fat loss.

Other underrated belly fat killers (backed by real science):

 Walk after meals  
Why it works: A 15minute walk postdinner can significantly lower blood sugar spikes according to a study in Diabetes Care.  Helps reduce insulin improves digestion and signals the body to use glucose instead of storing it.

 Lift heavy at least twice a week  
  Muscle is your fatburning tissue.   A 2021 study from Harvard confirmed strength training is directly linked to lower visceral fat even without weight loss.  Combine this with fasting and the results multiply.

 Prioritize sleep (seriously)  
  Less than 6 hours of sleep = 55% less fat loss even if you eat the same. This stat comes from a University of Chicago study where both groups ate the same diet but the sleep-deprived group lost muscle not fat.  Dr. Andrew Huberman also highlights on his podcast how poor sleep disrupts cortisol and insulin, both belly fat generators.

If you're stuck chasing flat tummy teas or starving on 1200 calories stop. Belly fat is hormonal. You can't outcrunch it. You have to teach your body to access stored energy and regulate insulin. That means eating smarter less often and giving your body time to rest and repair.

The good news? This isn’t about perfection. You don’t need to fast every day or give up carbs forever. But once you understand how your body actually stores and burns fat you stop fighting it. Most people are one or two habits away from unlocking real change   and it doesn’t involve suffering.

Start with these:

 Push your first meal later by 23 hours  
 Eat your last meal before 7pm  
 Walk after dinner  
 Lift heavy twice a week  
 Sleep 7+ hours  
 Ditch snacks and drink water/black coffee between meals

Once you stop feeding the fat storage machine results come faster than you think.",1,1768484779.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

**Location:** Brisbane Queen Street and Woolworths

**Energy:** 7 out of 10

**Mood:** I was feeling pretty good today actually. I did have coffee around noon so I didn't take a nap, but I felt positive and pretty energetic. I was a bit nervous to start the day

**Limiting Beliefs:** I'm not good at this, I am too old, I already approached that girl, I can't do it, I should be better at this, I can't help people

**Social Exposure:** 10 approaches, 3 Phone Numbers, 1 Instant Date, 6 Pretty Good Conversations

**Day Summary:**

* I was feeling pretty good today. I actually got to bed early last night and then woke up at 8:30am and got some goals written out and then I did a bit of outreach on Reddit. I ended up going to the coffee shop around noon because I felt it was better to be awake and productive even if it cost me $12 than it would be to take a nap. Because I didn't take a nap I was able to get a some of the International Flirting Document created, I came home and made and IG reel, then I went for a run before going out and doing my approaches
* The approaches today were a bit hit and miss. My very first one was a blonde girl waiting at the bank. She was pretty stylish and pretty cute. I said she had a pretty retro style and she lit up. She was starting her new business account when I met her. I think I could tease longer on the Only Fans joke. I got her age, origin and occupation pretty quick. I went with her for an Instant Date pretty quick in the interaction. She is from Brisbane, but lived in Melbourne for awhile but didn't like it. She was a bit of a party girl so I don't think I would want to see her again. I didn't feel like I was as flirty as I could have been, but I was turned off by the fact one of her hobbies is drinking. I should probably start excusing myself when I see we would not be a match. She was cute though so maybe if she was up for it, I would have pulled her. Either way it was a good lesson and experience
   * Things I did well:
      * Didn't hesitate to do the first approach
      * Got the origin and age very quickly
      * DHV'd my travels and my life
      * I teased her about Aussie's being crazy
* I had another solid interaction with a girl who was walking home from work. She was very excited when I said she looked so relaxed. We talked for a good amount of time and it seemed a bit flirty, but she may have just liked to chat. She mentioned she had a boyfriend so I didn't push the interaction much further. I did make sure to ask where he was and teased her that he wasn't around.
* I had one really good interaction that I liked. She was getting ready to check out of the grocery store and I knew if I didn't open her she would be gone. She seemed to be very receptive to me opening her and she asked me where I was from right away. I believe she was 30 and is working as an office admin. I made sure to tell her she was cute, and I found out she was doing mushrooms this weekend with friends. I haven't heard back from her yet
   * Things I did well:
      * Didn't worry about social pressure and opened the girl at the checkout
      * Got the origin, occupation and age
      * Made sure to go for the close
* The other approaches were ok, but I did feel like I could be doing a lot better overall. Many of the girls I talked to had boyfriends or they were just not that interested in talking to me. I did have a good interaction with a girl as she was finishing up her work. I sent her a message, but didn't hear anything back
* I felt pretty good about my day today, but could also do some more
   * Things I did well:
      * Woke up at 8:45am
      * Did IG Reel Challenge
      * Worked on Flirtation Guide
      * Went for a run
      * Completed 10 approaches
      * Had an Instant Date and got 3 Phone Numbers
      * Sauna

**Biggest Lesson / Takeaway for the Day:**

* Stay present and keep putting in the work. I am in the valley of despair right now, but if I keep up with what I am doing, I will reach a new level.

**What will I work on tomorrow:**

* Create another IG reel and then focus on maintaining eye contact and speaking deeper and slower

**Approaches:**

**1-15-26**

1. 1st approach of the day and was just finishing my filming for the start of the YouTube video. I saw a cute blonde who looked pretty stylish, just sititng outside the bank. I felt pretty good about this set and she was very energetic and seemed to love the interaction. I said she looked like she worked in fashion, and she said she actually just deposited money to start her own business. We talked briefly and then I think it was her who offered the instant date. I was not really looking to go on one since I was just getting started, but I decided it would be good. She is a pretty wild girl from what I could tell. She is 31 and still likes to drink and she mentioned she likes to do coke. She also met a guy recently at a house party and they have gone on three dates. She is pretty cute and I got her WhatsApp, but I don’t really see what the point of meeting up with her would be. She has a bit of a masculine vibe and I don’t party
2. Tried to front stop a cute asian girl. She kept walking and said thanks. She might have never stopped even if my game was better
3. There was a girl seated dressed in white. I said she looked nice and then went into a cold read right away about where she was from. The interaction was clunky as I didn’t have a lot to say. I think I am too hard on myself thinking I should be able to build attraction wiht everyone I open. In reality I was not that attracted to her after I spoke to her. She wasn’t very bubbly or happy and didn’t want to contribute to the conversation. Even if I got her number I would not want to see her. I think everything is working out like it should.
4. Stopped a blonde girl who was wearing a rocker shirt that I saw earlier. She seemed a bit interested at first, but she was also kind of standoffish. I tried to talk to her, but I may not have been very smooth. She ended up just walking away
5. Stopped a girl and said she looked nice. She was super receotive right away. She really liked that I said she looked so relaxed. We had a good vibe and I guess she was just really talkative. She is from Brisbane and she mentioned she had a boyfriend who plays in a band. She was receptive to me calling her cute, but since she was in a relationship I didn’t push it any further. McKenzie has boyfriend who is in a band
6. I was on my way to the grocery store and was going to stop at 6 approaches, but I made eye contact with a tall blonde haired girl. I said I saw her and she mentioned she noticed me as well. She was pretty energetic and flirty. I think I could have maybe gotten her to stay longer, but she did say she had a boyfriend she started dating 2 weeks ago. I was excited for her I guess so I didn’t push for the number at all. IShe seemed really happy to be with the guy
7. Saw a tiny Vietnamese girl as I was going in to the grocery store so I went outside with her and said she looked nice. She was not very receptive and I thought she might be a bit young
8. There was a cute blonde girl who walked to the check out in Woolworth’s. I had no choice, but to open her there if I wanted to talk to her. She was very receptive and was hooked pretty quickly. She is from Brisbane and is working in an office. She is off this weekend to go and do mushrooms with her friends. I thought the interaction was pretty solid and there was some good flirting, but I haven’t heard back from her.
9. Saw a girl in red and was going to open her. She walked right by me, and I didn’t persist because she seemed quite young
10. Opened a girl who was wearing red and was working at the juice bar. She was super cute. I don’t think I did a great job with the interaction, but I did go for a close. I sent her a message, but haven’t heard back",1,1768484774.0,TheUnstoppableMan,0,1.0,False

I'm always looking for high score games to play - brief diversions while I'm out and about. Tobu Tobu Girl Deluxe, a platformer that's easy to pick up but with surprisingly engaging mechanics, fits the bill. It's a little bit like the opposite of Downwell: you bop on top of bats, birds, and octopi, avoiding spikes and traps, going up until you clear the level. You get a triple jump and can move in 8 directions, so it's not all on your reflexes - there's some tactical on-the-fly decision making. To say nothing of the game's adorable aesthetic, colourful spritework, and banger of a soundtrack. Everything is so warm, cheerful, and inviting. I still haven't beaten level 3 yet, but I find myself coming back to it time and again.

It's a GBC game on itch.io, and they generously let you ""Name your price"". A great fit for any of your devices with a square 1:1 aspect ratio, or an 8:7 handheld like Retroid Pocket Classic. For my money, it's well worth the price of a coffee!",4,1768484664.0,SBCGaming,3,1.0,False
1qdjviz,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1qdjviz/the_curious_furious_case_of_a_refund_request_and/,The curious furious case of a refund request and the disappearing return flight,"I’ve had some time to think about the miserable and costly service experience that American Airlines created for me and my family this December. I’ve also reviewed my credit card account to ensure that my statement accurately reflects what did and didn’t happen.

I keep running around in the customer service hell loop, so I’m posting my latest plea below for help from the universe.

As previously stated in several complaints, my family and I set out for a trip to Seattle from DFW on December 26. Our outbound flight was delayed and every passenger had to rush at the last minute to another gate in a different terminal for departure. About an hour in to the flight we were made aware that there was no circulating water so there would be no coffee service. Fine, but just a moment later, the captain announced that we were being diverted to Phoenix to resolve the issue.

We landed in Phoenix and were hurried to a nearby gate where we were told to stay close by and that we would soon be boarding. This went on for about an hour until a missing co-pilot showed up at the gate. We ended up landing at Sea-Tac several hours after our original arrival time, and later on we received a push notification prompting us to request a refund.

I completed requests for myself, my wife, and our kids per this prompt and thought nothing else of it as we enjoyed our trip.

The day before our scheduled departure, we noticed that we hadn’t been prompted to check in for our return flights via the app. My heart sunk when I logged in to see that I had no upcoming trips. It sunk further when a customer service rep informed me that when I requested the refund, it cancelled the second leg of the trip. 

Whoa. At no point in the repetitive and arduous refund request process did I see anything about this action canceling the return of our round trip flight.

The other kicker is that the customer service rep told me that the cancellation also meant that a refund was issued to my credit card. See my above comment about checking my accounts, because that never happened. 

Instead I had to book four new one way tickets at the last minute to get us back home the next day. Travel is inherently stressful, and your system of automated triggers and misleading scripts made it that much worse.

I want my money back, if not for the last minute one way tickets, for the entirety of the purchase. 

And yes, I want it back despite the classist system you’ve developed in your favor. Non-refundable tickets are a sham that seem to give ticket providers the right to treat their customers however they please. 

Please make this right.

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.
I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.
The calendar widget said Thursday.
I remember thinking,
“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”
I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:
“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”
He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.
“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”
He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing.
Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.
They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).
“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.
“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.
Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?
I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”
She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”
The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.
“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”
She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.
The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.
The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.
I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.
I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone. Please tell me tomorrow will be Friday.

1qdjti3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greggs/comments/1qdjti3/tales_of_a_former_employee_pt_1/,Tales of a Former Employee - PT. 1,"TL:DR - Started out happy working in the shops, but inconsistent rules/standards, difficult customers, and a heartless manager were enough to break me down.

I worked about 8 years in total for the company, in both the shops and one of the factories. 

Simply put: my experience was a mixture. I have a handful of good memories including colleagues I worked with and tasks/work I enjoyed doing.

Unfortunately, I had negative experiences and frustrations which mentally outweighed the good, hence why I don't work there anymore. These are experiences that I can't help thinking about to this very day, becuase being neurodivergent makes it difficult to forget some of the shit one has been through, even if they seem trivial.

I'd like to share some stories on here with the hope that 
A) Documenting them helps get the memories off my chest.
B) It might help those who are going through something similar.

We'll begin with my time in the shops. I'll tell three little tales in this post, with more to follow later, let's dive in.. 

I started as a young, naïve 23ish year old who had been on the dole for a while, and was almost jumping with joy when I got the call to say I'd been hired. I'd been volunteering in a charity shop to get retail work experience, and I quite enjoyed it, mostly getting to interact with people, using the till, etc.

The first red flag came shortly after my interview, I was interviewed by the bloke who would be my Area Manager. He was a touch of old fashioned and a bit dry in his demeanor, Scottish as well. I had the tiniest bit of stubble on my face because I didn't like to be clean shaven, and he pointed out that I'd need to keep myself shaved well otherwise I'd have to wear a snood, which I took on board.

After getting the hired call I had to attend an induction, but I read the address wrong from the letter and ended up at the wrong place: a shop. First thing I noticed was a lad behind the counter, maybe a little older than myself, with a great big long beard, and no snood. This puzzled me of course, but at that point I was panicked and trying to get to my induction.

I got to the correct place, slightly late but they were alright about it. And had the induction as normal. When it got to the end and the trainer asked if we had questions, I told him what I had just seen and asked for clarification, his response was a little sort of shrug and saying something to the effect of ""Some Area Managers and shops do it differently"". Well fuck. That didn't sit well with me but I just gritted my teeth and moved on. 

Throughout the rest of my time in the shops: the Area Manager would point out if I had stubble, and at one point implied (outside, while I was taking some rubbish out) my chances of climbing the management ladder in the company wouldn't be great if I didn't keep on top of my facial hair. Despite the fact I was a class worker, always on time, efficient, hard working, he seemed to take issue with any facial hair I had. Of course at the time I just bit my tongue and didn't have it in me to argue, my confidence only went so far and I was scared of losing my job, oh to be young and naïve again. What a twat he was.


Next up: rude/difficult customers. Initially the hustle and bustle of serving people was electrifying, I did it with a smile and spring in my step, treating everyone like a mate I hadn't met.

The first crack that began breaking the illusion was when a lady came in with a voucher for a free sausage roll, she handed it over and I checked to see if it was in date as we had been told to do so. (It's worth noting that I was a stickler for rules in the beginning, as I wanted to get as much right as possible).

Turned out the voucher wasn't in date, my instinct was to call for the Assistant Manager and run it by her. She had a look and basically said ""ah it's okay, we'll just let her have the free one anyways"", which I was quite happy to do. I told the lady she could still have the free one, bagged it up for her and handed it over.

In my mind: I thought we were doing a kind thing that she'd appreciate, bypassing the rules so she can get a free item and avoid disappointment. But she took it and her face sunk. ""I wanted a hot one"" she said disappointedly. In the end she had to wait about ten minutes for a fresh one to come out of the oven, then went about her day. I was slightly taken back cos it wasn't the reaction I was hoping for. Don't get me wrong: she wasn't particularly horrible and wasn't the worst person I'd ever came across, maybe she wasn't having a great day?. But the memory stuck with me, it was my first lesson that sometimes trying to do a good deed doesn't always equal satisfaction, some customers won't - or can't - show appreciation.


Finally: the straw that broke the camels back and caused me to leave the shops.

I was working a closing shift on a cold winter evening with a colleague, and was a Senior Team Member at this point (a promotion I came to regret, but that's for another rant). And so was in charge of closing the shop, sorting the money, etc. 

As we enter the final 30 mins of the shop being open; a customer comes in, orders a coffee etc. and informs us a homeless guy is outside the shop and looking really unwell. With it being the city centre there was a few of them about, but it was rare any of them would set up outside our shop. I thanked the customer and went to check on the guy.

Sure enough he was sat on the ground just outside the doorway, semi-conscious, and reeking of meth. I tried talking to him but he was quite unresponsive, I tried getting him a bottle of water and a hot drink, attempted waking him up again, but he wouldn't budge. He looked worse for wear so naturally: I phoned for an ambulance.

They said they'd be on their way and came about 15/20 minutes later, all the while I stayed with the homeless guy and put one of our spare body warmers on him to try and help. I didn't know him at all but I didn't want him getting really ill. Ambulance came, they checked him out and took him away, never seen him again but I hope he got the help he needed.

Here's the thing: dealing with the homeless guy wasn't the big issue, what came afterwards was.

Because of helping him, it meant some tasks my colleague and me had to do were left unfinished. Because we wanted to get away on time after closing it meant leaving a couple of bins full, some of the floor unswept, and not as much bacon trayed up. It wasn't ideal and I felt bad about having to do it, but I left a note for the manager in the morning explaining what had happened and apologising profusely. After that we locked up and left exhausted and overwhelmed.

The next day, I came in for another closing shift with the same colleague. I walks in and the manager (let's call her Worzel, after the famous TV scarecrow) pulls myself and the colleague into the office and starts furiously lambasting us. Saying how things weren't in proper order that morning and it was unacceptable, despite reading the note I had left her. I tried to make her understand what had happened, how someone needed help after a customer asked. Her response? 

""You should have just left him. It's not our responsibility"" 

I was gobsmacked. Did she really expect me to just leave someone out in the cold who needs medical attention? I couldn't fathom just how heartless she was, as if a human life isn't worth helping because a floor needs swept, and despite the essential work like money being counted etc. 

I was around 3 years into working at the shops by this point, and that incident was the final nail in the coffin, I was checked out and gave very limited fucks despite trying my best. Shortly afterwards I secured a new job at one of the factories closer to where I lived.

That's all for now, feel free to ask any questions.

I am looking into the best coffee franchise opportunities to own and I am trying to figure out what actually works long-term not just what actually looks good on Instagram.

If you have owned one, managed one or seriously researched them, which coffee franchise models seem to perform best and why?

•    Drive-thru only vs café seating vs kiosk/cart setups

•    How much location matters compared to the brand itself

•    What the day-to-day headaches really are (staffing, consistency, food add-ons, morning rush etc)

Also curious what people think: Is a coffee franchise still a solid idea in 2026, or is the market too saturated now with local shops, delivery apps, and convenience stores improving their coffee game?

If you could start over today, would you pick a “pure coffee” concept or one that’s more like coffee + breakfast/sandwitches for higher average ticket?",2,1768484460.0,franchise_opportunity,0,1.0,False

I (32M) was the best man at my sister's (29F) wedding last weekend. For context, my sister is really into wellness and alternative stuff, which is fine, but it can be a lot. She's always pushing herbal teas and crystal energy on me, LOL.

The morning of the wedding, she insisted I drink a ""special smoothie"" she'd made for the wedding party. She said it was for ""grounding our energy"" and ensuring a harmonious day. It was a thick, green concoction that smelled like lawn clippings and despair. I was hesitant, but she looked so excited and said it was her ""gift"" to us. To avoid drama, I chugged it. Big mistake.

About an hour later, during the pre-ceremony photos, my stomach started making sounds that could summon ancient spirits. I barely made it through the group photos before I had to sprint to the bathroom, where I spent the next 45 minutes in pure agony. I missed almost all of the candid shots and the groomsmen's toast. I emerged, pale and weak, just in time to walk down the aisle. Then, during the ceremony, another wave hit. I was mid-way through my ring bearer duty when I had to clench my jaw and make a beeline for the side door, almost tripping the flower girl. I spent the rest of the ceremony in the venue's staff bathroom.

The final blow? In my frantic rush, I knocked over a huge, decorative candle in the bathroom hallway. It splattered hot wax all over the sleeve and back of my very expensive, rented suit. The rental company is charging me a $250 damage fee.

After the wedding, I told my sister that her smoothie caused the disaster and that I think she should pay the $250 suit fee. She got defensive immediately. She said the smoothie was made with ""pure, organic ingredients"" and that my reaction must be due to my ""toxic diet"" of coffee and fast food. She refused to pay a dime, saying I should have ""cleansed"" my system better beforehand. Our mom says I'm overreacting and should just pay it to keep the peace, arguing that I should have politely refused the smoothie.

So, AITA? I feel like if you force a specialty drink on someone and it makes them violently ill, causing them to miss key parts of your wedding and incur costs, you bear some responsibility. My brother says the principle is right, but I should eat the cost (pun intended) because ""it's her wedding.""

//THIS IS NOT MY GAMEPLAY! source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5wGP1rVEig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5wGP1rVEig)

//Pretend he’s shooting through Pinkerton’s, and not random outlaws. AND replace ""Micah!"" With: ""Milton!""

//and that’s all.



((continuing from the end of the video:))

~~revenge, is a FOOLS game..~~

""Milton, If you’re here… come out!""

 The watchtower comes into view through the snowfall.

Old. Wooden. Reinforced with modern steel plates and antennae bolted onto the roof. Someone thought this was a good place to disappear.

John slows.

Too quiet.

He circles once, scanning the treeline. No guards. No lights. Just wind rattling the tower like bones.

“Yeah,” he mutters. “That figures.”

He moves to the door.



Inside, the tower smells of oil, metal, and cold coffee.

Maps are pinned to the walls—satellite printouts, mountain passes marked in red. Radios hum softly on a desk. Someone left in a hurry… or wanted to look like they did.

John steps forward.

The floorboard creaks.

Instinct screams.

He turns—

Too late.



Something slams into his back, sending him sprawling across the room. His rifle skids away. A boot comes down hard on his shoulder.

Milton’s voice cuts through the wind.

“Still charging straight through the front door, Marston.”

John grunts, rolling as the next blow misses his head by inches. He comes up swinging, fist cracking into Milton’s jaw. The man stumbles back but recovers fast, ramming John into the wall.

They grapple, boots slipping on frost-covered wood, years of hatred packed into every movement. Milton fights clean, trained—precise strikes, trying to end it fast.

John fights like a man who’s already buried too many people.

A headbutt. A grunt. A crack as Milton slams into the support beam.

Milton reaches for his sidearm—

John grabs his wrist and drives him down, hard.

The floor shakes.

Milton hits the boards on his back, breath knocked clean out of him.

For a second, neither moves.

Snow blows in through the open doorway.



John stands.

Slowly, he draws his pistol.

Milton looks up at him, eyes wide now—not with fear, but realization. This isn’t a negotiation. There’s no backup climbing the mountain. No system left to hide behind.

John steps forward and raises the gun.

One hand steady.  
Arm locked.  
Body angled slightly sideways.

The pose is unmistakable.

A man who’s walked too far to turn back.

Snow drifts between them. Wind tugs at John’s coat. The mountains loom behind him, silent witnesses.

“Arthur should’ve been the end of it,” John says quietly. “But you just couldn’t let things die.”

Milton swallows, jaw tight.

“You think this fixes anything?”

John’s eyes don’t waver.

“No,” he says. “I think it finishes it.”

The barrel doesn’t shake.

The mountain waits.

**BANG**

Milton’s lifeless corpse collapses to the ground, as John slowly lowers his pistol

""People don’t forget, nothing get’s forgiven…""

He slowly walks out of the watchtower, Milton’s lifeless body left in the cold wooden watchtower.

John stares up to the sky, unsure of what to do next.

""I guess that’s that then…""

He says, as he slowly begins making his way back down the mountain, towards tracen.

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Been thinking a lot lately about what ""peak life"" actually means. It's not some mythical destination, right? More like a continuous unfolding, a series of small, intentional choices that nudge us closer to our best selves.

And the cool part? You don't need a complete overhaul. Sometimes, it's the tiny tweaks that unlock the biggest shifts.

Here are a few simple optimizations that have been working wonders for me lately. Maybe they'll spark something for you too:

*   **The ""5-Minute Rule"" for Action:** Got something you're procrastinating on? Just commit to it for *five minutes*. Often, just starting is the hardest part. Once you're in motion, you'll likely keep going. Big goals broken down into tiny, manageable steps!

*   **Mindful Mornings, Mighty Days:** Before diving into the digital deluge, take just 5-10 minutes for yourself. A quick stretch, a few deep breaths, jotting down *one* thing you're grateful for. It sets a calmer, more focused tone for the entire day.

*   **One ""Yes"" to Yourself Daily:** What's one small thing you can do today *just for you*? It could be listening to a favorite song, stepping outside for fresh air, or reading a few pages of a book. Prioritizing our own well-being is *not* selfish.

*   **The ""Gratitude Glance"":** Throughout the day, consciously notice *one* thing you appreciate. It could be the taste of your coffee, a friendly smile, or the convenience of technology. Training your brain to see the good amplifies it.

It's easy to get overwhelmed by the idea of ""optimizing everything."" But remember, progress over perfection. These are just gentle nudges, not rigid rules.

Sometimes, navigating the ups and downs of personal growth can be a lot. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or just need a safe space to explore your feelings, [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) has been incredibly helpful for many.

What are your go-to ""simple optimizations"" that make a big difference in your life? Would love to hear them in the comments! Let's keep this amazing growth engine humming! 🚀✨🧠🎯",1,1768484048.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1qdjmyb,https://i.redd.it/ztg6erh1nidg1.jpeg,Update on the Favr project (local feedback ended up shaping a lot of it),"A few months back I asked here how people in Luxembourg handle small everyday favours, things like getting something picked up, airport drop-offs, borrowing items, etc.

I’ve been building a platform for this since then, and wanted to share a quick update because the feedback from this sub actually influenced several decisions.

We also ended up partnering with Erasmus networks and student associations both in Luxembourg and outside of it, because students immediately understood the use case (they often need quick help and don’t always have a network here).

We just reached the point where payments are now properly integrated and things are starting to run in the first few cities. It’s nowhere near finished, but it feels like a milestone and I wanted to close the loop here.

1qdjm0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1qdjm0u/9_lifechanging_lessons_you_didnt_learn_in_school/,9 Life-Changing Lessons You DIDN'T Learn in School (Science-Based),"Spent the last 2 years reading 100+ self improvement books, research papers, and listening to countless podcasts because I felt stuck. School taught me calculus but not how to actually function as a human. Wild.

Here's what actually works, backed by science and real experience, no recycled Instagram quote BS:

Your brain literally rewires based on what you focus on

Neuroplasticity isn't just a buzzword. Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains this on his podcast constantly. Your brain physically changes based on repeated thoughts and behaviors. That anxiety loop you're stuck in? It's a neural pathway you've accidentally strengthened. The good news: you can build new ones.

Start small. When you catch yourself spiraling into negative thoughts, interrupt the pattern. Say ""thinking"" out loud. Sounds dumb but it works. You're creating distance between you and the thought. Do this enough and your brain literally forms new connections.

The 5am club myth is garbage for most people

Everyone's chronotype is different. Some research shows night owls forced into early schedules have higher cortisol (stress hormone) levels. Robin Sharma's ""The 5 AM Club"" sells millions but overlooks basic biology. If you're naturally productive at 10pm, lean into that instead of fighting your circadian rhythm.

Track your energy levels for a week. Notice when you actually feel sharp vs when you're just forcing it. Schedule deep work during your natural peaks.

Atomic Habits by James Clear should be mandatory reading

This book genuinely changed how I approach everything. Clear won multiple awards for this, he's a behavior change expert who actually understands habit formation science. The core idea: tiny changes compound into remarkable results over time.

Best trick from the book: habit stacking. After I brush my teeth (existing habit), I do 10 pushups (new habit). After I pour my morning coffee, I write 3 sentences in my journal. You're piggybacking new behaviors onto established ones. Your success rate skyrockets.

This is the best habit book I've ever read and it's not even close. Insanely practical.

Your environment controls you more than willpower ever will

Willpower is finite. Your environment is constant. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows environmental design beats motivation every time. Stop relying on discipline to save you.

Want to read more? Put books on your pillow. Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete apps or move them to the last screen. I started using an app called Ash for relationship and mental health coaching. It sends little prompts throughout the day that actually stick because they're contextual, not random.

Make good choices automatic and bad choices annoying.

The 2 minute rule destroys procrastination

If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. Sounds simple but most people ignore this. Responding to that email, putting dishes away, texting someone back. These tiny incomplete tasks pile up and create mental clutter that drains you.

David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"" breaks this down perfectly. He's basically the godfather of productivity systems. Your brain isn't designed to hold dozens of open loops. Every unfinished task is background processing eating up mental RAM.

Deep work is the most valuable skill nobody teaches

Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" explains why surface level multitasking is killing your potential. The ability to focus without distraction for extended periods is becoming rare, which makes it extremely valuable.

Most people check their phone 96 times per day (research from Asurion). Every interruption requires 23 minutes to fully recover focus (UC Irvine study). You're basically never actually focused.

Block 90 minute chunks. Airplane mode. Close all tabs except what you need. Track how much deep work you actually do per week. Most people vastly overestimate this.

Your self talk literally predicts your outcomes

Dr. Ethan Kross wrote ""Chatter"" about the voice in your head. When you talk to yourself in third person (""You got this"" vs ""I got this""), your brain processes it differently. Creates psychological distance that reduces anxiety.

Athletes do this constantly. LeBron James famously refers to himself in third person during high pressure moments. Sounds weird but the research backs it up.

Also, stop saying ""I'm so bad at this."" Add ""yet"" to the end. ""I'm bad at public speaking yet."" Your brain hears possibility instead of permanence.

The people around you determine your trajectory

You become the average of the 5 people you spend most time with. Not metaphorically, literally. Emotions are contagious (proven via fMRI studies). Habits spread through social networks like viruses.

If everyone around you is stagnant and comfortable, breaking out requires insane energy. If you're surrounded by people leveling up, their standards become yours automatically.

Join communities aligned with who you want to become. Online counts. Reddit, Discord servers, wherever. Proximity matters less than shared values and goals.

Most self improvement fails because people try changing everything at once

Research shows people who try multiple behavior changes simultaneously have a 2-10% success rate. Focus on ONE thing until it's automatic, then add another.

The compound effect is real but only if you actually stick with something long enough to see it.

Look, school taught us mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell but not how to manage stress, build habits, or think clearly. These books and resources filled those gaps for me. Your mileage may vary but the underlying principles are solid.

Start with one thing. Any of these. See what happens.",1,1768483984.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

1qdjjac,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1qdjjac/why_do_you_still_have_this/,"""Why do you still have this?""","My husband went in to we'll call it ""Hospital A"" for open heart surgery. Two days later, he was taken by ambulance to ""Hospital B"" (higher tier/more post op support) where 3 weeks later, he ultimately succumbed to complications following the surgery.

In the hours following his surgery, he was still at Hospital A (in the ICU). They gave me a little brochure with ""what you need to know"", contact phone numbers, etc.

That brochure has literally been on my nightstand for nearly 5 months now. Collecting proverbial dust.

My daughter came into my room as she was getting ready for school this morning, for some reason her eye was drawn to it, she picked it up and asked me ""why do you still have this?""

I don't know why I still have the brochure from the hospital where he had his surgery. But every time I look at it I just feel like it just belongs on my nightstand exactly where it is.

I don't know why I still have not returned the library books that I took out a few days before his operation. I brought one with me every day to the ICU thinking I'd sit in quiet and peace in his room and read. Learning after the fact that his stay in the ICU would be anything less than calm and peaceful for the most part. I know the book covers and titles by heart (there are like 5 of them).  For months one of them sat on a little table in the front room, waiting for me to sit in calm and reflective quiet and read it. That time hasn't come yet. Do I not want to let go of them because they are from ""before""? I really don't know.

I don't know why I still have his coffee cup sitting out on the Keurig. Even when we've entertained - I take it off to make coffee for guests and then put it back when everyone leaves.

My husband had blepharitis and so needed to wipe his eyes with a special wipe every morning when he woke up. I don't know why the wipe he'd set out for the day after he'd come home from surgery is still on his nightstand, on top of 2 books he'd been reading. 

I don't know any of this.

1qdjijt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qdjijt/not_sure_if_interested_or_not/,Not sure if interested or not,"Not exactly sure how to flair this since it’s half a vent but I’d actually appreciate some advice.

Just some background, I’m 24f and haven’t had a real longterm relationship my whole life. I’ve grown-up being called ugly and bullied so I’ve never seen myself really having a shot. Like situations where people would loudly proclaim they would never find me attractive without prompting from me. I’ve never been wanted romantically, I’ve always been sort of invisible in that way. I’ve tried dating apps, went on dates I thought were successful but either never developed chemistry or got ghosted.

I’ve tried being the pursuer and asking guys out, but it inevitably falls apart for lack of interest from the other person. It would always end up with me making an effort to schedule dates and see the other person, or texting to check up on them, and they respond to be nice but there’s no actual effort on their part to see me or get to know me even in a casual sense. I eventually take the hint and stop texting and making plans because I hate feeling like I’m forcing them. I deleted dating apps and just accepted that I’ll probably be single for a long while, if not forever.

Recently I’ve started talking to someone I knew from high school, we had followed each other on Insta for while but hadn’t much interacted after graduating. We reconnected and hung out. At first I just wanted to expand my close social circle a bit so I had more than two people to hit up if I wanted to go somewhere, but where we recently went (museum) could easily be mistaken for a date. I’ve wanted to see a particular exhibit for a long time but couldn’t convince anyone to go with so he agreed to go with me. Here’s the part I need help with. He paid for the exhibit I wanted to see and I thanked him, he said it was no problem and it was an apology for being late and making me wait. He did some other things that I saw as friendly/platonic later but I’m unsure if this is because of my past with dating that I’m seeing it that way.

I’m afraid I’m doing what I’ve always done in the past though, I have a hard time reading people when it comes to romance and my dating history (or lack thereof) has made it harder. He’s not a huge texter but when I do message he’s always eager to respond and matches my energy. The second time we saw each other to grab some coffee it was his idea, but again that could be entirely platonic. I feel like I didn’t even question how he felt about me until the museum. I invited him to go to a stargazing thing the city is hosting and we’ll see each other then. I should just ask him when we do but I’m terrified I’m misreading things, and he just wants to be polite. I have such a hard time thinking anyone would like me in a romantic way, but I don’t want an opportunity to pass me by. I’d be open to dating him, we share interests, he’s passionate about the same things I am, and I think he’s handsome. I just don’t know how to approach this without blowing up a friendship.

1qdjggu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qdjggu/i_woke_up_and_the_weekend_was_erased_thats_not/,I Woke Up and the Weekend Was Erased. That's Not the Worst Part.,"

I’m typing this from the driver's seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.
I am exhausted, and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.
The calendar widget said Thursday.
I remember thinking,
“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”
I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happened, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since. Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:
“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”
He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.
“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”
He just stared. He chuckled, thinking I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Brianna next. Same thing.
Ryan, the developer guy. Priya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Street for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.
They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the Biblegate app. I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).
“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.
“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. Same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.
Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?
I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”
She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”
The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.
“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”
She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office, and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.
The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.
The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon. I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.” I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.
I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.
I’m scared. But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

found two good budget options, hope they help: 

this haden one is super beginner friendly, makes a good latte cup and the machine itself looks cute. No extra fancy features. Also the temp control with this is pretty much the best compared to the rest in the same tier. 

Now this aiden one is just the upgraded version of the haden but its also pricier so youd have to stretch the budget a bit. With this one tho you can literally fine tune each specific feature and do extra stuff like schedule a brew or add flavours n all through the app. So the taste is ofc then a bit more improved.

1qdje0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qdje0c/aitah_for_getting_mad_at_my_friends_for_ditching/,AITAH for getting mad at my friends for ditching me,"So to start, I have a circle of friends composed of six people (me included). One of them—let’s call her Rachel—is my BFF. I tell her everything. I mean, we all talk as a friend group, but me and Rachel are the closest. I’ve been very open to her in the leading months about my anxiety and my worries.

One day, one of our friends (let’s call her Justin) said we should do an Aguinaldo Mass—it’s basically a Catholic mass at 4 a.m. I’m a closeted atheist, so I said yeah, because it would also give us a reason to hang out after. Rachel, Justin, and one other friend, Vince, all said yes.

At this point, it’s like 7 p.m. and I was so burnt out because we had finals two days before. I was like, ""Whatever, I’m just gonna drink coffee and not sleep because I have to get up at 3 a.m. anyway."" So I stay awake. Me and Rachel have been messaging random updates to see if we're still awake. 3 a.m. comes and I message the GC to see if they’re up; all three of them replied, so I thought it was all good.

I get ready to head out. Me and Rachel had talked about me picking her up, so I walked to her house. I was calling her phone, but she wasn’t picking up—this was typical since she only had a PC, no phone. I arrive at her house and see the light is on, so I’m like, ""Cool."" I call for her and her brother answers the door. I ask if Rachel is there and he says, ""Did y'all message each other beforehand?"" I said yeah, but she’s not answering now. He says, ""Hold on,"" checks, and comes back saying she’s probably asleep because her room is locked.

At this point, I’m pissed. I tried calling the other two, Vince and Justin, and both go unanswered. I decided to go to Vince’s house—it’s a good 15-minute walk. I arrive and her house has a BIG front gate with no doorbell. I knew I couldn’t scream for her since it was 4 in the morning. I give up. Her house is next to the beach, so I went to the beach and sent Rachel a VERY strongly worded message, which I’ll admit went a bit far, but whatever.

I decided—and I was not in the right state of mind—to screenshot our GC and put it in a Google Drive. I was gonna post it on my story, but I stopped myself. I decided to just leave the GC, go home, and sleep.

When I woke up, Justin had messaged me saying she was sorry and she didn’t have data. I saw I was added back to the GC, and the only answers I got were from Rachel (""My dad told me I couldn’t go and turned off my PC"") and Vince (""There was no water in the house, I couldn't take a bath""). Mind you, this was in the GC, NOT even a private message.

I was like, ""Whatever."" We were on Christmas break, so I just decided to ignore them. I deactivated Instagram, and honestly, that incident really made me go into a depressive spiral. I couldn’t get out of bed because my friends were really the ones I was clinging to—and Rachel knew that. She was the ONLY person who knew I was clinging to our friends for support. For them to break my trust like that really put things into perspective.

Flash forward to when we go back to school. I was the first one there. Vince comes up to me and decides to be all ""Oouuu, I’m sorry."" It was more of a joking tone, definitely not serious. I shrugged and slapped her hand away. Mind you, it’s been weeks and that’s all she has to say to me? And Rachel didn’t even speak a single word to me.

So I just ignored them. I only talked to the other three members, including Justin, because she actually had the guts to say sorry to me. I talked to them about how I felt about the entire situation and they sided with me.

Thursday night comes and Vince messages me asking what happened and saying she’s sorry. I said if you two had said sorry that day, I don’t think this would’ve happened, but they really showed no remorse. We talked, so I thought all was good. But the next day, I slowly realize that all of them are icing me out. I stopped talking to them and started talking to the other group (who were formerly our rivals, but we made up).

It all came to a head on Tuesday. I messaged them asking if we could talk and they said yes. We talked, and rachel said ""I apologize"" in the most monotone voice anyone has ever spoken. She said that I was doing ""demented behavior"" and that she was crying because she felt so isolated from the group—and that it was MY fault. and She said the reason the group was icing me out was because I told the group I had a Google Drive of screenshots, and she used the term ""blackmail."" Mind you, I have never once in my life threatened anyone with it.

She also claimed I hurt them physically (me hitting her hand). Honestly, I think that's fair after all the emotional damage. She was super defensive and said, ""I don’t think I can be friends with you."" LOL.

After all that nonsense, I asked Justin if we could walk home because I still wanted to talk. Vince actually apologized and said her piece. That night, I left the GC.",2,1768483412.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

I maintained my exact same morning routine. I would wake up, make coffee, and sit at my laptop on time, as if I were logging in. I would tell my roommate that I was swamped with an important project. I would even go into the empty room to make fake client calls. All the while, I was applying for new jobs with all my energy. To complete the act, I even posted vague updates on LinkedIn about finishing an important Q4 initiative.

The crazy thing is, the plan worked. A recruiter slid into my DMs on LinkedIn, said she was impressed with my recent profile activity, and asked if I was open to new opportunities. Of course, I said yes. I went through their entire interview process, making up stories about my current responsibilities. I breezed through the interviews.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, many people are seeking the perfect mix of modern convenience and small-space living. 1 bedroom barndominiums are rising in popularity because they combine the charm of rustic style with sleek, modern designs. With innovative floor plans, these unique homes offer everything you need in a cozy and functional space. Let's explore the exciting features and ideas behind modern barndominium layouts.

### Why Choose a 1 Bedroom Barndominium?

A 1 bedroom barndominium provides a variety of benefits that make it an appealing option for many. Here are a few reasons why you might consider one:

- **Cost-Effective:** Smaller spaces typically cost less to build and maintain, allowing you to save money.
- **Efficient Use of Space:** Carefully designed floor plans maximize every square foot without sacrificing comfort.
- **Quick Construction:** Barndominiums often have shorter build times compared to traditional homes.
- **Low Maintenance:** The materials used in barndominiums are durable, resulting in less upkeep over the years.

### Creative Floor Plan Concepts

When considering innovative 1 bedroom barndominium floor plans, several standout concepts can elevate your living experience.

#### Open-Concept Layout

One popular choice is an open-concept design. This layout combines the living, dining, and kitchen areas into one large space. The benefits include:

- **Increased Natural Light:** Fewer walls mean more windows, allowing for a brighter home.
- **Versatile Design:** You can easily rearrange furniture and decor to suit your taste.
- **Perfect for Entertaining:** friends and family can interact while cooking or enjoying meals together.

#### Lofted Space

A lofted area within your barndominium adds both charm and functionality. Consider these perks:

- **Extra Storage:** Utilize the loft for seasonal items or personal belongings.
- **Unique Aesthetic:** A loft gives your home an architectural focal point with high ceilings.
- **Flexible Living Options:** For guests, a loft can serve as an ideal sleeping area.

#### Function-Driven Design

Focus on creating spaces designed for your lifestyle. Incorporate multipurpose areas, such as:

- **Work-From-Home Nook:** A small desk can fit seamlessly into a corner of your living area.
- **Expandable Dining Space:** A foldable table can be tucked away when not in use.
- **Outdoor Connectivity:** Install large sliding doors that open to a patio, creating an extension of your living space.

### Modern Features to Include

To enhance your small barndominium, consider integrating modern features that align with your aesthetic and practical needs. Here are some popular additions:

- **Sustainable Materials:** Use eco-friendly building materials to reduce your carbon footprint.
- **Energy-Efficient Appliances:** Invest in appliances that conserve energy and lower utility bills.
- **Smart Home Technology:** Incorporate smart systems for lighting, security, and temperature control.

### Bringing Your Vision to Life

Creating your ideal 1 bedroom barndominium starts with envisioning how the space will function for your needs. Think about your lifestyle and which features matter most. You may even want to consult with an architectural designer who specializes in barndominiums to help bring your ideas to fruition.

Remember that every detail counts. From the exterior finish to the interior layout, every choice shapes your barndominium experience. A well-planned 1 bedroom layout can transform your space into a stylish retreat that feels both modern and cozy.

Finding the right floor plan is the first step towards your dream barndominium. Embrace the opportunity to craft a small yet functional living space that reflects your personal tastes.

Maximizing Space and Functionality in Barndominium Living
---------------------------------------------------------

Living in a barndominium offers a unique blend of style and functionality, making it a popular choice for modern homeowners. With its expansive open spaces and robust structure, a barndominium provides an excellent canvas to maximize your living area. Whether you're looking for a cozy 1-bedroom design or larger configurations, clever planning can significantly enhance both space and utility.

### Understanding Your Space

The first step to maximizing space is understanding how you plan to use your barndominium. Ask yourself:

- What are my daily activities?
- Do I work from home?
- How often do I entertain guests?
- What storage needs do I have?

By identifying these factors, you can create a floor plan that caters specifically to your lifestyle, allowing for a seamless flow in your living area.

### Open Concept Layout

Barndominiums often feature an open concept design that removes unnecessary walls and partitions. This layout creates a spacious feeling, making interiors appear larger and more inviting. Here are some benefits:

- **Enhanced Natural Light:** Without walls blocking light sources, spaces feel brighter and more airy.
- **Functional Zones:** Open plans allow for versatile spaces where living, dining, and working can coexist comfortably.
- **Easy Movement:** A lack of barriers facilitates spontaneous gatherings, making it easier to entertain guests.

To achieve an effective open layout, consider how furniture arrangement can define different zones without the need for walls.

### Smart Storage Solutions

In smaller barndominiums, storage can often be a challenge. Utilizing every nook and cranny is essential. Here are some clever storage ideas:

- **Built-in Shelving:** Install shelves that extend from floor to ceiling to maximize vertical space.
- **Under-bed Storage:** Use the space under your bed for boxes, bins, or drawers, keeping your bedroom tidy.
- **Multi-functional Furniture:** Choose furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes, such as an ottoman that doubles as storage or a coffee table that can convert into a dining table.

These simple changes can make a substantial difference in how spacious and organized your barndominium feels.

### Functionality and Modern Design

Designing your space with function in mind doesn’t mean sacrificing style. Incorporate modern design elements that prioritize functionality, such as:

- **Energy-efficient Appliances:** Invest in appliances that save space and consume less energy while still delivering excellent results.
- **Smart Home Features:** Consider integrating smart technology that can control lighting, temperature, and security with ease, making your life more convenient.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** A clean design with fewer decorative items creates an uncluttered visual look, enhancing the perception of space.

Combining these functional elements with modern design principles will elevate your living experience.

### Outdoor Living Areas

Don’t forget to extend your living space outdoors. Barndominiums often come with ample land, providing the ideal backdrop for outdoor areas. Consider adding:

- **Covered Porches:** Create a comfortable outdoor space where you can relax and enjoy nature.
- **Patios or Decks:** These areas can serve as additional entertainment spaces for gatherings with family and friends.
- **Gardens:** Use landscaping techniques to enhance your outdoor space, adding beauty and providing fresh produce.

Utilizing outdoor spaces effectively can greatly increase your overall living area, making your barndominium feel larger and more versatile.

Ultimately, maximizing space and functionality in a barndominium comes down to thoughtful planning and smart design choices. By creating an open layout, incorporating smart storage solutions, and using modern functionality, you can transform a simple barndominium into a dream home that not only meets your needs but also showcases your lifestyle. With these strategies in place, your barndominium will stand out as a modern haven of comfort and efficiency.

### Conclusion

Choosing a 1 bedroom Barndominium floor plan offers a unique opportunity to embrace innovative, small, and modern designs that fit today’s lifestyle. These structures not only provide a cozy living environment but also exemplify functional design strategies that maximize space. With an emphasis on open layouts, multi-purpose rooms, and smart storage solutions, these floor plans encourage efficient living without sacrificing comfort or style.

The excitement of Barndominium living lies in the adaptability of these designs. You can easily personalize your space to reflect your tastes while enjoying the benefits of a minimalist lifestyle.

•Run shuru hone se pehle hi 20-30 log stretching ke naam pe Instagram reels bana rahe hain. “Squad goals” caption ke saath posing like they just ran Boston Marathon (actual run: 2.5 km slow jog + 500m walk).

• Serious runners 5-6 log hi hote hain jo pace maintain karna chahte hain. Baaki sab? Social butterfly mode ON. Ladkiyan aati hain Lululemon/Decathlon dri-fit mein, ladke Under Armour/Nike pehen ke “pace partner” dhoondh rahe hain (read: number lene ke liye).

• Run khatam hote hi plan: “Guys Starbucks/Cafe Coffee Day/ third-wave overpriced filter coffee pe chalte hain!” Fir wahan 2 ghante baith ke flirting, networking (job switch ki baat), aur “bro you should try my startup” wala gyaan.

• Actual running? Jhat bhar. Max 20-30 mins agar lucky hue toh. Baaki time photo ops, group selfies, “who’s single here” subtle vibes.

Bhai, yeh run club nahi, premium Tinder/ Bumble event hai early morning edition. Desperate logo ka new hunting ground. Ladke aate hain hoping “aaj toh milegi koi fit one”, ladkiyan aati hain “cute runner guys milein” ya free coffee ke liye.

Agar serious running chahiye toh solo jaao ya kuch OG groups join karo.

Here's why.,"Spent 3 months ""validating"" my first SaaS idea. Had 40 coffee chats, sent 100 surveys, analyzed competitors for weeks. Finally built it after all that validation. Launched, got 12 signups, 0 paid. All that validation was worthless because people lie in interviews about what they'd pay for.​

Second product I did the opposite. Had an idea Monday, built ugly MVP by Friday using a boilerplate, launched it Tuesday across 15 directories. Got 34 signups in week one, 4 paid immediately at $19/month. No validation, just shipped and let the market decide. Real money is the only validation that matters.

The problem with validation: people tell you what sounds good, not what they'll actually pay for. They say ""yeah I'd use that"" to be polite, then ghost when you launch. Market validation through real launches beats conversation validation every time. Build fast, launch faster, pivot based on actual behavior not promises.​

This goes against every startup book, but I've launched 5 products now. The 2 that worked had minimal validation and fast launches. The 3 that failed had months of validation and careful planning. Speed beats perfection because you learn from real users, not imagined ones.

Use boilerplates so you're not rebuilding auth for 2 weeks. Ship the core feature in 5 days. Launch everywhere immediately. You'll know in 2 weeks if it's worth pursuing based on who actually pays, not who says nice things in interviews. Found this fast-launch approach studying founders in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) who shipped 10+ products winners launched weekly, losers validated monthly.​

I often feel fullness in the diaphragm, abdomen, or even chest (hard to pinpoint).
Sometimes I can't fully yawn (the yawn stops mid-breath).
The symptoms are variable – sometimes I manage to take a full breath, sometimes not. Normal breaths are fine. The problem mainly concerns deep breaths/breathing.

Sometimes I experience a feeling of tension or burning in the area from the waist up (mainly on the back of the body), which can go away after drinking water (it can even wake me up at night). This sometimes happens two days in a row, and sometimes once every 2-3 weeks.

Sometimes I experience a feeling as if my chest is literally ""holding my breath in for 1-2 seconds.""
Slight dizziness – sporadic.
Physical activity:
I run regularly, 10–14 km (approximately 50-60 km a week) sometimes even 20 km+ in training when I have a better day and the symptoms are less severe, but I usually always take it easy.
I used to run 14 km at a 4:40 pace every run, but now 10 km is tedious and more tiring mentally and immediately physically because of the breathing.
My overall performance is preserved, although running is less enjoyable and I feel like quitting because of the breathing.
The beginning of a run can be the hardest, then it sometimes stabilizes.
The symptoms don't increase over the months.
Sometimes I feel pain in the upper left side of my chest during a run when I try to take deep breaths (around my heart, which is also where my heart is pounding), but it fades over time and doesn't recur until the end of the run, even though I don't slow down or stop, and my heart rate doesn't increase.
For a month now, I've been having popping pain in my chest in the middle of the left side when I wake up and stretch, or when I lie propped up on my arm and read a book, and even when I get out of bed. Bathtub
Tests:
Holter ECG – OK
Holter blood pressure – OK
Lung X-ray revealed nothing.
Range of chest motion is normal according to the physiotherapist.
Heart rate at rest and during training is normal (I use a Polar chest strap). According to my watch, my VO2 max is excellent, at maximum.
Other things:
I have a hunchback, a forward head posture, an anterior pelvic tilt, and a slight asymmetry of my spine and shoulder blades.
Coffee seems to exacerbate the symptoms in the short term, and sometimes I feel like my breathing is rougher shortly after drinking coffee.
I'm not losing weight, I've even gained weight, but I'm more tired on a daily basis.
The problem itself is a significant source of stress because it's difficult to ""ignore."" It's the most annoying thing and it doesn't let me focus on anything else while running. I fell in love with running and it helped me curb my smoking habit, and because of this ""illness"" I finally quit and I haven't used any stimulants for almost 5 months, even though I struggled with addictions for 5 years, and it helps me mentally. I still want to train like I used to and I can't wait for it every day until I run and I get mentally exhausted again because of this feeling.",2,1768481852.0,AskHealth,0,1.0,False

I just spent a month looping through Southeast Asia, and I have to say something that might upset the die-hard Thailand fans: If you are a budget traveler in 2024, Thailand is no longer the king. Vietnam has taken the throne.

I’m starting a 3-part series to break down exactly why I think Vietnam is currently the superior travel destination. Today, in Part 1, we are talking strictly about Logistics and Money.

Everyone says Thailand is cheap, but after crossing the border, I realized Vietnam offers a ""luxury"" experience on a ""backpacker"" budget in a way Thailand just can't match anymore. Here is the reality check.

1. The ""Hostel"" Upgrade: Goodbye, Wet Sock Smell 🏨 In places like Bangkok or the islands (looking at you, Koh Phi Phi), the budget accommodation scene feels like a race to the bottom. I remember handing over $25 USD for a bunk bed in a dorm that smelled distinctly like wet socks and regret. To get a private room with AC? You’re looking at double that.

Then I arrived in Ninh Binh (Tam Coc), and my jaw hit the floor. For $18 USD a night, I wasn't in a dorm. I booked a private bungalow at a homestay. I’m talking about a massive bed, a private balcony, and breakfast included. I woke up, opened my curtains, and saw those insane limestone karsts right outside my window.

The logic is simple: Vietnam’s hospitality market is fiercely competitive right now. Homestay owners are fighting for reviews, so they are driving prices down while pumping the quality up. In Thailand, you pay for the location. In Vietnam, you pay for the experience, and the value for money is just unbeatable.

2. The Transport Game: ""Business Class"" on a Budget 🚌 If you’ve backpacked Thailand, you know the pain of the ""Minivan Mafia."" You’re crammed into a Toyota Commuter with 15 other people, your knees are hitting your chin, and the driver thinks he’s in Fast & Furious.

Vietnam has completely changed the game with the ""Limousine Sleeper Bus.""

I took a trip from Hanoi to Sapa for roughly $12. I expected a normal bus. What I got was a fully reclining leather seat (almost a bed), my own USB charging ports, free water, and privacy curtains. I literally slept like a baby and woke up in the mountains. To get that level of comfort in Thailand, I’d have to book a private taxi or a flight, which would cost 5x to 10x more. It felt like business class on wheels.

3. Digital Nomad Paradise (Connectivity) 📶 For those of us who need to stay online (vloggers, remote workers, or just Instagram addicts), this is huge.

In Vietnam, I picked up a SIM card at the airport for about $10. That gave me 4GB of data PER DAY for a whole month. And the coverage? Insane. I was on a boat in the middle of Ha Long Bay, surrounded by thousands of islands, live-streaming to my friends back home without a single second of lag.

It makes the logistics of travel so much easier. You are never lost, never disconnected, and you don’t have to hunt for dodgy café Wi-Fi just to check your maps.

👇 The Bottom Line: I love Thailand; it has a special place in my heart. But right now, my wallet loves Vietnam way more. You get higher quality food, better sleep, and smoother transport for significantly less money.

Stay tuned for Part 2, where I’m going to argue why Pho and Egg Coffee beat Pad Thai and Chang Beer. (Yes, I said it).

I've been following that for years.  I make a 8 cup pot of coffee every morning and I put half a cup (8 tbsp) of coffee grounds in the filter.  (side note : 8 cups x 6oz = 48 oz but the 8 marker on my Bunn coffee pot is something closer to 36oz... weird...)

But I measured that half cup for the first time last night and it came out to like 28g of coffee (zero-ing out the scoop first).  James' video says 60g / 1L is his preferred or correct ratio?

Really nice medium blend with that typical dark chocolatey biscuit taste.

I then tried these from Horsham. I expected the taste between the two be similar but the Horsham tastes surprisingly brighter. Not what id usually expect from a darker roast. Not similar at all really. Both are blends. I suppose  maybe sweeter but id say bright is a better description. Sort of what youd expect in a lighter roast.

I ordered an 18"" laptop with a 5060 Mobile graphics card (and an AMD Ryzen 7 260 + 32GB RAM).

I've browsed dozens of subreddits, but my question remains:

To maximize immersion in games, I'd like a large screen, and I don't have many options here.

Would a 38"" monitor with a 1440p 160Hz refresh rate be better, or a larger 4K TV screen? 32 ok 38"" looks really small 



I know that depending on the game, the GPU will be a bottleneck at 1440p or 4K, but I play very few AAA titles and I took a 10-year break from gaming, so I'm used to the Xbox One on a giant 1080p screen or old-school PC gaming at 20 FPS, haha.

I don't know if I'll notice the difference between 60 and 120 FPS, and I have no problem playing AAA titles on medium settings.

I really want to prioritize immersion, and the monitor will be moved to a coffee table in front of my sofa when I want to use it (and I can position it at 110cm or 150cm if needed). What are your recommendations?

I can still remember being a kid in school and reading my first scary story. From that moment on, I was hooked. I looked for these stories, fiendishly, and, very quickly, they became the only thing circling my brain *constantly*.

Naturally, once I discovered this form of expression, it was only a matter of time before I tried my hand at it myself. 

I felt I had a general grasp on what a good story should look like; pay attention to pacing, make things natural, and, most importantly, *finish* it. 

That being said, I recently wrote a story regarding murder. More specifically, the murder of an elderly jogger who just so happened to be a key witness in the story. 

He was set to testify against some important people, and I was tasked with tying up loose ends, if you know what I mean. 

I was trying to write a crime novel but I’m not Agatha Christie, I just figured I’d give some mystery writing a try. 

I’m getting sidetracked. 

Basically, while he jogged his normal route, as he did every morning; I drove up a mile ahead and set up some thin metal wire that stretched from one tree to another across the path. Directly at neck level…

I wrote my character as this sort of private eye/ mercenary type…thing- listen, I already told you, I’m not Agatha Christie. 

Anywho, I say this because I made him do research, right? I made him know his stuff, is all.

More specifically, I made him know that this jogger jogged at an average pace of 5 miles an hour and that his jugular would be exactly 5 feet and 4 inches from the ground. 

All that “knowing” I did, yet, as I watched the jogger slam into the wire and get clotheslined to his butt, the blood wasn’t coming out at nearly the speed I thought it would. 

In fact, the jogger just sat there, rubbing his neck and becoming absolutely flabbergasted as he drew his hand back from his throat and saw the watery, red blood coating his palm.

In a state of animalistic fear after noticing the wire, his eyes darted around wildly as he rose to his feet. 

Afraid of my target's escape, I quickly jumped from the bush where I hid, waiting to snap a picture of his corpse once the job was completed. 

His eyes lit up with fear as I knocked him down to his back, quickly analyzing the area to make sure no one was around. 

As the old man struggled, I unhooked the wire from one of the trees and wrapped it around his neck. 

I pulled as hard as I could and heard flesh tearing and veins ripping as the man's struggling grunts turned to gurgles, and the sound of running shoes seizing against concrete filled the air. 

Once his feet stopped kicking and his body went completely limp, I removed the wire from his neck. He was nearly decapitated as he lay there on the vacant trail. 

The sounds of nature continued. Birds sang to the backdrop of gently trickling water from a nearby stream as the man's blood leaked further and further down the concrete path.

As I said, my character had to take photos upon the job's completion, so that’s what he did.  

I snapped a few shots from various angles before rolling up the wire and hurrying back to my old Volkswagen, covered head to toe in blood.

Again, I AM NOT A MYSTERY WRITER. 

Like, I didn’t even begin to think about all the DNA evidence that’d be collected from the scene, the amount of witnesses that would’ve been around in such a public space, and don’t even get me started on the fact that he just, what? Left the old man there on the trail for people to find and report? Pick a lane right? 

That’s exactly what I thought too. 

And that’s exactly why I DELETED that story. Moved it to the trash bin immediately after reading it, utterly ashamed of myself, I must say. 

I 100 percent planned on just calling it a night, and picking up on a new story the next day; one that I felt confident in. 

As I lay in bed, drifting into sleep, it felt as though my eyes were closed for mere moments before the booming sound of knocks came thumping from my front door. Sunlight filled my room, and as I groggily made my way towards the door, the rhythmic knocking abruptly stopped. 

When I opened the door, there was no one there, not even in the hallway. 

However…there were some Polaroid photos placed carefully on my welcome mat.

They were of the old man, exactly how I’d imagined him and exactly how I’d mutilated him. All taken from the exact angles as from the story.

I couldn’t move for a brief moment as I stared down at them, disgusted at how they decorated the mat.

I quickly gathered my thoughts and scooped up each of the 6 photos. 

Lying them out on the coffee table, I sat on the couch with a “this can’t possibly be happening” look on my face, and my head fell into my hands as the realization hit me. 

Flipping on the TV, I turned to the news just in time to see the headline:

KEY WITNESS IN RICO CASE FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED ON PARK TRAIL IN ATLANTA

“Welp,” I thought to myself. “It was fun while it lasted.” 

Look, I’m writing this now because I’m not sure when my next story will be. I can hear the tactical boots of a SWAT team rushing up the stairs in my building, and I’m sure I know exactly where they’re headed.

I have no more to say, other than thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed.

It all started with a single couch that I inherited from a friend in 2015 \[who turns out knew there was a problem with it and chose to say nothing\] and spiraled out into thousands and thousands of dollars worth of furniture, pesticides and other various treatments. 

I struggle with dry skin and also psoriasis, so for weeks/months after I got that couch and then moved to a new apartment, I chalked it up to just that. 

Boy was I wrong. 

About 6 months or so after moving into my new apartment in 2015 I woke up one day and found one crawling underneath me that was full of blood and my ultimate fears were confirmed. The best part? That’s still the ONLY one I’ve EVER seen. 

I immediately dove head first into trying to learn as much as I could about how to fight them; only to realize it’s nearly impossible. 

I bought Cimexa, I bought and used Crossfire. Mattress protectors, and passive monitors. 

Months turned into years, and I don’t have any doubts that I re-infested myself multiple times over, possibly out of laziness or doubt but most likely because it’s one of the most evasive bugs on earth. 

Around 2022 I tried to purge my bedroom of everything I owned: my bed, bed frame, nightstand, coffee table and dresser were all replaced simultaneously and I rented a rug doctor to clean the carpet. I also mixed and sprayed Crossfire in the entire room and within days of doing all of that the bites returned. 

Same thing up until the end of 2024 when my significant other and I decided to finally move in with  each other. I thought this will finally be it; a fresh start. New everything. Treat everything. 

We moved in in December of 2024, after toting all of our nic nacks with Nuvan strips and sealing them shut with duct tape. We didn’t however replace the mattress I had at my last apartment \[I know how foolish that was now\] and so it all began again. Great. 

We lived in apartment complex who had a bed bug addendum that stated they would pay for everything including treatments. 

We waited a few weeks and filed a maintenance request and had an exterminator come out I believe it was 2-3 times in the span of 2 months. They found    nothing, no eggs, molts, fecal stains, or live bugs. 

They sprayed Spectre 3 times within the span of 2-3 months as directed. Still saw signs of bites all over hands neck and face of both myself and my partner. 

The only other option we had was to have a heat treatment done, which we had to actually pay for because out of sheer desperation at them not believing me I told them I had brought them there, so that makes me responsible. 

October 24th was that heat treatment. We didn’t have a lot of furniture in our apartment and had prepped the best we could. 

It still didn’t work. 

At that point we were nearing the end of our lease and when we were offered the chance to renew, kindly declined and looked for a new place to live. 

We eventually did find a place and made a plan to get rid of everything and treat what we could. All of our clothes went into the dryer and then immediately into black trash bags and brought out to the car. Everything I own is sitting in totes duct taped shut with Nuvan strips in it. We threw away all of the furniture, couch, bed, nightstands, dressers, coffee table and a ton of other stuff. 

Bought a new bed, couch, and everything and moved into our new place last Tuesday. 

Started waking up with bites within about 3-5 days of being here; and at this point I genuinely don’t know what to do. All of our clothes are still in bags on the floor because we don’t know if we should build the dressers or just go get plastic totes and keep a few outfits out. 

I’m so far in debt because of this I can’t breathe, I just started a new job that I really enjoy but having this issue could potentially affect it and that simply can’t happen. 

I feel naive, stupid and desperate; I know I’m not the only person that’s dealing with this right now but that just makes it worse. 

I appreciate any feed back, negative or positive. 

If you happen to click onto my Reddit profile, enjoy what you see but please don’t judge. I didn’t want to make a whole new Reddit just to post this, but I’m desperate for any help. ",1,1768481065.0,Bedbugs,1,1.0,False

After wondering why it didn't automatically update, I uninstall the old app and now find that my phone is not compatible with the new app and that I can't install it.

Sure, Fidelity has made a host of other 2-factor modes available and I will be switching to one of those.  I'm guessing that my phone is older and is no longer getting OS updates and that there is some feature in the new OS's that the Fidelity app is now using, but this is still more than a little annoying, especially with only one cup of coffee in my system.",0,1768480904.0,fidelityinvestments,5,0.5,False

These are collected incident of two years that had   happened to me, and it was a major reason I left the company. Because of the company’s bullying culture, I decided to leave the moment I hear the terms like unpaid probation and delayed contracts. 

Recently i joined some company they delayed my contract letter before i signed there contract i left. Later, the bullying escalated—they even threatened legal action,  i replied  I was never an employee blocked the number returned company hoodie(  using in-drive they even asked for (khako paisa imagine how cheap these people can go), despite the fact that there was no written contract during my time there. Now that they haven’t been able to find a replacement i guess, the threats have continued.

In one of my earlier companies, there was a tea/coffee vending machine, but staff weren’t allowed to drink milk coffee. There was no restroom for clients, and meat products were banned in the shared kitchen. Major chai you have to respond the client  and company at any public days pani or attend there webinar cause India has sunday holidays.

At another company before that, the contractor tricked me into staying under an agreement where I was supposed to be paid part-time based on the number of students. The problem was that it was completely off-season thats why they hired him. Salary was based on number of students. I have to be there early morning to open there office. To find out there is no students for months. 

At yet another company, they had a so-called one-week probation followed by a 1–3 month internship kaam salary. Even after eight months, I was still stuck as an intern, so I eventually left.

There are so many issues with Nepali private companies that talking about them never seems to end. If they can’t keep their staff happy, attracting and retaining clients is out of the question.

One thing I’ve learned: once your is salary  is issued start and once you receive another offer, it’s best to switch off the phone and do what you know is right….. they will find next bakra…

* empty the portafilter & run an empty double espresso shot
* wipe the steam wand and briefly run the wand 
* take out the bottom basket part, empty the water into the sink & briefly run water over the 3 parts, then leave to dry
* take out the portafilter basket and run water over it and the portafilter (sometimes I use dish soap to scrub them), then leave to dry

It feels like quite a bit of work to do this each time, so I'm kind of hoping not to have to (for example) take out the bottom part to empty the water every single time? Am I missing anything?

And there's been one such case in my life that really drove that home.

Throughout my adulthood, I've realized that, if you look young - especially for your age - then you can get away with dating people who are much younger than you.

For instance, I have a friend who was 32 years old when he'd started going out with his girlfriend who was 24 years old at the time. An 8-year gap, but my friend looked (and still does) like he was in his early/mid 20s, so people turned a blind eye.

Not that the age gap is wrong or anything. He was in his early 30s, and she was in her mid 20s, which is grown up enough in my books, so I wouldn't say anything about it, personally.

But the reason as to why I bring it up is because we had another friend who had a 7 year age gap - he was 31, and his girlfriend was also 24 - but he looked like he was 35 years old (forehead wrinkles, balding, crow's feet). For some reason, our friends were really against the relationship, saying that he was dating a girl who was too young for him.

Obviously, this threw the group into disarray because we had two couples who were pretty much in the same boat, but one was given the pass while the other wasn't, mostly due to the differences in their physical youths. And that wasn't my only case of having seen this type of treatment.

Relationship-related ageism really does seem to exist. Anecdotally, at least. And I've seen it across cultures. And this isn't just about romantic relationships. Older people who look young fit very well into an ecosystem with younger, more youthful people. But older people who look their age (or older) are given stares, are told to stay away/be careful, etc. It even sometimes happens with younger people who look old for their age.

idk, just a thought I had while I was sipping some coffee this morning.

You know that feeling of fear when you start school for the next grade or when you hear the sharp, skittering sound of a spider's legs on a hard floor right in front of you? It's that split second when your heart races and your breath catches. Or have you ever felt that kind of fear on the brink of death, and you're begging for your life? Have you maybe felt the same fear of getting caught, murder, for example? What about the kind of fear where you don't feel safe in your own home? I have felt all of these fears, and I have faced them willingly or unwillingly; it doesn’t matter. But this? This is terror that I am feeling: something different.

How are we going to overcome this one? My name, by the way. The one talking right now. I am Manny. I don't know how else to say it, but there's a part of me missing. It's like standing in front of a mirror and not recognizing the reflection, and my own name feels foreign at times, like a distant memory I can't quite grasp. I know who I am, don't get me wrong, but there's a gap between pieces of myself. I seem disconnected from my own identity, as if parts of me drift away when I'm not looking. Let me paint a picture of who I am, and then I'll dive into what's happening right now. I just turned nineteen, and I have some issues. It started last year. I used to keep an old, worn soccer ball in my room, one that had been with me through countless games as a kid. Holding it sometimes makes me feel grounded, recalling the boy who used to have so much certainty. However, I recently noticed it's not there anymore, like another fractured piece of my identity. I was hearing voices. Everyone hears voices. Yeah, but mine sometimes act out the thoughts made by such a voice. Act quickly, let me explain.

I was driving down the highway with a group of friends, our conversation buzzing and the speed comforting. Suddenly, a flash—a deer's wild eyes caught in my headlights. Instinct kicked in, I swerved, lost control. Gone. Then I snap back, racing nearly 100 miles per hour on the interstate, my friends yelling for me to stop. That incident triggered something, things just got worse from there. Myra, a name you will hear a lot, takes care of me. When I came to, Myra just acted like nothing happened. She took care of everything.

Anyways, Myra takes care of me, all of me, and right now I am messed up. When I talk about things being coherent, it’s like I take a step back, and suddenly I’m Amanda G. McCulkin. At nineteen, I try to keep life on track—college, friends, keeping clean, and showing up to all my classes. At least, I thought that was the case. Starting this diary isn’t just about maintaining notes; it’s about understanding myself as I go through this process. Sitting here in my dorm feels like the safest thing to do when I feel caught in between. It’s a moment to breathe, a pause in the chaos, just me and my journal, trying to piece it all together.

10 am 

Holy shit, this cannot be happening. I wish this laugh were recorded cause it needs to go down as the ‘Ah fuck’. It’s an excellent sound. Anyways, fuck, I have missed my third class in a row with Qaugmire. He was hard, but I had been doing so well with all of my work. I'm fucking impressive, actually. I worked so hard to get into that class, and now, poof, for something I couldn't control, something that wasn't my fault. Why? Why would I miss three classes in a row? What reason did I have to miss one of the biggest tests I will ever have? Holy shit, dude. Like what is happening to me. I need to chill and maybe make my schedule like Myra; she can help. I hope she can help. 

3:00 pm 

Since Myra has been around, everything is really normal today. Nothing crazy, no classes missed, all meals accounted for, everything up to now. I've got two more classes to get through, and then I plan to head back to my dorm. Despite the chaos, I'm finding a surprising calmness in the routine, a moment to catch my breath amidst the whirlwind. I have so much shit to do, and my schedule is busy. I need to go to my room and chill out for the rest of the night. Myra and I can study, and everything will be cool.

3:00 am 

Fuck. That’s all, just fuck. Things are getting weird, weird. Like it's 3 in the morning. Tell me why I am fully dressed and my shoes are muddy as fuck. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I have been. I don't know anything anymore. Myra was sleeping. I had gone to bed. I don't understand. I can't go to the doctor—just my parents. To have a blemish in the family name, how could I? Right to Whittaker is where they will put me. I can figure this out. 

8:00 am 

Someone at the school is dead, and I knew him. They are saying he did it to himself, a fentanyl overdose, just kept taking one after another as if the pills were candy. I can't believe it. He wouldn't do anything that had that in it, like he's a good kid. I don't know, it's just spine-tingling. The strangest thing is, the other day we were sitting at the old oak tree behind the library, laughing about how time seemed to slip by unnoticed whenever we were there. I can still hear his laugh, and every time the wind rustles through the leaves, it feels like he's right there, whispering that everything's okay. But now, under that same tree, I feel an emptiness that chills me to the bone. 

I sit at the base of the oak, taking in the quiet solitude. The leaves above rustle softly, a gentle reminder of the conversations we once shared. It's as if the world has hit pause, allowing me to soak in the sadness and the growing fear of what all this means. This stillness, however brief, weighs heavily on my heart, a moment where sorrow lingers before the chaos inevitably sweeps back in.

5:00 pm 

So far, so good. Today is going well, besides what happened. It's so sad to even talk about it, honestly. I can't say I understand because I have never felt like that before. I wonder what made that boy do it. What was so bad that was happening that he did that to himself? Why do people reach such a breaking point? I am going to bed at 8 tonight, and I am not and will not get out of bed for the rest of the night.

3:00am

Fuck. That’s all, just fuck. Things are getting weird, weird. Like it's 3 in the morning. I'm standing here, fully dressed, and my shoes are muddy as fuck. The weight of the dirt feels heavy, as if it's trying to pull me back to wherever I came from. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I have been, and I don't know anything anymore. Myra was sleeping. I had gone to bed. I don't understand. There's a wild pounding in my chest, each heartbeat echoing in the silence—loud and insistent, like a warning. It's like my body knows something my mind refuses to comprehend. I can't go to the doctor—just my parents. To have a blemish in the family name, how could I? Right to Whittaker is where they will put me. I can figure this out.

8:00 am 

I talked to Myra. She's going to stay up and watch me tonight to see what happens. She told me I'm not alone. I'm just scared right now. I'm afraid, and I don't understand what's happening. I know this has to be some mental illness, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm not going to try to diagnose myself. This could be several things anyway, and looking up symptoms online is just going to scare me more and make me even more confused. Myra is going to help me. I know I can count on her. But there's this inner battle raging in me about seeking real help. Part of me wants to reach out to campus counseling, to talk to someone professional. Yet, there's a heavy stigma attached to the idea of therapy that holds me back. Of all the fears swirling in my mind, the fear of how my parents might react feels the most acute. I worry they would see therapy as a sign of weakness, a mark against the family, a 'blemish' they couldn’t bear. It's like I'm stuck between protecting their perception and confronting what’s festering within me. Maybe I need to face this fear, just like Myra stays by me. Perhaps I owe it to myself to seek the support I need beyond what she can give.

11:00 am

I found drugs in my locker. I honestly barely use the locker, but today I thought I would check it to see if one of my books was in there. To my shock, the top shelf held a baggie filled with white powder capsules. They look like they were made and sold on the street. How could this have possibly ended up in my locker? The sight sent a jolt of panic through me. If campus security or the police find out, I could be expelled or even arrested. The thought that someone might have planted them there, and why, makes my head spin. Am I being set up? How many more questions am I going to have before I get answers? Every passing hour feels like a countdown to disaster unless I figure out how to deal with this ticking time bomb in my locker.

2:30 pm

They found another student dead today. It's another tragic ending for someone I never thought would harm themselves. I know it involved a tub and a razor blade. I heard there was a lot of blood. I knew Nick, too—a good guy, involved in both the chess and debate clubs, always seemed grounded. This moment feels disconnected from everything I thought I knew, as if the fabric of my reality is coming apart at the seams. What is happening in life right now, and why is everything around me spiraling out of control? As I try to process this, I notice a faint smell of bleach lingering on my clothes, an odd detail I can't explain. Was it there before? It feels like each tragedy is connected by an invisible thread, perhaps questioning how much of this chaos is beyond anyone's control or a reflection of some more profound, shared dilemma. Are we authors of our own fates, or are we trapped in a narrative we can't escape? I had a huge test today too, and I was so unfocused that I don't even know if I passed. I've been so tired, more than I feel I should be, like I haven't slept in days even though my clock said otherwise this morning. Please, Goddess of Earth, don't let anything worse happen.

9:00 pm 

I have stayed up a little late studying. Myra is up with a cup of coffee. She decided to spend the night keeping an eye on me and studying. I am so grateful for her. I am scared right now as I fall asleep. Why are these things only happening to me at night? Fuck, I hope I stay asleep tonight. 

8:00 am 

I woke to the unsettling sound of a rope creaking in the room's silence, and the faint, earthy scent of damp soil filled my nostrils. My palms seared with pain, and I realized they were marked with rope burns. My shoes were caked with mud, as though I had trudged through a forest overnight. This time, the scent was stronger, mixing with a whiff of something sharp, almost metallic, that tugged at my memory from previous wanderings. Myra said I drugged her. She explained she had merely gone to the bathroom, returned for more coffee, and suddenly collapsed against her desk. She recounted how I looked at her with an expression unrecognizable, like a stranger had taken over me. If I wasn't my fucking self, then who the fuck was I? I'm scared. Myra is scared. I don't know what to do now.

5:00 pm 

Officers were all over campus today, and I even saw some detectives. I don't think that these deaths have been what we all thought they were. I think someone is out there killing students. This time, it was this girl named Kiera. She hung herself in the back of the park in one of the trees. She had been there all night before she was found, is what I heard. All of this is really surreal, and I can't help but wonder if it has to do with me. Let's connect some dots really fast. Overdose: I discovered suspicious drugs in my locker. Slit wrists: I found myself covered in blood. A hung girl: I woke up with rope burns on my hands. It's as if my body remembers events that my mind can't process. Myra wants to go to someone, tell them what's going on, but I'm trapped in fear, tangled in threads that seem to tighten with every passing moment. I don't know what to do. I know I'm scared.

8:00 am 

I was out again last night. I was dressed and covered in mud when I woke up. Myra wasn't in the room this morning when I woke up either. I'm hoping she just went to class early. My exhaustion feels more than just tiredness; it's like every fiber of my being is weighed down, my eyelids rusted shut, my thoughts struggling through a thick, unyielding fog. I want this all to end. But maybe I need to try something different, something small to grasp at some control. Tonight, after classes, I’ll start with writing down everything I remember, every small detail, and maybe even check in with the residence advisor. Getting it out on paper might help me piece it together or at least show me a pattern, a glimmer of clarity in all this madness.

3:00 pm 

No sign of Myra. All day. A horrible feeling churns in my gut. Sick to my stomach. Can't stop throwing up. Nerves writhing inside me. Shaky. Twitchy. Feels like withdrawing from something. I cry uncontrollably. Who can I even talk to? Not the cops. Who won't go straight to them? I can't handle this.

At nineteen, I try to keep life on track—college, friends, keeping clean, and showing up to all my classes. At least, I thought that was the case. Starting this diary isn’t just about maintaining notes; it’s about understanding myself as I go through this process. Sitting here in my dorm feels like the safest thing to do when I feel caught in between. It’s a moment to breathe, a pause in the chaos, just me and my journal, trying to piece it all together.

10 am 

Holy shit, this cannot be happening. I wish this laugh were recorded cause it needs to go down as the ‘Ah fuck’. It’s an excellent sound. Anyways, fuck, I have missed my third class in a row with Qaugmire. He was hard, but I had been doing so well with all of my work. I'm fucking impressive, actually. I worked so hard to get into that class, and now, poof, for something I couldn't control, something that wasn't my fault. Why? Why would I miss three classes in a row? What reason did I have to miss one of the biggest tests I will ever have? Holy shit, dude. Like what is happening to me. I need to chill and maybe make my schedule like Myra; she can help. I hope she can help. 

3:00 pm 

Since Myra has been around, everything is really normal today. Nothing crazy, no classes missed, all meals accounted for, everything up to now. I've got two more classes to get through, and then I plan to head back to my dorm. Despite the chaos, I'm finding a surprising calmness in the routine, a moment to catch my breath amidst the whirlwind. I have so much shit to do, and my schedule is busy. I need to go to my room and chill out for the rest of the night. Myra and I can study, and everything will be cool.

3:00 am 

Fuck. That’s all, just fuck. Things are getting weird, weird. Like it's 3 in the morning. Tell me why I am fully dressed and my shoes are muddy as fuck. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I have been. I don't know anything anymore. Myra was sleeping. I had gone to bed. I don't understand. I can't go to the doctor—just my parents. To have a blemish in the family name, how could I? Right to Whittaker is where they will put me. I can figure this out. 

8:00 am 

Someone at the school is dead, and I knew him. They are saying he did it to himself, a fentanyl overdose, just kept taking one after another as if the pills were candy. I can't believe it. He wouldn't do anything that had that in it, like he's a good kid. I don't know, it's just spine-tingling. The strangest thing is, the other day we were sitting at the old oak tree behind the library, laughing about how time seemed to slip by unnoticed whenever we were there. I can still hear his laugh, and every time the wind rustles through the leaves, it feels like he's right there, whispering that everything's okay. But now, under that same tree, I feel an emptiness that chills me to the bone. 

I sit at the base of the oak, taking in the quiet solitude. The leaves above rustle softly, a gentle reminder of the conversations we once shared. It's as if the world has hit pause, allowing me to soak in the sadness and the growing fear of what all this means. This stillness, however brief, weighs heavily on my heart, a moment where sorrow lingers before the chaos inevitably sweeps back in.

5:00 pm 

So far, so good. Today is going well, besides what happened. It's so sad to even talk about it, honestly. I can't say I understand because I have never felt like that before. I wonder what made that boy do it. What was so bad that was happening that he did that to himself? Why do people reach such a breaking point? I am going to bed at 8 tonight, and I am not and will not get out of bed for the rest of the night.

3:00am

Fuck. That’s all, just fuck. Things are getting weird, weird. Like it's 3 in the morning. I'm standing here, fully dressed, and my shoes are muddy as fuck. The weight of the dirt feels heavy, as if it's trying to pull me back to wherever I came from. I don't know what to do. I don't know where I have been, and I don't know anything anymore. Myra was sleeping. I had gone to bed. I don't understand. There's a wild pounding in my chest, each heartbeat echoing in the silence—loud and insistent, like a warning. It's like my body knows something my mind refuses to comprehend. I can't go to the doctor—just my parents. To have a blemish in the family name, how could I? Right to Whittaker is where they will put me. I can figure this out.

8:00 am 

I talked to Myra. She's going to stay up and watch me tonight to see what happens. She told me I'm not alone. I'm just scared right now. I'm afraid, and I don't understand what's happening. I know this has to be some mental illness, but I'm not a doctor, and I'm not going to try to diagnose myself. This could be several things anyway, and looking up symptoms online is just going to scare me more and make me even more confused. Myra is going to help me. I know I can count on her. But there's this inner battle raging in me about seeking real help. Part of me wants to reach out to campus counseling, to talk to someone professional. Yet, there's a heavy stigma attached to the idea of therapy that holds me back. Of all the fears swirling in my mind, the fear of how my parents might react feels the most acute. I worry they would see therapy as a sign of weakness, a mark against the family, a 'blemish' they couldn’t bear. It's like I'm stuck between protecting their perception and confronting what’s festering within me. Maybe I need to face this fear, just like Myra stays by me. Perhaps I owe it to myself to seek the support I need beyond what she can give.

11:00 am

I found drugs in my locker. I honestly barely use the locker, but today I thought I would check it to see if one of my books was in there. To my shock, the top shelf held a baggie filled with white powder capsules. They look like they were made and sold on the street. How could this have possibly ended up in my locker? The sight sent a jolt of panic through me. If campus security or the police find out, I could be expelled or even arrested. The thought that someone might have planted them there, and why, makes my head spin. Am I being set up? How many more questions am I going to have before I get answers? Every passing hour feels like a countdown to disaster unless I figure out how to deal with this ticking time bomb in my locker.

2:30 pm

They found another student dead today. It's another tragic ending for someone I never thought would harm themselves. I know it involved a tub and a razor blade. I heard there was a lot of blood. I knew Nick, too—a good guy, involved in both the chess and debate clubs, always seemed grounded. This moment feels disconnected from everything I thought I knew, as if the fabric of my reality is coming apart at the seams. What is happening in life right now, and why is everything around me spiraling out of control? As I try to process this, I notice a faint smell of bleach lingering on my clothes, an odd detail I can't explain. Was it there before? It feels like each tragedy is connected by an invisible thread, perhaps questioning how much of this chaos is beyond anyone's control or a reflection of some more profound, shared dilemma. Are we authors of our own fates, or are we trapped in a narrative we can't escape? I had a huge test today too, and I was so unfocused that I don't even know if I passed. I've been so tired, more than I feel I should be, like I haven't slept in days even though my clock said otherwise this morning. Please, Goddess of Earth, don't let anything worse happen.

9:00 pm 

I have stayed up a little late studying. Myra is up with a cup of coffee. She decided to spend the night keeping an eye on me and studying. I am so grateful for her. I am scared right now as I fall asleep. Why are these things only happening to me at night? Fuck, I hope I stay asleep tonight. 

8:00 am 

I woke to the unsettling sound of a rope creaking in the room's silence, and the faint, earthy scent of damp soil filled my nostrils. My palms seared with pain, and I realized they were marked with rope burns. My shoes were caked with mud, as though I had trudged through a forest overnight. This time, the scent was stronger, mixing with a whiff of something sharp, almost metallic, that tugged at my memory from previous wanderings. Myra said I drugged her. She explained she had merely gone to the bathroom, returned for more coffee, and suddenly collapsed against her desk. She recounted how I looked at her with an expression unrecognizable, like a stranger had taken over me. If I wasn't my fucking self, then who the fuck was I? I'm scared. Myra is scared. I don't know what to do now.

5:00 pm 

Officers were all over campus today, and I even saw some detectives. I don't think that these deaths have been what we all thought they were. I think someone is out there killing students. This time, it was this girl named Kiera. She hung herself in the back of the park in one of the trees. She had been there all night before she was found, is what I heard. All of this is really surreal, and I can't help but wonder if it has to do with me. Let's connect some dots really fast. Overdose: I discovered suspicious drugs in my locker. Slit wrists: I found myself covered in blood. A hung girl: I woke up with rope burns on my hands. It's as if my body remembers events that my mind can't process. Myra wants to go to someone, tell them what's going on, but I'm trapped in fear, tangled in threads that seem to tighten with every passing moment. I don't know what to do. I know I'm scared.

8:00 am 

I was out again last night. I was dressed and covered in mud when I woke up. Myra wasn't in the room this morning when I woke up either. I'm hoping she just went to class early. My exhaustion feels more than just tiredness; it's like every fiber of my being is weighed down, my eyelids rusted shut, my thoughts struggling through a thick, unyielding fog. I want this all to end. But maybe I need to try something different, something small to grasp at some control. Tonight, after classes, I’ll start with writing down everything I remember, every small detail, and maybe even check in with the residence advisor. Getting it out on paper might help me piece it together or at least show me a pattern, a glimmer of clarity in all this madness.

3:00 pm 

No sign of Myra. All day. A horrible feeling churns in my gut. Sick to my stomach. Can't stop throwing up. Nerves writhing inside me. Shaky. Twitchy. Feels like withdrawing from something. I cry uncontrollably. Who can I even talk to? Not the cops. Who won't go straight to them? I can't handle this.

7:00 pm

1qdi2rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sp404mk2/comments/1qdi2rb/lets_talk_about_mixing_on_the_sp404_mk2/,Lets talk about mixing on the SP404 MK2,"Hi there! I recently got my SP404 MK2, did some experiments, resampled etc. However there is one aspect I still don't know how to do properly and that's: **mixing**.

But my question is more fundamental than just technical workflow...

**How do people actually HEAR if something is mixed correctly?**

When I have different samples (bass, melodies, drums etc.) loaded up, how do I *know* they ""play well"" together? What am I supposed to be listening for?

Some questions I have:

* **What makes a ""good mix""?** Is it just that everything is audible? That nothing is too loud or too quiet? That frequencies don't clash? How do you know when you're done?
* **Process order** \- Where do I even start? Set levels first, then EQ, then compression? Or EQ first to clean things up, then balance levels? Is there a ""correct"" order or does everyone have their own approach?
* **Frequency clashing** \- How do you identify when elements are fighting for the same frequency space? Do you just... hear it? Or do you follow rules like ""cut lows from everything except kick/bass""?
* **The learning curve** \- Is this something that just comes with experience, like wine or coffee tasting? Did you all go through a phase where you couldn't tell if your mix was good or terrible?

I feel like I'm working somewhat blind here - I can make beats that sound ""okay"" to me, but I have no reference point for what ""well-mixed"" actually means or sounds like. Sometimes I think something sounds great, then I listen on different speakers and it's completely different.

**For those who've been doing this for a while: How did you develop your ear for mixing? Any exercises, techniques, or any other best practices... ?**

Thanks in advance! 🙏",5,1768479727.0,sp404mk2,3,1.0,False
1qdi14a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirdEyePoetry/comments/1qdi14a/but_first_coffee/,"But First, Coffee","Philip likes coffee exceedingly. No sugar or cream for Philip, please. He prefers his black. The stronger, the better.

Philip and Sonia's house smelled like a Starbucks all the time. Signs hung on the kitchen wall with funny expressions, like: *Coffee! Because Murder is Wrong*, and *Give Me the Coffee and No One Gets Hurt*.

Three cups before leaving home for work. One at lunch, one immediately after, still another two at supper. If Sonia prepared dessert, another cup to complement it. That had been Phillip's routine for years.
   
It was early morning; the sun hadn't yet peeked above the horizon. Philip sat at the kitchen table in the dark, sipping from his cup of freshly brewed goodness. There was a smile of contentment on his face.
   
Sonia couldn't sleep. She'd been up all night crying, but Philip didn't know that. He poured his second cup and breathed in its rich aroma as Sonia made her way downstairs and into the kitchen. She switched on the light. Her scream woke the neighbors.

Yesterday was Philip's funeral. But who could expect him to rest well, after drinking all that coffee?",5,1768479586.0,ThirdEyePoetry,11,1.0,False
1qdi10d,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1qdi10d/i_think_metformin_is_disturbing_my_intestines/,I think metformin is disturbing my intestines,"Hi everyone. So 3 months ago I had an episode of stomach discomfort for a week, but it went away after a couple of weeks.

Two months ago I got prescribed metformin for insulin resistance. I instantly started having side effects, but I was attributung them in part to that gastritis that I had. 

However, my stomach is fine now and my symptoms persist in what I only can guess are my intestines. 

I'm basically getting IBS-like symptoms. Lots of gas, diarrhea during the night 2 or 3 times a week and cramps during the nights when that happens. 

But the worst thing about all of this is the discomfort. Whenever I walk, bend, twist or turn I get this feeling like someone punched me in my belly (right around the bellybutton). It also overall feels like my guts became extremely sensitive and I have a lot of flatulence recently. 

I'm getting tired of this since I basically can't have any coffee (it makes it worse) and I'm going crazy because any time I walk it's either mild discomfort or outright feeling like some asshole grabbed my intestine and won't let go. 

I know metformin is associated with gut issues, but really? Sometimes I want to cry because it seems to go away, then I eat or drink something that my gut doesn't like and it's back again. It just feels never-ending. 

I'd really like to stay on metformin and I don't know what to do. 

Has anyone ran into something similar? Any advice? 

Thanks! ",1,1768479574.0,diabetes,6,1.0,False
