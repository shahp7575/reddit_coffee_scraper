Some back story, I met someone at an event very briefly, and turned the charm on and got her IG... 

Said I'd like to catch up over coffee, but didn't implicitly make it romantic or flirty.

So maybe she didn't even know it's a date, or went in with the same intentions.. 

But we spent two hours talking over coffee, and while all the signs of a decent time were there:

Flowing conversation
Questions, deep and surface 
Making her laugh several times 

I don't feel like I was charming, or more importantly, flirty. I was a little self conscious as I lost myself in her beauty several times and not as present as usual.. 

She had to rush off like I knew she would for something happening after, but left with a simple goodbye and nice to meet you and a passing comment of ""keep in touch"" as we hugged goodbye.

And sure, it was a short coffee catchup.. And maybe like a ""pre-date"" since we spoke all of 2 minutes at the event... But I feel like I 'failed'.

Is it redeemable? Am I reading l too much into it?

I am female, about 170 cm and I usually weigh between 95 and 101 stone, currently I'm at 99. 

My goal weight is 70kg, but I am heavy in the chest area (UK 38 J cup, they weight about 4kg each) and so have most of my family members been, no matter how much they weigh, so it might end up being more, just because of body type. 

My BMI is 33.9 (Obese) and my Height/waist ratio is 0.53 (overweight). 

I eat about 1200 calories a day, most of it fruit/veg and protein, I don't eat breakfast, I usually have a wrap or sandwich for lunch, I let myself have one evening snack (which is usually fruit) and most of my food is my evening meal. I drink a lot of water, fruit teas and coffee, (not crazy in sugar) 

I exercise every day, for at least 30 mins, and up to an hour and a half. (I do pilates 4 days a week (two upper and two lower body) and cardio three days a week, alternating, and I'm looking to swap one of my pilates leg days out for leg weight training) 

I am in a wheelchair, so I don't do any steps on top of that, but I do get a good arm exercise in most days, since I live in a hilly town, which my watch registers average as about 4k steps a day, but its probably 'more' since it doesn't detect every push as a step. 

I don't drink in excess (I am a uni student, so have a night out, about once every month/every other month) and I don't smoke or vape. I sleep well too. 

I asked my GP for help with weightloss since nothing I was doing was working but they told me to 'try weightwatchers' and 'try going to the gym' but I was already dieting, and exercising regularly, which is why I asked for help... 

Can anyone suggest what I'm doing wrong? Or give me anything else to do? Any advice at all on what I'm doing, I am willing to try anything. Any help is appreciated! Thank you",1,1728252415.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I (37) recently got married to my husband (42). We eloped in one of the most beautiful places in the world, a coastal rainforest. 

I planned a vast majority of our elopement trip, including one of the most incredible accommodations I have ever experienced in my life. A totally unique, once in a life time experience for us. Obviously, this trip was very special for me because … well we were getting married. 

My husband took very little initiative regarding the wedding, and as I would find out once we arrived at our destination, he planned nothing for while were there (5 days total). I had booked reservations for a unique wild life tour and a surf excursion. 

On our wedding day we exchanged gifts. I had saved up a decent amount of money to buy him a nice watch to match his suit. He had mentioned a few times how he liked having a “nice watch” outside of his regular daily watch, but his previous “nice watch” had broken. I put a lot of time and effort into finding one that I knew he would like, as he has particular taste.

My gift was his and hers yeti travel mugs and a painted rock. The rock is incredibly sweet and sentimental and I do not want to minimize that at all.

As the trip came to an end, it turned into a pretty huge disaster. I was really upset at his lack of effort in planning anything, and on top of it, the day after our wedding our tour I had booked was cancelled due to weather, and he spent almost the entire day sleeping because he wasn’t feeling well. I was super, super bummed out. I just wanted a tiny amount of effort shown for me during that week, and I got none.

We were discussing how I was feeling and I mentioned that I felt hurt about the trip and that I felt the yeti mugs were just.. oddly impersonal for a wedding gift. He literally doesn’t drink coffee or use a travel mug. It didn’t make sense to me as it didn’t reflect anything about our wedding and what I meant to him. He met me with “I got those mugs so we could spend time together drinking coffee in the rainforest on our trip” and I said “but we didn’t do that. That never happened. So the part of my gift that was meaningful, I never received.” 

He got very upset with me and started crying. He told me that it’s a “lifelong symbol” of him wanting to spend time with me. Which… he doesn’t do. It’s actually a constant argument in our relationship. He then told me he will show me the meaning of these mugs next summer… at my families vacation home.

I feel like he is trying to manipulate his way out of giving me a lame gift in comparison to what he received. The sentimental value or purpose of this gift, I never actually received. So it’s still just a travel mug. He also cannot answer why he didn’t follow through with the part where he actually had to sit down and have coffee with me on that trip. No explanation for that.

Am I overreacting for thinking this gift was kind of impersonal and lame and now also feeling like he’s totally trying to manipulate his way out of this? Am I overreacting for not being super pumped about the mugs?

To my surprise, the PM 2019 is relatively open for business. Still tight in the finish, but lovely fruit (blueberry, some raspberry, sour cherry) with leather, aniseed, chocolate and coffee on the palate. Moves into the bitter aspects on the finish, with lots of red berry and coffee (like drinking a good drip coffee) on the finish. Plenty of acid to keep it fresh. Lots of minerality. 92? Really good. I definitely didn’t get the heat or disjointed elements referred to in a few cellartracker posts. It was all quite harmonious. 

The Michelot was from 375. Although only a lesser Meursault, it was lovely as you’d expect. Apple, honey, lemon. Definitely oaked and quite a round mouthfeel, but not as rich / heavy as some of the grander Meursault of this world.

1fxs4gc,https://i.redd.it/8r0gqdvmk7td1.jpeg,Help with color combinations for my new apartment (with oak wood floors),"Hey everyone,

I'm in the process of furnishing my small apartment and could use some advice to nail down the design. I've got natural oak parquet flooring, and I'm visualizing a kitchen where the cabinets are in a light kashmir/sand color (I've attached a mockup). The wooden-like cabinets, dining table, countertop, and outlets are where I'm feeling stuck.

I like the idea of the wood matching the floor, but I'm open to experimenting with other finishes for the wooden elements if it makes sense. My apartment is small, so I'm trying to keep everything cohesive and simple, especially since the carpenter making the kitchen will also do my bed and coffee table. I want everything to flow together, but l'm no design expert.

The only other thing I've decided on is a brick red or barn red sofa for the living room. Apart from that, I'm pretty flexible and open to ideas. What wood finishes, color combos, or materials do you think would work well with the oak floor and red sofa?

I appreciate any tips or suggestions!

Thanks a lot! :)

Sorry I haven't been around in a while. I'm now coming back with a question that I have forgotten and forgot to note down (or can't find it). I believe there was a discrepancy between Farm Land and Fish Land clicks resetting.   
  
One was a full 24h from the last click. The other was like 24h + reset at 12:00 AM Local time. Does anyone know which was which or the correct time for most of these games if my notes are wrong? 

Fish Land - Local 12:00 AM  
Farm Land - Local 12:00 AM  
Temu Tree - Gone  
Free Coffee - Full 24h after 10th click? (I'm having a lot of issues with the new version)  
Refer and Earn - Gone  
Daily Box - PST  
Free Gifts + Hat Trick - Local 12:00 AM

Outside of that question, I am redoing some of the guide, still working on some of it, and revamping the spreadsheet to be simpler, but to also show you when you can click again. I have learned a lot more about spreadsheets in the last few months and will be bringing that knowledge to the original spreadsheet which is now under construction.

1fxrzh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1fxrzh1/my_wifes_affair/,My Wife's Affair,"Here’s your revised text:

I'm a 36-year-old man, and I've been married to my wife, 35, for ten years. Our marriage hasn't always been perfect, but I never thought she would step out on me. For years, my wife expressed concern about not having any friends, especially after losing her best friend due to a fight. About a year ago, she met a new friend—we’ll call her Angela—and they immediately clicked. They began doing coffee dates, girls' nights, and more recently, weekend getaways where they'd take short trips or staycations together. My wife always came back happy and relaxed, which made me feel good. I didn’t have to listen to her complaints as much, and I could focus on my own things.

Recently, I noticed a plaque on her desk. She had won an award at work but hadn't mentioned it to me. When I asked her about it, she said, ""I've had that for two months now."" I replied, ""Oh, why didn’t we celebrate?"" She told me she had celebrated—with Angela—and didn’t bother to mention it to me because, in her words, I ""don't like hearing about her 'stuff,'"" using air quotes. That comment stung, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

Last night, I came home from work and saw her phone unlocked on the kitchen counter. She was texting Angela, and one of the messages looked sexually suggestive. I casually picked up the phone and walked away, reading the entire thread. They're lovers, and it seems like they’re deeply in love with each other. I was crushed. I didn’t know what to say or do, so I placed the phone back on the counter and left to go to a friend's house. By the time I got home, she was already asleep. I barely slept last night, replaying everything in my head—how excited she’d been to meet Angela and how Angela had been in my home.

This morning, I called in sick to work to figure out my next move. My wife let me know she had made last-minute plans to go to a concert with Angela about two and a half hours away. She’d already booked an Airbnb and was planning to leave right after work, returning on Tuesday. I was fuming but, through my frustration, I said, ""Okay."" As usual, she gave me the details of where she’d be staying. I casually asked her when Angela would arrive, and she told me.

After contemplating for what felt like hours, I decided to confront her at the Airbnb. When I arrived, I banged on the door, and Angela answered. I was shocked—she wasn’t the woman I had met before. She was a beautiful Black woman with a lovely smile. I asked if she was Angela, and she said yes. I then asked for my wife, and Angela explained that she had gotten off work late and would be arriving in the next 30 to 45 minutes. She invited me in, asking if everything was okay. I declined and instead blurted out everything—I told her the affair was over. Angela calmly replied, “Okay,” and went back to prepping dinner.

As she cooked, Angela started talking about my wife’s recent promotion, which is why they had made last-minute plans to celebrate. My wife had just become the Executive Director of her program. Angela also mentioned my wife’s work rival and all the attempts to sabotage her over the last year. I was once again reminded of how little I knew about what was happening in my wife’s life. Then Angela stopped and asked if I knew the results of my wife’s cancer screening. My eyes widened, and I said, “What?” Angela explained that two days ago, my wife had to be screened for breast cancer because they had found a lump. I went silent and just sat there.

Ten minutes later, my wife knocked on the door. Angela opened it, and I overheard her saying, “Your husband is in the kitchen.” My wife walked in and asked why I was there. I could barely look at her. I just walked out of the house and drove home. A little while ago, my wife texted me, saying she had ended the trip early and would be home soon. 

I’m so unsure of what to do now.",1,1728251660.0,ComfortLevelPod,0,1.0,False

# Preparing Your Stories

One of the most effective ways to prepare for a behavioral interview is to prepare a repertoire of stories. These should highlight your experiences, skills, and achievements. Here are some key areas to focus on:

1. **Leadership**: Prepare examples of when you led a team or project, even if you weren't in an official leadership role.
2. **Teamwork**: Showcase instances where you collaborated effectively with others to achieve a common goal.
3. **Problem-solving**: Highlight situations where you identified and solved complex technical or interpersonal problems.
4. **Adaptability**: Describe when you had to quickly learn new technologies or adapt to changing project requirements.
5. **Conflict resolution**: Share examples of how you've handled disagreements with team members or stakeholders.
6. **Innovation**: Discuss occasions where you proposed and implemented new ideas or improvements.
7. **Time management**: Explain how you've juggled multiple priorities or met tight deadlines.

For each story, make sure you can clearly articulate the situation, your specific role, the actions you took, and the measurable results you achieved.

# Researching the Company and Role

Before your interview, thoroughly research the company and the specific role you're applying for. In-depth preparation will help you tailor your responses to align with the company's values and the job requirements. Pay attention to:

* The company's mission and values
* Recent news or product launches
* The specific technologies they use
* The team structure and culture.

Use this information to demonstrate your genuine interest in the role and to ask insightful questions during the interview.

# Common Behavioral Questions and How to Approach Them

While you can't predict every question, here are some common themes in engineering Behavioral interviews:

1. **Dealing with failure**: ""Tell me about a time when a project you were working on failed. How did you handle it?"" Approach: Be honest about the failure, focus on what you learned, and explain how you applied those lessons to future projects.
2. **Handling disagreements**: ""Describe a situation where you disagreed with a team member's approach. How did you resolve it?"" Approach: Emphasise your communication skills and ability to see multiple perspectives and focus on finding the best solution for the team.
3. **Managing priorities**: ""How do you handle multiple competing deadlines?"" Approach: Discuss your organizational skills, ability to prioritize tasks, and communication with stakeholders to manage expectations.
4. **Overcoming technical challenges**: ""Tell me about the most difficult technical problem you've solved."" Approach: Choose a complex problem that showcases your technical skills and problem-solving approach. Explain your thought process and the steps you took to reach the solution.
5. **Demonstrating initiative**: ""Can you give an example of a time when you went above and beyond in your role?"" Approach: Select a story that shows your proactivity, your willingness to take on additional responsibilities, and the positive impact of your actions.

# Practicing Your Responses

It's crucial to practice once you've prepared your stories and familiarised yourself with common questions. This step is often overlooked, but it's a great way to refine your responses and become more comfortable discussing your experiences. Here are some practical ways to do so:

1. **Record yourself**: Use your phone or computer to record your answers. It will help you identify areas for improvement in your delivery and content.
2. **Practice with a friend**: Ask a friend or family member to conduct a mock interview. Request honest feedback on your responses and body language.
3. **Join interview prep groups**: Many online platforms ([MeetAPro](https://www.meetapro.com/)) offer mock interview practice sessions. These are a great way to get real-life experience and constructive feedback from professionals.
4. **Use AI-powered interview** prep tools: Several AI tools can simulate interview scenarios and provide feedback on your responses.

Remember, the goal isn't to memorize scripted answers but to become comfortable discussing your experiences fluently and confidently.

# Mastering Non-Verbal Communication

Your body language and tone of voice can be just as important as the content of your answers. Here are some tips:

* Maintain good eye contact
* Sit up straight and lean slightly forward to show engagement
* Use natural hand gestures to emphasize points
* Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
* Practice active listening by nodding and providing verbal cues of understanding

# Asking Thoughtful Questions

Job interviews are a two-way street. Toward the end of the session, ask questions about the role, company, and working methods. It's not just a formality – it's a chance to demonstrate your interest and insight. Prepare questions that show you've researched and are thinking critically about the role. For example:

* ""Can you provide additional insights into the team's existing challenges and explain how this position would help resolve them?""
* ""How does the engineering team go about continuous learning and professional development?""
* ""What metrics do you use to measure success in this role?""

# Conclusion

Preparing for an engineering Behavioral interview requires thoughtful reflection on your experiences, practice articulating your stories, and research into the company and role. By following these tips and best practices, you'll be well-equipped to showcase your skills, experiences, and potential value to the organization. Remember, the key is to be authentic, confident, and well-prepared. Good luck with your interview!

1fxrryh,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1fxrryh/culture_shock_for_north_americans/,Culture Shock for North Americans,"I just found this list of cultural differences between North American and NZ culture written 10-15 years ago. I identify as a Kiwi now, but it was difficult at first. Most of the NZ customs derive from working class immigrants from the British Isles – 80% of kiwis have ancestors from the British Isles. NZ retains close ties to the UK - e.g. the current flag containing an image of the British flag, currency with images of the Queen, and the high court, until recently, residing in London. Many UK immigrant children hold UK passports. The Pacific Island and indigenous Maori cultures are also important factors.

**Cultural Tips**:

* Drive on the left side of the road.

* Walk on the left side.

* Do not pass on the passing lane if there is a traffic jam; it is considered impolite; you likely will prevented from doing so by irate drivers pulling into the passing lane to stop traffic.

* Do not jaywalk or cross the road when the pedestrian light says do not walk, even if there is no traffic is sight.

* Driving in cities can be a challenge since “no left” or “no right turn” signs (and sometimes “one-way” signs) are generally painted on the surface of the roads instead of signs on posts so that they are difficult to see, if not impossible when more than three cars are stopped at a light (since they cover the signs).   

* Like the rest of the world outside the USA, NZ uses the Metric System.

* No tipping - in restaurants, at the barbers, in taxis, or anywhere. The workers in these industries are mostly paid a living wage.

However, in the last 10 years, some tourist traps and high-end restaurants in Auckland and Wellington now charge “optional” tips. It is automatically added to the credit card charge as an “option” that is hard to ignore.

* North Island winter temperatures are mild, with highs averaging in the mid to high fifties, averaging between 12- 15 degrees C depending on which part of the North Island one lives (with a few frosts a year) – similar to coastal European Mediterranean regions. It lasts for 6-8 weeks on the North Island. Winter lasts a bit longer and is a few degrees colder in most of the South Island. New Zealand summers are often quite cool by North American or continental European standards. Anything over 77 F (25C) is considered hot outside of the east coast of the North Island ( and parts of the South island), where temperatures can become genuinely hot (up to the high 80’s). Wellington has the same average summer highs as Nordic Stockholm. Autumn is often the mildest and most settled (less windy) season. Spring is cool, and wet but lovely. Indeed, The weather year-round in North Island is similar to April and May in the Northern USA.

* Most of NZ has cloud cover similar to that of Seatle or Portland in the USA, with around 2000 sunshine hours a year.

* Be prepared and bring warm sweaters and dress in layers. Take your “hottie” to bed with you …(your hot water bottle). For North Americans, ***the single biggest cultural difference*** is the comparatively low temperature inside a home or public spaces such as restaurants and shops. New Zealanders (and Australians who share similar heating customs) appear to prefer temperatures about 5-10 degrees F (3 - 6 degrees C) cooler than North Americans or 3-4 degrees cooler than Europeans. Shorts and jandles (flip flops) are worn all winter. The average interior temperature is said to be 16 degrees. (60F). Most Kiwis have no central heating and little insulation. [https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/104100512/being-cold-and-rationing-heating-is-now-normal-in-new-zealand](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/104100512/being-cold-and-rationing-heating-is-now-normal-in-new-zealand) 

* When describing a “warm house,” New Zealanders mention insulation and “double glazing” (double pane windows) as the necessary ingredients for a warm house, but Kiwis rarely mention the even more important key ingredient - heat.  A recent NZ Herald article revealed that 1/3 of all homes have no heat at all. Power is more expensive than in North America, so perhaps only one room has heat – either a fire, gas (sometimes unventilated) or electric (electric oil heaters and small air heaters).

If the sun is out during a winter day, windows and doors fly open for “fresh air” (reversing whatever benefits one gets with the Greenhouse effect… while the cold outdoor air rushes in).

* Thermostats (control an even indoor temperature) as North Americans or Europeans know them, rarely exist. Thermoset-adjusted heat is mostly unknown.

In spite of heat pumps having thermostats of sorts, they are rarely used as such. Most people will power a heat pump (or any other heat unit for that matter) until it gets “hot” (over 18 degrees C, 65 degrees F). They then turn it off for the evening (allowing it to get cold again within a ½ hour or so).  Heat is used sparingly, if at all in the morning when homes are at it coldest. It is not unusual to have 9-10 degree (48-50 F) temperatures inside in the morning.

* It is considered “unwelcoming” to close a shop door in NZ and Australia. Shops and some restaurants leave doors wide open during the day - and even on the coldest of winter nights (unless they have automatic doors). Many Kiwis will not enter a shop if the door is closed.

* Do not talk about the lack of heating. Kiwis may find it insulating…it is considered an “Entitled American thing,” as someone angrily told me when asking for warmer temperatures at a film club. (No matter that only Australia and NZ remain about the only developed nations with no central heating.)

* Although both Islands are more or less elongated rectangles, there is only a “West Coast” and an “East Coast”. Do not refer to the north or south-facing coasts as the “north coast” or “south coast”.

* Artichokes here are generally referred to as “Jerusalem artichokes”, not the more common “true artichoke” (outside of NZ), where they are known simply as “an artichoke”. Those typical round artichokes are called “globe artichokes” in NZ. They are rare. They are generally ignored except for the bright purple flower used as ornamentation.

* We will generally ask anyone with a North American accent if they are Canadian - so as “not to insult Canadians”. Canadians are generally better liked than Americans. Americans are often considered arrogant and brash.

* We (and Australians) dress informally…Outside of the financial businesses, coats and ties are rare.

* New Zealand is reportedly the windiest country in the world - which may be overstated, but it is likely to be one of the windiest. It the only country as islands located entirely within the notoriously windy “Roaring 40’s” latitudes. What seems like normal wind to a New Zealander will seem very windy to many North Americans, particularly during the “equinox winds” - which take place between September and November - they often continue through the solstice and into January.

* Many of us take off shoes at the door and when a guest at another’s house - a custom still rare in the USA and Western Europe (though recently gaining popularity among the groovy folk in the US… and in the UK, where according to research, about 25% now take off their shoes.). According to a recent online unscientific poll on the website *Stuff*, 53% percent of Kiwis insist on taking shoes off, while 47% are fine with shoes on inside. Always check to see if shoes are piled up outside first, and then ask. Bring slippers; one’s feet can get quite cold.

* One can legally walk in bare feet in most places - on streets, in public buildings, and in stores. (I have even seen one air NZ passenger walk in bare feet on the Auckland Airport tarmac – in fact, the only place that it is in fact illegal.)

* Alcohol is registered at a lower limit than the USA. A typical 5% beer equal to one US standard drink, but it is considered 1.4 “standard drink” in NZ. A “shot” of spirits is 1 ounce, not 1.5 ounces as in the USA.

* Until recently, dogs have often been kept outside. They have been rarely or never let in the house…though this custom is now waning.

* Toilets are usually kept separate from the bath and/or shower. It is not uncommon to hear a person say, “I’m in the toilet.”

* Although seemingly obvious, it can take a while for a North American to get used to the birds fly north for the winter in the autumn.

* Kiwis rarely use napkins (also called serviettes). It can even be insulting to ask for napkins since it may be interpreted as being snooty or “nobby” (meaning “nobility)”. Eating without napkins is a British working-class tradition. However, you will find napkins in restaurants and in some homes when Kiwis ask foreigners for dinner.

* Kiwis rarely rinse dish soap off dishes when washing them in a sink. They often let is simply drip dry with the soap on the dishes. Seriously. This habit is toxic.

* People often write reminder notes on their hands instead of paper. They do not use skin color whiteout.

* NZ is one of a handful of countries in the world (mostly among a handful of UK commonwealth nations) where the seasons officially change at the beginning of the month instead of the Equinox or Solstice… so spring begins at the 1st of September, not the 21st.   

* The latitude in the mid-North Island is more or less the same as Madrid, Rome, New York, and Chicago so the low winter light, and high summer light is the same.

* For most, the summer holidays generally are between the end of December to the beginning or middle of January. Schoolchildren return to school by the 3^(rd) or 4^(th) week in January (equal to July in the northern hemisphere).  The country virtually came to a stop during this period. It is called the “silly season”.

There have been several unsuccessful moves in parliament over the years to move the summer season to later in the year in order to coincide with the settled mid to late summer weather.

* Few use screens to keep insects out of homes. Instead, fly spray is often used to kill insects and spiders. It is not uncommon to see someone chasing a fly with a spray can of bug poison.

* No snakes exist in the wild in NZ. A few poisonous spiders can be found in NZ.

They include the rare Katipo spider and a new Australian immigrant, the Red Back. Both are “black pearl” spiders, closely related to the Black Widow. The common, but mildly poisonous White Tail spider may cause allergic reactions that requite antibiotics. 

* Network NZ TV can seem very liberal; words banned on US network TV are allowed on NZ’s non-cable TV. A TV series, or even a station, can start... or suddenly disappear with little notice.

* NZ has an abundance of many seemingly fearsome gangs, including the Hells Angels and the Mongrel Mob - even in small towns. Whanganui a city (population of 40,000) has at least 5 gangs ranging from the Hell’s Angels with an imposing fortified gang quarter to Neo Nazi skinhead gangs to the Mongrel Mob. However, in reality, they are small gangs and generally keep a very low profile; they are far less fearsome than most big-city gun touting US gangs. I have heard reputable reports of Mongrel Mob members stopping to help grannies change their tires.

* The violent crime and murder rate are quite low compared to the USA, but NZ has a fairly high burglary rate.

* Police (other than the “arms offender squad”) don’t carry guns on their person. They are kept in the trunk of their cars. 

* One’s 21^(st) birthday (generally just another uneventful birthday in the USA and Canada) is a monumental rite of passage in NZ. It is often celebrated lavishly with friends and relatives through specific rituals.

* Rabbits are not loveable or cute. In a rural environment, they are to be killed since they compete with stock (farm animals) for grass. The same goes for other imported animals common in NZ such as peacocks, and imported (“exotic”) flowers such as lilies. Indeed, any imported flora or fauna is looked down upon.

* Many people have farm animals in their back yard in rural-like suburban settings (called “lifestyle blocks”). This custom, too is waning.

* Lawns are generally cut shorter than those from North America. When imported from American companies, lawnmowers are adjusted locally to cut lower.

* New Zealand is, in fact more urban than the USA as a percentage of the population.

* About ½ of all Kiwis live within 100 miles of Auckland.

* The word “negro” has not been thought of as offensive. It is still used to describe a person of African or African American origin among older people.

Golliwogs (doll parodies of Africans) are considered cute, not racist. NZ has very few people of African descent.

* “In New Zealand, children start school at age 5… exactly at the child’s 5^(th) birthday. They begin school on their birthday, whenever it happens to fall. That means that throughout the year (the school year follows the calendar year), when a child turns 5, that becomes their first day of school. Imagine the difficulty of planning for that when you have no idea of how many children you will have on any given day.” - See more at -  [http - //www.learningfirst.org/admiring-qualities-schools-down-under#sthash.e1WzSNWZ.dpuf](http://www.learningfirst.org/admiring-qualities-schools-down-under#sthash.e1WzSNWZ.dpuf)

* When teaching, one has to “take leave” during normal vacation time. Leave is often very limited as compared to vacations in North America in academic environments. But leave is very generous in most other work environments.

* High School (generally called “college”) has grades that are quite different than North America, using achieved (A), merit (M), and excellent (E) as a baseline –roughly equal to C, B, and A - though “achieved” can be used in a pass/fail environment.

* Tertiary education (college) in NZ is confusing to Americans. Polytechnics (community colleges and trade schools) and universities can run the same university-level degree, but they are often “worth” differently. Generally speaking, most university courses are 3 years (as they are in most of the world outside the USA). A 4^(th) year “honours year” also exists. Medical school is 6 years as opposed to 8 years in North America. Students choose majors generally when entering university and generally begin specialization in high school. NZ universities are rated fairly high internationally.

* Drip coffee is rare and has largely been replaced by espresso, cappuccinos flat whites (a Kiwi invention) . NZ coffee has been acknowledged to be some of the best in the world) Gourmet drip coffee has made a bit of a comeback in high-end cafes in the last year or so. However instant coffee or tea is the preferred hot beverage in homes and at the workplace.

* People generally use cloth lines instead of dryers.

* Cars may pull over when a hearse passes by to “respect the dead”. It is not a law, but it can be considered insulting not to observe it.  These days, customs occur only in smaller cities and towns with less traffic.

This custom has its roots in the past when horse-drawn hearses were followed by crowds walking to the graveyard in the early 20^(th) century. The newly introduced horseless carriages would occasionally hit people in the funeral procession. 

* Flounder is sold whole, not filleted.

* Avoid talking about “cultural differences”. NZ’ers may take it wrong…they often interpret a discussion of cultural differences as “our culture is better than yours.” ",0,1728251084.0,newzealand,11,0.33,False

I’ve been a barista for close to 10 years working with variations of LM, Synesso and Sanremo alongside mainly Mazzer and Victoria Arduino grinders.

There’s A LOT in the home coffee space and was not planning to purchase a home setup until and if I left the industry and could justify a large purchase.

The setup I ended up purchasing within budget was:
Machine: CREM ONE Profiler
Grinder: Option-O Lagom P64 w/Mizen Omni burrs (I enjoy pour over on my day off and thought this would be a step up from my Ode Gen 1 but give some flexibility)
Basket: Pullman 19-22g
Screen: IMS e61 competition screen (not yet installed)
Puck prep: Grind into Weber Workshops Blind Tumbler and give gentle tap to level bed before tamping.

Never having dialled in the new grinder or used the machine I brought beans from work because I’m familiar with the profile and figured I’d arrive at understanding the new grinder and machine quicker than with beans I’d never tasted. They’re a blend of medium-light roasted Colombia and Ethiopia.

Current workplace is running LM KB90 and Mythos One. 93°C, 2s pre infusion and 9BAR for the length of extraction. 
The recipe we use is 21.5g in, 38g out in 28-32s and anything that runs over 33 seconds tastes over extracted and anything below 27s under extracted. Ground into a Tiamo Dosing cup and shaken into basket.

At home: 
Started with grinder set to 2 - same recipe. Got 38 out in 11s and discarded due to trying to achieve the recipe we have dialled in at work.
Adjusted grinder to 1 - The machine timed out after 90s ish and stopped extracting, wayyy too fine.
Adjusted grinder to 1.5 - 22s, discarded.
2 notches finer, 1.3 - 54s, was about to discard, but the shot looked more like I expected so decided to have a sip expecting over extraction. But surprisingly to me, no bitterness, clean body and all around delicious. Almost licked the cup 😅

What I want to understand is why?
It’s all about flavour at the end of the day so I’m not worried about the extra 20s brew time if this has to be the case, just has me puzzled. 

I still have a lot to learn about the P64 grinder, and the machine. I haven’t confirmed the 0 point on the grinder yet and noticed the machine is topping out extraction at about 8.5 BAR. Is this what will make such a significant time difference? 
I’m also inexperienced with home coffee setups, should I try to push it to 9.5 bar to achieve a 9 BAR extraction? I’ll probably try that today but haven’t tested what the limits are on the pressure settings for the machine yet and I’m still getting my head around the workflow and machine settings. Will do that today at some point…

I’m also surprised at how big the changes are in what I imagined would be small grind adjustments.

Any insights?

You can read my past posts to catch up, but in nutshell, I've been informed by both my christian therapist and pastor that my mexican husband is emotionally abusive, extremely manipulative, and the best choice is to divorce. 

My husband sees it as him trying to help me be the best I can be, giving me everything I need to be successful. I have examples on previous posts that contradict that. When I told him about it being emotional abuse, he said it's the classic American feminist mentality that my therapist is instilling in me, and there are two sides to the tortilla. He said he's always been here for me and wants nothing but the best for me.

Anyway, yesterday there was another 2 hour lecture (he expressed his feelings for literally 2 hours). Usually it makes me sad. He mentioned divorce ( not him divorcing me but me divorcing him). He told me the fact that my therapist thinks he is mentally abusive is crazy and it traumatized him this past week. He said he doesnt hit me or prohibit me from doing most things, so it's not abuse. He didn't get a reaction out of me at all like he usually does (sad and mad).

So after the conversation he acted very differently. He acted nice.

When was that last time he invited me out to do something, besides a coffee? (Maybe April?)
Now suddenly that my parents are coming up for a week, he cares about what I'm doing?

 Today he wanted to get coffee with me. The last time he asked me to get a coffee was at least 2 months ago, probably more. 

Tomorrow, he knows I have plans with my parents...for at least church and lunch. Now, he asks, ""what are you doing tomorrow in the afternoon? I'm in the mood to play pool. Just you and me.""

Hmmmmm, why now suddenly that my parents are coming up? Plus he already said he's going to go to church and possibly lunch with his friends (his own church with his single, younger, friends who are male and female). Now suddenly he wants to change my brakes (one has been shot for 3 weeks) and cut the grass. He'll say its because he didnt have time and money before, but are we sure? Are you sure it isnt because of my parents? Does he not want them to see how it really is?

Why is he now talking to me more today after the original 2 hour conversation...and subtly complimenting me or saying what i want to hear (our son is really interested in basketball. Maybe we can go to the ymca and you can teach him. I told him im not very good at it, but that you are.""

""This chili is really really good. Make sure you dont give it away when everyone's done. If there's any leftover, i want it.""

35 y/o male with a 30 BMI. I’ve had IBS-C for most of my life, however, starting at the end of May, I noticed that I was burping, constipated, and gassy more than usual, especially after eating or drinking. I feel like I have air in the back of my throat, and if I try to hold it in and not let myself burp, it will come out in the form of a single hiccup. Oddly, the burping does not happen if I am laying down.

I originally thought it was my daily coffee, so I excluded that for a couple of weeks but didn’t see any improvement. In July, I went to my gastroenterologist who put me on a 30 day course of Prilosec. That unfortunately did not help either. I also tested negative for Celiac disease. I’ve tried an elimination diet and I’m in my second week of no gluten, which seems to be helping a bit in reducing my burping frequency and the feeling of bloating, although I still am still getting the weird burp/hiccup from time to time.

Although I’m a little better, I’m still a little scared it could be something more serious, so I’m wondering if anyone has had any similar symptoms that turned out to also be caused by gluten sensitivity and, if so, how long they took to go away after going gluten free.

So far, my gastroenterologist does not feel it is necessary to do an endoscopy, as I have no other symptoms that would be consistent with something more serious.

several coffee shops stand out, especially in trendy, fitness-conscious neighborhoods.

	1.	Espresso Vivace (Capitol Hill & South Lake Union): Known for its artisanal coffee and stylish crowd, Vivace draws a mix of professionals and students, many of whom value fitness and outdoor activities like yoga or running. The location in Capitol Hill, known for its vibrant social scene, is a hotspot for meeting young, health-conscious individuals.
	2.	Ghost Note Coffee (Capitol Hill): This boutique shop specializes in creative coffee drinks and tends to attract a crowd interested in both high-quality beverages and fitness trends. Capitol Hill, in general, has a youthful and active demographic, making it an ideal place for people watching and potential encounters.

	3.	La Marzocco Café (Queen Anne): Situated near the Space Needle, this coffee shop offers a lively, hip atmosphere perfect for networking. The area is popular among fitness enthusiasts, with nearby parks often filled with joggers and cyclists.

	4.	Zoka Coffee (South Lake Union, Kirkland): Located in affluent neighborhoods with a higher concentration of young professionals, Zoka attracts a crowd that values both wellness and productivity. South Lake Union, in particular, is known for its tech-savvy, active population.

	5.	Victrola Coffee Roasters (Capitol Hill): Offering a classic Seattle coffee experience, Victrola draws a crowd interested in culture and fitness. Its location near popular gyms and yoga studios adds to its appeal for meeting athletic, like-minded individuals.

A machine where I could learn the art manually while with some automation being available aswell for my wife to use would be preferable.

1fxrdrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/1fxrdrg/psychic_ability_story_would_like_your_opinion/,"Psychic ability story, would like your opinion ","12 years ago I was laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep thinking about what someone had said to me during the day in college that they had enough money  to have me shot, it was an extremely pathetic and desperate person who was jealous of me over a sport. Upon thinking of it and insulted at the idea of being victimised by this fool, my third eye opened and I saw a blast of a vision from the future. 

I jumped out of bed and started writing a stream of consciousness describing events in the future up to 2024 including pandemic, elections, sports events, personal life details etc. It told me lotto numbers for 3 separate draws worth 360 million euro And to give it to 3 different gangs in Ireland where I'm from. It described the death of my cousin including the date and the death of a Spanish girl (rapper Gatta Cattana) including date and cause of death and that she was my soulmate.  I was afraid if I tried to intervene with the plan and  either try to take the lotto numbers for myself or save my cousin or the girl more people close to me would die instead. I asked who was it I was channelling and it said lucifer and that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. I understood that lucifer is a part of God and his plan. It said I would experience christ consciousness and walk in the kingdom of heaven.

 I continued writing things that were not really being channelled but i was including for my audience who would read the note book and for a bit of confusion and mischief. I insulted the gangs and said that I was a peadophile and that I had molested and raped my sister in the past which is not true. The next morning I left the notebook on the coffee table in the living room knowing that my house would be broken into by the creep who threatened me and another older guy from the gym and that they would give the notebook to another guy from the gym who was in a gang mainly because I had the insults in it and bad things about myself. When I came back that day to the house with no notebook I kinda denied that any thing had happened and told myself that I was delusional.

Anyway, all the predictions happened. I remembered everything while smoking weed but ended up getting psychosis and took alot of potent wild psychoactive mushrooms which blasted my mind through eternity . And I wonder if the blast of consciousness from the mushrooms and weed sent my stream of consciousness back in time to tell my self what was going on in the future.  During the time i was recovering from the psychosis was when my cousin died and when i found out about Gatta Cattana and when i did the lotto and looked at the results. 

The 12 year journey had it's ups and downs. There was a rumour spread about me in college and on Facebook that I raped my sister I never saw it because I wasn't on Facebook. But it effected me psychologically I didn't know I started it! I had completely blocked our the channelling from memory. I ended up working jobs that were really stressful and had really bad eczema for six years including on my scrotum which  wasn't painful or irritating but very stressful and mentally draining to have it in an intimate area.

The suffering I endured during the 12 years, from the psychosis and from thinking it was my fault that the 2 people died, led me to be extremely depressed and needing alot of rest for 2 years. Eventually I had a blissful spiritual awakening and heightening of my consciousness, which included a week of powerfull explosions of love from my heart to my head and that the whole experience was the universe waking me up to walk in the kingdom of heaven. 

I would like to hear your thoughts on this story. What do you think the lessons from this experience are? I think my higher self wanted to teach me not to pursue coercive power and to live   a humble, pure and non materialistic life. 

I had a vision that this would happen when I was about 9 years old also. And prayed for strenght, courage, enlightenment and to be a spiritual teacher as a young teenager.

Feed this issue into o1-preview and it gets it.,"**Title: ""The Horizon That Never Arrives""**

The sun peeked through the blinds as John Harper silenced his alarm clock—a physical one, not the virtual assistant that many of his friends used. He stretched and glanced at the news headlines scrolling across his old tablet on the bedside table.

""Another breakthrough in fusion energy,"" he muttered. ""Heard that one before.""

His wife, Sarah, stirred beside him. ""What's that?""

""Just the usual—world-changing tech that's 'just around the corner.'""

She smiled knowingly. ""Maybe it'll arrive before we retire.""

Downstairs, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee greeted them. Their teenage daughter, Emily, was already seated at the kitchen table, scrolling through her social media feed on her smartphone.

""Did you finish your homework?"" Sarah asked, pouring herself a cup.

""Almost,"" Emily replied without looking up. ""Hey, did you hear about the new self-driving cars? They say they'll be available to everyone next year.""

John chuckled. ""They've been saying that since you were in diapers. I'll believe it when I see it.""

He grabbed his keys from the hook by the door—a physical car key, not a digital fob. ""Ready to go?""

As they drove through the suburbs, Emily pointed out a billboard advertising ""The Future of Transportation: Coming Soon!""

""Why don't we ever get the cool stuff?"" she sighed.

John glanced at the congested lanes filled with conventional cars. ""Regulations, safety concerns, you name it. People aren't ready to let go of the wheel, I guess.""

Dropping Emily off at school, John navigated through the morning traffic to his office downtown. He worked at a tech company that specialized in artificial intelligence. For years, they'd been on the verge of releasing an AI assistant that could revolutionize home living. Yet, every time they neared completion, another hurdle appeared—privacy laws tightened, consumer advocacy groups raised alarms, or internal committees delayed approval over ethical concerns.

""Morning, John,"" his colleague Lisa greeted him as he entered the office.

""Morning. What's on the agenda?""

""Another meeting about the AI assistant. Legal wants to discuss the implications of the new data protection regulations.""

John sighed. ""Of course they do.""

In the conference room, the discussion was a replay of countless meetings before. Concerns over user data, potential misuse, and the ever-present fear of AI surpassing human control dominated the conversation.

""We have to be cautious,"" the legal advisor insisted. ""One misstep and we're liable for millions.""

After the meeting, John retreated to his desk, staring at the prototype device that had so much potential yet seemed destined to remain in limbo.

Meanwhile, Sarah was at the hospital where she worked as a nurse. Advances in medical technology promised robotic assistants and AI diagnostics, but red tape and budget constraints meant they still relied on overworked staff and outdated equipment.

During her lunch break, she chatted with her friend and fellow nurse, Karen.

""Did you hear they're testing robotic surgeons in Europe?"" Karen asked.

""Yes, but it'll be decades before we see anything like that here,"" Sarah replied. ""Between the regulations and the unions, it's a long road.""

Back at home that evening, the family gathered for dinner. Emily was excited about a new virtual reality game that promised immersive education experiences.

""They say it'll make learning so much easier!"" she exclaimed.

""Didn't your school ban VR headsets after that incident last year?"" Sarah asked.

Emily rolled her eyes. ""Yes, because a few kids got motion sickness. Now we can't have them at all.""

After dinner, John helped Emily with her homework—math problems printed on paper worksheets. He couldn't help but think about how technology was stuck in a loop of promise and delay.

""Why do we still do everything the old-fashioned way?"" Emily asked, erasing a mistake.

""Change takes time,"" John replied. ""People like what's familiar. Sometimes they're afraid of what new technology might bring.""

""But if it's better, why not use it?""

He smiled. ""Because 'better' isn't always what's easiest to accept.""

Later that night, John and Sarah sat on the porch, watching the stars blink into existence.

""Remember when they said we'd have colonies on Mars by now?"" Sarah mused.

""Yeah, and personal robots to do our chores,"" John added.

She laughed softly. ""Maybe it's not so bad. Some things are worth waiting for.""

""Perhaps,"" he agreed. ""But sometimes I wonder if we're holding ourselves back.""

""Maybe we're just careful.""

""Or maybe we're stuck.""

The streetlights flickered on, illuminating a neighborhood that could have existed fifty years ago. Kids played catch on the lawns, neighbors chatted over fences, and the distant sound of a lawnmower hummed through the air.

As they headed inside, John glanced at the stack of mail on the counter—flyers promising cutting-edge home automation systems, electric cars with endless range, and appliances that could anticipate every need.

""Do you think we'll ever see any of this?"" he asked, holding up a brochure for a smart refrigerator that could order groceries automatically.

Sarah shrugged. ""Maybe. But I'm okay picking out my own vegetables.""

He smiled. ""True. There is something satisfying about doing things ourselves.""

That night, as the family settled into their routines, the world outside buzzed with whispers of innovations that might one day change everything. But for now, life marched on in its familiar cadence—a blend of hopes for the future and the comforts of the present.

In the quiet moments before sleep, John considered the horizon of possibilities that always seemed just out of reach. Perhaps, he thought, the real challenge wasn't the technology itself but the barriers they placed around it—some necessary, others born of fear or complacency.

As his eyes closed, he made peace with the thought that while the world promised flying cars and robotic assistants, there was a certain beauty in the way things were. Maybe the future would arrive someday, but until then, they'd keep living life one day at a time, embracing both the dreams and the realities that defined their world.",0,1728249893.0,singularity,10,0.24,False

It’s raining outside, it sounds nice, a delightful chill runs down my spine, I close my eyes and think of snow.

A hundred thousand regrets, have I gotten stronger or have they gotten lighter, or are they further away or are they closer than ever, who knows, none of that matters so much.

I used to need to know, you know? My questions demanded answers, but I grow tired of asking. I think we can just sit here, no need to fidget, or thrash like a silly fish, you are already in the boat, it’s okay.

I used to need someone to read this, but we can just enjoy it alone, you and I.

What do they know, and how could I ever tell them anyway, that sounds more desperate than I mean, but you get it.

We will just focus on having a nice day, the last few tasks are difficult but achievable. 

We need to untie the last few knots, then we can have a lie down.

Shall I use a metaphor to try to force my rage front and center, it’s not around anymore that often, and I don’t value it so much, It used to be me, but now it’s a byproduct, it’s waste. I only kid. 

I used to make you laugh so hard remember? I do, faintly, let’s make a coffee and try to ignore the discomfort, my organs are failing but that’s okay, It doesn’t hurt as much as you’d think.

And don’t worry about crime and punishment, even I have to sleep sometimes, and they get me then, I can’t run as fast as I used to, and I don't really want to anymore, I imagine soon, I will do quite a lot of sleeping.

I love you, not from this point but from long ago, and like a rock skimmed over water, I still feel the ripples, and they feel different, they make me smile more than they used to.

I’d say I will dream of you, but I don’t get so much say these days, but when I lose myself in the wind or a sunbeam, or a long walk, then I’ll make sure to go through our old photo albums, I hardly recognise these pictures, but whoever this is, it’s a joy to see a smile in front of the… you know. 

I have to go live the 7th of October now, I’ll talk to you again, or maybe you’ll talk to me, you know where to find me.

Have a lovely day.

I’ll finish, with our house would’ve been a very very fine house you know? Life is still so hard. I know how unoriginal, but you know what I’m like, I can’t help but pick and steal at better men. I thought I would’ve been one of them, but.

This would have bothered me alot in the past because it's rare I go on a date with someone that looks way better then their photos look and she doesn't have a single red flag and would definitely make a great girlfriend but I've been on enough dates to just accept we didn't click and to just move on with confidence.

I (m) live with an ex (f). We broke up a few months ago, but she is still on the lease and finishing up school, so she is staying until the semester is over. We share a room which has had its ups and downs in trying to navigate. There have been a couple arguments since the break up but things had mellowed out, until today.

The situation:

A month ago I went on a trip with some friends to another state, and the purpose of this trip really was just to hang out with friends and enjoy a break from work. We walked the town, hiked a few times, and tried out a bunch of restaurants. 

My friend posted a picture of us on our hike and tagged me, so I felt like posting as well and tagging him back. My OTHER ex of almost a decade ago lives in this state now and her mother saw my picture and messaged me suggesting I catch up with my decade old ex. I thought it was a nice idea and asked her to grab a coffee to catch up. We ended up talking for about 4 hours about our families and lives before I eventually headed to the airport and headed back to my home state.

The discovery:

I hadn’t told the ex I’m living with about this because I didn’t want to cause any more arguments. I truly had just grabbed coffee and chatted with the ex in the other state, but I knew the ex I am currently living with wouldn’t see it that way.

This morning as I was waking up, I found the ex I’m living with going through my phone to see if I was saying negative things about her to my friends, but in the process, she found the messages between me and the ex in the other state making plans to grab coffee. 

She questioned me about it and I said we had grabbed coffee and caught up, but nothing more. She says I lied to her because when I was in the other state, I told her I was not seeing anyone else romantically and was not going on any dates. But now she is convinced it was actually a date and that we got physical (which we did not) and is very upset at me, to the point of kicking me out of the shared room. To be fair that’s not an environment I want to be in right now but still…

Basically I think we have very different expectations from our friendship and she has very high expectations of me as her daughter’s godmother, which I simply cannot appease, which in turn makes her very disappointed. 

Very long version of the situation is below.

At the beginning of my career (2018) I met a girl at work (Finance) and we became friendly, at the time she was engaged to her fiancé. We hung out and were close for a year and half. 

In Spring 2019, she met a guy at a clients site, cheated on her fiancé and then broke off the engagement. During that time she also told me she wants to have a child with her new boyfriend ASAP. It was a bit weird but none of my business. The new guy lived an hour away in a different town and she basically kind of moved there. This all happened in summer 2019. 

Fast forward to Fall 2019 she says she’s pregnant and invites us to her birthday. We came, I got a present for her and the baby. After that I didn’t see her at all. We would chat here and there, but no calls no coffee, just texts. She left work pretty early, just took sick leave (there was no high risk to the pregnancy) so I didn’t see her at work either. 

I wasn’t really in any contact with her. After she gave birth she asks me via text to be the child’s godmother. I was a bit shocked since we didn’t know each other long and we weren’t in contact. I was contemplating saying no but everyone around me convinced me it’s not something to decline. So I accepted. At the time I was child free and I also never had much interest in kids and I think it’s something she could have noticed during our time hanging out. Since I accepted I really tried to participate as much as I could in their lives. 

Even then her requests were quite heavy, she always wanted us to come over and stay for hours, mind you just to get there and home was a minimum of 2 hours and she would want us to stay over for hours and hours, so basically half of our day would be spent with those visits (5-6 hours).  She even suggested couple of times that we sleep over. She never had any requests to see me as a friend one to one, it was always partners and kid included. 
I tried as much as I could, but 2021 got busy for me as we were planing our wedding and I also got pregnant. At that time I really didn’t have any time to hang out 5-6 hours. I was busy planing my wedding (which was all last minute because my MIL had cancer and we pushed our wedding earlier) and by the time we were getting married I was 12 weeks pregnant. She again never really showed interest in just having a one to one coffee or anything. After the wedding is the first time she complained that I didn’t see her child enough and that I don’t ask enough about the child. Honestly, I didn’t feel this was valid, but I just let it go. 

After our wedding, COVID really picked back up again and I was wary of who we hung around, and given they socialize heavy all the time I didn’t feel comfortable hanging out. She showed zero empathy and understanding for this and continued to call me out for not being involved enough (even though when she gave birth she was super protective due to COVID, which of course but then extend me the same courtesy). Again, I was already tired of her but just didn’t react. 

I gave birth in June 2022, and we really didn’t have people over at all in the early stages. We had to travel to see my in-laws as my MIL wasn’t fit to travel and we left our city ending July. We basically wanted to give my MIL some time with our child because everyone knew she won’t be here long. This is again something she gave me shit for later ie why didn’t we invite them earlier. They saw my daughter around October, I was wary of this because their daughter was going to kindergarten and I didn’t want my baby to catch something, it’s not the toddlers fault it would have maybe been better if it was just grownups. But I caved to the pressure and they came with the toddler. It was honestly a disaster (the toddler couldn’t handle it, they couldn’t handle the toddler). The whole encounter really left a bad taste for me, and the way they behaved, and I really didn’t initiate much after that. Still my “friend” never initiated any hang out with me or anything. Just more requests to hang kids and all. 

Which brings us to now, I still don’t see them as often as I simply don’t enjoy their company. Her whole identity is around being a mom, cooking and hanging out with people with kids. I’ve never heard her say she’s hanging out with friends. They have a couple of such friends that live close to them and that indulge these long group hang outs and sleepovers. I simply can’t indulge this. My husband and I really always have weekends packed. Between getting things done around the house, shopping, and spending time with my mom and dad, we really have little time, and we mostly hang individually with our friends. All of them are child free, sometimes we hang as couples as well, either a dinner or they drop by for coffee. We also really try and spend a lot of time with my mom as the last couple of years were hard for her (cancer, surgeries, chemo). So as you can imagine, it’s just a packed schedule. 
The other day I got a text again from the friend saying I haven’t seen her daughter in months, she claims it was jokingly but I am just fed up. Yes it’s true it has been months, but I cannot accommodate her suggestions and hang out wishes. It’s also important to note they were basically gone for the whole summer, WFH plus vacation days, they left end of June and came back ending August. We saw them in May for her daughter’s birthday. So I don’t know how we were even supposed to see them. 

I called her out, and she said she has gotten over me not seeing her child, that she has cried over it 200 times, that she has discussed it in confession with her priest and with her two other friends which helped her a lot. 
I honestly never had anyone tell me they cried over me 200 times nor discuss me with a priest. She also says she misses my daughter, which I have a hard time understanding. The only kids I miss are my niece and nephews since they moved 7 hours away, and it’s not like I long for them each day, it’s just I wish they were closer and I love the relationship they have with my daughter. I only have one other friend with a kid, and I honestly don’t miss her kid when I don’t see her. I love to hang out with them, the girls play nicely but I can’t say I miss her daughter, it feels weird. 

At this point I am really ready to cut this. I think for a godchild to have any relationship with the godparent, the parent needs to hold good relationships them selves and she just doesn’t do this. She’s not interested in me or a friendship, she’s just obsessed with the role she gave me. For reference, my daughter also has a godmother, but honestly I prioritize my time with this friend because I really love her and when we have one to one it’s great and relaxing I get to hear what’s up with her. I don’t prioritize her having time with my child while my child is 2. Of course one day she will be a mentor and a good role model for my child and another adult my child can look up to and rely on, but honestly, my daughter is little, she literally forgets people if she doesn’t see them for a month, so I don’t think there is any point to pressure a relationship with a toddler.

So at this point I am really ready to cut this relationship completely off, but I really do want to do it nicely and respectfully. There is no bad blood, it is just obvious she has expectations I can’t match and I am tired of being under pressure. 

I am also curious how people manage such relationships, how much time do you carve out for such hang outs, do you prioritize your friends or more group hanging? Do you feel strongly about your friends kids? Enough to say you miss them? Do you require your own friends to maintain relationships with your kids?",1,1728249624.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

This Texas chili recipe is authentic, meaty, just the right amount of spicy, and not a chili bean in sight. Learn how to make your own Texas chili.

The Best Texas Chili Recipe

The first time I had Texas chili was, shockingly, down in Texas. I was in the middle of my military training and they let me off base. I'd never tried it, so grabbed a bowl at a local restaurant and...

BOOM! Eyes opened! Talk about flavor.

I've been making a version of that exact bowl ever since. Please note that I am NOT a Texas chili purist. There are different ways to make true Texas chili, but this is how I like to make my recipe for Texas chili - with big chunks of beef, lots of pureed chilies and spices, and no beans.
You’ll find argument after argument about what exactly makes up Texas style chili, and as with any recipe, the ingredients and preparation varies from cook to cook.

See my Recipe Variations notes below on this.

The main thing that practically everyone agrees on, however, is that Texas chili has no beans! This is very important. You don’t put beans in Texas chili. See my further notes on that below as well.

Let’s talk about how to make Texas chili, shall we?

How to Make Texas Chili – the Recipe Method

Start your chili paste first by lightly toasting the dried peppers in a dry pan about a minute or 2 per side. This will help to release the oils.

Remove from heat and cool enough to handle. Remove the stems and pour out the seeds.

Soak the peppers in hot water for 20 minutes, or until they are nice and soft.

Add them to a food processor with 1/2 to 1 cup of the soaking water and a bit of salt to taste. Process until nice and smooth. Set aside for now.

Add the cubed beef to a large bowl and toss with the cumin and a bit of salt and pepper. Make sure everything is nice and coated.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot or large Dutch oven over medium high heat and add the beef. Cook 6-7 minutes, searing the beef all over.

Remove the beef and set aside.
Add the remaining olive oil along with the jalapenos, serranos and onion. Cook them down about 5 minutes.

Add the garlic and stir. Cook another minute.

Pour in the reserved chili paste and stir. Cook it for 2-3 minutes to let the flavor develop a bit.

Stir in the beef broth (or beer), 2 cups of water, brown sugar, Worcestershire, and masa and bring to a quick boil. If you are using the optional additions (see my NOTES below), add them in now.

Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. It could take longer if you are using tougher cuts of beef (see NOTES above). Give it a stir once every 30 minutes or so.

NOTE: You could also transfer everything to a slow cooker or Instant Pot and let it cook low and slow. I usually use my Dutch oven.

The chili will thicken up nicely as it simmers.

If it becomes too thick, add in a ¼ cup of water and stir. If it is too thin, thicken with more masa.

Serve with your favorite fixins! Get ready for an awesome ""bowl o red""!

Now, I'm sure you have questions. Or comments. Let's move onto the overall Texas Chili discussion, shall we?

Does Texas Chili Have Beans?

NO! Texas chili does NOT have beans.

However, as with any cook, you are the one making the recipe, so if you'd like to include BEANS in your Texas chili, go for it. Use just about any bean - kidney beans, black beans, several white bean varieties work nicely.

If you choose to include beans, though, be prepared for your Texas friends to tell you, vehemently, that it is NOT officially Texas chili. I'm sure you'll be okay with that.

What Makes Texas Chili Different from Other Chilis?

Texas chili is unique from other chilis in that it does not contain beans or tomato sauce, or any tomato product. It is made primarily of meat and a thick and flavor chili paste made from dried peppers. It is more akin to a thick and hearty beef stew that most chilis with a focus on chili pepper flavor. Because of the reddish color from the chili, it is also known as Texas Red Chili or Cowboy Chili.

About the Dried Peppers

I used a combination of three different dried peppers - ancho, pasilla, and New Mexican peppers.

The ancho pepper is the dried form of the poblano chili pepper. It has a mild paprika flavor, with sweet to moderate heat.

Pasilla peppers offer a rich smoky flavor. They're often used as a powder in Mexican salsas as well as in mole and adobo sauces, though they make a wonderful addition to not only Texas chili, but any style of chili.

The New Mexican peppers are earthy and a little sweet. Together, they build the delectable chili paste that makes this Texas chili recipe truly authentic.

You can easily use other dried pods to form your flavor base, or try it with only a single pepper. I've made some chili recipes with only pasilla peppers and with only ancho peppers, and was not disappointed.

About the Fresh Peppers
I used both jalapeno peppers and serrano peppers for both flavor and heat. They break down nicely as you cook them up, and they're readily available.

Other peppers that would work very nicely here include the Anaheim pepper, cubanelle pepper, or the poblano.

Hatch chili peppers would be outstanding in a Texas chili, in my opinion. If you're looking to introduce a nice level of heat, bring in a habanero or two.

Either work with them from fresh, or roast them for a more robust flavor. Feel free to experiment.

Choices of Beef

Chuck roast is always a popular option for Texas chili because it is a tougher meat that benefits greatly from the low and slow cooking process. I prefer beef chuck. All of that tough connective tissue breaks down and it becomes wonderfully tender and flavorful.

You can use any stew meat for this particular recipe.

I've enjoyed some Texas chilis with ground beef, and found them delicious, but it just isn't the same in terms of taste and consistency. But if you're in a bind, I say go for it. Better to have chili than NO chili.

It is still quite delicious.

As mentioned, there are other ways to make Texas chili, and the recipe will vary from cook to cook. The largest variations I see involve the use of seasonings.

I rely mostly on the peppers, the meat, and a few simple seasonings to make my outstanding Texas chili (if I do say so myself!), but other ingredients I've encountered with other Texas chili recipes include:
* Coriander
* Mexican oregano
* Hot chili powder or flakes (Yes!)
* Vinegar (1-2 tablespoons usually)
* Chocolate or cocoa powder
* Coffee
* Beer (used instead of broth, or both - I've done this and love it)
* Worcestershire sauce
* Brown sugar/sugar
* Tomato paste/sauce/diced tomatoes/crushed tomatoes (usually a typical can or so)
* Masa Harina (as a thickener)

Note that I did not list BEANS among those ingredients.

How Long Does it Take to Make Texas Chili

Once you've got your pot of Texas chili simmering, it will take a least a good two hours of simmering time for the meats to break down, depending on the type of meat you are using. The key is to let the flavor develop, and for the tough connective tissues (collagen) to break down and become tender.

I've had some of my chilis take nearly 4 hours for it to get to where I wanted it, flavor-wise. Just keep tasting and testing.

If your chili becomes too thick from the simmering process and it still needs developing time, just add a bit of water here and there, about a quarter cup or so at a time, as needed.

Speaking of flavor and simmering time...

Try it the Next Day

Texas chili is GREAT right off the bat, but you can develop even MORE flavor by cooling it and setting it into the refrigerator, covered. Leave it overnight, then reheat it the next day.
It is even better this way.

Serving Up Your Texas Chili

I don't see any real RULES here when serving up Texas chili. Serve it up with whatever fixings you prefer. Fritos are fun and crunchy (Frito pie, anyone?), as are crispy tortillas, but go for the regulars like diced onion, spicy chopped peppers, chili flakes, fresh chopped herbs, limes, crema or sour cream, shredded cheese and more.

Storage Info. How Long Does Texas Chili Last in the Fridge?

Properly sealed in a container with a tight lid, chili should last a week in the refrigerator. If you'd like to keep your chili longer, it is best to freeze it in proper freezer containers. That way your chili will last a good 6 months.

That's it, my friends! I hope you enjoy your Texas chili! Let me know how it turns out for you!

Author: Mike Hultquist

Ingredients:
* 3 ancho peppers
* 3 pasilla peppers
* 3 New Mexican dried peppers (See my NOTES above on the dried pepper choices – I prefer a variety)
* 2.5 pounds beef chuck cut into bite-sized cubes
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium white onion chopped
* 3 jalapeno peppers chopped
* 2 serrano peppers chopped (optional for extra heat – use extra jalapenos for milder)
* 4 cloves garlic chopped
* 2 cups beef stock or use a dark beer
* 2.5 cups water + more as needed (or use chicken or beef stock, or beer)
* 2 tablespoons masa harina corn flour, for thickening, if desired
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon Worcestershire
* FOR SERVING: Chopped onion, spicy chili flakes, freshly chopped cilantro, lime wedges, crema or sour cream, Fritos or tortilla chips, whatever else you desire

Instructions:

* Start your chili paste first by lightly toasting the dried peppers in a dry pan about a minute or 2 per side. This will help to release the oils.
* Remove from heat and cool enough to handle. Remove the stems and pour out the seeds.
* Soak the peppers in hot water for 20 minutes, or until they are nice and soft.
* Add them to a food processor with 1/2 to 1 cup of the soaking water and a bit of salt to taste. Process until nice and smooth. Set aside for now.
* Add the cubed beef to a large bowl and toss with the cumin and a bit of salt and pepper. Make sure everything is nice and coated.
* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot and add the seasoned beef. Cook 6-7 minutes, searing the beef all over. Remove the beef and set aside.
* Add the remaining olive oil along with the jalapenos, serranos and onion. Cook them down about 5 minutes.
* Add the garlic and stir. Cook another minute.
* Return the beef to the pot and stir in the reserved chili paste. Cook it for 2-3 minutes to let the flavor develop a bit.
* Stir in the beef broth (or beer), 2 cups of water, brown sugar, Worcestershire, and masa and bring to a quick boil. If you are using the optional additions (see my NOTES above), add them in now.
* Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beef is very tender. It could take longer if you are using tougher cuts of beef (see NOTES above). Give it a stir once every 30 minutes or so. If it becomes too thick, add in a ¼ cup of water and stir. Thicken with more masa.
* Serve with your favorite fixins!

Notes:
Heat Factor: Mild-Medium, but Texas chili is HUGE on flavor.

I figured those friendships were just built for high school and not meant to last long term. This friendship, however, hits differently. 
 
We were really good friends for basically 10 years, and I will say that when I started dating my husband, the friendship shifted.  Not in a bad way. Right after I started dating my husband, I went back to school and started working 2 jobs 7 days a week. I got super busy, and honestly, I feel like we both could've done better with trying to spend more time with one another, but hey, life happens. 

I really noticed that our friendship had changed when she started dating her now fiancé. I messaged her and asked her about him, and she told me that a lot of people didn't know cause she wanted to keep her relationship private. I felt bad cause I knew before this was something she would've immediately told me. I got engaged, and I reached out to her and told her I missed our friendship and really wanted to connect again.  She agreed, and shortly after, she got engaged herself. She did message me pictures and let me know. We also met up for a coffee date once, but I noticed when trying to set that up, it was a lot of ""well if you want to"" between the two of us. I asked her to be a bridesmaid in my wedding. I'm not a bridesmaid in hers, and I completely respect the fact that it's her wedding and her choice, but it still kind of stings. I would love to see her more but I'm also trying to give her some space because her wedding is next month and I know after having my own almost a month ago how stressful planning can be.

Context: FIL has ADHD and we think he is on the spectrum which explains a few things(he refuses to take medication for it). He has not been in a successful long term relationship and has had a difficult relationship at times with SIL. My theory is there's definitely some covert misogyn.

My husband and I have been together for 12 years and we  have a wonderful 5 year old daughter and 2 year old son. 

Before we had kids, my FIL would just do things that I perceived as disrespectful(my husband uses rhe ADHD card excuse but I think it is an excuse to not hold him accountable for an asshole action) that are little slights have added up over time:  not saying thank you for me making coffee/meals, showing up, showing up empty handed and raiding our fridge to eat something (*BTW he is doing pretty alright financially as he's disappearing to the Philippines for a 2nd year in a row for 6 months which is another story), calling MY phone to video call MY kids without acknowledging me, not really talking to me directly, leaving a mess and not helping to clean up while he is staying with us foe visits, JUST started bringing a meal for dinner when he visits (we both work FT and are with young kids) cheaps out on gifts for me when compared to my husband and the kids..I could go on. I realize I also was guilty of just taking it and not saying anything but the past few years ive been working on myself to grow and hold people accountable. Anyways this has been an ongoing issue with him.

We've talked with our counselor about him and we recently talked to him about some separate safety issues that happened the past couple of years he never took accountability with or said sorry for which involved our 2 kids and dog at separate times. We also tried to talk to him about the rest thing with me. It did not go well - he got upset and came after me while we were both talking to him about our concerns. My husband was triggered and didn't really stand up for me. He's been just starting to work on some stuff with his dad as he didn't realize he had daddy issues until well...recently.  Anyways, he did apologize 2 months later for getting mad at after my husband had to be direct and hold him accountable but it hasn't really changed our dynamic of him ignoring me.

My counselor said I need to work on managing my feelings and hurt around everything that has happened and to find some way to not hold onto it. That part I find difficult to just let go of the resentment as well as managing my feelings around the disrespect. 

I have been pointing out things out to my husband around when he does those things to me as he does pick up sometimes and sometimes not. He's been better about 'babysitting his dad/hand holding him' since our talk as he didn't really do that before so i do see that as an improvement. I know he can't control what his dad does or says but it's still hard and it feels lonely to not really feel like he 100% has my back. I even drew parallels today to how he takes me for granted a lot and how similar it is with how his dad treats me.

I'm wondering for others who are/have been in similar situations, how do you manage those feelings of disrespect? 

What else can I talk to or do with my husband as we navigate this moving forward with his dad? Again it's been an ongoing issue pre kids so I'm not optimistic 😕 ",1,1728248850.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/5vxkZTv)


A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - “hey” does not start a conversation. ",1,1728248700.0,r4r,1,0.6,False

1fxqt9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1fxqt9u/you_must_learn_about_the_temporal_and_spatial/,You must learn about the temporal and spatial anomalies known as the Bleed.,"I always imagined the apocalypse would look different. 

More explosions. Fires. Some kind of disaster that you'd watch unfold on television until your eyes ached from the glow. But no, the world doesn’t end with a bang. It ends with a hum—a silent tremor at the edge of perception. You don’t even realize it's happening until you’re in it, drowning in a reality you don’t recognize anymore. 

That’s what the bleed felt like when I first stepped off the chopper. A faint pressure on the back of my neck, as if the air itself was wrong. 

I worked for a clandestine part of the government with the intentionally boring title of The Office of Oversight and Compliance, the OOC. But what they really did was manage temporal and special anomalies. Do you ever feel DeJa'Vu, or find yourself frozen forgetting why you were doing what you were doing? These are just tiny ripples of the effect known as the Bleed. Sources of large rips and tears in reality were quarantined and monitored by the OOC and had been for decades. 

I stood there, squinting at the stark outlines of Westfall Research Station, trying to ignore the low ache in my head. The sun was setting behind the snow-covered peaks, casting long, sharp shadows across the snow-dusted compound. Everything looked normal at first. Quiet, isolated, just like any other government outpost in the middle of nowhere. 

But it wasn’t normal. I could feel it. 

""Beautiful place to lose your mind,"" Dom said, slinging his pack over his shoulder as he stepped up beside me. His voice had the casual tone of someone who's seen too much. Dom was always like that—calm in a way that made me wonder what it took to rattle him. Military background, silent type. He squinted at the facility as if sizing it up for weaknesses. ""They say this place used to be an old mining town. Guess the government decided it'd be perfect to hide out and poke holes in reality."" 

I glanced at him, but he didn’t meet my eyes. Dom didn’t like talking about this stuff much. He was here to do a job. That’s how he saw it, and anything beyond that was irrelevant. 

We started up the path toward the station, the wind biting through my jacket, and the closer we got, the heavier that strange pressure felt. Like gravity had doubled, but only in my mind. I could feel it brushing against my skin, tickling the back of my brain, whispering. The reports we’d read before coming here were vague at best—anomalies in time and space, fluctuations in perception, and disturbances in electromagnetic fields. It had all sounded theoretical until now. 

Cassie, our engineer, had joined us, walking just a step behind. Her voice cut through the air, clear but tinged with tension. ""You feel that?"" she asked. She’d always had a sharp intuition, able to pick up on things the rest of us might miss. Her eyes flicked up to meet mine, confirming my own unease. 

""Yeah,"" I muttered, ""I feel it."" 

Cassie’s hand hovered over the radio clipped to her belt. ""This bleed—it’s already active, isn’t it?"" 

I nodded. ""Has been for a while. We’re walking right into it."" 

The facility was just as cold and sterile as the outside, a maze of concrete and metal corridors lit by harsh fluorescent lights. The entrance hall echoed with our footsteps, and the air inside felt heavier, and thicker. It was as though the walls were too close, the ceiling too low, but only in my head. I kept checking my watch—time felt slippery here, like it could slip through your fingers if you didn’t pay attention. 

We didn’t see anyone as we made our way deeper into the complex. That was the first red flag. The place wasn’t supposed to be abandoned. We’d been sent to investigate a lack of communication, sure, but we were supposed to find a team here. Yet all we got was silence. 

Cassie and Dom split off to check the labs while I headed to what was supposed to be the control room. The farther I went, the worse that pressure got. It was like trying to walk underwater like something invisible was pushing back against every step. My head pounded, but I pushed through, wiping sweat off my brow even though the place was freezing. 

The control room was empty, of course. Banks of computers hummed softly, casting eerie glows over the scattered papers and half-empty coffee cups. The chairs were turned askew as if their occupants had just gotten up and left, but they hadn’t. There was no sign of them. 

I stood there for a long moment, trying to make sense of the space, but my eyes kept drifting, unable to focus. One moment I’d be staring at the monitor, the next I’d realize I was looking at the far wall, with no memory of turning my head. Every blink felt like a flicker, like I was losing time. 

That’s when I heard it. 

A voice. Faint, echoing in the back of my mind. 

""Noah."" 

I spun around, the hairs on my neck standing on end. The room was empty. 

""Noah..."" 

It was a whisper now, familiar. Emily. But it couldn’t be. 

I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to breathe through it. Emily’s dead, I told myself. She’s dead. This can’t be her. But the bleed—God, it was already inside my head, pulling memories, warping perception. It was like it could sense what hurt the most, what you feared the most, and it used it to keep you hooked. 

I reached for my radio. ""Dom, Cassie—how’s it looking over there?"" 

Cassie’s voice crackled back. ""Labs are a mess, Noah. Looks like they left in a hurry. Some of the equipment’s still running, but... there’s something off about it. It’s hard to explain, but I don’t think time’s moving right here."" 

Dom chimed in next, his voice tense. ""I’m checking the barracks. Same thing here—no sign of anyone. Feels like I’m walking through molasses. You good?"" 

I wasn’t. But I didn’t say that. 

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""Meet me back at the control room. We’ll figure out what to do next."" 

When Dom and Cassie arrived, their faces mirrored my own confusion. Something was wrong with all of us, something we couldn’t quite name yet. Cassie’s eyes were wide, darting around the room like she was trying to see something that wasn’t there. Dom was quieter than usual, more on edge. 

""What the hell is happening here?"" Dom asked, running a hand through his short-cropped hair. ""Feels like we’re losing it."" 

""It’s the bleed,"" Cassie said, her voice tight. ""It’s worse than we thought. We’re already in it. I think it’s affecting us more the longer we stay."" 

I didn’t want to believe it. I wanted to think there was some rational explanation for all of this, that we could find the missing team and get the hell out of here. But deep down, I knew Cassie was right. This wasn’t just some glitch in time or space. The bleed was real, and it was twisting us, pulling us apart piece by piece. 

""We need to find the others,"" I said, more to keep myself grounded than anything. ""Whatever’s happening here, we need answers."" 

Cassie nodded, but there was doubt in her eyes. ""What if they’re already gone? What if the bleed—"" 

""We’re not giving up yet,"" Dom interrupted, his voice firm. ""We find the team, we get the data, and we leave. Simple as that."" 

Nothing about this was simple, but I kept that to myself. We left the control room and ventured deeper into the facility, navigating the maze of halls and rooms that seemed to stretch on forever. Every door we opened led to more confusion—empty labs, abandoned equipment, eerie silence. 

And the voices. God, the voices were everywhere. Sometimes I heard Emily’s soft whisper, sometimes it was a cacophony of whispers that echoed through the halls, pulling at my sanity. I knew Dom and Cassie were hearing things too, but we didn’t talk about it. We couldn’t. 

It was when we reached the observation deck that things really went to hell. 

 

The observation deck overlooked the area where the team had been studying the bleed itself. A massive containment field surrounded the anomaly, flickering in and out like static on an old television. The air felt heavier here, like gravity was pushing down on us from all sides. 

And then I saw it. 

At first, it was just a shimmer in the air, like heat rising off asphalt in the summer. But as I stared, it grew, warping and twisting until it became something more. The air around it pulsed, distorting the space in strange, unnatural ways. 

Cassie gasped, stepping back. ""Do you see that?"" 

I did. But it wasn’t just the anomaly anymore. Beyond the flickering field, I saw something moving—something wrong. It was like looking at a broken reflection, a twisted version of reality. And in the center of it all, there were people—the missing team, or at least versions of them, trapped in the shifting space. 

But they weren’t moving. They were frozen, caught in some kind of temporal stasis, their faces contorted in silent screams. And then they began to flicker, like they were fading in and out of existence. 

""Noah,"" Dom said, his voice tight with fear. ""We need to go. Now."" 

But I couldn’t move. I was rooted to the spot, staring at the figures as they flickered between realities, between dimensions. It was as if the bleed was showing us a glimpse of what it could do—what it would do to us if we stayed too long. 

Cassie grabbed my arm, pulling me back to reality. ""Noah! We have to go!"" 

I blinked, tearing my eyes away from the horrific scene. My heart was pounding, my mind reeling. ""We... we need to shut it down,"" I muttered. ""Before it consumes everything."" 

Dom shook his head. ""We’re not shutting anything down. We’re getting out of here."" 

But as we turned to leave, the air around us shifted, and I felt it again—that sickening pull, like the bleed was reaching out, wrapping its fingers around us. I heard Emily’s voice again, soft and pleading. 

""Noah... don’t leave me."" 

And then the world twisted. 

Reality bent around me as if I had stepped into a reflection that didn’t quite match the original. The floor beneath my feet stretched and warped, the walls elongating like taffy in my peripheral vision. I could still hear Cassie and Dom shouting, but their voices seemed distant—muffled by something that wasn’t just the air. It was like the bleed itself had thickened between us. 

""Noah!"" 

Dom’s voice came in sharp and clear, cutting through the disorientation. He grabbed me by the shoulders, his grip strong, shaking me hard enough to snap me out of the momentary daze. ""Focus!"" His eyes were wide, his usually calm demeanor cracking under the strain of whatever this place was doing to us. 

I took a deep breath, steadying myself as the world seemed to snap back into place, though the sensation of wrongness remained. We were still inside the bleed’s grasp, but at least I could tell where I was again. For now. 

""We’ve got to move,"" Dom said, his voice low, urgent. ""We’re sitting ducks if we stay here. The bleed’s already playing with our heads."" 

I nodded, feeling the dull ache behind my eyes intensify. ""Where’s Cassie?"" 

""She went to grab the portable stabilizer from the lab,"" Dom said, glancing over his shoulder as if expecting the room to shift again at any moment. ""If we can at least slow this thing down, we might be able to—"" 

A sudden scream cut through the air, sharp and gut-wrenching, echoing down the corridor. It was Cassie. 

Without thinking, Dom and I bolted toward the source, sprinting down the hall that now seemed twice as long, the walls flickering like a half-remembered dream. My heart pounded in my chest, adrenaline overriding the surreal disorientation that tried to pull me under. 

We rounded the corner and found Cassie in the lab. She stood in the center of the room, trembling, her eyes wide with terror, staring at something that wasn’t there. Or maybe it was there, but only to her. 

""Cassie!"" I rushed to her side, my hands on her shoulders, shaking her gently. ""What’s wrong? What did you see?"" 

Her lips moved, but no sound came out at first. Then, slowly, her eyes met mine. ""It’s… it’s in my head, Noah. I saw…"" She trailed off, her voice cracking as tears welled up in her eyes. ""It showed me something. A memory. But it wasn’t mine."" 

I glanced at Dom, who looked as lost as I felt. ""What do you mean, it wasn’t yours?"" 

Cassie shuddered, wiping at her face, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. ""It was someone else’s life. A woman—her whole life, in flashes. Her first kiss, her wedding day, her child being born. But… then it got worse. She lost her child, her husband. There was so much pain, Noah. I felt it all. Like it was my own. But I’ve never had any of that."" 

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. The bleed was pulling memories from somewhere—whether from people lost inside it or from alternate realities, it didn’t matter. It was invading us, digging deep into the most vulnerable parts of our minds, forcing us to live lives that weren’t ours. 

""We can’t stay here,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It’s getting stronger."" 

Dom nodded, his face pale. ""We’ll grab the stabilizer and head back to the control room. If we can at least slow this thing down, maybe we’ll have time to figure out what the hell is going on."" 

We didn’t talk much after that. It was like we all knew that words wouldn’t help—there was no logic, no reasoning with the bleed. It was alive, in a way that made it all the more terrifying. And it was hungry. 

Dom took the lead, his rifle slung over his shoulder, as we moved through the facility. I couldn’t shake the feeling that time had stopped meaning anything. My watch still ticked, but when I looked at it, I wasn’t sure if minutes had passed or hours. The hallways seemed to loop back on themselves, the same doors and rooms repeating endlessly, like we were trapped in a nightmare with no exit. 

And then there were the flashes. 

They came suddenly, without warning. One moment, we were walking down a corridor, and the next, I was somewhere else—somewhen else. I’d blink and find myself standing in a house I didn’t recognize, watching a woman I’d never met cry at her kitchen table. I could hear her sobs, feel the crushing weight of grief that surrounded her. Then I’d blink again, and I was back in the facility, with Dom and Cassie, my heart pounding in my chest. 

Dom was having them too—I could tell by the way his eyes kept darting to the corners of the room, like he was seeing something just out of sight. Cassie clutched the stabilizer to her chest, her knuckles white, her breath coming in shallow gasps. 

The bleed wasn’t just distorting space anymore. It was playing with time, pulling us into moments that weren’t ours, forcing us to experience them like echoes of lives we didn’t live. 

""We’re close,"" Dom muttered, his voice strained. ""Just ahead."" 

But the moment we stepped into the next room, everything shifted again. 

The world around me dissolved into a chaotic swirl of colors and sounds. I felt like I was falling, tumbling through an endless aetheric void where nothing made sense. It was as though the very fabric of reality had torn open, and we were caught in the gap between. 

When the world snapped back into focus, I wasn’t in the facility anymore. 

I stood on a street corner in a city I didn’t recognize, surrounded by people I’d never seen before. Cars zoomed by, their horns blaring, and the smell of street food filled the air. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the pavement. 

But something was wrong. 

The people… they weren’t moving. They stood frozen in place, mid-stride, their faces locked in expressions of joy, anger, confusion. It was like someone had hit pause on the world. 

And then I heard her voice again. 

Emily. 

She stood across the street, her back to me, just as I remembered her—before the accident. Before everything went wrong. My heart clenched in my chest as I took a step toward her, my throat tight with a mix of hope and dread. 

""Emily!"" I called out, my voice barely more than a whisper. ""Emily, wait!"" 

But she didn’t turn. She didn’t move at all. 

I broke into a run, weaving through the frozen figures around me, my mind screaming that this wasn’t real, that it couldn’t be real. But my heart wouldn’t listen. I had to reach her. I had to— 

And then I was yanked back. 

The world twisted, snapping me out of the illusion and throwing me back into the cold, sterile facility. I stumbled, gasping for breath, as Dom’s hand gripped my arm. 

""Noah!"" he shouted, his voice urgent. ""Stay with us, man! It’s not real!"" 

I blinked, disoriented, my heart still racing from the encounter. Emily was gone. Of course she was. She’d been gone for years. But the bleed… it was using her, using my memories, my emotions, to keep me hooked. 

""We have to shut this thing down,"" I muttered, shaking off the lingering haze. ""Before it takes any more of us."" 

Dom nodded, his jaw clenched tight. ""We’re almost there."" 

When we reached the core of the facility, it was clear we were at the heart of the bleed. The room pulsed with energy, the walls shifting in and out of focus, as if they couldn’t decide what they were supposed to be. In the center of the room was the source—the anomaly we’d seen on the observation deck, now expanded, growing like a living thing. 

And inside it, I could see something. An entity, vast and incomprehensible, its form constantly shifting, never quite solid. It wasn’t like anything I’d ever seen before—like the bleed itself had given birth to something that shouldn’t exist. 

Cassie set the stabilizer down, her hands shaking as she worked to activate it. ""This should at least stop it from spreading,"" she said, her voice unsteady. ""But we need to figure out how to shut it down completely."" 

I stared at the entity, my mind struggling to comprehend what I was seeing. It was like looking into the void, into something that didn’t belong in our world. It felt ancient, powerful, like it had been waiting for us to find it. 

""We can’t shut it down,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Not really. It’s not just a thing. It’s… it’s alive."" 

Dom frowned, stepping closer. ""What do you mean, alive?"" 

I shook my head, trying to make sense of the thoughts swirling in my mind. ""The bleed—it’s not just an anomaly. It’s part of something bigger. Something we can’t understand. And now that we’ve found it… it’s not going to let us go."" 

The realization hit me like a cold wave, sharp and numbing. The bleed wasn’t just a phenomenon—it was part of something far greater, and by interacting with it, we had become entangled in its grasp. The more we tried to understand, the deeper we sank into its folds, feeding it with our curiosity, our fear, and our memories. 

Cassie’s hands were still trembling as she worked, her fingers clumsy over the stabilizer’s controls. ""We don’t have much time,"" she muttered, barely audible over the hum of the entity at the room’s center. ""This thing’s destabilizing faster than we thought. If we don’t activate this now, it’s going to consume the whole facility."" 

The entity inside the anomaly twisted and shimmered, like a ripple on the surface of a bottomless ocean. It felt as though it were watching us, though it had no eyes. It simply existed, an unfathomable intelligence that had grown from the dimensional bleed. 

Dom stepped up beside me, his face pale but determined. ""If we can’t shut it down, we can at least contain it. We have to stop this thing from spreading any further. Whatever it is—it’s feeding on us."" 

I nodded, my thoughts racing. He was right. The more we struggled, the more the bleed seemed to adapt, warping our perception, forcing us to relive moments we couldn’t control. It wasn’t just a distortion of time and space—it was learning from us, growing stronger as it absorbed our memories, our emotions. 

But something tugged at the edges of my mind, a thought that had been gnawing at me since we first encountered the anomaly. I couldn’t shake the feeling that this was a cycle. It had happened before—and it would happen again. 

""We’re not the first,"" I said, my voice hoarse as the realization crystallized. ""This has happened before. People have come here, explored the bleed, tried to understand it—and it consumed them. It’s… part of the pattern."" 

Dom glanced at me, his brow furrowing. ""What are you saying?"" 

""I’m saying the bleed—it doesn’t just distort reality. It creates it. Or at least, it creates a version of it. Every time someone tries to explore it, they leave a part of themselves behind, and the bleed takes it, merges it with itself. That’s why we’re seeing all these memories, these lives that aren’t ours. We’re walking through the remains of everyone who’s come before us."" 

Dom’s expression darkened as he took in my words. ""So, what? There’s no way out?"" 

Cassie looked up from the stabilizer, her face tight with fear. ""We have to try. If we can at least stop it from growing—"" 

The room shuddered, a deep, resonant pulse that rattled the walls. The entity inside the anomaly expanded, its form stretching, reaching toward us like the tendrils of some vast, incomprehensible mind. The lights flickered, and for a moment, I thought I could hear a low, thrumming hum—a voice that wasn’t a voice, reverberating in the air around us. 

It knew we were here. 

Cassie managed to activate the stabilizer just as the entity seemed to surge forward, its presence pressing down on us like a weight, thick and suffocating. The machine hummed to life, casting a blue glow that rippled through the room. For a moment, the walls stopped shifting, the distortions in time and space slowing. 

""We’ve bought ourselves some time,"" she said, wiping sweat from her brow. ""But it’s not enough. The bleed’s still too powerful. We need a way to sever it completely."" 

Dom stepped closer to the anomaly, his eyes narrowing as he studied the entity. ""There’s got to be a way to collapse it. Something that’ll cut the connection between this world and… whatever that thing is."" 

I stared at the anomaly, my mind racing. If the bleed was tied to this larger, unknowable entity, then maybe the only way to stop it was to break that connection. But how? It was like trying to cut the strings of a puppet without being able to see the strings. 

And then it hit me. 

""The memories,"" I said suddenly, my voice rising as the pieces fell into place. ""It’s using our memories, our emotions, to hold itself together. Every time it takes a piece of us, it strengthens the connection. But if we stop feeding it—if we break the cycle—maybe we can collapse the bleed."" 

Dom’s eyes flicked to me, a flicker of understanding dawning. ""You mean we have to let go."" 

""Exactly. We’ve been fighting it this whole time, trying to hold onto who we are, but that’s what’s keeping us trapped. The bleed isn’t just distorting reality—it’s creating a new one, based on everything we’re bringing into it. If we let go of those memories, if we sever our emotional connection to them, maybe we can stop it from expanding."" 

Cassie’s face twisted in confusion. ""But how? How do we just… let go?"" 

""I don’t know,"" I admitted, the enormity of what I was saying settling over me like a weight. ""But it’s the only way. If we don’t, we’ll just keep feeding it until it takes us completely."" 

Dom stared at the anomaly, his jaw tight. ""Then we do it. We find a way."" 

It wasn’t as easy as flipping a switch. Memories don’t just fade because you will them to. They’re part of you, woven into the very fabric of your identity. But in that moment, standing on the edge of an abyss I couldn’t fully comprehend, I realized I had no other choice. 

I had to let go of Emily. 

The thought tore at me, a physical pain in my chest, but I knew it was the only way. I had carried her with me for so long—her memory, her death, the guilt that had haunted me every day since. It had shaped who I was, driven me to make choices that had led me here, to this moment. But now, it was also the thing keeping me trapped in this place, in the bleed. 

I closed my eyes, breathing deeply, trying to center myself. The entity inside the anomaly pulsed, as if sensing what I was about to do. It wasn’t going to make this easy. 

""I’m sorry,"" I whispered, the words catching in my throat. ""But I have to let you go."" 

And then, like a dam breaking, the memories came flooding back—every moment I had spent with her, every laugh, every tear, every fight. The good and the bad, all of it crashing over me like a tidal wave. But I didn’t push it away. I let it come, let it wash over me, let it tear me apart. And slowly, painfully, I let it go. 

The pressure in the room shifted, the air growing heavy with the weight of the entity’s presence. I opened my eyes and saw that Dom and Cassie were doing the same—reliving their own memories, their own losses, their own fears. And as they let go, the entity began to shrink, its tendrils recoiling, its form flickering. 

It wasn’t enough to destroy it completely. But it was enough to weaken it. 

The anomaly pulsed one last time, a final burst of energy that shook the room. The walls shimmered, the floor beneath us rippling like water. And then, with a sudden, jarring snap, the bleed collapsed in on itself, the entity vanishing into the void from which it had come. 

We were thrown to the floor as the stabilizer overloaded, sparks flying from the machine as it short-circuited. The lights flickered, and for a moment, I thought the whole facility was going to come down around us. 

But then, silence. 

I blinked, dazed, as I pulled myself to my feet. The room was still, the walls solid once more. The bleed was gone. 

Dom groaned as he stood, clutching his side. ""Is it over?"" 

Cassie nodded, her face pale but relieved. ""It’s over."" 

I looked around, still half-expecting the walls to start shifting again, but they didn’t. The air was heavy with the smell of burnt circuits, but it was real. Solid. We had made it. 

But as we stumbled out of the room, exhausted and battered, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we hadn’t won. Not really. 

The bleed was gone, but the entity was still out there, somewhere. And it would wait. It always did. 

\*\*\* 

Weeks later, I sat at my desk, staring at the report I had been writing, trying to make sense of everything that had happened. The facility was in lockdown, the OOC sweeping it under the rug, as they always did. The official story was a containment breach. Nothing more. Nothing the public needed to know about.  

But I knew the truth. It’s why I feel compelled to write and distribute this to you the reader out there who might stumble upon it.   

I had survived the bleed, but it had left its mark on me. The memories I had let go of were gone, but the scars remained. And somewhere, out there in the vast unknown, the entity waited, biding its time. It was not a Sword of Damocles hanging over me, it is our entire species at risk.  

The entity was like a virus, infecting us, hoping to spread itself further. Why I cannot comprehend, perhaps no human can. I wonder then, deep down, what things might have been like if we were all clear headed, not weighed down by the struggles of existence? Would the bleed instead reflect back to us something positive? 

I shake my head. I had no doubt it would return, more bleed sites always appeared. We hadn’t destroyed it. We had only delayed the inevitable. 

But I also knew that when it did return, we wouldn’t be ready. 

We never are because of what we cling onto.

I want to feel motivated to put in effort again/feel like having a human connection is possible.**

I apologize in advance as this is going to be long.

Hi, I'm 23M living in a city and I really just don't understand the way I feel regarding making friendships. Mainly, I currently have nearly no real friends (people who I share connections/feel deeply about) other than a few acquaintances I've made throughout life, and despite attempting, have continued growing away from. I'm at a point where I desperately want to put myself out there to make new friends by talking to people, joining clubs, pickleball, etc. , but simultaneously don't want to speak to anyone anymore. It isn't even a matter I feel of being shy, it's when I think about doing it, part of myself just doesn't want to and thinks of socializing almost as a chore. It's like in reality I just want to be alone, but without this deep longing for human connection.

Some background: since childhood I've had incredible difficulty, not making, but maintaining friendships, almost always for reasons outside of my control. Made a best friend in preschool, then our parents had us go to rival elementary schools so I had to make new friends. Then, for nearly every single year elementary through the end of 8th grade, I would make a new friend, grow close to them, only for them to move away at the end of the year. It's honestly incredible that I had this string of bad luck where every close friend I made moved away. In high school, I ended up becoming ""friends"" with a group of people who bullied me horribly, and I think the only reason I hung out with them through high school was Stockholm syndrome. I finally cut them off when I went to college.

In college, at first, things were great. I made friends with a ton of people on my dorm floor and simultaneously a bunch of people from my hometown who I graduated with. Then again, all goes to shit. COVID happened, and just like that, everything became virtual and the majority of friends I had made grew apart as we were no longer in person. What's more, a bunch dropped out, transferred, until I was left with only my roommates. As for my friends at home, I met my GF through them and shortly after, at a party, we had a major falling out (without going into it, this I will take partial responsibility for, although not the majority). So at this point, it's essentially me, my GF, and a small handful of college friends. College friends then start having severe anger/emotional issues, which leads to us growing apart.

So then it was just me and my GF, until she introduced me to her friend group. And honestly, these were my people, and we all got along very well and had fantastic chemistry. Not to mention, my GF was absolutely my best friend. Everything went smoothly for years, until our relationship began to decline, and she ended up cheating on me, taking advantage of me, and leaving me (we lived together). What's more, the devastation of the relationship basically ended my chance of ever spending time with those other friends of hers I made, as they were hers to start with and honestly it would've felt super weird to continue spending time with them. Out of the 20+ of them I was friends with, 1 reached out to me after the breakup and although he lives hundreds of miles away, we do still stay in contact online. As for the others, it was kinda crushing that after knowing them for years, not a single one said a single word to me after the breakup and acted like I never existed in the first place.

So that was a year ago and brings us to where I am today. I have one semi-close friend who lives near me in the city, but he is going to grad school in a year in another state so he too will leave. I've been depressed, been in/out of therapy and on depression meds which have helped significantly, but I still just feel like there's no point in trying anymore socially. Every friendship I form seems to be stolen from me either by sheer bad luck or unfortunate falling outs. I know that I could join clubs, go to new coffee shops, meet people, etc. I have bumble for friends where I get matches like crazy with people who I feel like I would genuinely like to meet IRL. But I just don't care or feel motivated to do so. I feel entirely burned out of putting too much myself into too many failed relationships. I feel as though mentally I want to form friendships, but my body is telling me no.

I've always been the one to put in most of the effort in friendships, which is I feel another part of it. I feel like I just need someone who will take care of me for a change, at least for a little, just putting in some effort in the beginning of the friendship while I have time to catch my breath. I'm just so tired of putting all the work in all the time, because when I don't the relationships fall apart. I'm so tired of having to change friends every year, when there are so many people who have had the exact same best friend since childhood.

Outside of this I'm living the life I want. I have a great job with great growth in a city I like. I'm saving money so I can either move to a new city in a few years or possibly buy a house (who knows right now). I have solo hobbies (music, reading, etc.) that I find fulfilling and I'm exploring the idea of taking up other things like skiing this winter. But honestly, not having any fulfilling relationships or nobody to truly lean on leaves a gaping hole in my heart.

I feel like a big part of this was the loss of my relationship, as she was the closest friend friend I've ever had even outside of the romantic aspect. The loss of her in my personal life, as well as the betrayal I felt, not only put me into what feels like a constant state of shock, but basically numbed me out of being able to feel a connection with anyone. To put it bluntly, I feel like I just don't care about other people in the slightest anymore, I simply want the feeling of loneliness to go away.

I don't really know what this means or how to go about addressing it. Like I've said, I'm currently on depression meds and trying to find a new therapist (last therapist ghosted me after only a few sessions, love that), but I want to address the underlying issues instead of just managing my depressive symptoms. I want to feel connected to people again, I want to feel the desire to put myself out there. I just want to want to form connections again.

Edit: Forgot to add, I have put myself out there already. I've been to coffee shops, met people I have similar interests with, been to clubs. Even with good, positive interactions with others, great conversations, I simply do not care about trying to turn it into a new relationship. The actual act of forming the relationship isn't what I lack, it's any internal drive whatsoever to go about creating it. After talking to someone about something I love, I would literally rather just go home and sit by myself than put effort into another interaction with them.",2,1728248517.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

1fxqsx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stomachcancer/comments/1fxqsx2/burping_a_sign_of_stomach_cancer/,Burping a Sign of Stomach Cancer?,"Hi everyone-

35 y/o male with a 30 BMI. I’ve had IBS-C for most of my life, however, starting at the end of May, I noticed that I was burping, constipated, and gassy more than usual, especially after eating or drinking. I feel like I have air in the back of my throat, and if I try to hold it in and not let myself burp, it will come out in the form of a single hiccup. Oddly, the burping does not happen if I am laying down.

I originally thought it was my daily coffee, so I excluded that for a couple of weeks but didn’t see any improvement. In July, I went to my gastroenterologist who put me on a 30 day course of Prilosec. That unfortunately did not help either. I also tested negative for Celiac disease. I’ve tried an elimination diet and I’m in my second week of no gluten, which seems to be helping a bit in reducing my burping frequency and the feeling of bloating, although I still am burping. The gastroenterologist does not feel an endoscopy or CT scan is necessary at this time, as I have no other symptoms that would indicate stomach cancer like pain, vomiting, or blood in my stools, other than a dull pain in my lower left gut when I am constipated, which she also says is consistent with constipation.

Wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences? Should I push my gastroenterologist to perform an endoscopy and/or CT scan, or find another one? I certainly want to be an advocate for my health, but I know my symptoms are more likely to be from gluten intolerance and being overweight.

I’d appreciate anyone’s feedback, and I apologize if this post is out of place, as I know there are many people here who are dealing with confirmed cases of stomach cancer, or having symptoms that are much more serious.",1,1728248496.0,stomachcancer,0,1.0,False
1fxqruq,https://youtu.be/JE7AE2dxYLw?si=q5dqKId5rfvHm-LW,Interesting Lone Fox Video today… 🤔,"I’m not here to recommend Drew again, but by watching his “Day In My Life” video, I was laughing during the whole first half because it was like a parody of someone we know:

- 7:45 am time stamp (written bigger so we can read it)

- In his bed like M, but much less fake, and cuddling his dog.

- He FaceTime his Mum every morning (but for a good reason: they are working together). 

- Making his bed, showing his cold coffee.

- Showing his Snif candles: “the only candles he likes” he said. 

- Then searching for some music and we hear a voice saying: “I am unsubscribing from this drama!” and he laughed.

- Then, presenting his team, and about Justin who is actually an employee, not just a friend he said: “Sometimes, when I’m finishing a project on camera, it’s actually Justin and you don’t even know it! Ah! Ah!” 🤭 Does it make you think of something? 🤫

- Then, showing his little oven, styling his hair, showing some Nivea cream (which was originally French), doing his eyebrows and beard with some eyeshadows, (filmed exactly like M would film it). 

- But the second half is basically what M. should do and she doesn’t: buying some new fabrics but restraining himself to the clearance section, he shows how he does his Christmas shooting for his online shop already now, he encouraged Justin to have his own booth because he’s not a selfish bast..d, he does some networking by going to an event where he was invited, he edits his video in the evening so he can voice over it the next day. He basically is showing that it takes a village to do a very good job and he works a lot beforehand. ",8,1728248423.0,XOMaCennaUnfiltered,4,0.9,False

Late August [I received this pair from Anonymous](https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=6156630954&spider_token=7b70).

As you can see, the brown panels are really light, and there are some color differences between the green and red panels.  The green and red also in hand was really bright and didn't have that worn and weathered look.

  
**Step 1 - Coffee and Tea bath**

I started the whole process by removing the laces an the insoles.  I had an old bag of decaf coffee I had bought by mistake and bought a cheap box of tea bags. 

https://preview.redd.it/h26p8ufi57td1.jpg?width=2317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=448cee7a930eea17cbbc31c7b4dec63410b17d9c

I would fill a pot with water, some coffee and tea bags and would heat it.  Don't boil it.  You want the water just hot enough that it starts to release the coloring but not to scorch it or be hot enough you can't put the shoes in it.  Keep the water between 160-180 degrees.

https://preview.redd.it/5uxucufi57td1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d54c637040e95b07c24079ebab491417060a4282

To fully submerse the shoes I ended up using about 10 gallons of water, the full bag of coffee and about 15 teabags.  It's not an exact science.  You'll need something heavy to weigh the shoes down because they'll float in the mix.  I had a few yard stakes that i was able to set in the shoe that worked great because they didn't lean against the shoe at any point either.

https://preview.redd.it/lk2pjufi57td1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5e97c626c2096d4af9bae504392b9510fd52b27

After about 6 hours soaking I took them out.  You could leave them in longer or shorter...again not exactly rocket science.  The main goal with this was to darken and even the coloring on the green/red panels.

https://preview.redd.it/fmty070e67td1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee98ba2f1e6d067be099887a0d9273d4359f1dbb

Rinse the shoes with clean water.  Don't scrub them and don't use soap, just rinse the coffee grounds off and then set them out in the sun to dry.  The drying process took forever, felt like a good 2 days for them to really get dry.

https://preview.redd.it/p1tjy60e67td1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c36a32c9cda6b558f5359bd231bf28d0b64c7f5

Midway through the drying process I noticed the coffee/tea was coming to the top of the fabric on the inside, so I grabbed some Dawn dish soap and ran them under the kitchen faucet to get those ugly stain lines out.

https://preview.redd.it/0lw2ev0e67td1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bedcd4df5d1d9ebbad5d10321835b3e4aaecb72

Here they are completely dry.  You can see that the coffee/tea mix also left some stain lines on the brown panels which is kinda nice because eventually it'll give them a more weathered look.

**Step 2: Oil and make em dirty**

Next is a rub down with some oil.  Now....if you have some, used oil would be better for this use case because it's darker.  Regular motor oil has a yellowish tint to it. I applied 2 coats using the oil and a kind of clean shop rag.  Didn't do a whole lot.  So I took the rag and wiped down the tires on my truck which added some blackened staining effect.

https://preview.redd.it/v2ysb79e77td1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18b944b5eeed748305ca65b0f99aec2da11dbbfd

After about the 4th coat of oil and dirt they were looking better.

**Step 3: Suede brush and paint**

My final step was to hit them with a suede brush. Not only did it help to rough up the material but it gave them a more lifelike feel and the nubuck got a little movement to it.  Not a ton, but enough.  I used a [regular suede brush off amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Shacke-Suede-Nubuck-Leather-Cleaner/dp/B00IIFFEPU/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1MUIB91258HSC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3hUTVEZg3ddjV8DK3AE4mc9mpK2vkFd_qiFLy_BEz6WzM8cDZlIWEcvuj7LXdeyfqHrfhUHNpidvIRRegHPjKqIbP82zK9LvnBhhzHvhvlKQLDxbAWF5hbJWLHuH7037NQgiv_w-nW92LZuY_pUGZ-GvTzh1IhzNZNcqWG27UAZKZnb3201YUnO223QyQ8argL3IIRGz5IP9LP_EloQClaG5A9TNGniaMLA3jlQbp-l5yPfozskTU2rDF8fwi1ezct-HhVQj6Ck9Qli6bIj0MsaoxojzqapD8bqhTJHLC7o.RNDFTHS1CSNFz2YjJvouqpU1XXjaYTIaHxwzju61ss8&dib_tag=se&keywords=suede+brush&qid=1728247934&sprefix=suede+brush%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-5).  After brushing, the blood spatters were super dark, like almost black.  So I wanted to give the blood some life.  I had some Angelus paint, but only had Fire Red and Black.  So i made a 4/1 Red/Black mix (4 drops red to 1 drop red).  If i could do this part again I'd mix the paint different...I'd probably do like a 4/1 mis of Red and purple to give it a deeper color.  Kinda had to go with what I had.  Traced out the existing spatters.  Finished off the blood paint with an Angelus satin finisher to give it a little shine.  Since the color was a brighter red than I wanted, I figured the satin shine would make it look ""fresh"".

  
Final Product

1fxqomd,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/1fxqomd/finally_calmer_after_my_last_post_would_like_your/,"Finally calmer after my last post, would like your insights","I finally managed to cool off a bit over the past few days of worrying about the date being called off. Thanks a lot to the commentor who told me to read about foreboding joy, it is a very accurate description of what is happening to me and even just knowing that brought some relief to me. Might talk about this at therapy once I get my session fixed.

Still no confirmation on when the date could happen as she says she is out of town (albeit no that far) until her exams end (she is in uni). I'm taking her word for it, have no reason to doubt it. Not bugging her about it as it just sounds wrong to me at this point.

In hindsight, it did not really feel like my week. A lot of things I was looking forward to got called off this week on short notice or fell short of expectations.

I tried putting my mind off which thankfully worked out better today. Found a great guitar store nearby for having my instrument serviced and it was exciting bwing there Checking out the guitars that caught my eye, hitting it off with the store owner (not many experienced guitarists in my area), helped a kid select a guitar for himself and ended up jamming with a few folks who were testing out their instruments post repairs. I also got invited to a house party that I look forward to, having friends I do like hanging out with also being invited there.

I also thought about what has been bothering me this time and I finally got the following -

As of now, this seems to be the highest amount of emotional investment I have made in the process of asking someone out that I like. I have found myself to really like her and have not stopped myself from feeling whatever emotions I had this time.This also probably means it will hurt that much more if things do not work out which is something I'm afraid of.
  

She did say yes to a coffee date but the time did not get confirmed. This has been bothering me as well based on experiences I have observed. The first time I got a yes was months ago (the post exists) and a month later, it was called off by her (too young for her). Something similar happened to a friend who also got a yes but she never followed up with him.

Not entirely new things. I get that I will have to risk getting hurt if I want to find a partner I really like being with.

I am not making conclusions on what is going to happen as of now. However, at the same time I have no offline dating experience at the same time which is also probably making me nervous about this whole thing. I don't think my Tinder experience is useful here considering how pushy I was getting, forcing the process likely out of desperation (the app made me feel expendable).

Which is why I was hoping to learn from the experiences of people here who have dated offline -

Have you ever had someone say yes to you asking then out but not finalise when and where you could meet?

Did the date finally happen?

If yes, how long did it take to finalise the time and place after you asked the person out?

1fxqlys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightmares/comments/1fxqlys/my_rosey_nightmare/,My Rosey Nightmare,"Names altered for privacy.

This morning, I jolted awake from a nightmare. I'm typically a heavy sleeper and don't dream often, when I do, I typically am not able to recall my dreams. This one, I typically don't recall after rejoining the overworld. But this morning is different. This morning, I recall. I recall having this nightmare often. These nightmares started when I got away from Rosey. It’s as if my dream world and reality swapped places. The once peaceful refuge of sleep has become my Rosey nightmare.

In the years leading up to my escape, Rosey used to have a boundary she wouldn't cross with my sleep. It was my refuge. My place to go when I could no longer bare the relentless accusations and berating. Where I'd no longer have to fear getting hit, stabbed, or kicked. One of my few escapes that didn't include running and trying to get past Rosey barricading my escape. The escape I needn't fear of being chased after. Over the last year or so that changed. She started waking me from my sleep. Shed shove, elbow, hit, and even kick to wake me up. Sometimes it was because she randomly made food in the wee hours of the night and wanted to serve me, towards the end it was more often to accuse and berate me. Sleep, once my haven, become my hell.

In my nightmare, I'm on an Island. The journey to escape involves navigating through two islands. The first is a chaotic, dimly lit indoor space, resembling a cluttered thrift store with narrow, debris-filled pathways. There is only one escape route, a path I’ve run countless times. Yet, each time feels like the first for Rosey as she chases me. A discrete, dark hole in the ground off to the side of the path leads to the second island.

The second island is rugged wilderness with steep, jagged coniferous mountain terrain and large trees I'm able to hide behind. I start off at the center with my escape route leading to a small fishing boat on the shore. It's the only boat around. Once I've made it to this island my escape is more likely as I make my way down to the boat, hassle with it as quicky as I can to get it started, and riding off into the night as the island fades into the distance under the moonlight.

Getting away however, isn't easy. I'm a 5'8"" 230lb man and she's slender 5'4"" 120lb woman with an inhuman ferocity. I'm disabled with bilateral sciatica. My legs can't move fast enough. I'm only able to run faster than her in short bursts. To get away I have to wait until she's distracted; but she's vigilant. She anticipates my attempt to escape. I'm lucky if I get more than a 30 second lead. She can run faster than me for longer than me. The best escapes are when I have enough of a lead to make a sudden turn out of sight, find a decent hiding place, wait for her to pass and then give up finding me, or when she has an ailment that inhibits her keeping up with me.

I'm a big guy, why not fight? Can't do that, not an option. I don't fight unless I fear death is imminent. Men aren't allowed to fight women, and death being imminent is hardly excused. If I was to fight, I'd be up against a behemoth packaged in a 5'4"" 120lb body with insane strength and tenacity. She once threw a heavy wooden coffee table at me from across the room and hit me at chest height. When she was arrested a couple years ago it took everything 5-6 burly policemen had to get her into the police car despite her being handcuffed behind the back. One would think it was crackhead strength, although the only substance she'd use was concentrate THC.

Last night was one of those nights I couldn't make it away from Rosey. I'd found a hiding spot under furniture. At first she  passed me by, then circled back when she realized I had disappeared. I thought, ""Yes! she's given up"" as she walked away. But I couldn’t just get up and run. I had to be sure she was really gone, far enough away that she wouldn’t see me when I emerged. The only way to be sure was to wait.

But last night, she wasn't gone. She came back and found me. I didn't want to look at her and confirm my fear, but I could feel her presence, her heavy gaze as she walked by. She had found me. Escape was impossible now; she knew I was trying to get away and wouldn’t let herself be distracted.

Yet, I did get away. For the first time, I escaped Rosey by waking up. For the first time, I can recall this recurring nightmare after waking. Sleep is no longer my refuge. But now, I wake up in the security of my family home, surrounded by the support of my siblings. I’m safe, at least until I sleep again tonight.",1,1728247994.0,Nightmares,0,1.0,False

Before I was with my  ex, they told me that they had a grandson (6'3, blond hair, blue eyes) my age and that I should meet him, but they left it alone after I started dating someone else.

 I hadn't met their grandson until June. I was home from my out of town job for the week and they were really surprised to see me back at church. I guess no one told them I would be back for a bit. It turns out their grandson was staying with them that weekend and would be at church.

I was on a low dose (10mg, but I’m a very petite woman) of Citalopram from 2019-2024. I’d been on it twice previously, in high school and then again in 2016-2017(?) with minimal side effects (hence why I’ve only tried one SSRI!). I tapered off with doctor permission in July of this year. Had some pretty annoying brain zaps for a while, but they subsided. Lately I’ve just felt sort of mentally scrambled, if that makes sense. Nothing too alarming, but it’s like I feel restless and tired at the same time. I’ve struggled with organization and memory my entire life, have had an ADD diagnosis since 2002, etc, but it’s felt worse lately. Almost as if I’m extremely low-level anxious, can’t seem to get tasks in order, have restless energy but am also tired at the same time, zoning out (though I do just tend to do that), sometimes have mild racing thoughts. None of this has impaired my daily functioning, but I’ve noticed it and it’s a little weird. Could this be related to my brain adjusting to not getting the serotonin “boost” it’s had for years, or I overthinking it? 

Edit for clarification: celexa worked for me, but I’d been on the same dose for so long and was doing better mentally and was curious about stopping again. My reason for meds has always been more of a “this helps me cope better when things are upsetting” reasoning than a “I am in danger without SSRIs” reasoning. I don’t do any recreational drugs aside from normal coffee intake and a social drink on the weekends. ",2,1728247762.0,SSRIs,0,1.0,False

Tengo un problema y no se soy la mala en esto, recupitulemos desde el principio, conocí a mi grupo de amigos en el 2018, nos llevábamos bien, si hubo discucones, donde nos separabamos y a veces quedaba al medio de las disscuciones pero siempre nos volviamos a juntar, siempre supe que mis amigo no eran los mas estudiosos o dedicadsos a los estudios como yo, pero pasaban la materias y yo los ayudaba con estudiar y con los trabajos.

Pasemos a cuando faltaba un año para que fueramos a la universidad, yo estaba siempre estudiando, intentando tener buenas notas para coonceguir una beca y todo, y nunca tenia tiempo para salir, hasta termine con mi última pareja por lo mismo, ya que como dije, no tenia tiempo y siempre se enojaban conmigo por que no salia con ellos, no iba a fiestas y demas pero les decía que para la proxima saldria con ellos (cuando era mas pequeña tampoco salia, no era porque no me gustaba, solo que no tenia amigos y salir a fiestas y esse tipo de cosas  era nuevo para mi), en esos momentos yo igual me enojaba con ellos, no les voy  mentir, pero era por que a cada rato querían salir a fiestas. 

Por un tiempo me distancie, y cuando yo me mude para ir a la universidad perdí un poco el contacto , cuando me matricule, la mayoría de mi grupo lo hizo , pero después de unas semanas, se dieron de baja y se tomaron el año sabático, yo n me preocupe mucho y que no era mi carrera, pero Ies preguntaba si hiban a seguir el proximo año y less ayudaba a buscar una mejor opción de carrera, cuando no podia salir, les avisaba, pero como no agarraba mi teléfono, no leía lo que me mandaban y se enojaban diciendo que las estaba ignorando, yo les decía que no, que estaba ocupada, pero siempre tenían que tener la última palabra, yo las bloqueaba por que sabia que si decias algo mas, la discusión se volvería aun ma grande, a Io que preferí no decir nada mas, no era mi culpa que tuvieran mas tiempo libre que yo.

En otra ocasión, las invite a un viaje, para dar apoyo en un campeonato, no tenían que pagar nada, solo era llevar algo de comida y ya,  pero no quisieron ir por que lo encontraban aburrido, yo igual me enoje, ya que si no hay alcoho, no van, pero lo deje de lado.

Ahora mismo tuvimos un pequeño pleito por lo mismo, donde uno de ellos planeaba una fiesta para halloween y le había dicho que no celebraría ese año, por lo que me contesto que no era sorpresa ya que aa mi no me gusta nada, si me enoje, pero no le dije nada, yo tengo cosa que hacer, tengo que estudiar es mi carrera, si ellos no quisieron seguir, no es mi problem pero tiene que entenderme y no sacarme en caa que nada me gusta y todo el grupo esta de cuerdo.

In a world dominated by sleek, modern designs, there’s a distinct charm in turning back time with rustic and vintage home décor. The inviting warmth of worn wood, weathered metals, and cherished antiques evokes a sense of history, giving any space a cozy, lived-in feel. If you’re looking to infuse your home with character and nostalgia, rustic and vintage styles offer the perfect blend of warmth and authenticity to transform your living spaces.

**The Timeless Charm of Rustic and Vintage Décor**

Combining the rugged appeal of rustic materials with the nostalgia of vintage pieces creates a unique and timeless atmosphere. Rustic décor emphasizes natural materials like wood, stone, and metal, celebrating imperfections with distressed finishes and earthy tones that evoke a sense of connection to the outdoors.

On the other hand, vintage décor celebrates repurposing items from the past, whether it's an antique chest, a set of iron lanterns, or vintage picture frames. The beauty of vintage décor lies in its individuality and craftsmanship, offering one-of-a-kind pieces that stand out from mass-produced items. Together, these styles create a harmonious balance, with every item telling a story.

**Incorporating Rustic and Vintage Décor**

1. **Embrace Natural Materials** Rustic décor relies heavily on natural elements. Start by incorporating reclaimed wood — think barn wood shelves, weathered farmhouse tables, or exposed ceiling beams. Add natural stone accents, like a fireplace, to bring warmth and texture to your space. Vintage pieces, such as old doors repurposed as headboards or antique windows as wall art, also bring a unique touch.
2. **Layer Textures for Depth** The key to rustic and vintage décor is texture. Pair the roughness of wood and stone with soft textiles like cotton, wool, or linen. Vintage quilts, embroidered pillows, and throw blankets add layers of warmth. Mixing textures — a wooden coffee table with a plush sofa or vintage rugs with hard floors — creates a cozy, inviting atmosphere.
3. **Incorporate Handmade Elements** Handcrafted items are essential for adding a personal touch. Whether it's locally made pottery or hand-carved wood pieces, incorporating handmade décor adds authenticity to your space. DIY projects, like refurbishing old furniture, are also a great way to embrace the rustic and vintage style while adding your own twist.
4. **Create a Cozy Atmosphere** Rustic and vintage décor is all about creating a welcoming, lived-in space. Choose warm lighting options like Edison bulbs or vintage-style lanterns, and add candles for ambiance. Prioritize comfort with soft seating, overstuffed cushions, and layered blankets to invite relaxation.

**Why Choose Rustic and Vintage Home Décor?**

Rustic and vintage décor has a timeless appeal because it creates a space that feels warm, inviting, and full of character. Every piece has a story, from a repurposed barn door to an antique side table, and these elements add a unique charm that reflects your personal style.

For those in Phoenix, Maryland, the region’s rich history and abundance of antique shops make it easy to find pieces that fit this aesthetic. When you choose rustic and vintage décor, you’re not just decorating — you’re curating a space that’s full of warmth and nostalgia.

1fxqh9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenendezBrothers/comments/1fxqh9q/devils_advocate_i_still_dont_buy_it/,"Devils Advocate, I Still Don't Buy It","I'm very conflicted with this. I actually was around in 1989 and remember this case very well and followed it. IF they are telling the truth and Jose was a sick disgusting monster, they should be shown leniency, and Jose deserved what he got. I have no sympathy for any child predator. It seems Kitty was a troubled woman who was totally subservient to Jose and distant from Lyle and Erik. If Jose abused them, and she did or said nothing, she was complicent. Perhaps she was emotionally abusive too, we'll never know. 

That being said, hear me out, on the other hand, I am still not totally convinced of the sexual abuse claims of Lyle and Erik. Sure they gave quite the emotional testimonies, but that could be just a delayed regret/reliving the horror of what they did and it hitting them what they now faced. I think there's no disputing that assuming he was not a sexual predator, Jose was not a particularly nice guy regardless, and certainly a tough father with perhaps unrealistic expectations for his sons. 
But there's a big difference between a tough distant hard father than a sexual predator intent on murder. I just don't buy it. He afforded them a rich lifestyle which they loved, and then wanted more, and more independence. They wanted his wealth and resented him for his intolerance of their screw ups and making them think they would be cut off. I think Lyle got wind of this and told Erik and broke it down for him that hey if they cut us off we'll have nothing and have to work for ourselves like other Joe's and we're better than that. In short Lyle was entitled af and convinced Erik who was very emotionally unbalanced that the way out was to do away with their parents. I think Kitty was just a subservient, distant person in the way they had to get rid of along with their main target Jose for a clean slate and live out Lyle's fantasy of being independent wealthy and having all the swagger and drip that came with it.

Remember before the murders, Lyle and Erik weren't model citizens, they had broken into houses in the area stealing expensive things and Jose had to bail them out or keep it hush hush to avoid embarrassment. Some will say they were just acting out because of abuse but plenty of people have been horribly abused and don't do that. My gut just says no. And despite everything, the threat to cut them off financially, not intending to murder them, on the coffee table in the living room, were pieces of (I think Lyle's college application papers) that Kitty had been partially filling out for him. So she did care on some level. And why did they run off and immediately go on spending sprees and act like nothing was wrong? If i had been sexually abused, and i killed my parents, i would not be thinking of running off and going on an expensive shopping spree. Bottom line and crucify me if you will, but just stating what I feel in my gut, Jose and Kitty did not intend to kill them, but cut them off due to their bad behavior, and to them at least to Lyle, this amounted to killing them. An all or nothing black and white mindset. Also, why not give Lyle and Erik polygraphs and ask them point blank were you sexually abused by Jose before his murder? Did you kill him because you feared for your life, or because you wanted his money? Just a simple lie detector test? If they have nothing to hide and are sincere, they should jump at it, no bullshit.

Sorry if this is not the right place to post, please delete if not allowed.

We have a lovely lady who lives in our local
Community who has been an amazing friend to many people in the area, as well as an unpaid carer for numerous elderly residents. 

Without going into too much personal detail, she has had an extremely tough few years. She split from her long term partner due to DV and as a result has been left homeless. To add to this, her only son tragically passed away in a car accident a couple of months ago, and her ever faithful dog was put to sleep last week.

This lady is a saint amongst us, but sadly, due to red tape and our local authority being useless, she has been forced to live in her car for the past four months. She is not a priority, and because she has a job, she’s been told that she is pretty much on her own and needs to work it out for herself. 

As a community, we are desperate to help her and return some of the love she’s shown to many in the area. So we are looking for ways in which we can try and raise some cash for her to help her get back on her feet and into a house before winter hits, and maybe even help pay for a headstone for her son. 
So far we’ve done a coffee and cake morning and a charity raffle, but have only raised around £100. And honestly, we’re out of ideas, so has anyone got any suggestions on fundraising ideas?

1fxqcyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1fxqcyl/the_kudos_email_has_become_my_daily_morning/,The Kudos Email has Become My Daily Morning Affirmation,"So, I'm not a morning person.  I typically spend every morning groggily stumbling around my house grumbling at the existence of the universe as I snag some coffee and get moving for the day.  My normal initial wake-up is at 7, which means I'm typically stumbling out of the shower at around 8 or 8:30 (sometimes earlier, depending on my schedule that day).

But, there's something else that routinely happens between 8 and 8:30 every morning when I'm in the middle of hating reality.  I get an email from AO3 titled ""You've got kudos!""  I often don't even read the email, but I have my phone set up to buzz my watch with any emails I get so regardless of where I'm at in my routine, my wrist vibrates and I see a tiny message on my watch.  Just enough to be a reminder that however much I hate being awake in that moment, in the last 24 hours someone new has read something I wrote and enjoyed it.  Out there somewhere is some stranger who is happy that I'm over here doing what I do.

So, even when I'm not even reading the full email to see *who* is giving me Kudos, that message does a lot to help my mental state.  It's a tiny burst of positivity that hits me just at the right time every morning.  I'm usually groggy enough that I don't notice if I don't get an email that day (it happens sometimes) but I get it frequently enough that I've been able to notice how it helps my overall mental health.

So, if you are ever doubting if giving Kudos matters to an author, it does.  Maybe not a life-and-death difference, but it does bring a smile to my face at a time of day when I'm usually not smiling.",8,1728247345.0,AO3,0,0.9,False

While we were there I found there was one lady that was friendly, made lots of conversation, and seemed to end up helping around us a lot.  She even came over and tied balloons with us until she was getting a blister on her finger from tying so many.

I've never asked anyone out in public before, and definitely not with my daughter there.  But after we got home my daughter asked me why I didn't ask her out.

I've become overly obsessed with spending time with him, even though he has a busy schedule. I often feel upset when he prioritizes anything over me, and while I recognize this is selfish, I don't want to be a toxic partner making him jump through hoops for my happiness.

A bit of backstory: I met Sam almost a year ago through mutual connections. Our initial conversation was supposed to be brief, but we ended up talking for hours. Despite his busy phone, he chose to stay and chat with me. We started texting and calling daily, spending long hours on the phone due to our flexible schedules.

Soon, Sam visited me at work and took me out to dinner, though I didn’t realize it was a date. I was still processing a recent breakup, and he seemed aware that I was emotionally unavailable. Nevertheless, he began insisting on daily meetups, surprising me with flowers and lunch. I often declined his offers but was ultimately convinced to spend time with him. I enjoyed the attention, despite lacking romantic feelings at the time.

Eventually, he ended things due to personal reasons but quickly returned with coffee and cake, which touched me deeply. I realized how much his gestures impacted my life. After losing my job, he spent even more time with me, showering me with surprises and care. While we became physically involved, I still didn’t have romantic feelings.

Over time, I began to develop feelings for Sam, realizing I had a deep comfort with him. I wanted to explore our relationship further. However, he soon informed me that he would be very busy due to a lifestyle change, joking that I might leave him because things would change. Our daily interactions dwindled, and I found myself returning to the loneliness I felt before meeting him. 

I struggled to adjust to this sudden change, even after starting a new full-time job. Although I’ve improved, my mental state has suffered. The intense connection we had lasted 2-3 months, and I know the honeymoon phase is common in relationships. I acknowledge that Sam's initial attention felt like love-bombing, which shifted my expectations. He admits he fell for me quickly, but I wish things had unfolded differently. Initially he would do crazy things for me like showing up at random places to see me or getting me medicine and soup when I was sick. Some days we spent every living second of the day together or even an entire week together. That lasted for some time before this change happened. 

When things initially changed I would come back home every day to feeling empty and I would cry for hours. I would see things that reminded me of him and I would feel deeply sad regardless of having seen him the same week. It felt like I was grieving for 5-6 months. I have gotten past that period now but things are still not sane for me mentally. I am still suffering but the issue is that our relationship is having problems. 

 Here's the actual problem: no matter how much effort Sam puts in, I feel resentful and wish for more. There are a couple of factors at play:

We face constant interruptions when we're together because he's busy with multiple businesses and family obligations. His phone rings non-stop.
He doesn’t make plans. We only see each other when he feels the need to meet my expectations, rather than him initiating time together. I would like it if he was just like ""hey i would love to see you at this time __"" but for some reason it feels like he does it out of pure obligation. A few weeks ago, he took a spontaneous trip with his friend group, which made me a bit jealous. When I mentioned it, he said he was pressured into going because they had already made plans. He seems to need external pressure to take breaks, as he’s a workaholic. He hinted that if I need some time with him I just have to ask and he will make it happen. He has told me this situation won’t last forever, as he has plans to change things once he meets his goals. He often communicates that he is doing all this so he can have a future with no worries like he had growing up and he wants me alongside him. 

He is very supportive emotionally and understands my mental struggle and suggested therapy for me. I often get angry at him and it's not helpful to our dynamic since he works non stop and can't get relief even when he is spending time with me. 

This week we have spent a lot of time together. My reaction would say that we don't see each other for weeks on end. I saw him 3 days in a row but every time he had to leave, I started acting childish. He doesn't express annoyance with my behavior, he shows me love and whatever I express that my needs are. I will soon start therapy but I am wondering what might be causing this with me? Is it just that I am emotionally dependant on him? I start to feel dread for whenever he might have to leave. I get anxious sometimes even when he is there. I feel jealous when he makes time for his family or friends and feel bad about myself but I can't help it. His family is lovely and I don't like the way I have started feeling towards them. He is really close to his family and he is a caring person in general.

Hopefully, when we're together, my albums will also be filled by wonderful photos of our adventures around the world (Europe first, then somewhere else).

I do prefer someone also from here in London. So I can be with you regularly and we can spend quality time. I'm not sure if I can do long distance again since I have trust issues coming from the past. But let's see if it'll work.

I'm just a simple guy, not very hard to please. If you've reached this part and you're game with everything, maybe you can send me a message and let's see where it goes?

Just in case you're wondering, I prefer a top, masc guy. Oh and sorry if I do not prefer South Asians. I had a pretty traumatic experience years back. 🙈

Will wait for you, my Nick!

1fxq14f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesome/comments/1fxq14f/kindness_for_homeless_man_becomes_contagious/,Kindness for homeless man becomes contagious :))),"I truly doubted about posting this cause it could be seen as bragging... but Ive seen the butterfly effect its had, and I know I was inspired by other stories of acts of kindness. So, feeling very shy, here I go :) 

Last Tuesday I was walking around my block and I saw a sign taped to a wall: ""Dont leave stuff here, next time we will call the police"". It was in a place thats a bit protected from the elements and sometimes homeless people sleep there. 

I was so angry. What was wrong with people? It was in a part of the building that doesnt have car access, barely anyone passes, no doors close, I could not think of a reason anyone could care if someone slept there. The homeless people weve had in our neighbourhood never have caused any trouble, some have stayed for months and are quiet, respectful and *just want to be able to be in peace*, dammit. 

I mulled over it all day long. I told some neighbours, they got pissed too. I said I was going to put another sign, answering back. My neighbours (Juan) girlfriend (Marta) said, we should bring them something to eat! I thought it was a great idea! I couldnt at that moment, but we would do it in the evening. 

I am part of an urban vegetable garden, so I went to see if there was any fruits or veggies I could pick up from the common areas. I found my friend Graciela there, told her the story, she sympatized a lot and helped me gather fruits, small branches of grapes that were still left on the vines from the past harvest. I thanked her so much, I wouldnt have found so much without her help. 

Juan and Marta couldnt go in the end, so I went alone to where the sign was. I found 3 people close and I politely asked if theh knew what the sign was all about. One of them said it was cause of him... he had left some clothes there. He kept em in some bushes now. I must have gotten an angry face cause he said it was okay, he didnt mind keeping em in the bushes. 

I told em some neighbours were vwry mad at the situation, and showed him two signs:
- One, for the wall: ""Is it really that difficult to have compassion for someone who doesnt have a refuge? If theyre not creating trouble, littering, or leaving around objects that could hurt pets or children, what is the problem? If it hurts your sighr so much, give them a curtain.""
""To whoever put this sign: I hope karma never leaves you in a situation when you have to carry your sleeping bag all day with you for fear of it being stolen. To whoever felt mensced by this sign: not all of us neighbours hate you. You are people and deserve to be treated as such:. 

- A second one, in the bag with food I brought: ""A loving reminder that not all neighbours despise you. Im not the only one that despised that sign. At least as far as Im concerned, and no matter how long or short of a period you stay here, as long as were all civic, respectful and safe, WE ARE NEIGHBOURS. These are some fresh fruits, picked this afternoon, i Hope you enjoy them"".

The man, and his friends (kids that lived in the block and apparently had known this person for years with no problem) were so touched. He took the note and put it with so much care inside his backpack. We hugged, then I remembered (duh) to ask for his name! And I realized I had seen him before! His name is Emilio. I gave him a bit bottle of cold water last August. Hes very nice and polite. 

He told me some neighbours had been throwing trash at him from the upper windows, even water... trying to make him leave. My blood boiled. He was actually very understanding. Apparently, a year ago someone else had put a bunch of clothes where he was sleeping, put gasoline on them and set em on fire. He understood people could have gotten scared... he was taking it all with so much grace and understanding, I dont think I would have been capable. Apparently the person who put the original sign came to talk to him, apologized and gave him a coffee. But didnt take the sign off. And also, people were *throwing stuff at him*. I hanged my sign right next to the other one.

The wonderful thing... is that the next day Graciela, my vegetable garden friend, called me. Told me she had been so sad about that sign, she had cooked several meals for this man, but she was in a rush, could I go pick em up and give them to him? OF COURSE!!!! There was actually so much that I gave him half and kept the other half in my fridge to give him some days later 😅

But my neighbours Juan and Marta still are going to bring him something to eat, they bought some melons. And yesterday I told the story to my dad... and when I mentioned Emilio putting so lovingly the note I gave him in his half-broken backpack, he stood up saying he was sure he had some backpacks somewhere he wasnt using and it could help!

And... one sign brought another. My idea of the sign brought Martas idea of food, which I borrowed. Then Graciela upped that two orders of magnitude xD then my dad got invested too. 

And all of us could have looked at the sign and said nothing, or heard the story and do nothing... but this week, Emilio woke up to a menacing sign- and by the end of it, he has received fruits, toilet paper, a water bottle, some plastic, easy to transport cutlery, food for a whole week (Jesus, Graciela xD) and when I go to see him again hell receive 2 new backpacks and a suitcase (my dad insists I give him all options to choose, or for him to keep all). 

And... it kinda makes my heart sing! ^^ Years ago I wouldnt have had any idea what to do. Ive seen so many videos of people just, extending kindness, that the idea of letting know (whoever it was, I didnt know I knew the man already) that they were respected came to my mind. I know seeing that kind of content inspired me, and started a chain of events.

So I really dont want this to be ablut me- its about Emilio. It could beabout Graciela cause, damn, I only wanted to have a small detail with whoever it was, but she must have cooked for hours (spent time, ingredients, containers), and even asked me where he was in case another day she brought more xD 


But mostly, I wanna share in case this inspires someone, like other content inspired me in the past 🥰",10,1728246482.0,wholesome,1,0.92,False

Holy fuck was it boring. I've heard so much about it over the years, mainly from our old friends from VA who have been going for years. After being invited for the better part of two decades, we finally caved and bought tickets. Wife and I took our 11 year old daughter who was not amused. 

She did enjoy the jousting but she rides so never complains about watching horses do things. After that, it was just sorta wandering, milling about and eating bad food. We got there around 1130 and I'm already back in north harford county halfway through a cup of coffee. Couldn't wait to leave. Anyways, renfest, I wouldn't recommend it.

My first step towards going less upf is obviously this because I have insane amounts of it. But I really like it so Im trying to compromise by getting unflavoured protein powder and flavoring it myself but tbh I dont even know if its possible. 

Tried plain cocoa powder for the chocolate and peanut butter combos but im at a loss with other random flavors. Are they ALWAYS upf? No way to make it at home?",1,1728246302.0,ultraprocessedfood,7,0.67,False
1fxpxad,https://i.redd.it/b4hl0xi937td1.jpeg,Do's and Don'ts on the pitch ,"Hey disc golf folks! What kind of ethical rules do you go by on the disc golf pitch? Mine are:

+ Greet eachother when you come across a fellow disc golfer.

+ Let people pass you if they are faster/ better or fewer. 

+ Analyze the pitch when you walk towards it or when your friend is throwing. Don't start to think about the choice of disc when its your turn .

+ Put in the score while you walk towards the next hole, don't stop at the basket.

+ I love having a chat out in the nature with me fellows while playing. Throw first, then talk though. Disc golf is more walking and waiting than actually throwing and while you walk you can talk as much as you want to. 

- Do not wait ON THE TEE and stress them when they are playing.

- Do not throw until the other players are finished (even if the players are far away, you will not gain any time by doing that, you just have to wait for even longer in the next hole). 

+ When waiting for someone, talk to eachother, rest for a bit, grab a cup of coffee or have a snack instead of staring and feel frustrated that more people than you play disc golf.

I am the only full time worker there, other three are students and mostly never come during college semesters so I'm usually left alone.

I was working in the kitchen before for almost 2 years and couldn't really put up with the stress that comes with it so i went bartendering since i don't have trade school or anything else to do (haven't went to college). 

I can make coffee and cocktails, since I bartended through out high school. 

But this is too much, I do work of 3 or 4 people and do alot of overtimes when closing the place since i didn't manage to clean anything. probably 55 to 60 hour work weeks, sometimes working for more than 7 days straight. I literally cant fall asleep, I eat alot less, stoped keeping up with my hygene and started drinking and smoking again so I can be somewhat numb to the stress in and outside of work.

But i don't really have much of a choice to do something else, so can you give me advice on how to keep up, and not get sick due to high stress?

1fxpvkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1fxpvkz/wine_pairing_help_for_my_upcoming_menu/,Wine Pairing Help for My Upcoming Menu!,"Hey all,

I'm hosting a dinner soon, and I’d love to get your thoughts on the wine pairings I’ve chosen, especially since I’m fairly new to this. My budget is around €10-€15 average per bottle, and I love adding a bit of surprise to the experience! Also, I really like a proper build up.

Amuse Bouche:
I’m serving a few small amuses and pairing them with a sparkling wine as a palate cleanser. I’m not too worried about this one, as any decent bubbly should do the trick (so no advice needed).

First Cold Starter (Mosaic of Salmon and Cod):  
This dish features raw salmon and cod with a vinaigrette of coconut and fish sauce, passionfruit gel, avocado puree, and kaffir lime oil. My current choice is a Verdejo from Rueda. I’ve found a really nice one and I think it’ll go very well with this rather light dish.

Second Cold Starter (Tzatziki 2.0):
This version has chunks of cucumber, a garlic cream, and a cucumber-dill gel. I’m leaning toward a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, but I’m not sure. It might be a bit too fruity. However, it should have more body then the Verdejo (or I should swap the starters). Also thinking about a crisp but creamy Chardonnay, but not sure where to find such. So I would really love some suggestions.

Duck Confit/Rillettes with Cherry, Peach, and Apple Purees:
I’m thinking of a Pinot Noir, ideally from France, but considering my budget, I might end up with something from a similar climate elsewhere. I think it could match the richness of the duck and the fruitiness of the fruit. A white can also be an option here I guess, but that shouldn’t conflict the wine of the previous dish.

Warm Course (Lamb Shoulder Ravioli):
This is an Italian-style dish with soffritto, tomatoes, herbs, and pecorino foam. I’m leaning towards a Chianti or another Sangiovese from Italy, as I think the acidity will cut through the richness of the lamb and cheese.

Main Course (Entrecôte & Slow-Cooked Beef in Red Wine Sauce):
Served with a potato pave, chive emulsion, mushroom puree, braised leeks, oyster mushrooms, mustard seeds, and a red wine sauce. I’m thinking a Cabernet Sauvignon from Moldova might be an unexpected but solid pairing for the deep, earthy flavors. Thoughts?

Cheese Course (Served with Beer):
I’ve already got this one covered, as I’m going with beer pairings instead of wine for the cheeses. I personally find beer to be a better all-rounder with a variety of cheeses.

Dessert (Tiramisu 2.0):
A mille-feuille version with a coffee-flavored pastry and mascarpone, egg, chocolate, and vanilla cream. Since traditional tiramisu usually features marsala, I’m thinking of serving a glass of Marsala alongside this.

I’m really curious to hear if I’m on the right track with these pairings or if there are any other wines you’d suggest. I’ve been doing my own research, but I’d love to tap into the expertise of this community!

1fxpslo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1fxpslo/what_to_do/,what to do?,"A close friend of mine owes me money since may/june this year. I really trusted him that he’d pay me back because he had promised and had multiple chances to do so. Calls me the other day to tell me he bought a $900 gift for his ex. EX!!! The ex that left him and bragged about using him the whole time? Oh my God. 


Anyway, we were both supposed to be in town so he asked me to help him and run an errand. It was urgent. So again I helped him out and were going to meet up for coffee afterwards. I waited on him for 6 hours(with our buddy too) to hang out. The dude finally comes, sits down, sips his coffee and asks all of buddies if anyone’s going to eat with him some place else. He got angry that I wasn’t going anywhere and told him that I’ve waited on him the whole day. I wasn’t going to leave. He just picked up and left, didn’t even say bye. 


I’m so angry I’m not picking up his phone calls for now. Any way to navigate this or just cut him off completely? I believe his ex brainwashed him and changed him forever.",1,1728245863.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1fxppf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1fxppf6/it_gets_better_1_year_on_400_mg/,It Gets Better - 1 Year On 400 mg,"I see a lot of posts on this sub about the early side effects for Qelbree and I wanted to share my experience of what it has been like to push through and continue on the medication. 

For reference I am a 40 y.o. female who was diagnosed last year with fairly severe combined type ADHD. I pursued diagnosis and treatment because I work in a demanding, high pressure corporate job and between those responsibilities + kids and pets at home, I was struggling to keep up. My ADHD symptoms caused significant forgetfulness, high anxiety, non-stop obsessive thought spirals and the constant stress of feeling like I had ""too many tabs open"" while trying to remember all of the things I needed to accomplish at the same time. 

My side effects from Qelbree were very bad at first. I experienced intense insomnia, headaches, nausea, dizziness and dry mouth. I thought about quitting the medication out of desperation after about 4 weeks, but decided to tough it out because I felt like it was the only way to maintain my career/livelihood. After 2-3 months, the symptoms almost entirely went away and I just felt ""normal"" and able to calmly think about one thing at a time for the first time in my adult life. I also almost eliminated my anxiety and depression, which I did not realize were connected to the ADHD. I lost 30 pounds due to a reduction in ""food noise,"" similar to what ozempic patients describe and I stopped stress eating.

After a year, here are the pros and cons.


Pros:

1. Improved performance at work
2. Reduced depression and anxiety
3. Lost 30 pounds
4. Able to accomplish more routine tasks without overwhelm
5. Reduced procrastination
6. Increased ability to focus and concentrate


Cons:

1. Dry mouth is still present and my mouth almost glues shut if I talk too much without drinking water (makes leading a meeting difficult)   
2. Lower libido 😕
3. Weirdly I don't like coffee anymore? It's a small thing, but I used to love coffee so much
4. Reduced interest in hobbies and creativity generally
5. Overall efficacy of the qelbree has diminished over time but I don't want to increase the dosage

Overall I think it's worth it and the side effects have been a low price to pay when my ADHD was making my life very difficult. I miss certain parts of myself that I lost and I think I would stop taking the drug if I didn't have so many responsibilities, but it hasn't changed me ENOUGH to say it wasn't worth it. This was truly a matter of survival. 

Happy to answer any questions if you have them!

1fxpn2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/houseplants/comments/1fxpn2h/red_ring_on_dwarf_umbrella_leaf/,"red ""ring"" on dwarf umbrella leaf?","Hello,

Has anyone seen these ""red rings"" on their houseplants before? What are these?

For some background information: I bought this dwarf umbrella from wholefoods about two weeks ago, and since I got it home I haven't watered it or changed the pot/soil yet because the water was quite well watered at the store. I did get rid of some old leaves with little red spots on them but I was not sure if they were infections. I also sprayed neem oil **multiple times** on and under the leaves (I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing...). So far I'm only seeing these weird red rings on the new growths (only since the plant got to my home). I also bought back a coffee plant which is doing fine and they are now placed side by side (not touching each other though).

Should I quarantine the plant and replace the soil? How should I treat these leaves? Any information is very appreciated! Thank you!
