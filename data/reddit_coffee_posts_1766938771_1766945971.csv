Hi! I’m doing my Masters + PhD :) I was raised in both the US and UK over the years so my accent throws people off (I just embrace it as an international school accent). I did my undergrad overseas and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house. 

I don’t even know what to say, if you’re kind, can keep the conversation going we can take this somewhere far. I’m certain. I can show you my stupid yarn collection or something and make you a stupid mushroom pizza toast with Japanese milk bread every Sunday morning. I’ll play overcooked with you and we can tell other where we are lacking and laugh, oh we can laugh together. 

Let’s laugh together? I also want to travel in trains, I fucking love stupid trains fucking choo choo. ",1,1766945763.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

# Beyond the Blend: Discovering Single Origin Coffee

Tired of your daily coffee tasting… well, just like coffee? Single origin coffee offers a journey for your palate, moving beyond generic flavor profiles to reveal the unique character of beans from a specific region, farm, or even a single estate.

Unlike blends, which combine beans from multiple sources to achieve a consistent taste, single origin coffees highlight the terroir – the soil, climate, and altitude – that shape their flavor. This means a coffee from Ethiopia might burst with floral and fruity notes, while one from Sumatra could offer earthy, chocolatey depth. Each cup tells a story of its origin.

*   **Traceability:** Know exactly where your coffee comes from, often down to the specific farm or cooperative.
*   **Unique Flavors:** Experience a diverse spectrum of tastes and aromas you won't find in blended coffees.
*   **Supporting Farmers:** Often, buying single origin directly supports the farmers and their communities.

1pxy3ew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxy3ew,Has it progressed to periodontal disease? Do I have gum recession?,"Back in October I visited the dentist after not having a check up for a few years, I felt the need to go after an emergency tooth extraction at a dentist I was not registered to led to symptoms of gum disease or maybe made it worse. But ever since I had a tooth infection and that tooth removed my teeth and gums seem to be progressively getting worse:(

My new dentist I visited in October, recommended a few fillings and a hygienist appointment. At the hygienist apt I was informed I had mild gum disease and to floss twice a day, use an electric toothbrush and interdental brushes. They then booked me in for an appointment in 3 months and said if it has improved then I would need to visit every 6 months, which led me to believe that this was at the gingivitis stage so I could cure it.

The hygienist definitely installed the fear and I have been consistent ever since, I also included a water flosser but the last week have decided to stop because my gums seem to not be responding to the routine.

I also chew Xylitol gum or use the mints after each meal, and ensure I drink water after every meal or every time I have any more acidic drinks. I’ve reduced my coffee intake, and limited as many sweet treats as I can (I naturally have a sweet tooth and hormones sometimes make it hard to resist). I’ve increased veggies and proteins in my diet. I also use a daily vit d+k2 spray and calcium supplements. I must admit I am not great at managing stress (my job has been very stressful lately) but I am looking at counselling and speaking to work about how they can help.

But despite all this my gums seem to be getting better in waves and worse in waves. I’ll have a few days were I am convinced I’ve cured it and then my gums will again feel sensitive or look puffier. 

I revisited the dentist early this month when I started to question if I was making any progress (it had been 3 weeks since the hygienist apt). I said my gums looked puffier, they also appeared to be pulling away from the sides of my teeth when I flossed. She said this was normal after a hygienist appointment and they looked like they were starting to heal (she only checked by looking at them for like 20 seconds). 

She kinda insinuated that I was being a bit dramatic, I do have OCD so I do convince myself that something is worse than it may actually be, but I don’t know I feel like it isn’t normal.

Since then my gums have again sometimes felt like they’ve got better but then got worse the last week. They have been sensitive, appeared more swollen especially the bottom set of my teeth next to the extraction site and they pull away slightly at the sides or it feels like some gaps in my gums are bigger/looser. I also feel like this area of my gums move when I eat, which again didn’t happen until the last 2 weeks.I’m also convinced that my gums are looking like they’re starting to recede (but it’s hard to tell because I don’t have photos from my teeth before all of this). The only thing that makes me feel slightly positive or hopeful is they no longer bleed unless I am accidentally a bit more aggressive with a interdental brush. I have not had a good track record with my teeth and my family has a history of gum disease etc, but I would really like to do my best to keep what I can and change my poor habits.

Is it normal? Am I not giving it enough time to heal? Or has it progressed to periodontal disease? Should I ask for a second opinion from a different dentist at the same surgery? Is there anything more I could be doing to help my gums?

1pxy3cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1pxy3cr/pressure/,Pressure.,"Good day,
I was reading about how you should brew the coffee with a moka pot and as I understood, you put it on a middle fire or heat, depends on the stove. 
But I noticed that when it's high heat, the coffee comes out fast and when it's low heat then it's slow. 
In that case does it mean that when it's flowing fast, the pressure is high and can get more out of the coffee but also burn it? 
and if it's on a low heat with a slow flow, it will not burn it but might not get the flavours out of the coffee? 

Thank you in advance.

I don't know whether this is the right platform to talk about this or not also, this is a bit out of my comfort zone, but I felt like sharing.

I’m 22 (almost 23), and I’ve nvr been in a relationship. During clg, I liked a girl who was also my best friend. When I finally confessed, she told me there was no future between us. I’m not even sure if she liked me back or not. After clg ended, we stopped talking. That was around two years ago, so I’ve made my peace with it and moved on.

Fast forward to now, I’m working in Bengaluru in the corporate world. With the year coming to an end, I’ve been feeling unusually lonely. Most of my close friends aren’t around here, and weekends feel especially empty. Some days, I just wish I had someone to talk to about how my day went, make spontaneous weekend plans, go out for a coffee, attend events, yk, the simple things.

I’m not writing this out of desperation, just honesty. I genuinely enjoy my own company, but sometimes it feels nice to have *s*omeone yk...

So, a brief intro about me (just in case someone knows someone, or this resonates with you):

* **Age:** 22 (turning 23 soon)
* **Location:** Bengaluru
* **Profession:** ECE engineer (corporate)
* **Interests:**
   * Video editing & cinematography
   * Exploring cafes (big foodie 🍽️)
   * Music events & live gigs
   * Stand-up comedy shows

I’m more of a calm, observant person than a loud one, and I value genuine conversations over small talk.

1pxxujs,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1pxxujs/my_review_of_the_jubilee_as_a_first_time_cruiser/,My review of the Jubilee as a first time cruiser.,"Hey guys! I (39m) and my son (12) just got back from our very first cruise ever with the Jubilee and we were on the December 20th-27th cruise.  I figured I would write this for specifically the people that have never done, planning one or about to go on their first one as there was some stuff I did not learn until I actually experienced it myself. Now I cannot stress this enough this was just based off my own experience and others and yours may differ.

1.  The embarkment from Galveston port was an absolute nightmare for us.  There was no clean cut lines and we had no idea where to go.  I spoke to other people and other long-term cruisers who said that this was not typical at all.  From my understanding, there was construction going on by the terminal that caused backups so it just may be a one-time thing. When we finally figured out where to go it took us about an hour to get in the building and start the process.  After we got to the point where they started checking our pass ports it went pretty smooth after that. 

2.  After getting on the ship and finding our way to our room we decided to check out the ship and the sail away party and find food.  People were not kidding on how crowded just that one area of the ship gets, the crowds were huge, buffet and guys burger was packed.  Just be prepared for that.  I have never used the word overstimulated before, but if there was a good time to use that word it was for that first day.  Luckily after the first day it never quite got that crowded and it was more spread out through the ship. 

3. Speaking of the rooms, we were on the 15th deck with an extended balcony.  I will never not do any other room other than a balcony; it was my favorite thing to do on the ship late at night or early morning.  I loved sitting out there watching the water.  Now the room itself was what I expected a little on the small side but I knew that going on.  However, the bathroom on the other hand, yikes.  I am 6'2 damn near 300 lbs. and while sitting on the toilet you can brush your teeth and damn near take a shower all at the same time.  my left knee did touch the sink, but my right knee didn't quite hit the door but it was super close.  There was no room to change in the bathroom at all.  So bigger guys and gals may be mindful of that, although I'm sure my cabin was just a standard room, I am not sure what other rooms offer bigger bathrooms outside of like the suites. 

4. Elegant night.  I did not think much of it, but damn people take that seriously and I have never seen so many dressed up people in my life, I will definitely partake next time I cruise but it was not mandatory.  

5. The food was awesome, no matter where we ate.  We did not get to try everything, but the food we did try was amazing.  My son's favorite was Costal Slice (pizza) and mine had to be street eats.  Street eats are three snack shack type foods located at the Lido deck (16) that changed the menu every day.  Those places were Time Fries, Steam Dream and for the life of me I cannot remember the third one.  Time fries had variations of different fries with different combinations of food like carne asada, pizza sauce and cheese and things of that nature.  Steam dream was different dumplings, and Bao wraps each day, so good.  And then the Indian place was just different curries or bulgogi bowls, just really good.  I may get some hate for this, but Guys Burgers was really good, and I ate it several times, but I don't see the big hype for it, it just tasted like a normal burger, but the toppings were fresh and still really good though and they had by far the longest lines at least that I saw. 

6. Bubbles package.  I am not a drinker at all so opted for me and my son to do the bubbles package (unlimited soda).  We had no clue how to get or where to get the soda till day 2.  So there are two ways, you can find the drink stations or go to random places to get the sodas.  I only found 3 drink stations (fountain drinks) on the ship.  There could be more, but I did not locate them.  Two of them are in the Lido deck located at the buffet and the third one was located on deck 8 at the Pig and Anchor.  Regardless of if you have the package or not it will make you swipe your sail and sign card to activate the machine and you get 20 seconds to fill up your cup.  Someone did complain that after she got her soda, someone used the machine within those 20 seconds and it charged her account, so I guess that is possible.  To get soda cans, I found the Red Frog on the lido deck will give you canned soda, Coastal Slice will have them and Java Blue (Coffee shop) will also have them.  I am assuming all the bars or at least most of the bars will have canned soda but that is mainly where I got mine.  You will have to give them your card, and you will sign the receipt each time.  Also, you are only allowed a soda every ten minutes while on the package, I am assuming you don't have to wait if you are just paying for them straight up.   I also learned that while getting a red bull at Java Blue when I bought it they automatically add 20% gratuity to it.  It was not much but I just did not know that was a thing especially since I was the one that took the redbull from the fridge myself.  Just something different is all. I came to learn that anything you buy at least food wise gratuity is automatically added no matter what it is.  

7.  Texting.  I read that I had to get the app downloaded on my son's phone so we could chat through the Carnival Hubb App.  While on the ship, I paid for the chat service for both of our phones ($5.00 each) and for the life of me I could not figure out how to get him setup.  While dealing with that, and us both being connected to the wifi I learned that we were just able to text each other normally and that continued throughout the week we were there.  I am assuming since we both had iPhone's it utilized the IMessage but I am not sure and also heard that it does not work with android phones in that same way. I did later learn how to add his Folio number in the app so he could log in and we could utilize the chat as a backup.  Like I said it worked great, there were occasional disruptions when we would have to reconnect to the internet, but it was not a big deal. 

8.  Ports.  We stopped in Cozumel, Costa Mayo and Mahagony Bay.  As far as ports go, Mahagony Bay was by far my favorite with Cozumel coming in second and Costa Maya last. Costa Maya was just too small compared to the number of people and while it was not as aggressive as I have heard as far as vendors trying to get you to buy stuff, it was by far the worst one of those three ports for pushy vendors.  Just nothing tops Mahagony Bay, although it rained some, the free beach was awesome, the walk to get to the beach was awesome and it was just overall a great stop. 

9.  The disembarkation was very well done, it went super smooth and by the time they called my group to leave I was out of the terminal in 10 minutes, it went way better than getting on.  

10.  We did not purchase the Wi-Fi plan and I figured it would do us some good to stay away from that, but they do have a TV in the room that has a very few basic channels (Nickelodeon, HGTV, Etc) and they have some free movies you can watch alone with movies you can buy for $10.00.  Some movies were taken off throughout the week and some were added so it changed up some.  I do wish they had an option to login to Netflix or something    just at night especially after the excursions and later at night we were dead beat tired but couldn't sleep so be able to watch out shows would have been nice, but it wasn't a big deal at the end. 

10.  Ice cream.  The free Ice cream was awesome, but man the two ice cream stations located at Shaqs chicken and Guy's burger was by far the busiest.  If you don't mind going to deck 8, the one located at Pig and Anchor was usually the cleanest and didn't have a lot of people around it.  At least from what I saw. 

  
The only real issue I had was that I purchased bingo cards on the last day at sea, rolled them up and stuck them in my back pocket.  I purchased them early and was going to place them in my room like I did before but my son asked me to meet him at the Arcade.  So I went up there and while there, the bingo cards were just swiped out of my pocket.  Didn't feel or see a thing, so as I was leaving, I went to pull them out and they were gone.  Went to Guest services, I met with security, they reviewed the cameras and confirmed a teenager just pickpocketed me lol. It was my own fault, but security took me to see Mercy (Bingo host) and she was super awesome and she replaced my cards for me which was the only thing I was really hoping for. 

  
I cannot think of anything else at the moment, but If you guys have any questions, I can answer anything you might have!  Overall, we had an amazing time, and there was always something for us to do.  I will say that while me and my kid did a lot of stuff together, he was free to roam the ship after the 2nd day once he knew how to get back to the room and made sure to text me every hour.

1pxxsx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveAdvice/comments/1pxxsx0/most_walkable_allinclusive_resorts_for_people_who/,Most walkable all-inclusive resorts (for people who don’t want to hike a marathon to dinner),"# If you’ve ever stayed at a “mega-resort” where it’s 15 minutes + a golf cart just to grab coffee… you know why walkability matters.

For this list, I’m focusing on resorts that are:

* **4+ star rating** overall (major review sites like Tripadvisor/Expedia)
* Generally **praised for food** (or at least consistently “good for an AI”)
* Have **good beach + pools**
* And—most importantly—**compact / easy to get around** (minimal “shuttle culture”)

Below are the best fits, grouped by “type of walkable.”

# 1) Boutique-small walkable (the easiest “everything is right there” vibe)

# Beloved Playa Mujeres (Mexico)

**Why it’s walkable:** It’s a **small boutique resort (\~109 rooms)** and guests regularly mention it’s **easy to get around**—no shuttles needed. 

  
**Food / beach / pools:** Multiple reviews highlight standout dining experiences and a well-kept pool area; property listings also call out pools and beach locale.

  
**Best for:** Couples who want calm + convenience.

# Keyonna Beach (Antigua)

**Why it’s walkable:** It’s an **adults-only boutique** concept—much more “steps from room → beach → dinner” than sprawling. 

  
**Food / beach / pools:** Reviews frequently praise the beach + food + rooms, and many rooms have plunge pools (bonus). 

  
**Best for:** Rustic-luxe, unplugged, beach-first trips.

# Cocobay Resort (Antigua)

**Why it’s walkable:** It’s a couples-leaning, cottage-style property (not a mega-complex). 

  
**Food / beach / pools:** It’s described as steps from **two beaches** with **infinity pools**, and guests note it doesn’t feel crowded. 

  
**Watch-out:** Some rooms are on hills/steps (common in Antigua), so request easier access if mobility is a concern.



# 2) Compact-but-full-service walkable (still lots to do, but laid out efficiently)

# Couples Negril (Jamaica)

**Why it’s walkable:** Frequent traveler commentary calls it the **most compact** of the Couples resorts (a big deal if you’re avoiding long walks). 

  
**Food / beach / pools:** Guests commonly describe the food/service as excellent, with beach + pool features well covered. 

  
**Best for:** Adults who want easy navigation + that classic Negril beach vibe.

# Couples Tower Isle (Jamaica)

**Why it’s walkable:** Not tiny, but it’s a **contained footprint** (and the brand’s layout tends to be easier than the giant DR/Mexico mega-resorts). The property highlights multiple restaurants/bars and pools without being “city-sized.” 

  
**Food:** Dining gets frequent praise in reviews/discussions (good variety; “food…quite good”). 

  
**Best for:** Couples who want classic Jamaica + easy resort flow.

# ATELIER Playa Mujeres (Mexico)

**Why it’s walkable:** It’s not boutique-small, but it’s generally considered **well-designed and easy to navigate** compared to many mega properties (less “where am I?” energy). 

  
**Food / beach / pools:** Food is one of the most consistently praised elements in reviews (often described as “best…at an all-inclusive”), plus strong beach/pool mentions. 

  
**Best for:** Adults who want elevated dining + a resort that feels cohesive.



# 3) “Vertical walkable” (everything stacked close—elevators count!)

# O2 Beach Club & Spa (Barbados)

**Why it’s walkable:** A lot is concentrated within a tighter footprint (buildings + pools + dining), so you’re not trekking across acres. 

  
**Food / pools:** Guests and coverage frequently call out strong food/cocktails and multiple pools (some with swim-up bars).

  
**Watch-out:** Barbados can be breezier; and some stretches of beach may be less calm for swimming depending on conditions.



# Practical “walkability” tips before you book (saves regrets)

1. **Look for a resort map** before committing. If you see “trams” and “shuttles,” it’s probably not your vibe.
2. **Ask where your room category is located.** Some resorts are walkable… until you’re placed in the farthest building.
3. **Read 10 recent reviews max** and search within them for words like: “long walk,” “shuttle,” “golf cart,” “hills,” “stairs.”
4. **If stairs/hills matter:** Antigua/Caribbean cliffside properties can be gorgeous but steep—request “low floor / minimal steps.”",1,1766944838.0,AllInclusiveAdvice,0,1.0,False

I will try to make this story short I am a divorced 50-ish year old female and two weeks before Christmas I developed Sciatica in my left leg.  It's ever happened before and it has been the worst long term pain I ever experienced in my life.  Progressively the pain got worse and by the Tuesday before Christmas I was unable to sit and therefore could not drive. My teenage daughter (only child) drove me to doctor appointments and wherever I needed to go.  My SO (63M-adult children only) took me to one appointment.  We've been together for 11 years, but do not live together (we live about 20 minutes apart).  He left Christmas Eve to celebrate Christmas with his family.  My daughter left on Christmas Day to visit her dad (she can come back to help if I have emergency, she's only 10 minutes away, but will not be back home until after New Years).  I was in excruciating pain for three days and emotional not well at that point.  I was only sleeping about an hour at a time here and there, so the lack of sleep certainly had an impact on my emotions.  My SO was going to leave early to come home if I was not better on Friday.  Friday I rallied and started to feel somewhat better.  Emotionally I was still a bit of wreck, but physically the pain was more tolerable.  So here's my hurt, my SO came home early Saturday afternoon.  He went out last night with his friends and his friend's sons, who were in town for the holiday.  He never came to see me or even ask if I wanted company.  He did say to let him know if I needed anything.  He knew how down I was emotionally.  I even said I had not left the house in three days and I was going a little stir crazy.  I normally work (off with sick time and for the holidays), work out 5x per week (physically cannot do that) and I am very active, but I have not been able to do much of anything and it has taken its toll on me mentally.  Yesterday he offered to have Uber eats send me coffee, but I declined and asked for Uber to deliver him instead.  So now it is Sunday and I am honestly hurt.  Again he say to let him know if I needed anything.  He says I don't do well communicating, but I was clearly down and emotional in our exchanges since he's been gone and even asked to have Uber deliver him, so I am sure my message was pretty clear.  But maybe not.  I would like some honest feedback. ",1,1766944819.0,relationships_advice,2,0.99,False

1pxxqjm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxxqjm,2025 has been a sad year for Bionicle.,"Dale Wilson (voice of Lewa Nuva and Turaga Onewa in Mask of Light) passed away on January 6th this year. He was one of my favourite Bionicle voice actors, and I was really saddened by the news of his death. May he rest in peace.

Lego forced Team Kanohi to shut down development of Masks Of Power, a free Bionicle fangame. The Lego legal team had previously told them it was ok, but they did a complete 180 out of nowhere. And they're likely not making their own Bionicle game to justify doing this. 

Lego shut down Bricklink in 35 countries. Bricklink is the biggest online market for buying discontinued sets, Bionicle included. They're inadvertently making it harder for people around the world to enjoy Bionicle. (This isn't strictly a Bionicle issue though)

In Lego's year end review on Instagram, they mentioned how many comments they got about Bionicle. But the way it's worded makes it sound like they're tired of hearing about Bionicle. And they forget that most of those comments were fans complaining that they shut down Masks Of Power.

In the live stream reveal for the Soundwave set, the designer points out the Mata hand pieces recoloured in dark blue, and says it's his favourite part of the set because he loves Bionicle. This further shows that Lego designers are Bionicle fans too, and would probably love to make new sets, but they can't.

71837 Ninjago City Workshops has a sticker that resembles the Adaptive Hau Nuva as a samurai helmet. But this still hasn't been confirmed by Lego or the designers.

The only confirmed Bionicle reference in a set this year is Tahu's canister in 910050 Antique Shop. But it's just the same build from 80054 Megapolis City from last year. 

On a lighter note, October 11th marked the 20th anniversary of Bionicle 3: Web Of Shadows. The entire Miramax trilogy is now over 2 decades old. 

2026 is already looking good for Bionicle, with Tahu heavily rumoured to be in CMF series 29. But Lego needs to do a lot better next year. Shutting down a fan project years in the making and cutting off 35 countries on the biggest market is not how you should treat your fanbase. ",32,1766944695.0,bioniclelego,5,0.97,False

I just wanted to know if y'all also have this experience when moving things from one container into another. 

For me it happens most often with food. For example ice cream. I know It's not the most fun to go get the ice cream out and shovel it out of the container into the bowl. But it seems like after I start the process. I just keep going. Ill fill that entire bowl with the thing I am moving into it. Not because I want that much but there is just something that is oddly satisfying about the actual process that keeps me unconsciously doing this. 

It happens with a lot of other things though. Like if I am supposed to be organizing cables from a box. I end up with all the cables out of the original box even the already organized ones organized ones. 

Oddly I only seem to notice that I have moved way to much stuff from one container into another container when it's significantly noticable. And therefore embarrassing. Like why do I need 3 enchiladas for lunch tomorrow? I don't. I just got into the motion of moving the food over and didn't realize I hadn't stopped. 

Other examples might be adding sugar/creame to coffee.

I'm mostly looking to make lattes but am curious to try pour overs, macchiatos, straight espressos, etc.

I'm mostly decided on the DF54 which seems like the de facto best budget grinder on the market right now. But I also read that conical burr grinders are considered to be more forgiving in terms of dialing in the grind size and they produce more body. I love full bodied coffee and I'm trying to spend as little time tinkering and dialing in shots as possible. Taking this into account, should I instead get something like the Baratza Sette 270.

Just to reiterate, cost is not a consideration. I just want the easiest way to make nice enjoyable lattes but I feel weird choosing the ""worse"" Sette 270 over the apparent second reincarnation of christ which is the DF54. Or if there's another solution (like getting a hand grinder for certain kinds of coffees), I'd be interested in hearing those too!

**Why This Pick?** 

 

Trevor Lawrence and company faced Indianapolis just a couple of weeks back and beat them by a very healthy margin. Of course, at that time, Phillip Rivers had yet to make his appearance and the game was in Jacksonville. Fast forward to last week, the Colts defense got absolutely dismantled by the 49ers (final score was 48-27…), and I have a feeling the Jaguars will be able to accomplish the same here. The Over has cashed in Jacksonville’s last 3 straight games and in the last 6 straight meetings between these two squads – today will be no different. Take the Over to hit.

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

As the ""diffusion line"" for Avant Brands (BLKMKT powerhouse), Tenzo captures consumers who want premium genetics without the premium price tag.

## 📊 The Numbers: Strong Fundamentals

* **70 positive reviews** (80%)
* **15 negative reviews** (17%)
* **3 neutral/informational posts** (3%)
* **Average sentiment score:** 7.33 out of 10
* **Ranking:** 18th of 21 brands (but recent drops are 9.0+)

## 🔥 The Powerhouses

**97 OCTANE SMALLZ: The Value Champion**
* **Review Count:** 13 reviews (15% of feedback)
* **Average Sentiment:** **8.55/10** (Perfect 10s on recent batches)
* **The Hack:** ""BLKMKT Caviar but cheaper""
* **Value:** $50.84 for 7g
* **Status:** Verified ""Smart Buy""

**AVALANCHE: The Heavy Hitter**
* **Review Count:** 5 reviews
* **Average Sentiment:** **9.50/10**
* **Flavor:** ""Sweet and chocolatey scent and taste""
* **Comparison:** Favorably compared to expensive competitors like Irony

**TERTIARY PERFORMERS:**
* Espresso Gelato: 8.93/10 - Unique terp profile winner
* Apple Banana Candy: 8.96/10 - Consistent quality
* Fun Trip (Milled): 7.68/10 - Good budget option

## ✅ What Positive Reviews Highlighted

1. **The ""Avant Advantage""** - Consumers know Tenzo is grown by Avant (BLKMKT). ""Comparable to BLKMKT"" at better price.
2. **Packaging Innovation** - Clear jars allowing visual inspection builds trust
3. **Unique Terpenes** - Espresso Gelato (Coffee/Vanilla/Gas) and Avalanche (Chocolate) distinct from endless fruit strains
4. **Format Value (Smalls)** - Smallz line is hit-after-hit. Consumers accept smaller buds because potency and cure are premium.

## ❌ What Negative Reviews Criticized

1. **FLAVOR DISASTERS (Banana Apple)** - Multiple reviews rated **0.0/10**. ""Disgusting taste,"" ""inability to stay lit,"" ""worst product ever smoked.""
2. **Milled Competition** - Reviewers explicitly state they ""prefer Nugz"" for milled flower
3. **Moisture Packs** - Complaints about moisture packs ""annoying"" or affecting smoke

## 💎 Best Products

* **Winner:** Avalanche (9.50/10) - Sleeper hit delivering premium ""dessert"" terps
* **Runner-Up:** 97 Octane Smallz (8.55/10) - Volume leader with Perfect 10 spike. Perfectly encapsulates brand promise.

## 📈 Key Insights: Why Tenzo Ranks 18th

**Why the historical ranking:**
* Banana Apple disaster (0.0 scores) anchors historical average down
* If you remove that failed SKU, average jumps significantly

**Mastering the ""Mid-Premium"":**
* Found their lane with Smallz format
* Not trying to be ""Budget"" (Nugz wins there) or ""Ultra-Premium"" (BLKMKT wins there)
* They own the ""smart shopper"" middle ground

**Genetics Pipeline:**
* Access to Avant's genetics library = unfair advantage
* Dropping Jealousy and BLKMKT strains into Tenzo bags is winning strategy

## 💡 Current Status

Tenzo is the smartest brand in the Avant portfolio right now.

**Path Forward:**
* Expand the ""Smallz"" Line - It's the money printer
* Kill Banana Apple - Immediate delist
* Lean into Espresso/Avalanche - Unique dessert terps are differentiator

Currently at **7.33 (18th of 21)**, Tenzo is a **Strong Buy** for their ""Smallz"" and ""Avalanche"" SKUs.

I have fructose intolerance; honey and fruit juice give me urgent dumping diarrhea attacks.  
I have been Peating since the beginning of my symptoms which started 5 years ago after university stress (due to limited food sources, my Peating is actually only strictly avoiding PUFA). I eat boiled potatoes, white rice, grass fed red  meat (which cloggs my nostril no matter how fresh it is), grass fed butter, wheat, small amount of milk and thats it.

I am underweight. I have chronic constipation (I go every every 8 days cca).  
I have low vitamin D, low folate, very low vitamin C, high B12, low-ish ceruloplasmin, low-ish serum magnesium, low DAO enzyme, high TSH,High-ish ferritin low vitamin K, and test-confirmed SIBO. All these tests costed me around 1000 euro but it feels like I am throwing money and not getting anywhere. MTHFR normal. Completly mentaly exausted.

I am scared to nuke my gut with antibiotics because I am underweight.  
Thyroid stimulation feels similar to coffee jitters. I will try Cynomel and Cynoplus again when they arrive from Mexico. I had some problems with shippment.  
Vitamin D supplementation causes eyelid and calf muscle twitching.

I don’t have IBD, celiac, Hashimoto, or eds.  
Endoscopy showed mild gastritis and duodenitis, aspririn, acidic fruit and foods, chocholate, coffee agrravate the pain.

CGM often shows reactive hypoglycemia that balances on its own.  
It goes high, a little above normal (around 9 mmol), then drops to hypoglycemia and becomes \~5 mmol, all within under 90 minutes.

Bigger meals cause a feeling of distention and stomach stretching.  
I can feel meat burps 4 hours after consumption. I probably have gastroparesis or something that mimics it, but in Croatia they don’t have the diagnostics for it.

I’m very selective about coffee, to the point where I used to visit two or three cafés in a single morning just to find that *perfect* cup. 😉 For years, I avoided making coffee at home beyond using a V60 (which is still king for drip). Espresso, Americanos, lattes, and cappuccinos always felt out of reach. I tried the Picopresso (nope), then another espresso machine (also not great), and eventually resigned myself to café visits for anything espresso-based.

I almost pulled the trigger on a higher-end machine, but worried I’d end up where I’d been before, only with a very expensive paperweight. After some research, I landed on the Breville Bambino Plus as a Christmas gift.

My setup includes a bottomless portafilter, weighted tamper, blind shaker, WDT tool, puck screen, and a scale. I’m using a Breville Smart Grinder Pro (internal burr at 6, external setting currently at 12), fresh beans roasted within the last 30 days, and Mike Oro Italian beans.

**Day 1:** A steep learning curve. Espresso pulled too slow, internal burr at 5, external around 13–14.  
**Day 2:** Too fast, external grind setting around 15–16.  
**Day 3:** Nailed it. Internal burr back to 6, external at 12, 18g in / 36g out, 25 seconds on the dot. The result? Beautiful.

Americanos and lattes come out consistently good.

**Moral of the story:** the Breville Bambino Plus can absolutely produce a gorgeous cup of coffee that rivals what you get at a café and for less than five hundred bucks.",2,1766943470.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1pxx7cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1pxx7cu/yearend_loneliness_in_bengaluru_putting_myself/,Year-end loneliness in Bengaluru - putting myself out there.,"Hey everyone,

This is a bit out of my comfort zone, but I felt like sharing.

I’m 22 (almost 23), and I’ve nvr been in a relationship. During clg, I liked a girl who was also my best friend. When I finally confessed, she told me there was no future between us. I’m not even sure if she liked me back or not. After clg ended, we stopped talking. That was around two years ago, so I’ve made my peace with it and moved on.

Fast forward to now, I’m working in Bengaluru in the corporate world. With the year coming to an end, I’ve been feeling unusually lonely. Most of my close friends aren’t around here, and weekends feel especially empty. Some days, I just wish I had someone to talk to about how my day went, make spontaneous weekend plans, go out for a coffee, attend events, yk, the simple things.

I’m not writing this out of desperation, just honesty. I genuinely enjoy my own company, but sometimes it feels nice to have *s*omeone yk...

So, a brief intro about me (just in case someone knows someone, or this resonates with you):

* **Age:** 22 (turning 23 soon)
* **Location:** Bengaluru
* **Profession:** ECE engineer (corporate)
* **Interests:**
   * Video editing & cinematography
   * Exploring cafes (big foodie 🍽️)
   * Music events & live gigs
   * Stand-up comedy shows

I’m more of a calm, observant person than a loud one, and I value genuine conversations over small talk.

Not sure what I’m expecting from this post, maybe connection, maybe conversation, maybe just being heard. If you relate, feel free to comment or DM. And if you know someone who might vibe with this, well… shooting my shot, I guess 🙂",1,1766943449.0,BangaloreSocial,0,1.0,False

This post is not intended to debate whether this is true or not. Instead, let's assume this is true for a moment. My question is, if your physical appearance is not considered to be attractive enough to a woman who doesn't know you at all (or well enough to tell your personalities), then how the hell do you showcase your personalities, your values and all your other 'internal qualities' etc to impress her?

I am genuinely asking this question because I think a person can only tell these 'internal qualities' of another person after going out on dates or getting to spend time with them. Let's say I saw a cute girl in the coffee shop. We have never met each other before. I am not handsome or hot enough in her eyes, but I have got good 'internal qualities'. Our assumption says this should be enough to remedy my appearance. How am I going to show that to her so she would go out on a date with me? You are not going to go up to her and say 'hi, my name is X. I am a cheerful person and I value kindness in my everyday life.

1pxx3h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1pxx3h1/i_have_autism_i_spent_20_years_reverseengineering/,"I have Autism. I spent 20 years reverse-engineering human behavior because I didn't get the manual. Here is the ""Source Code"" to reality I found. (Part 3)","Now that I have your attention, we can talk about completely unimportant things.

Today’s cultural program includes:
1. Why I started writing, what I want, and what this looks like inside my head.
2. The deep meaning behind my theory.
3. A lot of useless information.

This text has no clear structure. It is essentially a stream of my consciousness.

**How did I get to the point where I’m writing this?**

It’s a long story. I will try to drain all the ""water"" and leave the minimum information necessary to understand the context.
It happened in the summer of 2025. It all started with a fateful meeting with an old Friend.
*(Note: I must mention that I use the word ""Friend"" only for exceptional people. I know them perfectly, and importantly, they know me perfectly. Everyone else is a ""comrade,"" ""acquaintance,"" or ""colleague,"" but certainly not a Friend).*

I won’t use real names, but I don’t want to invent fake ones either, so I’ll label the characters in my own way. The Friend knows my life positions well and is fully aware of my worldview. He is one of the few people who has known about my theory for a long time.

**Important detour:**
It is also worth mentioning that I do not use terms like ""currency,"" ""ROI,"" or ""system"" for myself internally. It doesn't matter what you call it. These formulations were chosen simply to explain the essence. You are free to call them whatever you like. The main thing is that it fits into your worldview and that you can attribute any situation to at least one of your currencies. I could describe my theory from the point of view of magic, fortune-telling, psychology, or anything else. But I chose this format because I like it the best.

We need to agree on the basics right now:
* Everyone does everything for themselves (or at least everyone does everything *by* themselves).
* A human is a separate, standalone system.

People are very different. It depends on their family, culture, and that unique set of bruises and bumps everyone managed to acquire. Culture and environment throw their rules of the game on top. In one place, it is customary to walk over heads to be respected; in another, it is customary to be humble and helpful. We simply learn to survive and receive pleasure (that very payoff) in ways that worked in our past.
Therefore, when it seems to us that another person is behaving strangely or illogically, most likely, for them, it is absolutely normal. They just have a different set of instructions in their head, written by their past. We have different maps of the terrain, so we choose different routes.

**This reminds me of an old parable that perfectly describes this bug in perception:**

— King, judge us! He says one thing, and I say another!
Solomon listened to the first one and nodded: ""You are right.""
He listened to the second one, who said exactly the opposite: ""And you are also right.""
The scribe couldn't stand it: ""But King! They contradict each other! They cannot both be right at the same time!""
Solomon looked at him and answered: ""You know... you are right too.""

And Solomon is right here, too.

Anyway, I got distracted. We were talking about the history of creating this ""project.""
So, we are sitting there, discussing his problem. I seem to have helped a little, and he says:
— Why aren't you helping others yet?
— What do you mean? — I ask.
— Well, we talked, and I immediately felt better. You said a long time ago that you would push this to the masses.
— You know the context. It's easy for you to understand my words. But how do I convey this to a person who knows nothing about it?
— You were able to explain it to me, which means you can explain it to others.

Then there was an hour-long discussion about the feasibility of such actions. This thought did not leave my head. Initially, I planned to become rich and successful first, and only then start promoting my ideas. But one fine day, I decided to act.

More than one person wrote to me that this is all a stunning marketing campaign, and some even believe that I am not alone, that a whole team is working here. I am very flattered that my work is evaluated this way.

Of course, **being a systematic person, I decided to approach this efficiently. If I'm going to do it, I might as well do it on a large scale.** It all started with planning.
I began to study options for promoting my ideas. First, a concept was developed. A decision was immediately made to broadcast to an English-speaking audience. I had an X (Twitter) account; I set it up and started writing something there, as recommended on the Internet, with the aim of gaining subscribers and transferring them to Substack later.
In the first days, it went well, but then I got shadow-banned (too much activity), and I had to look for other methods of attracting an audience.
It so happened that during this period I met another friend, with whom I decided to discuss this dilemma. He was very glad that I finally decided on such actions and recommended that I write a post on Reddit. I liked this idea, and we started creating the text for the first post.

Fortunately, I already had a practically finished text, which only had to be slightly corrected and translated into English. I wanted the English version to retain my handwriting — the way I convey information. And **Gemini** helped me with this: I threw in my text and the request *""adapt this text into English without changing the author's idea.""*

This all happened in one day.

*(Note: The goal of the first post was to attract attention and intrigue with my persona. I have quite a lot of experience in negotiations and promoting various products, so in general, I know how it works. If you're going to do something, you need to attract as much audience as possible).*

And then, you know the rest. But what happens next?

**I have three strategic tasks:**
1. Get as much reach as possible.
2. Free up more time for myself so that I have the opportunity to write.
3. Replenish all currencies with the help of this project.

Attentive readers have already seen the financial aspect in the phrase ""all currencies.""
**I won't hide it: any sustainable system must have a positive energy balance.** In the long run, I would like this project to support me. But I do not plan to sell any training courses, audits, breakdowns, and similar shady things. Everything I write will always be in the public domain for everyone. The exception is the possible release of a book, but I still have to live to see that day.

**What am I even trying to convey?**
It's time to become better. This is a theory of thinking. A philosophy, if you will.
The idea is to create an effective mechanic for interacting with your inner ""Self."" After all, you can teach yourself to think better, and this will directly affect the quality of your life. **You don't need to do as I do.** I am just an example of organizing one's thoughts. You, as a separate unique system, must develop your own effective way, and that will be the best thing you can do.

I will try to help with this.
""The Payoff Threshold"" is an attempt to convey information conducive to effective thinking, not an instruction manual.
Everyone must decide if this suits them or not. In any case, there will be those whom this helps.
It is also important to say that this is intended not only for neurodivergent people. Neurotypical people can influence their thinking with the same efficiency. It depends on the specific person.

***

**(Appendix: The Price of Updates. In the language of my theory)**

What does ""changing your mindset"" actually mean?
It’s not just ""thinking positive thoughts."" It is **rewriting the legacy code** your system runs on.

Imagine a person who earns **Symbolic Currency** (Status) by bullying others. In his current firmware: Insulting someone = Profit (feeling of power). His system is stable. He justifies it perfectly.

For him to change, a **Critical System Failure** must occur.
It’s rarely a single ""miracle."" Usually, it’s a cumulative error stack that leads to a crash: he gets fired, his partner leaves him, or he meets someone who destroys his worldview.
At that moment, **Hyperinflation** hits.
All the currency he saved for years (his ""toughness"" and authority) becomes worthless paper. Worse—it becomes **Debt**. What he was proud of yesterday, today causes Shame (negative Moral Currency).

This is why most people revert to their old lives.
When you change your mindset, your internal balance sheet crashes into the red. It hurts. You are spiritually bankrupt.
Most people cannot handle this deficit and roll back to the old firmware just to feel ""solvent"" again.

My goal is to give you the manual to survive this crash and enter a stable market.

***

**Future Plans**

My next post will be about human relationships, expressed through the prism of love. We will touch on this topic there.

I am not asking you to follow my theory blindly. **I am not a guru.**
Verify everything in practice. If my theory does not work in your life—throw it away. Efficiency is the only criterion for truth.
But you won't know until you try.

I have several friends who used this framework to fix their lives. They are the ones who convinced me to share this with you.

I honestly don't know exactly what happens next. I have a plan, and I am following it.
Writing these posts drains my battery significantly. Since I work 12 hours a day, I realized that a strict ""once a week"" schedule might be impossible for me right now. But I will try to write as often as my CPU allows.

I tried to use as little terminology as possible here; I wanted this text to be simpler. **I intentionally use simple examples. We are not ready for the complex ones yet.**

I think I will split the content into two formats:
1.  **Dev Logs (like this text):** Free-flow thoughts about life in its various manifestations.
2.  **The Source Code:** Unfiltered theory and terminology.

I have already created a **Substack** and **Medium**, where I uploaded my previous two posts and this one.
Also, **today another publication will be released**, which I mentioned above (about Love). I will publish it only on my profile and Substack to avoid spamming the subreddit feed too much. So go to my profile and check it out if you are interested.

I will link all my social networks in my profile, but don't expect an active X (Twitter) feed yet — I simply don't have the resources to do it all.

That seems to be all for now. Of course, I would like to write more, but it is difficult for me to tie it all into one text.

I read on the internet that on Reddit, it is customary to write a TL;DR for long posts:

> **TL;DR:**
> You have to guess. Is this a 500 IQ master plan to sell you a $9999 course? Or is it just an autistic guy who drank too much coffee and treats humans like math problems? **The scary part is: it looks exactly the same.** I leave you in total confusion. But one thing is 100% true: your cat doesn't love you. It is just calculating the ROI of the tuna you provide.

Kaylee wiped the tears from her eyes as she stood between Lucky and her dad, both wearing their respective military uniforms. She flinched as the shots from the seven ancient M14s rang out three times, and the casket was lowered into the ground. This was supposed to be a happy day. Her graduation day. Not the day they buried a friend.  

""It's not fair. Smokey pulled Tompkins from that wreck. Saved his life. Then he gets clipped by debris? It was the first race of the season!""  

Her father put a hand on her shoulder as they walked back to the old truck. ""Kaylee, life isn't fair. We are born, then we live until we die. We just have to make the struggle in between matter. Tompkins will recover. He will get the chance to see his kids grow up because Smokey ran onto that track to pull him out of the fire. That matters."" He pulled out an unsealed envelope from inside his jacket and handed it to her. ""So does this.""  

Trying to read through tears, Kaylee gave a dismissive laugh. ""MIT? Community college won't get me to space, Dad.""  

""Wipe your eyes and look again.""  

Doing as she was told, Kaylee looked at the envelope again. In deep red ink were the letters MTI. Martin Technical Institute. The premiere school in the system for all things space. After pulling out the papers inside her eyes went wide.  

""Off-world tuition...paid in full?!""  

""You are something special, Kaylee. I see it. Smokey saw it. He felt you should have the best education possible. When I told him I couldn't afford to send you, the old man went and paid for your courses himself. In the time between his birth and death, Smokey tried to make everything count. Like pulling Tompkins from the fire. Like dragging Lucky back from that ambush with your grandpa. This is one of those things Smokey did that matters. Now it's your turn.""

Dark clouds outside the hospital room that the small group was squeezed into put a damper on the occupant's moods. A blue green Jalavon woman sat in one of the two bays of the room while a black-haired human woman and a smaller, brown furred Sajvin sat on the unoccupied bed. A few scattered rain drops slapped against the window as severe storm sirens began to sound outside. The humming of machines provided steady background noise as the conversation continued. Ena'raa refused to look at the visitors, her attention elsewhere.  

""Making our food last wasn't a worry. I had 30 days of MREs stashed, and we only used a few of them. I used the fresh items first. Exodus stew fed our crew for nine days."" Ena'raa still made no effort to make eye contact with her two interviewers. ""The oven drew too much power, so I used Kaylee's exhaust manifold oven to make la'ri'na flat bread.""  

""Inventive,"" Juarez said from where she sat. ""What was the state of the crew during this time?""  

""Tired.""

""Kaylee, what are you doing?"" Ena'raa asked, confused why the engineer was bent over and singing into the vent.  

""Something has been beeping for days, and I am going to find it,"" frustration clear in Kaylee's voice.  

Ena'raa watched as Kaylee worked her way along the wall. Loose locks of hair were annoyedly brushed behind her ears. The woman's eyes were dark and sunken.  

Concerned, Ena'raa approached the human. ""You look like a spirit of death. When did you sleep last?""  

""Yesterday. I'm fine,"" Kaylee said dismissively.  

Unconvinced, Ena'raa decided to ask about the real reason she had sought out the engineer. ""Kaylee...that thing I talked to you about...""  

The human paused for a moment, bent over in front of another ventilation duct then stood bolt upright. ""Oh my god, I completely forgot. How soon do you need it?""  

""Soon.""  

""Soon?""  

""Very.""  

Kaylee stretched with a big yawn. ""Ok. Um...do you have any black tea? My Mountain Dew went missing and I could use the caffeine.""  

""I do. I still find it surprising you don't drink coffee like every other human.""  

The human's face scrunched up in disgust. ""Vile bitter bean juice? Gross. Bring it to engineering please?""  

\------- 

CRASH The sound brought Ena'raa up short outside the door to engineering.  

""That fucking stupid, feather brained, sexist, racist, money-grubbing reptile!""  

She had never heard Kaylee swear before, or even insult someone.  

""Kaylee? Is it safe for me to enter?"" Ena'raa held the large thermos of tea so it would be visible from inside the compartment.  

""Oooh please!"" Kaylee snatched the cup with eagerness and took a couple swallows before something seemed to register. ""Did you hear that?""  

""Yes. What happened?""  

""I, um...I found the source of the beeping when I went to get the..."" she waved at the item on her workbench while sipping from the thermos. ""Kuautli had a long-range transponder communicator in the guest quarters. It is on the same frequency as the jump buoys, which makes sense since the Quetzal built the network on this side of the quadrant. The beeping was about unread incoming messages. It was password locked but the obsessed turd used Xoe's full name. He was communicating with the pirates, and they are angry at him. Seems we were supposed to be an easy mark for the Empire to capture those containers.""  

""Have you told Mal'katkik?""  

Kaylee dropped the communicator into a drawer below her drafting table and slammed it shut. ""No, I haven't. Would you tell him? I need to finish this thing for you, then come up with something for the grav system in bay two, and finish bracing the ship, and...""  

\-------- 

""She made this thing?"" Katel questioned, indicating the box that was the focus of Ena'raa's attention.  

""Repurposed."" She stared through the glass door of the mini fridge turned incubator at the two speckled eggs within.

Kaylee closed her eyes and let the sting of disinfectant in the split above her eyebrow burn.  

""You know you don't have to fight them, right?""  

""Mei'lana, those jerks don't get to pick on you just because you are small for an Altestri. Besides, being a semi-aquatic subspecies isn't something to be ashamed of.""  

The Jalavon woman narrowed her eyes at her human friend while carefully applying an at-home stitch kit to Kaylee's forehead. Her own crest began to flush red in building frustration and standing out against the light blue green of her skin. ""No, it's not. You also don't need to fight my battles.""  

Kaylee glanced away and mumbled; ""You know I don't like bullies."" Putting a more confident face forward, she continued. ""Besides, all that training I've been doing since we were kids was working. I just didn't anticipate the tail to the face.""  

""Well, be careful. I don't want you to get kicked out of school. I intend to beat you in the build off next month.""  

//////////  

""...investigations into the crash are still ongoing. In other news, the provisional government is set to receive the first representatives from the Jalavon enclaves and several Quetzal corporations tomorrow...""  

The vid screen flashed near the ceiling in the corner of the room. Raging black clouds outside darkened the windows of the waiting area they occupied to nearly black. Sheets of rain battered against the clear sapphire windows as the building creaked in the wind as Mal'katkik stared out into the dark and a flash illuminated the room.  

""What I wanted to do was throw him out the airlock. Jay'an wanted to pluck him first, which was tempting. Hoban and Wally discussed some...very creative ideas. It was the doctor that surprised me though. I knew he had been sending reports on us back to corporate since I started with Tsunblu, he wasn't nearly as secretive as he thought. However, when he heard about the ship being sold out to pirates, that old snake turned on Kuautli.""  

""What did he say?"" Maria asked from beside him, also looking out at the storm.  

""That Quetzal tradition says the attacked shall behead the attacker. However, we should let Xoe decide when she woke up. If she didn't, well...""  

\-------- 

""I brought you some fruity hard candy,"" Ena'raa said as she set the bag down beside Xoe where she lay on her stomach in the bed. ""It was supposed to be for your hatchling day, but the doctor says you need to get your sugar levels up.""  

Weakly, Xoe snatched a piece of the candy from the bag with her long, forked tongue. ""Thank you. We don't lay eggs though.""  

Ena'raa smiled. ""Yea, yea. You are just as weird as the humans.""  

""How do you feel?"" The captain asked from the other side of the bed.  

Xoe closed her eyes with a wince. ""My head hurts. Everything feels soft and downy.""  

Wally poked his head in the door and waved. ""Hi dudette. Nice to see you awake. Can I ask you a question since the doctor isn't here?""  

Xoe groaned as she shifted positions. ""One.""  

""How does something like Mountain Dew effect Quetzal?""  

""Umm, all sodas react poorly. Especially mixed with nectars from the home world. The caffeine messes with brain chemistry.""  

Mal'katkik left Ena'raa with Xoe and guided the cargo handler into the corridor. ""Wally, what did you find?""  

""I found Kaylee's missing soda in the guest quarters when I went in to give Kuautli his meal this morning. I thought it might have explained his behavior.""  

Ena'raa ran out to the men, panic clear in her eyes. ""Xoe is having a seizure!""  

""Wally, help Ena'raa restrain Xoe. I'll find the doctor.""  

Mal'katkik ran for the crew quarters but collided with Jay'an walking the other way packing a tank of welding gas. ""Where's the doc?""  

The larger man shifted the heavy cylinder in his arms, taking a moment to think. ""Um, I saw him going to check on the prisoner.""  

The captain reversed direction and sprinted down the corridor leaving Jay'an standing confused. He slid to a stop in front of the sealed guest quarters and released the exterior lock. Opening the door revealed only one occupant. The jade feathered form still and restrained, facing away from the door. Frustrated, Mal'katkik locked the door back up quickly and turned to check the bridge, nearly knocking his engineer to the ground in the process.  

The void suited Kaylee stumbled back. ""Woah Cap, slow down. Who's dying?""  

""Possibly Xoe. Have you seen the doc?""  

Kaylee paused, appearing to access how serious Mal'katkik was being for a moment. ""No, I've been welding in bay two. What's going on?""  

""Xoe needs help. We may need to make that last jump now. Is the ship ready?""  

""We can't!"" She ran her hands over her hair in her frustration. ""I haven't come up with a fix the grav manifold!""  

""Then don't fix it. Just get us going,"" Mal'katkik said while stepping around Kaylee toward the bridge.  

""Without that generator, we get torn apart if we try. No one would even know we failed. I don't want us to end up like the Thunder Child."" Kaylee threw her arms up in exasperation as she spoke.  

The captain stopped, turning back to his engineer. ""Is there some way to bypass the damage? Or patch it?""  

""No, the manifold is monolithic. I can't weld the alloy with the equipment we have, and the runners are tuned so that the plasma distribution is even. You can't just add length without causing more problems.""  

""Can you improvise?""  

""The manifold directs plasma. You can't just..."" the fatigue and frustration suddenly left the engineer's face, a bit of the light usually seen in her eyes returning. ""...but...maybe I can...Jay! Come with me. Leave the tank.""  

The approaching large brown Jalavon grumbled as he set the canister down in a wall alcove but followed Kaylee obediently back the way he came from.  

""We need to grab every extension cord we have and...""  

Confident in his engineer's forming plan, Mal'katkik turned and ran into the bridge.  

""Hoban, have you seen the doctor? Also prep us to jump as soon as Kaylee gives us the go ahead.""  

The nasal voice of Kuautli cut through the dimly lit compartment. ""You will do no such thing Hoban. We will wait right here until the vermin king's people arrive."" The serpentine avian stood in the dark corner by the cleaning droids charging station. He waved the captain over to the navigator's seat with Hoban's pistol awkwardly held in his hand. ""Close the door and take a seat.""  

""Sorry captain,"" the pilot apologized. ""He hit my bad knee from behind and I just collapsed.""  

""I could kill your featherless tail if you prefer. Now, sit captain. I insist.""  

Mal'katkik did as instructed, noting that Hoban had apparently been about to enter his jump calculations into the Nav console as his pad was laying on the floor. ""Is the doctor alive? Xoe needs his help.""  

""Xochitl is from strong stock. She will be a fine breeder for my line."" Wistful smugness dripped from the Quetzal's tone.  

A crackle came over the void suit radio Kaylee had rigged into a stationary unit. ""Cap, give me a few to rig this up. I'm sending Jay'an back inside to flip the breaker when I am done.""  

""What is the female monkey doing?"" Kuautli snapped. 

""Her job,"" the captain bluntly answered. 

Mal'katkik noticed Hoban very inconspicuously pressed a button, and an indicator lit up while he glared daggers at their captor. *I think I can work with this.*  

""So, if you were going to sell us out, why make a scene back at Centauri?"" When Kuautli turned to Mal'katkik, Hoban started quietly flipping a few more switches.  

""We couldn't have the *ostotl tlasolli* think we would just allow them to commandeer one of our ships. The company has a reputation to uphold."" Kuautli stepped back further into the corner and turned to face Mal'katkik more directly.  

""We?"" Keeping the avian distracted would give Hoban time. Fortunately, the Quetzal liked to hear himself talk.  

""Yes, we..."" Kuautli stiffened suddenly, all his muscles contracting including the finger on the trigger of the pistol.  

Mal'katkik ducked as Kuautli flagged him while collapsing to the floor. The pistol, however, did not go off as the Quetzal had not flipped the safety. Behind the twitching figure glowed a single red eye. M03 sat there, clutching the feathered tail in one attachment arm, the other showing exposed electrical contacts.  

*""Keep the change ya filthy animal""*  

The staticky voice coming from the droid stunned the captain a moment before he uncurled from his seated crouch. He and Hoban shared a look before Mal'katkik snagged the pistol. As Kuautli started to stir, Mal'katkik heard an electrical arc snapping behind him and the Quetzal tensed again.  

""I think Jay'an might be right about that droid,"" Hoban said, fear plain in his eyes.  

""He might be,"" the captain agreed.  

""Guys?"" Kaylee's voice cut in. ""I have gravity. If we are going to jump, now's the time.""  

""Captain, finish entering the coordinates on my tablet exactly. I'll finish the sequence,"" Hoban said as he worked through the sequence.  

As Mal'katkik reached for the tablet, Kuautli reached out despite being stunned and yanked him out of the chair. The avian whipped his tail forward, flinging the cleaning droid into Hoban with a thud. The captain tumbled on top of his attacker, temporarily pinning him to the floor, however the serpentine form was able to twist and get loose, grabbing the abandoned pistol again. This time, Mal'katkik was in the back of the room and Kuautli was facing away from the pilot.  

Kaylee's voice again popped over the helmet radio. ""Guys, hurry up. I don't know how long these cables will hold together before they melt.""  

M03 had recovered itself upright and quietly grabbed the tablet. It rolled over to the nav console as Mal'katkik again tried to distract the attacker. ""How much was the Sajvin Imperium going to pay you?""  

""Tsunblu was to be paid double what the humans were to pay. Of course, the company would take both payments. After a small ransom, I would be returned and with the tragic loss of the rest of the crew, I would receive everything you were supposed to get. You would just have disappeared. A valiant hero lost to pirates.""  

Mal'katkik watched as M03 scanned the tablet. Hoban's indicators finally all turned green, and he initiated the jump.  

\--------- 

""Everything went to Oxalf damned chaos after that."" Mal'katkik continued to stare out the window. ""How is she?""  

//////////  

Kaylee wiped her hand across her eyes in frustration. ""I'm not joining the military, Mei Mei. I have no desire. I would rather do maintenance at one of the space ports.""  

The flashing lights of the hyper-loop tunnel flickered across Mei'lana's face as the autocab hauled them to Dejah on the slope of Arisa Mons for a weekend of rock climbing. She gave an annoyed rumble. ""You said you wanted to go to the stars, not change lubricants day in an out.""  

""I'm not going to end up spending years away from people I care about because some stuffy general says so, like my dad. Or worse, end up like mom.""  

Mei'lana tried again. ""Are you sure you don't want to join the Venusian Navy, like me? I can see if they will let us get stationed together?""  

""You know that isn't how the military works. You go where they send you."" Kaylee shook her head. ""No thanks. Dad sent me a message that Lucky was going to start a salvage operation in Centauri cleaning up the battle debris from the war. There is supposed to be a new station going together out there. Maybe he could use a hand.""  

//////////  

""It wasn't a seizure,"" Xoe said from her bed in critical care. ""I had severe muscle spasms due to low blood sugar. The doctors have me feeling much better.""  

""Do you feel up to giving an interview today? We can come back tomorrow,"" the furry Katel stated cautiously.  

""No, I can tell you what I remember, but I was pretty out of it.""  

Maria set her tablet on the bed tray in front of the feathered woman. ""From the time you woke up, what do you remember?""  

""I remember someone strapping me back down to the bed. I remember sparks and things scattered around. There was something thick and yellow on the floor. I heard a strange noise that seemed to be coming from Ena'raa. Wally was there.""  

""That would explain why she stopped talking to us."" Both Katel and Xoe looked at the human for explanation. ""The Altestri subspecies of the Jalavon almost exclusively have clutches of three eggs. It sounds like she may have lost one in the crash.""  

""She was grieving,"" the Sajvin concluded.  

""Please continue,"" Maria urged.  

""I remember a bunch of hands sliding me onto a stretcher. Someone asked about Kaylee and the doctor. Hoban was limping. Jay'an forced the airlock open. The fresh air was really nice. It smelled like fresh soil and smoke though. Kuautli flew by and knocked Jay'an down. I think he picked up a pipe off the ground. It might have been a fence post. I’m not sure. I remember this next bit clearly. Kuautli was diving down again and Jay'an yelled 'Tell me how the grass tastes, little snake.' Kuautli couldn't pull out of his dive in time and Jay'an struck him out of the air with the pipe.""  

//////////  

Kaylee frustratedly wiped her hands across her eyes. ""Jay, please. I need you to go back to engineering. I need you there just in case this doesn't work, and we need to shut down."" 

""You should not be working alone, Kaylee. Especially not in zero G. That was your rule,"" the large Jalavon man said, distressed. 

""Normally, yes. Cap said this is an emergency. Now toss the cords through the door and go, please. Lock down the hatches as you go, just in case.""  

To prevent any more arguing, Kaylee locked her helmet into place and stepped into cargo bay two. Reluctantly, Jay'an did as she asked with the cords and locked the hatch behind her. Kaylee activated the radio in her void suit. ""Cap, give me a few to rig this up. I'm sending Jay'an back inside to flip the breaker when I am done.""  

Inside the cargo bay was a cobweb of cargo straps to allow movement inside the maze of incomplete bracing she had been welding into place. She plugged the first cable into the socket by the door and threaded her way to the hatch in the middle of the floor. The cord came up short by a couple meters. 

Kaylee went back and grabbed the next two cables. She pulled the loops over her shoulders and drug them back into the tangle hand over hand. At the floating end of the first cable, Kaylee zip tied one end of the next cable leaving enough slack to connect the two later. She proceeded to string out the rest into the hole in the floor. Abandoning the cords for the moment, she then pushed the broken pieces of the plasma manifold roughly back into place and wrapped it with a roll of titanium tape from her belt.  

Routing the rest of the second cable, Kaylee proceeded to wrap it tightly around the damaged section of the manifold for the gravity generator until she ran out. The last cable locked into place, and Kaylee continued her wrapping. When she reached an undamaged section, the wrap reversed and doubled back over itself. At the end of the cable, she secured the coil with another wrap of tape and cut off the end of the cable. Kaylee tried to wipe sweat from her brow, forgetting about the helmet.  

""Damn it."" Kaylee shook her head instead and grabbed a welding clamp to secure the cable to a strut salvaged from the clamps of the Jakarta and welded in for bracing. Kaylee pulled herself out of the access hatch and plugged in the cable ends she had left disconnected.  

""Jay'an? You there?"" Kaylee pointed her feet at the floor of the cargo bay. ""Flip the switch for the gravity generator please."" She heard the generator start to hum and felt her boots contact the floor.  

Switching back to the channel to Hoban, she let the bridge know of her success. ""Guys? I have gravity. If we are going to jump, now's the time.""  

Her relief at the feeling of weight was short lived as she saw something from the corner of her eye. Drifting out of the access hatch was a wisp of smoke. Kaylee stuck her head back into the hatch to see her improvised electromagnet radiating heat.  

""Guys, hurry up. I don't know how long these cables will hold together before they melt.""  

A minute later, Kaylee heard the ship groan as the jump initiated. The bracing buckled as she felt the odd sensation of gravity oscillating. Then the loudest crack of noise she had ever heard threatened to deafen her even through the noise canceling of her helmet. Flames erupted from the access hole as the insulation of the cables caught fire, and plasma was let loose from the cracked manifold. She had no time to react as Kaylee found herself flung through the rat's nest of straps and bracing against one wall. Pinned there, she watched in horror as the hull began to rip apart. The plasma of the grav generator was nothing compared to what began to torch its way through the damaged metal. 

Kaylee attempted to grab the emergency supply box beside her, but it was out of reach as the wall beside her tore loose. She was flung free, tumbling into an atmosphere that should not have been. For a brief moment she saw the incandescent pieces of the ship spinning away until she fell into a bank of clouds.

1pxwzld,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1pxwzld/i_broke_no_contact_and_it_was_the_best_thing_i/,I broke no contact and it was the best thing I could have done,"Hi everyone,

I want to share a recent experience in case it helps someone. I broke No Contact after a month,not because I had hope, but because I needed it for myself.

I posted here not long ago asking for tips on how to get over a 3-month situationship that ended almost two months ago. Many people told me to block him and delete the chat. But surprisingly, what helped me the most was sending him a message.

The uncertainty was too much; I needed to take back control of my life and accept reality. More than accepting it, I needed to confirm once and for all that it was really over.

My situationship had an unequal power dynamic and a significant age gap. Staying silent, waiting for a message I knew was never coming, felt more stressful and painful than any potential rejection. The anxiety of not knowing was consuming me.

So, I sent a simple message with zero expectations for a casual coffee meet up.

I’m 99% sure he’ll ghost me or not reply. But for my own peace of mind, I needed undeniable proof that he is not coming back. This wasn’t about self-esteem or respect (though those matter). It was about my specific circumstance, which required this step so I could finally rest.

Sometimes we need two or three moments of clarity to truly confirm that something is definitively over. Don’t feel ridiculous for needing that. You acted according to what you felt. If the other person doesn’t come back, then you know. That’s the confirmation you needed.

It reminds me of the phrase: “Of course you can go back, but there’s nobody left there.” Sometimes you need to feel that sense of abandonment to finally close the door and let go.

I’m sharing this for one reason: if you feel you need to send that last message for your own peace:for freedom, for closure; you’re allowed to do it.

Don’t be guided only by the “unwritten rules” of breakups or situationships. You can break those rules. It’s your life, and you have the freedom to choose. Of course, you’ll have to face the consequences (rejection, silence), but no one can force you to follow a script that feels like it’s hurting you.

I say this especially because we often turn these informal dynamics into a bureaucracy: we create a thousand rules, steps, and labels about how to act, how to feel, when to text, when to block… when in reality, only you know what you need to do to move forward.

Why so many rules? Sometimes you just need to act according to how you feel. Life sends you signals; what you’re going through is a lesson. Every relationship (or situationship) is unique and part of your personal journey.

Do No Contact if it works for you. Block if you need to. But you also have the freedom not to block, to send that last message. The ultimate goal should be your inner peace.

Don’t let other people’s experiences completely define yours. Listen to advice, reflect on it, and then act with caution and common sense.

Sending strength to everyone. Sometimes the bravest step isn’t staying silent, but speaking up so you can finally close the chapter.

P.S.:  I’ve written this post two weeks ago but I’m publishing now, and he hasn’t reply yet. Even though I haven’t gotten what I wished, I feel like a weight has been lifted. I already have the answer I needed. I’ve learned that, for me, certainty,no matter how painful, is far better than endless uncertainty.",4,1766942948.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

GDP graphs climb like dopamine hits, startup unicorns pop like pop corns on hot pan, and headlines scream “world’s fastest-growing economy. But let us ask from ourselves, honestly 'Why does living feel heavier than ever?'
Because beneath the glossy macroeconomic triumph lies a quieter, crueler reality: economic inequality is choking the youth of our motherland and squeezing the middle class till it stops to breath. This isn’t drama. This is data with trauma.
The Wealth Gap: Not a Crack, a Canyon

Let’s not sugarcoat it.

=Top 1% of Indians control nearly 40% of the nation’s wealth.
=Bottom 50% fight over barely 15% of income.

This isn’t imbalance; this is oligarchic gravity, meaning wealth falling upward in the hands of ""Udyog Patis"", relentlessly. The economy for the middle-class people didn’t trickle down.” It teleported up and locked the door behind it to go in the hands of these billionaires and multi-billionaires. For the youth, this means something brutal: You can work harder than your parents, study longer than your seniors, and still afford less, poor, and cruel life.


# Middle Class: Too Rich to Get Help, Too Poor to Breathe

The Indian middle class has become a tragic character of a superhit Cinema— financially invisible yet economically exploited.

= Salaries are stagnant.
= Inflation is predatory.
=EMIs are eternal.
=Education fees rise like they’re chasing Bitcoin.
= Healthcare bills hit like ambushes.

A single medical emergency can erase years of savings. A decent education now costs more than a small apartment did two decades ago. And rent in metro cities? Bro—it’s daylight robbery with a lease agreement.
Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru—cities of dreams have become cities of debt-fueled survival.

# Metro Life: Aesthetic Poverty

Instagram shows cafe hopping, coworking spaces, neon nights. Reality shows ₹40k rent for a matchbox like apartment, ₹300 coffee, ₹10k for some nowadays mental therapy, and zero savings. Metro living for middle-class youth is now a performance of prosperity, funded by credit cards and emotional denial.

You earn
 You pay rent.
You breathe
 You pay bills.
You dream, you postpone.

This isn’t adulthood. This is economic exhaustion.

# Psychological Fallout: Silent, Severe, Systemic 

Let’s talk about the mental toll because nobody else does.

=Lower savings = constant anxiety
=Delayed financial independence = self-doubt
=Comparative pressure = chronic stress
Youth today isn’t lazy. They’re overstimulated, underpaid, and emotionally taxed and very angry from the government because of their false promises. They’re doing everything “right ""degrees, skills, hustle yet the finish line keeps moving. That messes with your head hard.
This is why burnout is the new baseline.
This is why sarcasm became a coping mechanism.
This is why Gen Z jokes about being “financially cooked.”
Haha. Funny.
Also, tragic.
# The Hustle Shift: Survival, Not Ambition

Let’s be clear. The rise of side hustles isn’t passion-driven anymore. It’s panic driven.
Freelancing, crypto, content creation, online businesses, digital gigs. Not because youth are greedy, but because one income feels like walking on a cake.

Entrepreneurship today is less “chasing dreams” and more dodging collapse.
Gen Z doesn’t want luxury. They want stability, freedom, and a life without financial stress.
Bare minimum dreams, right?.
but still unaffordable because of falling value of our Economy. 

# This Is Why It Matters

Economic inequality isn’t just about money.
It decides:

=Who gets to rest
= Who gets to risk
= Who gets to dream
= And who stays stuck in survival mode forever

When half the population lives paycheck to paycheck while a sliver hoards astronomical wealth, democracy weakens, social trust fractures, and anger simmers quietly.

This isn’t just an economic issue. It’s a national emergency disguised as normalcy by our honorable, respected uneducated hooliganistic politicians.

# A Bitter Truth 

Hard work alone won’t save you anymore. That era is gone. Systems matter. Policies matter. Distribution matters. And until inequality is addressed head-on not romanticized with hustle culture India’s youth will keep feeling like they’re running a marathon on a treadmill.
You’re not failing. The math is rigged.
Final thought: Hope, but with teeth

The youth are aware. Vocal. Digitally armed. They question. They adapt. They refuse blind loyalty to broken narratives. That scares old systems. Good. Because change has always begun when people stop pretending everything is fine. And trust me this generation isn’t quiet suffering. It’s loud awakening.
And yes, about our pookie politicians, they are the ones who separate Indian Youth only for just winning Elections, let me remind you readers something, the 'Vande Mataram"" debate which ran in the parliament for the damn 10 hours it was scripted. These Politicians are not real enemies. They act like being enemies only in Parliament but outside the parliament they all are friends. 
These Politicians tells us to live in our country and study here and get some low paying here, alright! we will do that, But what about your own Sons and Daughters?  they are study in abroad, they get a job in abroad and get settled in abroad. If you damn nincompoop politicians tells us to live, study, and then die also here, you should lead us by Example, by getting your own family members to do so.

From the time I was a very young child until I was 19.
I’m 20 now.

Since I was a baby and didn’t understand anything, up until I was 19, I loved my father deeply. I didn’t care about what he did in the past, even though there were serious problems between him and my mother, including physical violence. I witnessed many situations that should have made me, as a child, pull away from him — but I didn’t. I kept loving him.

I truly saw him as the best person, despite everything.

I always tried to show him love and importance. I would tell him “anything you want” and “I’m here for you.” If he sent me messages about fathers, I would reply with loving words, trying to make him feel valued and loved. But none of it really mattered.

I did everything for him. I woke up early while everyone else was asleep, made his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I cleaned, washed his clothes, ironed them.
Some people might say these are normal things — but they’re only “normal” when everyone does them. In our house, no one served my father except me.

I did all of this purely out of love. I never got money, never expected anything in return.

When he fought with my mother, I tried to calm things down, even though I knew deep down that he was wrong. I just didn’t want to believe it.

I kept loving him.

I was the only one who would sit with him, drink coffee with him. When he entered a room, everyone else would leave and go to their rooms — but I stayed.

The only times he showed me love were when I achieved something big at school. If I didn’t, he would get angry, yell, or completely ignore me.

Once, he was angry at my brother. I kissed his head, and he gave me a cold, judging look and went back to his phone.

I used to kiss his head and his hands.
Whenever guests came, I cleaned the entire guest area, washed the yard, burned incense, cleaned the bathrooms, and prepared coffee and tea — while my brothers were sleeping and didn’t help at all.

One memory that still hurts: when I was a child, I was crying in the car while he was angry. He yelled at me, dropped me off at home alone, and left. Everyone else was at work.

Another time, he was fighting with my mother. I stood in between them, and he threw a cup that broke on my face.

Once, my aunt insulted him in front of people. I defended him fiercely, cursed her, and told her not to talk about my father and that he was better than her. Deep down, I knew she was right — but I was lying to myself because I loved him.

I used to yell at my younger sisters if they didn’t obey him. They would ask me, “Why does he act like this?” and I would say, “He’s under pressure.”

But now, everything has changed.

My perspective and my behavior toward him completely changed. I noticed that I started hating his presence. I don’t want to sit with him anymore or drink coffee with him. I make two coffees — one for him and one for myself. When he enters a place, I leave it.

I’ve become distant, and he noticed. He started saying, “I’m your father,” meaning: Why are you treating me this way?

I swear I never did this on purpose.
It just happened.

I stopped obeying him.
I stopped doing things with love.
Everything I do now feels forced — just to keep the peace or stop him from calling my name.
I don’t even want to see him anymore.

Now I do things only out of duty, not love.

And it makes me sad.

Just three days to New Year’s! Luckily, the December 5th World Tribune has an article [Setting Concrete Goals and Determinations](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/setting-concrete-goals-and-determinations/) with important guidances from Daisaku Ikeda. Some samples:

>Set a Target—Then Go All In: “An arrow will not hit the target unless we take proper aim. The same is true of chanting. Our prayers come to fruition when we set clear goals and strive earnestly and persistently to realize them. … Chant specifically about your goals for the coming day, and then do your best to act on those goals, striving wholeheartedly in a way that befits youth.”

>Faith Is Action, Not Fantasy: “It is also important that we establish clear and concrete goals for what we hope to achieve each day and then pray and challenge ourselves to achieve each of them. This earnest determination gives rise to wisdom and resourcefulness, thereby leading to success. In short, to win in life we need determination and prayer, effort and ingenuity. It is misguided to dream of getting rich quick, expecting to encounter a rare stroke of luck or some shrewd money-making scheme. That is not faith. It is mere fantasy.”

One more takeaway before saying ciao.

I know that one of the leaders of the people over the hedges longs for the crazy fast-growing days of NSA and claim that turning away from that busy-ness in 1990 during Daisaku Ikeda’s 17-day visit, was a fatal flaw.

My boyfriend (24M) and I got into an argument over my birthday and now it’s turned into this whole thing.

So my birthday is coming up and he keeps talking about throwing this big party. Like inviting a bunch of people, renting a space, food, drinks, the whole deal. Normally that would be really sweet, but we’re not in a great spot financially right now. We both work but money has been tight lately, bills keep piling up, and we’ve been trying to be careful. I’ve been stressing about it a lot already.

I told him I didn’t want a big party this year and that I’d honestly be happier doing something small, like dinner at home or maybe just going out for coffee or something simple. I thought that would be the end of it, but he got really upset. He said I was “ruining my own birthday” and that he just wanted to do something nice for me. He also said it makes him feel bad that he “can’t give me more.”

That’s not what I meant at all. I tried to explain that it’s not about him not doing enough, it’s about me not wanting us to spend money we don’t really have right now. I’d rather not be anxious the whole night thinking about how much everything cost. He said I was overthinking it and that “it’s just money” but like… it’s not just money when you don’t have a lot of it.

Now things feel awkward and he’s kinda distant, like I hurt his feelings. Part of me feels bad because I know he was trying to be thoughtful, but another part of me feels like I should be allowed to choose how I celebrate my own birthday, especially if it affects our finances.

So AITA for not wanting a huge birthday party because of money issues?









Edit: He's always been big on celebrating things when it comes to birthdays and holidays we've been together for 5 years now and recently moved in together and that's when we started have money struggles because I'm in college still. He works a full time job, I picked a part time job as well but it's not helping much because I'm still paying for school.

I think part of why he’s so stuck on the big party is because of his family. Growing up, his birthdays were kind of ignored or always overshadowed by other stuff going on, and he’s mentioned before that no one really “made a fuss” over him.

1pxwnd6,https://i.redd.it/0h2x4ihtty9g1.png,"The final answer to ""What if Sans went on a Dusttale run.""","(Art by Rexetin)

  
Dusttale has been a topic discussed several times on the internet, with people arguing that it can't happen because of X or Y, some argued that it could happen, but differently.

However, all of these individuals were wrong. Dusttale would actually happen more differently than they think, and today I'll explain why:

First of all, we need to establish Sans' strenght, which may sound simple at first, but it's actually quite complicated.

You read the link? Yes? perfect. This is going to be Sans' stats at the start of the run:

ATK: 5

DEF: 5

HP: 340

Explanation for these starting stats are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/1mk9j8i/why_sans_is_not_weak_and_actually_has_more_than_1/).

Normally I would've given him a DT boost, however we need to take into account that this would make this less fun, as he'd obliterate the UT cast otherwise.

Now, let's get over to the rules:

1. Sans has all his knowledge and abilities from Dusttale (so this means that he remembers every reset, and no, he doesn't gain stolen magic as Dusttale Sans doesn't have it in the first place)

2. Sans doesn't regenerate stamina after every battle, but rather has to regain it through different actions (such as sleeping, making coffee, etc.), although he won't really need it a lot.

3. The human will be the final opponent.

Now, let's get started:

  
Sans will decide to start his genocide in waterfall rather than the ruins, as that will just put him on a hurry instead. He kills monsters in waterfall fairly easily, and his LOVE increases. He preferably tries avoiding Undyne, not because he can't defeat her, but rather the amount of trouble she would give and her undying form. Killing nearly everybody there would be easier, as it's a quiet place and easy for murders.

Once Waterfall is dealt with, Sans will likely move to Snowdin in order to continue his massacre.

Due to his higher stats, he easily cleared out multiple monsters, outside of the town of course, the town will be easier to deal with as there are multiple people there, meaning that he can easily get large amounts of EXP. Of course, Papyrus will try confronting him, but as Sans canonically kills Papyrus for last in Dusttale, he'd probably flee.

Now, he likely has around 12 LV due to reaching monsters we cannot, at the exception of the ruins.

Sans vs Undyne would actually be quite easy to determine here, considering how LV makes you care less, he will probably have around 37-42 ATK, which means 1110-1260 damage per-frame. Considering how he's faster, more experienced, skilled and has a better arsenal than Undyne, he will obliterate her base form, leading to undying happening.

Undying VS LV-12 Sans would actually be quite a tough battle for our skeleton here, however due to the points I stated early, he should beat her with high difficulty.

After the exhausting battle with undying, Sans would probably take it easy, the monsters in hotland aren't actually that hard to kill, so he should gain around 15 LV (if not more) with ease. Before going to the core, however, he'd probably decide to kill Papyrus, probably by stealing the kill from the human.

Inside the core, he will probably not even have a hard time, Mettaton NEO will get obliterated, and new home will be torn apart after he manages to kill Asgore. The human will walk inside of the last corridor and meet Sans, the fight will just be your average fangame with FDY patterns, except they change everytime you die, and they also oneshot you. Essentially making it impossible to get through.

Sans' stats at the end of the run would probably be 58 ATK, 24 DEF and 423 HP. With DT boost, they can get up to 82 ATK and 43 DEF with 5100 HP, making him very powerful.",2,1766942128.0,Undertale,0,1.0,False

This is a long shot but hey... silver lining, am I right? If you fancy someone whom you can enjoy the silence with and also talk to for hours nonstop, you might find this interesting.

**About me**  
I will tell you my actual name once we hit it off, but right now it's **Jeff** for you. I'm 25 and turning 26 next year (Almost a grandpa). I like Dogs, books, good films, a smoke at the right time and place, and a good dirty chai.

**Why I'm Here**  
I've had a few relationships in the past, and none of them worked out long-term for various reasons. Looking back, there was a sense of performance that I had to partake in to keep the ""idea"" of me alive in their heads. I believe that exhaustion contributed to things ending. After a long while of being just by myself and a lot of intellectualization, I realized that the more unfiltered I am, the more I attract things that actually *stay* with me. This proved true in almost every aspect of my life. So, the answer to the question is: When I lay things about me out in the open like this, it means I don't have to look over my shoulder waiting for some mask to come off. It allows me to just BE.

**The Details**  

* ***Books:*** My two favorite books I've read so far is *The Stranger* and *The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.* Currently reading *The Moral Animal* and *Why Buddhism is True*. 
* ***Music:*** My current daily listen is *Heaven* by Blaze. I also make some amazing Spotify playlists but there's nobody to share them with (hence why I'm here). 
* ***Films:*** I have 5 films I will never forget: *Before Sunrise, Filth, The Jacket, Trainspotting 2,* and *Requiem for a Dream*. 
* ***Career:*** I work as a **Video Game Artist** (started off as a designer). I believe I will always find purpose and joy despite whatever I am doing or the circumstances.  

I make an amazing tea for myself almost every morning while watching my dog play in the sun, it's one of my favorite parts of the day. I find happiness in the smallest things: the warmth of the sun on my skin, birds chit-chatting, the cold wind at night, and branches of medium-sized bushes grazing my skin (I promise I'm not crazy).

One of my biggest fears is that I would go on living my life not being witnessed by anyone. I would want them to notice each and every part of me. The good, the bad, and the ugly. the paradoxical traits that makes me, ME. I don't want to wither away like a piece of art hidden in a museum's vault nor be collected by someone who does not admire.

**Extras** (Randoms)

* I'm a huge lord of the rings nerd.
* I like to make things just for the sake of creating something out of nothing.
* I have a pretty cool PC setup.
* As of now I have sold 10 really cool big artworks to my friends and they love it (at least they tell me they do)
* I like getting into the lore and the details of anything, especially in films.
* I really like riding motorcycles.

**Socially**

* I have about 3 extremely close friends whom I would gladly call family; I would kill for them.
* I love to cook for other people and it's something I take a bit of pride in ( I make a killer spaghetti)
* I may not be the most altruistic person, but I try to help anyone that I care about.
* I like doing stupid risky things with my friends that don't always guarantee safety...but you only live once, right? RIGHT????

**Few philosophies** (or one)  
I view life through a mix of absurdism and a primal appreciation for the small things. I don't believe in a grand pre-destined plan, which I find very liberating for me because it means ""meaning"" is found in the immediate moment, whether that's a cup of tea/coffee, the warmth of the sun, or a conversation that lasts until 4 AM and you don't sleep the next day. I believe we spend too much of our lives performing for an invisible audience, letting people fall in love with versions of us that don’t exist. I judge character by authenticity and how you treat people who can do nothing for you. I’d rather be disliked for the raw reality of who I am than loved for a person I am not.

**What I Look Like**  
I would say I'm not on the unattractive side of things.

* **Build:** Lean, Brown Skinned, 70kg (hah, metrics!) and about 5'9"".
* **Features:** Deep-set eyes and high cheekbones... do these even matter?

**The Logistics**

* **You:** Ideally aged **18-26**, healthy, single, and female.
* **Dealbreakers:** Kids.
* **Communication:** I would like for things to come slow. Given the nature of my work, I'm pretty much always online on Discord, WhatsApp, and whatever else.

If any of this resonated with you, whether it’s the love for a life filled absurdity, the hatred of performing, or just the need for a good dirty chai OR SPAGHETTI...shoot me a message ;)

TLDR: wife makes a huge amount of mess and doesn't help with any of the houseworks. When I ask her to either help or try to make less mess, she comes up with excuses or says that I am ""OCD"" about cleanliness.

To start off, my wife has never been the cleanest individual. She came from, to put it bluntly, a hillbilly family. I mean that quite literally as they lived in the middle of nowhere in the Ozarks. They never had anything nice, so she never learned how to properly treat things and they did not value cleanliness. Last time I went over there, I found a dead mouse in the cutlery drawer that had been there for some time.

This wasn't as much of an issue years ago, as I have always been very clean and was able to keep up with her mess. Now, after moving into a much larger house, at her behest, having a kid, and taking on a role where I work about 16 hours a day, I'm downing and become increasingly frustrated.


A few examples:

She cannot open a cabinet or drawer without leaving the contents in total disarray and then leaving the door ajar. I'm not talking just a little out of sorts. Every time she goes into a space looking for something it appears like she just took the entire contents of that space out, jumbled them up, and just shoved them back in. You can tell wherever she has been because she never closes any door or drawer she opens.

She cannot eat anything without crumbs and pieces of food going everywhere. You can sit and watch her eat and crumbs just pour out of her mouth so that any surface she is eating on is covered and smeared in mess. She then just takes the crumbs and drippings and sweeps them onto the floor.

After innumerable requests she still takes wet and hot items and places them on wood furniture. I collect vintage furniture and she has ruined dozens of nice, valuable pieces by putting, for example, hot cups of coffee with wet bottoms on them.

We have a coat closet 5 feet from the front door. Every day she just piles her stuff on the floor and table next to it rather than putting it away when she gets in. The pile grows and grows and grows until I put it away. There are often leaking water bottles and opened food in this pile.

The cost in my time and money has been incalculable. I spend every waking moment outside of work doing chores. We have also had to repair and throw away so many things because her lack of care has ruined them. This wouldn't be as much of an issue if she contributed or didn't make an amount of mess way above the norm. When I talk to her about it, she treats me as of I'm crazy and as if she can't even see that there is a mess. I can point out that we have mice because she leaves half-eaten food everywhere and she just does not get it.

I've tried innumerable ways to rectify this. I've given her chore lists and she says I'm being too controlling. I've asked, begged, and pleaded. I've tried to demonstrate to her how to clean and take care of things. I've provided detailed verbal and written instructions. I've swapped tasks with her so that I do the things she say are preventing her from cleaning (literally the only chores she does are ""watching the kid"", which entails sitting on the sofa on her phone while the kid watches TV and calling me whenever she needs anything, ""doing her laundry"" which is doing 3 loads of washing a week and throwing the clean clothes on the floor, and taking out the trash twice a week). I've yelled. I've stopped doing chores for some time thinking that eventually she will get sick of the mess.

None of it works.

From the time I was a very young child until I was 19.
I’m 20 now.

Since I was a baby and didn’t understand anything, up until I was 19, I loved my father deeply. I didn’t care about what he did in the past, even though there were serious problems between him and my mother, including physical violence. I witnessed many situations that should have made me, as a child, pull away from him — but I didn’t. I kept loving him.

I truly saw him as the best person, despite everything.

I always tried to show him love and importance. I would tell him “anything you want” and “I’m here for you.” If he sent me messages about fathers, I would reply with loving words, trying to make him feel valued and loved. But none of it really mattered.

I did everything for him. I woke up early while everyone else was asleep, made his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I cleaned, washed his clothes, ironed them.
Some people might say these are normal things — but they’re only “normal” when everyone does them. In our house, no one served my father except me.

I did all of this purely out of love. I never got money, never expected anything in return.

When he fought with my mother, I tried to calm things down, even though I knew deep down that he was wrong. I just didn’t want to believe it.

I kept loving him.

I was the only one who would sit with him, drink coffee with him. When he entered a room, everyone else would leave and go to their rooms — but I stayed.

The only times he showed me love were when I achieved something big at school. If I didn’t, he would get angry, yell, or completely ignore me.

Once, he was angry at my brother. I kissed his head, and he gave me a cold, judging look and went back to his phone.

I used to kiss his head and his hands.
Whenever guests came, I cleaned the entire guest area, washed the yard, burned incense, cleaned the bathrooms, and prepared coffee and tea — while my brothers were sleeping and didn’t help at all.

One memory that still hurts: when I was a child, I was crying in the car while he was angry. He yelled at me, dropped me off at home alone, and left. Everyone else was at work.

Another time, he was fighting with my mother. I stood in between them, and he threw a cup that broke on my face.

Once, my aunt insulted him in front of people. I defended him fiercely, cursed her, and told her not to talk about my father and that he was better than her. Deep down, I knew she was right — but I was lying to myself because I loved him.

I used to yell at my younger sisters if they didn’t obey him. They would ask me, “Why does he act like this?” and I would say, “He’s under pressure.”

But now, everything has changed.

My perspective and my behavior toward him completely changed. I noticed that I started hating his presence. I don’t want to sit with him anymore or drink coffee with him. I make two coffees — one for him and one for myself. When he enters a place, I leave it.

I’ve become distant, and he noticed. He started saying, “I’m your father,” meaning: Why are you treating me this way?

I swear I never did this on purpose.
It just happened.

I stopped obeying him.
I stopped doing things with love.
Everything I do now feels forced — just to keep the peace or stop him from calling my name.
I don’t even want to see him anymore.

Now I do things only out of duty, not love.

And it makes me sad.

**Let's start with the non-linear narration: Barb's therapy.**
The scenes are: the first 10 seconds, 8:12 - 11:36 , then 21:34 - 23:56 , then 31:05 - 33:00 and finally 40:11 until the end.

If the video followed linear narration, these would be 3-4 consecutive sessions, but all the clips of Barb talking to the therapist are actually from her FIRST session: the therapy didn't happen until *after* Christmas when she overheard them talk to the kids. We can infer that at the end of the video, with Barb saying ""This is a Christmas gift to my son, that he doesn't even know about so I can't get the credit. So, can you fix me??"" and the therapist telling her they're out of time. 

When Barb talks at 21:34 she picks up right where she left off at 11:32, talking about Frank. The scenes in the middle connect to the therapy appointment because they start with Frank meeting John (after his name is mentioned) and at 21:34 it cuts back to the session after Frank and Barb discussed Christmas presents for the kids. Same thing at 23:57 when it cuts back to Frank and Barb arguing about dinner.


**Speaking of that scene:** we can infer some really interesting things.

First off, Barb in therapy accuses Frank of being uninterested and unhelpful even when he's present. Other than previously seeing him interested in the flamingos (when they were on holiday), this scene shows that Frank actually pays attention (he saw the package, unwrapped it and put the coffee pods away), but he isn't very communicative. On to their argument: Frank declares he's going on a walk, when in reality he's sneaking off to visit Santa with the grandchildren – John said that they had a 5 PM appointment ([at 14:56 of the vid](https://youtu.be/FbreYpgYLyo?t=896)), and when Barb says she's making dinner Frank replies ""It's [not even five](https://youtu.be/FbreYpgYLyo?t=1442)"". 

Barb gets a little suspicious and tries to join him on the walk, making the passive aggressive comment ""Unless you want to be alone"". Frank manages to dissuade her, but since she was pissed at him and asked whether she should even bother cooking, he replies ""I'll make a sandwich"" so she wouldn't need to cook for him. After this exchange Barb didn't want to cook just for herself & eat at home alone, so she decided to treat herself to a dinner date and have conversation with her favourite server (she probably knows Lauren's work schedule).... and THAT is why Barb ends up at the same Mexican restaurant that DD & Shawna are at, while everyone else is at the holiday lights display. 

-------------------------

These were the biggest beats / biggest connections I wanted to point out 😊 There's some smaller things as well though, namely: 

- **Christine asking everyone** ideas for Shawna's gift. She starts with Shawna, then Alicia, then DeeDee, then Jennifer, and finally John who gives her the winning idea of a rot day. This last one is not shown but said in dialogue. 

- When she asks Jennifer for a **Spa day with massages**, Jen replies ""Maybe in a few months?"", because she knows that Shawna is still recovering from the >!stillbirth!<. That's a callback to when Jennifer was newly postpartum and Greg had gifted her a massage for mother's day, she expressed she didn't want to expose her ""[sack of meat](https://youtube.com/shorts/JQg89GD06l8) body"" on a massage table. 

- Since Shawna didn't feel up to doing Christmas activities with Chickie, they split. John took the kids to Santa whereas Shawna spent the evening with her mom going Christmas shopping. They probably bought a magnifying glass for Piper thanks to Ty giving them the idea.

- When Delores sees **how upset Shawna is** after meeting Julie, she wants to distract her with food... but since she'd just expressed ""I'm tired of everyone pitying me"", DD went about it in a roundabout way. She said ""I'm hungry, shall we make a pit stop?"" to make it look like Shawna is doing HER a favour instead.  

- Speaking of Christmas shopping, at 20:57 **Barb says ""my granddaughter""** when referring to Chickie, and ""my grandson"" when referring to Max. She claims to want to know them in order to give them personalised gifts, but she doesn't even mention Piper other than ""Ugh, those other two"". So far she's the only grandchild that Barb refuses to get to know, as proven by the Barbie Dreamhouse gift.

- **Piper's quest for gifts** starts at the beginning of the video, when she asks her mom if she and Max will get presents, to with Shawna replies ""Yeah, we all will"". After that almost every time she's on screen she's [gathering gifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShawnaTheMom/s/VsDXWsZVr8) for her loved ones.

- Jennifer doesn't pick up on Shawna's **nonverbal cues** when she meets her at the park, both by barging in with high energy & excitement and by handing her Chickie before she's said anything, as well as taking her away without warning – something that inadvertently hurts Shawna. But [at 25:28](https://youtu.be/FbreYpgYLyo?t=1528) she notices John's loving and longing stare, which is why she asks him if he wants to hold the baby.

- Barb says at 23:53 ""I miss [my little children](https://youtu.be/FbreYpgYLyo?t=1433)"" and combined with her overreaction at the question ""Did you like being a mother?"", I think that's confirmation of my theory of [Barb's idea of motherhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShawnaTheMom/s/3MMcDFFo8M), a.k.a. unconditional love and devotion.

- S&J talking to the children at the end. Many people pointed out that whenever John implies that Piper loves Grammy she squints, but did you see that Shawna notices that and tries to hide a smile at 38:50? 🤭



**Aaaaand that should be all!** If you've made it this far, sorry for the wall of text! 😅 Here's a cookie and some cake 🍪🍰 Thank you for coming to my presentation 📊😊💗

I was on an early morning nature walk deeply thinking about my future as I navigate a life transition.  I started thinking about one option,which would be living very simply in a cheap unit. I have not drank coffee for some months but the thought occured to me that I could start again as a simple pleasure to be enjoyed on my newer more humble life.  I was then startled to actually smell coffee. So startled that I turned around instantly and instinctively to see if some random stranger had crept up behind me with a plunger (in the middle of no where).

This was not a memory or a recollection. My olfactory sense was activated and my nose actually smelled coffee. It was very startling and strange.

Apparently he was also good friend of my female colleague 20 yrs old. Mind you guys I knew that I’m a straight guy for 22 years of my life until this guy asked me out I didn’t know what it meant but he did confirm it by saying he asked me out romantically. I swear I was stunned said no, he took it positively however he didn’t come in for a few days his friend (my colleague) later spoke to me as how he had a crush on me since start and now he finally dared to ask me out and I should may be explore what if there is more to myself. 

Long story short I gave it a chance after the 2 date had the first makeout it was a bit weird tbh but he made it comfortable. Later slowly taught me things as how he is submissive and I’m supposed to dominant (I hope I’m using right vocabulary)and all and three weeks later we did the deed and it was really good didn’t know there was more to me. And hence I realised that I’m a bisexual. 

But the main issue is I’m back in India now and not going back for another 3 months however I’m not in touch with that guy coz it didn’t work out but I’m missing that a lot plus lately I’ve this regret feeling that I did something wrong and should not do it again. 

Looking for genuine suggestions and advice.

Thought I was straight, explored a relationship with a guy in London, realised I might be bisexual. Now back in India, feeling confused, missing it, and struggling with guilt. Looking for advice.",13,1766941406.0,LGBTindia,3,1.0,False

1pxwb01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1pxwb01/my_anecdotal_experience/,My anecdotal experience,"Hey I just wanted to post my experience with this in case it helps anyone else with their journey. I am not a medical professional and all of this is just my anecdotal experience. 

  
I was diagnosed with HSV2 in spring of 2021. The initial OB was awful. I never developed sores or lesions, but I had very intense prodromal symptoms for over 3 months. I'm talking nerve pain, red/dry/scaly patches of skin, tingling, burning, itching, etc. I stopped drinking, smoking weed, vaping, and was taking daily suppressive 500mg of valtrex and it just wouldn't stop. I finally decided to try stopping my antidepressants (Lexapro 10mg) despite my doctor telling me there was no correlation and that if anything the ssri should help because it helps me manage stress. Well I stopped the meds anyway and almost immediately began to heal. 

From there through probably my first 1.5-2yrs, I would have an OB any time I drank alcohol (especially clear liquors), but was able to resume with coffee and occasional weed plus vaping with no issues. I would have an OB probably every 3-4 months that would last a total of maybe 5 days from prodrome to fully healed. During this time I stayed on valtrex and was taking 1000mg of L-lysine daily. 

\*\*\*Taking L-lysine daily is the single most helpful tip I have come across for managing this diagnosis. I don't have sources but I would suggest researching the role of L-lysine in preventing viral replication and how it balances out L-arginine, which feeds the virus.\*\*\*

Over time the OBs have gotten further apart and when I do experience one I can feel something slightly off but I can't even find anything visible anymore. Everything I found online in the early days said it would get better within a few months to a year, but for me it really took like 2-3 years. It was a tough adjustment, but I found a lot of value in the time away from sex because it allowed me to build up a sense of self-worth that isn't based on sexuality and desirability. 

In the early days I lived on this subreddit and wondered why I never saw many positive outcomes, but now I think it's because after a couple of years it really does lighten up and people probably just move on with their lives. That's where I was at. I don't think I experienced a single OB in 2024 (year 3).

Following a breakup and several other abrupt life transitions, I made the decision to try out the Lexapro again - thinking maybe now my body has a handle on the virus. I was wrong. 2 weeks in and the horrendous never ending prodrome came back. I dealt with it for another 6 weeks, but things took a turn. This time I ended up with shingles as well as HSV2 reactivation around my ears and in my eyes. I have been doing literally everything possible to boost my immune system in addition to 3k mg of valtrex daily and 3k mg of L-lysine daily. I have been off the SSRIs again for about a week and things are quickly calming back down again. Within 24 hours of stopping the medication the burning, itching and nerve pain all ended and the redness is slowly subsiding. 

So I guess this is one part providing hope that it really does get better over time as your body develops antibodies and learns to deal with the virus. But also one part cautionary tale that if you are struggling with atypical recurrences, look into your medications because there is a direct causal link between psychotropic medications and HSV. Research on this correlation is limited, but I found a lot of information specific to fluoxetine which I believe is prozac? I would do your own research, but I see so may people here who are struggling and I would bet that a good handful are also on antidepressants thinking it's helping when it might actually be the sole cause of your misery.

You do not have to export CSV files or manually copy and paste numbers anymore.



Once the data is in your sheet, you have total control over how it is organized.



You can use our AutoCat tool to categorize transactions based on your own specific rules, not generic industry standards.

You can use the Transaction Splitter to break up a single large purchase at a superstore into ""Groceries"" and ""Home Supplies.""

You can build pivot tables to see exactly how much you spent on coffee last year, filtered by the specific date range you care about.

About 2 years ago, I was not afraid of going up to women on the street and I did this all without alcohol. I remember being extremely awkward but overtime I became very socially calibrated. 

I got this way reading books and watching youtube videos about social skills. I used to hypnotize myself with self help books about confidence and overtime I start to feel immune to rejection. Everything changed once I met my ex last January. I started off very smooth and charismatic like I learned to do. I want to preference that I was still being myself. I have just learned how to express myself well. 

So I ran dates at my favorite coffee spot, the gym, and restaurants. I had no problem holding a convo with her and we eventually became official. I try not talk bad about her but I can be silence about it anymore. In the relationship, I paid for everything and I mean everything. That includes a cup of coffee from starbucks. 

She never planned a date because she said I was a man. And she made fun of me for having feminine traits such as listening girly pop, watching female shows, and laying my head on her chests. She said a man should always be masculine. 

I am in med school so I was busy 24/7. I have complained alot about it but she is the reason why I prioritize nowadays. She would get mad if I didnt text her good morning every morning. If I check instagram but didnt reply to her text, she said I was ghosting her. And I used to go over her house and call her daily. On weekends, I used to give her back and foot massages just because. If got busy with school and couldnt talk to her, she would complain that I neglected her.

Im not blaming for losing my sense of self but I stop working out and gained 20 pounds. I stopped hanging out with friends completely. I only hung with my gf. The last thing is that she was extremely insecure as well. I was not allow to have female friends. However, we she met the male students in my class. She friended them behind my back on instagram. 

I ended up blocking a girl in my class because she would text me occasionally and my ex didnt like that. She also treated me like a child because she had limitations of how long I could stay at her house. And if I was bad, she wouldnt let me lay in the bed right her. 

  
She eventually broke up with me after she saw a pic of Sabrina carpenter in my instagram. And she also blamed that I am a med student so it wouldnt work anyway. She then went on tik tok and reposted a bunch of reels about a toxic exs. I am now blocked as well. 

Crazy thing is that I loved her and was ok with it until I heal from it. But it definitely ruin my confidence. The week we broke up, I found that I received a failing grade on my peds rotation and I got into a car wreck and totaled my car. Its a story for another day of why I failed peds because alot of bs involved. 

That was 3 months ago and now I finally feel good again. I lost the weight and I am doing great in school. However, I dont feel comfortable being close to women and I noticed I am scared to be smooth/confident again. I just dont see the point if the relationship is going to fail.

1pxw7qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pxw7qe/possible_that_sister_is_narcissistic/,Possible that sister is narcissistic,"I have always had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with my younger sister. I love and care for her a lot and have always tried to be there to support and protect her. She has never done the same for me, but I have always managed to find ways to excuse her behaviour. However, after getting together over Christmas I don’t really feel like it’s fair to me anymore to give her the benefit of the doubt. 

She stayed over at my place and then we went together to see my parents the next day. I was trying to do her a favour by driving her because she doesn’t have a car and can’t get to my parent’s via public transportation. I was with her for less than 24 hours and by the end I felt completely used and disrespected. She is typically self centred in her conversations, like she prefers to be the only one talking and if I share anything from my life her response is always about herself and how she has/is doing something better than me. Something as simple as sharing that I am going on a trip has to become a competition for her. 

She took this much further on our visit. First, her income is about 3x what mine is (I make under 100k a year), but she still expected me to pay for everything (gas, food, etc.) and gave me a broken, cheap, and thoughtless gift. I am really not the type of person to complain about gifts but it felt like she didn’t try at all and I actually put a lot of effort into getting her something she could really enjoy. I also went to bed early because I wanted to be well rested to drive us the next day, but she stayed up and was not really considerate of me trying to sleep. She was loud, sent me texts asking what our parents had planned for dinner the next day, and decided to have a bath in the middle of the night (after showering only a few hours earlier). The next day my partner offered my sister her homemade bagels for breakfast and my sister told her that her bagels weren’t as good as what she can get in the city. The last straw was on the drive to my parents house. My sister smeared the slush from her winter boots all over the fabric of the seats of my car (I think she may have done this intentionally as she is jealous of my car because she is currently saving for one). It sucks because I saved for a long time and bought it brand new. It’s the only major purchase I have ever made and the mileage is still less than 10k. I ended up telling her at this point that she was being inconsiderate, which made her upset. Then she made the conversation about how she needed me to get over it by the time we got to my parent’s house so she could calm down and enjoy her visit.

At my parent’s house she talked endlessly about herself and her job to my dad, which made it hard for me to catch up with him. Whenever I tried to share something about my life or ask about something in my parent’s life she would get up and walk away because it wasn’t about her. She complained about the gifts she was given by my parents, while again giving next to nothing to my parents in return. Then she rushed my parents to finish making dinner early because she arranged for her friend to pick her up and drive her to a train station before I was planning to leave. She mentioned that she was going to give her friend gas money and buy her a coffee for doing her a favour and that’s when it really hit me. She knows how to treat someone with respect when they do her a favour but refuses to do it for me (personally, I don’t think she actually did this for her friend either, I think she was just maintaining appearances). Not only did she never make that offer to me, she didn’t even thank me once. 

I am struggling now because these kinds of things also happened when we were kids. She used to bite or punch herself and tell my mom that I did it. I used to get in trouble for it a lot and it created so much unnecessary tension between my mom and I, as I would argue that I didn’t do it, that eventually I was put into foster care. That had a major impact on me and still does to some extent in how I feel about myself. I always believed she didn’t realize what she was causing but I am wondering if it was actually somewhat intentional now. This just feels very devastating. The worst part is now she uses me being in foster care as her trauma. I get how experiencing that situation would be traumatic for everyone involved, but she tells anyone and everyone about it and uses it as an excuse for her poor behaviour sometimes. I think it’s kind of insulting because, after taking the brunt of that whole situation, I don’t act that way towards others and never use my past as an excuse for my actions and behaviour.

Strange, cause I don't feel that urgency I usually do, or the fear or the doubt. It's been 15 years and I'm almost positive she hates the fact I exist. We have kids.

Weird, I could live with it for a long time cause I had some friends and still had fun occasionally. I mean, I generally choose playing video games then going out anyway so I guess it just kinda felt normal to stay in.

15 years! I was in my early 20s when all this started and now I'm almost 40! Worst part is the blur, the blur is my life, it's my mind and thoughts, the blur is the person in the mirror - I know him but also kinda don't.

I don't know what happened to me. I was charismatic, empathetic and social. Now some days I can't figure out if she's the narcissist or me. My therapist told me that generally questioning whether you're a narcissist or not usually disqualifies you but we looked into anyway.

I'm emotionally stunted, ptsd from my mom's suicide when I was 10, extremely abusive adoptive father, physically sure and mentally but what I remember the most is the intentional fear. Loud steps, waiting for you to walk past for the head slap, screaming and crying so loud while he just smothered me with a pillow laughing. My family ""well you're really testing his patience you know."" Or ""put yourself in his shoes, he just lost his wife and now he has to raise her kids.""

The heavy lifting was done for my wife - he just needs to mimic my dad and I'll completely involuntarily shut down. I'm in a great mood, sun is shining, honey I think I'll take the boy fishing. ""Must be nice, leaving whenever you want. Just deciding to do nothing all day. Because we both know if I tried to leave you'd be furious"" That one had me for years until one day I was like... ""You've never once said you're going out. I literally wouldn't care if you went out and came home tomorrow."" So stupid, being all proud of yourself for realizing you aren't something you could never even be. Years I thought I was abusive, mentally coercive and manipulative. All my friends drifted off, family loves her so to them I'm still the piece of shit. Had one really good friend that fully understood what I was going through but she turned it up to 100 and got him talking after some drinks. He told her everything I thought she was, narcissistic etc, which is shitty but she's fuckin good at being a friend or concerned lover when she needs something. Anyway, I hadn't heard from him and I mentioned in passing ""man I miss Tyler. I'm gonna call him."" And I remember these words ""at the Halloween party he mentioned to me that he needs a break from you because everytime you call him you're just asking for something."" So obviously I call him right away and say ""dude, I had no idea I was coming across as a user man. Just tell me next time."" And what followed was me witnessing a man falling apart for betraying his best friend, feeling like a cheap whore who got used by someone who he knew was using him. I laughed and said she's good man, look what I'm dealing with and he said ""dude, I love you to death and would kill for you but I can't put myself through this again. I'm a wreck. I know you're trying to get out. Call me when you do."" The day she broke Tyler was the day my actions were absolved of consequence.

Losing Tyler was the ultimate consequence. Not some legal battle, or financial settlement, watching her break my best friend and successfully isolating me further while keeping my family informed that I'm still crazy. She's multitasking my demise exceptionally well.

I've got my money and I'm firing out messages to rentals.

I carried the show for years, almost all 15, but this year I got tired. Tired of neglecting my writing, or painting and tired of working 50+ hours a week at a job I hate and going home pretending to be a father and falling asleep 20 min after dinner. ""I'm miserable, I literally feel myself dying everyday. I need to do something before my life completely collapses. I need your help."" Then she rephrases this to our counselor ""he said he's going to quit his job. Cause what? He doesn't like working. As if I do? You think I like waking up everyday and going to work? You think I'm happy? But I do it anyway because I actually care about my kids."" Or the time I didn't realize we were down to our last 20$ and bought myself a coffee. ""He's just so untrustworthy with money, literally stealing food from our children's mouths so he can have a coffee."" I'll admit it first, I have a tough time paying attention to details and really need to focus to retain. I spent years thinking my mental illness was my way of condemning my family to a lifetime of impoverished suffering.

No friends, no job. My Grandma, mom's mom, who took over attempting to raise me after my dad ""he needs to earn his way back into this family."" Sent me across the province to get rid of me. I was a handful sure, smoking weed, skipping school, sneaking out, etc. but I never got any counselling after my tenth year, let's review: January, mom commit suicide 2 days before her birthday and my dad believes it was because her cancer was terminal and they were in talks of divorce and she had nothing and he was v very very well off so she strategically killed herself so I could have a chance at a more privileged life. Great move on the surface but you looked your little 10 year old best friend, I had no friends my own age because she was all I needed, ""love you sweetie"" eye contact. Suicide. And you know what? After what I've put myself through with my wife I can no longer make the claims I used to ""my mom knew what she was doing and didn't care. Spent my life condemning her for leaving me with a man who broke her arm and she covered it up. She was sick though so she might not have realized how much of a monster she was leaving me with. January, mom dead. June, my best buddy's illness Duchenes muscular dystrophy caught up with him and took him. His mom was my second mom because as she said ""no other person has invested so much time into Robbie and given him a normal life."" Always crying when she said it. Weird, you lose your mom so you go to your second mom and lose your brother. She was crushed when her boy died and moved away. Then December, my birthday, Christmas, let's go. My grandfather, who would lambast my dad for treating me and different than his actual son ""he has our fucking name for Christ sake."" His funeral was on my birthday. And that folks, was the year my life ended. No counselling, depression wasnt real etc. Just a kid learning how much of a piece of shit he is.

So my wife had it pretty easy. I am so loyal to people because I'm scared of losing them that I had no idea what was happening, I was sure I'm broken. I tried to escape a couple times with panic laden ideas, not because I wanted to get away from her so much as I felt like I was unbecoming myself. I was sure I was gay, had to go, definitely not gay. Well I'm not gay because I'm trans blah blah. Destroying my self-respect with high school grade cries for attention. Well at least the trans thing got me to a counselor.

The counselor was like... You're not trans, maybe not even gay or bi. In your current state I'm talking to a man who doesn't even know what he's attracted to. You've been convinced you're no good to such an extent you've buried and forgotten who you even are. You're not trans, or gay, you're a homeless person looking for acceptance somewhere, looking for a community.

True, but also, rejected by the acceptance movement.

Back to work, just shut up and work - if you just work away at it for another 25 years you can die miserable, lonely, a failed father, a shit son, a completely inept husband and an utter disregard for so much potential.

I stay in places like this, and go to family events at my dad's because I'm smart enough to know I'm broken but not smart enough to start the repair process. It's like I use my own failures to mock everyone, or try and get them to take some responsibility for my atrocious adult state. It's easy to let people down without a hint of guilt because you've maxed out your guilt for one life.

Grandma died. Left me some inheritance b but made my dad the trustee. He's absolutely maniac rich so the money she left me to him was like... What did he say ""don't get too excited it's only 65'000$ so it's not going to change your life."" Haha he's disconnected from my reality clearly.

Anyway, the money went into a freshly opened bank account and clears on the 30th. I believe in my case I might have gotten an irresponsible narcissist because she took so much that I have nothing to lose anymore. She can't take my kids, I could barely work this year and made maybe 60k, so there's no money, inheritance is covered by law, she has her own car and I have my 2. Yeah, I think I'll just take the couch I've slept on for 7 years even though I'm really excited to get a bed.

Here's the conclusion. When her and I first crossed paths I was captaining a beautiful vessel full of beautiful people to places we'd never been together. Invited her along for the ride and slowly, my vessel rusted out, my crew all abandoned me and the tropical paradise I was destined for is just a deserted island with no people, no art and no escape. And maybe after all this I truly am a shitty person, fine, it's not like I don't know I'm broken but that's the hardest part. Humpty Dumpty didn't have to try and decide what parts of him were broken from the fall and which ones were broken prior to.

Anyway, I'm paying for a year lease in a lump sum and slowly going to get to know myself.

**Prompt:**

Use the woman in the reference image to create a high quality selfie picture.

In this high-angle selfie, the woman is captured in the cozy, warm atmosphere of a sunlit European-style cafe. She is seated at a light wooden table positioned next to a large window that overlooks a bustling city street with blurred pedestrians and historic architecture. The windowsill is decorated with a row of books and small potted plants, including a cactus and orange flowers, while a half-eaten croissant and a cup of cappuccino sit on the table in front of her, adding to the lived-in, morning aesthetic.

The woman’s pose is intimate and engaging, leaning slightly forward toward the camera with a gentle, warm smile. She holds the camera with her left hand, which is visible in the foreground, creating the classic perspective of a handheld selfie. Her body is relaxed, and she is angled toward the light, which highlights her facial features and creates a soft glow against the indoor setting.

Her hair color is the same as the reference image, is styled in a voluminous, casual high bun at the top of her head. Soft, wavy strands are intentionally left loose to frame her face, giving her an effortless and cozy appearance that matches the cafe environment.

Her outfit consists of an oversized, cream-colored ribbed knit sweater with a wide boat neckline that rests softly across her shoulders. The thick, textured fabric of the sweater suggests a cool morning or a comfortable indoor temperature. The light, neutral tone of the garment complements the warm wooden tones of the cafe and the soft morning light.

The camera is held at a high angle, looking down at the subject from a close distance. This positioning emphasizes her face and the top-down view of the breakfast on the table, while the wide-angle lens captures the depth of the cafe and the street scene outside. The focus is sharp on the woman, while the background remains softly blurred in a shallow depth of field.

I also have strong behaviorals, though I am not diverse.

Problem is I have a 3.6 GPA, with lower grades (Bs) in my economics classes. From my target school and strong experience background, what GPA do I need for

1. Bulge bracket (e.g., Goldman/MS)
2. Elite boutique (e.g., Qatalyst, Centerview, PJT)
3. Elite private equity (e.g., Blackstone, KKR, Bain)
4. Consulting (MBB) — my backup plan

For these categories, assume I have coffee chatted 2-5 people per firm (and realistically will receive 1-2 referrals).

Please let me know if my GPA will hold me back! Also, after I have made it through the hirevue screen and get to talk with a real person, does my GPA matter anymore?

Thanks so much!

I was away for two weeks, and I suspect that coffee residue has dried and hardened somewhere in the final outlet section - after the capsule has been pierced and hot water has passed through it, but before the coffee reaches the mug.

Water is definitely getting into the capsule, because only a small amount of coffee ends up in the mug while most of it appears to be diverted into the used-capsule bin. I’ve already tried descaling and fully emptying/cleaning the machine, but the issue persists.

If I need to replace the machine, so be it - but it fits my setup perfectly. If there’s a way to fix this without fully dismantling it or paying more than the machine is worth (not much at this point), I’d like to try.

1pxw46p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pxw46p/im_being_stalked_by_a_wax_cult/,i'm being stalked by a wax cult.,"I'm very new to Reddit, like 4 hours new. And well, and truly, I just need someone to listen to me. Yet, I didn't think I'd be so pressured to post here of all places, so soon. But, as I sit in my room, it hangs over me currently. The tormenting factor of my life.

Now, I don't have time to make this neat, but as I'm here, I'll write it as it happened.

At first, I thought they were statues. Maybe some new animatronic people became fans of, the new and cool fad. Whatever, that's Vienna. More money than you can know what to do with it, hah.

Strangely though, they did nothing. Nobody else could see them, so I thought I was going crazy, hallucinating. And, as an art major, they were useful. For all it was, having a personal piece of anatomy I could see and encapsulate basically gave me a cheat sheet that followed everywhere I went.

Anyways, I'm dragging on with conceptual sounding words, I do that sometimes.

So, around a year ago, these strange, melted looking people seemed to pop up everywhere. After I'd transferred to Austrian art school from engineering in Bremen. (yes I'm German, yes i got accepted to art school, I am nothing like that though so please refrain from saying anything on the matter). Moved here 2 years ago, and everything was fine. I was pursuing my dreams, becoming an artist, becoming one of the greats.

So, sorry, back to what happened. A year ago, these waxy women started appearing in every room. Yet, they were deformed. Physically. You know what a molten candle looks like, right? The little drops of wax than drip down the side of the candle's structure. Yeah, the souls legs looked like those, yet, still liquid, kind of. You know that state where the outside of the wax is solid, but the liquid inside can still change the shape of the wax? The dripping effect was applied to the women's legs, their arms melted off to the elbow.

The women's stubby arms would be connected to the molten legs. Well, I wouldn't call them legs- rather they looked like a blob of hardening candle wax, but still!- That's besides the point, they looked wrong.

I'd see them in every room, but nobody acknowledged them. Maybe I was crazy, but I never bothered to interact with them. They looked... eerie. And something told me I shouldn't. Maybe some primal instinct, the last part of me that told me to keep my distance, something bad. And to this day, I know I should listen to my last bounds.

They've never tried interacting with me, though. All they ever did was twisted into specific positions I needed when drawing female anatomy. Like they read my mind. Quite useful, I might say.

Again, my apologies for my droning on and on, but this has been my life for the past few months. Waking up to seeing the waxy women somewhere in my room, in a corner when I walk out of my bedroom, everywhere.

And that brings me to 3 days ago. I was hanging out with my good friend Henry, the melting woman here today sat just a little closer than normal. Sure, she was still just in my peripheral, but she would've been the next table over. It's a little distracting, sure, there's basically a melting mannequin next to you with falling out, wet hair and no eyes with white skin that looks like something you'd set on fire to release pleasant smells, but I've grown accustom to it.

This day, in the chilly autumn Viennese café we were seated at, Henry looked distraught. Panicked more than he usually would. I think it's important that you know my best friend is a good artist. A very good artist, and although you may think I'm exaggerating, but he may be better than Monet, Da Vinci and if he chose to, could out-Picasso Picasso himself. A creative mind, unlike any other person I've ever met.

Truthfully, I look up to him a lot, he truly is should be one of the greats. Anyway, enough of the 'glaze', as we apparently call in nowadays. As we talked, I saw him specifically averting his gaze from the right side of our table, and his cheeks slightly flushed. Not that I expected it to be the molten soul next to us, of course. Nobody else knew about them other than me, it was just me.

After we finished our chatter- which was around 3 hours, with several times coffee and cakes were ordered- Henry and I finished talking. As we stood up to leave though, Henry walked over to the thing I believed to be a figment of my imagination, and grabbed some of it's more molten wax. The piece grimaced, recoiling from his touch as it started bleeding clear, hot wax. I stood there, appalled. Could he see them to? Could everybody? Had I just witnessed a murder? My best friend looked back at me, with a slightly solemn look, and put a finger to his lips, shushing me.  
""I have a sketchbook I'll give you tomorrow in Human Biology. Don't be late, ok?""  
I nodded, and instinctively took a step back from the wax mess on the floor. The two of us walked out of the cafe quietly, and, nobody seemed to question the drained wax corpse that sat inside that Henry had just killed. Normally we'd've held hands on a walk home like that, but we didn't.

That should've been my first red flag. Yet, as the clueless, naive, little German boy I am at heart, I didn't notice. When I walked into my dorm, I saw the local wax figure, and did nothing. I studied Da Vinci's manuscripts on anatomy, like a normal person, ate dinner, sketched some clothing designs, before I prepped for bed, and went to sleep.

The next morning, I went to class, although I wasn't refreshed. I hadn't slept at all, the seen of my friend ever so violently ripping a chunk of flesh- no, wax from the wax woman. I cast a look to the wax woman next to my doorway, slightly closer than usual, but whatever. Maybe they trusted me more now that I hadn't tried to kill them. I went off to my school, not the art school, but university. First class was Human Bio, Henry would give me the sketch book. Yet, as I walked into class, I didn't see him. Not in our usual front and center. He was usually punctual, but hey, I could dismiss it. Just as always.

During the time I was meant to have my study break for the day, I decided to go visit Henry at his home. Sure, he hadn't texted me that he was sick or anything, as he would've, but I had to check on him. Maybe he felt bad for yesterday's murder. Whatever, it's not my job to come up with a reason why he decided to skip a class.

As I arrived at the apartment block he lived at, I felt a chill run down my spine. Another wax corpse, clear, hot wax gushing out from where the stubs of it's arm would've been. Had he massacred more?

When I went up to his level, I walked over to his door. Something told me to stop. Anhalt. The small spirit of common sense I had left in me told me something was wrong. Whether it was a test of whether I'd betray my friend's privacy, or maybe something that told me he was murdering spirits, I ignored it. And oh how wrong I was for that.

As I stepped inside, at first I didn't understand what I'd seen. 5 big, white candles, lit up in a circle surrounding a perspiring Henry. He seemed to be in concentration- then, oh god. Oh goodness, the room was littered with the husks of the wax women. Drained of waxy, warm, liquid insides. Cold. Really, quite the sight. But as you can tell, this is not the end so far. As I looked back at Henry, I saw his brown hair, on the floor. Clumps fraying out by the second, his chest seemed to sag with something. Hips wider, his legs were connected to the floor, like he was molten down. He seemed more feminine, and then I realized, I couldn't see his eyes anymore. Hell, I couldn't see his eyelids, it was like skin had just enveloped them. His skin was white, waxy and see through.

As I'm sure you could put together a lot faster than I had, Henry was turning into one of the damn women. A man, turning into a woman- now I'm not transphobic, but when your best friend is a man killing people who currently look like him just yesterday, it can be quite alarming. I saw his sketchbook on the counter, ran over, and grabbed it. I felt the wax corpses gazes, although they were dead, trying to tell me to do something. Anything. I grabbed the book, and ran out of the room. And the last thing I heard before I remember finding myself in my dorm again,  
""Run."".  
Possibly the last word I'd ever hear from my best friend ever again.

When I came back to my senses, I felt overwhelmed by information. I was in my bed, surrounded by pages of notes written in Henry's elaborate -and unreadable- cursive. Words spun around my head, talking about how talented artists always went missing over the past 400 years. All artists that were going well in their careers, hundreds- no, thousands of them. then, Da Vinci's notes. And Monet's, Michelangelo's, and strangely, Hitler's. All mentioning seeing waxy, female women with distorted, melted features their entire lives. Sure, it differed for each artist, Monet said he'd see them whenever he went out in public, whilst Da Vinci said he saw them in any corner he looked. Then Henry's, seeing them in every room.

They scaled to how good the artist was. That's what I realized. And the last one- Adolf's. I dreaded to read it, because well, he's evil. Probably worse than these wax women. I read it in a terrible scrawl a mess. Then, the date. April 30th, 1945. A slight splatter of a dark, oxidised thing I could only recognise as blood from Human Bio. He said he's seen the monstrous, distorted creatures as a child, until he was rejected. And there was one in the bunker, he couldn't take it, apparently.  
Then, I saw it in the corner of the room. The usually blank faced wax woman's face was contorted into a smile. The gut wrenching truth.

That was a fellow artist. This plague- it had taken my best friend. The woman's stringy, black hair hung over her face. It reminded me of a movie. Except, it was only if I touched them, right? With that, I pulled the blankets over me, hugging the sketchbook. Until I read the top sentence on the paper.

I am very soon going to Colombia. It is going to be amazing no matter what I choose, but I am trying to sketch out my itinerary.

The choice now is between spending five days in the Salento/Cocora valley area, then flying to Santa Marta for the Ciudad perdida (4 day) trek, and then having two days of wind down and exploration in Tayrona, OR spending just three days in the first area, while having four days in the Tayrona. 

The first option would allow for some exploration of the Los Nevados national park, ample time for a coffee tour and a relaxed pace. The second option would leave more time for exploration of Tayrona, possibly a visit to Minca.

1pxw1f3,https://i.redd.it/ru5vlwus5z9g1.jpeg,Who knew picking out ducks at Walmart could be such a loving experience?,"We stopped at Walmart a couple nights ago, for coffee and windshield wiper fluid. On our way to check out I saw an employee putting out the Valentine’s Day products. I excitedly explained to him that for each holiday Walmart sells these different themed ducks, and they’re the cutest things ever. He let me lead the way as I looked through the aisles before stumbling upon a fresh box of ducks! Success!

Now came the hard part— choosing a duck. I pulled out every cow duck in the box, lined them up in a row, and started noting all the differences and eliminating the ones that weren’t THE duck for me. I got down to 3 and started explaining what I liked about this one or disliked about that one. I finally decided on one with a heart over his eye, like a little eye patch. With my new friend selected, I turned my sights towards the strawberry ducks. 

“Should I get a strawberry duck too? They’re so cute and only $3!”

“Get the strawberry duck too. I’ll get them both for you.”

Overall the keto scene keeps getting steadily more crazy, more violent and more psychotic as they are increasingly groomed solely by conspiracy theories in echo chambers. Three things in particular have defined keto year 2025.

# KETO-CTA study & its coverup attempt

[KETO-CTA was a highly notable study because it clearly and concretely demonstrated that people on a keto diet develop arterial plaque at an alarmingly high rate.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772963X25001036) It looked directly at the arteries of otherwise healthy people with a CTA scanner, which is very important, because the ketoduped have been brainwashed to ignore talk about risk factors. Now they have as concrete evidence as possible that yes, it really does clog up arteries. This proves it to them.

What was much more interesting was [the coverup attempt of that result, which was promptly caught by honest researchers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDr4iFqENgc). In a nutshell, the original declared primary result – what the study was supposed to look at – was exactly that: to look into plaque buildup in a select population of healthy individuals doing a keto diet. However, the primary authors of the research paper – Dave Feldman, Matthew Budoff, Nick Norwitz and Adrian Soto-Moto – [did not discuss or even show numbers of the primary result anywhere in the paper.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12163138/)

The only way that real researchers noticed the rapid plaque buildup was by carefully looking at one graph. It was otherwise sidestepped with not even numbers presented in text, and [the graph itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoduped/comments/1jytcm2/when_study_results_dont_support_your_desired/) was made such that the dramatic plaque increase was hard to see.

Dave Feldman and Nick Norwitz are known keto cranks who have been pushing the keto scam for years from cholesterol denialist angle. Even after getting caught, Dave & Nick have been spinning their own narrative where they basically [tell their audience an opposite story of what the study really showed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=546N08qzQgs). Matthew Budoff simply lied in Gil's interview that the paper was preliminary when pressed about missing data. It was not.

As Dr. Gil Cavalho put it, those people have no regard for human life. None.

The silver lining: KETO-CTA is invaluable because now it can be demonstrated with only one paper that keto kills you, and the people pushing keto deceive you about it.

# Brian “Liver King” Johnson dropped carnivore diet

Yet another high profile carnivore influencer supplement salesman [dropped the carnivore diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoduped/comments/1mun6v9/liver_king_is_no_longer_carnivore/), joining the [likes of Paul Saladino](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoduped/comments/1cm329a/paul_saladino_re_ounces_keto) (who still has no issues with his conscience keeping [his book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/035846997X/?bestFormat=true&k=carnivore%20diet%20paul%20saladino) with the advice that caused all his health problem on sale).

Also worth remembering is Liver King denied using steroids for years to sell his supplements but [got exposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKpmAGZQetc) a few years back. Turned out he was injecting roids for about $10,000 worth every month.

[He also went completely crazy in some sort of psychotic breakdown.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Dlsj_BQc0) When the police stepped in and he was being arrested, we got an unfiltered glimpse into the reality of carnivore, as he was desperately pleading the police to at least be at least allowed to take a dump. He was doing coffee enemas, that is, shooting coffee up his ass, to be able to poop.

As an isolated incident this would be relatively minor happening, but you know who else got a psychotic mental breakdown on a carnivore diet? [Jordan Peterson](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoduped/comments/1e0b5cb/yes_carnivore_diet_drove_jordan_peterson_into/). One is a curiosity, two is getting interesting, especially since both are top carnivore influencers.

# RFK Jr took over United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Robert Francis Kennedy Junior ended up as the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. And what does HHS, and by extension him, have control over? Most notably in context of diet and food supply, he now controls Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).

We know he is a nepobaby, [a worm ate some of his brain](https://archive.ph/FG8Yr), has no science education, believes meat and saturated fat are healthy, believes vegetable oils are evil, believes raw milk is harmless, and eats some sort high satfat paleo. He certainly looks the part with that trademark inflamed red lobster face. He also [gets his testosterone from a syringe](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12275891/Antivaxxer-RFK-Jnr-admits-using-TRT-dubbed-legal-steroids.html).

He has known connections with several keto crowd aligned influencers: supplement salesman Paul Saladino, supplement salesman Calley Means, lobbyist Nina Teicholz, ""biohacking"" clinicist Aseem Malhotra, supplement saleswoman Vani Hari, and rancher Joel Salatin. All of them are saturated fat pushers. And did you know the FDA controls supplement safety regulations? Just saying.

2025 did not see anything drastic on dietary front from HHS as [RFK Jr was focusing on purging Center of Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/rfk-jr-hhs-oust-entire-roster-cdc-vaccine-expert-committee) of immunologists and replacing them with antivaxx sycophants, most notably when [he simply fired the head of CDC Dr. Susan Monarez when Dr. Monarez refused to sign vaccine restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-.html).

[The new Dietary Guidelines for Americans are coming soon](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-dietary-guidelines-delayed-until-early-2026-2025-12-05/), and RJK Jr has some control over those. From his circle of close influencers, particularly [Nina Teicholz has been lobbying hard for more saturated fat ](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/28/rfk-jr-hhs-american-diet-00195876)in the upcoming guidelines.[ FDA’s Marty Makary has strongly hinted there will be no restrictions on saturated fat.](https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1962895599835009184) The guidelines however are a joint effort between HHS and USDA, and in principle must be based on scientific evidence. Robert & Marky are not able to dictate it but who knows what will happen considering the current [USDA head Brooke Rollins is strongly aligned](https://www.nationalbeefwire.com/health-human-services-and-usda-hold-first-public-maha-event) with their views. She comes from a rancher family.

If junior & the gang manage to tamper with the guidelines, it presents a funny dilemma to the keto crowd. Consider the following: they have been throughoutly brainwashed to distrust all health authorities to such extent they deliberately do the exact opposite, then suddenly health authorities are telling them to eat more fat. :D

# Where are the people under 40?

To end the year on a positive note, the keto scence continues to be dominated by boomers and gen z. There are no notable millennial or zoomer influencers. Nick Norwitz is the only exception I can think of and he managed to delete his own credibility already. The near complete absence of those generations continues to get louder as years go by.

Could the vasoconstricting effects of the coffee be making things easier for me?

and 2) if youve ever called customer service or watched netflix or worked with salesforce you've used a data center which produces just as much waste as any AI shit 

and 3) constantly calling out stuff as AI harms real artists as real people constantly get accused of their real artwork being AI and disproportionately impacts marginalized artists

and 4) copyright laws are inherently stupid anyway, if you really are anti-capitalist then you need to be against copyright BS as well. all monetary value is made up. copying information is not stealing it. 

and 5) plagiarism is obviously a separate issue but identifying pics as AI is not plagiarism. plagiarism means saying something produced is your work when it isnt. 

and 6) i literally do not believe in money. everything should be free because money should not exist. no one is saying ""you personally deserve to starve."" i reject the premise that anyone should tie their survival to money, period.

and 7) ai obviously has its issues but there are ways of using it responsibly and with awareness. as a schizoid i gain more value out of using ai to journal than i do out of interacting with the many real human therapists who have caused me extensive harm

and 8) we have the studies and the data that prove that ai facilitated therapy offers benefits when the patient has extreme trauma as ai is less judgmental and cannot be harmed by hearing aversive details of trauma",0,1766940540.0,ChatGPT,24,0.39,False

My acne started when I was around 13, and I’m 18 now. And honestly, I know a lot of people in this sub cant afford to see a dermatologist for acne, so we end up doing what we can trying products, avoiding products, overthinking everything. Same.

I never really believed in the whole gut-skin connection thing at first. Sounded a bit impossible cause i was pretty sure my gut wasnt the problem. But when my acne got worse and I was desperate, I started noticing some very specific patterns.

First big trigger: eggs
I know many people won’t believe this I didnt either, but every single time I ate eggs, I’d get a big, painful pimple literally the same day or the next day. Not small ones. Deep, angry ones.
Then I noticed coffee absolutely does not suit me.
Same with dates and dry fruits in general  breakouts every time.

Heres the interesting part: all of these have one thing in common.
In south asian culture, people say these foods have “garam taseer” (heat-producing nature). Dates, coffee, eggs, chai all considered ""hot"" they all make me breakout to this day.

Someone casually told me, “girl, if youre too hot-blooded, start eating cooling foods.”
That sent me down a rabbit hole and I ended up buying basil seeds (tukmalanga).

And guys…the results were actually insane.
Within one month, my face cleared up a LOT. I wont say I never get pimples now  I still get 2-3 a month but compared to before, it’s nothing. I’m genuinely grateful (Alhamdulillah).
Now I sometimes wonder:
Was it really about the taseer of foods?
Or was it the fiber in basil seeds quietly fixing something in my gut?
I never had obvious digestive issues, but maybe something was still off and the fiber helped anyway.
Not saying this will work for everyone. Not giving medical advice. Just sharing my experience for anyone who feels stuck, broke, and tired of trying everything.

If nothing else, maybe it gives someone a new angle to think about. ",8,1766940500.0,PakistaniSkincare,15,1.0,False

My world is over.,"I don’t even know why I’m typing this. Maybe because the pain in my chest feels like it will crack my ribs, and I have nowhere else to scream. I’m Max. 43 years old. My wife, Sarah, is cheating on me. Writing that sentence feels like describing a heart attack in clinical terms—it doesn’t come close to the reality of dying inside.

Sarah and I are the cliché. High school sweethearts. We met at 16, junior year, in Mr. Henderson’s chemistry class. She was the smart, fiery redhead who argued with him about the Bunsen burner setup. I was the quiet guy who finally spoke up to back her point. Our first kiss was behind the bleachers after a football game. She was my first everything. We did the long-distance thing through college (different schools, but same state), survived a rough patch when I took a semester abroad, and came out the other side more sure than ever.

I proposed on her 22nd birthday. We got married at 23 and 22. Everyone said we were too young, that we hadn’t “lived.” But we were a unit. “Max and Sarah against the world.” We built a life: I’m a structural engineer, she’s a marketing director. We bought a house. We got two amazing rescue dogs. Kids weren’t in the cards for us—a few painful years of trying and failed fertility treatments led us to accept that our love and our life together would be our legacy. We traveled, built a friend group, weathered the loss of parents. We were the couple people pointed to and said, “They made it.”

And now… now I’m sitting in our home office, in the chair she picked out, and I want to burn it all down.

The shift was subtle, maybe starting 6 months ago. A distance. More “late work nights” for a “big new client.” Her phone, always left casually on the coffee table, became a permanent appendage, screen always face-down. She’d take calls in the garden. The easy, physical warmth she’d always shown—a hand on my back as she passed, curling into me on the couch—became rare, stiff. I chalked it up to stress, to midlife fatigue. I suggested couples counseling, a vacation. She’d sigh, “I’m just tired, Max. It’s not us. Work is insane.”

The gut punch came last Thursday. Her phone buzzed on the kitchen counter as she was showering. A Signal notification lit up the screen: Tom: “Counting the hours until Friday. This week has been torture without seeing you.”

My blood turned to ice. I knew the passcode—the birthday of our first dog, passed away three years ago. My hands shook so badly I mis-typed it twice. I opened Signal. There it was. A thread with “Tom.” Her client. 50s, divorced. The affair had been going on for four months. The messages weren’t just sexual (though they were graphically, devastatingly so). They were intimate. She told him things about our marriage—my insecurities, our struggles with infertility—twisting them into jokes or reasons why she was “unfulfilled.” She sent him photos she hadn’t sent me in years. They made plans, called each other pet names (“Captain” and “Kitten,” which made me vomit). They had a hotel booked for this coming Friday afternoon.

I felt the floor drop away. The 27-year narrative of my life—our love story—rewrote itself in an instant into something pathetic and false. I sat there, listening to the shower run, and dissociated.

I haven’t confronted her. I’m a coward. Because I don’t know who I am without her. My entire adult identity is “Sarah’s husband.” I feel like a ghost. I pretended to have a work emergency and am now in a crappy airport hotel, writing this.

Tried migraine meds, no relief, I've had two rounds of botox, 2nd round did provide 7 days of relief, (side note, after a little digging botox has been used to treat csf leak symtpoms). Neurologist provided a referral to Mayo, stating there are no facilities locally that can run the required tests.  The fun part is it's out of network and I have to pay out of pocket.  

I'm at a point where my business is failing, my default is anger, I hyper focus on faults, not the man my wife married and at a point where I just have to sit and wait to see if they can find a leak.  Can't get into Mayo until February 2026, and the only things I can do to reduce the pain is laying down and drinking coffee. 

This whole experience has been demoralizing.  There's no physical symptoms others can see, except my wife seeing me black out, tears in my eyes from the pain, stumbling, running into walls, and just standing staring confused because I can't remeber what I was doing.  

Very few friends know, and I have no desire to reach out adding to the problems they already have in their lives.  

I'm becoming more isolated, because if anyone other than my wife asks how I'm doing, its always ""doing ok, and you?"" I know my wife is more than likely worn out, because all she hears is me complaing, and I don't contribute as much around the house as I used to. 

I find no joy in anything, I have no interest in music anymore, I have to force myself to do any project or task, and even when completed there's no satisfaction.  Constant earinging, and starting to get sound and light sensitivity.

This is just a long rant, and I realize this is a waiting game, and very expensive.

1pxvqif,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pxvqif/evil_and_necessary/,Evil and Necessary,"I am nothing special—well, I *was* nothing special. This could have happened to anyone; it just happened to me. And if it does happen to one of you, I'll be the first to pity you and say I'm so sorry.

I wish I could just explain it to you, but first, I need you to understand a concept—one that you are inherently born with to the point you barely even notice it. There isn't just good and evil; there is a broad spectrum that lies within, determining most of the decisions you'll make at work, at home, and with your family. If you call someone a name, that is seen as mean. Bully the scrawny kid who seems like an easy target? Well, that's obviously bad. Murder, along with other deplorable acts humanity commits consciously, is usually where evil lies—but not always.

I grew up with a relatively normal family, normal values, alcoholic dad. I had two siblings, and while at one point my brother and I were close, once he went to college he became more distant. My sister and I have always had a relationship akin to the one you have with a nice co-worker. You may go out a few times and spend time together, but in the end, you barely know anything about each other beyond surface-level experiences. I had friends in school, but due to my dad's constantly changing job predicament, I was always moving from place to place, state to state. It was hard to keep friends and even harder to make new ones, but I was lucky to hold on to one of them, who I will call [Buddy](). She isn't relevant to my story, but I just wanted you to know that I could have turned to someone before doing the things that I did.

After high school and failed college attempts, I ended up joining the military. While my time in was less than stellar, it taught me an important concept: ORM, which stands for Operational Risk Management. Basically, before you make a decision, you assess the possible risk versus the outcome. If the risk is high, find ways to mitigate the risks to a manageable level. During my last deployment is where I also believe I either awakened or contracted this sickness that plagues my life.

It was a deployment to [Kuwait]()—nothing special other than this time, instead of guarding ships or boats, we actually had a high-value asset to guide to a certain part of a nearby city. I remember the sun setting and seeing the beauty of [Kuwait City]() with its impossible architecture replacing the sun with its broad spotted glow. If the city was salvation, then our mission led us to damnation. A city that I can't find, nor do I know the name since I was only a passenger with no clue where we were going. The signs were in Arabic, and like many service members, I did not ask questions because I'm not paid to do so. My team was told to load up and that a blue SUV with a red symbol was our assigned vehicle. After packing some rations and two spare mags for my [M4]() and my shitty [M18](), I made my way to find the vehicle first just so I could get shotgun, recline the seat, and sleep away most of what was supposed to be an uneventful last deployment. Once I found a blue SUV, I surveyed it for the red symbol. Eventually, I spotted it in the oddest of places—it was on the roof and no bigger than the size of my hand. It looked as if someone had drawn a star, put dots in a triangle pattern inside of it, then cut it in half. I had never seen anything like it before, but tiredness took over rational thought, and all I could think of was that I was wasting precious slumber time looking at a doodle. I climbed into the front passenger seat, unclipped my M4, laid back, and waited for my team who was no doubt going to be pissed at me for missing the rest of the brief in order to sleep.

After about an hour of traversing dark and uneventful roads, we made it to a place that possessed the essence of a lost town you would find in the deserts of [Arizona](). There were few buildings, most abandoned, and others looked barely occupied—even if occupied by animals. The roads were cracked horribly, as if a monstrosity had stomped its way through the city like taking a midnight stroll. The only sign of human life was an obvious dull light emitting from a tent outside what looked to be a shaft that went underground. I asked my squad lead if that was it, but he immediately cut me off before saying, ""Zip it. You would have known this was it if you didn't fuck off from the brief to dream about the ladyboys in [Thailand](), shitbag."" Me being the smart ass I was, replied, ""Well chief, life is not worth living if you're not sword fighting with a handful of titties."" While crewman and engineman laughed, chief choked on his coffee, obviously caught off guard by my vulgar rebuttal. He opened the door of the SUV and before telling everyone to shut up and get out, and to follow his lead.

Once I geared up and shut the door, I realized how quiet it was. It was like the wind was even afraid to howl in this part of the earth. All I heard was our footsteps going towards the tent with a dull ringing in my ears from past more hectic deployments—ones that definitely boosted my disability claim. Once we walked up close to the tent, I was surprised to not hear anything but what sounded like a hum of an old computer mixed with a heartbeat rhythm. It was muffled, not like the sound you would hear from a speaker in a closed room, but the sound you hear when your phone buzzes in your pocket. Chief mumbled to himself, irritated that whoever was supposed to be standing watch had obviously abandoned his post without being relieved. As I approached where the watch stander usually is posted, I noticed the boot marks of where he was standing, and that the only path led into the tent. Being tired and the idiot I was, I walked to open the tent ready to crack a joke on the watch stander about how it wasn't that cold outside, and how they were scared of the dark or something. I wanted to be funny and make our night less grueling. I should have done a lot of things instead of being a comedian. I should have followed orders, I should have followed chief's lead, I should have noticed the spent casings littered towards the entrance of the tent. I should have listened to the yell of my chief that almost sounded more like panic than anger when I pulled the flap open.

Evil is not always as simple as just a very foul deed, because sometimes, if not most times, people justify them by claiming it is necessary. If a murderer is sentenced to death, it is seen as a necessary punishment more than it is evil. Now, if that same murderer only killed someone who did a vile and cruel act, who frankly deserved death more than the murderer did, but is still sentenced to death, is justice really served? Who punishes the government for carrying out an evil deed to correct someone else's evil deed? My point being that it is a perspective that is usually decided for us through our justice system, and so it takes the questioning act out of what's moral in our decision making. But in a lawless land like this, how can I know if I am just in my actions when no one is left to question them?

Once the flap no longer obscured my view, I saw the watch stander standing over what was supposed to be chief's point of contact. He probably was someone important before, but now he was just a man who looked to be in his 70s wearing a bomber jacket and dust-covered jeans. The watch stander, pale and shaking, realizing how he must look, immediately dropped his weapon and cried, ""It was in him!! I was told if it got in him to..."" Before he could finish, I heard an all-too-familiar pop of a trigger freshly squeezed. The watch stander quickly succumbed to gravity as his body no longer had the will to stand, no longer possessed a soul. I looked over to see chief who urgently looked down before tracing the ground to me and raising the barrel to me. I must have been sweaty and sticky from the heat of the past day, because when I raised my barrel I almost felt a pull against my clothing, but I was more focused on not meeting a similar death to chief's recent victim. I raised my barrel just high enough to send a round into his knee, buckling him enough to throw off his aim. I was struck three times in my vest before I sent a round into his pelvis then throat. I had never been shot before, and never witnessed the carnage of a gunfight this up close. The gunfire had attracted the attention of my squad who was more than likely still doing post-trip inspections on the vehicle and now was double-timing it to me and chief.

I don't know what happened or exactly how to explain it, but my thoughts changed. They were no longer mine. My morals had been reset to the basics; no longer did I hold the belief that most do in my home country where a higher-ranking being would decide for me what's good and bad. In that moment, I comprehended three things: Chief shot an unarmed man, and was going to shoot me, so I shot him. And regardless of how I told this story to anyone, explaining I was just defending myself, without the evidence to prove my innocence I would be jailed and locked away for God knows how long. I corrected an evil, not committed an evil act. It made sense to me then, even when I dispatched the two men who I spent most of my deployment joking with and known for years before that. I did it without hesitation, no malice or sympathy. Just accuracy and determination.

Once the smoke settled and the night returned to quiet, it was as if my thoughts were returned to me. I felt the weight of what I had done, the overwhelming guilt plaguing me and spreading across my body. I felt hot with sorrow and rage, so hot that I elected to take off my vest and gear and slumped to the ground and took note of the mess I had made. It wasn't until I looked down and saw a red glow coming from my chest that I noticed the ringing that I came to know most of my career was completely absent. The tugging of my clothes that I felt when firing on my chief was not from my clothes, but within my own skin.

Something within me writhed and adjusted itself like a tenant making themselves at home. I wish I could tell you that I knew what possessed me, but in a state of complete mental blackness, I simply got back into the SUV and drove away.

Weeks passed of me wandering East Asia, and I noticed that not only were my senses heightened, but my decision-making was amplified. Decisions that would take mere seconds were now made in fractions of a second. The calculations were completed in my head and justified in a moment's notice. But the decisions weren't mine; it was like someone else entirely made my decisions for me, and all I did was take orders. I would take crimes into my own hands, even though I held no interest in doing so and just wanted a normal life. If I was to witness a vile act, I would correct it. It depresses me and makes me feel hopeless, even when the locals call me a hero for killing bad people. The thing inside me may make the decisions to carry out the actions, but it bears no weight of snuffing the light out of people's eyes. It does not care that I don't agree with some of the punishments it makes me serve to people before returning my weapon of a body to me to hold the guilt.

You might think having abilities to be an efficient killer and the apex predator sounds like a gift more than a curse, but imagine not seeing your family anymore, those petty arguments you have with your siblings. That time you took for granted—the last few days you spent with your best friend—not knowing that would be the last time you see them. When the most exciting thing in your life was riding a subway in New York City. Even if I could return to a normal life, I still claimed so many souls that I would never sleep. With each kill, a black inky mark that looks similar to the red symbol on that SUV appears on my arms in different forms of odd stars and dotted triangles. They almost cover me, and I become more numb to the deeds.

I do not make this post as a cry for help, but as a warning. Please do not take your free will for granted, like I once did. Cherish the moments with your friends and family, and be grateful to not bear the wretched curse I do. And last but most importantly, take care in deciding your actions from now on, because if I am a witness, I cannot control what your punishment will be.",1,1766939946.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The person in question is called ""Javiera."" We were classmates in high school in 10th grade (we were about 14-15 years old) and she always seemed like a really cute and fun person to me from the moment I first saw her. We were never super close when we were studying, but we always had a really good relationship the times we talked. During high school, I was a very different person than I am today. Before, I was the unbearable kid who said a ton of huge stupid things, and now I can consider myself a very low-key and chill person, but without being an introvert. She, on the other hand, is currently a very interesting girl. She works as a model for a few Chilean brands and appears in some videos of well-known artists. She's the type of person you'd think is very serious, but from what I know of her, she's someone who's very fun and approachable.

The times we've gone out have been really good, in my opinion. We've gone to take photos, I've gone to have coffee with another friend in between, we've played Minecraft, and we even went out at night with my best friend and his partner (this last thing was last night). While all these plans don't suggest that she has any kind of interest in me, maybe I'm the one who has changed my feelings towards her. I realized this yesterday when I walked her home at 2:30 in the morning (I wasn't going to let her go alone, especially with alcohol in her system), but maybe that concern for her well-being made me realize that maybe I like her.

We share some common interests like fashion, the type of humor, a liking for photography, and our personalities are compatible, in my opinion.

Honestly, she's a really cute person, and I don't think I'm ugly at all, but I have that fear of ruining a good friendship just out of selfishness (?).

[“USS George Washington sliding into history — launched June 9, 1959, she would become the first ballistic missile submarine, turning naval warfare on its head.” ](https://preview.redd.it/rsqtcufpzy9g1.jpg?width=1626&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51be2df81b66ed283bc1a17f3ab4fc72340b238c)



This week — December 27 — lands right in the middle of a pivotal stretch in submarine history. Just days before USS George Washington (SSBN-598) was officially commissioned on December 30, 1959, the Navy was standing on the edge of something no one had ever pulled off before: a true, survivable undersea nuclear deterrent.

By the close of that year, George Washington had already been transformed — quietly and deliberately — from an attack submarine into the world’s first ballistic missile boat. No parades. No press tours. Just a radical conversion happening fast, behind the fence line, while the Cold War was heating up and the oceans were becoming the real high [ground.So](http://ground.So) it’s worth telling the story now — because before drones, before GPS, and long before anyone carried nuclear codes in their pockets, the U.S. Navy was busy building something fierce: a machine designed to live underwater, fight underwater, and stay hidden underwater, while forcing Soviet admirals to do math at night they didn’t like the answers to.

[“Historic moment: On July 20, 1960, USS George Washington \(SSBN-598\) launched the first Polaris A-1 missile while submerged — a defining Cold War milestone in nuclear deterrence — with Rear Admiral William F. ‘Red’ Raborn Jr., head of the Polaris submarine development program, on board as an observer for this groundbreaking test.”](https://preview.redd.it/w9i9ssmszy9g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02cf6a5a0446022dd263f00225cd4932a94497ba)

She wasn’t built for sightseeing or ceremony. She was built around three ideas that still matter today: speed, silence, and violence if required. 😎🌊

She was supposed to be named: USS Scorpion (SSN-589) 🦂 — part of a revolutionary new class shaped by the lessons of Albacore. No flat decks. No WWII-style compromises. Sleek teardrop hull. Underwater performance that turned fish jealous. She was meant to be the fastest silent killer ever unleashed under the ocean. If the Cold War ever went hot, this boat was the nightmare waiting in the dark. 🐟💥

[Successful First Launch](https://preview.redd.it/grmou11wzy9g1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f5587c7a9caa43ed330d5fb8cb41062bff05ba8)

Meanwhile, the Cold War was getting hotter than a July barbecue in Georgia. Nukes were multiplying, politicians were sweating, and the Pentagon looked like a pot of chili about to boil over. And right in the middle of it all strutted the U.S. Air Force, walking around like the only adult in the nuclear conversation. They basically told everyone, “Relax, America. We’ve got the bombers. We’ve got the rockets. Leave the nuclear business to the professionals.” ✈️😎

And they weren’t shy about telling the Navy, “You boys just stay out there with your cruisers and torpedoes. Go roll around the ocean looking important while we handle the real strategic work.” To the Air Force, rocket science was already barely manageable on dry land. Launching a ballistic missile underwater? That sounded like something dreamed up by lunatics, whiskey drinkers, and a few engineers who hated sleep. They probably laughed their tails off at the thought. 😂😂😂But the Navy calmly looked over, rolled up its sleeves, and effectively said: “Hold my beer and watch this.” 🍺

Because while the Air Force bragged loudly, the Navy quietly began building something terrifying: a way to launch nuclear missiles from a ghost beneath the sea. 👻🌊 A submarine that could sneak close to targets, dramatically shorten missile flight time, stay hidden, and deliver the same “end your day” power as a bomber — except the enemy would have zero idea where it came from.

That’s where our girl Scorpion rolled into destiny. Admiral Arleigh “31-Knot” Burke looked at the world, squinted like Clint Eastwood before doing something righteous, and said, “We need a way to guarantee the other guy never wants to start this fight.” He turned to Rear Admiral “Red” Raborn, who looked at impossible problems like Southern grandmas look at stubborn stains: “Give me a minute and hush.” 🧠💪 And standing behind everything like the nuclear prophet of judgment was Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, who made sure if something had uranium in it, it would work flawlessly or someone would suffer. ⚛️🔥

Then someone — probably wired on 39 cups of coffee and divine inspiration — said, “What if we take the brand-new fast attack Scorpion… and cut it in half **while she’s still being built**?” You could almost hear the Navy shipyards blink. A nuclear submarine. Cut. In. Half. That idea was either the dumbest thing in military history or the most brilliant stroke of American engineering ever conceived.

Spoiler: It was genius.

They rolled Scorpion into Electric Boat like a tractor being rebuilt in Grandpa’s barn, split her open like Thanksgiving turkey 🍗😳, slid in a 130-foot ballistic missile compartment, and packed it with sixteen Polaris ballistic missiles. Then the Navy looked at that transformed beast and said, “You ain’t Scorpion anymore.” ❌ Instead: “You are USS GEORGE WASHINGTON.” ⚓️Still fast. Still sleek. Still mean. But now she carried civilization-ending power if required. And unlike later giant missile subs, she still had fast attack DNA. She wasn’t a slow-moving ocean whale. She was a nuclear linebacker with attitude. The Soviets didn’t just fear her missiles — they feared the fact they could probably never find her. Because when you can’t locate the gun, you tend not to start the fight. 😏💥

On July 20, 1960, when George Washington launched the first submerged Polaris missile, history tilted in America’s favor. Somewhere in the Soviet Union, a radar tech probably stared at a screen and whispered, “…well dang.” Suddenly the laughs got quieter. The Air Force wasn’t laughing anymore. Because the Navy had just built something that didn’t need a runway, didn’t need a silo, and didn’t need permission from anyone but the ocean. The U.S. had created the ultimate Cold War sheriff — hidden, unstoppable, and always watching. 👀🌍Now here’s where we slow down, take hats off, and speak with reverence. ⚓️ The name Scorpion didn’t disappear. It was reassigned to another submarine commissioned in 1960, and in 1968, that USS Scorpion was lost at sea with all hands. 🌊🖤 No humor here. No punchlines. Just honor. There is a painful irony in history: the original Scorpion hull never saw war… because she became George Washington, a boat whose mere existence helped prevent war. But the name — the warrior identity — fulfilled its fate the hardest way possible. Those men wore dolphins. They stood the watch. And the sea kept them. We remember. Always. 🙏

From that one wild decision came Polaris… Poseidon… Trident… the “41 for Freedom”… Ohio-class… and soon Columbia-class. Every silent patrol. Every night peace stayed peace. Every time deterrence worked. It all traces back to the day the Navy said, “Let the Air Force keep flying. We’ll take care of the oceans… and we’ll make sure nobody ever wants to start a fight.” Sometimes genius sounds like madness. Sometimes warriors keep peace instead of firing shots. Sometimes America pulls off miracles. And sometimes… the Navy wins the argument the loudest way possible. ⚓️

Also a bonus picture of the first latte art to actually resembles a heart as opposed to a random blob (proud moment).

My thought so far:

Turin SK40: This thing is awesome. Granted the Calphalon Temp IQ worked for me, but this guy is so much quieter and faster. Dialing in has been some work. Still need some tweaking but it’s been great. It does require me to clean coffee ground each time, especially with the white color, but I’m loving it so far. And for $200 bucks it’s a deal.

Bambino plus: $350 at homegoods. This has been a great machine so far. It heats up quickly which is nice. The steam wand is better than what I had before. The milk has been creamier than I’ve ever done before and faster. The smaller portafilter is something I need to get use too, I’m spilling coffee ground everywhere, also all my accessories from before don’t fit, so need to get new ones. It’s a smaller profile too so gives me room in my coffee cabinet, but I need a smaller scale now. Autofrother is nice, but don’t use too much. Also it purges lots of water, so I always have to empty the tray and occasionally get accidentally squirted on by the steam wand.

Overall excited! If you guys have any recommended accessories you recommend let me know! Thanks.

My boyfriend (29m) and I (30f) have been together for about 3.5 years, living together for 1.5 years, and we have a dog together. Overall, I’d describe our relationship as very loving and harmonious. About a year into the relationship, he was diagnosed with autism, which explained a lot of his struggles with sensory overload and stress. Since then, we’ve been trying to navigate that together, and most of the time it works well.

However, sometimes situations come up where I genuinely don’t know how to handle things anymore.

Today was one of those days. Over Christmas, we mostly spent time just the two of us. We only had one short visit (about two hours) from a close mutual friend. Days ago, my boyfriend and I had explicitly discussed inviting my godmother and godfather over for coffee and cake today. We chose the day together, knowing in advance that they only visit once or twice a year and that they are both around 70 years old and need about 1.5 hours by public transport to get to us.

Everything was agreed on well in advance.

About an hour before they were supposed to arrive, I noticed my boyfriend becoming increasingly restless and irritable. To add context: he works a very demanding care job and, despite having a few days off over Christmas, he also scheduled himself for two extra gastronomy shifts that even his therapist advised against. So he was already overwhelmed, partly due to his own planning.

While I was taking care of breakfast, the dishwasher, household stuff, and walking our dog, he suddenly became fixated on taking apart an IKEA coat rack that honestly wasn’t urgent at all. He then couldn’t put it back together and got more and more frustrated. At some point, he kind of exploded and said he didn’t want my relatives to come, even though they were already on their way.

He started blaming me, saying I had hung the jackets “wrong” and that’s why the coat rack was broken, and accused me of just calmly eating breakfast while he was stressed (I didn’t even finish one toast because I was busy) which felt really unfair, given everything I’d been doing all morning.

This is a recurring pattern: when he’s overwhelmed, instead of dealing with it internally or communicating calmly, he looks for someone to blame — and that person is usually me.

He then locked himself in the bedroom shortly before my relatives arrived. I obviously couldn’t cancel at that point. After about 1.5 hours, he came out but was very cold and kinda unfriendly, which made the whole visit extremely uncomfortable for me. I was honestly on the verge of crying in front of my relatives.

I do understand that he sometimes needs to withdraw due to autism, and when he communicates that respectfully, I have no problem with it at all. What hurt me was the way he spoke to me beforehand, blamed me, and then made the atmosphere so tense.

At one point before they arrived, he also made a passive-aggressive comment along the lines of “I love my apartment,” clearly implying that he can’t even enjoy his own home because I’m “taking it over” with my relatives — which feels absurd, considering how rarely we have visitors and how everything is always discussed and agreed on beforehand.

After my relatives left and before he went to work, I told him that I expect an apology when he comes home later. He reacted very dismissively and asked what he should even apologize for. I told him that if he doesn’t see a problem with how he treated me, he can sleep on the couch tonight (never happened before). I want him to understand that speaking to me this way is not okay.

For additional context: I have complex PTSD from a very difficult childhood where I was often used as an emotional punching bag. Because of that, I’m extremely sensitive to being blamed or projected onto, and I really don’t want to become his outlet for stress.

Now I’m wondering: Am I overreacting for expecting an apology and setting this boundary? Or am I being unfair given his autism and overwhelm?

1pxvacm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1pxvacm/in_defence_of_mikefinn/,In defence of Mike/Finn,"I’ve commented this on so many posts that have singled out Mike’s character to be flat this season and Finn’s performance to be lacklustre that I’m actually worried people are going to start accusing me of being Finn’s mother lurking here 😂 I’m really not, but I thought I’d just say all of this in a post rather than in 16 different comments. 

My fellow emotionally avoidant individuals, HOW many times have you been accused of being flat, uncaring, or selfish when your brain is actually a white hot vortex of anxiety and raw feeling that you cannot make sense of, let alone express? To me, that is 1000% what Mike’s arc is about this season. He’s taken a step back and checked out because he cannot. cope. anymore. He’s actively dissociating (refer back to the scene in the hospital with Nancy after he gets the coffee), he’s giving his friends and family ANY emotion he can, but he’s actually got very little left to give. In a traumatic situation, your brain goes into absolute overdrive, and then afterwards you’re just left to crash. This has been happening to Mike for years. 

He’s also not a little boy anymore. As you age, it’s so common to naturally lose a lot of confidence and assurance in your sense of self and your self expression, particularly if you’ve been through trauma. It’s really hard to reckon with, but it’s so realistic and for Finn to pick up on this as a very young actor, I commend him for it highly.  

I think this is a really interesting and thoughtful acting choice, and it’s controversial because it’s a very different approach and one that requires nuance and sensitivity to understand, especially as it isn’t ever going to be “scene stealing”. From the outside perspective, it is easy to see it as disengagement, in real life and on screen. I think Finn has that nuance and sensitivity in spades, particularly as he’s talked about using his own experiences with depression and anxiety for this performance. I don’t read him as flat at all, his scenes and interactions have been some of my absolute favourites this season. 

Now, that being said, he’s doing his best with some questionable material, that is for SURE. The writing has irked me in places this season, I am not going to lie. Also, that man has absolutely no chemistry with Millie and he never did, they are colleagues and their relationship gives only colleagues. That’s why he can’t be in a scene with Sadie for longer than 2 seconds anymore, because they have a natural chemistry that trumps Mike and El in spades (chemistry does not always mean romantic, before anyone starts on me). I’m not into that ship mainly because of the fans, but I will say that he even has much better chemistry with Noah. With David Harbour even 😂 basically, just about everyone.   

I wish the writers would let Mike and El go in the same way as Jonathan and Nancy. To me, they’re trauma bonded even WORSE than J/N. ",4,1766938865.0,StrangerThings,5,0.83,False

I was watching videos about the **Nespresso Vertuo Pop** on YouTube and came across this [official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS6bRX_wIr0) uploaded by Nespresso.

I just want to confirm if my understanding is correct. The capsule used in the video looks like an **espresso capsule**, so I’d normally expect a small amount of water. However, it seems that by **holding the power button while it’s brewing**, the machine continues pouring until you manually stop it, allowing you to reach your desired water volume—even when using a smaller capsule.

After doing this, does the machine **remember that volume** and set it as the new default for that specific capsule size (such as espresso or other lower-ml capsules)? Meaning, every time you use that same type of capsule afterward, it will automatically brew using that custom volume.

If this is correct, has anyone here tried it already? How was your experience?",3,1766938847.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False
