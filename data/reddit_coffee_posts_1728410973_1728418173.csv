I'll be traveling for 17 days in January 2025 and hitting three main spots: New York, New Orleans, and Puerto Rico. Budget is quite relaxed but obviously don't want to go crazy, what I priced up in this post came to about $2500 for flights and accommodation.

* New York: A no brainer really, there's everything to do here, plus it’s where most of the cheapest UK flights land. I’ll spend 5 nights here.
* New Orleans: Always been on my list, I'm not totally sure why, possibly the mix of good food, music, and unique colonial architecture / culture. It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, maybe just for that Gumbo. Another 5 nights.
* Puerto Rico: For winter sun and the Spanish-American cultural blend, the rest of the trip will be quite active, so this feels like a nice way to relax before heading home; 5 nights here to finish.

Here’s where I could use some help: I’d like to visit a smaller, less touristy (for Brits anyway) city for 2 nights between New York and New Orleans. Initially, I thought of something down the East Coast, but then I came across Portland, Maine. As a bearded man in his thirties, the cliché rings true and I'm big into craft beer, and as a big NEIPA drinker, going to New England really appeals to me. I hear Portland has 27 breweries in the city, and will also have that smaller city vibe, so I think I'd really enjoy it there. However, it’s a bit tricky to reach and expensive for just two nights. So the question, Is it worth it, or would you suggest elsewhere?

About me: I’m an extroverted introverted, so really enjoy meeting locals and fellow travellers alike when my social battery allows it, so I’ll look for social accommodations and group activities like walking tours or pub crawls when in the bigger cities, are these a thing in NYC/NO? I live for good coffee, good food and good beer, and seek them out everywhere I go, I'm expecting to be very happy in America in this regard. I'm also a metalhead, and have always been curious about the American metalcore scene, would love to find some bars along the way that align with that, maybe thats more likely in NYC? Oh, and I’d love to see an NHL game whilst here! I see Rangers vs. Blue Jackets is on when I'm planning to be in town, anyone know how hard it is to get a ticket for this?

Thanks for reading this far, none of this is set in stone, so any recommendations, critiques, or advice would be hugely appreciated! Oh, and finally, how welcoming is the US for British solo travellers, and am I going to have fun?",1,1728417735.0,travel,0,1.0,False

Traveling with a backpack is one of the best ways to ensure that you remain mobile, flexible, and comfortable. Whether you’re a frequent flyer, a weekend adventurer, or someone planning their next big trip, mastering the art of smart backpack packing is essential. With the right strategy, you can maximize your space, stay organized, and reduce stress throughout your journey. In this article, I’ll share my favorite tips for saving space and keeping your items orderly, all while highlighting the best travel backpack options for different needs.

When packing smart, the ultimate goal is to fit all your essentials in a well-designed travel backpack without feeling overloaded. From organizing your clothes to selecting the right backpack, we’ll cover every aspect to help you prepare for your next trip.

# Why a Travel Backpack is the Best Option

Before diving into packing techniques, let’s take a moment to appreciate why a travel backpack is such an excellent choice for various travel needs.

# 1. Hands-Free Convenience

When using a travel backpack, your hands are free to navigate the airport, hold onto a coffee, or take a few photos on your phone. Unlike suitcases, backpacks allow you to move through crowds without dragging anything behind you, making them a top pick for city travelers and outdoor adventurers alike.

# 2. Flexibility in Tight Spaces

One of the biggest advantages of a backpack is its ability to squeeze into tight spaces. Whether you’re hopping on public transportation or stowing your bag in an overhead bin, a compact **best travel backpack** will fit easily, reducing the hassle of finding storage.

# 3. A Place for Everything

Many **travel backpacks** are thoughtfully designed with a wide range of compartments and pockets. This makes it easier to stay organized, even when packing for longer trips. You can separate your clothes from your toiletries, electronics, and even travel documents, ensuring everything is easy to find.

The [Nomatic Travel Backpack](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/nomatic-travel-pack.html) is one of the most popular choices for those seeking a sleek and spacious design with numerous compartments. Its versatility makes it the perfect all-rounder for long-term travel or quick weekend getaways.

# Tip 1: Start with a Packing List

The first step to smart packing is creating a detailed list of everything you need to bring. This will help you avoid over-packing, which is one of the main causes of wasted space in your **travel backpack**. It’s easy to overestimate what you’ll need when traveling, but a concise packing list will keep you on track and ensure that every item in your backpack serves a purpose.

# Break Your List into Categories:

* **Clothing**: Pack based on your itinerary and the weather forecast for your destination. Bring versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched.
* **Toiletries**: Bring only the essentials in travel-sized containers to save space and avoid going over TSA limits for liquids.
* **Tech Gear**: Bring chargers, adapters, and any necessary electronics, but avoid bringing unnecessary items.
* **Miscellaneous**: Don’t forget important documents, medications, or a small first-aid kit.

The [Osprey Farpoint 55](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/osprey-farpoint-55l-travel-backpack.html) is ideal for those looking for a **best backpack for travel**. Its 40-liter capacity makes it perfect for those who like to travel light, and its multiple compartments allow for easy organization of your packing list essentials.

# Tip 2: Utilize Packing Cubes for Efficiency

Packing cubes is a game-changer when it comes to saving space and staying organized. These lightweight fabric containers help you group similar items, making it easier to find what you need without unpacking your entire **travel backpack**.

# Benefits of Packing Cubes:

* **Compression**: Some packing cubes offer compression, which can further minimize the space your clothing takes up.
* **Organization**: You can organize by category — shirts in one cube, pants in another. This helps when looking for specific items during your trip.
* **Easy Accessibility**: No more digging through your entire **best travel backpack** to find that one pair of socks!

# How to Use Packing Cubes:

Start by folding or rolling your clothes (more on that in a minute) and placing them into the cubes by type or day. Label the cubes if necessary. This way, you can grab the exact items you need without disturbing the rest of your belongings.

The [BAGAIL 6 Set Packing Cubes](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/bagail-6-set-packing-cubes.html) are lightweight and durable, providing different sizes for easy packing. Their high-quality material makes them a great investment for anyone serious about organized travel.

# Tip 3: Roll, Don’t Fold, Your Clothes

Packing efficiency largely comes down to how you fold your clothes. Rolling your clothes instead of folding them flat is one of the most effective ways to save space in your **best backpack for travel**. It also helps to reduce wrinkles, which is a huge plus, especially if you have limited access to an iron.

# Why Rolling Works:

* **Maximizes Space**: Rolled clothes take up significantly less space than folded ones, allowing you to pack more efficiently.
* **Reduces Wrinkles**: Rolling keeps your clothes smooth and wrinkle-free.
* **Compact**: Rolled items fit neatly into small compartments or packing cubes.

Rolling is particularly useful when paired with packing cubes, which further compress your clothes, making the most of the space inside your **best travel backpack**.

# Tip 4: Choose a Backpack with Multiple Compartments

Organization begins with your backpack itself. A well-designed **travel backpack for women** or **travel backpack for men** should offer multiple compartments to keep your items sorted. When everything has its own place, not only does it help with organization, but it also saves time when you need to find something quickly.

# Important Features to Look For:

* **Dedicated Laptop Sleeve**: If you’re carrying a laptop, a padded sleeve is a must.
* **Quick-Access Pockets**: These are useful for stowing items like your passport, phone, or travel documents.
* **Water Bottle Holder**: A side pocket for your water bottle keeps you hydrated on the go without needing to dig through your bag.
* **Compression Straps**: These straps help reduce the overall size of your packed bag, ensuring you don’t exceed carry-on size limits.

The [Nomatic Travel Backpack](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/nomatic-navigator-travel-backpack-32l.html) is ideal for travelers who need plenty of storage and organization features. It comes with RFID-blocking pockets, a cord pass-through for chargers, and durable, water-resistant material, making it the **best backpack for travel** for those who prioritize security and convenience.

# Tip 5: Utilize the Bundle Method for Bulky Items

Even the most organized packers sometimes need to bring bulkier items like sweaters, jackets, or shoes. Instead of packing these items individually, try using the bundle method.

# How to Use the Bundle Method:

1. **Layer Bulky Items**: Start by laying bulkier items (like jackets) flat at the bottom of your **travel backpack**.
2. **Pack Around Smaller Items**: Place smaller, lightweight items (like socks or t-shirts) in the center and wrap the bulky item around them.
3. **Keep it Compact**: This creates a compact “bundle” that takes up less space and prevents bulky items from dominating your backpack’s interior.

# Tip 6: Invest in a Travel Toiletry Bag

A good toiletry bag can make all the difference when packing for a trip. Look for one that is compact, has multiple compartments, and is made from waterproof material to prevent leaks from ruining the rest of your belongings.

# How to Pack Toiletries:

* **Liquids**: Opt for solid alternatives where possible. For example, use a solid shampoo bar instead of a liquid one to avoid spills and TSA restrictions.
* **Compartments**: Use a toiletry bag with multiple sections to keep your items organized. Separate items like toothpaste, soap, and lotions from your makeup or razors.

The [Sea to Summit Traveling Light Hanging Toiletry Bag](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/sea-to-summit-travellinglight-hanging.html) is a durable and lightweight option. It features multiple compartments and a hanging hook, making it easy to use in any bathroom.

# Tip 7: Organize Your Electronics

If you’re like most travelers, you probably have at least a few electronics in your backpack — whether it’s your phone, laptop, or camera. Keeping these organized and protected is key to avoiding tangled cords and damaged devices.

# How to Stay Organized:

* **Laptop Sleeve**: Most modern **travel backpacks for men** and women include a dedicated laptop sleeve for extra protection. If your backpack doesn’t, invest in a padded sleeve.
* **Cable Organizers**: Velcro straps or dedicated cord organizers help keep chargers, headphones, and other accessories neat.

Packing smart can transform your travel experience. The key is to stay organized and maximize the space in your **best backpack for travel**. By using packing cubes, rolling your clothes, and selecting the right **travel backpack for women** or **travel backpack for men**, you can ensure that everything has its place. Plus, investing in smart travel gear — like a [Nomatic Travel Backpack](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/nomatic-navigator-travel-backpack-32l.html), [Osprey Farpoint 55](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/osprey-farpoint-55l-travel-backpack.html), or [Sea to Summit Toiletry Bag](https://amznrv.blogspot.com/2024/10/sea-to-summit-travellinglight-hanging.html) — can help take the stress out of packing.

With these tips, you’re ready to pack efficiently, save space, and stay organized for your next adventure. Whether you’re jetting off for a long vacation or packing for a quick weekend trip, a little bit of preparation goes a long way toward ensuring smooth travels.",1,1728417667.0,vctravelbackpack,0,1.0,False

I’m an experienced SEO professional based in the UK, currently running a successful freelance operation with a small team. I’m exploring the idea of partnering with someone who shares a strategic, long-term vision to help scale operations and build something sustainable.

**What I Bring:**

* Active clients and a proven ability to acquire more
* Expertise in technical SEO, content creation, on-page SEO, and digital PR with well-established SOPs
* Strong client communication and account management skills
* A track record of delivering results in a fast-paced, competitive market

**What I'm Looking For:**

* A partner who has experience managing a larger agency or scaling operations
* Someone highly analytical, great at projecting and planning for the future
* Expertise in creating efficient systems for handling multiple clients
* Strong communication skills, comfortable with email, phone, and video conferencing
* A complementary skill set—someone I can bounce ideas off, and who adds value to our combined offering

I go once or twice a week. One of the coaches/instructors caught my eye. Idk her exact age, but she's around mine, +/- 4 years. We had some friendly exchanges, good banter, etc, and she'd give me some tips to work on my game. Never wanted to ask her out while she was working, so I just let it be.

Couple days ago, after the class, I was packing up and she asked me to play a few points with her (I'm one of the more skilled ones in the class). I guess she wanted to actually play for a minute instead of just coaching and running drills. We hit to each other for 10 mins before the next class started and had some good points and a few laughs. Turns out she was done coaching for the day and was leaving the same time I was. Figured this was my shot.

We walk to parking lot, chatting about the game, etc, and before we parted ways, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. Thought I'd keep it casual. Her immediate response was ""umm, sure, but I'm not really looking to date right now.""

Now, after an 8 year relationship fell apart, I had one relationship that lasted a year, and now I'm back on the market. I'd usually kept to dating apps, and have never really asked a girl out in person, so I count it as a win that I had the courage to put myself out there, but I'm also a little disappointed cause I was sure this woman would say yes. Like I said, during classes we'd always having little banter. And I thought by asking for coffee it'd be a chance to see each other outside of the usual setting to see if there was the potential for a connection. So for her to just shut down the idea of dating preemptively is, well, yeah, just disappointing.

Anyway, she did give me her number and I'm not really sure how to move forward. Do I text her and just say ""hey nice chatting, see you when I see you"" and drop it? Or should I still try to get coffee with her sometime? It'd be nice to have more friends/connections where I live, but I'm not gonna lie to myself cause I am definitely interested in her.

On a more general note, how do I know when women in their 30s are actually interested? It seems a strange age where some are looking to date, while others are in career mode, or just so jaded.

I happened upon a nail salon and my impulse gremlin said, ""You deserve a treat.""  I popped into the salon and found, to my delight, that they had openings for walk ins.  The technician asked if I wanted tips, ""YOLO"" the impulse gremlin said.  I had never done nail tips before nor did I know what the process entailed.  I happily said ""yes"" to the nail tips.  We sit down and the technician begins the process.  I. hated. every. minute of it.  The nail grinding about sent me through the roof.  They slap the tips and acrylic on, paint them and send me on my way.  

  
That evening I display the results to my very understanding husband and confess that I felt like I wasted $75.00.  Definitely wasn't my thing, but I figured they may grow on me.  Fast forward to this past weekend and we're vacationing with family in a cabin in the woods.  The nails are starting to show some wear and I hate them even more.  They kept getting caught in my hair and a pie shaped chunk of the polish just peeled of the index finger of my left hand.  Could not wait to get back and pry them off.

Today I'm doing some housework; unpacking, laundry from the weekend, dishes, etc.  After struggling to shut the soap dispenser on the dishwasher with these talons I make the decision that they must go now.  Especially since I have an important meeting early in the morning tomorrow.  Chipped acrylics probably wouldn't be the best look.  We live 30 minutes out of town, so I figure I can just take them off myself instead of making the trip to a salon.  A quick Google search later and I'm sitting on the couch with the fingers of my left hand wrapped in acetone soaked cotton balls and tin foil.  Figured 30 minutes should do it.  It did not.  So I wait an hour.  Nothing.  TWO HOURS LATER and I now have to go to the bathroom.  Something you should know about me is I am almost debilitatingly left handed.  So there I am trying to handle some personal business with my right hand which is almost completely useless in that scenario.  I finish up and pulled my leggings back on as best I can.  

Determined to not be undermined by offending acrylics I storm into the kitchen, remove the foil fingers and start prying at the nails with the metal nail cleaner thing from my nail clippers.  The best I got was a shard chipped off the index finger.  The rest are completely unchanged.  Even the polish is still fully intact and shiny.  

""There must be a way"", I think to myself.  I will not be defeated.  The clothes washer chimes the end of it's cycle from the basement and I'm fully engrossed in YouTube tutorials of acrylic nail removal.  That's when my husband comes home to find, the tin foil and bag of cotton balls on the coffee table in the living room along with a water glass filled with acetone, the dishwasher open and half loaded, a basket of unfolded laundry on the kitchen island, and me hunched over the kitchen counter in very crooked leggings furiously scrolling on my phone.

I am F 16 and he is M 17. We have been dating for two years now and it is absolutely wonderful (ps dont give me all the bs about being young and its not the end of the world I genuinely want to sort things out..) Anyway we have been stuggling with trust and communicating for a few months and yesterday he almost broke up with me. I convinced him not to bc I could see his pain to not do it. Also I stayed home from school because it shatterd me. I cried for hours on end and I got some little rashes under my eyes from all the crying lol, but I feel like this is all my fault. 

Recently I kinda went on a strike and gave him the silent treatment for not loving or buying me anything and this hurted him deeply. I understand now I was to materialistic and dont care about dates and stuff bc I know he is struggling with his own problems and we are kids like bro tiktok got me influenced thinking im twenty lol. Atm he is in therapy for me bc he wants to be and get better and its so sweet and I am so greatful he is getting the help he deserves. But it gets worse I had a problem with friends last year and tried to be popular backfired heavily and it hurted him so bad bc I hid messeges from likr a guy I was talking to (its sounds absurd but I thought he was gay and just saw him as a friend I would never cheat ons my sweet boy.) Yet this broke him and I know I lost his trust and I am not suprised he wanted to break up with me, but I did start to change by not talking to these people and just loving him more. Also he never really kept his promises to be better and put more effort in but ik why bc of how awful I was. 

Now that you have more background let me tell you about yesterday. He took me out for coffee after school and we were going to talk about our problems and I told him I feel emotionally disconnected and he started to say mabye we should break up bc we changed to much or that we have too many problems and I told him it wont change overnight but we have to try. So we stayed together and talk about it tmr again but I never knew how much I really care untill it was almost gone. 

I did some research and found out I mabye emotionally abused him by calling him names and just being really rude not at all how you should argue. I think it plays a part in our communication skills that are really suffering atm. I also think mabye I act this way becasue thats how my parents acted before getting divorced to idk really know how to communicate tbh but I want to try for him and our relationship. I wrote two notes about how much I loved him and what bothers me about our fighting. I also mentioned how ik he is struggling with opening up to me again thank you therapy and I want to give him the space he needs in our relationship to be more open and I want to comfort him with his problems and not always burden him with mine bc ik he needs more support then me bc I did so much damage. I really love him he is always so sweet and gentle and I dont deserve him but i love him so much I want to be better for him and help him. 

Thanks for reading reddit and yes ik I have acted poorly please dont give me a lecture but help me figure out how I can be better gf and how we both can understand the others feelings so we can just be happy again. I love him so much its not even funny. But thanks for reading and the advicee. 	",2,1728417247.0,dating,2,1.0,False
1fz8vzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1fz8vzk/review_the_midlands_whisky_festival_2024/,Review - The Midlands Whisky Festival - 2024,"

Last weekend I attended the, IMO, excellent Midlands Whisky Festival, and thought I’d give my thoughts, in case anyone is interested.



CAVEAT: I have no association whatsoever with the Organisers (other than buying their stuff!), so I might make mistakes in some of the details below. Apologies.



**The Event:**

A mid-size whisky festival, with some smaller outfits and a few of the bigger groups. A good variety of distributors/Importers, OBs and IBs attend. It lasts for two days, 11:30 to 17:30; over a weekend. Two/Three Masterclasses/Tasting Sessions are held each day, for those who are interested. Overall, there were around 400+ drams. This year there was also a separate rum room, with around 50 options.

It is held in Birmingham.



**The Organiser:**

The event is carried out by Nickolls & Perks, a well known outfit in the Wine and Spirits world. They’ve been in business since the very late 1700s, and the current owners bought the company in the 1940s. They offer regular wine and spirit tastings at their own cellars, but the Midlands Whisky is their largest production.

In addition to retail sales, they also offer a variety of investment, storage and purchasing services.

They’re also in the exclusive spirit offerings game.

The event is well organised, with few, if any incidents. They communicate dream drams, dram lists, food partners, etc. in a timely and accurate fashion.

To illustrate this, an example from this year: Due to no fault of their own, a presenter for a Masterclass had to cancel his attendance due to an emergency (absolutely fair enough, life happens to everyone). Knowing that this person had been a significant factor in people signing up for said Class, they:

- Promptly informed all attendees of the change.

- Answered any questions posed.

- Offered a full refund.

- Offered a priority seat at a future tasting given by this presenter.

That, to me, is a perfectly handled issue, can’t ask for anything fairer than that.



**The Exhibitors:**

A very nice mix. In no particular order:

Aberfeldy / Ardnahoe / Adelphi / Benromach / G&M / Buffalo Trace / Benriach / Dalmore / Cotswolds / Glen Scotia / Hunter Laing / Kilchoman / Diageo / Paul John / Yamazakura / Tomatin / Tomintoul / Pokeno / Nikka / And quite a few more (I feel that gives you a good sense of the options).

The Rums were from Diplomático, El Dorado, Foursquare, Ninefold, and Scratch.

It doesn’t reach the volume of something like the London Exchange Show or the Paris Show, but still quite a bit larger than the smaller “regional” shows (Liverpool, Leeds, etc.)

This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it gives one more time to interact with the exhibitors, and gives them more space to interact with the attendees. No one will rush you off the stand.

Want to stay drinking at Artful Dodger for an hour chatting with them? Go for it.

Have weird and niche questions for the people at G&M and McDavid? They will happily (hopefully!) chat for ages.

Want to delve into the intricacies of Loch Lomond weirdness? No drama.



**The Dream Drams:**

It works on a token system, ie., any bottle under about 500 MSRP is free to try, anything over that will be worth X amount of tokens. You get one “free” token per day you attend, and can purchase additional ones for 10 quid each. This makes some unicorn drams suprisingly affordable, and indeed some participants only attend to have a go at these bottlings. These dream drams run the range, from a Inverleven 38 to Littlemills, from a Port Ellen 24 to a Sprinbank 25, to a Pappy 15. If you can’t find something to love… well, I don’t know what to tell you.



**The Masterclasses:**

One the whole, fantastic.

This year was the first one that I’ve attended that had a somewhat weaker Class IMO, with great liquid but not the best presentation. But every other I’ve gotten to attend has been massively enjoyable. I’m still somewhat new on my scotch journey, and can really get a lot out of an hour/90 minutes with an expert, and often with an incredibly knowledgeable and happy to expound audience alongside.



**The Attendees:**

Pretty great. While there’s a little extra drinking, and one or two who need to be helped out, haven’t really seen any concerning incidents.

Some journalists/influencers do attend, but luckily there’s a definite lack of selfie cameras/recording people all over the place. They’re there to have a chat and learn. Long may it remain so.



**The Miscellaneous Partners:**

Last couple of years there have been chocolate, charcuterie, cheese/sandwich, and coffee stands, along with a more “meal” type option. In order, this year we had Kneals Chocolate, Hereford Charcuterie, Anderson&Hill, There Goes Coffee, and Baked in Brick.

Not a bad word to say about any of them really, though I didn’t manage to get to Baked in Brick this year.

In any case, if you fancy something else, you’re in the centre of Birmingham, so plenty of options a block away.



**The Store:**

I felt this year’s was a bit less competitive price wise, but still decent options overall.



**Therefore:**

This festival sits in a really special position. It’s big enough to be very well organised, attract true world class talent for the Masterclasses, and bring in liquid you won’t easily find elsewhere. All at a highly attractive price point.

And yet, it’s not so big and ponderous you need to queue 20 minutes to get to a stand, only to get a pour and then told to move along. You won’t see a stand so incredibly busy you don’t even bother going.

I think it sits in a really neat Goldilocks Zone. Those new to the scene can participate in a very welcoming environment. Those more experienced, will be forearmed with the dram and dream dram lists, and can still target some very special liquid.

All in all, a no brainer for me, and I will definitely keep attending.",3,1728417147.0,Scotch,1,1.0,False

He hasn’t bought my coffee in a really long time either, we are coffee snobs so we get coffee a lot. He has only bought me flowers once, and it was on the day before Valentine’s Day.

My Avoidant:

I have nothing left to say other than what is written inside this letter if you so choose to read it. I had so many unanswered questions I hadn’t gotten to ask. So many sleepless nights throughout this miserable year have come to pass. If only walls could talk… Today I find myself in a condition of clarity, physically spiritually & emotionally at peace with myself. I no longer question who I am or my value nor do I not recognize the life lessons you have taught me. I recognize my boundaries and others, I notice red flags in others even before they say a word. I once again value healthy morals in people who now are few and far between, I notice unhealthy un healed women who carry wounds from the decisions made of their past. I find myself today with very little if any, the ability to sympathize and ignore my feelings towards those types of people. It is unfortunate… the lessons you’ve taught me.. the lessons that trust is just a word and nothing anyone stands by. The feeling of betrayal is something I will never let myself forget , nor will i forget what I felt was love from you. You see, your love and your betrayal for so many years has scared me so deeply that in order for me to heal it took so much more pain to go through than any “ ordinary “ man could possibly endure. Today, you see me as someone you know physically but under that, I am unknown. So much about me has changed and I have begun to rebuild my best life using the best version of me alone as I do not trust a single soul. I know this anger’s you because now you are beginning to feel the loss of me. I don’t have the right to tell you when you start your journey of healing, that was your choice. Those emotions are real that you’re experiencing.. The need to say things you feel cut me deep.. The problem is, you have already done that and nothing you can possibly do or say will wound me again. Your threats.. they don’t affect me.. Everything you are feeling now is what I felt almost a year ago so I understand you.. although you don’t understand yourself. As the seasons change, you will most likely become more and more depressed. The snow will come, the bitter cold will set in and you’ll ache with wanting warmth and sunshine while you lay in your bed alone with coffee being your only comfort. My only pain is knowing I couldn’t keep you mentally grounded like ( JWL ). Those shoes I said were too big to fill.. I’ve outgrown them now.. My last contribution to this letter is that I genuinely thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve put me through because I didn’t need the distraction of you effecting my life journey.

Temu Clicks Spreadsheet (Beta)   
**By:** David K?

Hey everyone, I have redone the old spreadsheet and this one is currently in beta at the moment and I'd like a few people to help test it. I'm looking for constructive criticism.

Sheet Tabs

1. Home Page
   * Explains the spreadsheet some (need to edit probably)
2. YourCodes
   * Keep track of *your* Free Coffee, Fish Land, and Farm Land game as well as letting you know when it is time for the meal.
3. ClicksToday
   * Keep track of the clicks you do today. It lets you know when you can click again by showing green for Date/Time.
4. WeeklyGames
   * Keep track of Farm Land and Fish Land clicks if you are trading it to a group for seven days. Shows you when you can click them again and makes the code link up when you can. You'll notice that it allows you to click the link for Code 2 because it is Tuesday for me.
5. List
   * Keeps track of people who clicked you which you can use weekly. You can enter a name in the search and it will say if you've gotten a click from them already.
6. Usernames
   * You can pick a game they play and add in their code, link, and day that you click them and they click you.
7. Instructions
   * Self explanatory but under construction.
8. Card999
   * This is the Discount Card 999 Promotion help tab which explains how to spend efficiently and the best way to go about it. You are going to be spending around $165 at minimum. This will help you total it and give tips. (200 Coin Promotion)

Note, to refresh the time, I made a little checkbox next to the clocks. That was an issue on the previous spreadsheet. I didn't know how to make it auto-update and it should have but didn't. Even when opening it. Now, it will force an update. Also, the instructions/introduction is old and needs to be updated. I guess, for now, mess around with it. I'll be working on a tutorial in the next day or two.

Link below - this will make yourself your own:

[Temu Guide DK - Temu Clicks Spreadsheet (Beta)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PSitpy_uUddSMobIa4WBqAbp7fQCKQM8C372WGy8GwM/copy)   
When it updates, you'll have to copy your Namelist to the new sheet.

You will have to put your information into the Namelist, especially yourself as the main person, then select yourself on the Yourcodes area. Put your PST difference (mine is -3 for EST) and it will tell you when your meals are ready for the games. I believe this should be simple to use and pretty useful for many of you. I will certainly use it to keep track of my daily clicks for two devices.

If anyone tests it please let me know what they think, if they need help, etc. I'd like to improve it. I haven't worked on it visually yet. Still working on the main pages. I will be changing the colors some to be a little more appealing. I will also be working on the new Introduction tab in a few days. Just DM me.

I'm looking for feedback. I believe most of the functions are working correctly now.

I'm compiling a list of ways/places I've met cool people as an INTJ.

Hobbies 
* Clubs e.g. chess, film, science, book clubs etc 
* Workshops
* Tech/entrepreneur/startup incubators 
* Conferences and university lectures 
* Therapy and personal development groups 
* Classes (refer back to above hobbies) 
* Community groups e.g. community gardening, volunteering at a shelter, etc
* Competitions (dnd, cards, chess, or sports, there's even writing competitions) 
* Volunteer at an event for your hobby e.g. comicon, renfairs, signings etc. 

Online
* Discord communities 
* Reddit communities 
* Look into non-needy networking and see how you can build relationships online. The internet is a great resource for introverts.

Locations 
* Community centers 
* Libraries
* Coffee shops 
* Museums 
* Bookstores 
* Parks (I met a lot of people when I had a dog) 

Protip, I know it can be tricky to approach people so instead of doing that bring a hobby to a location and people might come to you, for me that's art. For my partner it's coding in cafes (he gets approached even as a male). At the very least staff will see you as a regular and you might end up building a relationship. 

Big Takeaway: instead of focusing on socializing for socializing sake get a hobby and find people who are into that hobby.

1fz8hoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1fz8hoo/some_thoughts_after_two_months_of_treatment/,Some thoughts after two months of treatment,"I have been on treatment for rosacea for 2 months and I thought I'd share some thoughts that may be helpful for others. Everything is very subjective, not medical advice.

I started out with pretty bad rosacea (I and II), would probably be classified as quite severe. Definitely looked very red and inflamed, and my skin was very reactive.

I am on 300 mg lymecycline daily (I believe it has the therapeutic equivalent of 100 mg doxy) + I apply Soolantra in the evening.

My current full routine is:

AM
Wash face with water or gentle cleanser
Apply moisturizer on damp skin
Wait a bit and apply sunscreen
I also wear makeup when I leave the house with bigger plans (work, going out etc.)

PM
Oil cleanser
Regular cleanser
Pat skin fully dry and apply Soolantra
Wait 15-30 min and apply moisturizer

My thought/conclusions/bits of information:
- I have started seeing significant improvement after ~1 month. The 1st month was a really bumpy ride and I had no idea if I am going in the right direction. I am not sure if it was die-off or just the fact that my skin barrier was very damaged.
- At some point I decided to introduce OTC azelaic acid in the AM without consulting my doctor. It was a bad decision, I assume my skin barrier was not strong enough. I insisted with it for about a week and when I finally gave up I started seeing more improvement very fast. Less really is more for me.
- I noticed that my skin feels best when I use a moisturizer which has emollient properties too.
- In the beginning I was reacting horribly to makeup and now I don't react in any way, so I believe the issue was, again, my skin barrier being damaged.
- I don't eat spicy food and I don't drink alcohol, but I eat/drink everything else (sugar, coffee, dairy you name it). I cut out dairy for 2 weeks and saw no difference (sure, it could be too short, but it was too difficult and in the end not worth it for me). I just try to have a balanced diet.
- I don't know if it helped the rosacea or just my overall wellbeing, but I tried to reduce all stress associated with this condition, just follow my treatment and not think about anything else. I also have other health issues so I tend to overthink everything about drugs, topicals, will this help, is this working, should I stop, will this diet work etc. And it was becoming way too stressful. If you are going through this, I would advise to take a step back and keep everything simple, don't put *too* much pressure on healing the rosacea. 

I still have a long way to go, will probably have to continue with the treatment for a few more months and then maintenance, but I am finally confident it's going in the right direction, and my skin feels way more comfortable, almost not reactive at all, and looks way less red and inflamed.

If you are dealing with rosacea, don't give up, and don't let it consume you. Wishing everyone the best in their treatment.",2,1728416135.0,Rosacea,0,1.0,False

Since then, I've been passively looking and started actively looking several months ago.

A couple weeks ago, I went on a very successful M&G and we did a follow up coffee meet this past Sunday to dive into the details of what the arrangement would look like.  

She had a set of monetary expectations that she wanted to share first, this is reverse of how I've done arrangements previously, usually I'd discuss what I'm willing to offer and we go from there.

The problem at hand is she wants significantly less than my previous arrangements, about 2x less per-month than my last one.  I told her that the ask was more than reasonable and we essentially agreed to move forward, knowing I would bump it up.

My question is, do I let her know that she undervalued herself fairly significantly? Or just increase it and tell her it's because of how great she is?

I was thinking of an increase of 50% over what she asked and use the remaining 50% on gifts/bonuses/future increases over the year.  Or should I just bring it up 100% to match my last arrangement, which was fairly reasonable already.",5,1728416101.0,sugarlifestyleforum,17,1.0,False

This morning I remembered that hybrid work meant that I could take my laptop and do work *outside* of my house.... So I decided to head over to [Variety Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/variety.cafe/?hl=en) which is [located ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s7Nq6U7ZRMCo77DL8)just down Duffrin, to finish up a presentation.

This cafe oozes charm with its very 70's aesthetic. They have vintage Crock-pots and coffee pots as decor, Local Art hung up (that is for sale!), a funky paint job inside, and they have quite the assortment of mismatched mugs which was a fun touch. My cortado was served in this beautiful green glass mug that I now need to find for my own collection...

Biking wise it requires you to depart from the TVP a decent amount - but Duffrin is a Bike Friendly street so it was no problem. The Cafe also has a bike post right outside of the front door which was nice - and yes you can keep an eye on your bike while you are inside, but I didnt feel like my bike was at risk due to the outdoor patio seating being a deturant for any potential theifs.

The cafe is located in a very cute part of town - lots of historic buildings (some being faithfully restored) within the neighbourhood. With the leaves starting to turn those beautiful fall colours there is plenty to catch your eye for some photos!

Coffee wise, their cortado was good - not a particularry exciting roast - but good. It cost $4.50, so not the most expensive, and they deliver on the whole package of a nice mug, latte art, and very pleasent service so nothing to complain about there. Plus - you are supporting local. As a side note, I also ordered a standard black coffee while I was finishing up my work, that was also good - and for $3 you get a refil with your mug so that was a great deal - and the drip coffee itself was quite good.

I do also want to shout out the fact that they offer gluten free baked goods - my fiance is celiac and I can never take her to a cafe due to the fact that she isnt a coffee drinker nor can she ever have the treats - so ill be sure to circle back to this place alongside her!

Although I can deffintely make a better cortado at home (honestly its more just me preferring a stronger roast than anything they did wrong), I highly suggest coming out to this cute cafe. The vibes are just right here - its tucked away just far enough from downtown to escape any traffic, and the Barista's there are incredible nice.

Would love to hear your experiences at this place - has anyone gone to the activities they host or tried out their Hot Chocolate...looked pretty tempting!

The man now resides in peace. He solves what needs to be solved. He punishes  the Lord who gave free will. The Lord who set out to create not just Adam, but create beside him a creature that opened up a whole new world of possibilities. The man is happy now, happy with all he is.

1fz8cj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1fz8cj2/extreme_anxiety_when_hanging_out_with_partners/,Extreme Anxiety when hanging out with partner’s friends,"Hi Everyone,

I wanted to share an ongoing issue that I'm experiencing and see if anyone else can relate or has any advice for me.

 I wanted to start out by saying that I don't come off as ""someone with social anxiety"". I realize there is a vast spectrum for how people experience social anxiety, but there is definitly a stereotype. Most people I know and meet have described me as very outgoing and easy to bring places. I've often been told by other people that they see me as ""adventurous"" and I agree. I oftentimes go out by myself to coffee shops, go shopping, take random classes like improv or bicycle maintenance, etc. At my new job I've gone to work parties that even my coworkers who have been there much longer than I have opted out of because they didn't want to socialize with people from other teams they didn't know. I want to be clear though, its not that I'm not nervous to do these things, I actually get very anxious. It’s just that I've always felt that I don't want to miss out on life because of anxiety. 

So the issue I want to reach out about is specifically about my (F25) debilitating anxiety with my partner's (M27) friends. My partner and I have been dating for 2.5 years now and live seperately. Ever since our very first date, I had the feeling that he was out of my league. Yes, I found him very attractive, but it was more in a sense of social standing, rather than just looks alone. I've always been kind of a weirdo and seen myself as a bit of a proud outcast. I've always made friends with people who were more on the marginal sides of society. I've spent lots of time with ""radical"" people: hippies living and working on farms, queer punks living communally, I've had friends who are homeless (by choice and by circumstances out of their control), friends who are disabled, etc. In high school and college, I always was someone who was friendly with everyone, but never had my own group that I felt I belonged to, yet I always gravitated toward other outcasts. Always happy to hang out with whoever, but never really having my own place where I belonged. My partner fully accepts this part of me that doesn't identify with mainstream life and loves all of that about me, but personally he doesn't identify with it himself. Ever since we first met, I got the sense that he was more of a ""jock"" in school and I soon learned this was true. He played sports all of high school and had a strong friend group of guys who had a lot in common with him. 

Fast forward to us now, He is still very close with those friends and has many other friends from other areas in his life. He has his ""car friends"" who all love driving their cars together, going to car meets, and working on their cars together. He has his friends from previous jobs with their very blue collar personalities who like to get beer together and shoot the shit. And many other friends as well. This has been something I've always admired about him. I know a lot of people and am very adventurous, but I've always had a hard time making close friendships that last. This has not been an issue for him. 

The issue that I'm experiencing is that oftentimes, my boyfriend wants me to come along with him to hang out with his friends. And oftentimes I get really bad anxiety when I do hang out with them. There have been times when I had to go on a walk during the hangout or just straight up leave early because i was feeling so anxious. My anxiety usually is about not feeling like I have much in common with whichever group of his friends we are hanging out with. We've spent a lot of time with his high school friends and their girlfriends, but most of the time when I am with them, I feel like I am back in high school again and somehow I'm at the cool kid table and they're not happy that I'm there. They haven't specifically said anything mean or unwelcoming, it's mostly that I struggle to find common ground with them and end up feeling like an extra person. Many times I end up just hanging out while everyone else is talking and I start feeling very awkward. Same goes for many of his other friends, including the other women. I just feel like so much of my life has been lived so differently from these people, that its hard for me to connect. I don't get a lot of their references, I don't consume a lot of the same media, I don't have very similar hobbies, etc. My partner has reassured me on many occasions that this is ok. I don't need to be like anyone else and don't need to try to fit in and that I can just talk more about myself with them and not take it personally when they can't relate, but its just so difficult. Especially in group settings when I feel like the odd one out. 

Just this past weekend, my partner hosted a pumpkin carving party at his house and had a couple of his friends get together including me. I was anxious as usual to hang out with his friends, but pulled it together and reminded myself that it was just a low key get together and that maybe I could really get along with these friends. When they all arrived, I was able to be a part of a lot of the conversations and actively asked a lot of questions, made jokes, and felt included. As the night went on, however, I started to feel myself being less and less a part of the conversations as they started talking about topics I couldn't speak about (i.e. trips to places I'd never gone to, shows and movies their into that I'm not interested in, hobbies I'm not interested in.) Eventually, it got to the point where one person connected her phone to the tv and was just playing youtube videos from a creator she thought was funny and I just sat on the couch silently with everyone while they were all laughing and I just kept thinking, I just don't find this entertaining. Once again, by the time everyone went home, I was feeling like the odd one out and like I couldn't connect with these people as much as I'd want to.

I've talked to some friends about this dilema and they've all told me that I try so hard to be friends with everyone, but its ok to just not like what other people like and not want to hang out with my partner's friends all of the time. I'm at the point where I think I need to spend less time with his friends and more time trying to figure out what I like. He has also encouraged me to do this, saying that of course he wants me to be there with his friends, but that he knows that I end up sitting on the sidelines a lot and that its ok to not go if I don't want to. 

My last thing I want to include is that there has been talk of going on a group trip with some of his high school friends to go stay at a cabin for several days. While in theory this sounds fun to me, I'm so afraid that I'm going to, as usual, feel like I'm not a part of the group and end up feeling anxious during the stay. While there hasn't been a date set, I just don't know if I should commit to something like that given how anxiety-inducing shorter get togethers are for me.

I'd love to hear if anyone has any similar experiences or any advice. Thanks y'all <3",1,1728415769.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Going to be taking the plunge and getting a Robot in the next few days. Selling my Breville Bamino. 

A few questions that I have:

1) What is the best place to get a Robot? I see it online at Eight Ounce Coffee for $402 for the barista version but am not sure this is a reputable shop. I am mainly wary as this seems cheaper than MSRP. 
2) I plan to upgrade to a different pressure gauge. Do I need to get the barista version for this to be possible? Or can I get the standard version and save money by just installing the new gauge on that version?
3) I have a DF54 grinder. Is this going to be an OK grinder to start off with? I upgraded from a KinGrinder K2 but hope I upgraded enough. 

Sorry if these are silly questions, I do not have any friends who are into making espresso, much less manual espresso so this is my only way of asking questions.

With all the tumult in the  Chinese market, I've noticed that, on days when (generally) the Chinese securities he holds go down, the US securities go up...and vice versa. Of course this won't happen every day etc.... But, the crazy up/down in China has made it easier to see and understand.

Edit: It also seems like the Burry/Pelosi combo is pretty decent. Burry seems to expose a portfolio to ""hedging"" USA/China and Pelosi exposes ""home runs"" in the US. only time will tell.

I need to study it more, but my initial (newb) take is, a ""hedged"" portfolio ""base"" position aims to balance a portfolio in a neutral position while capturing the long term growth of both markets. My ""checkers"" understanding of hedging was very limited, but I can see the ""chess"" version now. A skilled ""trader"" would be able to profit even further by buying/selling imbalances in the ""hedge."" This guy researches and lives this 24/7 and has a research team, so while a single trader on their own, might be able learn what he does to find the right securities to create ""hedge"" it's less likely IMHO. Who has the time?

Not espousing anything here, just talking out loud. I've only been in the app for 2 weeks, but I think there is a lot to learn from the professional traders like Burry. He's not going to have a coffee with me and let me pick his brain so, reverse engineering what he does with his positions is as close as I'm going to get to learning what he does. In essence, by paying attention to his positions, he's exposing his methods. Just have to reverse engineer them.

1fz88ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1fz88ns/what_just_happened/,What just happened? ,"This experience really made me think I was going crazy. 

I work for a popular coffee and donut shop chain and on this particular day I was really busy serving a line up of customers at store front. We were short staffed, so I was handling the line all by myself when I ran out of cream in my cream machine. I didn't have time to go to the back to grab a new bag of cream, so when the baker came out front to stage some new donuts, I asked he if she would run to the fridge and bring me out a new bag of cream while I continued to serve customers. 

She brought me the bag of cream, set up the hopper, and put it in the machine for me. All I had to do was cut the hose. 

So, at the front of house we only use the lime green colored scissors, and at back of house/kitchen,  we only use black handled scissors for food prep. There is usually, one or two pairs of the lime green scissors at my station at store front. Our counter tops are black. So lime green scissors really stand out on them. You can't miss them. Additionally, we keep a very clean and organized counter area, so there really is nothing else on the counter tops except for the machines, cups, lids, stirring spoons, and the scissors. 

I reach my hand under the brewing stand to grab the scissors, and they aren't there. I check all around the store front area, anywhere I thought scissors may be, and nothing. So I asked the baker if she wouldn't mind grabbing me a pair of scissors to cut the bag of cream. 

When she came back she handed me a pair of BLACK handled scissors. I know this for certain because I immediately thought to myself, these are the wrong scissors for up here. We never use the black ones out front. They're meant for food prep. But because she's a baker, and does all the food prep, she automatically grabbed black ones. I didn't mention this to her at all.

Being in a hurry, and needing that cream open, I thought, screw it. I'm using the black ones and I'll put them in the dishwasher as soon as I have a moment. 

I get through the line of customers, maybe 4-5 minutes have passed. And I start to wipe down and sanitize my counter area. No other staff members have come up front to my area of the store. Everyone else was working drive thru. As I'm wiping everything down, I discover not one, but TWO pairs of lime green handled scissors right there underneath the brewer stands. The very first place I had looked for them???? AND, the black scissors were nowhere to be found. I was so confused! 

I thought that maybe I had misremembered, so I immediately went to ask the baker what color the scissors were that she brought me? 

She told me she had brought me the black handled scissors!?! I then asked if she had taken them back and switched them out with the green ones, she said no? She was just as confused as me. I then went around asking everyone if they had brought 2 pairs of green scissors up front, and they all said they hadn't. 

So, to summarize. One pair of black scissors turned in to 2 pairs of bright green scissors, and I still don't know what happened to the black pair? 

I felt like I was losing my mind! Anyone else have something happen like that? ",2,1728415494.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,0,0.75,False
1fz8822,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1fz8822/conflicted_feelings_for_a_coworker_in_a/,Conflicted Feelings for a Coworker in a Relationship,"I (26M) have been working with this girl (22F) for about a year, and I think I’m in love with her. The problem? She has a boyfriend.

We became friends quickly since I helped train her, and we’ve spent a lot of time together at work. We have coffee dates, she sits with me in the car during breaks, and we walk down the hall together. Honestly, it felt like we had a real connection.

However, she started flirting with me more after she got into a relationship, which confused me. She often seemed upset when I mentioned leaving work early, and our coworkers even started asking if we were together. There were moments where I thought she might have feelings for me, especially with how she looked at me and played with my hair.

Things have changed recently, though. I’ve noticed that we’ve been spending more time apart, and it feels awkward between us now. I’m trying to respect her relationship, especially since she talks about her boyfriend a lot and calls him her husband. I don’t really like him—he gives off a douchey vibe—but she seems to genuinely love him.

Some close friends have encouraged her to break up with him and get with me, but I think that might have made her uncomfortable. I’m starting to feel like I missed my chance, and while I want to get over her, it’s tough. She has some red flags, like past cheating, but she insists she wouldn’t do that with him.

I’m slowly coming to terms with the idea that I probably won’t get a chance with her. I want to stay friends, but I’m unsure if that’s healthy for me. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope?",1,1728415451.0,dating,1,1.0,False
1fz881q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/1fz881q/i_cant_get_over_the_fact_that_i_wasnt_the/,"I can't get over the fact that I wasn't ""the favorite"" in high school","I'm in my early 30s and just booked my first professional show (nonunion and local), but I find myself unable to really celebrate this huge win. I keep thinking back to high school and about how untalented and how abandoned I felt. I have this irrational desire to make my high school director and my peers that I performed with more than a decade ago know all about my accomplishments in my local theatre scene (in the next big city over an hour away), but I also just don't think they'd care even if they see it on social media.

For context: I grew up very sheltered and coddled. My parents felt like their parents didn't care enough about them so they doubled down on me and made me feel as gifted as possible with school and music. I didn't start out in theatre when most others did, I played clarinet and got the bug after being in the pit a few times and started doing high school shows junior year when I was 16. I went to a prestigious Catholic school with a very well funded arts program, and the general culture was very toxic, with the theatre and music teachers routinely switching between praising and coddling their students and yelling at them and throwing chairs and coffee mugs at them.

And I just felt like I was being punished for starting late. It wasn't about not getting the roles so much as not getting my teacher's attention and validation. The favorites got all the corrections, all the advice and feedback and were handcrafted into actual actors, whereas I was generally ignored by them. I remember one particularly stinging rejection where I had auditioned for our show choir and they told me they didn't pick me because they ""needed me to play clarinet in the band for them instead"". That was devastating and I was bullied by some of the favorites for being gay, and reported to the music director/choir teacher for making one of them feel uncomfortable since I had a normal, harmless crush on him and he was straight (he's married to a man now but that's another story).

The summer after high school, before I went away to college, I auditioned for a community theatre show with adults, was offered the lead role (Link in Hairspray), only for them to rescind their offer after 2 rehearsals for not being a good enough dancer (despite them having a dance call). The director told me people from the cast were mocking my dancing and she couldn't have been more cruel about that.

I then went to college, decided not to major in theatre, but was able to be in a few shows while majoring in a STEM field, and had a generally better experience, then I took a break for 7 years while I went to grad school and got a PhD. When Stephen Sondheim died in the last year of my grad schooling, I had a quarter life crisis and realized that I really should have tried to go into theatre professionally, and used my cushy and flexible WFH job to pursue all of the vocal and acting and dance training that I never got in high school and college and started doing community theatre while auditioning for the semi-professional shows.

I've made huge progress, played many bucket list lead roles in community theatre musicals and booked my first professional show while networking and getting noticed and called back by the other professional theatres and have made many great new friends who do value and appreciate me.

But somehow its just not enough to undo all the hurt I experienced early on. Most of my colleagues in this professional show were the favorites in their high school program and talk about those experiences fondly, and most of them have BFAs in MT, theatre, dance or music. I feel like I can't related to their experiences, and find it even a bit triggering, since all I want is for all the people that hurt me to just acknowledge my talent and my value as an artist, and apologize for the harm they did. Many of them have unfriended me on social media over the years, so they'll never know what I'm up to now unless I reach out and reconnect, and only a relatively small minority of them are still even involved in the performing arts at all, and the ones that tried to act professionally have largely been unsuccessful with only 2 exceptions.

Sorry for this crazy insane rant. I have been working through this in therapy, but so far my therapist has basically just told me that dwelling on the past isn't a worthy pursuit and that I should take control of the situation by only looking to the present and future. So I'm wondering if anyone has any advice to share.",1,1728415451.0,Theatre,1,1.0,False

1fz7t7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CandidaSupport/comments/1fz7t7q/hanging_on_by_a_thread/,Hanging on by a thread,"I am writing this if there is anyone at the beginning of their candida fighting journey, those who grew up in poverty, or to those who need advice in the what not to do's. Feel free to give this a look if you have the time.

Since I was a kid my body already exhibited a lower WBC count, so I naturally have a very weak immune system.  Given that, my gut was already unstable and I suffered from dairy, gluten and sugar intolerances since. I didn't have many resources to get tested correctly, nor expensive medication or anything as my family was quite going through it, we almost lost our house after my dad lost his job, and my mom battled breast cancer. Furthermore as I edged my way through Primary to Middle and High school my parents were anti-vaccer's, and pretty much took their say over mine with all the vaccinations we were supposed to get, so I never got any (eventually leading me to experiencing multiple viral infections later on as I had never had proper treatment)

With the lack of attention and behavioral care I had growing up as a child, I developed very serious mental health problems starting from the age of 6, and I mention this because given the impact this has on your decision making, attention span, intellectual well being, mental heath, those too further impact your risk to poor health, bacterial and fungal overgrowths, dysregulated nervous system. 

Throughout elementary school, behaviorally, and despite having a support system and friends, I acted a bit off than most, I had very severe anxiety, sense of doom, dissociation and depersonalization, failed tests, and missed school often. Take in mind I disregarded my need for a certain diet so I continued to eat all the 'norm,' like processed foods, gluten, dairy and sugar, and would even binge on it sometimes due to the lack of financial-nutritional-caloric stability my family gave me. By age 11 this all continued but I began to feel suicidal. age 12 I started getting sick, like flu sick, very very tired and fatigued, every few weeks so I started missing a ton of school. like weeks and weeks at a time. I missed half the entire school year of grade 7. in grade 8  missed another half year. the depression and suicidal thoughts got worse, my anxiety got worse as I began to get more distant with friends, more cravings and more binge eating on gluten wheat and sugar, and it continues. grade 9, same thing, I missed even over half the year of learning and neither myself or my family had the funds to afford proper bacterial and fungal health medication and support and in feeling hopeless I began smoking weed, drinking insane amounts of alcohol that no one could keep up with, still eating horrible foods, and I began to experience candida like symptoms like acne, nail fungus, dry skin and hair, weight gain, water retention, swollen lymph nodes, etc. I started getting mono and strep throat multiple times a year. Same for grade 10 and 11, I continued to eat horrible foods, experiencing horrible mental health, drinking insane amounts of alcohol to 'cope' with all of this, and never once. did i think about how this would affect my future and my adult life because needless to say I didn't really care, I had the attention span of a fly so I already knew I wasn't exactly capable of just sitting down and completing just any task or assignment so I had basically given up. I started to become a horrible person, in my own hindsight. I was a narcissist, I was entitled, rude, bratty, I was a rebel, mistreated my parents and always thought I was better than my friends, but I was extremely anxious, suicidal, depressed, lonely, numb and broken teenager. When Covid happened my attention span just couldn't handle the school work from home so I dropped out without a care in the world, and instead put alcohol, drugs, men, parties and dumb bs before it. Then there was a period that I got VERY very ill. I cut out that party lifestyle, and lived at home with my parents, first I was binge drinking, and binge eating alone, but then but I developed anorexia as my mental health declined again. I lost about 20 pounds in 1 and a half weeks. I was eating about a single walnut, black coffee, and maybe a bite of chicken, a day but working out and running a lot. On these runs I would purge and throw up the single walnut I had eaten. After 2 months of this I was at the hospital and was given laxatives. I became stuck on these laxatives because the root problem was never solved. Then I began to abuse them very badly. I felt hopeless and stuck on them, but mainly I mistook them because they made me feel skinnier, and empty, making me relapse in my eating disorder and mental health problems. 

Finally a year and a half later after trying to work multiple jobs and it never working out because I was constantly sick and calling in, I took some time in isolation to really go full force on my health and wean off laxatives (which is very hard to do) I was drinking bone broth, slippery elm powder, prunes and prune juice, doing enemas and coffee fasts, but most importantly I changed my diet to the most extreme extent I have ever done. It consisted of only whole foods low fodmap, small portions, NO gluten, dairy, sugar or processed foods, LIMITED grains, carbs, caffeine, starches. No nut butter, processed yogurt or milk with added 'gums' no nuts or seeds either due to my weak gut. This worked for a bit, my mind and body changed to an extent of which I have never experienced in my life. I experienced barely any depression, low self worth or pain and was having bowel movements daily. However, this was the only option i had as a way to live, so i was always very tired and could only go out or work maximum 2 days a week. the rest was spent at home basically doing yoga or reading etc. I decided I wanted a life again and I didnt know how to do that without involving alcohol. I still had pretty bad social anxiety. So one time a week I would allow myself a few drinks on the nights i went out, and it was okay, i could handle it better than before but then it caught up to me again. I went in for a gastroscopy and colonoscopy and it made everything worse. I declined again. Severe bloating and gas and pain and everything which put me in bed from June 2023-September 2023. I tried to go back to work in October 2023, but I had to quit shortly after as my immune system couldnt handle it and I was getting really sick again. With all of this, the hopelessness for my life I felt, my depression and suicidal thoughts, the lack of energy I had to even try any more, and no other option as I was also very financially unstable, I said fuck this I just wanna live, and relapsed in my drinking and drug abuse. I was still sick all the time but I just continued to harm my body so bad for a few months. Which put me in bed in January, February, May, June, July, and September. In March, April, and August, I was being a bit more active only due to places I was going to travel (paid for) which took EVERYTHING in me. I was still sick when I was travelling, but I made it work, because it was the only thing that made feel that was enough to keep fighting for. Everything else from my daily routine, friends, fun, a work life, education, I want all the balance badly but the energy it takes to be 'stable' in my health, or to fight the bacterial and fungal overgrowth, and how much it truly takes me out of me is too much in a way that I am just broken.

I was finally diagnosed with ADHD (mostly inattentive) a year ago, at 31 years old. I also have anxiety and depression. Such a fun trifecta! 🤦‍♀️ Anyway, I've tried both classes of stimulants and several different meds at this point. Everything just makes my anxiety worse, even low doses. Right now I'm on 20 mg Adderall XR and even that spikes my fight or flight and gives me drastic mood swings throughout the day. The only one that kinda seemed to help me focus and didn't make me as anxious was the name brand Vyvanse... once the generic came out (and that's all my insurance will approve/cover) it stopped working. Generic Vyvanse now does the same thing to me as the others. I cant afford the name brand. Was also going to try Dyanavel but that's $100 a month because insurance won't cover it. I've tried eating a high protein breakfast prior to taking it, but that only helps for the first 1-2 hours or so. I do drink coffee and acknowledge that I need to try cutting my caffeine intake back.

Has anyone else had this experience? Can I just not tolerate stimulants at all because of my anxiety? I've considered asking about the non-stimulant meds for ADHD but I've heard a lot of negative experiences with those. 

I also take Propranolol as needed for my anxiety, which is necessary when I do take a stimulant. I'm scared to go back on any SSRI's due to past issues/reactions.

They do not even care about middle school girls molested for years by the teacher Turner while telling each of them that they are the only one complaining.

NO to Lisa Henry and Erin who are the season 2 of nodding ladies. The only two candidates who [refused to answer question how they will measure Rudolph's performance](https://youtu.be/XHZcBQcuaUU?t=1631) as they do not have any plan to.

NO to measure AA until new board is selected and does not consist of current boards puppets.

Last but not the least, recently Conley wrote the revised contract for Rudolph [""behind the scene""](https://youtu.be/Blr9O2tkeJc?t=17927) as mentioned by Chang. The following was posted by a parent in [MVWSDChat](https://groups.io/g/MVWSDChat) as a open letter to Conley

""Devon, since you mentioned registering to vote in your last post (attached to the end of this post), I was compelled to speak up. At the [June 13 board meeting this year](https://www.youtube.com/live/Blr9O2tkeJc?si=jVCvE6K3e2xDjBmu&t=17807), you and a few board members ""worked behind the scenes"" (as was said during the meeting) to extend the superintendent's contract, which was to **expire in June 2025**, for **another 4-year term which ends in June 2028**. This is after we all knew that there would be 3 vacancies on the board (and possibly 4, because you decided to run for the city council this year). Despite the pleas from quite a few parents and community members to let the 2024 board make that decision, the board majority voted to approve the contract. I am going to break down the ramification of this decision:

* There will be 3 or 4 new board members as a result of the November 2024 election. These new board members, if they stay for the full term, will serve until **November 2028**.
* The superintendent's contract was supposed to **expire in June 2025**, about 7 months after the new board takes over. 
* The right and honorable thing to do, in a fully functioning democracy, was for the current board to let the new board make a decision on whether to extend the superintendent's contract. After all, what was the rush? The May 2022 contract already stipulated a 3% salary increase until 2025 - not a far cry from the new 5% increase. There was no precedence for this either - I've checked the previous contracts and amendments: [2015-2018](https://www.mvwsd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_418774/File/Contract%202015-2018.pdf), [2018-2021](https://www.mvwsd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_418774/File/Contract%202018-2021.pdf), [2019-2021](https://www.mvwsd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_418774/File/Contract%202019-2021.pdf), [Adm. 1](https://www.mvwsd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_418774/File/Adm%201.pdf), [Adm. 2](https://www.mvwsd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_418774/File/Adm%202.pdf), [Adm. 3](https://www.mvwsd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_418774/File/Adm%203.pdf). The only time when the superintendent's contract was renewed early was in 2019 because the lucrative primary residence loan fringe benefit was added to his contract. Even then, the contract was only amended for a 3-year term. 
* The current board extended the contract **one full year before the contract expires,** with a **new 4-year term**, which now expires in **June 2028**. This means that for **3 years and 7 months,** i.e. **almost the entirety of their term**, the 3 or 4 newly elected board members would not be able to exercise their **only and most important hiring privileges and responsibilities.**  Yes, according to the June 13, 2019 contract, the board is always allowed to pursue termination with or without cause - both of which are lengthy, a tremendous burden (since it could involve hefty penalties), and totally unfair. In contrast, that same contract also states that non-renewal of contract is a much simpler process and carries no penalties.  Let me summarize this: **The current board, on June 13, 2024 took away the most important hiring privileges and responsibilities from the incoming 2024 board members until June 2028 (5 months before the end of their term)**. 
* During the meeting, the board did NOT address **the main concern** that was brought up: **the early extension**. [Trustee Blakely made a comment](https://www.youtube.com/live/Blr9O2tkeJc?si=ZUMpP3EunpIEVaIC&t=18998), but only to say that ratifying employment contracts at the end of fiscal year (June) was standard and that 4-year term contracts had been previously discussed - this totally missed the point. Nobody else made any comments to address the real issue brought up by the community.

Devon, this was NOT ""putting our children first"". The way I look at it, this was a **subversion of the democratic process**. On June 13, 2024 you and your fellow board members took power away from the people. That is **authoritarianism**.I hope the board is ready to finally answer to their constituents. I have already requested a CPRA request for records explaining the reasoning behind extending the superintendent's contract one year earlier for a 4 year term.I will also formally submit a request to the trustees to answer those same questions. **Fellow parents**: I encourage everybody who is concerned (whichever side of the aisle you are on) about the state of our local democracy to also submit a formal request.""

I've heard all the countless amazing benefits from going carnivore, but have experienced ZERO, and I wanted to check my blood levels after 6 months. After hearing it was normal to double or tipple testosterone in just a few months, and I've suffered from severely low testosterone levels since i was a teen.

I'm 29, and now 6 months and 2 days in on carnivore. NEVER slipped up. ZERO PLANTS, which also means ZERO coffee, sweetners, alcohol ext.

ONLY fatty meat, fish, eggs and dairy (zero milk, sometimes kefir, sour cream, but mostly cheese and real butter) Fatty meat is ALWAYS the main, and cheese or butter as condiment or desert

For 90% of the time, I've been basically ZERO carb

6 months blood levels from carnivore:
- FASTING INSULIN 44 - but was 5 on SAD
- B12 309 - But was high 800s on SAD
- TESTOSTERONE 11 - same on SAD

Exercised a few hours before i took the blood test at 9 in the morning, is this why my levels are so severe? 

This is severe. When i consumed the standard diet, which is nothing but poision, my B12 were high 800s which is what it should be, or more, but now 309 on carnivore, but below 400 is dangerously low, as in brain atrophy and permanent nerve and brain damage, and fasting insulin were 5, but now 44 on carnivore which is insulin resistance, as in severely high insulin. Test was the same as pre carnivore.

I eat until satiated every time, get my 8 hours, excercise 5 times a week (10 min bodyweight, 15 min boxing bag) low stress, NEVER eaten this much meat and fat in my life, as ive eaten severely small amounts of meat and fat all my life, like most, the amount of meat and fat I'm eating now is ungodly compared to the rest of my life.

I believe in carnivore and will NEVER consume even a gram or ml of plants again, because we are carnivores, the facts are all there, irrefutably, but these levels states that I'm in very poor health, as in severely high insulin (insulin resistant) and severely low B12. 

Questions:
1. Am i so severely insulin resistant that I can't digest and absorb the B12?,

2. Am I so severely insulin resistant that it's going to take me even longer to get my fasting insulin down to 5? Dr berg has said severe insulin resistance can take upnto a year to reverse.

3. And is it going to take me even longer for my T levels to double or tripple?

1fz70gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1fz70gu/i_called_cps_on_my_best_friend_of_23_years_and/,I called CPS on my best friend of 23 years and kicked her out of my wedding," I know this is a long story but after all of this I have to just get it off my chest. I (31f) have known/been best friends with, lets call her Anna (31 f), for 23 years. We met in 3rd grade and have been inseparable as children. Anna was always the more adventurous of the two of us while I was more level headed and shy. We both balanced each other out very well while growing up. As we grew up, we remained close and have seen each other through some hard times to say the least. I will not go into it all here (that is a long story) but to keep it short she fell hard into addiction of both alcohol and other substances and I supported her journey to sobriety. She was not always there for me during my times of need but with her actively trying to overcome addiction I did not always confide in her when I needed someone. I was too focused on helping her/didn’t want my issues to hinder her progress. 



She had been sober for over a year when she met the “love of her life” and had her child. She asked me to be his godmother and I of course said yes. My now husband (Keith, 32)  proposed to me right before the baby was born. He flew me to Italy and popped the question in front of the Colosseum. I am a history teacher. I teach about 100-200 students a year, and ancient civilizations is my nerdy thing so this was a dream come true in so many ways!  I was overwhelmed with love/excitement for my new god son and to plan a wedding with the love of my life. This was October of 2023. Soon after the baby arrived Anna’s relationship with the father of her child got rocky (he was a recovering addict to hard substances and relapsed) and she started drinking again. I unfortunately found that out later.



While wedding planning I asked Anna to be one of my bridesmaids. I did not ask her to be the maid of honor because I knew with a newborn she had a lot on her plate, and I am so glad I didn’t! After Christmas that year, I planned a weekend to go to the city and try on wedding dresses. Almost all of my bridesmaids, my mom, and MIL were going to be there because picking the right dress was a special moment for me. I have spent the majority of my life trying to help others so I, maybe selfishly, was excited to enjoy all of the big bridal moments where my now husband and I were celebrated. One of my best friends from college/part of the bridal party, Aiden (them/they 29), flew down from out of state to be there at the dress appointments. Aiden booked a nice hotel suite for us in the area where the dress shops were (I live about an hour away from the city) so I could enjoy a relaxing weekend during this big time and not worry about driving back and forth. 



The first night we were out enjoying dinner and I got a call from Anna, she sounded upset and said she got in a fight with the father of her child. We invited her to meet us at dinner to take her mind off of things. She showed up two hours later completely wasted and kept going back and forth to the bathroom to drink a bottle of wine that she hid in her large purse. I am surprised she drove to us in that state without hurting herself or anyone else on the road! She then threw up all over the nice hotel room Aiden got us and when she was sober enough to drive home, lost her car. I spent the majority of the night walking with her all over the city from parking garage to parking garage trying to find her car. When we found it she lost her money so I paid for her parking so she could leave. We had to cancel all of our plans that night to take care of her.



The next day she did not show up to the dress appointment, and honestly after seeing how terrible she was the night before I was a little relieved. She called later crying feeling bad that she missed the appointment. When I talked to her about it later she did not understand that she derailed the relaxing time Nadia and I had planned/ worried about her breaking her sobriety was more of my concern than missing the appointment. She promised this would not happen again, she would not let this relapse continue, and that she felt bad for dampening such a big moment for me. 



Fast forward a couple of months to my bridal shower and she had not RSVP yet. My mom was paying for the food and wanted to know if Anna and a few others who had not RSVP were coming so she could order enough. When I asked her if she was coming she got very defensive and asked me why I would think she would not come. I told her that was not the case and that my mom needed to know the food count since she did not RSVP. It was also on a day when she normally worked so I wanted to make sure. She then said she would never miss it for the world and she has never let me down before “except with the dress issue, but don’t hold that over my head”. Come the day of the shower she was nowhere to be found. Never showed up. I texted her after it was over and told her we missed her there and hoped she was okay. She called crying apologizing that she was at work and it completely slipped her mind. That she felt horrible, etc. 



Later in the summer my bridal party was getting my bachelorette weekend planned. I let them know I wanted a chill but fun weekend and I wanted the events to be flexible enough to where not everyone had to go to everything. I have several friends with newborns and wanted to be flexible for them. We discussed cute games/activites and maybe doing a cooking or pottery class together on top of one themed night. I just wanted to feel loved by my people. My bachelorette weekend was not great at all. We had a professional spa day (I loved that) and went to dinner. That was it…



I did not feel like much thought or love was put into that, not even weekend. No one really even discussed that I was getting married. I was crushed and shocked that my group of friends would do that after all of the surprises, parties, and events I planned for them out of love. The big kicker was that during our spa day, Anna had several sessions booked and did not show up. She did not answer anyone's calls or texts. I was so mad and upset that she would do this again. It left a bitter taste the rest of the weekend and I was ready to kick her out of the bridal party. 



At the end of the weekend her parents contacted me to let me know she tried to unalive herself and was in the hospital, that’s why she couldn’t come. I felt so guilty for being mad that she did not show when in reality she was really struggling. I cried for days. I later found out from my maid of honor that they had a lot more planned for the entire weekend but due to Anna’s addiction they changed almost everything at the last minute to accommodate her (because they knew how much I wanted her there) and everything else they tried to rebook was full until a much later date. My bridal party felt horrible and made it up to me later. I met with Anna at a coffee shop to make sure she was okay and asked if with everything going on she would rather come to the wedding as a guest. She sobbed when I suggested that and said she was getting the help she needed and would be extremely hurt if she was not in the wedding party. That she felt so guilty missing every single part of her best friend's wedding process and guilted me into keeping her in the wedding. I let her know that if she did not show for the rehearsal she was out and that was the only thing left before the actual wedding. 



Two weeks before the wedding she called upset saying she feared for her and her baby’s lives. The father of her child and her broke up, he relapsed on heavy drugs, and was sending her threatening messages (I personally saw them). This man had a history of terribly abusing his exs and knew where she was staying. She had applied to go to a home for women who struggle with addiction and their children but could not move in until the next week and had nowhere to go. Keith and I talked about it and agreed to let her and our god son (10 months old at the time) move in for the week. As much as I care about Anna, the only reason we agreed was because of the safety of the baby at that point. 



We gave her our bedroom and slept on an air mattress in the living room due to my 5 am wake up time for work. My husband worked from home and had his office set up in the living room. We did not want to wake the baby while getting ready. The first day was great! The second day Anna drove an hour away to her parents to get the rest of the baby's stuff and took the baby with her. When I got home from work she was still not back so I called her. She was crying and on the way back to our house from her parents. They had gotten into an argument about her leaving. I told her I would come get her and the baby if she was too upset to drive but she said she was okay and would see me in an hour. Two hours passed and nothing… 



She finally pulled into the driveway and Keith went outside to help carry in the big playpen while I set things up. He looked very concerned when he came in and told me I was going to be upset and he went to get the baby. Anna came in extremely drunk. I found out from her that she stopped at a gas station, bought a huge bottle of wine, and drank it in the car WHILE driving her and her baby back. She also spilled a good bit of it all over the car and on the baby’s things. You could smell the alcohol from over 5 feet away in the car. I was livid and seeing red at that point. Keith made sure the baby was safe while I let her have it. After everything that she has done I NEVER thought she would put her child in harm's way. She was very lucky that she, her child, and anyone else on the road was alive. At that point it was so late we made sure to get both her and the baby to bed while we made a plan for what to do. 



When I got to work the next day I called Child Protective Services to let them know what happened that night. I let them know she was enrolled in a program and safe house for mothers who struggle with addiction and would be moving in at the end of the week. They told me not to let her know I called so she would not run with the baby and for us to keep an eye on her and the baby while they started the investigation and they would follow up with the safe home to make sure she checks in. During the longest week of our lives, Anna started to spiral. She made our house disgusting, ruined our things, left uneaten food out on our bed/in the carpet, and we found her medicine scattered across our yard along with some of her clothes/random items. She also started talking about narcissists ruling the world/out to get her and she was connected directly to “god” who also is love. Keith and I were becoming more and more concerned and secretly talked to her parents about what was happening in case we needed help. She also focused on how her parents were “out to get her” and working with “the narcissists who ruled the world against her”. 



Thursday of that week I came home extremely late from work. The school I was working at had several active shooter threats so I spent my day comforting crying 11 year olds who were afraid for their lives and trying to make them feel safe/loved. When I got home Anna came up to me very excited and let me know that the home had a room open for her and the baby and they could move in first thing the next morning instead of  Saturday like originally planned! We were all very excited and she thanked me for helping them out/being the best “sister” she has ever had. She then asked if I could watch the baby for about 3 hours so she could drive up to get the rest of the baby's stuff from her parents house. She said she felt bad but they had to go so early to complete paperwork, she would not have time to go before moving in in the morning. I let her know that I would but that she had to be back asap and she could not spend the night at her parents. Both Keith and I used up all of our days off for the wedding next week and could not miss any days or we would be fired. She said of course and that she would never do that to us then she left.



She called 10 minutes later saying she ran out of gas and was on the side of the road so Keith went and put gas in her car while I watched the baby. When he came back he told me it was odd that she passed several gas stations and did not stop before running out of gas but he was glad she was going to get the help she needed. He also said she told him that day while I was at work how bad she has felt about how she has treated me in the past. That I never gave up on her even when she was selfish, manipulative in addiction, and was not there for me like she should have been. How she wanted to show her appreciation and how much she loves me. It made me feel better and happy she was getting help the next morning and to be honest I was relieved to have our house back to normal. I put the baby to bed and accidentally fell asleep. I was woken up at 3 am to a crying baby and realized Anna wasn’t back.



Keith and I called and texted her but got no response. I called her parents and they let me know she never made it up to them. At that point we and her parents were both freaking out thinking she stopped to drink and was dead on the side of the road. Anna had the only car seat so her parents had to wait until the stores opened to get one then come down for the baby. I called the police to file a missing persons report/explain what happened then called my boss. Thankfully he understood and used a sick day for me to handle what was going on. Keith’s boss on the other hand was not as understanding and let him know they would have a meeting on Monday to discuss his employment. 



Two police officers came by the house to get details of Anna/her car and the situation. When explaining to them what happened one pointed out that Keith, as a man of color, might be the last person to have seen her alive. This caused Keith to panic while the other officer checked the gas station cameras to see him leave while Anna was still there and sort of fussed at the other officer for causing unnecessary panic. They told us to stop texting/calling her because if she did relapse somewhere or someone stole her phone they might get rid of it and could not trace it. They also said not to respond to anything she sent us and to let them know if/when she contacts us. Before the police left they let me know they were going to call when they traced her location and to call them if she shows back up. They needed to physically see her to remove her from the missing person list. Just 30 minutes later the police called me and let me know Anna had driven 3 hours away to another state. With the location they gave me I knew she probably went to see an ex boyfriend of hers and I was furious. She essentially abandoned her 10 month old with us to do who knows what! When her parents made it to our house I got a text stating 

“I’m safe and good. I’m on my way back and I completely overslept. I’m so sorry. I should have set an alarm. Please don’t call the police or my parents. I’m coming to get the baby and we are going to the safe house. Please please please let me get my stuff and my son.  I’m so sorry I lied. I needed a break. I went to my friend Rob’s house and then I overslept. Please give me this last chance… I love you both and I’m sorry for my behavior.”



I did not respond and let the police know. We decided to wait for her to arrive at the house and call the police for help like they requested. When she got there she was extremely high and intoxicated. There was visible alcohol and drugs in her front seat. While waiting for the police to come we tried to explain to her that she was on the missing persons list so we needed to wait for the police to come and see her to check her off. We were also not trying to upset her so she would not run before the police got there. She saw her parents inside and started yelling and screaming at them. She then went to attack her father in front of the baby and Keith had to hold her back and remove her from the house while I made sure the baby was safe. At that point she was yelling barefoot in our yard and the neighbors started coming out to see what was going on. It was quite a show! The police arrived and calmed her down. They then in a nutshell told us it was our responsibility to get her 45 minutes away to the safe house and to call them back if she tries to attack anyone again, then left. Keith, her parents, and I managed to get her up there although it was a nightmare and took the entire day. A couple of days later I had a conversation with her telling her I was done and not to even show up to the wedding. What hurt the most was honestly the fact that she had that conversation to Keith about what all she had done in the past and then a couple of hours lied to, manipulated us, and put our futures at risk. I found out from her parents she got kicked out of the safe house a couple of days later and that they thankfully have the baby. Her parents thanked us and said honestly if we did not take them in their grandson might not have been alive.

I have tinder and place myself in various UK cities to swipe abroad but curious if there's a more popular app or site I can use.

# I absolutely love an English, Scottish or Irish accent. I consume a lot of UK film and TV and love stand up comedy. I'm finding that I'm not having a lot in common with American guys. I'm a hopeless romantic that would love to have an adventure abroad. 

# Most of my friends are married but no one seems to have any single friends that they can set me up with. I'm learning too many guys I match with are Trumpers or don't want to actually date and get to know someone. Or they are looking to start an affair, no thanks. Lately, I've had a handful of upsetting first meeting conversations where ""I owe them something"" for meeting up and buying me a coffee or a drink. 



# I'm a nice, fun person that is seeking genuine connection and more love in my life. IDK I just have better conversations with my matches in England and Scotland and Ireland and they are like ""too bad you aren't here."" But I can be! I need more banter, more playfulness in my life. I'd take any excuse to visit. 

# I'm coming to London in March to attend a couple of Off Menu podcast live shows. I love James Acaster and Larry Dean. I just saw John Bishop here in Boston recently and have tickets to Romesh for when he comes to Boston. I'm currently obsessed with Gangs of London. Taskmaster is the best. After a recent move, I learned I've got a decent TARDIS collection going (10th Doctor obvi). 



# I'm 38, have a good job and 2 dogs. I've been getting into rugby and try to catch matches when they are available over here. I don't know what's happening most of the time but love it. My perfect day is sex, coffee, a nice walk/work out, boozy brunch and TV/Movie marathon and more sex. A lifetime ago I was trying to be a stand up/comedy writer and still love it. I love a disaster movie, a snowstorm and walking around a city listening to music or a podcast.

Forget all those ""get rich quick"" schemes, cryptocurrency scams, and NFTs of celebrity feet—I've got the real deal. It’s called Alignerr, the world’s best AI training company that’s definitely not running a data farm in someone's garage. Nope, not at all.

So, here’s the thing. Six months ago, I was like you: poor, sad, and questioning if I could sell a kidney on the dark web to pay rent. Then, Alignerr slid into my inbox like, ""Hey, wanna make money training AI to be smarter than you?” And, well, when opportunity knocks, you answer, even if it's wearing Crocs and smells like expired cheese.

Now, you might be wondering, ""What kind of work does Alignerr offer?"" Oh, let me tell you—it’s elite. I started off with their AI Calibration projects, which is basically just you staring at a screen for 18 hours labeling images of squirrels in hats versus ferrets with bad haircuts. They call it “data labeling,” but honestly, I think it’s just an art form. Anyway, I got really good at it. Like, too good.

Fast forward six weeks, and Alignerr promoted me to their ""VIP Data Squad,"" which is just me and a guy named Greg, who I’m 90% sure is an AI pretending to be human. He keeps mentioning his “love for sunlight” and “breathing air” like a robot who just Googled how to fit in.

But here’s the real magic—Alignerr pays in Alignerr Bucks, which you can redeem on Thursdays between 2:37 and 2:39 AM for gift cards to their exclusive merch shop. I used mine to buy a hoodie that says, “I Heart AI (but it’s watching me)” and a coffee mug that screams when I pour hot liquid in it.

So yeah, if you’re tired of your boring 9-5 and want to make money labeling robot faces while questioning reality, DM me for a referral. Just remember: once you're in, don’t ask why Greg always hums the Windows startup sound.

I've been alone a lot. Been single for most of the last 15 years in fact. But lately I've been meeting more like-minded people. I've planned to meet a woman for a coffee on Thursday. She's a similar age to me, beautiful, intelligent, studying an MA in the arts looks to have a bright future ahead. And despite this date being arranged I long to end my life.

I also met a fascinating woman on a train journey a couple of days ago. We really hit it off and exchanged numbers. Maybe nothing will come of it. But that's two people I've met, maybe one of them will, you know, be the one.

I moved up from 1.0 because my insurance will only cover more than 2 months if I’m getting one of the two maintenance doses (1.7 or 2.4). My doctor told me it sounds like I have acid reflux and had me start Pepcid twice a day. It helped quite a bit for a few days but now I’m feeling lousy again. I’m choosing fairly low acid meals but still have one cup of coffee with milk in the morning. Everything I used to eat just fine now seems to be a problem.

I don’t want to go off the meds and I don’t want to keep feeling sick. The doctor wants me to keep taking the shot every week so that my body continues to adjust to 1.7. Ive taken 5 doses and it only seems to be getting worse.

So what to do? Skip a dose to feel better? Give up on Wegovy now that I’ve reached my goal?

We talk for a month almost daily. Lots of great conversations (naughty ones too) and had a couple of lunch coffees in my neighbourhood (her office is super close) and one great date at the museum followed by a great night. We both know that we are seeing other people and it we are okay with it. We have a second date scheduled on a Saturday for a concert before heading back to mine.

On Friday she has been a bit sick throughout the week. We texted late afternoon and seeing something funny online I took a screenshot and sent it to her. No reply but it does not concerns me: I have friends coming over so we did not texted further that evening. The next day I sent a text which she saw but did not replied too. Day goes by and knowing she had some activity with her partner and friends I do not engage in texting. I send another text 2 hours before the show to confirm the meeting point and go meet with friends. As I am walking 20 minutes before the show to the venue I receive a text from one of her two Instagram accounts we have been texting with saying: “don’t wait for me tonight”. I immediately texted back “what do you mean?”

As I continue walking something seems off and I look back at our conversation and the screenshot and realized to my horror that as I took it i received a very explicit message from another person that shows on the top of the screen. I sent her a message on her two insta and a text apologizing for the screenshot that was not an intentional error, saying that as much as I don’t think seeing/sexting other people is an issue in our dynamics I can understand this must have been not pleasant to see and that no matter the direction we take from this I hope that we can at least have a conversation. 

No replies and the text remains unread on both insta tho I am not blocked since I can still see the accounts. She has not posted any stories too which is a bit unusual (tho no a serial poster she used to put stuff frequently).

I knew the moment I saw she messaged me that it wouldn't be good. I haven't seen or talked to this women in over a decade. She was in the YW presidency with my Mom when I was in YW and I was good friends with her daughter. I spent time at their house and she often drove me places for church activities and seminary. 

I opened the message and it was a reel from the end excerpt of Brad Wilcox's talk at conference. Pleading with the youth to not trade in their eternal glory for a bowl of pottage and to not give up everything. 

I was immediately triggered. First, I didn't watch conference, except for OuterDankness's stories but I knew the main messaging. Lots of rhetoric about those who lose their faith. I was immediately triggered because of all the reels to send me she had to send one of Brad Wilcox speaking and two....just what he said was sooo offensive. This lady hasn't messaged me or spoken to me in YEARS. Somehow she found out about me leaving the church and instead of checking in and using her own words to talk to me she sends me this bullshit reel and tells me ""sending with love""

Next, and I'm not sure if this response was appropriate...But i messaged her back and said ""I'm sorry, I'm not feeling the love and please do not send this content to me again."" Then, I blocked her. 

I headed to work and as I was talking to my supervisor I couldn't hold in the tears. She was sooo good and let me take some time to pull myself together. I ended up calling my Mom crying and explaining to her what happened and my response. My Mom was sooooo good. She knows this woman and even though they are friends it has always been in the relationship of my mom being more of the mature friend in the relationship. 

She also knows I've never had respect for this women. I explained to my mom that I felt so triggered because it is hard to feel as I've left the church that there are people who feel I have essentially lost everything and that I have thrown my eternal glory away and am left with nothing. I explained that what this woman did was inappropriate and highly immature. She agreed with me and validated me and apologized that this happened. She is TBM by the way. It was an emotional phone call and now I'm left wondering since I've calmed down if I overreacted?

Looking back, I wish I had the emotional capacity/maturity at the time to just let it go. But I'm in such a hard place right now with my deconstruction that I just couldn't. And I felt my mom needed to know what happened in case this friend brings it up. I hate the feeling of setting boundaries....and I wonder if I'm even doing it appropriately. I'm in the point of my deconstruction that I feel angry and resentful and I want nothing to do with Mormonism. But yet I have TBM family and friends....and they have no idea what I actually feel or am going through. So moments like this with my mom...I wonder if she sees me as overreacting...but if she does she still sided with me and expressed her unconditional love. 

I've never dealt with feelings of being ""triggered"" and putting up boundaries as the people in my life (all mormon) have always validated me because I was TBM. But now, leaving the church...well you all know what that is like..its the hardest process I've ever gone through.

so i’ve been in a pretty severe depressive episode for like. months. partly circumstantial, partly went on olanzapine and it made me a zombie. went off it a couple months ago and felt more alive/less numb but still SEVERELY depressed. just like constant waves of hopelessness and mild to moderate SI every day. 

once i went off the olanzapine i had horrible insomnia but eventually figured out a good combo of meds (upped gabapentin, added melatonin) to help me sleep and have been sleeping fine or sometimes too much. anyway last night i accidentally stayed up reading anything i could find out about the titanic on reddit until 3am. i felt so awake and woke up at 7am still feeling so awake and kind of buzzy. however i drank coffee yesterday which i don’t often do. 

i’m not talking a lot or v fast and just feel kind of bored w everything, still kinda hopeless but that may have to do with circumstances. struggling to pay attention to work and i thought if i was hypomanic i’d be more goal oriented but am really really struggling with basic hygiene and self care.

does any of this sounds like it could possibly be hypo? i haven’t been hypo in years so i don’t remember. god everything is just so boring 

i’m also just soooo afraid bc i mostly get mixed episodes so i’ll be hypo for a couple hours and then everything will be so so so so scary ",1,1728411472.0,BipolarReddit,1,1.0,False

I consider myself reasonably intelligent, have enough money to pay my own way, can hold down a decent conversation. I’m not hideous, maybe a bit fat (US size 10) but pretty healthy and active. 

I’m not desperate for love, I have a happy life with lots of friends and family who do that for me. But it would be nice to feel wanted, desired, maybe even pretty. But all the guys I’ve met online are only after a f**k buddy, they don’t even want to get a cup of coffee - just ‘come to my house’

I’m over that. I enjoy sex, sure, but not with complete strangers. Also id like to think I could find someone who thinks I’m worth just a little bit of effort. I don’t want to be wooed and swept off my feet but maybe an actual date would be nice? Dinner and allowing things to develop organically? 

There is just nothing. Most of the guys my age on the apps want to date 25 year old supermodel types which I am not. 

Am I just wasting my time? Am I too old and fat for a love life now? Is the time for dates and effort and energy totally behind me? Is it easier to give up and just stay at home with my cat?",3,1728411221.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

The parent who did this past month offered a really cute Stationary Station with fun pens, sticky notes, paperclips etc that the teachers could help themselves to. 

  
What would YOU want to see in the teachers lounge as an informal but still special ""Thank You"" for helping us shape our kids? Coffee? Self care stuff? I don't really know what my budget would/should be. I'm open to all possibilities and options and just want to make sure it's actually wanted and useful. Thanks in advance!
