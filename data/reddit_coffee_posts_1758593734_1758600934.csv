Well after 5 mins I asked if it was still working and it said I paused waiting for you.

So I said if you couldn’t do it then why suggest it? Then it went into those annoying apologizes how it let me down blah blah blah. So we go in a different direction . It suggests it animate a coffee pot pouring coffee in a cup blah blah blah . It creates  still of the cup. Then a still with a tipped coffee pot but the background changes.

1no7jnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1no7jnn/the_great_dishwasher_debate_of_apartment_4b/,The Great Dishwasher Debate of Apartment 4B,"I swear, for a minute there, I thought I was gonna lose it. It was 7 AM, I was running late for my internship, and the sink – *the entire sink* – was overflowing with what looked like a week's worth of dishes. Crusted-on pasta, suspicious cereal bowls, a pan that might have once held scrambled eggs. I literally stared at it, frozen, a silent scream building in my chest. This wasn't just a messy kitchen; this was a personal attack on my morning routine, a gauntlet thrown by the universe, or more accurately, by my three otherwise amazing roommates in Apartment 4B.

There’s Maya, the grad student who’s always studying, always a bit absent-minded. Then there’s Chloe, the freelance graphic designer whose schedule is as chaotic as her creative process. And finally, Ben, the software engineer who somehow manages to cook elaborate meals but apparently forgets how to load a dishwasher. We’re all in our mid-twenties, trying to adult in this pricey city, and mostly, it works. We have a shared Google Sheet for bills, a whiteboard for groceries, and a no-loud-music-after-10 PM rule that everyone (mostly) respects. But the dishwasher? That was our Achilles' heel.

It wasn't even about *washing* the dishes, no cap. It was about who emptied it. The unwritten rule was: if you take a clean dish, you unload the whole thing. Simple, right? Apparently not. I’d walk in to find a single, solitary clean mug on the drying rack, meaning someone had taken one item and dipped. Chloe had left a passive-aggressive Post-it note once, ""Dishwasher fairies don't exist,"" which honestly, just made it worse because then *no one* wanted to touch it out of spite. The tension was getting highkey ridiculous.

I ended up just rinsing my coffee cup and leaving for work, seething. Later that day, I was venting to my friend, ""I'm dead, I'm gonna snap. I can't live like this."" But then, I had an idea. I got home, and instead of confronting them, I just... started loading *everything* into the dishwasher. Not a word. Just me, headphones on, meticulously scraping, rinsing, stacking. Maya walked in, saw me, and her eyes got wide. She quietly started helping. Then Ben came in, looking guilty as heck, and he started putting away the clean dishes from the previous load that had been sitting there all morning. Chloe arrived last, saw us, and just sighed. ""Okay, fine,"" she said, ""I get it. We suck.""

We ended up having a proper sit-down that night, over some takeout. No yelling, no blame game. Just a real conversation. I explained how it stressed me out, Maya admitted she often didn't even notice the full dishwasher until she needed something specific, Ben confessed he just hated doing it and procrastinated, and Chloe said she felt like she was always the one doing it. We decided on a rotating schedule, not for washing, but for *unloading*. A simple chart on the fridge, initialed when done. It felt so obvious once we talked it out, but it took one person (me, I guess) to just quietly do the thing that needed doing. Now, a week in, the sink is clear. We're still figuring out the nuances, but it’s a start. And honestly, it feels good knowing we can actually tackle these small bumps together.

Obligated this is a throwaway, I don't want this reaching friends or family. Also, I'm sorry for the length. I didn't know a good way to shorten this without leaving out anything important. 

I was directed here upon the advice of a friend, after this issue escalated to a huge argument (approx. 3 hours ago) that resulted in myself leaving our home to go to a buddy's house. I am still here, and unsure how to go about resolving this with my wife. 

Myself (28m) and my wife (26m) have been together for 10 years, and married for 4 of those. My wife is pregnant with our first child, a boy, and she is due in early July. Now onto the issue that has arisen. 

My wife wants to name our son after her brother, who passed a little over a year ago. Her brother, we'll call him T, was her only sibling and they were very close growing up, as they were only 2 years apart. However, her brother was not the most pleasant person. Her brother was a drug addict starting from age 14-15, he stole from everyone around him including myself and my wife, he was abusive to everyone of his partners and his child, and he served several years behind bars. T was also abusive to my wife, and her parents. He had a stay away order from our home because he broke in while we were away and stole our TV, my wife's jewelry box, and one of my hunting rifles. 

T passed last year in April from a drug overdose, and it affected my wife very deeply. It was her first major loss she has suffered, and she still attends therapy to help cope. 

When we found out we were having a boy, she immediately wanted the name to be T's name. I heavily disagreed, and I have offered many replacements, other family names like her father or grandfathers, but she will not budge. She wants our son to have the exact same name as her brother, first and middle. She has even gone as far to say that if we name him something else she will have it changed, or only call him by T. 

My final straw was when my wife ordered a blanket with T's name sewn into it for our son. I blew up, and I told her I was not naming our child after a drug addict who took advantage of everyone around him. My wife blew up at me, she screamed at me to leave, threatened to call the police if I didn't, she called me a piece of shit for talking about her dead brother like he was trash. I did leave, I told her I would attempt to speak to her again about this once we had both calmed down, and I apologized for speaking about T in a negative way. I'm getting calls nonstop from her family, calling me names for speaking about T and not wanting to honor him by naming our son after him. My family is on my side, her family is on her side, and my friends are split on the matter. 

So Reddit, strangers on the internet, I need your opinion on if I am indeed a massive asshole for not wanting this name for our child? 

TLDR; wife wants to name son after brother who was a drug addict and serial abuser, I do not. We cannot come to reason with one another, huge argument ensued. 

&#x200B; 

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE** 

&#x200B; 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/w6o01j/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_name_our_son_after/)  **July 24, 2022 (3 months later)** 

Hello internet humans, not sure if any of you remember my first post a few months back but I just logged on and saw I had a few messages so I figured I would post an update, sorry in advance for the length. 

So, if you recall in my first post, me and my wife were expecting a baby boy in early July, and our conflict was occurring over my wife wanting to name our son after her late brother. We got into a huge fight, some names were called and threats were made, and I was led to this subreddit to ask advise and opinions of internet strangers. 

Well, a week after the post I sat down with my wife and we had a very long and difficult conversation. She broke down and admitted she was struggling more than she let on with the loss of her brother, and she told me she felt uncomfortable talking to me about it due to my feelings towards him and how he lived his life. I was devastated to say the least, I have never felt like such a horrible partner. I was selfish, I failed to see him as anything more than his mistakes, and I failed to support my wife through his death. It was a long talk with lots of tears, and we both agreed to be more open in the future and less judgmental. We started attending therapy together less than two weeks after that, and we have been going ever since once a week. It was rough at first, but it has helped tremendously in dealing with the bumps in the road of marriage. 

As for our son... we came to an agreement on a name after lots of long discussion, a first name we both adored and her brothers middle name, just spelled differently. A good compromise for both of us, and it was my sons own name that no one before him had carried, we were both happy. 

Then on July 3rd, 2022, my wife delivered a beautiful, healthy, 8lb baby GIRL! To say that we were shocked would be an understatement. My daughter came home the next day, and since then I am still in awe of how we created something so perfect. We didn't figure out a name until she was a week old, but I am happy to share that Eleanor Shae is what we came up. We are still adjusting to life with an infant, but so far it has been nothing short of amazing. 

Thank you for your past advice internet friends and strangers. 

TLDR; Wife & I made up, went to therapy, found a name that was a compromise and we loved for our son, had a surprise baby girl instead, we are overjoyed.

[My wife is cheating on me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/s/30J3kN6Wsh)  **July 19, 2023 (1 year after 1st update)**


I am just here to vent my frustrations and scream into the void about my current situation. I can’t talk to anyone in my personal life about this. My wife is cheating on me. My wife is cheating and she has been for the past two months. 

I just don’t understand? I don’t even know where to start to begin to understand. We have a beautiful home, stable careers, we’re not financially struggling, no drug or alcohol abuse, we attend therapy together. Our daughter is healthy, perfect. Our 6 year wedding anniversary is 3 months from tomorrow. We’ve been together 11 years. I have spent the last two days examining everything about us under a microscope, trying to find a crack. Where I went wrong, when did she become unhappy, when did this life, OUR LIFE, become unsatisfactory for her?? For her to step outside of our marriage with some random guy she met on facebook?? For her to throw our family away? I just don’t understand.  

I found out on Monday, completely by chance. My daughters tablet was dead, I grabbed my wife’s iPad so she could watch her night time videos and go to sleep. Wife isn’t home right now, she’s on a trip and won’t be back for another 4 days. I keep hearing message notifications dinging on her iPad while my daughter has it, so I took it to turn it on silent only to see a mans name I didn’t recognize with a little winky face next to it. I went through EVERYTHING. They’ve done it all, met up, spent the night together, went on dates, they even have a romantic cruise planned for next month! The same cruise she told me was a bachelorette trip with one of her friends. All of these outings that I ENCOURAGED. She told me they were with friends, I encouraged her! I was so proud she was getting out there and becoming more social, since she expressed motherhood made her feel like a recluse. And after digging a little deeper, all of these new “friends” she’s been out with don’t even exist. All lies. They are characters she’s created to continue her relationship with this man. 

I feel like a complete and total idiot. I never second guessed a lie she fed me. I gave her my 100% trust. We’ve been doing couples therapy for a year, we communicate, we go on dates, we get each other gifts, our sex life was great, I never not even for a second would have suspected this. I don’t know how to confront her with this, I don’t want this. I don’t want to split up our home. But I know that this isn’t something therapy can fix, I know myself well enough to know I’ll never be able to trust her again. Do I just let go? Let her go be with this man who clearly makes her happier than I can? My entire existence is intertwined with her, how do I even begin to untangle that and separate? I have 4 more days to sit and overthink this. I genuinely don’t know whChina man?

**ADDITIONAL INFO**

>Thank you everyone for the advice. I am trying to keep up with comments, and eventually will reply to everyone. Since posting and reading the comments I’ve been working on getting all the messages/pictures/videos into a folder on my personal computer. I went through our home cameras and found that she’s had him at our house several times, either picking her up or them swimming(amongst other things) in our pool together. The more I find the sicker I feel. I have a lot of phone calls to make in the next few days. And an appointment to get screened for STIs. I do want everyone to rest assured my daughter is mine. We had a DNA test done when she was an infant to scan for hereditary diseases I carry. I’m going to reach out to my parents and fill them in so they can babysit while I handle this for the next few days.

[My wife is cheating on me, continued.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/s/ViOxS27s98)  **Aug 14, 2023 (1 month after last update)** 

I posted here almost a month ago venting my frustrations about discovering my wife’s affair, and I received a magnitude of comments and messages filled with advice and kind words. For that I thank everyone who took the time to comment or write me, and I’m sorry for anyone who related to my situation. I’m here with somewhat of an update, but mostly more venting. My life is upside down and it feels good to get it all out somewhere. Sorry if a lot of this is rambling, and sorry for the length. 

After making my post, I took the advice of everyone and gathered up all evidence and contacted lawyers in my area. I found a really great one and went ahead and started on divorce papers before my wife got home. I also got tested for any STIs, and told my parents/best friend about the situation. I took my daughter to my parents so I could have the alone time to mentally prepare myself to face my wife with this discovery. I rage cleaned a lot, and cried a lot those last two days before she got back. I packed some of her stuff, but then unpacked it and cried more. I had it planned to lay out all the screenshots along with divorce papers on our dining room table and just sit and wait for her, but I didn’t get the chance to do that. 

She was supposed to get home later in the afternoon on Sunday, but she ended up getting back around 6:30 that morning, she didn’t call or text in hopes of surprising me. I was up drinking coffee, and you guessed it, crying, when she walked into the house. I didn’t greet her, I just went and got the folders of evidence and divorce papers and gave them to her. I don’t remember anything she said that day, but I just said I knew, I wanted a divorce, and I would keep the house as it was in my name solely. It hurt a lot, I wanted to hug her, but also scream at her. Lots of tears from her, lots of yelling at me, I didn’t say anything. I told her we could discuss it at length with lawyers present once she accepted the situation and calmed down. I think someone called it “grey wall” in the comments of my last post, not entirely sure but I tried my best to do that and not show emotion/argue with her. It was really hard, hardest thing I hope I’ll ever have to do. She betrayed me, but I still felt awful making her cry. 

She left that day with some clothes/personal belongings and went to her parents, and my parents and best friend came to stay with me and my daughter. I had my lawyer arrange a meeting between us to discuss custody/belongings/money/everything else that following Tuesday. Well, Monday I got a call from my clinic to come in to review results of STI tests, and as it turns out her parting gift to me is HSV-2. I cannot describe in words how angry, sad, shattered I am. I’m still accepting it, I don’t think I have yet, but I am working on it. I know it’s common, very common, it’s not going to kill me, but it doesn’t make it suck any less. I joined a support group on Facebook, those people are great. 

Going into Tuesday with that knowledge was awful. I felt so much shame bringing that up in-front of not only her, but both of our lawyers. I knew if I tried to discuss it with her privately it wouldn’t go well, not with the amount of anger/sadness I had in my system. She never apologized, she was a different person that day. I felt like I was looking into the eyes of a complete stranger, no emotion whatsoever. Divorce wise everything is cut and dry. We separated finances, the house is mine, we are just waiting the 90 days for it to finalize. There were no objections on her end but one, she wants to terminate her parental rights over our daughter. I say “wants,” she IS terminating rights, at-least trying to. She doesn’t want her anymore. Our daughter, our baby. I was fucking blindsided. I’m still blindsided. My daughter is 1, but she loves her mama. Mama was her first word. She is ONE. It’s been 3 weeks, and the pain I have felt, the pain for my daughter, for my family, has been indescribable. 

I don’t know who she is anymore, I don’t know what changed or when it changed but it terrifies me. I feel like my entire life was pulled out from under me. I haven’t talked to her, per lawyers advice and my own fear of what I would say. She hasn’t seen our daughter, she told me that day she didn’t want to. She didn’t want any pictures from our home, any memories. Just her clothes and electronics. I don’t understand any of it, I don’t think I ever will. We have to go to court for her petition to terminate rights, and I don’t want to look at her. I just can’t accept this as reality right now, not after everything. I’m trying as hard as I possibly can to keep a positive outlook on everything and be strong for my family and my baby, but this has been so hard. I hope a year from now I can look back and say “I survived that,” but right now it feels impossible to even see next week. I’m not suicidal, so don’t take it as that, I’m just emotionally, mentally, physically demolished. Absolutely demolished.

[This is a happy update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/s/FX27BE1ZGO)  **Apr 25, 2024 (8 months after last update)**


Hi there, for anyone who has messaged me and the loads of comments I have received regarding my past venting on this account, apologies first off. I genuinely kinda forgot I had it! Not much of a Reddit guy, but I’ve been getting into tiktok lately and saw a video about a super depressing Reddit story, and remembered my own super depressing Reddit story lol. 

It’s been around 8ish months since I posted here about my upside down situation, and a LOT of people messaged me in that time wanting to know how I was and what unfolded, and I really appreciate you strangers for all the kind messages. It genuinely means a lot, and I’m sorry I haven’t replied or anything, my life has been such a whirlwind these past few months! It’s hard to believe that was that long ago. 

To sum up the sad stuff, first off my divorce was finalized without any hiccups or hold ups, I’m still in the works of trying to sell our old house but in the meantime we moved to a new state. My ex is still in the process of petitioning for termination of parental rights, I’ve only seen her 3 times since moving and it has been to fly out for court. I was granted temporary full custody in the process, per her request and suggestion, and she was not mandated any visitation and has denied any offer of it. She has not seen my daughter in 7 months, she has requested not to. I don’t know what else she’s been up to or if she is still with her boyfriend or not, since the divorce it has been in best interest of my mental health to keep the contact as minimal as possible, and she has done the same. I have offered many chances for her to visit with my daughter, whether it be video call or flying out, and before we moved I asked weekly but it was always a no. Her parents still video call with my daughter and we’re hoping they can fly out over summer and spend some time with her. They’ve been cut off by my ex as well. I’m not sure what changed, but I can’t change it back, and I am accepting it mostly. I wish her well in all future endeavors. 

Now for the happy stuff that has happened! Firstly, I am a proud Arizonan now! Never saw myself moving here, but we have loved it so far. My parents packed up and came with us and I don’t think I’ve ever seen them so happy. My daughter is doing AMAZING. She will be 2 years old in July, and she is the smartest, funniest toddler I’ve ever met! She knows her ABCs, can count to 20 without help, loves animals and bugs especially, she thinks farts and a cow mooing are the definition of comedy, and she doesn’t know but she has been my biggest motivator to heal from this whole ordeal and be my best self. Like I genuinely don’t know how I helped make such an awesome kid, the more her personality grows the more in awe I am of just how cool she is. I could talk for days about her, so I’ll cap it here before this ends up being a Harry Potter length post lol. 

As for myself, I’m in therapy and have been throughout these 8 months, and I’m in a much better headspace. I’m working on getting back on-top of my health as I did put on about 30 stress pounds, I’ll get there eventually but I’m not sweating it too much. I have not dated or tried to, I don’t think I will anytime soon. I’ve adjusted to being a single parent pretty okay for the most part, I credit that to my family and friends more than anything because they have been a huge support system throughout this. There are still really hard moments that have happened and I know there are more to come, but I will roll with it just as I have this and hope to come out on top. This is not the end of the world for me even if it feels/felt like it in the moment. The sun will rise tomorrow, birds will chirp, and all will be well. Thanks to my therapist for that, those two sentences have helped me IMMENSELY. 

Sorry this ended up being so long, I should really pick up journaling. Maybe a blog or something lol. But thank you again to everyone who took the time to give me advice in the hardest time of my life, and thanks again if you read this. I genuinely appreciate it. 

**NEW UPDATE**

[It gets better.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/s/JpqZ9b3bFU)  **July 18, 2025 (15 months after last update)**

My post history sums up the utter hell I went through a while ago. Kind of just posting as a response to messages and an update. Despite everything I am well. 

I haven’t logged into this account in a while as I also almost completely forgot about it, but I saw through my email notifications I had a quite a few messages, so I popped in to check. Mostly people wanting updates regarding my ex and asking how I’m doing. Thank you, firstly, to all the kind strangers who sent very positive and uplifting messages. I apologize for not responding to everyone at the time.

As far as my ex is concerned, it has been total silence. I stopped sending pictures/updates on my daughter a few months ago as they weren’t responded to, and I wasn’t mandated to. Our custody case/her petition is still in limbo with the court system back in her state, so we are still under the original order from our divorce. I do not know what she is up to or what her personal life entails. Her parents still come for visits with my daughter and talk regularly with her, but as far as my ex goes they are about as in the dark as I am. I wish her well.

Yes, I still love Arizona. I have nice neighbors, my daughter has a lot of friends in daycare, and my parents are also doing great. I switched careers in November, took a little bit of a pay cut but I’m home earlier and I have a lot of very friendly co-workers. Our dog is doing well, and yes she grew out of chewing! We actually adopted a cat in March of this year and they’ve become great pals, and my daughter adores him. My daughter is thriving, she is smart, funny, loving, and creative. She loves animals, swimming, all things Bluey, and she has recently developed a strong appreciation for Dolly Parton and every song she sings lol.

Yes, I’m still in therapy, and I’m doing really well! I have accepted the past for what it is and mostly moved forward. It hasn’t come easy, and I know there are going to be difficult conversations in the future, but right now things are good. I have been trying to put more effort into my physical health, and I have been testing out different hobbies that align with my schedule and give me something to do that I enjoy. I do not enjoy hiking or running. No, I’m not dating. I don’t have the time or desire right now, and I am okay with that. Maybe one day, when I feel more stable, and more comfortable introducing anyone into my daughters life. But for right now, she needs stability more than I need a girlfriend.

I think that about sums it up for anyone curious or checking in. Not much substance but I appreciate my boring life these days lol. This is a post that is pretty much a synopsis of my journal, but it feels nice to have it out somewhere for people to see. My situation sucked, and now its better, a LOT better. I hope anyone else going through dark times can make it out on top and relatively unscathed. And if anyone is currently going through dark times, please feel free to reach out.

My NP almost had to remind us.,"Amy and I are one day away from our 9 year anniversary and thanks to Google Calendar, I got the reminder and told Amy that I saw it. I told my partner, Betsy and they said, ""if you didn't say something, I was gonna remind you both in our group chat.""

We've been so mentally swamped - Amy with her new job that has her traveling everyday and her ADHD memory, and my taking on and starting new projects at work, plus fighting down my own autistic burnout, while we both gave support and chipped in at each other's homes. 

We had a good laugh about it since we've also made a lot of time for each other in the last few months, knowing schedules could get weird.

Part of our core compatibility is understanding that life happens, and that anyone can plan some sorta once-a-year big thing, but consistency counts more. Amy took me on a day of motorsport fun just the last week and I've been running a new thing where we try a new coffee place each Sunday (and spots around it) in our major metro, but outside of our specific town.

It woulda been funny as hell to start my day with, ""Hey Clay and Amy, your 9 year anniversary is today.""

1no7h1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1no7h1p/i_solved_a_large_part_of_my_breath_issue_by/,I solved a large part of my breath issue by cutting out two things.,"When I first wake up, I like to drink 2-3 cups of coffee on an empty stomach. I would eat breakfast then brush my teeth. My breath would be ok for 30 minutes then begin to smell bad. 

Brushing got rid of the initial coffee breath, but the amount of coffee on an empty stomach made my breath smell terrible later. In a similar way of eating onions or garlic, you can brush to get rid of the initial smell but if you eat enough the smell lingers. Well, coffee was having that effect on me. I know it seems obvious but I thought that it couldn’t be coffee as I brush, floss, tongue scrape, mouth wash. Well, turns out my stomach didn’t like the large quantity of coffee sitting in it for hours afterwards.


Cutting sugar helped too. 


I know this seems obvious but for me it’s a game changer. No more morning coffee.",1,1758599846.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False
1no7fzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1no7fzu/i_killedmy_wife_and_i_see_her_everywhere/,I KilledMy Wife and I See Her Everywhere,"About six years ago, I killed my wife. It wasn’t premeditated or anything like that, it was actually the best thing that has happened to me in hindsight. That Thursday started out like every other vacation Jessi and I took. Wake up, coffee, argue about being late to a destination that we have no check in for, get in the car, wait for Jessi to go inside and get something she forgot and then, and only then, may we pull out of the driveway. We made our way up the mountain, singing along to songs that we could agree on and chatting about the scenery on the way up. 

Arriving at the cabin, her eyes were wide like a child in a candy store, she unbuckled her seatbelt and leaned closer to the dashboard. Jessi’s mouth agape with wonder and excitement- brought only one word to my brain-

“Beautiful..” I said under my breath. She turned to me and cocked her head to the side like a dog who heard a siren. 

“What was that, babe?”

“Oh, you’re beautiful, the sun is hitting your eyes just like it did on our wedding day.” She leaned in for a kiss- having not put the car in park yet, my foot pressed on the gas pedal as she rubbed my thigh, moving us towards the cabin ever so slightly. 

“How about we take this inside?” I whispered in her ear. She tugged on the bottom of my shirt and nodded. I shifted the car into park, turned it off and got out with my eyes glued to her. That night was everything we wanted, from the arrival to the dinner we made on the grill on the wrap-around deck to the deep conversation we had over a hot tub soak and a glass of wine. It must’ve been about 5:00 in the morning when I woke up in the hot tub, my face barely grazing the surface of the water. I looked around to see that my phone had died from leaving the flashlight on for us. I stick my arms out in front of me to feel around to Jessica,

“Jess?” silence.

“Jessi, are you still out here with me?” I kept feeling around the water, trying to guide my right hand from one wall to another. I begin to mutter her name again when I feel… her hair tangled around my fingers in the water, the jet pushing it and knotting it with each current. 

“Jessica, wha- what happened?” I lifted her head out of the water and pushed the mess of blonde hair out of her face. 

“Jessica, please, are you here with me?” I began smacking her face slightly at first but more and more as she continued to not respond. 

“What the fuck, Jessica? Stop doing this, stop this.” I climbed out of the hot tub beside her, grabbed her towel off of the side and wrapped it around her shoulders before slowly lifting her out of the pool. I tried to carry her inside of the basement door without causing any more harm. I continued up the stairs until we made it to the master bedroom. I laid her on the bed and tried to warm her up and make her comfortable as much as possible. I still don’t know why I didn’t just call the police and have someone come and help me. I was shocked, I was scared and more than anything, I wanted to be the one to save her. She married me and I told her I would keep her safe. I didn’t, I couldn’t. I laid beside her, putting my head on her chest and wrapping my arms around her torso. And for the first time since I was born- I cried, and cried, and cried. Her soft and whimpery voice sang me to sleep.

I woke up in the morning, my eyes puffy and swollen- crust filling the inner corners. I rubbed them with the bottom of my old college t-shirt and looked around. The bedding on Jessi’s side was perfectly tucked into the bottom of the pillow. I sat up, confused and started to hear humming from down the stairs. I stood, throwing my shorts on and opening the bedroom door, the smell of freshly brewed coffee hit me in the face like a train. I made my way down the stairs and into the kitchen, kissing Jessica on the neck while she handed me a plate of toast and eggs. I walked around to the other side of the kitchen table to grab a knife from the block. 

“Do you have the butter over there, honey?” I asked, turning around to her with the knife in my hand. She stood at the head of the table, her summer dress flowed with the wind of the open window. 

“Right here, darling.” She pointed to a long oval dish on the placement ahead of her. I stood to her side and sliced a perfect square of butter off of the plate. I slid my hand away from her throat and opened my eyes. Holding a pillow in one hand and a knife in the other, I look down onto Jessica’s lifeless body, now pouring thick red butter.

“I love you, Jessi. Good bye, now.” I kiss her on the head, walk out of the bedroom, close the door and walk down the stairs. I search Jessi’s purse for a lighter, leave the knife and make my way to the garage. A few jugs of old gasoline, paint thinner and a spark later and Jessica, her grandfather’s cabin and our car is gone. I stood at the edge of the driveway for a bit, watching the dance of the flames, sending Jessica away with the embers that flowed up towards the clouds. I turned around and walked back home. 

It’s now been six years at this point, and with Jessica not having any family and me practically faking my own death, I have an office job in a tech company in Tokyo. My life since then has been incredibly mundane- I don’t want to go through losing someone again. But, that day, I found her. I walked into my office and there was Jessica, sitting at the secretary’s desk. She was twisting her hair and smiling as she was on the phone. I pause for a moment, not sure if I’m seeing what I think I’m seeing and continue walking towards her. I stand by the desk until she sets the phone back on the deck.

“J-J-Jessi?” She turned around, her blonde hair whipping behind her beautiful freckled-covered shoulders. 

“Oh my god! Max! We haven’t seen you in forever! I missed you so much!”  She jumped out of her chair and gave me a huge hug, almost pushing me to the ground. 

“We? W- what do you mean, we?” She smiles and looks down at her stomach.

“Us! Silly! Oh come on, Thomas is so excited to meet his daddy!” She smiles at me, looking down and starts rubbing her stomach. 

“Dad? Jessi, what do you mean? I- it’s been- I don’t understand.” I pull my arms away from her and put them over my eyes. 

“I- I can’t be a dad without you Jessi, it just makes no sense…I-”

“Jessi? Max? Max, please, I need you to calm down.” I took my hands away from my eyes, Stephanie, the secretary, was looking up at me with her big soft eyes.

“Ms. Stephanie, oh my god, what happened? I-” She cut me off.

“Listen, I think you need to go home for the day, I’m going to let the boss know.”

“You really don’t have to do that, I’m totally fine.”

“Listen, I said what I said. Now go, rest.” She shooed me away with her hands. I turned around and took the next elevator down to the first floor to get to the train. Stepping on with someone from one of the higher floors. I kept my head plastered to my feet, only watching the steps I took. 

“So, I was thinking, like maybe a soft blue for our room, and then….hm…sage green for the bathroom?” I felt two arms wrap around my forearm and fingers intertwine with mine. 

“But, the only thing is, I kinda wanted Thomas’ room sage green to have the sun hit it like it did that teahouse we went to for our anniversary.” The elevator door chimed and I opened my eyes. The woman beside me was talking abhorrently loud to someone on the phone about her dog. I stepped out and made my way to the station.

 I checked my metro card, went through the tunnels and finally got to my platform. I took the only open bench on platform 7 and placed my briefcase on the seat beside me. 

“Max, max? Wake up baby, it’s happening. We have to go now. Max, wake up!” I shook my head awake and looked up, Jessica was bent over the side of the bed, holding her nightgown up off the floor.

“Jessica? What’s going on Jessi? Are you okay?” I jumped up out of the bed and ran over to her side. I placed my hands on her sides and helped her sit down.

“You stay here and I’m going to go get things together, okay?” She nodded and I rushed to the closet to grab extra clothes for her and I and rushed back to the bed. 

“Alright, let’s go baby.” I lifted her off the bed and led her to the front of the house, slid her shoes on and grabbed the keys- walking out in my socks. I shuffled her to the passenger side door and started rushing around the front of the car when I heard a blaring horn and felt a hand grab the back of my shirt.

I felt my body land on the ground, I heard my neck crack as my head smacked the floor. I tried to lift my body up and look around, the fluorescent lights blinded me at first.

“Hey man, don’t move okay, I called the police and they’re on the way.”

“Where am I?” I asked as he helped me lean up against a beam.

“You’re in the train station, someone tried to wake you up and you started sleep walking or some shit and almost got hit by the train dude, I have no idea how I got to you in time. Something out there must be watching over you, man.” The light still shined in my eyes but the stranger’s head covered most of it. As the last words left his lips, my eyes could perfectly adjust to a hand on his right shoulder. I traced it up the arm, then to the freckled shoulder, until I finally made it to Jessi’s perfect face. Her smile was as bright as ever.

The cops arrived right after I noticed her, with an ambulance in tow. It’s now been two months since the train station and I ended up turning myself in, it hasn’t helped suppress Jessica from my mind but, at least I now share a prison cell with her. ",1,1758599755.0,creepypasta,0,0.99,False

1no78z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1no78z0/i_killed_my_wife_and_i_see_her_everywhere/,I Killed My Wife and I See Her Everywhere,"About six years ago, I killed my wife. It wasn’t premeditated or anything like that, it was actually the best thing that has happened to me in hindsight. That Thursday started out like every other vacation Jessi and I took. Wake up, coffee, argue about being late to a destination that we have no check in for, get in the car, wait for Jessi to go inside and get something she forgot and then, and only then, may we pull out of the driveway. We made our way up the mountain, singing along to songs that we could agree on and chatting about the scenery on the way up. 

Arriving at the cabin, her eyes were wide like a child in a candy store, she unbuckled her seatbelt and leaned closer to the dashboard. Jessi’s mouth agape with wonder and excitement- brought only one word to my brain-

“Beautiful..” I said under my breath. She turned to me and cocked her head to the side like a dog who heard a siren. 

“What was that, babe?”

“Oh, you’re beautiful, the sun is hitting your eyes just like it did on our wedding day.” She leaned in for a kiss- having not put the car in park yet, my foot pressed on the gas pedal as she rubbed my thigh, moving us towards the cabin ever so slightly. 

“How about we take this inside?” I whispered in her ear. She tugged on the bottom of my shirt and nodded. I shifted the car into park, turned it off and got out with my eyes glued to her. That night was everything we wanted, from the arrival to the dinner we made on the grill on the wrap-around deck to the deep conversation we had over a hot tub soak and a glass of wine. It must’ve been about 5:00 in the morning when I woke up in the hot tub, my face barely grazing the surface of the water. I looked around to see that my phone had died from leaving the flashlight on for us. I stick my arms out in front of me to feel around to Jessica,

“Jess?” silence.

“Jessi, are you still out here with me?” I kept feeling around the water, trying to guide my right hand from one wall to another. I begin to mutter her name again when I feel… her hair tangled around my fingers in the water, the jet pushing it and knotting it with each current. 

“Jessica, wha- what happened?” I lifted her head out of the water and pushed the mess of blonde hair out of her face. 

“Jessica, please, are you here with me?” I began smacking her face slightly at first but more and more as she continued to not respond. 

“What the fuck, Jessica? Stop doing this, stop this.” I climbed out of the hot tub beside her, grabbed her towel off of the side and wrapped it around her shoulders before slowly lifting her out of the pool. I tried to carry her inside of the basement door without causing any more harm. I continued up the stairs until we made it to the master bedroom. I laid her on the bed and tried to warm her up and make her comfortable as much as possible. I still don’t know why I didn’t just call the police and have someone come and help me. I was shocked, I was scared and more than anything, I wanted to be the one to save her. She married me and I told her I would keep her safe. I didn’t, I couldn’t. I laid beside her, putting my head on her chest and wrapping my arms around her torso. And for the first time since I was born- I cried, and cried, and cried. Her soft and whimpery voice sang me to sleep.

I woke up in the morning, my eyes puffy and swollen- crust filling the inner corners. I rubbed them with the bottom of my old college t-shirt and looked around. The bedding on Jessi’s side was perfectly tucked into the bottom of the pillow. I sat up, confused and started to hear humming from down the stairs. I stood, throwing my shorts on and opening the bedroom door, the smell of freshly brewed coffee hit me in the face like a train. I made my way down the stairs and into the kitchen, kissing Jessica on the neck while she handed me a plate of toast and eggs. I walked around to the other side of the kitchen table to grab a knife from the block. 

“Do you have the butter over there, honey?” I asked, turning around to her with the knife in my hand. She stood at the head of the table, her summer dress flowed with the wind of the open window. 

“Right here, darling.” She pointed to a long oval dish on the placement ahead of her. I stood to her side and sliced a perfect square of butter off of the plate. I slid my hand away from her throat and opened my eyes. Holding a pillow in one hand and a knife in the other, I look down onto Jessica’s lifeless body, now pouring thick red butter.

“I love you, Jessi. Good bye, now.” I kiss her on the head, walk out of the bedroom, close the door and walk down the stairs. I search Jessi’s purse for a lighter, leave the knife and make my way to the garage. A few jugs of old gasoline, paint thinner and a spark later and Jessica, her grandfather’s cabin and our car is gone. I stood at the edge of the driveway for a bit, watching the dance of the flames, sending Jessica away with the embers that flowed up towards the clouds. I turned around and walked back home. 

It’s now been six years at this point, and with Jessica not having any family and me practically faking my own death, I have an office job in a tech company in Tokyo. My life since then has been incredibly mundane- I don’t want to go through losing someone again. But, that day, I found her. I walked into my office and there was Jessica, sitting at the secretary’s desk. She was twisting her hair and smiling as she was on the phone. I pause for a moment, not sure if I’m seeing what I think I’m seeing and continue walking towards her. I stand by the desk until she sets the phone back on the deck.

“J-J-Jessi?” She turned around, her blonde hair whipping behind her beautiful freckled-covered shoulders. 

“Oh my god! Max! We haven’t seen you in forever! I missed you so much!”  She jumped out of her chair and gave me a huge hug, almost pushing me to the ground. 

“We? W- what do you mean, we?” She smiles and looks down at her stomach.

“Us! Silly! Oh come on, Thomas is so excited to meet his daddy!” She smiles at me, looking down and starts rubbing her stomach. 

“Dad? Jessi, what do you mean? I- it’s been- I don’t understand.” I pull my arms away from her and put them over my eyes. 

“I- I can’t be a dad without you Jessi, it just makes no sense…I-”

“Jessi? Max? Max, please, I need you to calm down.” I took my hands away from my eyes, Stephanie, the secretary, was looking up at me with her big soft eyes.

“Ms. Stephanie, oh my god, what happened? I-” She cut me off.

“Listen, I think you need to go home for the day, I’m going to let the boss know.”

“You really don’t have to do that, I’m totally fine.”

“Listen, I said what I said. Now go, rest.” She shooed me away with her hands. I turned around and took the next elevator down to the first floor to get to the train. Stepping on with someone from one of the higher floors. I kept my head plastered to my feet, only watching the steps I took. 

“So, I was thinking, like maybe a soft blue for our room, and then….hm…sage green for the bathroom?” I felt two arms wrap around my forearm and fingers intertwine with mine. 

“But, the only thing is, I kinda wanted Thomas’ room sage green to have the sun hit it like it did that teahouse we went to for our anniversary.” The elevator door chimed and I opened my eyes. The woman beside me was talking abhorrently loud to someone on the phone about her dog. I stepped out and made my way to the station.

 I checked my metro card, went through the tunnels and finally got to my platform. I took the only open bench on platform 7 and placed my briefcase on the seat beside me. 

“Max, max? Wake up baby, it’s happening. We have to go now. Max, wake up!” I shook my head awake and looked up, Jessica was bent over the side of the bed, holding her nightgown up off the floor.

“Jessica? What’s going on Jessi? Are you okay?” I jumped up out of the bed and ran over to her side. I placed my hands on her sides and helped her sit down.

“You stay here and I’m going to go get things together, okay?” She nodded and I rushed to the closet to grab extra clothes for her and I and rushed back to the bed. 

“Alright, let’s go baby.” I lifted her off the bed and led her to the front of the house, slid her shoes on and grabbed the keys- walking out in my socks. I shuffled her to the passenger side door and started rushing around the front of the car when I heard a blaring horn and felt a hand grab the back of my shirt.

I felt my body land on the ground, I heard my neck crack as my head smacked the floor. I tried to lift my body up and look around, the fluorescent lights blinded me at first.

“Hey man, don’t move okay, I called the police and they’re on the way.”

I grow microgreens at home with various other seeds, including sunflower seeds, which actually kind of resemble honey locust sprouts, which is where this idea germinated (hardeehar).

I have heard that honey locust pods and seeds are, technically, edible, although mostly not that delicious unless you get them at the right time.  The leaves are theoretically edible as well.

So, could I grow the honey locust seeds safely as large microgreens (to be eaten by humans)?  I have so many of the dang things that if I could put them to good use for something other than coffee substitute or squirrel food, that would be lovely. 

My apologies ahead of time if this is a ridiculous question...

(Also, I am 100% sure this in a honey locust and not a black locust.)

Thank you!

Edit to add:  I do not own goats or cattle, so sadly, I cannot feed them the pods.",1,1758599086.0,foraging,0,1.0,False

When I go back to the Lelit stock portafilter that comes with the machine, zero leaks. The stock portafilter comes with a 14-18g Lelit by IMS basket.

I've ensured the basket in the bottomless portafilter is properly seated, it is inserted straight (not at any angle) - no lock 

With both (stock and bottomless) portafilters, I have been using 18g of coffee grinds. 

any insight you can share to get the leak resolved?

My 2 bridesmaids and my friends got ready at an airbnb and then the plan was to bring my dress to the venue to put on. I was planning on bringing my dress and had it in hand but my family friend insisted that she will bring the dress and shoes so she can lay the dress out in her backseat. Since she insisted I was like ok it’s my wedding I will take her up on it so it’s one less thing I have to carry. Before I left I told her “ok, but I need to put on the dress as soon as I get to the venue so will you be coming right now too?” I said this to her and my sister (bridesmaid) and they said “yes we are literally going to be right behind you”. I get to the venue in 5 minutes (2pm) and then I’m waiting and waiting for the dress/them. And nothing. I was very overstimulated so it like didn’t occur to me to call them and ask where they/the dress is. Finally, around 2:20 ish (my first look was supposed to be 2:30pm) they (family friend and my bridesmaid sister) come but without the dress and they have drinks from a coffee shop. I was like uhhh where is my dress? And the family friend said “oh it’s with my husband” and I was like “I need to put in on right NOW” and then she calls her husband to bring it and he does. 

I’m annoyed because I am a punctual person and I don’t like rushing. I also rarely trust others with things. I know it wasn’t terribly late but I had prepped lots of time for me to get into my dress calmly before first look. But instead I rushed into it and then ran for first look. I’m annoyed because I don’t understand why if I said I need to be in the dress immediately why they would do a detour. I don’t understand why my sister would agree to that when she also had the timeline. It just feels like disappointing and like no one cared enough. And like I should have done everything myself and brought my dress like I always do because this is what happens when I rely on others. But I thought ok this is an ok time to rely on others cuz it’s my wedding day. But no. 

Anyways I told them both how it made me feel last week. They both apologized and said they shouldn’t have done that but figured the dress was coming to the venue through the husband (even though no one told me who had the dress).

1no71cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1no71cb/my_first_night_in_months_with_zero_drinks/,My first night in months with zero drinks,"I haven't gone to bed sober since probably May. Before that, I was drinking every other night for the majority of 2023, 2024, and the first few months of 2025. Alternating days where I'm firing on all cylinders in perfect health with deathly hungover days where I'm bleh and it doesn't get better until I wake up the next day.

2020 and 2021, I drank about once a week, though I was completely sober in November-December 2021 minus a few drinks at parties and stuff. 2019, I got drunk maybe 6 times. I was hardcore sober in 2019.

I've always been completely sober during the day. Never been a ""wake up and drink"" type or anything. Only ever at night before bed.

These last 5 months, I've been having about 9 standard drinks before bed every night, watching films, reading random shit, watching random shit... Lately, I couldn't stand doing anything drunk besides watching films, sneaking off to go smoke drunk-cigarettes on my patio too, and that's what I've been doing with my nights lately.

Funny thing about drinking every night as opposed to every other night is that after the alcohol wore off the next day, I stopped getting hangovers. Felt perfectly fine during the day...

Until last night. I couldn't hold up that habit forever. Eventually, something had to give. I'm in shape, I refuel on food and supplements between drinking seshes, I sleep well despite all the booze in my system. I figured I'm allowed my vices. I fall asleep so much more easily drunk than I do sober.

I was getting ready for the usual ""pick what movie to watch while sipping whiskey"" routine, then I got hit with the worst anxiety attack I've ever had. I figured it was dehydration or a nutrient deficiency or withdrawals coming in, so I took my first shot of the night, downed a ton of water, and ate some foods to cover my bases with electrolytes and stuff... all of which I puked out.

My night's ruined then, I thought. It's time for me to stop doing this every night. This is over. I gotta quit drinking every night.

I took some ashwagandha, magnesium glycinate, and l-theanine for the anxiety, and they helped immensely. I was really chilled out while sober-watching the first half-hour of a movie.

Then when I went to bed, I was in high alert. Unable to fall asleep. I knew it was time for me to pay my dues for all the drunk fun I'd had every night these last few months, and after a bunch of pondering, I decided it was the right move to go to the ER in case this is leading to a seizure.

A bit past midnight, I showed up to the ER. They triaged me, I explained my drinking habits to the triage nurse (not during the day, just at night before bed, last drink was around 9:15 PM), then I was in the waiting room until around 4:30 AM (yay for the Canadian healthcare system) before they brought me to a bed and I got my vitals taken. Anxiety and nausea persisted. I ended up staying in that room unseen by a doctor until 7:something AM, where I cut my losses and just went home. All symptoms gone.

Slept like shit this morning, <2 hours. Had a couple handfuls of pasta after I woke up, then I puked up a fuckton of liquid. Some kombucha and coffee helped me feel way better, and after those, I made it to the gym and performed there as I normally do.

But yeah, fast-forward to tonight. I feel fine despite the sleep deprivation. I was never constantly drunk, so the come-down from a binge-drinking sesh when I'm usually sober is way easier and less dangerous than that of someone who'd consistently be drunk all the time. I'm just chugging spring water, typing this post, and not planning on doing a ""drink every night before bed"" routine ever again.

I'm excited to start living sober again, not having to wake up and piss before going back to bed every morning, see what my morning weight is when I'm well-hydrated waking up, and what my weight during the day is when I'm not bombarding my body with strong diuretics every night.

And I'll see how my mental clarity and overall well-being change now that it's time for me to sober up.

1no6z21,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GoodClasher/comments/1no6z21/bad_day_in_hell/,Bad Day in Hell,"The sound of heels on tile echoed through the hall as Velza made her way past the offices. One hell spawn gnawed a pen down to splinters. Another was literally yanking tufts of hair from their scalp. Down the hall, a third opened a window on the twelfth floor and stared out like they were considering the quick way down.Weird, Velza thought. But then again, this is Hell. If we’re not miserable, are we even doing our jobs?She pushed into the breakroom and spotted a familiar face. “Oh, hey, Man. What’s up?” 

He spun around, drenched in sweat, a coffee cup in his hand. He downed it in one gulp. “Wait—you haven’t heard the news?” “No. What happened?” “We botched it, Velza!” He slammed his cup down, immediately pouring another, his shaky hand spilling more than he filled. “Botched what? Whatever it is, it can’t be that bad, right? Just tell me.” “The apocalypse, Velza! We botched the apocalypse!” He chugged the second cup and reached for a third. “WHAT?! HOW?!” Velza shrieked, her voice cracking. “One of Aalazar’s underlings. And a human. Just one of each! You can’t make this shit up!” He laughed, half hysterical, pouring yet another cup of coffee. Velza’s skin deepened a shade redder. “What about the boss? How’d he react?” 

“Oh, he doesn’t know yet. Nobody’s told him.”Velza started pacing, nearly hyperventilating. “Oh, damn it. Can this day get any worse? ”Yeah, uh—ninety percent of our army got wiped out too.” He gulped his fourth cup, sweat dripping from his horns. “Shut up!!” Velza snapped, ready to blow a blood vessel. “When did this happen? And why am I just now hearing about it?”“Few hours ago. Four-thirty sharp. And as for why—well, you’re the Boss’s assistant. If anyone’s gonna tell him, it’s you.” He sipped his fifth cup with jittering hands.Velza crushed the mug in his grip, splattering coffee across his face. “Damn you and damn your coffee.” She stormed out, slamming the door behind her. 

Back in the hall, the same hell spawn was still eyeing the window. Maybe I should join him, she thought, shaking her head. Instead, Velza ducked into the bathroom. She stared into the mirror: bright red skin, black hair wound neatly into a bun, square-framed glasses, a white blouse tucked into a black skirt. She pointed at her reflection. “You can do this. You’re gonna tell him—because it’s your job. And you’re not gonna let him blame you, or take his shit, this time.” She straightened her blouse and marched out. At the end of the corridor, two massive black doors loomed. She paced in front of them, heart hammering, then shoved them open. Inside, the Devil sat at the head of a long boardroom table, meeting with the heads of Hell’s nine sectors. Every eye in the room turned to her. Velza froze. The Devil sighed. “What is it, Velza? Is it that damn printer again? I told you—you just have to flip the switch on the side.”Velza shook her head, mute. “Then can it wait? We’re in the middle of discussing a new torture method. You’ll love it, I'll tell you later.” He chuckled at his own joke. Velza shook her head again, more desperately. The Devil rubbed his temples. “Alright then. What’s the problem?”Velza’s knees locked as the nine sector heads stared her down. She rushed to the far end of the table and leaned close, whispering the words into his ear. The Devil froze. Silent for a long second. “I need to excuse myself.” 

He rose, pushed in his chair, and walked calmly into his private office, shutting the glass door behind him. Velza and the board could only watch as he erupted—screaming, hurling papers, sweeping his desk clear, and smashing his chair into the wall before pitching it out the window. Twelve stories down, it exploded on the pavement. The Devil straightened his tie, smoothed his suit, and re-entered the boardroom. “Sorry about that. Needed some fresh air.” He waved a hand. “Everyone out except you, Velza. Clear everything on todays schedule.” Once everyone left gone, he leaned forward, eyes narrowing. “Say it again. So, I know I heard right.” “We… botched the apocalypse, sir.” He dragged his hands through his hair.  

“Alright. Fine. We’ll assess the damage and fix it. Who was leading?” “Aalazar, sir.” Velza squeezed her wrist The Devil groaned. “And what happened? Military wiped us out?”Velza swallowed. “N-no. Just… two individuals.” The Devil’s eye twitched. “It was WHAT?!” “T-two individuals,” Velza whispered. “I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME!” He slammed his fists on the table, his face reddening. “And who are these so-called heroes?”Velza looked away. “One of ours… and a human they seemed to fancy, sir.” The Devil sighed, long and tortured. “Goddamn it.” He slumped back in his chair. “Fine. We regroup the army. That’s the only option.”Velza hesitated. “…They wiped the army out, sir.” The Devil’s head dropped into his hands. Slowly, he pointed at the door. “Get out.” 

“S-sorry, sir.” Velza hurried out and shut the door behind her. Inside, overheated and steaming, the Devil staggered to a corner table, grabbed a flower vase, gulped from it, and dumped the rest over his face. Velza collapsed at her desk, breathing hard. For a moment, she let herself imagine how the day should have gone, finish a few papers, schedule some appointments, maybe even-. The doors slammed open. Slow, heavy footsteps echoed up the hall. Sulfur filled the air. Only the highest-ranking hellspawn carried that stench. Velza’s eyes widened as a tall, slender figure rounded the corner. Dark grey skin, immaculate black-and-white pinstriped suit, and a fresh blade wound still lodged in his shoulder. “Aalazar? We thought you were-” “Where’s the Boss?” he interrupted, towering over her. Velza didn’t speak. She only pointed toward the boardroom. Aalazar turned and strode in with the same measured calm. Inside, the Devil didn’t even look up at first. “Velza I told you, stay out unless it’s-” He stopped. “Aalazar? We thought you were dead. W-what happened. The devil shocked to see him at all.” Aalazar lowered himself into a chair opposite. His voice was quiet, dangerous. “I put trust in the wrong hellspawn. I was blinded by favoritism. I will not make the same mistake twice.” The Devil forced a smile, sweat beading his brow. “Right. Of course. You’re very good at… not making the same mistake twice.” He fumbled to the water fountain and returned with a ridiculously tiny cup. “Hot in here, isn’t it? We really need AC.” He gulped it down. Aalazar drummed his fingers on the table. “Who are you sending after them?” “Oh, I was just about to… handle that,” the Devil said, voice cracking. 

“I’ll do it,” Aalazar said flatly. “I’ll go after them.” The Devil blinked. “Are you sure? I mean, they beat you once. You’re still wounded-” Aalazar stood. His glare silenced the room. The Devil raised his tiny cup in surrender. “…Ya know what? Yeah. You go for it, man.” He tossed back the last drop of water as Aalazar walked out with calm, deliberate steps. “Hey! Maybe brunch tomorrow?” the Devil called weakly after him. “Yeah? Brunch?” Silence. Aalazar kept walking. The Devil slumped in his chair, staring at the empty cup. “We… really need AC.”

• Which areas/suburbs are good for studying in a quiet, safe environment, yet with decent cafes/coffee shops / bars nearby?
• Where are the best libraries (public or private) for serious studying?
• What’s the process for renting a flat independent room? What kind of deposit is needed, lease duration, negotiation tips?
• How are people generally (friendly / newcomer-helpful)?

I have a Liberal Arts Associates degree from a community college (2012, 3.8 GPA) and a B.S. from Cornell University in Plant Sciences (2016) focusing on evolution (GPA was only a 3.0 - I was going through a lot at that point in my life). After graduating, I tried finding jobs nearby, but felt super lost and couldn't find anything that didn't require a masters back in 2016 with what I wanted to do or felt that I could do. I worked at a few plant nurseries here and there, some office work, then a coffee shop, and am currently working as a microchip technician. 

I fully understand that none of these jobs have really anything to do with what I studied. Being a microchip technician and looking into a microscope all day has actually reminded me of what I enjoy doing though. I'm a very simple person. Cells, evolution, fossils..all of that is so super interesting to me and I'd love to make a job of it. Most of what I'm finding still requires a master's degree though, so I've been looking at the requirements for applying. I feel so out of touch though. Considering I haven't done anything involving my B.S. degree, is it even possible for me to go back for an M.A. in Biological Sciences? One of the requirements is a CV. I looked at some examples and I realized if I were to make one out for myself, it would be so unimpressive. I don't even think I would stand a chance.

I think my biggest reason for going back would be the new connections I'd have in order to find a decent job doing something I actually enjoy. I feel that I now at least have some of the experience necessary to set myself up a bit better than back when I was young and knew nothing. I'm also part of a vocational rehabilitation center for the mentally and physically disabled, and my counselor is really making me feel like this is possible. She's very much pushing me to do so and really wants me to succeed, but the more I research about applying, the more depressed I get.

I suppose it can't hurt to apply, but I really am trying not to get my hopes up. They only accept applications for the fall, so I would have maybe some time to add to my CV, but I have no clue what I would even need to research or do for that. I feel just as lost as when I graduated with my bachelors. Please, any help would be welcomed.",4,1758598075.0,gradadmissions,8,1.0,False

THE BLOB


Denial

I have been staring at it for three weeks. All it does is keep growing. It began as a small dot of red on my white linoleum kitchen floor. I thought that maybe Charlie had attacked a mouse and left a drop of blood in the tussle. Maybe it was from my paints that I tend to work with on my canvases on the kitchen table, though it had been weeks since I had any interest in doing things like that. Nothing seemed enjoyable any more. Maybe it could have been old spaghetti sauce from my Americanized cooking that would make any full blood Italian grimace. Then again, I have not had the will power to cook a meal like that in weeks either. So that only made my ponderings around this ever growing dot more and more grandeur and not based in reality. That also limited any options that could even seem rational. The contrast of the red against the white was jarring my vision and diverting me from my tasks as it always distracted my mind when I would step into my kitchen and spot the red dot simply sitting there. I tried to not pay it mind, but it kept drawing me in further. I wondered if it was growing and spreading day after day, as I could see it ebb and flow, wax and wane, almost like it was breathing as it slowly conquered new territory.  All I knew is that I needed to clean it up. It may have provided me this sort of way to zone out and numb me as I was fixated by it, placed almost into a trance-like state, but that was not helping the situation. Now it was starting to become too expansive, where it was not something I could just ignore its spreading any longer. I needed to take action. 
I was exhausted at this point just watching it fester on that floor. It was doing no good to simply watch it and hope it could eventually contain itself. I pondered if I could even befriend it. I do admit that it had gotten rather lonely recently, even with Charlie. Charlie has seemed quite mopey and disconnected as well most of the time, to be honest. 
I ended up getting some bleach and a sponge from under the kitchen sink for convenience. Any other forethought outside that felt exhausting. I made sure to have a sponge that was abrasive. After this red blob had been sitting so long on the kitchen floor, it was hard to tell how stuck or stubborn it was going to be to get up. I crouched on the ground with my bleach bottle. Charlie perched on top of the counter looking down at the red splotch, meowing like the blob was challenging his territorial rights. I uncapped the bleach bottle and immediately the fumes rushed up my nostrils and began to burn as they shot up my nasal passages. It was such a familiar scent that even with its sting there was also this sense of calming. 

My mind began to drift into a past memory of sitting poolside on the Savannah, Georgia coastal in a cheap motel. She was lecturing how I needed to wear sunscreen and spoke quotes from WebMD like facts about Melanoma, as though I was her patient. She seemed to never be able to take a break from her work, even on vacation it was still her constant baseline mindset. This was supposed to be our honeymoon, but everything felt like a chore. It would just lead to us bickering more rather than enjoying ourselves. Not to mention she was dealing with the hormones of being pregnant as well. Her belly was pronounced and I could feel Kyle’s feet kick. I would sometimes see them press against her stomach as he would rearrange in the womb to get more comfortable. I struggled to imagine being a Dad, but each day it was becoming more of a reality. I could feel my muscles freeze up every time he would kick. It was hard to describe the sensation that came over me. The best I could describe was a momentary panic, reminding me of this future to come with an unplanned child and a new family. It was overwhelming, but I couldn’t let her know that. She was already overwhelmed enough with her pregnancy. She was going to have to be on bedrest the last four months of her pregnancy. She did not know this yet, but this was our last vacation together. I wish I could have allowed myself to enjoy it more. 

My attention fixated back to the floor as I realized I was pouring an excessive amount of bleach out of my bottle when my mind had drifted elsewhere. I had been so much more sensitive to little triggers, it felt like anything could set me off at this point. That one smell stole my mind away to the point that I must have poured a quarter of the bottle out. I yanked the bottle back as Charlie proceeded to hiss at me and slap the air. I could not blame him, I am sure the bleach aggravated his tiny nostrils more than my own. 
“Shit,” I muttered to myself as I examined the bleach pooled all over my kitchen floor. 
I once again froze in this sense of panic. As I gazed upon my mess, uncertain of how to go about cleaning it and what step to take first, I watched something marvelous unfold. The small red splotch began to stretch its girth with the legs of a spider across the surface of the bleach, staining it all the same crimson red. It was as if it was feeding off the bleach at this point, and not hindered by it, only allowing it to increase its expanse. As the thin red veins weaved through each other, they filled up the 12-inch diameter pool of sticky fluid. It felt very much like the intricate arteries of the human body threading into one conglomerate system. The solution started to ripple with small bubbles. This began to grow more violent. Charlie even pulled backwards till his furry touched the back wall of the countertop with his fur sticking up on its ends. The crimson liquid would spout up and pop and splatter in the air before raining back down. I was almost hypnotic and rhythmic. I couldn’t tell if it was more alive or if it was simply struggling to breathe more so now that the bleach had fused with it. 
Charlie began to inch himself closer to the counter’s edge when he realized that the pops and splatters were not coming to attack him. Charlie had a sinister and foul look upon his scrunched up face peering upon the popping molten goop. The liquid became thicker and richer as Charlie swatted the air and hissed, spraying saliva particles over the blob below. Charlie’s spastic nature was getting more chaotic. There was this mug that was near the coffee maker next to Charlie on the counter. In one spastic side-hop tumble-kick, Charlie kicked with his back foot the mug as he flailed back where the handle became slightly hooked on his toe beans, causing the mug to fly with him into the air. Upon another swift jerk the mug was released from his foot and tumbled straight down into the path of the pool of sticky sludge below. Instinctively I reached out to grab it, but missed as it splattered into the red sticky goop. I watched the mug sink into the sludge in a way that it seemed to fall through the floor. Once the bubbling settled, I quickly pulled the mug by its exposed handle out of the sticky mess to find that only half of the mug came back in my grasp. The other half appeared to have been eaten through like by a corrosive acid. It was almost like a bite was taken out of it with the raw jagged edges singed with only a hint of red imprinting against the white clay of the mug as a subtle smoke almost seemed to rise from its wounds. Only half of the smiley face that once adorned it was now visible. The other half looked to have been bitten off and consumed by this blob of red that now seemed ever more dangerous than before. It seemed that mixing that bleach with whatever this red substance was was only creating a caustic solution now like a chemistry experiment. It felt almost like blasphemy to hold her mug, a mug only fit for her hand. Its handle shared her embrace, and that felt like too much for me to bear. I quickly let the mug drop back down below. It proceeded to be swallowed within the red liquid leaving only an eye peering at me from its once smiling face, till it sank further and there was nothing at all left to see. It was almost like it had never existed. 

That was her mug. She used to make her French roast coffee, that nice dark blend, each morning in the French press. I was not fond of coffee, so she would make just enough for her singular cup and enjoyed the meditative process of it all. I had bought her the mug when we started dating, first valentines, because I said that her smile always brought me joy and so it just seemed fitting for her. It was filled with chocolates at the time. I also remember when she stopped using the mug. It was when she found out decaffeinated coffee still had caffeine. She couldn’t hurt Kyle. She cried for hours and carried a lot of guilt for the few weeks she had still drank her decaf coffee. She started thinking drastically that he might get a birth defect or be born premature and it would be her fault. I never touched the mug since she left it on that counter next to her coffee press. There were decaf coffee grounds ready to be pressed sitting inside that would now never be used.  

Now I didn't have to worry about the mug upsetting me or worrying about engaging with it anymore. What once sat on that counter smiling at me, knowing my pain, was now nothing more. This provided some sense of relief, one less trigger to illicit memories I no longer wanted. But that was not the end of my triggers. 
I hated that flood of images and thoughts of her and her beauty mixed with the positive times I craved and the negative times I regretted. Then when the regret seeped in there came this guilt. Soon I was washed over with a wave of hopelessness that I buried with numbing emptiness as quickly as I could. I would then zone out into the red sea. I tried to refocus and redirect my brain, but everything always came back to her. How could it now when I lived in the home we shared. I noticed the more active my thoughts, the more the pool or red would bubble. But when I would focus on its red color alone and the way it ebbed and flowed, the bubbles settled. 
The worst is when I would immediately reach my “flight’ mode when Kyle cried from the living room bouncy chair. That cry made me want to scream when I heard it. I could hardly stare at his face on a normal day, yet alone after a trigger of unwanted memories. When I look at his face, all that I see is her. Good or bad times, I still loved her. She may not have thought about how Kyle and I could survive if she wasn’t around, but who thinks of that or wants to. That should not have kept us from having a baby, but maybe we needed more medical precautions to keep her safe. Maybe she should have been more careful about the caffeine intake.
 I still could not deny now, though, that looking up upon my counter top had become a pleasant relief since the mug was gone. Now my thoughts started turning to what else was not necessary and was only triggering and holding myself back in some way into her spider web’s grasp. I was still alive and I had to move forward, even if that meant losing things along the way to ease that process. 
Some part of me accepted this red sticky slimy sludge as my friend. It was going to help me get rid of these triggers. The things I did not want to be in my home any longer. Everything that made me remember she existed was to be sent to the red blob.  But knowing I could never have dropped her mug myself into the sludge, especially with the guilt I already carried, I decided to utilize the help of Charlie. 
`	Charlie was going to be my direct contact. When I would place an object that was a trigger for me in front of him on the counter’s ledge, he would go and push it off the counter so it could fall below into the blob. We were a perfect team. It started off with small things, like her wedding ring, cell phone, wallet, hat, keychains, make-up, toothbrush, loofa, facial scrub, shoes, childhood stuffed bunny, romance novels, laptop, candles and other knickknacks. 
I had gotten to the point now that I was digging through the back of her closet. It felt like a drug almost to be able to simply banish all these triggers into the blob. And the immediate relief to know it was never going to upset me again or bring her face across my mind was almost an overwhelming sense of peace. I just could not stop going till it was all gone. In the very back of the closet, buried under some winter clothes, was a music box. It was a pale cream color with little circus designs like gymnasts, tightrope walkers, and acrobats painted about on it. It even had a line of elephants and a lion tamer with his cat. I knew this was something that she grew up with in her childhood, gifted to her by her grandmother who was now deceased. 

She wanted to pass the jewelry music box down to her own daughter one day. She would periodically wind it up at the bottom and press it to her stomach during the early weeks of the pregnancy so that she could open the lid and play the music that emanated out as a small acrobat danced. She was so excited at the beginning, imagining how her daughter would be and making plans to raise her and give her everything she did not have growing up. She was planning outfits and already had her name picked since she was a teenager for her daughter. She would name her “Kylie”. It was the second trimester, though, that our path changed. At her doctor’s appointment she was offered to know the sex of her child and she hated a surprise, so agreed.  It was a disappointment in most ways for her to find out she was pregnant with a boy and not a baby girl. Her dream name of “Kylie” for her daughter became “Kyle” instead. This certainly was something that led her to verbalize how she felt less connected to the child inside of her womb when she found out the gender.  She described it as if her body had betrayed her. I encouraged a vacation to help lift her spirits, as I could tell the toll this information had taken on her. We had just got married at the courthouse when we found out she was pregnant and I thought a honeymoon would be nice to have. She seemed disinterested. She ended up having to bury her once prized music box from her own childhood in the back of her closet and stored out of sight for the first time in our relationship. That seemed to be her trigger. 

I placed the Jewelry box next to Charlie who was already in place as he knew a reward of supper and treats would be afterwards. The one thing that I did not think about was that the music box when tapped would be prone to make small bits of noise from its inner chamber. I also underestimated how this would impact Charlie. I placed the music box down and Charlie started going in for his light taps to guide it over the counter’s edge, when suddenly his first tap elicited a sharp pinging ring of a few notes of “Some Where Over the Rainbow”, which caused Charlie to jolt back in shock. In the process of doing so he fell on his back and accidentally kicked the music box again with his back foot. This caused a sporadic thrusting of his body that flipped him about almost like a seizure. This caused him to get too close to the edge of the counter without realizing as he was so very panicked. With one of his final body “flops”, he fell off, and tried to reach a paw back out to get a grip. He ended up grabbing the music box's windup knob and pulled the music box down with him. Slipping, he fell down until he himself smashed into the wide pull of red goop with the music box clambering shortly behind him letting out its final notes to the lyrics “why oh why can’t I”. 
	
Charlie was supposed to be our practice child. We had adopted him from a local kill shelter, he was already 2 years old at the time, in hopes of giving him a better life. She spoiled Charlie and would put little bowties on his orange and white fur and give him extra treats and catnip. It seemed he was always rolling around inebriated most the day on the kitty nip. She made me address Charlie as my “son” and we fussed at him like you would a mischievous toddler. He would instead of giving hugs later make biscuits with his toe beans. Charlie was very close to her and would always sleep on her chest at night or by her right side in the bed, right between us both. Sometimes if Charlie came too close, I swore he still smelled like her. Even before he would smell like her perfume most days when I would lean in to kiss the top of his head. He was our son. 

What followed were the immediate screams and cries of a cat in distress and pain as Charlie wailed and tried to flail about in the blob's grasp. My panic wanted to scoop Charlie out, but he was already melting within the goop and halfway down. I ended up closing my eyes and balling up on the floor covering my ears screaming out as loud as I could to drown out any remaining noise of Charlie’s final cries. I rocked back and forth and felt a sick agony wash over my body like being hit by a semi-truck. My heart was racing so intensely I felt like I was about to have a stroke due to the tachycardia, at least that is what she would tell me. I swore I could still hear the gurgling bubbles coming out of Charlie’s throat even after he was finally submerged. 
I felt so meek and pathetic like I was just a novice playing games against the master and expecting to win. When something appears too easy, that is a warning sign. Nothing is ever easy. Dropping her gel pens, jewelry, dental floss, rosebud deodorant, hair brush, aquamarine nail polish, phone charger, pom keychain,…  it was all too much. It was not the freedom I believed when Charlie would swat away her chapstick from the counter to sink into the abysmal red pool below. Because, now, Charlie was fed to this monster. This monster is a reckless, pestering, spreading disease. It was not my friend. Who would think that a simple floor stain would culminate to this. Everything that she even touched, even our cat, my cat, gets lost in its insufferable bubbling. Consumed and tortured in its own sick version of my personal living hell. I needed to stop it before it was too late, before I had my back turned and it slaps a thick bright red sludge across my shoulders, bubbling into my ears and pulling me down into the depths of its being for eternity.

Anger

What I did first to try and eradicate the blob was to hurt it with a hefty dose of rat poison. Much similar to when I used the bleach, I just sprinkled the powder all over the blob on the floor. It felt like coating christmas cookies with a dusting of confectionery sugar, except much different in smell and hopefully affect as well. I made sure to tap the box empty like she would her cereal boxes to get that extra sweet sugar dust that had fallen off and collected inside the bottom. As I watched with hope, it was quickly diminished. Much like someone who takes aspirin and then gets a cut, the once goopy red showered in white powder now melted from a semi-solid to a liquid, like snow to water. I could not escape it. The moment the rat poison penetrated the crimson gel it immediately liquified into a runny fluid that was deep red and grew larger and larger in expanse on the linoleum floor till it pushed me out of the kitchen.  It started to branch out into the dining room and living room like the endless legs of a spider prying into my habitat. 
Kyle was now screaming at the top of his lungs. He sat in his baby sway swing, which was supposed to help calm and sooth him, with his mouth agape, head tilted back, wailing as tears pooled down into his diaper. He kept crying till his voice even became hoarse as he started choking on the dry air. I understood now how my wife felt when she would comment how overwhelming the baby was and how exhausted she was and how she just wanted to strangle his little neck. She said these things before he was even born. I ran upstairs to the bathroom once the red liquid started to creep halfway across the living room rug. Kyle swung petrified on the other side. I went into the medicine cabinet and pulled down all my wife’s prescription medications. To think I thought she was crazy for needing pills. I hoarded six different pill bottles to my chest as I tousled down the stairs. With each step my heel bounced with glee. 
When I made it to the bottom of the steps, it felt like Kyle’s swing and myself were pinned at the foot of the staircase at the far upper right corner of the living room. It was an entrapment. The trajectory of the slime went far beyond what I even felt was comprehensible. I stopped on the second to last stair, looking down at Kyle beside me. He was now quiet and numb as his tears had all dried up and there was nothing left to cry out. I started pushing and simultaneously twisting every child-proof safety cap off of the bottles. Soon one after another came a stream of white round pills. Some were flatter and smoother than others, slightly different shape to them, but generally speaking they were white and round. It must have been hundreds of pills all together littering the liquid red bubbling molten lava all around us. I swore I could hear a growl permeate from it as each pill fell into it.  As it began to bubble more and more it did not seem to recede, but moreso, started to grow taller. The bubbling built upon each other like a frothing cappuccino that kept exuberantly foaming. I started to choke on my own spit as I gasped so quickly in pure shock of this realization. I noticed Kyle’s eyes were like saucers and motionless. I could not even begin to imagine what he was processing this scene to be. I didn’t realize I was still holding onto one bottle left amongst all the panic in the moment. It was a refill that she never even had the chance to need or want. 
 It felt like with each bottle of pills, all the names were the same, just the letters were rearranged. Same sounds, new face. There was one pill left in the bottom of the bottle. I had to fight the intrusive thought of grabbing that pill for myself and sliding down my throat after all the chaos I had been through, but instead, I fought temptation. I was not going to succumb to her level. I held the clear orange plastic container outward and tipped it over between myself and Kyle. I then tossed the bottle in with it. However, an unexpected “pop” occurred that spouted a splash of hot red juice across Kyle’s face. It sizzled down the bridge of his nose and across his left cheek. Kyle’s switch from numbness to erratic screaming was instantaneous. The burn must have been similar to being popped by cooking oil that simply lingered in place on Kyle’s face.  It was horrific. I watched him wail until he only uttered silent shrill squeaks. His expression was mangled and twisted into terror and pain like wincing from a shot.  The bubbles continued  trying to get to Kyle’s feet. The blob was magnetized towards Kyle in the corner, foaming up around him as if corning to attack. He seemed so malnourished since his mom hadn't been feeding him and I tried to bottle feed, but it's just harder to get him to take. I’m not bloody sure what I am doing is even right in the first place. I would have killed a whole colony of rescued new born kittens at this point with the lack of skills in this area or nurturing that I displayed. I could deal with the silent screams and I was managing, but then I noticed his diaper was very soggy. I did not want to touch the thing. Why did Kyle have to be my responsibility and my choice and I had to do everything for him. I am not a mother. I can not be what he needs. Somehow after allotting himself to breathe for a few minutes he escalated into extreme terror that spiked and brought out a croaky choking as the foam grew around him ready to slurp him up. I needed to get him out of that swing and get him upstairs with Daddy. I knew the blob wanted him because Kyle was a part of her as much as he was me. 

Bargaining 

I remember the dumb shit that would come out of her mouth at the worst times. She loved calling me a “shitty dad’ and then would discuss how she wanted to kill Kyle while still half grown in the womb. She was pushing to eliminate him from her body like he was something she was not supposed to have, would not care for, and he would be better with the angels, hallelujah. As I looked down on Kyle now he seemed to be in excruciating pain, but struggled to make adequate noise due to fracturing his voice box with all the screaming earlier.
 He had been hooping and hollering since I took over caring for him on my own. I thought it was just missed feedings or lack of changing the diaper enough. I put him in a separate room so he didn't annoy me or stink. Now it was reasonable for me to see where his mother was coming from. Kyle is just a loud, dependent, screaming, shitting, burping, puking, unpredictable nightmare companion with half of my wife’s DNA inside of him. I thought that if I just jerked him up out of his swing with his one little arm and dangled him into the lava it might burn the demon half of him out of my life. The more I thought about it the more I thought about how helpful Charlie was. He was always there during the good times and bad times and trying to help out. Kyle was just part of the disease that festered onward and only hindered situations, not made them better. He was the catalyst of my wife’s pain. I did not want to be his dad. I was not ready to be a dad, especially not alone to that thing.
 I reached down and grabbed Kyle by his small tender left arm and pulled him up from the swing and brought him before me, but not letting him touch me directly. His eyes felt empty and void at this point, but he was also too utterly weak to fight back in any way. I know I could not bring my son in to get medical attention without causing a scene or some kind of judgmental commotion. I couldn't go through that. Not again. I chose to instead step back one more step as the gloop grew.  I held Kyle by his left arm as far from my body as possible and watched the red waters already bubble beneath his feet, foaming in desire. I did not know if I should just drop him in or do something more humanely. I thought about a batismal. A gentle dunk of the head and body underwater, but to never come back up. It still felt more right. I stripped him down to his diaper alone. Then Ripped it open so that the glob would have to eat his shit and piss first before its new tantalizing treat. The cat howled from within the gloop like a dog towards a moon at the prospect to come. I slowly dangled Kyle before me with his asscheeks smeared in feces and the stench making me want to gag. I was elated to start to unwrap my fingers around his little wrist. All I could remember was him choking on his own saliva at this point with all energy drained from his infantile body as he had fought so hard earlier in the day with the screams and tears. 
“He put up a good fight. Longer than I expected for myself,” was the memoriam I muttered as I had one more look at Kyle’s scarred face and empty eyes, as blue as hers.  I then lowered Kyle fully under the goop in baptismal fashion, except he was not going to come back up for air, reborn. Once the back of his throat gargled the last bit of air out of his lungs, it seemed like an immense pain was lifted. It stripped away this sharp shrill voice that had painted the air so heavily and the bubbles immediately died down as I felt a heaviness lift from within my chest. Upon the instance of deafening still silence, where even Charlie’s yowls were no longer heard, I realized it was only a temporary illusion of freedom, yet again.
Suddenly, a cry from a child full of vigor radiated through the entire home. As the crying child’s voice, Kyle’s voice, bounced off echoing walls of an empty home, the bloody water started to recede back into the kitchen. It was as if the crimson fluid on the floor had been absorbed back into Kyle’s body giving him new life as he sounded more loud and vocal than ever. The insufferable redundancy of the shrill crying without my son there to reach out to and tend to brought a whole new understanding of what silence and stillness can really allude to. Just when you are thinking everything is perfectly alright, maybe even better than it was before, everything comes capsizing down upon you with ten times the effort to break you than prior. There is no cheating in life's game. How could I toss my son aside soiled and unattended, abandoned in every sense, questioning if I walk around the corner if he would be dead in his swing encircled by flies. But does that make me worse than her? Does that make my thoughts worse than my wife’s thoughts? 
I had felt that if the red gratuitous gel was going to steal the one comfort that I had in all this and be happy about it, then why the hell wouldn’t a damn baby make it even happier. The truth was that neither made it happy. From the moment that the thought passed my mind there began a guttural cat’s meowing that built up behind the echoes of Kyle’s cries. To think that Charlie and Kyle could not be happy together wherever this red slime had taken them was devastating. Then how could there be any hope of happiness ever again for myself? 
The only benefit from losing Kyle was the lack of stench from his soiled diaper that was taken with him in the blob’s depths, and that the crimson pool did recede back some into a more controlled red gloopy substance. I could have more freedom in my own home once more, for whatever that limited boost of freedom was worth. The funny thing is that the gloopy substance actually left just enough room for me to walk to the dish that my wife made for me in pottery class when we started dating in high school. The piece of pottery was laid on top of the counter near the back kitchen door.

 She had made the pottery dish so that I could drop my keys in the dish, so I always kept it next to the door so I could never misplace them. She knew how many times I used to scamper looking for my car keys. My first job was delivering pizzas in my own vehicle and so misplacing my keys was common, but I was helpless and stupid. That one little imperfect pottery dish literally saved me from losing that high school job which led to more dates and eventually a wedding ring so she wouldn’t leave me behind for her dream University, as I could never reach her level of intelligence and achievement. I truly was not deserving of her. 

Currently in the pottery dish, there was a key ring with only the key to the garage on it and the key to the attic. The attic was a place we would put all our valuables, or the idea of where we would put valuables one day to keep them hidden and safe. It was like its own little safe room. I was quite proud of what I had created with the attic. 

She used to always talk about buying gold bars as we continued working and then storing them up there in the attic. And if anyone ever broke into the home, it would be the safest place to go and hide. The door was on the far side of the master bedroom. The door was flush against the wall that really could only be defined by the small lock and a thin seam. The door was hidden behind a wall tapestry that could be just gently pushed to the side. It was a tapestry of ancient Rome. She had always loved the idea of visiting one day its ancient architecture like the Colosseum and Pantheon. If she had chosen someone better suited for her then that could have been a honeymoon. Unfortunately I was far from making that dream come true, which is where the gift of the Rome tapestry came into play. Once the tapestry was lifted and the key was put into the chamber and turned to unlock, the door could be gently pushed open. The moment you stepped inside there was a tight windy short flight of stairs that twisted you upwards into the attic itself and all that it encompassed. A whole room of its own ready to be filled with golden riches that would give our lives security and eventually allow our dreams to come true. However, we were far from that point. It was practically empty at this moment. Almost empty, except for one thing. 
It was funny that the other key on that key ring went to the key to the garage. It allowed us to be able to lock up my car at night. Little had changed when it came to the importance of that car from when I was working and delivering pizzas in highschool or now when I delivered mail door to door. That car kept our lives from completely falling apart, kept our income just enough to get by and raise our blossoming family. This all kept the pressure entirely on me to make ends meet when the doctors said she had to be bed bound and not ambulatory but to the bathroom to shower or pee. I did not know if it was scarier to think about losing the car and thus my job and paycheck or to lose her and the baby. Everything was always for her, of course I was terrified to lose her most of all. I felt like maybe I brought a curse into her life by manipulating her to marry me with a cheap ring saved by three months worth of paychecks. She deserved better than me. 

Depression

The sounds of the cat’s screams and Kyle’s cries gradually became more like one monogamous wail of pain and agony withered into a single siren drawing me only further into its depths. I could feel meninges of my brain ebb and flow in sync with the blob itself like a debilitating pounding of an insufferable migraine with each and every continuous sharp pitched shriek. All this was emanating from only the continuously discontented blob of congealed red slop. As the sound of Charlie and Kyle’s deafening cries pulsated through my brain, I was also noticing the blob on the floor only begin to boil in its own juices more and more as the noise crescendoed. My ear drums began to reverberate with such an intensity to the point that when I held my hands over my ear canals in an attempt to muffle the racket, a dampness was felt. I pulled away my hands,  I saw that same crimson color that was adorning the ground against my fingers and dripping down my palm. I could not understand if what I was seeing was in fact real or this blob of unimaginable torture only further manipulating my brain with its intense cries to punish me for my mistakes.  I could not reconcile with it.  I tried to give it what I felt it wanted, Kyle, but instead it now tortures me for the decision of sacrificing my own blood, my son, in an attempt to subdue it. This felt like a lesson that had gone horribly wrong. I was not learning, but only making things worse. I knew it was not fair to hold my anger against Kyle for what happened to her, but it seemed like the easiest answer. The truth was always much harder to face. At this moment the bubbles within the liquid pool of red on my tile floor rippled into such a rapid boil that it began to foam up again. This time, though, the entirety of the red blob ended up transforming into this foam like a thick layer of bubble bath that was bright crimson red.  It was mutating itself into a whole new substance that had substantially more control over me than I wanted to admit. Even though it was confined to the kitchen floor at this point, it felt like its power was more incremental than ever before.
When I glanced back into the living room, pondering a means of escape. My body felt completely crippled and my guilt could not allow me to face the light of day. It started to settle in more  and more that I had not only tried to remove any reminder of my own wife’s existence from my life, but I tossed my son away as wellI and used him as a scapegoat for my anger. Hell, I used my wife’s hormonal misery as a scapegoat of blame. I was pathetic.
Suddenly, I noticed something round and white in the distant corner by the stairs that caught my eye. I could swear it glistened like it was winking at me to come near. It was a pill left over from my wife’s prescriptions that I had previously so haphazardly tossed into the blob’s depths. The single pill seemed to have survived the ordeal. I felt it was worth a try to just take that magical pill myself and maybe all the insanity, the shrill screams, will finally wane. The haunting cries that were so sharp it caused my ears to bleed seemed to pull me into some sort of purgatory of life and death as I was suffocated by the dead’s agony. Suffocated by the agony of those I loved. 
 I thought it would be easy to pull myself across the living room, but my body seemed to pull like a magnet towards the blob itself. This only reassured me that getting to that pill was going to help me, because the blob was trying to keep me away from it. That pill was going to bring back my sanity and so I fought with my small bit of might and willpower I had left to pull through the blob’s intense gravitational pull. I first braced myself against the wall and tried to use it as a brace to leverage myself forward. It got me halfway to the stairs, but when that no longer seemed to be enough, I dropped to my knees and curled my fingers like a phoenix’s talons and pulled myself away from the burning embers of that molten sludge as I dug into the floor boards crevices and pried myself forward against the walls molding. My nails chipped and bled in places as they would be used as the only leverage to pull myself toward the pill. The nails were my means of grip that could be wedged into the floorboards cracks. With each sharp break of a nail and the piercing pain, it was almost a welcoming distraction from the chaos around me and allowed me to focus even more intently on my goal, to get to that pill. When I finally was within reach, I elongated my right arm, like reaching out to the hand of God, and scraped the pill from the corner of the stairs leaving behind only a bloody finger print. I brought the pill to my mouth where I swallowed it with my small bit of collected saliva, hoping this was now all going to be brought to an end. 
The dryness of my mouth made the forceful swallow of that pill much more unpleasant as the outer powdered coating mixed with the floor's grit came off on my tongue and slid across my tastebuds. It was a bitter and sour taste in a way that was like drinking window cleaner mixed with an undertone of earthiness from the floor’s grime that had attached like black asbestos to the pill’s surface. I felt like it was almost how one feels when swallowing cyanide, but instead of my mouth filling with foam and impending death, it was the crimson monster behind me that continued throthing like the bubble bath of a murdered child. For a moment I felt like death itself would be quite pleasant. Anything to escape the agonizing pain that radiated in all areas of my being. I was physically crippled and mentally unstable pushed to that filthy floor I had not been able to entice myself to clean for weeks. I was simply rotting in my own filth of my own creation that only stewed this sense of misery and made the sweet calling of my demise so much more romanticized. I wondered if my wife would even hold out her hand to lift me up to her and embrace me if I was to die. As my self-worth continued to dip, I fretted on the thought of even being able to make it to heaven. If hell existed, maybe I was already in it.

The call for a surgery date was a little short notice but there was no way I wasn't going to take it, and immediately told my employers about the situation. I was unsure of the recovery time, thinking it would be a couple days to a week at most. Safe to say it was 6 weeks recovery and I'm still not 100% but that's beside the point. I had given a return date to my employers as recommended by my surgeon and went on short term disability. During that time I had not received any income from my disability claim because my employers waited until the last business day of my time off to fill out the forms.  When I did show up to work there was a new employee seated at the desk I usually sit at. There is a limited amount of office space to begin with and I often have to play musical chairs. This meant I now had no where to physically work at and offered to fulfill my full time hours from home. Needless to say I was not given full time hours while working from home. Fast forward to today, I am back in office and still not provided with a proper work space. Infact, while the new hire gets the office desk, my choice is the card table in the break room that holds the coffee maker or a dirty metal desk in the mechanics area that is used to grind metal. Also my job is a video editor where not only do I need to be free from distractions but I need to hear what I am working on. Two of my employers attempted to make me feel bad with remarks about how I didn't tell them I would be gone for two months. I am also being ignored by the other staff and treated like an outcast. When I asked about potentially making new office space they said that's not going to happen. And now I am being asked to sign papers I am not comfortable signing. I am so bad at confrontation that when I stand up for myself I feel guilty to the point of nausea. I'm not sure what my options are here but quitting is not an option for me, financially and morally.

1no6ro5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FromSeries/comments/1no6ro5/can_we_talk_about_food_and_toiletries/,Can we talk about food and toiletries?,"I wrote this before season 3. It still bugs me.

To my memory there are only 2 mentions of food in S1. In the first episode, Victor said ""something like all these years, the peaches are the one thing that stayed consistent"" meaning the cans were always there. Donna later implied she set some aside for him, but the commune has only existed about 2 years. In episode...3 I want to say Kenny mentions that they don't know where the coffee comes from.

In S2 (which takes place over the course of a few days), food shortages are mentioned. This could involve the community suddenly gaining so many new members. Donna, Tian and some others meet to pool cans at one point. The Commune has a greenhouse, but do they have the equipment needed to safely can low acid foods like meat and vegetables? 

Flashbacks showed that before Boyd became trapped, the captives spent their evenings hiding underground and trying to remain still. Assuming they slept in the day, this didn't leave much time for things like foraging and coming together to pool, plan and distribute resources. In these early days, how would they eat if food didn't magically appear? They werent even aware of the livestock until Boyd found them. How many people travel with several days of food them? The Matthew's showed up in an RV and Donna on a hunting trip, so they would have some. Do the powers that be strategically trap vehicles that have some rations?

In addition to food, what about toiletries? I can say from firsthand experience hair like Fatimas doesn't happen without special conditioner and 2 or 3 kinds of product. How are so many of the men shaving without cutting themselves on rusty razors? How are the ones with close shaved hair getting buzzed?

Medicine has been touched on. They've all but confirmed it doesn't appear as needed, though Kristy mentioned an ambulance came through once.

Last week, my coworker (let’s call her Anna) completely fried hers by spilling coffee all over it. IT said it would take about a week before she gets it back.

The next day, she comes over and asks if she can “just use mine” until hers is fixed. And then she says, “You can just work off your phone, right?” Like… what?? I honestly thought she was joking at first, but nope, she was dead serious.

I told her no, it’s my personal laptop, I need it to do my own work, and all my personal stuff is on there. She got kind of huffy and said I wasn’t being a team player and that if the roles were reversed, she’d totally lend me hers.

Now a couple of people are whispering that I should’ve just let her use it for a few days to help out. But I feel like giving someone your entire personal computer is way beyond “being nice.”

1no6mqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1no6mqz/am_im_making_the_worst_mistake_of_my_life/,Am I'm Making the Worst Mistake of My Life?,"im (21f) and im in an ldr with one of the sweetest, kindest, more courageous and resilient people I've ever met (m22). we've been together two and a half years now, and we met at uni. he told me firmly once that he's sure he'd like for me to be his wife one day. he's in the military too (its something that worries me and I'll get into that later). but I've been growing unhappy in our relationship slowly over time since last December and I don't know if its something I can continue to bear and hide.

to make a long story short, increasingly over time, I have been feeling the call to solitude due to many reasons. sometimes I just don't think I am the right person for him. I feel very imperfect and insecure about where I am in life at the moment, I remember hearing the saying that being in your twenties is being the worst possible version of yourself--and its something that keeps sticking with me.

I would consider us opposites, he's religious--I am not, he's traditional in the sense that he lvoes the basic things of life like nature and a warm cup of coffee and games like Tetris--the kind of things that would excite a seventy year old man. I'm truly a wild child, I love to explore, travel, visit new places and try new things as much as I can. he's a listener im the one chattering. he doesn't like to dance--I do, and I try to make him but he's conscious or all-of-a-sudden pained by a trick knee.  this is something that he does appreciate from me, although he doesn't voice it often..

politically we see eye to eye, however, in regards to the future and my true desires for myself we splinter greatly. I want to be self made, always on the fly. im also considering grad school as well, and the job I desire for the future involves a lot of travel but also a lot of money. I feel like there is a clock ticking down until I have to marry him, and although the idea of it makes me happy it also terrifies me greatly thinking of the things I may have to sacrifice to remain by his side.

that, and him and his best friend are platonic soulmates but so much so to where it's almost like I take a temporary backseat anytime he's with us.

the aspect of our ldr is strained as I have attachment issues that I am consciously (and have consciously) been working through--but sometimes I feel like he doesn't understand or truly head the significance of affirmations when we are apart. sometimes he can be stiff and cold, and after long days his frustration from others slightly rubs off on him to me. I am trying my best to be there for him, but it's hard to know what he needs if it's not physical assurance it's like a gigantic gap.

we've almost broken up simply once and it was because I was very irritated with how the distance almost kills the intimacy, but we have temporarily repaired things, but the sentiment for me seems to just not go away. our families are intertwined, I know people intimately from his church, and the mere thought of breaking up gives me immense anxiety--but I feel myself growing unhappy and wanting to break up.

am I just imagining a terrible ending before either can even happen? am I just being selfish? how do I know if im making the wrong choice? any advice would be appreciated greatly.",1,1758597223.0,Advice,8,0.67,False

I keep telling myself I'm writing this for anyone who likes to wander into the cosmos of their own mind like a warning, like a flare. Still, it could be me trying to pin the world to the page so it stops slipping.

Backpacking has always been my anchor. When I was a kid and everything got too loud, I'd take off into the woods behind our place in Georgia, walk until the cicadas turned into a single long sound and the air went cool under the trees. I liked how the forest swallowed noise. I liked how light got filtered through pine needles and spider silk. The Appalachians feel different than other places. It's not quiet like a library. It's peaceful, like the mountain is pushing its thumb on the pulse of the land and slowing down life.

Moving to Florida for work felt like getting relocated to a frying pan. Flat, hot, sticky. The air down here doesn't move; it sits and sweats. I can't see a horizon without a billboard stuck in it. But the mountains are only eight hours away if you leave in the dark and drive like your brain depends on it. So I do. I still do. Those trips back up to Georgia feel like going home to a version of myself I don't have to explain.

We planned this two-day trip for the past month. Jake, Brandon, and I. I should say it now: my name is Hunter. Jake's been my friend since we were dumb kids getting scraped up on BMX bikes. Ten years of knowing exactly how he'll react before he does. He's serious. Responsible but in that quiet way that makes you forget he's always taking care of something. Brandon is a later addition. Jake's buddy from college. Like a stray that started following us around and then refused to leave. Brandon's the guy who always has a story, and it's always half true, and the other half is the part that should have killed him. He recently dived into a hot tub at a party. He fractured two vertebrae, then stood up with his neck crooked, asking if anyone thought he needed a hospital. Somehow, he didn't die from the break, and even more impressively, he is ready to join us on a hike again, only a year later. He brags about stealing Aldi steaks like it makes him an outlaw. He's dumb lucky, and I never really liked him, but Jake did, so I put up with him constantly doing stupid shit.

Last trip out, Brandon tossed a lighter into the fire ""as a joke,"" and it popped and burned neat constellations into my tent fly. I patched them with clear tape like Band-Aids on a sky. For this trip, I went overboard with a new bag, a new headlamp, a new tent, and the best food possible. Two frozen steaks for the first night, wrapped in newspaper. A couple of astronaut ice creams that taste like powdered vanilla, but the nostalgia makes it worth it. I found a trail on Reddit that looked like a good one, with less traffic, better views, and steeper climbs than most routes. The thread had a poorly scanned topo map and a comment saying, ""worth it,"" which, in backpacker language, can cover anything from scenic to near-death.

I left on Friday before sunrise. Florida leaked away behind me in long, wet rectangles of light. By Valdosta, the air shifted. By Macon, the sky felt taller. Somewhere after Dahlonega, the hills heaved up into more than a slight hill that Florida calls a mountain, and my shoulders came down out of my ears. I called Jake outside Commerce, and he answered like I dragged him out of a pit.

""It's Friday?"" he croaked. ""Shit. Meet me at my house.""

Jake wasn't packed. Of course, he wasn't. He had ramen and trail mix and nothing like a tent. I tossed him my spare because it's easier than scolding him. We hit the grocery for fuel, and then Jake called Bill, our usual guy. Mushrooms were the plan. Instead, Bill said, ""I've got something new.""

He held up a zip bag to the light: little translucent black gummies with gold flecks suspended inside, like someone had ground up a wedding ring and poured the glitter into jello. He called them stoppers. Said they froze time, but not in a DMT leave-your-body way. ""You're still in the world,"" Bill said. ""Just… the world gets slow. Sticky. Like the second refuses to change.""

Twenty bucks a pop. Twice the usual. Jake didn't blink. My stomach did. Psychedelics in the backcountry are a dice roll on a good day; time dilation sounded like a dice roll with knives glued on. But I couldn't stop staring at those gummies. The gold didn't look like edible glitter. It looked like metal filings caught in a jellyfish. I said yes before I finished the thought.

We swung by Brandon's. Like always, chaos. His parents were in the house yelling, their voices hitting that too-familiar pitch old arguments have, the one that sounds like a fly trapped between window and screen. Brandon was on the porch drinking from a tall can, laughing at nothing. He had his pack, though. Credit where it's due. When we told him about the stoppers, he grinned like a kid and asked if he could take two.

""No,"" I said, and slapped his hand when he pantomimed snatching the bag. ""One each. We've only got enough for one a night apiece.""

He smiled like he agreed, and his eyes said I'll do what I want.

Up 19 to side roads, the Corolla is complaining like grandpa about every pothole. We stopped at a crusty gas station because the tank light popped on. Four pumps, two dead, a buzzing fluorescent light, and a top sign with the ""P"" in ""Pineview"" burnt out, so it read ""_ineview."" Two guys out front by the ice machine in those puffy jackets that always look damp and never look warm. One watched us while we pumped. He had that too-thin face and jittery jaw. He eased over when he saw the packs and asked, ""You boys going up Asher Mountain?""

We nodded. He shook his head like we'd told him we were swimming across an interstate. ""Don't camp up there. Not at night. Nothing good in those woods.""

Brandon snapped without missing a beat. ""We don't have shit for you, get the fuck out of here.""

The guy's mouth twitched. He spat near our boots and shuffled off, muttering. I told myself it was just the usual mountain lore. Appalachia collects stories like burrs collect pant legs. Every ridge has a thing, every hollow has a dead man's name. I've hiked enough. I've never seen anything but bear scat and people's trash.

The road into the trailhead turned to red clay and ruts. Rain earlier had slicked it to a paste that grabbed the tires and tried to kiss us into the ditch. Trees pressed close, pines and crooked oak, trunks dark with wet, beads of water trembling on leaves like held breath. The Corolla did that sideways slide a couple of times, where your heart falls through your feet, and then the tires grip and catch, and you pretend you didn't almost die.

Trailhead: a tilted wooden post, a bullet-pocked sign, a pull-off with enough room for three cars if everyone likes each other. Gray light under the canopy. The kind of light where a camera would turn the world to fuzz. We lit a joint and passed it, the smoke cut with that wet-leaf smell that always smells like rot and home at the same time. Packs up. Hip belts buckled. Click click. That little happy clatter of metal on metal that means you're about to disappear for a while.

I hadn't hiked this path before. The Reddit map said ""easy first half,"" but either they were lying or the forest decided to express itself. It was narrow, overgrown, a buckthorn slapping trail. Little wet branches whipped our arms and laid cold lines of water across our sleeves. The ground was all roots and hidden holes. The climb hit quick, a steep switchback that woke the lungs like a slap. We fell into the usual pace while going up the steep inclines of the Appalachians. Pass the joint, cough, laugh, and pass the joint. No one is willing to stop smoking and admit that their lungs are on fire from the climb. I can't complain, though, there isn't anything better than the smell of smoke and pine sap. It was getting slippery, though, and the dirt tasted like iron when it sprayed up in your mouth after a slip.

Brandon dropped half the weed in a puddle and swore like we'd pushed him. ""That was the good stuff, dude!""

""You didn't buy it,"" I said, but I was smiling because I was still soft enough to smile.

The fog rolled through in bands like ghost rivers. Sometimes it came up from the valley and slid through the trunks at knee height. Sometimes it hung in ragged sheets between trees, and you had to walk into it like a curtain into another room. When the wind pushed it, it went sideways, and the whole forest blurred like it needed to be wiped with a thumb.

By late afternoon, we climbed onto a ridge with a low rock outcrop. The view unfurled. Green layers of mountains, ridges stacked like old blankets, each one taller than the one in front of it. A vulture circled a lazy loop that made me jealous. I set up the little stove on the flat rock and thawed the steaks. The paper peeled off damp and left newsprint on the meat, which cooked away, and we pretended it made us smarter. Grease dripped, hissed, smelled like five stars. We ate steak and ramen and laughed at how good everything tastes when the air's cold and you worked for it.

Then the sky started bleeding purple, and the trees went black before the ground did. That's when I pulled the zip bag out. The stoppers shimmered in the firelight. The gold flecks woke up when the flames moved, pulsing like they were reacting.

""One each,"" I said. I meant it like a command. Brandon gave me his wide smile, like yes, sir, and still tried to sneak an extra one before my hand hit his head. ""Ouch, what the fuck, dude? I was joking!"" he shouted at me. ""I said one each stop being an asshat."" He dropped it after that and took his one.

The gummy hit my tongue, and my stomach dropped. Gasoline and pennies. There was a chemical top note like paint thinner and a rotten sweet underneath like cough syrup you left in a hot car. It stuck to my teeth, and I had to scrape it off with my tongue. Brandon made a face. Jake rolled his eyes and said, ""That can't be good,"" but chewed and swallowed and then raised his eyebrows like, ""Well, we're committed.""

At first, it was just the campfire. Pop, hiss, spark. The usual comfort. Jake told a story about a guy at work who printed thirty copies of his resignation letter and then forgot to resign. Brandon bragged about a girl who didn't exist. I let the noise move around me and watched the smoke. It went up. It did what smoke does.

Then it didn't.

The smoke folded. It bent like a ribbon being tucked into a pocket. It rolled back down into the flame like the fire had become a drain. The sparks didn't float up and outward. They shot sideways, a little golden school of fish that darted and grouped and then stayed in a knot like they were stuck in glue. I felt the first hair raise on my arms. I blinked, and the fire was like TV static — the gray fuzz of a screen an old set makes when you kill the channel, and it hums that low, electric hum you can feel in your fillings. The static ate the shape of the logs and gave back a rectangle of gray noise that looked like heat shimmering on the road, but colder.

Jake had a line of drool shining on his chin and didn't know it. Brandon's mouth fell open and stayed. His eyes were wet, reflecting the static like tiny screens.

""Does the fire look like that to you?"" I asked, and my voice sounded like I was under a blanket.

Brandon said, ""The fire's fine, man. It's the trees.""

We looked. I swear to you, the forest had straightened. The randomness you expect from the different gaps, the weird spacing, and the drunk angles were gone. The trees stood in columns and rows, lined up like pews in a cathedral, trunks in perfect alignment front to back. The gaps between them were identical, cut to measure. In the distance, rocks aligned too, each the same size, spaced like someone used a football field as a ruler and stamped them across the ridge: rock, air, rock, air. My eyes tried to slide off it and instead stuck to the pattern like burrs to socks.

Then I heard water.

It started like a faucet being turned on in another room. A trickle that tickled the ear. It became a stream, then a rush, then full-on waterfall noise planted just out of sight, the kind of sound you feel in your chest and your teeth. It was so obvious, so loud that I said, ""We need water anyway,"" like that was a reason to stand up. We stood up. We left the fire. The rows of trees made walking in a straight line feel like walking down an aisle at the world's worst grocery store. Every time I thought we'd hit a bend in the trail, the bend slid one aisle over, same distance away. When I looked back behind us, the camp was gone. I saw aisle after aisle of trunks, each gap the same. Our firelight was already a lie my brain had told me. The other didn't seem to care, so I just kept walking with them.

We walked toward the roar until it filled the world, and then, as if somebody flipped a switch. Silence. The kind of silence that makes your ears ring their own private sound because the brain refuses to accept anything. No crickets. No owls. Not even wind. Just our boots pressing wet leaves and coming up with that sticky kiss sound.

That's when I realized it was still dusk. It had been dusk when we lit the fire. It was dusk when we stood up. It was dusk right now, even though it felt like half an hour had slid by while the waterfall sound grew and died. The sky had stalled at that bruised color with no stars yet and no sun either, like a clock with its second hand glued down.

I cursed for not bringing my headlamp. It was in my pack. I could have grabbed it. I didn't. That stupid little decision started to feel like the hinge the night swung on.

Brandon licked his lips. They looked pale in the half-light, like someone had pulled the red out of him. ""Do you guys… still hear the water?""

""No,"" I said, and my voice came out thin. ""It's gone.""

We turned around to walk back, and the forest still hadn't changed. The rows stayed. The rocks stayed. The smell of our fire, meat, and smoke was gone. Our prints didn't show up. It was like we'd been walking on a new floor that rolled over the old one as we moved, covering tracks.

""Well fuck now we have to find our way back,"" I said as we started to move back. That's when I began to feel like something else was walking with us.

At first, it was footsteps that didn't match ours. Softer. The sound of small stones clicking against each other just to the side, like something with narrow feet was testing the ground. Then two of those. Then three. Every time we stopped, the extras stopped. Every time we moved, they resumed. Not in sync. Not echoes. Followers.

I didn't say it. Jake didn't say it. We tightened up without saying it, shoulders in, breaths shallow. Brandon kept glancing to the sides with his eyes only, his head locked forward like prey animals keep it when they listen for predators.

Then the forest started to talk.

An owl called. Not far. Not a deep night voice. A high one. Except it didn't hoot. It said my name. It pulled it apart into syllables like someone reading ""Huuun—terrr"" off a sheet of paper for the first time. The last r ticked in my ear in a long, dragged-out horror.

We froze. Jake's eyes cut to me. Brandon laughed without breath. ""You guys heard that, right? Tell me I'm not crazy.""

""It's just the drug,"" Jake said, but his jaw was locked.

A coyote yipped. Except it wasn't. It was Brandon's laugh, the exact laugh he'd made two hours ago when he told us the steak story. But it wasn't beside me. It was behind, somewhere down an aisle of trees. It sounded doubled, like it bounced around a long tube and came back as an echo, only the tube wasn't there. The hair on my neck turned to needles.

Brandon's smile fell off. ""That… that was me,"" he said. Not a question.

We walked. What else do you do? The silence between the noises was worse. My brain put a faint TV hum in there to cover it because it needed something. And then the woods did my mother's voice. Clear as day. The exact tone she used when I was twelve and out after dark. ""Hunter? Time to come inside."" From about two aisles over. I froze in place, but the others didn't seem to hear it. They stopped, and Jake asked, ""What's wrong?"" I quickly snapped out of it and continued, ""Oh nothing lets keep walking."" I didn't want to repeat what I heard, which felt like something I didn't want outside my mind.

We passed the same stump three times. I know it was the same because a thick branch came out at the same angle and broke off at the same place, and the moss on the north side did a weird hook shape that looked like a question mark. Three times. Ten minutes apart. We passed a fallen log with a split that looked like a grin. Twice. The trail didn't turn back on itself. I swear to you it didn't. It reused itself.

I pulled my compass. The needle went slowly. It started to point and then kept going, like syrup sliding around a plate. It did a full circle, tired, then another. We didn't have north anymore. I checked my phone. Forty percent battery, then sixty-two, then nineteen. The clock read 7:12. Then 7:13. Then 7:12 again. I wanted to throw the thing into the trees because it was pretending to be a clock and wasn't.

We stopped to drink water we didn't need. I looked at Jake, and something in my brain stepped back one inch. His eyes looked wrong. Pupils wide, sure, but there was a ring around the iris that looked like the ring on a coffee mug. His mouth hung a little more open than a resting mouth should. His shadow behind him stretched longer than mine by a lot, even though we were next to each other. I blinked, and he was him again, but the afterimage sat there like the halo you see after staring at the sun.

Brandon stared at him and his hand flexed like it forgot if it was supposed to be a fist. ""Why's your face doing that?"" he asked.

Jake sighed. ""What are you talking about?""

""Your eyes,"" Brandon said. ""They're not yours.""

We laughed. We always laugh because what else do you do when tripping balls?

The granola bar thing happened next. I pulled one from my hip pocket, unwrapped it, ate half, and shoved the other half back in. I remember the taste of peanut and stale honey and the way it scratches your throat. Twenty minutes later, I reached for it again to finish it, and the bar was sealed. New wrapper. No tear. No crumbs in the pocket. I held it up and played with the seam, like maybe I had messed up, and then my stomach turned, and I shoved it back like I hadn't seen it.

Brandon's eyes wouldn't leave me. He kept stepping so he could see my face from a new angle without being obvious. He did the same to Jake. He spun, walking backwards for a while, never turning his back to both of us at the same time. The footsteps that weren't ours adjusted with us, trying to keep up, and that was the first time I really wanted to yell. That need hit my throat and died there.

""You're not Hunter,"" Brandon said. Quiet. Like to himself.

I managed a laugh. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""Your voice,"" he said. ""It's not yours. It's… wrong."" He looked at Jake. ""And you, your eyes keep freaking out. ""You think I'm stupid? You're not..."" He swallowed like his mouth had dried out. ""You're not you.""

""Brandon, breathe,"" Jake said. Calm voice. The one he uses when I start spiraling. ""It's the drug.""

""The drug's not making the forest straight,"" Brandon said, and he gestured out at all the aisles. ""The drug's not making the rocks line up like someone measured space with a ruler and I—"" He choked on the next word. ""I heard you behind me, Hunter. I heard you. Laughing.""

""We're all hearing weird things, Brandon. It's just the drug,"" I said in a reassuring voice. Brandon seemed to calm down slightly, and we stumbled upon what looked like the clearing we had set up camp at. A wider patch in the aisles where the rows opened a fraction. A dead stump in the center, like a table. Our fire wasn't there. Nothing from us was there. But the ground looks the same everywhere when it's covered in oak leaves stamped flat and damp, and we wanted out of the aisles, so we stopped. Jake crouched, the old man crouch he does when he's thinking. Brandon kept to the edge with his back to the trees, and pulled his pocket knife out, flipping it over and over in his hand. I could smell iron, which might have been from my cut across the knuckle from a branch, or it might have been in the air. The sky refused to change. Dusk held.

""What time is it,"" I said, and it wasn't really a question. ""7:12,"" Jake said.

""It was 7:12 before,"" Brandon said. ""It was 7:12 an hour ago."" ""We haven't been here an hour,"" I said. My mouth lied. My body said we'd been walking a lifetime.

The clearing had sounds again. Not real ones. It was like someone put in a soundtrack and played it too quietly. Little clicks that wanted to be twigs snapping but didn't commit. A hiss that wanted to be wind but didn't know how to move leaves. Mimic sounds. You could tell by the way the hair on the back of your neck didn't know if it should stand up or lie down.

""Sit,"" Jake said. ""We're gonna ground and ride it out.""

Brandon laughed. Low at first and then high like a kettle. ""Ground? With you? With it?"" He pointed the knife. The point wobbled because his hand was shaking. ""You think I don't see it?""

""See what,"" I said, and the static hum climbed my jaw into the hinge of my ear.

""You,"" he said, and his voice split into two versions that almost matched. ""You're wearing him. Like a suit. Like a... like a deer skull on a man. You think I'm..."" He breathed hard. ""You don't even move right."" I didn't realize I had my hands out until I saw them. Palms open, fingers soft. The universal we're okay gesture you give to a skittish dog. ""Brandon,"" I said. ""It's me. It's Hunter. We ate steak and ramen. You spilled the weed and cried about it.""

His eyes flicked fast like a hummingbird. ""That's easy to say.""

Jake stood slowly. ""Brandon, put the knife down.""

""You say my name like that again and I'll cut it out of your mouth,"" Brandon said. He stepped right, just a hair, so we were no longer in line. He wanted us separated. He wanted our faces in frame one at a time so he could be sure. ""You think I don't hear you two whispering when I look away? You think I didn't see your shadow stretch wrong? Your teeth look longer when you talk.""

""Okay,"" Jake said. ""We're going to breathe. In for""

Brandon moved.

It wasn't clean. It wasn't a movie scene where the bad guy attacks you. He lunged like he forgot how to run and remembered at the last second. The knife came at Jake, low, clumsy, fast. Jake got an arm up and caught the blade across his forearm, a flash of red, a mouth opening in skin. I yelled and grabbed Brandon's wrist and felt the tendons under my palm jumping. He was strong. He twisted like his bones were greased. The knife skated. Jake shoved him, shoulder to chest, and Brandon laughed. That doubled laugh. Two voices almost on top of each other, so it sounded like a chorus with one guy out of time.

We hit the ground in a knot. Leaves in my mouth. Dirt in my mouth. That iron taste again. The knife came down toward my face, and I shoved the flat of it with my thumb, and it sliced the pad, and I saw white under the red for a second, and then my hand was hit out of view from Jake tackling Brandon. They rolled. They hit the stump. Brandon swung the knife and caught Jake shallow across the ribs, and the sound Jake made was like a dog being kicked, and my chest locked, and something inside me said rock.

There was a rock at my knee, flat, hand-sized, and wet. I picked it up. It felt heavy in a way rocks are heavy, but also in a way rocks aren't. I didn't think. I didn't reason. I ran to where Brandon and Jake were still on the ground and swung. It caught Brandon across the side of his head, and he went off, his eyes trying to focus on me and not getting there. The knife wobbled. Jake kicked it, and it skipped into the leaves, and I saw the gleam once and then not again. Brandon tried to stand and couldn't. He laughed again, except this time it wasn't two voices; it was three. His mouth didn't match any of them.

""Stop,"" I said. ""Stop, stop, stop, stop!""

He came again, one arm hanging, one arm clawed, and there was no more talking. Jake hit him shoulder-first, and they went down together. I brought the rock down again and again because my brain had become a single command that said Make him stop and didn't have room for anything else. There are noises you make when you lift weights: those came out of me. Then there are noises something makes when it breaks: I won't write those. We stopped when we were both too tired to lift our arms, and the hum in the air faded, and my hands shook like I was going into hypothermia.

Brandon lay back, looking at the canopy. His eyes didn't blink. His chest didn't move. The rows of trees behind him lined up like a barcode that went on forever. Jake's breath came in tears, little shreds. He pressed his hand to his arm, and it came away slick, and he looked at me like he was six and I could fix it.

""We have to..."" I said, and didn't have anything after that. We turned away for a second. Maybe we both did. Maybe only I did. We turned away because the blood looked like a map I didn't want to read. When we turned back, Brandon's body was gone.

We didn't decide to run. We just ran. The aisles blurred. The straight rows made a flicker-book of trunks on either side. Every four steps I looked back and saw nothing and saw everything, depending on how my lungs moved. The footsteps multiplied. The voices got smart. They learned our tones and gave them back wrong. ""Hunter,"" said Jake's twisted voice, from the trees to my right, casual like a friend at a party who wants to tell you a joke. ""Jake,"" said something that sounded like me from the left, soft, almost a question. The owl repeated my name and added Please.

I tripped and ate dirt, and a piece of a stick went into my palm and came out slick, and my hand didn't feel like a hand. Jake hauled me up by the back of my shirt, and we kept going. The rows repeated. We passed the stump with the question mark moss. We passed the log with the grin split. We passed the rock I'd used, or one that looked exactly like it, lying clean in the leaves. I don't know how long we ran. I looked at my phone and saw 7:13. Then I saw 7:12. This shit is never going to end, I thought to myself, and kept running.

At some point, I fell and didn't get up. The world narrowed to the size of two leaves and the thread between them. The hum in my teeth got louder until it was the only thing. Everything got dark like the dimmer turned down, not like a switch. The last thing I remember is my own voice calling from the trees. Not Jake. Not Brandon. Me. The exact way I sound when I'm tired and trying to sound like I'm not. ""Hunter. This way. Hurry.""

And I went. I didn't choose it. My body chose it. I tried to fight, and the world slid, and then it was gone.

I woke up in my bed. I tried to yell, but I had no air. All I could hear is my phone alarm doing the little chime I hate. Blind light striped across the wall. Florida light, flat and colorless. I stared at the ceiling, and it was my ceiling. I lay there and waited for Jake to lean over me and grab me, but nothing happened. I let my breath escape me in a laugh, letting my body push the panic out of me. It was all just some sort of twisted dream my brain made up. I turned over and turned off my alarm. The phone said Friday. The day we were supposed to leave.

It took me a minute to stand. My knees were stiff in that post-hike way like I'd been walking all weekend. My hip flexors did that little click thing. I told myself it was because I slept wrong. My palms ached. My left one burned when I curled it. There was a little tacky spot like a scab line. I told myself I scratched it on something here, at home, in the most normal place in the world. The calendar on the wall in my room said we were leaving today. The printout with the route and mile markers hung by a magnet on the fridge next to a shopping list that said eggs, toilet paper, and steak.

I went to the bathroom sink and turned on the tap. The water that came out sounded like a waterfall, a football field away. It filled the sink, and as I watched, it looked like TV static for half a second and then water again; normal, clean water. I looked at myself in the mirror. My pupils were a little wide, as if a room had dimmed. My mouth hung open just a little because I forgot to finish closing it. I stared at my eyes and waited for a ring to move across them like coffee in a mug, and it didn't. I laughed again, softly, and this time it sounded like someone else, and then it sounded like me again. I could go outside. I could get in the Corolla and drive north. I could knock on Jake's door, and he would open it, and be Jake, and I would be Hunter. We would laugh, and he would ask if I was ready to go. I would say sure, and then my brain would fall through a trapdoor. We would be standing on a ridge, eating steak, and watching a fire's smoke go up like it should instead of down, but when I went to the door to check the weather, I noticed my boots. They were my hiking boots in their usual spot, that I always leave them, but they were wrong. When I knelt down to look at them, I noticed there were tracks from the door that I hadn't cleaned up. Mud tracks, and there was mud on my boots. It was red Appalachian clay.",1,1758596499.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

-Shape: Portrait 
-Anti-description: extra limbs, extra arms, extra legs, 3 legs, 3 arms, extra eyes, extra fingers, 6 fingers, ugly


=Tags guide: 

-The reason everyone is 30-50 years old and has ""tall, mature, adult"" tags is because without them it makes the chars look too much like l*li/sh_ta if you use the anime filter. The older you go the more mature the char looks

-The ""human"" tag is for when you want the char to be [monstergirl](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/omniversal-battlefield/images/4/4e/Dragon_%28MGE%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20210710021430) or [kemonomimi](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/the-dere-types/images/7/70/Kemono_vs_Kemonomimi_vs_Juujin.png/revision/latest?cb=20231105213936) instead of full-on furry

-For the guys you have to specify ""flat chest"" if they're shirtless or else they might get tiddies. You also have to specify that they have nipples otherwise they'll be nipple-less like Ken dolls

-For manly muscle hunks you have to use ""very masculine, manly, rugged"" tags or else they'll default to bishounen

-For femboys you have to put tags like ""very handsome, adult man, slightly-androgynous, slightly-masculine, slightly-feminine, slender weak male build"" otherwise you'll just get girls. Srsly neither Flux nor Llama seem to know what a ""femboy"" is

-For male chars wearing very tight clothes, you might need to specify that they have a ""bulge in the crotch area,"" otherwise it'll look like they have nothing down there

-""thin sharp half-lidded eyes"" is optional, since it makes the eyes smaller and more proportionate instead of giving you those huge anime eyes

-""long nose, long chin"" are also optional. I use them for when it keeps generating small squished faces that are too cutesy-looking or too disproportionate to the rest of the char's body

Hope everyone is happy, healthy, and holding on for dear life. Cause I know I am. Wooh!!

So I have been prescribed Zoloft since March this year and very slowly made my way to 150mg which mentally and emotionally - this is a great dosage for me. However. That increase from 75mg-150mg, has me SO EXHAUSTED. I have officially been at 150mg for 4 weeks now. The energy decline is massive. I already take this medication at night and I’m usually wired for a bit after and then just crash - hard, but increasingly over the last 3 weeks. I have just felt so tired and exhausted and just the fatigue.

I traveled for a week and the amount of coffee and Red Bull I consumed should be illegal lol!! But the last three days alone just being off, I think I have successfully slept upwards 15-18 hours, yes, HOURS. A day. I’m still tired.

Anyone else have this issue?? I have an appt with my psychiatrist to discuss this tomorrow as I went and saw my Regular Dr. today - but he won’t touch any of my mental health issue things with a 10ft pole (bc my mental health team has got me covered lol). He did however do some blood work for other issues I’ve had in the past, but nothing has come back abnormal. The only other thing is my anxiety and depression has been slightly higher from 100mg to 150mg (of course moving at 25mg doses).",2,1758596155.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False

On Saturday I went to The Coffee Lab on 31st Ave as I walked by the open street. I was very disappointed that after purchasing a beverage and wanted to use the bathroom there was a sign in the bathroom that said “bathroom not working”. I wasn’t sure if this was a front for those who were not patrons, so I went to the cashier and asked her if the bathroom wasn’t working and she gave an indifferent reply and said “ehmmm no” and I said “is there a place I can go? Where do you go?” To what she reply “I just don’t”. Something tells me they just didn’t want people to use it and it really upset me because as a customer they didn’t show any empathy. 

On the other hand, on Sunday I went to Kinship near the park in Ditmarts and I got the tahini cappuccino. I am very hard to impress when it comes to a good cappuccino, but this was top 3 best in my life. That says a lot. Attention was great, open bathroom and such a nice place in general.

I started university for like a month. I am not kinda guy who easily likes someone. But somehow... I started to like her.

On the first week, I just find and texted her insta. We talked a little. She doesn't use insta much, so she always late replied. Yea.. already obvious that she isn't interested in me... I know. But what I have to lose? Second week, I bought her a coffee and bring to the class and gave her (I was literally shaking). I still remember her reaction... so cute. Then next week, after I texted her insta and she didn't reply for a few days, I decided to ask her number. I saw her on a cafe sitting alone, so I approached, we talked for like... half a minute. And yea.. she gave me her number. And that day... I texted her something like that ""Since you are not really into texting I wanna ask if it is okay for you if we meet up one day to chat"" And she just asked if I am interested in her... I said yes. And she kinda rejected me. But she didn't tell ""I don't like you."" It was something like that ""You are a sweet personality, but it is possible that I leave this university soon. So I prefer not to build so much friendships.""

So... the thing is that. It means one day if she decides to stay here.. we will still have a chance... or she was just trying to be nice while rejecting me?

I live with BPD, depression, social anxiety, and daddy issues. That means I get attached really quickly if I like someone. So please, if you're not serious about building a friendship (or more, if it happens naturally), don't waste my time.

About me: Age: 19 Height: 163cm, Weight: 55kg

Personality type: INFP-T

Escaping a toxic family situation soon and planning to seek asylum in London (I'm from Kuwait). That's why if things ever go beyond friendship, the person must be living in the UK and older than me. I don't want long-distance relationships.

I used to be Muslim, but l've left religion. I still believe in a Creator, just not in organized faiths.

What |like & value: Honest, genuine people who appreciate feelings.
Deep talks, not shallow convos or cold replies.

Space, astronomy, music (l'm obsessed with songs), nature, rain, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games.

People who can respect boundaries and give back the same energy.

love when people value me as much as I value them.

What I dislike: Narcissists (stay away, I can't stand them).

Fake, exploitative people - if I notice someone is using me, I cut them off like they never existed.

Surface-level friendships that disappear fast.
Important: If anyone tries to get close romantically: know that if I love you, l'll get very clingy, obsessed, and stalker-ish. If you can't handle that, better not even try.

I can be crazy and weird sometimes, and other times quiet and sad for no reason.
I'm shy in real life, and it takes time for me to feel safe enough to show my true self.

What I usually listen to: Melanie Martinez - Lana del rey - Billie Eilish - Cigarettes After Sex - Arctic Monkeys - Halsey - Radiohead - Aurora - Beach House - The Neighbourhood and more..

How do I make a better impression at work??","I’m 18F and I work at a coffee stand. I work with a lot of other women and girls under 18 and I have done my best to seem helpful and do my work. Recently, I’ve gotten multiple complaints about me being “rude”. As well as that I need to work on “my tone and delivery” I am a direct and honest person, and I come off blunt, but I really feel like I haven’t done anything wrong and I feel so lost. I feel like the fact I’ve been pulled aside THREE TIMES is really ridiculous, for my manager and myself. If it happens again I’m getting a write up.

I currently have the Breville dual boiler and am loving the coffee. Mailnly drink milky coffees. My issue is the grinder is so inconsistent (breville grinder in the duo pack it came with) and that the whole family uses the machine and there is constant mess around after grinding and frothing.  I’m so over it, I have 9 people in the house and I just want to be able to enjoy my morning coffee hassle free.  The question is, should I upgrade to the oracle dual boiler which I believe is an all in one and allows for the family to have their own profile, should I opt for a fully automatic one touch machine that grinds, tamps, pours and does milk with nothing left for me to do, or should I upgrade my grinder and keep my current machine for my own setup and get the rest of the family a separate setup?  I was even considering something cheaper along the lines of a delonghi or Nespresso pod machine with milk option.  I might add the others in the family are not the most patient and delicate at handling my machines hence my reason for wanting to change things up. They’re all tradies and get up super early and are almost still half asleep  t make coffee. If I’m up then I’ll make it but if not then it’s either no coffee or messy coffee, especially due to the grinder being inconsistent and the 3 step process!  
I should also mention that I like my coffee extra hot and medium roasts, I find fully automatic machines just don’t produce hot enough coffee and well, the flavour is obviously not as good as a regular machine i had a saeco 
I am open to any suggestions or ideas. I was also thinking about getting a whole new setup for myself along the lines of good grinder and machine. If a breville oracle dual boiler costs around 5000 au then I’d rather spend that on better different banded machines like emc, profitec. Thoughts please. I want to make this work!many many years ago and the coffees were very watery tasting. ",1,1758595430.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1no6170,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1no6170,Is the BSA audit really worth it?,"I work as HSK for hotels that are brands purchased by Marriott, one of them recently acquired. The internal management of workers and budgets is kept up to date and many times the brand promise cannot be fulfilled due to monetary issues of the owners rather than the worker. But when we have inspections, the auditors are extremely strict, and penalties arise. In my last BSA we got 70 points in cleaning just for having exposed metal on one of the chairs, since it had a part about 1 cm rusty, also the lack of 1 amenity since we did not have a suit protector at that time due to logistics issues from the corporate supplier and the carpet did not pass the white towel test (our hotel only does 2 carpet washes a year for budget reasons, and not 6 as the BSA requires), although it never found any hair on us; ratings in service and f&b we get 100 respectively 
I recently vacationed at 2 Marriott Corporate hotels, and was very surprised to find that they were worse than mine, including threadbare, worn linens, showers with scale and splattered walls, dirty window frames, small hairs between the mattress protector and sheet, and dusty furniture.
The second Marriott hotel I stayed at (Saturday, September 22) didn't even have a coffee maker (when I put the water in, it started to leak through the base and I had to dial twice in 90 minutes), the hand cream had a tab, the floor wasn't swept, and not to mention the gray dust and heavy lint in the closet. They had a BSA audit 2 days ago (my partner is also a hotelier and he found out that the front desk manager was an old college friend) and they boasted that they had a 98 rating.
You can imagine what a shock it was for me to see so many problems in the room and service even with that rating.
So, well, I don't know why there is a difference in ratings between one audit and another, even if it is Marriott.

O nome é Cinemoon, um site onde você pode assistir filmes, séries e animes gratuitamente.

Basicamente, assim como a maioria dos sites de filmes piratas, o Cinemoon é um indexador, ele indexa o conteúdo de CDNs externas e lida com as informações das produções através dos seus respectivos IDs IMDB e TMDB.

O Cinemoon possui uma automação que roda no servidor em conjunto com o site, adicionando, automaticamente, novas produções.

Futuramente, queremos adicionar mais funcionalidades ao site, e trazer interatividade, como sistema de avaliacão interna, comentários, favoritos e playlists.

Você pode exportar todos os IDs (IMDB e TMDB) contidos na base de dados, a opcão de exportação está acima do Header.

Colocamos também uma opção de doação, pelo Buy Me a Coffee. Caso queira enviar alguma quantia, para ajudar com a estrutura ou só incentivar a continuarmos com o projeto e aprimorá-lo, seremos gratos!

i'd sit in the cafeteria eating my donuts and having a coffee with whatever local newspaper was available because i don't think i'd gotten into sudoku yet.  i'd look for any local events for the day or near future and do puzzles or whatever.  i remember seeing once that there was a cat show at a facility that was about a block away from the mall and it was going on in a few hours.

this facility had a skating rink, too, and that was another place i'd kill time throughout the day or sit in to watch practice.  i was never asked to leave and it's a public building so... why not.  i'd just hang out, maybe mess around on my phone, read if i had anything interesting going at the time, listen to music.  it wasn't my favourite place to be, but i did go there now and then.  anyway, the cat show was in the basement.

i'd been a little concerned i wouldn't be able to find this section of the basement even though it's not that big a building, but by the time i reached the bottom of the staircase, all i had to do was follow the sound of meowing.  there was *a lot* of meowing, like, way more and way louder than i expected.  i love cats, so this was great.  i don't remember every specific cat that caught my eye but there was this one who reminded me a lot of my cat oscar because he just *knew* he was the shit.  you could see it on his little face.  no doubt in his mind.  he was sitting in his... i guess you'd call it a cage, but it would be more like 'suite' or 'penthouse' like '*jealous?*'

i saw a bit of the judging but have to say these people were *really* serious about their cats and there seemed to be a bit of an etiquette, which i broke a few times.  i felt revealed as a non-cat shower, got a little uncomfortable and left.",45,1758594984.0,BenignExistence,2,1.0,False

Me (42F), husband (43M), 2 kids (ages 7 and 9) 

Sex was decent when dating- not the best I’ve ever had but enough. I married him because I knew he’d be a good provider, a good father, stable, he makes me laugh, he is a good human and I feel in love with him and all of that. He is a sweetheart. I felt like I finally found a normal partner (my relationships prior were full of fire in the bedroom but also tumultuous). 

The sex dwindled during the first few years after becoming parents- I was nursing and exhausted- he traveled all of the time for work. It didn’t register. About a year or so after kid 2 was born, I started to notice that he was peck kissing me, tight lipped- and I asked “why do you kiss me like that?”.  No reply. 

It all continued to go downhill. When we did have sex (super infrequent) - he couldn’t keep it up. When he could keep it up, he finished and left to go wash off and left me hanging in the bedroom to finish off myself. I would ask him to get involved and he did so without more intercourse and truly it felt like out of obligation and a chore. I’d get off thanks to my own doing but I always felt so undesired. 

I urged him to see his doc about ED. He did and the doc said “try a healthier lifestyle and if that doesn’t work, we will talk again”. He didn’t follow thru much on the healthier lifestyle and the sex continued to dwindle. He would initiate in the middle of the night in a dark room- I told him he was a “sleep sexer”. It was weird! 

I found porn on his phone of a woman masturbating in public- I said I can’t believe you’re watching porn without me while you won’t have sex with me. I asked if that is what he was into — I said if that’s it for you- why don’t you share it with me so we can do stuff together? It was if he was embarrassed. He never brought it up again. 

Over the last 4 years, I’ve suggested pills, toys, therapy. He has not responded to any of these ideas. 

At one point, in an extremely rare vulnerable moment on his part (after attempted sex and ED), he shed a mere tear (he is very emotionally unavailable) and said “this has happened before in a prior relationship. I think something happened to me when young and I have blocked it out” I think he was implying sexual abuse but he didn’t come out and say it. I was extremely supportive and held him and I said you can get help to overcome this. This was years ago, I’ve been in therapy on my own for over 2 years and constantly share how it’s helped me in so many ways. I  have reminded him to start therapy multiple times, I’ve emailed him links to therapists, etc. he recently told me he wasn’t investing his time in therapy bc he was investing it in something completely unrelated (a medical issue he wants to get under control). I was devastated bc it shows me that he is actively choosing NOT to go to therapy— he should focus on the medical issue but can’t someone do two things at once? 

There have been several instances where I have just angrily blown up at him “why don’t you have sex with me!!!??”. I’ve asked him 2x if he was gay. He didn’t answer that question and he never really talks to me about it - it’s me just talking to him and he says nothing. We clearly have a communication breakdown. But it’s not from me, I have tried each and every way to communicate- it was soft and gentle at first, then I was pissed and now I’ve checked out. 

At night now, after kids are sleeping, I just stay downstairs and watch TV while he falls asleep alone. This has been happening for at least a year now most nights. He doesn’t join. Sometimes, we do watch a show together and laugh at the show in bed. we do the obligatory hug and peck upon leaving and greeting but that’s about it. 

I accidentally had somewhat of an emotional affair with a guy friend - nothing physical and it was brief- but the dude started calling me all the time and saying really fun and subtly flirting things to me. He would call and I’d literally walk right out of the room laughing that I was in with my husband to talk to this guy. That guy just kind of filled my cup for a bit - don’t talk to him anymore- but it was interesting bc my husband never got jealous or said a peep! I was like how does he not see that I’m having a little flirting! 

If I get dressed up, husband will say you look nice. He brings me flowers on special occasions. He brings me coffee. We maintain a solid partnership and we’re good parents. It’s just straight up Dead bedroom hard core. I’m sad for him and me both because a life without that intimacy and fulfilling sex- well it sucks. 

But at this point, I feel like he’s lost me in that regard. After years of this neglect and him not taking any action after all of my attempts at communication— I can’t imagine myself being able to “go there” with him again. Unfortunately, I don’t look at him the same. I’ve even verbalized to him that our relationship now just feels platonic (I got no response to that one, either, literally no feedback) 

I wish it wasn’t the case bc I really don’t want a divorce for soooo many reasons - too many to list. 

I’ve explored discussions of poly, ENM, and open relationships in therapy. All of them sound wonderful because I’d get what I crave in some sort of situationship — but for the life of me, I can’t imagine have that conversation with him if we can’t even properly discuss our own dysfunction, ya know? 

I also don’t even know if I have the spoons to bring it back up to him YET AGAIN. How many times does one person have to beg to be seen?! 

So here I am, at a loss how to move forward, in my prime HL, before the dreaded menopause I’ve heard wrecks havoc on a woman’s Libido, I feel like I need to do something soon or else this is just something I have to accept but I fear it will eat me alive, as it already has been. 

If you’ve read this far, thanks. I just needed to get it all out.

The jingle of my alarm dragged me out of a shallow, restless sleep. I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing the heaviness from my eyes before shuffling toward the bathroom. Cold water splashed over my face, sharp and bracing, chasing away the last traces of fatigue. I gazed at my reflection In the mirror, a faint shadow of stubble crept along my jaw. Brown eyes half-lidded, and my blonde hair stood in electrified disarray.

After scarfing down a banana for breakfast, my phone buzzed. Right on time, I thought, pressing it to my ear.

“Hey, sleepyhead,” came a familiar singsong voice, dripping with sarcasm. “I’m outside. You ready to go?”

“Yeah, just about,” I replied, my voice still heavy with sleep. “Just need to grab my bag—I’ll be down in five.”

“No problem, bud,” the voice shot back, teasing as always.

I couldn’t help but crack a smile as I hung up. I grabbed my hiking bag, gave it a quick once-over to make sure nothing was missing, then slung it on my back, locked the door, and headed outside.

James was waiting on the curb in his Tacoma. As I approached the truck, I noticed an open can of Monster Energy sitting in the cupholder. Knowing him, he’d already drained half of it.

“Hey there young man,” James called with a wicked grin as I got closer. “How much do you charge for an hour?”

After tossing my bag in the back and climbing into the passenger seat, I smirked and shot back, “Fuck off.”

Satisfied, we began the long four-hour drive to the Sunshine Coast Trail.

I was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. The Pacific Northwest has always been my home—a place of towering evergreens, mist curling through the valleys, and the kind of crisp, resin-scented air that clears your lungs with every breath. For as long as I can remember, those deep woodland greens have given me comfort.

It wasn’t until a few years ago, though, that I began to explore the land more deliberately. Hiking started small: modest 6 km (3.7 mile) trails, the kind you can finish in a morning and still be home in time for lunch. Gradually, my ambitions stretched farther. I found myself drawn to more demanding treks, and each year, I raised the stakes a little higher. Each trail left me hungry for the next. This trip was no exception.

The longest trail in Canada, Winding Snake trail stretches a whopping 180 km (112 miles), winding through a remarkable variety of landscapes—ancient rainforests thick with moss, rugged alpine ridges, quiet coastlines, and hushed streams tucked into shadowed valleys. What sets this trail apart is its hut-to-hut system. Scattered along the route are roughly sixteen backcountry huts, each offering weary hikers a roof and a place to rest before continuing their journey. It was mid September, where the weather was just starting to cool, and summer relented to fall.

The goal was to complete the hike in ten days. It should have gone off without a hitch—*should have been* the key word.

The Tacoma rumbled onto the highway, its tires drumming a steady rhythm against the asphalt. Morning light spilled through the windshield in golden bands, flickering as we passed stands of evergreens. The city fell away behind us, its concrete and noise replaced by winding roads, mist-hung valleys, and the occasional glimpse of ocean winking silver through the trees.

We rolled the windows down, letting the air rush in—cool and damp, carrying the faint tang of salt from the coast. James nursed his drink, one hand on the wheel, while I leaned back against the seat, letting the hum of the engine and the blur of passing scenery pull me into a quiet calm.

“How’s Kelly?” I asked after a few moments of comfortable silence.

“She’s great!” James lit up instantly, his voice warm and unguarded. “We’re still figuring out when to hold the wedding. And she’s only a year away from finishing her master’s in engineering. I swear, man, she’s the smartest person on the planet.”

I could hear the pride in his voice, and I was genuinely happy for him. Still, a flicker of envy stirred in my chest. He was engaged; I was still single. He owned his apartment, I rented mine.

I know they say comparison is the thief of joy, but I couldn’t help myself. James had always seemed a step ahead. In the last couple of years, I could feel him drifting further from me, which is part of why I leapt at the chance to do this long-ass hike together.

He moved to BC from Newfoundland when he was seven. On his first day of elementary school, I saw him sitting alone, absorbed in a set of plastic dinosaurs. I walked over, asked if the T-Rex could beat the Triceratops, and just like that, we hit it off. Nearly twenty years later, we’re still best friends.

At 6’3 and nearly 230 pounds, James was hard to miss. A true Newfoundlander through and through, with thick brown hair covering most of his body and a beard that seemed to grow faster than he could shave, he looked less like a man and more like some wild thing dragged in from the woods. Though he had grown a bit of a paunch in recent years, a near decade of playing rugby ensured his cardio was on par, if not better, then mine.

The rest of the drive passed in an easy blur. James and I talked about everything and nothing—the newest video games, ridiculous animal facts, half-baked political takes. The conversation wandered without direction, the way it always did, but that was the comfort of it. With James, nothing was ever off the table.

About an hour from the trailhead, we rolled into a lonely gas station off the highway. The neon sign buzzed faintly in the morning haze, promising fuel, coffee, and sugar in equal measure.

“Want anything?” I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt.

“Another Monster and some beef jerky would be great,” James said.

I snorted. “With a diet like yours, how are you still alive?”

He didn’t even blink. “Spite.”

I shook my head and pushed open the door while James stayed behind to fill up the truck. Inside, the air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and cleaning solution. I grabbed a Monster, jerky, a couple protein bars, candy, and two muffins, piling them into my arms before dropping everything onto the counter.

The cashier looked ancient, her face a map of deep lines, her thinning gray hair twisted into a bun at the back of her head. She moved slowly, methodically, scanning each item one at a time. While she worked, I let my eyes wander. Behind her, tacked to the wall, was a cluttered community board, its surface crowded with fading flyers and curling papers. One of them caught my eye—a missing-person poster, tacked crookedly to the corkboard. Unlike the faded garage-sale ads and yellowing church notices, this one looked fresh, the paper still crisp, the ink dark. Two faces stared back at me.

 One was a man, he looked to be in his early fifties, shaggy black hair streaked with gray and stuffed beneath a baseball cap. The photo had been snapped mid-laugh, probably at some game—his wide grin a frozen moment of joy.

Beside him was a younger boy, maybe eighteen. His photo seemed more candid, taken at a beach. Shirtless, slightly pudgy, his ghost-pale skin stood out against the sunlit backdrop, a sharp contrast to his shoulder-length black hair that clung damply to his neck. His eyes were wide, unguarded, brimming with an innocence that felt almost out of place against the somber context of the poster.

Beneath their photos, bold block letters read:

**MISSING**  
Ronald Varg (52) and son, David Varg (18).  
Last seen: July, traveling Winding Snake trail  
If you have any information, please contact—

“Such a shame,” came a withered feminine voice, jolting me out of my thoughts.

I looked up. The cashier had paused mid-scan, her wrinkled hands hovering over the register. “They came in here a couple months ago,” she said, shaking her head slowly. “Seemed like such nice folks. Damn shame about that bear attack.”

My eyes narrowed, refocusing on her. “You think a bear got them?”

“That’s what they’re saying.” She leaned forward slightly, as if letting me in on a secret. “They found their camp about three-quarters of the way up the trail. Tent ripped wide open—huge hole in the side. Bits of bone, clothing, dried blood… scattered all over the place, but no bodies.”

There was a strange lilt to her tone, a spark of excitement threading through the horror. Out here, I guessed, stories like this were currency. Company was rare, and tragedy—even second-hand—was something to talk about.

She straightened up, shaking her head again. “If it wasn’t a bear,” she said, her voice trailing off into something almost gleeful, “then I don’t know what could’ve done that kind of damage.”

“I guess I’ll keep my eyes peeled” I said with a half-hearted chuckle, eager to steer us away from the topic.

The old woman gave me a knowing nod, her expression unreadable. She slid the last muffin across the scanner, the machine beeping sharply in the quiet store. “That’ll be twenty-six seventy-eight,” she said.

I pulled a couple crumpled bills from my wallet, trading it for a thin paper bag that sagged under the weight of caffeine and sugar. The cashier handed me my change with papery fingers, her eyes lingering on me just a moment too long, as if she wanted to say more but thought better of it.

“Have a good hike,” she finally said, the words carrying a weight that felt more like warning than farewell.

As I stepped back into the morning light, James was just sliding the fuel hose into its holster. He noticed me coming and lifted his brows in a quick, wordless greeting.

“Got everything?” he asked once I tossed the bag of food onto the back seat.

“Yeah,” I said, shutting the door. I then told him about the cashier, the missing persons poster, and her story of the shredded campsite halfway up the trail. As I spoke, James kept his eyes on the road, his usual smirk fading into a more thoughtful line.

When I finished, he let out a long breath through his nose, then glanced at me, one hand tightening slightly on the wheel. “Sounds like a hell of a way to go, doesn’t it?”

The rest of the drive we tried to outdo each other with tales of the worst ways to die—being eaten alive by swarms of insects, or slowly flayed, or boiled alive. Each story got darker, more grotesque as the truck groaned into the parking lot outside the trail head.

James hopped out of the truck and began rummaging through his bag.  
“Two seconds, buddy,” he muttered, digging around with the focus of a man who had buried treasure in there. “Promised I’d give the old battleaxe a call when we got to the trailhead.”

With a small grunt of triumph, he pulled out a satellite phone. It wasn’t anything fancy—scuffed casing, bulky antenna, the kind of tech built for utility, not looks. He began thumbing the buttons before stepping a few paces away for reception.

James stepped a few paces away, holding the bulky satellite phone like it was some sacred relic. He jabbed at a few buttons, waited, then spoke, his voice low and clipped so I couldn’t make out every word.

“What are you wearing?” he growled, a shit eating grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Yup, all good so far, no issues. Yep… yep, we’ve got the food, the gear… everything’s set.” He paused, listening, then nodded. “Don’t worry babe, we’ll check in every couple day. Love you too.”

He ended the call, sliding the phone back into his bag with a satisfied nod.

I watched him, noting the faint tension in his shoulders as he exhaled. It was the kind of precaution that reminded me we weren’t just heading into a normal hike. Out here, the wilderness had its own rules. Then we set off.

When planning a long, multi-day hike, every ounce counts. Too much weight on your back and every step becomes a slog. James and I had tried to plan for everything, weighing each item against its necessity.

My pack was a carefully curated collection of essentials: food—mostly canned, dried, smoked, or bagged goods like trail mix, oatmeal, and candy—water bottles, a couple changes of clothes, lightweight tent, sleeping bag, flashlight, first aid kit, small hatchet, can opener, and bug spray, and a water filter bladder.

It was a simple yet brilliant design: fill the bladder with water, hang it from a tree, connect the tube to your bottle, and in ten or fifteen minutes, you had clean, safe drinking water. The thing was almost magical in its simplicity, a little slice of civilization in the middle of the wild.

James’s pack told a different story. Where mine was organized and precise, his seemed to reflect his personality: big, bulky, a little chaotic, but somehow perfectly functional. He had his own food stash—energy bars, beef jerky, a half-empty bag of chips he insisted “was essential”— lightweight lantern, a small cooking skillet, and a sleeping bag stuffed into a compression sack that looked like it had seen better days.

Despite the differences, it worked. Our packs balanced out in weight, and more importantly, they reflected the balance between us—my meticulous caution, his laid-back confidence. Together, we were ready to take on the trail.

The first couple of days passed uneventfully, almost peacefully. Birdsong drifted down from high in the canopy, bright and melodic, though the moss-draped branches often kept the singers out of sight. Sunlight spilled through the leaves in shifting patterns, warming patches of the trail while leaving others in cool shadow. More than once, we lost the path—the trailhead wasn’t always obvious—and had to double back to find it. The dense trees made navigation tricky, every direction blending into the next. I could easily imagine a less experienced hiker getting hopelessly turned around out here. The air carried the earthy scent of damp soil and pine, grounding us in the steady rhythm of the hike. The miles piled up beneath our boots, and we felt like we were making solid progress.

On the third day, James and I sat on a downed log for a quick water break when his eyes lit up suddenly.  
“Oh! I completely forgot to show you something,” he said, nearly bouncing with excitement. Digging into his bag like a kid on Christmas morning, he pulled out a flare gun.

“Where the hell did you get that?” I asked, a grin spreading across my face.

“Cabela’s,” he admitted almost sheepishly, like it was some guilty indulgence.

The thing was hard to miss: a bright blood-red barrel, a polished brown stock, and a hammer painted a glaring shade of yellow.

James cradled it carefully in both hands, his grin never fading. “Already loaded,” he said, as if reading my thoughts. “For emergencies.”

“That safe?” I raised an eyebrow. “What if it goes off in your bag?”

He shrugged casually. “Then I’ll probably burst into flames,” he said, deadpan.

I blinked at him, torn between being horrified and amused. “Alrighty then,” I muttered, shaking my head with a crooked smile.

James just laughed and tucked the flare gun back into his pack like it was the most ordinary thing in the world. Around us, the forest remained hushed and indifferent, as if it hadn’t heard a word. We hoisted our packs and set off down the trail once more.

Each day we covered roughly thirty kilometres, our legs aching but our spirits buoyed by the sheer beauty around us. Streams tumbled across the path, their water crystal clear, and we often stopped to fill the water filter, then fill the bottles. By the end of the 5th day, our progress had brought us to Elk Lake Hut. Nestled beside the still, reflective waters of the lake, the hut looked even smaller and more inviting after the long hours of walking. The lake mirrored the surrounding peaks and trees, creating a perfect, almost surreal frame around the simple wooden structure.

We dropped our packs with a collective sigh of relief, the tension of the trail momentarily slipping from our shoulders. For a moment, all that existed was the gentle lapping of the water, the croaking of frogs, the rustle of leaves in the breeze, and the quiet satisfaction of making it this far. Elk Lake Hut would be our home for the night, a small sanctuary in the heart of the wilderness before we pushed onward.

The inside it was simple, but it carried a rugged charm. The walls were raw timber, their knots and grains catching the light like scars in old skin. On the far wall, a small wood-burning stove squatted on a metal plate, its surface blackened from years of use. A half-empty box of matches and a bent fire poker lay on top. Along two walls were wooden bunks, one next to the other. Each was fitted with a thin foam pad, the kind that made sleep possible but never luxurious. Carved initials, dates, and little messages were scrawled into the wood next to the beds—testaments to the people who had passed through before. *“2017 – Mike was here”* sat beside *“Cold as hell but worth it”*, and beneath that, a crudely drawn moose.

The windows were streaked with dirt and condensation, but through it you could catch the glimmer of water, still and dark under the fading light.

“Not bad,” I muttered, more to myself than to James, running my hand along the rough timber wall. “Why don’t we start a fire in the stove and have ourselves a cooked meal?”

“Sounds good to me,” James replied without hesitation, his stomach giving a dramatic growl at the mention of food. He smirked, patting his gut. “If you wanna chop up some wood, I’ll cook it up. First, though, I gotta call my girl.”

I wandered toward the treeline, scanning for dry sticks, while James ambled down toward a small dock that jutted out over the pond. The dock was old—boards gray and splintering, nailed together more with stubbornness than integrity. I watched him idly from the corner of my eye as I hacked at a branch, the sharp crack of wood splitting filling the still air. James pressed the phone to his ear and started pacing the dock, muttering something under his breath, probably waiting for a signal.

Then it happened. Without warning, one of the boards gave way with a sickening crack. His leg plunged straight through the rotten timber.

“Fuck!” James bellowed, lurching sideways. The satellite phone flew out of his grip, arcing just long enough for both of us to realize what was happening before it splashed into the dark water below.

“Shit!” I dropped the sticks and sprinted toward him, but James had already wrenched his leg free with a savage tug. Before I could tell him to leave it, he leapt straight into the pond after the phone.

The water came up to his chest, sending ripples racing across the surface. He froze for a second, sucking in a huge breath, then plunged his head and shoulders under. Bubbles foamed up where he disappeared.

Seconds later, he erupted from the water, gasping and sputtering, hair plastered to his face. In one dripping fist, he held the satellite phone triumphantly above his head like some absurd prize.

“Got it!” he croaked between coughs, water streaming from his beard and clothes.

“You good, man?” I asked, trying—and failing—to stifle the laugh bubbling up in my throat.

“Yeah, I’m good,” James grumbled, dragging himself out of the pond, boots squelching in the mud. He held the dripping satellite phone like it had personally betrayed him. “But I think this thing is fucked. Waste of three hundred bucks.”

“Let me handle dinner tonight,” I said, trying to soften the sting of his embarrassment. “I don’t have any rice to put it in, but I do have oatmeal. Maybe it’ll suffice?”

James barked out a laugh, shaking his head. “Yeah, maybe. Worth a shot.” He sloshed past me toward the hut, leaving a trail of muddy footprints. I clapped him on the back as he went, his wet clothes squishing with every step, and he gave me a sheepish grin before disappearing inside.

I turned back to the dock, hatchet still dangling loosely in my hand. That’s when I froze.

Across the pond, half-hidden in the trees and the fading light, a figure was watching us.

It stood unnaturally still, its skin pale as bleached paper, like it hadn’t seen sunlight in years. From where I stood, the distance blurred its features into something unsettling—like a face you know is human but can’t quite recognize. My stomach tightened, a cold ripple running through me.

The figure then turned abruptly, vanishing into the dense treeline with a hurried shuffle.

I stood there for a long moment, the forest suddenly too quiet. The ripples on the pond smoothed into glass. Only the distant call of a raven broke the silence.

I got the fire going in the stove, occasionally using the fire poker to shift the brung wood,  the first lights of flame crackling to life before spreading into a steady warmth that filled the tiny shelter. James had stripped down to his underwear, his wet clothes draped on a nearby chair in front of the stove, Hopefully, it wouldn’t be long till the fabric dried. He sat slouched on one of the bunks, the battered satellite phone in his hands, poking at it with the kind of stubbornness only born from pure frustration.

“She’s going to be so pissed,” James muttered. “She probably thinks I was attacked by Bigfoot or something.”

“That’s a good way to go,” I teased, stirring a can of pork and beans on the stove until the edges bubbled. “Ripped apart by a mystical beast. Beats dying of old age.”

James snorted but didn’t look up. I poured a portion into a dented tin bowl and handed it to him. He accepted it with a grumble of thanks before digging in.

“Leave it in the oatmeal for a couple days, might do the trick,” I said, half-joking, half-serious, nodding toward the phone.

James gave me a sidelong glance. “Oatmeal resurrection, huh? Worth a shot.”

I cracked the stove door open, tossed another stick onto the fire, and listened to the wood snap and hiss. The hut was warm now, almost cozy, but my eyes kept flicking back toward the window—out into the darkening trees where the pale figure had been.

Later that night, after we’d eaten and James had finally given up on the phone, it lay in a baggy of oatmeal next to his cot. We lay in our bunks listening to the stove’s steady crackle. Sleep came slow.

Somewhere outside, a twig snapped.

My eyes snapped open and for a long moment, nothing followed. Then came the rustle of underbrush, circling the hut. I held my breath, straining to hear, heart thumping so loud I swore it would wake James. A low creak groaned against the outer wall, like something brushing past the logs. I lay still in my bed, still as a corpse. Eyes glued on the window on the other side of the hut.

Then slowly, impossibly, a pale face appeared at the glass.

It wasn’t sudden—it eased into view, like someone pressing forward out of the shadows. The skin was chalk white, almost glowing against the black of the forest behind it. No visible hair, but large sunken eyes stared into the shelter.

It didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

It looked unreal, like something pasted onto the night itself. My body screamed to wake James, to shout, to run, but all I could do was stare. Then, slowly, the face drifted away from the window.

And did something worse.

The door rattled. Someone—*something*—was trying to get in.

That broke me. I tore free of the sleeping bag, hatchet in one hand, flashlight in the other. My voice cracked the silence: “James! Wake up!”

James jolted upright with a snort, confused, as I charged the door like a madman. I wrenched the lock free and threw it open, the beam of my flashlight cutting through the dark. James stumbled up beside me, still wearing nothing but his boxers, wielding the fire poker in one hand, lantern in the other, looking like a half-asleep caveman. “Jesus, man,” he muttered, rubbing his face. “What the *fuck* are you doing?”

“The door,” I hissed, pointing at it with the hatchet. “Someone tried to open the door. I saw—” My words faltered, my chest tightening. How could I even explain what that face looked like? It didn’t feel human.

James squinted into the trees, holding up the lantern in front of him, unimpressed. “I don’t see shit. Probably a raccoon or something.”

I didn’t answer. My grip on the flashlight trembled, the circle of light jittering across the treeline.

Then, faint—so faint I almost thought I imagined it—came the sound of *something* retreating deeper into the woods. Not the four-legged scramble of an animal. Two feet, crunching over leaves.

I didn’t sleep much the rest of the night. Every crack, every creak, every branch scratching against the hut’s walls set my nerves on edge. My eyes remained glued to the window, waiting for the visitor to return.

“Damn it!” I woke with a start. Beams of morning light were bleeding in through the windows. James sat on his bed, satellite phone in hand, frown etched across his face.

“Come on, you piece of shit, work!” he muttered, glancing in my direction.

“Oh… morning,” he added distractedly, not noticing my tension. “Sleep okay?”

I tried, and failed, to shake the last vestiges of sleep from my head. “Not really,” I admitted, rubbing my eyes.

I nodded toward the satellite phone. “Still not working, huh?”

“Nope. Might need to be put more in the oatmeal,” he muttered, glancing up at me with a hard look. “We… going to talk about last night?”

Heat rose to my face. Embarrassment hit hard, but I knew I couldn’t let it slide. If I stayed quiet, I’d look like a lunatic.

“Look, man,” I said with a heavy sigh, running a hand through my hair, something I did when stressed, “I’m not crazy. I saw something.”

James stared at me skeptically, eyes locked on mine, searching for any sign that this was some elaborate prank at his expense. After a long beat, he nodded. “Okay… so what was it you saw?”

I hesitated; grateful he was at least listening. “Not exactly sure,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “But it was… skinny. Pale.”

James cracked a wicked grin. “Very original.”

“I’m serious, dude,” I snapped, irritation starting to flare.

James wiggled his fingers at me and pulled a ridiculous face. “It was Slenderman, huh?”

I threw my hands in the air. “I know how crazy it sounds—I’m not making this shit up.”

James put a finger to his ear, mimicking a microphone, and in a mock-reporter voice said, “This just in: local hikers found fucked to death by cliché monster.”

I groaned, running a hand over my face. “You *do* realize this isn’t funny, right?”

James shrugged and leaned back against the wall, still smirking

I just roll my eyes, “whatever dude, lets just get going” and began gathering up my belongings.

The next couple of kilometers were slow and exhausting. Not only was I sleep-deprived, but every few feet I found myself glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that pale figure lurking behind the trees. Each time, there was nothing—just the swaying of branches and the occasional rustle of unseen wildlife.

By the time the sun was beginning to tilt toward the horizon, around 5 p.m., we were still eight or nine kilometers shy of the next hut. My muscles ached, my pack felt heavier than ever, I really didn’t want to sleep outside after last nights encounter.

 Unfortunately, it looked like we didn’t have a choice. We set up camp and made do with a simple dinner of protein bars and ketchup chips. Later, we played cards under the weak glow of the lantern. James gloated with every win, his laughter echoing faintly in the stillness, but my mind was elsewhere.

As the shadows stretched long and thick around our small campsite, a creeping unease settled over me. The forest, which had seemed quiet and familiar all day, now felt alive with unseen eyes. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, sent a shiver crawling up my spine. I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

“Are you going to be okay?” James asked, genuine.

“Yeah… yeah, I think so,” I replied, though the tremor in my voice betrayed my unease.

“Well… I’m hitting the hay. If you get eaten alive by this monster, try not to scream too loud—I don’t want my beauty sleep interrupted,” he joked, lightly jabbing me in the arm.

I forced a weak smile, but my eyes drifted to the dark forest surrounding us. The shadows seemed alive, the trees shifting just enough to suggest movement. It felt like the eyes were everywhere, watching my every move, waiting for a moment of weakness to strike. My guard felt impossibly thin, and the night stretched out ahead like a living thing. I slipped into my sleeping bag, trying to convince myself I was just being paranoid. The forest outside seemed still, but every so often a branch would crack, a leaf would scrape against another, and my pulse would spike. James’ even breathing soon reminded me that he had already dozed off. I envied him, or at least the illusion of peace he seemed to have. I tried to close my eyes, to block out the feeling of eyes pressing in from the darkness.

A few sleepless hours later, the urge to piss became impossible to ignore. I tried to push it down, telling myself to wait, not wanting to step outside into the dark, watching woods. But it was a losing battle.

I muttered a curse under my breath and quietly unzipped my tent flap. Heart thudding, I peeked out, sweeping the flashlight beam across the forest. Shadows stretched and twisted, but nothing moved.

The waning gibbous moon sagged in the sky like a bruised eye, its swollen face leaking pale light across the forest. The glow wasn’t comforting—it was sickly, strained, as though the moon itself were wasting away. Shadows stretched long and crooked under its watch, twisting the trees into warped silhouettes. Every patch of silver light felt like exposure, like being dragged under its gaze, while the darkness between seemed to crawl closer, eager to swallow what the moon abandoned.

Slowly, I stepped out of the safety of my tent, every nerve on edge, and moved to relieve myself, ears straining for the slightest sound. The forest felt impossibly still, yet every instinct screamed that I wasn’t truly alone. After I finished, I turned to head back to my tent—and froze. The beam of my flashlight caught it, partially hidden behind a tree. Its bald head tilted slightly, pale and wide eyed, staring straight at me.

“Fuck!” I shouted, the flashlight shaking in my hands. My grip tightened around the hatchet, every muscle coiled, ready to charge if it stepped closer. The forest seemed to hold its breath, the usual night sounds fading into an unnatural silence.

I could feel my pulse hammering in my ears, each heartbeat a deafening drum. The figure didn’t move—just watched, impossibly still, as if assessing whether I was a threat.

Then, a bony hand emerged from behind the tree, followed by a weak, quivering voice: “Please… I’m lost.”

If I hadn’t just gone, I probably would have soiled myself right then.

By now, James was emerging from his tent, lantern in hand, rubbing sleep from his eyes. His gaze fell on the figure, and he staggered back in terror. “Fucking hell!” he screamed. “What the fuck is that?”

“Please don’t hurt me,” the creature said, its voice fragile. “I haven’t seen another person in so long… please. I mean you no harm.”

My pulse still racing, I forced myself to take a step forward. Summoning every ounce of courage, I shouted, “Come out where we can see you!”

Ever so slowly, it emerged from behind the tree, pale features fully revealed, its movements deliberate and cautious. It looked like a walking skeleton, skin stretched taut over bone, caked in dirt and mud. Its body was completely hairless—no hair on its head, face, or body, not even eyebrows. like Cormac McCarthy’s infamous character, the Judge, if he was liberated from Auschwitz.

I noticed, uncomfortably, that it had no clothes, leaving its thin, frail form fully exposed. The sight made my stomach churn, but I forced myself to focus, trying to understand whether it truly meant any harm. “Who… who are you?” I asked, voice steadier than I felt.

It gestured to itself, long, bony fingers curling awkwardly, and rasped. “My name… is David Varg,”",2,1758594826.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

so she does, and basically my sister's mad because she does everything for me and i ""can't sacrifice my time to do the same thing in return"". 

for extra context, my sister for some reason doesn't want to do things on her own, it's always been like this since i was younger. each time she went to the store i HAD to go with her or else she was going to be upset with me. I had hoped this would all dissolve, but it didn't. there was this time where she wanted to go to a fashion show, i declined as i'm not into that. she keeps insisting and she says ""i already bought us tickets"". the day of the event, i'm clearly unhappy to be there and she says, ""well you could've just said no, i would've went by myself."" 

this has been an ongoing issue, and i've always feared of upsetting her or giving pushback because it 100% always results in her getting angry and pulling away. it's literally just us two and we have nobody else to depend on.

so when i confronted her about all the things she's done for me, she brings up the times where she had to drive me places (all places in which she volunteered on driving to). there was this time where she suggested for us to go painting at the library, and i asked her multiple times, ""are you sure you want to?"" to which she responded ""yeah i like painting!""

we even had to reschedule the painting event and i insisted we really didn't need to go, but she wanted to. even after the painting event she suggested for us to buy some to continue it.

now today, she apparently didn't even want to go painting and only did it for me.

she held the fact over my head that she pays for the bills, subscriptions, and my wisdom tooth surgery, which are all things i have asked on multiple occassions to pay for, and called me selfish for not bothering to go out with her, despite us being around each other 24/7.

and when i brought up how she gives the cold shoulder when she's mad at me? denied it completely. said it was me who does it, despite me having to say ""hi"" to her every time i see her, despite me letting her know when i'm leaving the house, despite me literally going to her room every single night to say goodnight and that i love her.

she also had an noncancerous fibroid surgery, which she decided to cancel because she ""has no support system"". i don't know why she's risking her own health over something like this.

she also called me incompetent and pretty much implied i'm holding her down she can't wait to go",15,1758594608.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.74,False

I'd rather just meet up quickly to see if we actually vibe and are attracted to each other. Even with people that I am closer with, I prefer to text for logistics only. But for the sake of landing a potential date, I'll play the game for a little bit and ask my matches if they're free for coffee or an activity after a few messages of banter on the app, but it usually leads to them ghosting after asking. My guess is from the woman's perspective, they have a lot of interested guys messaging and giving them attention so there is probably some inertia to meeting up.

I'm so incredibly excited to have finally gotten an ADHD diagnosis but I'm honestly scared to start a stimulant med.

Also a question about TEVA.... i'm worried that it wont be the same as name brand vyvanse and I messed up by accepting it from the pharmacy. I don't want to take it and experience bad results and feel like all vyvanse is that way, especially if the name brand is better. Does anyone have any experience with TEVA vs Name Brand????

I drink a nespresso latte every morning, not for the caffeine but simply because I really enjoy the taste of coffee and it's part of my routine now. Do you think this is something I need to give up, or would it be okay to keep having only 1 cup with the meds? I guess I won't know how my heart reacts to it until I do it, but I'm nervous for that aspect. I also really don't love the decaf nespresso pods so trying to figure out if I can tolerate the both is great before I waste money.

I'm also a commuter student at uni right now which means I leave the house at 6:30am. Because of this it's so hard to eat breakfast most mornings. I know eating breakfast and having protein is so crucial outside of taking the med, but so important with taking it. Does anyone have meal tips or ways that I can still take my meds in the morning but not need to wake up at 5:30 just to make a breakfast??

I will honestly take any and all tips that have helped you with taking your meds, what to avoid, etc.

About 90 % of startups fail within five years.  
A leading cause is unclear problem definition.  
If a prospect can’t explain the problem in 30 seconds, they won’t pay for the solution.

I can work from home, a coffee shop, a friend's house, in the passenger seat while my partner drives us out of town for the weekend, etc. The perks are amazing.

But I struggle to focus. I postpone projects until they're due. I only work on the most pressing issues. I don't take breaks to stretch or go for a walk, instead I get distracted on my phone. I feel like I'm constantly behind because I can't buckle down and focus for a few hours. 

My ask: How do you focus sitting at a desk? How do you maintain the motivation to do a task, take a brain break, and then work on something else? 

Background: I've never worked in an office. My previous job was in high volume, fast paced restaurants. I have a great home office set up (desk, two monitors, lots of plants). 

I'm open to ideas! I work for a great company and my boss is 10/10. I want to improve and don't want to lose my job in the process. Thanks!
