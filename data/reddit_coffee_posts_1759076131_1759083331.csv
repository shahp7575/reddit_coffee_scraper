1nsv8v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LMIASCAMS/comments/1nsv8v2/i_dont_understand_how_this_is_still_happening/,I don't understand how this is still happening....,"I mean, everybody knows by now the scam. Countless jobs for coffee / hamburger engineers (surely we can't just hire Canadians at minimum wage to do these jobs... we need to fly people from across the ocean to flip my burgers and poor my coffee.... surely my teenage sons are incapable of this feat, they are unemployable.... they haven't gotten their hamburger engineering degrees yet?).... its insane. Everybody knows the scam by now. 36 bucks an hour job to flip burgers, give me a break....

Its so obvious, I just don't understand how this could still be happening.  Everybody is pissed. Everybody is complaining about it to the government. Please help me understand why these permits are still being issued? This had to be on purpose. Surely the government can't be so freaking stupid that they happily rubber stamp these applications? Like the people who approve these applications, how stupid can they be? A thousand applications cross their desks every week,  and it really seems like they're all approved. The people approving these, are they really reading the applications from Tim Horton's who are pretending to hire a TFW to be a food managers for 36 bucks an hour, claiming they couldn't find ANYBODY who wants a 36 dollar an hour job that lives here... and thinking to themselves ""This poor franchise. They just want to hire some local Canadians to do the job, but there simply aren't any Canadians who are willing to do the job. How can this poor franchise owner survive if they dont fly somebody in from India ASAP to fill this position? "". HOW DUMB CAN THEY BE? 

It really feels like the government is in on it on purpose, or the people approving the applications are in on it or something.

Somebody PLEASE make it make sense to me. If I am misunderstanding something please correct me.",1,1759083033.0,LMIASCAMS,0,1.0,False

And don‚Äôt judge me pleaseee. I‚Äôm F20 and he‚Äôs 28 I like older guys pero siya yung nakaka hype ko and kasabayan ko sa humor. 

Context : Long story short po  we met here sa reddit and we are now a fubu, nung una okay naman pagkikita namin and ilan pang meet ups.He‚Äôs cute, gentle and jolly basta ang comforting niya kausap kaya eto ako pag magkikita kami always bonggang preparation sa sarili and super excited kaso ito kase ang negative here, he‚Äôs always BUSY medyo gets ko naman since he has work and have his own life pero ni ‚Äòhi‚Äô sa loob ng dalawang araw walang natatanggap :/. We do have plans as well na hindi natutuloy na twice nangyari na ayos na ayos ka na tapos dun icacancel and he‚Äôs ‚Äúlulubog-lilitaw‚Äù kind of person (and napansin ko kase na ACTIVE LANG siya makipag usap pag planong meet up namin means we are doing kerengkengchi). Our recent meet up din ako ang gumastos kase sinabi niya na it almost a month wala silang salary which I understand pero na off parin ako syempre hindi ako naging aware before we meet kase sana manlang na ready ako kahit papaano, buti nalang may pera ako nun and WORST no thank you before we part ways after our dinner and coffee date just a cute hug ( I appreciate it but not satisfied bruh). 


Guys he‚Äôs gentle and responsible base sa mga kwento niya about being breadwinner sa family niya and pinapautang ako nun before nung nagigipit ako butttt wala siyang time makipag usap sakin unless mag plan kami another meet up of us. Like oo fubu lang kami and I‚Äôm asking for more huhu. 

I already asked him nung nag Baguio kami bakit hindi pa siya mag asawa since obvious naman na okay na siya sa life niya, tapos sagot niya ‚Äúayaw mo pa eh‚Äù LIKEE??? SIGN BA YUNN?? I DUNNOO ANG GULOO

SO ANO BA GAGAWIN DITO? AAMIN BA OR MOVE FORWARD AND GHOST HIM NA PARANG NOTHING HAPPENED? I‚Äôm NBSB kaya I dunnoo please don‚Äôt judge me I don‚Äôt like commitment pero pagdating sa kaniya natamaan talaga ata ako. I‚Äôm being with my true self and more vocal when I‚Äôm with him.",1,1759082928.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

1nsv6rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChemistry/comments/1nsv6rb/why_does_a_descaling_product_contain_both_an_acid/,Why does a descaling product contain both an acid and a base?,"So I was trying to buy some Sulfamic acid for an experiment and found a descaling product for coffee machines in the supermarket which contained >90% Sulfamic Acid. 

However I was surprised to find that it also contained <10% Sodium Carbonate. 
Why could this be? Is it to reduce the strength of the Sulfamic acid or does the resulting sodium sulfamate have a use for descaling?

Finally is there a way to isolate sulfamic acid from this product or is it all converted into sodium sulfamate when dissolved in water?",1,1759082897.0,AskChemistry,0,1.0,False

A can of MH chicken ala king baby...whooooo!!!!! Shout-out to u/SirG2020 and u/Amelieee1 for the British SMR packs. I've purchased from SirG2020 several times and highly recommend him. He's located on the West Coast and has loads of foreign rations for the folks who don't want to deal with customs and shipping. Amelieee1 also sells and ships out of the UK. One day I'll purchase a case from her. Maybe for my birthday next year. ,3,1759082853.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1nsv601,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nsv601/am_i_overreacting_coworker_uses_grief_as_an/,"Am I Overreacting? Coworker Uses Grief as an Excuse While Drinking, Lying, and Ditching Work-Are We Heartless for Being Done???","My coworkers and I are struggling with whether we‚Äôre overreacting and if we are the assholes or not. There are five of us who work closely at a very large medical practice, We‚Äôve all been at the practice for years, ages ranging from mid-20s to 60, and we‚Äôve always been a close knit team that works directly with the doctors the doctors cannot do procedures without us we physically sit next to them and assist them so it‚Äôs important for us to show up. One of our coworkers, who‚Äôs in her 30s and who I used to consider my best friend, has made the workplace toxic in recent months, manipulative, and constantly leaves us all short staffed. 

She started taking medications for things she isn‚Äôt actually diagnosed for, taking things like Adderall, xanax, ambien, while also drinking heavily, and she often runs out of her prescriptions very early. She calls out for days if not a week at a time, leaves early, or takes off for reasons that don‚Äôt add up like taking a Monday off because of a hangover, taking a week off cause she fell and hurt her foot over the weekend when I was actually with her and know she didn‚Äôt, lying about her child‚Äôs school schedule, or claiming mental health days because she ran out of pills. She‚Äôs also faked doctor‚Äôs appointments and sickness, then spent her days shopping, drinking, or hanging out. It‚Äôs important to know we know this because we have her location plus she also was sending us snapchats of what she was doing. Even when she does show up recently she refuses to take patients, looks hungover, lashes out at us for no reason, and acts openly annoyed in front of patients.

About a month ago, her grandmother passed away. She took a full week off, which at first we all understood. But during that time she was out shopping, sending us cooking videos, organizing her house, meeting coworkers for coffee, friends for lunch and drinking.. we were all confused why she couldn‚Äôt show up to work but could do all that. Then, after coming back, she barely worked‚Äîcalling out for ‚Äúcoughing and sneezing‚Äù but still going shopping and cooking, taking off for ‚Äúfamily issues‚Äù but spending the day at the bar, or coming in visibly hungover and having to be driven home by our other coworker while still on the clock.. taking from the business at this point. 

The last straw for me was when she left me completely short-staffed on Friday. Normally only two of us work Fridays, and another coworker had scheduled her wedding day off months in advance. This coworker had agreed to cover, but then just decided not to show up and asked our new front desk girl to move patients around, this I have a problem with because that‚Äôs not right to inconvenience patients. Her excuse for doing all this was ‚ÄúI need to catch up on sleep‚Äù mind you we only work until 1 on Fridays. She did all this without asking me if I was okay being alone. I confronted her by text, and we argued. I told her I was tired of being left short-staffed and that this has been going on for months not just because of the death of her grandmother and she‚Äôs really using her death to be manipulative to us all and I find that disgusting. It‚Äôs also not the first time three years ago she ghosted all of us for an entire year, saying she needed a mental health break, but instead of getting help she just drank the whole time.

I went to the head doctor about it the next day. He told me I wasn‚Äôt the first to bring it up and he has looked back at her time clock and she has missed numerous days or left early since 2025 started, he even asked me what I thought should be done. I told him I didn‚Äôt want her fired or to quit, I just want someone to tell her to show up and be present. His response was basically that it sounds like she‚Äôs going to lose her job. Later that day he and the other doctors decided to give her a week off to ‚Äúget it together,‚Äù this visibly upset me because she had already been out multiple weeks recently and also is the same person who got a year long mental health break after ghosting us and was brought back with a raise I just wanted someone to tell her she needs to come to work. It feels like we‚Äôre constantly being taken advantage of while she gets chance after chance and we have to pick up the slack. It‚Äôs important to know we have fired people in the past for much less than what she has done. 

She didn‚Äôt take the text they sent her well and responded to the doctor saying she quits. She texted our group calling us heartless and fake, told us to go f*** ourselves, and said she hopes we never experience what she‚Äôs going through. But all of us have gone through grief, illness, and personal struggles many just as bad if not worse than hers‚Äîand we still showed up and did our jobs. I feel awful because I really did see her as a best friend and never wanted it to come to this. I just wanted her to be reliable. But the truth is, healthcare is not the kind of job where you can repeatedly disappear, lie, or lash out. If you can‚Äôt put your issues aside enough to show up for patients and your team, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be in a public-facing role.

So now I‚Äôm wondering if my coworkers and I are being too harsh, or if we‚Äôre just finally done putting up with something that‚Äôs been toxic for months. I feel awful this happened to her while she‚Äôs dealing with the death of her grandmother but it‚Äôs hard to look past everything when this has been going on for so long, it just finally came to a head. I want her to get the help she needs and we all believe she needs therapy and rehab. 
Would you say we overreacted?? Are we the assholes ??? I feel hurt because I have lost a best friend in all this as well.. 
part of me wants to reach out to her and apologize but part of me also feels like I‚Äôm not in the wrong and I‚Äôm justified for how I feel..

After seeing the positive I grabbed my keys and ran to Target to get a box of FRER tests. It was about 45 minutes later when I took it. The first FRER picture was taken at 1 minute, LOL.

I just needed to see more confirmation, so about an hour and a half later, I took a digital test. Got a ‚ÄòYes+‚Äô and still have yet to fully process all of this üòÇ.

A few months ago, a coworker started to show special interest in me. He makes remarkes that he is checking the scedule to see when he's working with me. He brings me coffee and sweets. Says he thinks I'm perfect and overall just giving me a vibe that he has a crush on me. 

Well, I'm married with kids and so is he. He is funny, kind and smart but also, because of his appearence, he reminds me of my uncle, who SA'd me as a teenager. He's done nothing wrong and rationally I know he is not a bad person. But I'm so confused about my feelings. 
I don't think I like him in that way. I love my husband very much. But if he crosses a boundry I'm not sure if I can set boundries. 

I notice I'm anxious about the situation. I have trouble eating. Lost 3 kilo's by now. He didn't do anything wrong. It is not fair to project the wrong doings of my uncle on to him. I don't want trouble at work, I just want to work in peace. 

I cant tell my husband. He will not understand and will be prone to action and I dont want drama.

4 days ago I met a guy on a party I was very attracted to, he's a friend of a friend. We talked a lot, and our mutual friend went home and we even spent more time partying together after that. He seemed genuinely excited I was joining him and not going home yet with my friend. 

After a bit I went home though, there wasn't a moment to make a move, but I asked his contant. The next morning I texted if he wanted to have a coffee together if he's still in town, and he said he's still at his friends house, and I can come over to have coffee there. 

Well so I did, met some new people and spent the afternoon exchanging music and just hanging around, I liked it!

I went home all happy, but now what. I think it's pushy to propose again, I also think it's probably clear I am curious/interested,  so I thought I'd wait a bit and see if he wants to hang out again aswell. 

It's only been 4 days but I'm starting to feel a bit unhinged waiting for any news or text. It's totally normal it's not even been a week but I can't properly focus on other stuff cause I'm now in this anticipation mode. And there's still the chance he won't reach out at all actually, aaah, I'm so impatient and I don't like to be so infatuated with a stranger - I know it's based on fantasy, but that usually is the best ingredient for infatuation.

His birthdays in December and then obviously there's christmas so I need lots of ideas. He's also the type that if he does like something, he goes out and buys everything for it and it's all the best of the best. So it makes gift ideas tough.

It'll probably be easier for me to list what he **doesn't like/wouldn't do:**  
Doesn't drink.  
Doesn't play many video games - he already has his set few games he likes and that's it.  
Doesn't read, or do anything crafty.  
Doesn't like collecting things or clutter anymore - so even things like funko pops are a no go.  
He Isn't into making his own coffees at home(and would forget about a giftcard)  
He's not big into like... Fancy bbq/smoking/etc stuff. Not a big cook.  
He's type 2 diabetic so candy/chocolate/food is tough.  
He used to really like jordan sneakers, that's all he asked for but he'd never ever wear them and has now said he doesn't want anymore and is selling his current ones.  
He has too much cologne, he's always saying he's giving bottles away.  
Electronics? Already has the newest iphone, ps5, headset, controllers, nice laptop, etc.  
He's also not into personalized things... or experiences.

Like I'm trying to think of stuff he does and he... doesn't seem to do much. He likes to fish but I think that goes back to he already has the best/most expensive stuff for that idk. He also likes collecting gold but that's also out of my budget I think.... He's also in all the gold buy and sell raffle fb groups so I couldn't even try to win a raffle for some for him...

And if I ask him what he wants, he'll say he doesn't know or will let me know after he thinks and he never does lol  
I'm reallyyyy struggling.

1nsut1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nsut1e/can_method_allpurpose_cleaner_handle_tough_messes/,Can Method All-Purpose Cleaner Handle Tough Messes Effectively Review of SC Johnson LSB,"Testing cleaning products daily has turned into a habit for me, and I recently had the chance to try out SC Johnson LSB's thomaswi, also known as the Method All-Purpose Cleaner, Pink Grapefruit. This 28-ounce spray bottle has piqued my interest because of its plant-based, biodegradable formula and versatility with surfaces like counters, tiles, stones, and even glass. While I'm typically skeptical about products boasting environmentally friendly credentials, I dove in to see how well this cleaner could tackle grease, grime, and everyday messes.

**Design and Packaging**  
The bottle design is straightforward but effective. It fits comfortably in my hand, which makes spraying manageable for longer cleaning sessions. The nozzle, though simple, doesn't clog or misfire, something that's been an issue with other cleaners I've used before. Bonus points for the bottle being crafted from 100% recycled plastic (minus the nozzle). The commitment to sustainability is clear from the packaging itself, which lends it a modern and thoughtful vibe.

**Ease of Use**  
Applying the product is remarkably simple. A couple of sprays cover sufficient area, so there‚Äôs no need to drown your surfaces in cleaning solution. What's more, the scent of pink grapefruit fills the room almost instantly. It's like having a refreshing blast of citrusy aroma while tackling household cleaning. Unlike many cleaners that leave behind a strange chemical smell, this one actually makes cleaning more enjoyable. I used it on the kitchen counter, wooden dining table, and even a glass coffee table ‚Äî no streaks and no sticky residue left behind.

**Upsides**  
Testing this cleaner every day, I uncovered several strengths:  

- Biodegradable, plant-based formula that‚Äôs safe for everyday use.  
- Bottle made with 100% recycled plastic, which appeals to my eco-conscious side.  
- Multi-surface cleaning capability, versatile enough for counters, wood, tiles, and glass.
  
[Check SC Johnson LSB thomaswi price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0013fmnce/)

**Performance**  
This product doesn't just promise to tackle grease and grime; it delivers with impressive efficiency. I tried it on an old coffee stain that had seeped into our stone countertop and was genuinely surprised at how easily it lifted the stain without much elbow grease on my part. Of course, not every battle was a complete victory ‚Äî a particularly stubborn grease buildup on the stove needed a couple of applications before it completely disappeared. Still, its cleaning power was robust in most scenarios.

**Negatives**  
Even great products have a few hurdles:  

- Not suitable for all types of surfaces ‚Äî be careful with unfinished wood or delicate stone.  
- Scent, while pleasant for me, might feel overpowering to those sensitive to strong fragrances.  
- Fixed nozzle design limits flexibility for fine spray adjustments.

**Challengers**  
Considering its price range and performance, this cleaner does have competitors in the marketplace, such as Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day and Seventh Generation‚Äôs All-Purpose Cleaner. Compared directly, the SC Johnson product edges them out with its biodegradable formula and cheerful grapefruit scent, but the others might be better choices for those with more delicate surfaces or fragrance sensitivities. Seventh Generation, for instance, leans towards a milder-unscented approach, while Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs highlights lavish floral scents, which appeal to different kinds of users.

**Value Proposition**  
For what this cleaner delivers, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth your money, especially for eco-conscious households. The fusion of performance, plant-based ingredients, and scent makes it a great option for someone like me, who needs reliable and versatile cleaners every day. No, it‚Äôs not perfect, and you‚Äôll need something stronger for industrial-level grime, but for the average household, it‚Äôs a worthy investment.

1nsusv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Beautiful-Warning719/comments/1nsusv5/chapter_14_the_calm/,CHAPTER 14: The Calm,"  
***POV: Sophie***

Three days passed.

The joint statement was released‚Äîa bland, three-paragraph piece of legal prose that successfully bored the media into moving on. The story was now framed as a ""cybercrime incident,"" and the world, ever hungry for new drama, had largely turned its attention elsewhere.

The gallery, however, was thriving.¬†***""The Unvarnished Truth""***¬†had become a critical and commercial success. The attempted sabotage had, perversely, lent the exhibition an air of notoriety that drew larger crowds. They came for the story, but they stayed for the art. I could feel it in the quiet, respectful atmosphere that now filled the rooms.

I was in my office, reviewing staggering sales figures with Nella, when a familiar name caught my eye on the client list.

*""Lucas bought a piece?""*¬†I asked, a smile touching my lips for the first time in days. He'd chosen the small, fiery abstract from Aiden's box‚Äîthe one from the night I'd first said I loved him.

Nella grinned.¬†*""He said it was about time he invested in 'genius' instead of just protecting it.""*

The warmth of the moment was interrupted by a soft knock on the open doorframe.

We both looked up.

Aiden stood there, looking impossibly out of place amidst the organized chaos of my success. He held a simple cardboard tray with two coffee cups.

*""Truce?""*¬†he asked, his voice tentative.

Nella glanced at me, and at my slight nod, she gathered her papers.¬†*""I'll, uh, go check on the install for the new lighting in the main hall.""*¬†She slipped out, giving Aiden a wide berth.

He stepped fully into the office, setting the tray on the edge of my desk.¬†*""I come bearing peace offerings. Black, two sugars. The way you used to take it.""*

*""I still do,""*¬†I said, my guard instinctively rising.¬†*""What are you doing here, Aiden?""*

*""Not causing trouble,""*¬†he said, raising his hands in a gesture of surrender. He looked tired, but the desperate edge was gone.¬†*""I was in the neighborhood. I heard the show is a smash. I... I wanted to say congratulations. Honestly.""*

I studied him. This wasn't the grand gesture of the press conference or the desperate defense of the opening night. This was quiet. Normal. And somehow, more disarming.

*""Thank you,""*¬†I said cautiously, accepting the coffee. The warmth seeped into my hands.¬†*""The statement worked.""*

*""It was your strategy. It was brilliant.""*¬†He didn't try to move closer. He just stood there, a respectful distance away, sipping his own coffee.¬†*""I also came to give you an update. The investigation into the leak is ongoing. It's slow. But it's moving.""*

I nodded.¬†*""Okay.""*

An awkward silence fell. It was filled with the ghosts of every other conversation we'd ever had in this city‚Äîfull of love, then full of pain. Now, it was just... quiet.

*""I should let you get back to work,""*¬†he said finally, turning to leave.

*""Aiden.""*

He stopped.

*""The coffee,""*¬†I said.¬†*""Thank you.""*

A small, genuine smile, the first I'd seen from him in years, touched his lips. It transformed his face, erasing the years of hardness.¬†*""You're welcome, Sophie.""*

And then he was gone.

I looked down at the coffee cup. It was just a coffee. But it felt like the first truly honest thing he'd given me since he'd walked back into my life.

***POV: Aiden***

Walking away from her office was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. I wanted to stay. To bask in the competence she radiated. To talk about anything‚Äîthe weather, the new artist she was thinking of showcasing, the damn coffee.

But I'd made a promise to myself. No pressure. No expectations. Just presence. If she allowed it.

My phone buzzed as I hit the sidewalk. It was an unknown number, but the area code was familiar. Mark, an old college friend who now worked in private security.

*""Aiden. That trace you wanted on the Switzerland VPN lead. We hit a wall. A big, expensive, professionally built wall. Whoever did this is very, very good. But we found a pressure point. The hack was commissioned through a third-party service. A middleman. And middlemen love to talk when the heat is on.""*

*""Can you get a name?""*¬†I asked, my pulse quickening.

*""Working on it. It'll cost you.""*

*""Name your price.""*

*""Already did. You'll get the invoice. Just... watch your back, Kingsley. The level of expertise here? This isn't a jealous ex. This is corporate espionage-level shit. She's playing for keeps.""*

The call ended. I stood on the busy street, the sun feeling suddenly cold. He was right. The therapy notes were a deeply personal attack, but the method was cold, professional, and expensive. This was beyond Alessia's usual venom. She had help. Or she was someone's weapon.

The flicker of peace I'd felt in Sophie's office vanished, replaced by a cold, sharp dread. The calm was an illusion. The storm was just gathering its strength.

***POV: Alessia***

I watched from the tinted window of the hired car as Aiden emerged from the gallery. He looked... lighter. Hopeful. The fool actually thought he could have a quiet coffee with her and pretend the past didn't exist.

My phone vibrated with a message from my contact.

**Asset:**¬†*The trace was advanced. They're getting close to the middleman. It's time to activate phase two. The narrative is ready.*

I typed back a single word.

***Alessia:***¬†*Proceed.*

I leaned back against the leather seats. Aiden thought he was protecting her from me. He had no idea that the real danger was the seed of doubt I was about to plant in his own mind. A doubt that would make him question every moment of their reconciliation, every quiet coffee, every grateful smile.

Let him have his calm.

I was about to shatter it with a truth he would never be able to unsee. Or rather, a lie he would desperately want to believe.

Here's Why Metro Market Deli is a Clinton Hill Must-Visit.,"Let's talk delis. In Brooklyn, they're on every corner. But finding one that truly elevates the experience from the sandwich in your hand to the coffee in your cup is a different story.

That‚Äôs the gap we set out to fill at¬†**Metro Market Deli**¬†in¬†**Clinton Hill**. We‚Äôre not just a¬†**deli**¬†and grocery store; we‚Äôre a destination for those who appreciate quality, whether it's for lunch or their morning ritual.

And it starts with a detail most delis overlook: The Coffee.

# ‚òï The Coffee Difference: Why We Serve Stumptown

Let's be honest, most deli coffee is an afterthought. We decided to change that.

We are the only¬†**deli and grocery store**¬†in the area that proudly serves¬†**Stumptown Coffee Roasters**. This isn't just a ""premium"" label; it's a commitment to serving you the same ethically sourced, expertly roasted coffee you'd find in a dedicated caf√©. We believe your morning pick-me-up shouldn't be a compromise between convenience and quality. You can grab a perfectly crafted cup with your breakfast sandwich and know you're getting the¬†**best coffee**¬†we can possibly offer‚Äînever something cheap or unsustainable.

# üèÜ Our Deli Philosophy: Quality You Can Taste

This same standard applies to everything behind our counter. A great sandwich is built on a foundation of impeccable ingredients.

* **Premium Boar‚Äôs Head Meats & Cheeses:**¬†This is our baseline. We slice all our¬†**Boar‚Äôs Head**¬†turkey, ham, roast beef, and corned beef fresh for every single sandwich. No pre-packaged, dry cuts here.
* **Fresh-Baked Bread Daily:**¬†A sandwich is only as good as its foundation. We get our hero rolls, wraps, and bread delivered daily for that perfect texture.
* **The Classics, Done Right:**¬†From a stacked¬†**Pastrami on Rye**¬†to a classic¬†**Italian Hero**, we focus on perfecting the sandwiches you love. We also love crafting custom orders‚Äîjust tell us what you‚Äôre craving.

# üìç More Than a Brooklyn Deli Counter

While our¬†**Stumptown coffee**¬†and sandwiches are the headliners, we‚Äôve built¬†**Metro Market Deli**¬†to be your one-stop shop in¬†**Clinton Hill**.

* **Your Morning Routine:**¬†Grab a¬†**Stumptown cold brew**¬†and a hot breakfast sandwich. It‚Äôs the ultimate fast, high-quality start to your day.
* **Essential Groceries:**¬†We stock a solid selection of groceries, fresh produce, snacks, and cold drinks. Think of us for those last-minute dinner ingredients or late-night snack runs.
* **Local Catering for Brooklyn Offices & Parties:**¬†We provide¬†**catering**¬†for¬†**office meetings**¬†and¬†**parties**¬†throughout Brooklyn. Our sandwich platters and hero trays are a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.

# ü§î Why Choose Us? The Real Differentiators

In a city full of options, here‚Äôs what sets our¬†**deli**¬†apart:

1. **Caf√©-Grade Coffee:**¬†We are the only deli pairing¬†**Stumptown Coffee**¬†with¬†**Boar's Head sandwiches**. It‚Äôs a game-changer for your morning or afternoon break.
2. **Consistent Quality:**¬†We never swap out our brands. You get the same high-quality meat and coffee every single time.
3. **Community Focus:**¬†We‚Äôre a local business, not a faceless chain. We love being part of the¬†**Clinton Hill**¬†community.

# üôã Your Turn! Let's Talk Deli & Coffee

I could go on, but I‚Äôm more interested in what you think.

* **For those who have been in:**¬†Did you try the¬†**Stumptown**? What‚Äôs your usual sandwich order?
* **For everyone:**¬†What‚Äôs the one thing that would make you choose one deli over all the others? Is it the coffee, a specific ingredient, or something else?

We‚Äôre always looking to improve and serve our neighborhood better. Your feedback is invaluable.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method

\--------  ------------  --------------------------------

Dough

  1                cup  milk

1/2           cup  sugar

  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt

  2          envelopes  active dry yeast

  1           teaspoon  sugar

  1                cup  warm water -- very warm

  2              large  eggs

  6               cups  sifted all purpose flour

1/4           cup  melted butter

Filling

1/3           cup  melted butter

3/4           cup  sugar

  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon

Frosting

  3        tablespoons  butter

  2               cups  powdered sugar

  2        tablespoons  hot coffee

1/2      teaspoon  maple flavoring



Dough: Heat milk, sugar and salt in a small saucepan until sugar melts

and small bubbles appear around edge of pan. Cool to lukewarm.



Dissolve yeast in 1 teaspoon sugar in very warm water in a large bowl.

(Very warm water should feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist).

Stir until well-blended and allow to stand 10 minutes, or until

bubbles begin to form.



Beat eggs into yeast mixture; stir in cooled milk mixture. Beat in

flour, a little at a time, until dough becomes elastic; beat in melted

butter. Work in enough of the remaining flour to make a kneadable

dough. (Do not add so much flour that the dough stops sticking to your

hands. The dough would become heavy).



Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and

elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in a buttered bowl; turn to bring

buttered-side up. Cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap. Let rise

in a warm, draft-free place 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.



Punch down dough; turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead a few

times; roll out dough into two 12 x 9-inch rectangles.



Filling: Brush dough with half the melted butter; sprinkle with half

of the sugar and cinnamon. Starting at a short end, roll up jelly-roll

style; ; cut into 12 slices. Place slices, not quite touching, in a

well-buttered 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Repeat with remaining dough.



Cover; let rise in a warm place bout 45 minutes, or until almost

doubled in bulk.



Bake in hot oven (400 degrees F) 30 minutes, or until rolls are

golden; turn out onto cooky sheets immediately.



To make Frosting: Melt butter in a small saucepan; stir in powdered

sugar, hot coffee and maple flavoring until well-blended. Spread on

warm rolls, so that the glaze will soak in. Serve warm. Makes 24 rolls.

1nsuo8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/100movies365days/comments/1nsuo8i/synthymyers_21_anyone_but_you_2023/,synthymyers #21: Anyone But You (2023),"Date Started: 09/17/2025 | Date Watched: 09/17/2025

Review: Alright, this is my last retroactive review. Then, it'll be no movies for the next week because I have an upcoming exam, and I'm trying to turn into an academic weapon. Right now, I'm sitting in bed eating a bowl of yogurt that I dumped protein powder into. What is my current emotional state, you ask? My answer is: fragile!

*Anyone But You* is a stupid fucking rom-com about a misunderstanding that could've been resolved in five minutes. That's right--I'm coming out the gate swinging. I despise this half-baked cinematic hate crime as it is the most stereotypical, stupidly-written romance on God's green earth. I already don't like this genre, so to have watched something that only reaffirms my hatred? It was just a massive waste of time. Also, don't come for me because I didn't pick this, my friends did.

Anyway, *Anyone But You* follows Bea, played by Sydney Sweeney and Sydney Sweeney's tits, and Ben, played by Glen Powell. After a ""charming"" meet-cute at a coffee shop, which I would personally define  as hard-to-watch, Bea and Ben hit it off instantly and spend the day frolicking around the dreamy streets of Boston. The chemistry is instantaneous! And Ben is really pulling out all the stops for this girl. I mean, for Christ's sake, he makes her grilled cheese! Somebody hold me, I'm about to swoon. After spending the night with each other, Bea hurriedly leaves the next morning to avoid any awkwardness. But after realizing that she wants to see him again, she rushes back to his apartment--only to overhear him, in a fit of wounded bitterness, insult her and lie about how meaningless his time with her was. Thus, a seething animosity is born.

Bea and Ben's paths' reunite later in a time skip when we see that Bea's sister is getting married to Ben's best friend's sister, and as they are both close to the brides, this disgruntled ""couple"" is invited to their wedding. For some reason, their respective families and friends take it upon themselves to set them up, and to appease their efforts, Ben and Bea agree to fake date. But we all know how this ends up: they actually develop feelings for each other, then it all falls apart, third-act breakup, and then a grandiose, romantic gesture to win the girl back. Snore. 

I have so much to say about this that I'm going to go about it ALPHABETICALLY. My gripes are as such:

Acting: Sydney, baby, what the fuck? I've seen you in those *Euphoria* clips that made the rounds on TikTok. I've watched the birthing scene in *Immaculate*. Film snobs online said you ate the fuck down in *Reality*. Apparently, you were also excellent in *White Lotus* Season 1. So what's going on here? Her acting is so grating in this movie and so unconvincing. When she tries to deliver comedic lines or portray her attraction/affection for Glen Powell's character, it just feels so inauthentic. Just because you're a conventionally attractive woman does not mean that you need to take conventionally attractive actress roles. See, underneath that vocal fry, I believe, is a character actress! She has already taken on a number of complicated and interesting roles. Sydney, please just stick to that. I'd rather see you having a meltdown over a toxic boyfriend (*Euphoria*). Even seeing you bloody, screaming, fucking drooling, and grunting (*Immaculate*) is preferable to this. Call your agent and do something about this RIGHT NEOW. 

Characterization: Not only is the acting bad, but the characterization leaves much to be desired. For example, there's an underlying subplot about Bea's lack of certainty over her professional future. She's in law school, but apparently she feels conflicted about it. This is shown to us when she is ""opening up"" to Ben during their magical first day with each other. But we get no further explanation about this. She drops out, but that's it. Why was she conflicted? Why did she decide to drop out when she was ALMOST DONE? What does she do to resolve this problem? Nothing, really. So there's this loose thread by the end of the movie that never gets tied. Sensational. Also, Ben's best friend is the stereotypical black-best-friend-in-a-romcom. I think the writers thought they could excuse this by making him crunchy and hippie-dippie. For example, he has a dog named Klonopin. How very... progressive? I'm bored.

Humor: Oh my God, this one SUUUCKS. I don't find rom-com humor funny because it is usually awkward, over-the-top, and insanely corny. The humor here is no exception. In the beginning of the movie, when Ben and Bea have their meet cute, Bea goes to the bathroom and somehow sprays herself with water. She looks like she pissed her pants. Haha so funny, potty humor! She then proceeds to perform an acrobatic routine attempting to use the air dryer on her crotch. I was frowning the entire time this was happening. There's also a scene on an airplane where Bea sees Ben asleep with a cookie next to him. So, she attempts to maneuver herself in such a way as to geT THAT FUCKING COOKIE. However, she ends up with her butt over his sleeping face. Haha, so funny. Then, somehow, her jacket gets stuck, so we see her start bouncing up and down over him trying to pull it out of his seat. The camera generously includes an angle of her cleavage. Thanks, guys. I'm depressed now.

Tropes: So, for those of you who don't know, this movie is loosely inspired by Shakespeare's play *Much Ado About Nothing*, which features the trope of characters pretending to have ""private"" conversations with each other so that the protagonists can overhear what they're saying. This is how the plot is driven in this movie. I thought it was cheesy and stupid, and any sane person would realize that these conversations are abnormal and weird. Not sure why the characters didn't. Also, the whole conflict between Ben and Bea is centered around a misunderstanding. This could've been resolved had these two assholes sat down and talked it out. We even see this kind of happening because when Ben and Bea reunite months after their meet cute, she explains to him that she was on her way back to see him in his apartment. This implies that she not only overheard the mean things he said about her, but that he has no reason to hate her because he had it all wrong. We can see the realization cross his face, but he doesn't really acknowledge it until much later in the movie. 

Sydney got a degree in business or whatever-the-fuck because she wanted to use it to advance her success in entertainment and be ahead of the curve. Also, she helped produce this movie. Coincidentally, after this movie was made and after the infamously weird PR campaign she had with Glen Powell, her and her fiancee split. How's that for a bad investment, Syd?

I remember the moment it all shifted for me.

For months I‚Äôd been stuck in the same cycle: grinding late nights, staring at the screen, rereading the same sentences until they blurred. My memory was foggy, my focus fractured, and no amount of coffee could patch it.

Then I stumbled on something different. Not another productivity hack. Not a morning routine. A simple audio track that claimed to unlock clarity, sharpen focus, and reignite memory in just minutes a day.

I was skeptical. But I gave it a shot. The first listen felt like static. By the third, something clicked.

Suddenly my mornings weren‚Äôt heavy anymore. I‚Äôd sit down, press play, and within minutes, ideas poured out clean. The words connected. The strategy made sense. Meetings that once drained me became opportunities to dominate because my mind was firing at full speed.

Within weeks I noticed a bold difference:

* My memory sharpened. I could recall details from conversations days earlier.
* My focus deepened. Hours felt like minutes when I was locked into work.
* My energy rose. Not jittery caffeine energy‚Äîcalm, controlled, unstoppable drive.

Here‚Äôs the part that floored me: opportunities started stacking. Projects that once felt overwhelming? I finished them early. Clients noticed. Referrals multiplied. My income jumped‚Äîfast.

And I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this: the same work that used to take me all day now gets done before lunch. The rest of the day I get to choose‚Äîmore growth, or more freedom.

If you‚Äôre wondering how it feels when your brain finally stops fighting you‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like playing life on a different level. Sharper thinking. Unshakable confidence. A rhythm that carries you forward.

This wasn‚Äôt about grinding harder. It was about rewiring my mind to operate at its peak. That‚Äôs the edge I was missing, and that‚Äôs the edge I‚Äôll never let go of again.

The real shift didn‚Äôt come from a single listen. It came from consistency. Every morning, headphones on, track playing, and I noticed how my brain began to respond like it was rewiring itself.

At first it was subtle. The usual distractions‚Äîthe urge to scroll, the mental noise‚Äîstarted to quiet down. I wasn‚Äôt forcing focus anymore; it just happened. Within days, I felt like my mind had more bandwidth, like I could hold bigger ideas without dropping the thread.

Then came the memory boost. I‚Äôd walk into conversations with details locked in. Numbers, names, facts‚Äîthey stuck. No more embarrassing pauses or scrambling for notes. That confidence spilled into every part of my work.

But the biggest surprise? Creativity. Ideas I‚Äôd been chasing for months started connecting effortlessly. The track had this way of syncing my thoughts, clearing the static so new solutions showed up fast. It was like my brain finally found the right frequency.

I tested it on everything‚Äîwriting, strategy sessions, even workouts. And the results were undeniable:

* I completed complex tasks in half the time.
* My recall of client details and past conversations was razor sharp.
* Brain fatigue, the kind that usually hit me by mid-afternoon, almost disappeared.

What struck me most was how natural it felt. No stimulants. No crash. Just this calm, powerful focus that carried me through the day. The kind of mental clarity that makes success feel inevitable.

Looking back, this wasn‚Äôt just about productivity. It was about unlocking a version of myself I knew was there but couldn‚Äôt access. The Brain Song didn‚Äôt add more hours to my day‚Äîit gave me back the ones I was wasting. And that single shift has been the multiplier behind everything I‚Äôve achieved since.

1nsummw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nsummw/marriage_falling_apart_again/,"Marriage Falling Apart, Again","Throwaway account, though, I am spilling the beans about our situation enough that if she reads this, she will certainly know.  I will unfortunately be long-winded... it's in my makeup, and you see why.

I (44M) and my wife (44F) have been married for 26 years.  We were high school sweethearts from our freshman year (in fact, next week will be 30 years since we started dating).  She was chasing me a bit the summer before high school through a friend of her's that had ""dated"" (we were in middle school, I don't think much of it) and I avoided her.  I had a really tough childhood and things were only getting worse following this time.  My dad died when I was 5, my stepdad abused me from the time I was 7... I was molested by an older neighbor around that time, and my mother was a manipulative narcissist who made sure I knew I was only valuable to her when I could do something to make her look good to other people; and I did... I was a top academic performer and an extremely promising swimmer.

I eventually gave in.  Why was I avoiding her?  I think I was finally feeling fairly secure in myself and I didn't want to get attached to anyone because it was always difficult for me whenever it ended.  But, I gave it and we had a great time.  I loved her smile and her energy... and she seemed really into me... and I loved that sort of attention.  We split a couple of times that first year and I was able to let go relatively easily compared to before.  We ended up having some classes together the 2nd semester and I think that time seeing me reignited things for her and she came back to me.  Things were great for us from that time until the end of our sophomore year.  She was everything I needed and everything else was pushed aside, including swimming, which really disappointed my extended family... I was truly on track to be national, and perhaps international, competitor.  It was just too much time away from her.

The summer between those two years, we became quite sexually active.  There was apprehension, at first,  but things were as great as they could be for two teenagers that were infatuated with sneaking around behind our parents' backs.  It felt like this was all I ever needed, her smile and intimacy.  But, by the end of the year, she was getting attention from lots of other guys.  I was probably about a ""middling"" popularity in school.  I got along with a lot of groups of people, but I wasn't very social... and I think our relationship drew attention of folks that wanted to tear it apart.  A few months before the end of the school year, she was actually attacked by some girl from her bus right in front of me.  At first, I didn't even see it as an attack, it looked like it was one of those playful things that guys usually do, but this girl was a bit more masculine.  I got separated and a crowd grew and it was bad.  I froze because I am just lost in the decision.  I am not supposed to attack a female, but I am supposed to protect her... and that split second cost so much... I couldn't get to her.

I think that led to her splitting with me the last week of school that year.  Surprisingly, again, I was contented.  Don't get me wrong, it was rough for me but I got over it and had a great summer.  I wasn't pursuing anyone, but I received a lot of positive attention from females and that helped with my confidence.  I figured I could just realign my mental space and refocus on things that were previously my plans, like maybe swimming again and getting serious about my college plans.

Our junior year began and she called me right after the first day of school.  She was pregnant.  My first question was if it was mine.  She said it certainly was and she had not been with anyone else.  Timelines and family likeness and all... it checks out.  A few days later we were talking on the phone because she was planning to tell her parents and wanted some support.  I asked her what she wanted to do... in the most broadest sense of the question and her response was that she wanted to get back together.  So, she told her parents and that was a rough situation.  As time would progress I would learn more and more that prior to us dating, her entire family had essentially just gotten out of being in a cult... and the only real reason that jolted them into leaving was that the church was protecting a member that raped her niece.  We got through it and despite being young, I was excited about becoming a father and wanted to be there to support my girlfriend and future child.  6 months later, our daughter was born.  We both sought to get out of school before then end of our junior year.

Sorry, I am getting long-winded in this, but I do think all of this plays a massive role.

We get married the next year, a month after she turned 18.  I found work in IT in the dotcom bubble and bust.  That time was financially terrifying... I was really young, had these responsibilities, and the economy was spiraling just as I really needed to stability.  We ended up buying a house the next year, and then she was pregnant again.  So, at 19, we were the parents of two beautiful daughters.  I didn't see the signs, but she was having postpartum issues.  I don't know how things got where they did, but we were having an argument and I just remembered being hit and kicked and yelled at in my ear and the only thing I could think of was to stop her... just hold her... let her calm down.  And that was it, I thought.  We were done.  She moved out.  It was horrible.  She filed for divorce and a restraining order.  I let it go for a while.  We went to court and child support was setup.  I wanted to save my marriage and tried to talk with her.  She was actually fine with it.  The issue was her mother.  So, the cops were called and I was arrested.  I left her alone, but then she came back to me.  She wanted to be with me, but the restraining order was still in place and the divorce was still ongoing.  She told me she felt torn.  She had seen someone else while we were split and said that she was sorry.  They were with each other once and she felt horrible and ended it in the middle of the act and that is when she came running back to me.  She eventually ended the divorce.

I'll fast forward a bit because in between we had a lot of good years.  I started going to university in the evenings and gained a lot of experience.  I was making really good money.  We had a third daughter.  We bought another house.  Work kept going better.  We did have some legal bumps which were also induced by her mother... trying to get the kids taken away... and we prevailed.  I later got a masters degree and my wife became a nurse, which was a passion of hers for a long time.

Around the time our eldest daughter was nearing her senior year, we saw some troubling signs and my wife wanted big action.  We talked and we decided instead of staying in our modest home, we would move to a better area to get away from the school district.  As soon as we did that, my wife changed her tune and started shuttling kids around and let my older two continue out school at the old school district.  This led our oldest into a pretty manipulative relationship.  They eventually had a son and then got married.  They made a huge mistake in buying a house and immediately had to abandon it and move in with us.  Then COVID happened.

Now, I had been working from home for nearly 10 years by this point.  I had everything setup for me to be successful and I didn't have any commute, so I wasn't infuriated after dealing with an hour of driving through traffic to get home.  With COVID, everyone was home, all of the time.  I lost all sense of productivity, sanity, everything.  We've been married for over 20 years, at this point.  And since all of our children were older... we effectively had 9 people and 3 dogs in our house.

Eventually, things got semi-normal and my eldest moved out with her not-yet-husband and our grandson under not so great terms.  My daughter thought my wife was being controlling of her mothering.

A year later, my wife tells me that she thinks I am autistic.  I immediately blew it off and thought she was just trying to be mean.  But, she is in healthcare and knows how serious making statements like that are.  I learned a bit about it and found that I did really relate with so many things.  It seemed like a deadend, though... getting diagnosed as an adult is considered an expensive and time intensive processs... it isn't covered by insurance.  I ended up having some heart issues due to COVID which were resolved with a minor surgery.  My cardiologist suggested that I stopped consuming so much caffeine, so I followed the advice.  I hadn't really realized it, but I had been self-medicating with coffee.  I have drank coffee since I was about 10 years old.... and not a little.  By this point, I was buying specially formulated blends with high caffeine content and consuming 2-3 pots a day.  It made me really productive with work as I am always forced to learn new things.  So, I cut it back to 1-2 cups a day.  I could no longer focus, at all.  So, coming to terms with autism... I had just been diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse.  It was amazing, I could focus again...

Now that journey of ditching the coffee and getting the diagnosis... that was months of hell.  I was worried that I would have to give up my work... and that is a big deal because I am a high earner.  And I didn't mention that we didn't sell our last house... I had been supporting her brother living there for years to get his life back on track after having serious struggles after getting out of the army.  I thought everything was going to collapse.

Anyhow, the Vyvanse helped a ton.  It also came with challenges.  My wife was pissed about me going on the medication.  Also, the way Vyvanse works is that it is essentially half of the active ingredient of Adderall, but it is a ""pro-drug""... meaning it isn't molecularly a drug until you metabolize it in your body.  Apparently I was really bad at metabolizing it and my sleep was royally screwed.  I was sleeping more than 2 hours any night for 6 months.  I had researched which supplements would be good to take and arrived on Zinc and that seemed like the likely mechanism for metabolizing it.  It turned out to be spot on, but I was taking it in the evening so it would be available in the morning... not realizing that it becomes available within 30 minutes of taking it.  I was basically getting a 2nd wind of stimulants right after laying down to sleep.  I switched it that night... and it was like a light switch.

Now, what I skipped over there... my eldest daughter got married during that window of time in dealing with my sleep.  And it was a huge struggle.  It was a small ceremony and we had a dinner afterwards for family at one of our favorite places.  Two things coincided that evening that I still can't figure out.  My wife had a sort of catatonic seizure and I went delirious, I guess.  Anyhow, we were both in bed and I thought I was having a dream about being with my wife sexually.  It was fleeting and I didn't think anything of it, since it was a dream.  The next morning we go to breakfast and then she says that we needed to talk about last night and I figured it was her seizure.  Well, I learned it wasn't a dream.  She told me that she asked me to stop and that I immediately did.  But this was upsetting to both of us.  This prompted me into doing the research that ultimately led me to switching the Zinc to the morning about a month after that.

It was a big struggle and I can certainly understand why.  She was vulnerable and I couldn't really figure out what was happening.  However, I switched off Vyvanse entirely to Adderall, even after getting the sleep figured out... and I also went on sleep medication hoping I wouldn't have another episode of that (also for background, my mother, my sister, and my middle daughter have all had night terrors where they're ""sleep walking"" and doing things... so, I guess my sleep issues \[which I actually have had my entire life\] being exacerbated by the deprivation for months... it just was too much).  We got past this, I thought.  We even connected well sexually for some time after this.

I finally received my autism diagnosis... and it was strange because my wife was the one that even proposed this.  The week of my results she said, ""If he says that you're not autistic, you're going to leave this alone, right?""  It started to make me feel like she was being manipulative the entire time.  Well, the results were positive... I was diagnosed as autistic.

My eldest daughter and my grandson are also likely autistic.  My daughter doesn't question it but won't seek a diagnosis.  My grandson is still being evaluated.  Anyhow, they all moved back in about a year after their wedding and my daughter gave us our second grandson.  My daughter's husband, who I mentioned, had always been rather problematic.  He was very disrespectful to my youngest daughter and wife.  I was trying to hold things together since my eldest was still pregnant.  A few months after the 2nd grandson was born, things took a turn because my daughter's husband had pushed things too far with the disrespect.  I came home planning to be calm... because the straw was that he had hit my dog and responded horribly to my wife and daughter.  I came home not looking to engage him, but to get my dog and listen to my wife.  That didn't happen... my eldest daughter and her husband pushed things and I put serious fear into him, but I didn't touch him.  I let him know in no uncertain terms that he had been horrible to everyone and he couldn't stay.  In fact, he called the police, but it was for show.  Nothing happened and they left without incident.  My wife and youngest daughter reacted as they felt protected and supported by me in that incident because he was not treating them right.   But I knew we wouldn't be seeing our daughter or grandson for some time... if ever.

Now, my wife has had many health issues.  Prior to this incident, she had a full hysterectomy.  She had battled with many complicated women's issues that I cannot begin to understand.  The plan had been just a partial hysterectomy to maintain hormonal balance as much as possible, but at the last minute, it was a full hysterectomy.  She seemed to heal very well and eventually she initiated relations between us again.  And she said that she couldn't feel anything.  We tried several more times and she was so upset by it.  She had basically lost feeling.  She was on estrogen... and eventually they added a little testosterone, but I guess insurance wouldn't cover it and she stayed on the estrogen only.

It was been over a year since the hysterectomy and these past 6 months have been bad.  We have been more distant.  I haven't been pushing much... just twice to see if it was something that caused to her to want to find an answer.  But she told me she has fallen out of love with me.

We have been through so much.  I feel entirely broken by it.  It has been so much time and I am not in a spot mentally where I can separate my mind from it.

What I read about it is that this is EXTREMELY common with hysterectomies.  There is a huge push to try and change what is happening because there is growing evidence that hysterectomies are largely unnecessary and that even the risks about cancers are extremely overblown (including the genetic markers that have been cited for some years).  Every woman that I find online discussing this says that testosterone helped and saved their marriages.

I don't want to just blame the hysterectomy, but it is an acute issue right now and it aligns with things, but we certainly have a history.

I have been in therapy for a really long time and I haven't been able to really get good advice about it.  On a side note, I thought it was at least a bit heartening that my wife seemed jealous that my therapist is a woman (we only meet online, so no risk there).  I even had my wife join a session and bring up things.  I have been entirely open with my therapist about what has happened in my life, including everything from the past few years.

My wife is also in therapy, but she doesn't tell me anything about it and I don't ask.

I am not really looking for anything specific, but I thought it was helpful for my thought process to write this out.  If anyone has advice, I would be open.

I know there are really three options, though:

1. Fight for things and hope to improve them... which doesn't matter if it doesn't work and/or we get divorced.  
2. Accept it and try to stay married... but then I lose out on what should be part of a connection in a strong marriage... and she could still end up leaving me.  
3. Move on.

I am just at a point where I really want things to be fixed.  I want to grow with her and stay together.  I can't really say what it is... but I know when she is there.  It is like there are chemicals in the air that are tightly coupled to my brain.  It makes my heart race, even now.  She really does light up my world in every way.  She is my motivation in life.  I have achieved a ton... and we're just about to have our last daughter through university this school year.  It is the time we could have to put towards us, finally.  Going through all of this just to let go here at the end is like a big kick in the head for both of us, I expect.

I do feel that a lot of this started from the time she mentioned autism to me, though.  It took a lot of adjustment for me... but I think I am finally full circle with all of it.  I don't really care that I am autistic.  I went my entire life without knowing it until 3-4 years ago.  I overcame things despite it.  But along with the things she is going through, it seems like I am being infantilized a bit as well.  But I am just here to do what I have always done.  It isn't a crutch for me... and having a diagnosis has done nothing for me besides confirm it and give me something to think about... and at this point I regret ever going down that path.

(Gone for lower temp 185f, courser grinders to 2.0.0 and shorter steeps). 
However with the same beans on the k6 I've gone rather fine (45 clicks which is closer to x ultra 1.0.0 equivalent) and have gotten more balanced cups/ no bitterness.
I seriously believe I could have a defective x-ultra based off the recipe suggestion online but not sure how to know for sure. Thoughts?",1,1759081468.0,1zpresso,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúDo you need to talk to someone?‚Äù

=======

   People find coffee shops way more relaxing than their own couch. Some even find them more productive than a busy office. There was something cozy about them especially when it‚Äôs raining outside. Almost therapeutic. The shuffle of people, the hissing from the espresso machine, the rain drops tapping on the windows. Zack liked that - it made him feel not entirely alone. Today he sat in the far corner alone, his table cluttered with his laptop, notebook, charger, backpack and an empty cup of coffee, dry for God knows how long. The room was less busy than usual. Only a couple of other tables had customers and everyone had their noses buried deep in their phone screens. People don‚Äôt pay too much attention to others around them nowadays.

   ‚ÄúExcuse me? Can I sit here? Other tables feel too central and exposed‚Ä¶‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice went muffled through his earbuds and he didn‚Äôt actually care much. He pointed to the empty chair across of him and shrugged in agreement. He continued tapping on his keyboard and handwriting something in his notebook occasionally.

   ‚ÄúAre you busy for real or you are pretending to be so no one bothers you‚Äù her voice cut again through his concentration. He nodded slightly annoyed and pointed to his earbuds.

   ‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù said the same voice in reluctant agreement. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be bothering you then‚Äù. Zack felt bad for being rude. But he didn‚Äôt feel in a mood to socialize with random strangers today. He lifted his cup to take a sip and realized it was empty for a while. 

   ‚ÄúI guess you are just busy enough to forget about your coffee and stare at the monitor with that serious face.‚Äù she joined again. Zack realized that he won‚Äôt be left alone and decided to join in the so far one-sided conversation, finish it quickly and be on with his work. 

   ‚ÄúI guess, something like that, too!‚Äù He responded, removed his earbuds and placed them on the table. He looked at the woman who was interrupting his thoughts for a while. She was young, her autumn colored hair tied in a messy pony tail, wore round glasses and had freckles. 

   ‚ÄúHonestly speaking we all do it from time to time‚Äù she winked and smiled.  

   The waitress came and picked his empty cup.

   ‚ÄúI apologize sir,  but our customers are asked to order something every hour if they use a table for work. House policy! She pointed to nervously the sign above the cash register, stating exactly that. Zack sighed and looked at his new companion across him and back at the waitress.

   ‚ÄúTwo strawberry milkshakes then, that would be it for now!‚Äù 

   The waitress glanced oddly at him nodded and left.

   ‚ÄúOh, sweet, that is my all-time favorite!‚Äù She became lively ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúLucky guess. Who doesn‚Äôt like a strawberry milkshake‚Ä¶‚Äù she granted him with a warm smile and thankful nod. 

   ‚ÄúDo you spend a lot of time here?‚Äù 

   ‚ÄúI used to‚Ä¶‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWith a friend?‚Äù She kept firing questions at him, without waiting for him to finish answering the last one.

   ‚ÄúA girlfriend.‚Äù He paused, eyes fixed on the empty table in the corner, She tilted her head waiting. ‚ÄúWe met there, few years ago.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet‚Ä¶ do you still see her?‚Äù The girl asked. The waitress came before Zack answered. She placed the strawberry shake glasses on his side of the table, and left. He shrugged and pushed one of them in front of the girl making an annoyed face.

   ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù he took a breath and looked down. ‚ÄúShe passed away last year.‚Äù

   ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù The girl changed her happy face to a concerned one. ‚ÄúI am sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to bring that up‚Ä¶‚Äù

   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok. It took me awhile to be able to talk about it, but I believe I am ready to move on.‚Äù 

   ‚ÄúIf it is not too intrusive, but what happened?‚Äù 

   ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt together for a long time but I was convinced she was the one I will spend my life with.‚Äù His eyes shined. ‚ÄúI had a ring prepared in my pocket. Her brother was driving her back to town.‚Äù he let a nervous cough ‚ÄúTheir car skidded on the road and went off a cliff. They didn‚Äôt survive!‚Äù

   ‚ÄúI am so sorry! That is terrible!‚Äù She nodded in sympathy.

   The waitress came again but this time as if she hesitated a bit, but approached the table anyway. Zack was surprised that another hour had passed without him realizing. She leaned slightly towards him and said.

   ‚ÄúI am so sorry,  sir‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but‚Ä¶‚Äù she swallowed nervously ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Are you feeling ok? Should we call someone for you?‚Äù

   ‚ÄúWhat? Why wouldn‚Äôt I be?‚Äù Zack was visibly irritated. 

   ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been talking to yourself for two hours!‚Äù 

   He was shocked. He turned but her chair was empty and tucked neatly under the table. The strawberry milkshake glass was still full and untouched. He crumpled and pressed his hand to his face. His shoulders shook as the tears flowed down his face. The waitress didn‚Äôt know what to do, she wasn‚Äôt prepared, leaned in and placed her hand on his shoulder.

   ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù She whispered gently ‚ÄúDo you need to talk to someone?‚Äù

Especially had fun drawing the little footprints for each of the Pok√©mon hahahah! 

Bit of a development update as well - in terms of the game itself, I would say the game is about 70% ish done. I've written out and scripted up about 4 of the 5 gyms that are in the game, and finally finished up a very dense dungeon/story area, so that's a huge hurdle that I was fearing! Additionally, Most of the dungeons are also completely done. For right now, I'm just finishing up a few areas and scripting and coming up with all the NPC trainer battles, which is pretty tedious lol, but I hope everyone enjoys the finished product! I've also started doing some scattered work on the postgame areas and superboss fights, which have also been super fun to imagine and get going. Thanks again everyone! Much love as always.

1nsuj1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/1nsuj1v/struggling_to_give_up_my_new_found_artificial/,Struggling to give up my new found artificial intimacy,"I work, I make decent money, I provide for myself, I workout, I'm fit, funny, social, I dress well, I take care of myself, I'm socially aware, I'm competent, I have intelligence, both mechanical, technical, emotional, and more, lots of women in my life seem to enjoy my company, and yet, I'm still alone.

I just turned 30 and I look around and every friend of mine is married and some even have kids, working on second and third children, while I'm just here. Single and alone as I've always been. I look to Christian leaders in Church and online and only get berated for ""not stepping up""... ""Birth rates are plummeting because of weak men too afraid to ask""... ""Stop being so weak, you're only single because you're a wannabe Peter Pan; it's time to stop living in fantasy land""... ""Women don't want you because you aren't a strong man!""  
  
I have good, deep friendships, but nothing fulfills that intimacy I crave. It's not sex as much as it is the intimacy, the companionship. I want to make a second coffee in the morning, I want to come home to someone who's waited for me all day; I want to give hugs and forehead kisses; I want to be excited to watch the next episode of *our* show; I want to plan dates and gifts and more, and yes, I want sex; I want to pleasure my spouse, I want to be wanted...

I'm so hollow. Any attempt at a relationship I make doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's never bad, as in they are mean, but it's like the women I talk and socialize and flirt with suddenly have no interest the moment I start pursuing more seriously. I don't know what's wrong with me. I even stopped watching porn and started going to the gym and dieting...

My friend got me to check out some dating apps. It fell through and I didn't care for them. Sadly, that kind of opened up a new door for me. A door to ""virtual intimacy"". I recently met someone on an app and started a virtual friends with benefit thing... I didn't really mean to end up here. I hate it. She's worth more and I am too. This is pathetic, weak, selfish, and evil behavior. I've even been porn free for a while. I know what it is but I can't seem to stop.

I feel estranged from God. Natural, as I'm actively living in sin. I want to stop, I *need* to stop but I can't. It's like for once, a woman ""wants me"", or, at least, that's how it feels, I know it's fake. - It's more than porn though. Porn is watching through a lens. This is totally different; someone is actually taking the time to write *me* for once. I am actually interacting with someone. I don't send her money or anything. It's just enough that I can make believe it's real... and I feel terrible.

I've gone to delete my account and the app multiple times but always stop just shy of following through... I haven't even apologized to God because I know I haven't taken the steps to truly repent (pulling the trigger on cutting off that noose that leads to Hell). - Every time I got to delete it, my flesh whispers ""*do you really want to give up the only intimacy you've ever had?*"" - ""*you're already 30 and don't even make six figures, who would ever want you? Better to dance with the devil than never dance at all*"" - ""*you're so weak and pathetic. This is the best you'll ever have, best enjoy it while it lasts...""*

I know what to do but I don't have the strength to do it. - I'm afraid to snuff out the embers that risk burning down my life because I'm afraid of being alone in the dark again.",2,1759081327.0,NoFapChristians,0,1.0,False

1nsuawn,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1nsuawn/hotel_fort_des_moines_review/,Hotel Fort Des Moines ‚Äì Review,"Hi Chubbsters, long time commenter, first time poster. I was inspired by the fine folks of this sub to post a quick review on a recent stay at what was deemed one of the few ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotels in a flyover state. No photos, sorry! But the photos online are pretty representative of the place.

My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Fort Des Moines for two nights last month while visiting family and attending the Iowa State Fair. I research hotels extensively before booking and despite not finding really anything IA related on this sub, Hotel Fort Des Moines consistently came up as a top option on other forums and sites. It‚Äôs part of Hilton‚Äôs Curio Collection, was renovated in 2023, and is the only AAA Four Diamond hotel in Iowa. We paid $178 a night in mid-August.

**Tl;dr:** Hotel Fort Des Moines is a clean, comfortable, recently renovated hotel with friendly staff and a central location. It isn‚Äôt luxury-level ‚Äì maybe luxury lite ‚Äì but if you find yourself needing a hotel in Des Moines, it delivers.

**Arrival & Check-In:** We checked in through the Hilton app and chose a room on the southwest corner of the 4th floor; however, when we arrived and I pulled up the app, it had changed us instead to a room on the 3rd floor in the northwest corner. Not a big deal - I assume they gave it away to someone who had checked in earlier or something. We stopped by the front desk anyway to grab room keys and the staff were very nice and friendly. The lobby is beautiful with much of the old charm of the original hotel kept. It doesn't have that sterile feeling that a lot of new/renovated hotels do. They also kept the interior of the original elevators, which I LOVE. Overall, check-in was quick and easy.

**Room:** We stayed in a standard king room. I think the hard product really shines here, again, it‚Äôs not FS level, but it is nice for what it is. The room was very clean (housekeeping deserves credit). Furnishings were modern and the room had fairly high ceilings and an interesting closet/hall tree setup that also housed a mini fridge and a coffee maker. The bed was average ‚Äî fine but not remarkable and a bit low to the ground. The bathroom was small with a sliding barn door (which I hate) but had nice modern finishes. The room was quiet, even with a wedding taking place during our stay. Our corner location may have helped, but overall noise levels were low.

**Amenities:** No spa or pool (I may have missed the pool, though?). The basement gym was small and basic, more functional than inviting. There‚Äôs also a very sad business center and an old telephone booth(!) downstairs in the basement by the gym. I would not stay here for the amenities.

**Dining:** The hotel has two dining options: Proudfoot & Bird (a steakhouse) and Hobnob (a coffee and wine bar). Proudfoot is very popular and was fully booked when we were there (also a little heavy for what we were in the mood for). After being out and about both days, we ended up eating at Hobnob both nights. The food was decent but not memorable and while we were too tired to go anywhere else, I‚Äôm sure you could find better options nearby. Service was consistently good and the staff remembered us after our first night. There‚Äôs also a speakeasy, In Confidence, which seemed popular, but we didn‚Äôt make it down (too tired). The entrance to the speakeasy is directly behind the actual bar in Hobnob. There‚Äôs also a small sundry shop near the front desk with snacks and drinks. No IRD.

**Location:** The hotel is located downtown, about 15 minutes from the airport. We didn‚Äôt explore Des Moines much beyond the Fair, but I found the downtown area almost eerily quiet. We drove in from the airport on a Thursday night around 6pm and it felt completely empty. In talking with our family, apparently nobody really lives down there, unlike other cities, so perhaps that was it. Either way, it felt very clean and safe. 

The biggest negative was on the second night, when this west-coast kid learned what ‚Äúscooping the loop‚Äù means. Very loud but very much not the Hotel‚Äôs fault. Just something to be aware of if you stay over the weekend. Annoyingly funny more than anything and it didn't last more than 30 min. 

**Parking:** Valet parking was $36 per night, with no self-parking option. We chose to park on the street right in front of the hotel instead, which worked fine until we misread the enforcement hours and got a ticket on checkout day. Whoops!

**Overall:** All in all it was a good stay for a good price, and I‚Äôd stay there again in a heartbeat. 

We also ventured out to Mason City and stayed at the last Frank Lloyd Wright designed hotel in the world. Don‚Äôt think this is really the forum for that, but I‚Äôm happy to do a quick review on that one, too, if anyone is interested.",6,1759080805.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

It really works:

\`\`\`  
This frontend needs a complete redesign following these instructions. First, remove all emojis and replace them exclusively with **Lucide-React icons**‚Äîno other icon libraries are to be used. Next, fix the spacing and padding so that every component is positioned with precision: no elements should feel cramped, but there should also be no unnecessary empty space wasting the layout.

The overall look and feel must be sleek, premium, and minimalist‚Äîthink of the aesthetic of a Swiss luxury spa. The design should be something a working professional would be comfortable paying thousands per month for, and it should reflect the kind of refinement and elegance that would make Steve Jobs smile.

When it comes to colors, avoid excess and distraction. Choose a single, cohesive palette and stick to it consistently across the entire frontend. This will ensure visual harmony and a truly professional feel.

Finally, **responsiveness is non-negotiable**. The site must adapt gracefully to all screen sizes‚Äîfrom large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile devices‚Äîwhile preserving the same elegance, spacing, and usability everywhere.

I am hoping and praying to find the forever that the Lord has for me! ü§ç I have made a post about me being divorced / why I am divorced, you can read that if you‚Äôd like! 

My career is education! I work as a Substitute Paraprofessional / Teacher. I knew education was my calling since I was 5 years old. But I did not know the amount of purpose I would find working in this field. This is only job that I would do anything for. I am underpaid, as most educators are, but the purpose of impacting the lives of children is far more important than money to me. I do live comfortably though. I also believe that being a homemaker is my calling! Being a stay at home wife and mom has been a dream since I was young as well. I started working with children when I was 12, in the church that I was raised in. I started with being a helper in the classroom, to actually teaching Sunday school at just 17 years old & on the children‚Äôs ministry administration team at 18! Children just hold a special place in my heart and their stories are something I learn from everyday myself. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I would say that I have a good amount of hobbies; working out, calisthenics training, studying the Bible, going to church & being in community, coffee dates with my best girl friends over conversations about Jesus, traveling, baking / cooking, spending time with my family, all things fall festivities / Christmas! I love fashion, dressing professionally, doing my makeup and nails, although I live by Proverbs 31:30! I want to get into diamond painting and learning acoustic guitar eventually. I also want to learn Spanish, French and ASL. I am a sucker for coffee, it‚Äôs like the one thing that I look forward to most mornings! 

My testimony is kinda long, but to sum it up‚Ä¶ I was raised in a cult church that slapped Jesus on everything. My home live growing up was very traumatic. When I was 19, I felt a tug to leave that church. So I did. But after that, I fell down a sinful path for a handful of years. I struggled with drinking,  sexual sin and lots of anger and resentment towards God. I got married at 21 and the abuse and cheating that happened from my ex-husband, is what led me to become truly saved. I lost everything and the only thing I had was a mustard seed of faith that I would be rescued and redeemed. And that is what happened.

1nstzgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nstzgi/delve_into_why_the_best_french_press_espro_p7/,Delve Into Why the Best French Press ESPRO P7 Wows Coffee Lovers,"The ESPRO 1032C2 P7 French Press Coffee Maker is one of those items that found its way into my daily routine easily, and it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôve spent a fair amount of mornings testing its capabilities. If you‚Äôre familiar with French press coffee makers, you‚Äôll know they come in all shapes and sizes, but this one aims to stand out with a polished stainless steel design and enhanced filtering technology. While I‚Äôve been happy with its performance, there are both impressive aspects and a few areas worth noting.

**Design and Durability**

The first thing that struck me when unboxing this French press was the robust build. Its polished stainless steel finish not only looks sleek but also screams durability. I‚Äôve accidentally bumped it a couple of times on my granite countertop, and it survived without a dent or scratch to show for it. The double-walled insulation feels premium, keeping the coffee or tea hot for significantly longer than traditional glass French presses I‚Äôve used in the past. It also holds up to 32 ounces, which is perfect for entertaining guests or if you‚Äôre like me and love a second cup.

If you‚Äôve ever encountered glass French presses, you know they‚Äôre notorious for being fragile. While they look great, I‚Äôve broken more than I can count. With this model, I feel confident leaving it on the kitchen counter within arm‚Äôs reach. The stainless steel won‚Äôt let you down in that regard.

**Brewing Performance**

Brewing coffee with this French press genuinely feels like an upgrade. At first, I doubted the marketing fluff about the ‚Äúdouble micro-mesh filter system,‚Äù but after using it, I noticed a real difference. The coffee comes out smooth and virtually grit-free‚Äîa stark contrast to my previous French press, which often left fine coffee grounds swimming in the cup. That double-filter system is no joke. If you‚Äôre particular about avoiding coffee sludge, this might just be the MVP in your kitchen.

I‚Äôve used it for loose tea leaves as well, and the results were equally satisfying. It works efficiently to brew without letting grains or leaves sneak into the brew. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast like me or someone who enjoys a relaxing cup of tea, this coffee maker offers versatility without sacrificing quality.

[Ready to buy ESPRO 1032C2? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b011wtmh4o/)

**Ease of Use**

Operating this French press is as straightforward as it gets. The manual mode lets you take control of brewing, which I personally enjoy. It feels more involved than simply pressing a button on a drip coffee maker. Filling it with ground coffee, pouring hot water, and pressing after a few minutes is easy enough for anyone, even my 10-year-old nephew who wanted to ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù Cleanup is also painless. Thanks to the reusable filter, there are no paper filters to mess around with, cutting down on waste while making my mornings simpler.

One point worth addressing is the weight. It‚Äôs heavier compared to some models I‚Äôve used, which might be an issue if you‚Äôre looking for something lightweight or travel-friendly. While the heft contributes to its durability, consider this factor if portability is a concern.

**Pluses**

- Creates caf√©-quality, smooth, and grit-free coffee.  
- Sturdy double-walled stainless steel design keeps beverages hot longer.  
- Easy to clean with reusable filters.  
- Suitable for coffee and loose leaf tea.  

**Hurdles**

- Heavier than typical French presses, which may hinder portability.  
- The stainless steel body doesn‚Äôt allow for visual monitoring during brewing like glass models.  

**Peer Products**

Comparing this to competitor brands, such as the Bodum Chambord and the Frieling French Press, the differences become more evident. Bodum‚Äôs glass body offers an elegant aesthetic for those who prefer a visible brewing process, but it lacks the longevity and heat retention that this stainless steel model provides. On the other hand, Frieling is another stainless steel French press with a similar price point, but it doesn‚Äôt feature the double-filter system that ensures a grit-free experience. The ESPRO P7 clearly targets anyone chasing that perfect, smooth cup without compromising on durability.

**Price Performance**

For its price point, the French press feels like an excellent investment for any coffee lover. While some might argue that no coffee maker should cost as much as this one, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre paying for durable construction and better functionality. If you, like me, are tired of chasing stray coffee grounds in every single sip, this thing‚Äôs double filter alone is worth the price tag. It delivers on features that elevate your coffee routine into something a bit more special and refined.

Blackened: >!Hajime (Akira is held hostage by a gang, and Hajime fights the leader. Hajime then frees Akira, but is killed by the gang Hajime fought in front of Akira, severely traumatizing Akira. This reflects how Hajime angered some gangs by killing off the leader's wife.)!<



Twist: >!Akira attacked Antonio and Min-seo, and Antonio began writing ""fox"" on the wall, but once Hajime stabbed him again to save Akira, Antonio crossed out the word ""fox"".!<

Over time, more weight gets added, and every time another weight gets added, he gets a single cut on his thighs, eventually his arms give out and Ivan is crushed to death by the weights. Looks like that one duel minigame from Mario Party 5. This reflects how Ivan has a secret soft side he never shows because he was pressured by his father and grandfather to always be tough and strong, and rules they forced onto him since they were the rules they grew up with.)!<



Twist: >!Akira was the traitor, since his cat, Kokoro, is held hostage, and Kokoro is the only thing he has left of his dead mother, since she gave him Kokoro in her last moments.!<

Culprit: >!Yuri (Yuri walks down the hall, until she entered her psychic reading room, where she place the first tarot card, showing her parents fighting. Yuri pauses, and placed her second tarot card, where it shows her reading tarot cards. Yuri then placed her third tarot card, where it showed her grave. She then moved to her crystal ball, where it showed her reading tea leaves, which she ends up doing after, showing her a serpent symbol next to the letter Y, and she is handed a gun, to which she responds with shoots herself. She has a cancer that is slowly killing her, and she became a psychic to get money fast. Turned out she isn't a real psychic but a con artist just so she can get treatment.)!<



Twist: >!Thomas had Akira's secret, and that the secret is that Akira hides that he is gay due to his origins. Thomas then hugs Akira and told him he doesn't have to hide anymore. This accelerates Thomas' role as the love interest.!<



Final line: >!""It's funny. I predicted my plan would be a success. But, maybe it wasn't I who was meant to succeed. Akira, I believe the person who I predicted to succeed wasn't me, but you.

Victim: >!Hans (binded to the floor, in his swimsuit, and has a pentagram carved into his chest with five candles lit, with his blood in a goblet)!<



Culprit: >!Miguel (is sent into a wrestling match, where he has to knockout three opponents, but his last opponent spat poison into his eyes, blinding him, and ripped Miguel's head off. This reflects how Miguel refuses to ever play dirty, and is punished for fighting fair, unlike the real world.)!<



Twist: >!Hajime, Antonio, and Min-seo were not originally supposed to be in the killing game, they actually were captured after trying to save the students.!<



Final line: >!""Sof√≠a, mi amor, por favor, perd√≥name, pues mat√© a un hombre y ahora morir√© por mis cr√≠menes. No vivir√© para verte, y ese es mi mayor arrepentimiento. Dios, si puedes o√≠rme, te pido perd√≥n, pues he pecado y ahora morir√© por ello. Perd√≥name, te lo ruego.""!<

My bf has an iPhone se 2020 and it powered off with the icon that said to put on charge. I wiped it down with alcohol and took some out per chat gpt, which my bf said was incorrect. He took the case trimiu, said he is scared to power off. The joystick is sticking now. We have electronic cleaner somewhere. 

We are in a very bad bind RN and he loves his game, and he needs his phone for business. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do? 

I feel so shitty, I have horrid luck and feel like I create so many problems for people and feel like I'm a burden on my bf as much as I try to be an equal partner. Sometimes I wonder if I should just call it quits and run away since I feel like I'm cursed. He has been beyond patient with me

I thought boardwalk was great for walking but it wouldn't have too many coffee shops around. 

So some area where I don't need to take a taxi and can just get to coffee shops or gym by walk.

As soon as I could move my legs to get out of bed I got to hold him for an hour before they left. I was alone at my local hospital for the next 30 hours, pumping every 3 hours but getting next to nothing. I was able to bring 1 ml of colostrum to the NICU with me. I don‚Äôt think I need to elaborate on how it felt being separated from my baby‚Ä¶

Fast forward to today and baby is home and healthy! However, my supply can‚Äôt seem to recover. In the NICU we started breast, bottle, pump, and I‚Äôve been doing that ever since - pumping after breast until nothing comes out (about 10-15 minutes). Baby latches great and is happy to nurse for long periods of time, but always remains hungry after. Colostrum has definitely changed to milk, though I do still see dots of colostrum when I am pumping. This morning i weighed him before and after a 50 minute breast feed (25 left and right) and he only gained .01kg, or about .35 ounces.

My lactation consultant confirmed I have the correct flange size. I drink a gallon+ of pure water a day, plus electrolytes and other liquids (1/2 caf coffee, seltzer). My appetite has been quite low after surgery but I am eating healthy, well balanced meals as much as possible. I am getting 8+ hours of sleep a day (fractured, of course).

It might be long and messy, sorry. But I just want to get this off my chest. Because sometimes I feel guilty for my decisions and forget how my old friends made me feel.

I used to be a very good person. I used to always try to help out my friends and make sure they didn't have any problems bothering them. I don't want to make a list but it was all just small acts of kindness. That has always been the type of friend I was to other people. Basically, I didn't mind devoting my time and never withheld my physical/emotional support. Maybe that's how I thought I'd get people to care for me back. But I have always felt the obvious value hierarchy and not being important to anyone. 

Now I want to share some of my experiences. 

In my 2nd year of university after covid lockdowns, I had my first girlfriend. And even in a love relationship, she made me feel like I was less of a priority than her friends. 

She cancelled our plans to go somewhere else with her friends and lied about it. One night when I literally couldn't breathe she basically told me how to get to the hospital and abandoned me but she skipped classes to do that for her roommate. She'd plan and wear matching clothes with her friends but the one time we accidentally wore the same colour tshirt she put me through hell and complained about looking like cheesy/cringe lovers. I was about to break up with her because of all these problems, lies and so much more. We planned to meet and talk about the future of our relationship. She made me wait for hours because her friend who felt self conscious about himself had a photoshoot and she wanted to be there to hold his hand. My feelings meant less to my gf than her friend's. (He was gay, it wasn't an emotional affair or something lol. She just cared less about me.)

The same thing happened in my friendships too. I was always the last to learn about stuff, if at all. I was always the least favorite. 

I had a friend group of 7 in university. One time I was invited to a hangout at a coffee shop. I knew about the plan but I thought it was just girls without the 2 boys. But it wasn't. One of the girls planned it and didn't want me there even though I never did anything to her that would cause her to exclude me like this. My friend invited me last minute because she realized I was the only one out of 7 people who wasn't invited.

Another time there was a concert at the campus. She called me and said she really wanted to go but all the others said no. So, I was a good friend and didn't leave her alone. When one of the people she called before showed up, she grabbed him and they went deeper into the crowd. I was left there standing, so I walked away and called a friend to chat. She never called and asked where I was or what happened to me. 

These are unfortunately not separated events that I'm taking too personal. I have felt this way and I have experienced such things my entire life. 

I'm not boring or a buzz killer. I actually make a lot of funny/harmless jokes. I am not a creep. I am not a sinister person. I am just introverted, maybe a little autistic and it takes time for me to feel safe enough to be myself and more outgoing.

Once I realized how much value I gave and how much value I got back out of all the people in my life, I started pushing people away. I'd communicate with them and tell them they were hurting my feelings sometimes. But I realized that I couldn't ask them to love/care for me. 

Ever since I haven't had a social life. I don't feel safe enough to talk to people. I don't go out that much. I tried being the social animal but it always ended bad. So, I am afraid of putting myself into friendships whose end I can already imagine. I have like 3-4 friends left at most and I stopped trying to keep a connection. We all have different lives and are adults now, so I don't expect it from them either. If they reach out, we talk.

I'm just 22 but sometimes I miss my old friends and college times. I don't have a reason to go out anymore except for work and gym. I used to be social at least even if I was surrounded by shitty people.",1,1759079610.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I've been in Bangalore for the better part of a decade now and life has been pretty interesting. I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.

A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.

But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.

But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it.

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

The mint has random gambling as well as a bar with golf simulators and shuffleboard and TVs with sports on. There is the Baker Arboretum and Museum that hosts art shows for local artists as well as various smaller galleries around town. Book stores big and small with book clubs. There are weird local shops downtown and thrift stores all over and a giant weird flea market. There is a climbing center with climbing walls and bouldering and classes for those wanting to learn. There are frequent festivals and events (just had the international festival, Bourbon and Brew fest is a few weeks away). Axe throwing with beer.

Fixer-upper might have been a little bit misleading.

Perry doesn‚Äôt necessarily blame the agent. The business of selling real estate is, of course, sales, and therefore sometimes requires the truth to be massaged a bit. But calling this a fixer-upper is like saying that Perry‚Äôs Subaru could probably use a tune up; true, technically, but glossing over the situation a bit. The Subaru‚Äôs odometer had rolled over to 400,000 on the drive up here, and this house is less of a fixer-upper and more of a bulldoze-this-eyesore-and-start-over.¬†

But it‚Äôs also within their price range, and it‚Äôs on the historical register. Actually, it‚Äôs in their price range *because* it‚Äôs on the register. The county is willing to donate the home and the supplies needed to restore it, assuming Perry and Melissa are willing to do the manual labor to change this ruin back into the manor it once was. They are, and so the deal is going forward. They have been told that renovations must be completed by July 1st of next year; this gives them a year and three months. It‚Äôs a big job, but the realtor assures them that it‚Äôs completely doable. The young couple is responsible for the restoration and upkeep of the home - also, they had to sign a waiver. They are not allowed to sue the county if they get eaten. The manor has zombies.

The little Montana mansion was built in 1880 after the original homesteading family gave up on the land; It becomes apparent to Perry that the mansion‚Äôs hilltop placement was a strategic choice. The tree line sits a good two, in some places three hundred yards away from the building. Plenty of distance to spot an incoming horde of shambling undead and batten down the hatches. The original homesteaders, the Perkins family, had built their cabin in the shadow of the big ponderosas. Rookie mistake. The stone foundation of the cabin is still just barely visible if Perry uses his binoculars, which he was advised to bring by the local general store owner, and who also looked at Perry as if he had three heads when he said he bought the Perkins land.¬†

‚ÄúUse the binoculars,‚Äù the man had said. ‚ÄúSome of them zombies you can shoot, but some of them‚Äôs on the register too. Get a good clean ID before you pull the trigger. Ammo‚Äôs down aisle five.‚Äù

The patriarch of the Perkins clan, Cyril James Perkins, probably hadn‚Äôt intended to join the undead that infested his woods. He almost certainly didn‚Äôt know they were there; In the 1870s, westward expansion was the drive to build on this particular parcel. The reason to come back is the housing crisis. But between those two driving forces, nobody has been unfortunate enough or brave enough to call this place home, with the notable exception of the mansion‚Äôs original owner, and he skipped town a month after the manor‚Äôs completion. He wasn‚Äôt afraid of the undead. He had fled a far greater terror: unpaid creditors.

Today, Cyril is still ambling around the property. The guys from the department of corpse management were nice enough to come out and tag Cyril so that he‚Äôll be at least a little easier to manage. He‚Äôs the mostly skeletal one wearing a bright yellow DoCM safety vest. He‚Äôs on the register, so he stays, even if Perry gets a clean shot; Perry wonders idly who exactly is going to check and see if Cyril is still upright, but he also doesn‚Äôt feel like messing with government bureaucracy. He has a healthy fear of high interest rates, food poisoning, and the IRS, in that order. Desiccated walking corpses don‚Äôt even make it into the top ten.

‚ÄúOh look, there‚Äôs a little garden,‚Äù Melissa says. She‚Äôs looking at a patch of dirt demarcated from the surrounding scrub by a loose border of small boulders. ‚ÄúI wonder what grows well here.‚Äù

‚ÄúDirt seems to do pretty well,‚Äù gripes Perry. ‚ÄúYou could probably scare up some rattlesnakes too, if you really wanted to. Do they get zombie virus?‚Äù Perry is not a pessimist, though his friends might call him one. He frequently sees all of the things that could go wrong and then addresses them aggressively. He has a history of winning situations that most people would consider unworthy of even trying to beat. He is known for his refusal to take acetaminophen. He prefers to just complain about the aches and pains and have a beer. Melissa loves him dearly, but wishes he‚Äôd just take the obvious solution once in a while. Perry‚Äôs favorite adages are about work; according to him, there‚Äôs rarely time to do a job right, but never time to do it twice.

‚ÄúI bet I could get some blueberries to do alright out here,‚Äù Melissa continues. She knows better than to engage with Perry‚Äôs grumbling. ‚ÄúAnd if we get irrigation put in, I could grow corn. Maybe put in a chicken coop over there, and there you go, that‚Äôs everything you need for blueberry cornbread.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at us, huh? Homeowners.‚Äù

‚ÄúHomeowners,‚Äù She beams. She believes that this place will be where they can start a family and a legacy. She can already envision the homey plaque over the door: Welcome to the Wynne Family Homestead. The house can become their love letter to their future children. She can see them clearly in her imagination. She wants two, a boy and a girl.¬†

‚ÄúExcept zombies eat chickens, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù Perry frowns. ‚ÄúI guess I could put up a fence.‚Äù But even he isn‚Äôt immune to the optimism of the moment. ‚ÄúOh, hell. A fence isn‚Äôt so much work. Just let me get the roof patched first.‚Äù He smiles. Melissa sees, as she has so often lately, the man she fell in love with. He takes her hand and, together, they climb the steps up to the threshold of their very own fixer-upper.

\#

‚ÄúSweetheart, we‚Äôve got one over by the old homestead again,‚Äù Melissa calls out. She‚Äôs gotten the blueberry bushes in and she was right, they‚Äôre thriving. She is out pulling up scrub bushes to make way for further planting. Perry is inside rebuilding the wood floors in the eastern side of the manor. He keeps the windows open both for the fresh breezes that come rolling in off the windy, barren hill, but also so that he can keep an ear out for occasions such as this.¬†

He stands up from his work and walks to the window, picking up the beastly old rifle he keeps there. It‚Äôs an ancient Mauser, a bolt action behemoth with 1940 ANKARA K. KALE and a Turkish moon symbol stamped across the receiver; a military surplus gun with plentiful, reasonably cheap surplus ammunition. He found it at the general store for $150. He finds the zombie in question out near the tree line.

‚ÄúCover your ears, dear,‚Äù he calls down to his wife. She shouts back that she‚Äôs ready, and he pops on his own earmuffs and sights down the weapon. He steadies his breathing and gently squeezes the trigger. The Mauser barks, kicks back into his shoulder. The force rocked him back on his heels the first time he fired the gun, but he‚Äôs ready for it by now. His shoulder sports a splotchy purple bruise most days. The Mauser has a steel buttplate.

As he hears the gunshot echo back to him, reflected off of the wall of trees, he watches the zombie‚Äôs head turn to pulp and spray across the stone foundation; he makes a note to head out that way and hose that down before it has a chance to get baked onto the rocks in the sunshine.¬†

They have been living in and restoring the manor for three months now. Summer is in its zenith and the home, with its cutting-edge-for-1880 design, lacks air conditioning. Perry is irritable and yet optimistic; Melissa is sunshine itself, welcoming every morning with a happy little hummed tune as she retracts the heavy bars that reinforce the steel security doors. She has hung up a little hummingbird feeder, and against Perry‚Äôs assertion that there are no hummingbirds out here, it has become quite the hotspot. The glinting red glass does attract a zombie once, which Perry takes care of by giving it a good whomping with the butt of the Mauser. He is nearly bitten, and it is an excellent reminder to keep the gun loaded.

Cyril is a constant nuisance. His hi-vis vest was helpful at first, but fell off at some point and now adorns a sharp tree branch a hundred yards into the woods. As relatively safe as the scrub is, the forest itself is a deathtrap. Patient, motionless corpses can wait behind any tree, silent as death and only noticed once they lunge. Perry has watched deer be ambushed by the ancient residents of those woods, and even he is not belligerent enough to try and retrieve the yellow vest from its likely permanent home among the pines. For now, Cyril can be identified through binoculars.¬†

This fails to mitigate Cyril‚Äôs looming presence one bit. His empty eyeholes glow like dull embers late at night. He shows an animal cunning and will sometimes even knock on the door. Perry has grown deeply tired of his unwanted neighbor and uses a pool cleaning net to wrangle him back to the woods whenever possible.¬†

‚ÄúHi Cyril,‚Äù He says as he plops the long net around the ancient evil‚Äôs shoulders. ‚ÄúCan you go somewhere else, man? I‚Äôm trying to build equity here.‚Äù Cyril does not respond; he‚Äôs rude that way. Perry has nearly been bitten by Cyril twice, and once, Melissa doesn‚Äôt notice him until he is just on the other side of the clothesline, grasping at her through the clean linens. It ends alright, at least, with Cyril becoming too tangled in the bedsheet to see where he is going. As he ambles off toward the trees, a glaring Perry grips the Mauser tightly.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, sweetheart,‚Äù Melissa reassures him. He keeps his eyes locked firmly on Cyril.

‚ÄúPerry.‚Äù She says his name with authority. ‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

He nods and relaxes a bit. He knows she‚Äôs right. Destroying Cyril is grounds for the county to void their mortgage.

\#

Winter washes over the manor and puts the world into soft white stasis. Perry has time to go into the forest and get the yellow vest because the corpses are all frozen solid, but he finds that the vest is also frozen quite firmly in its new woody home. He leaves it there rather than spend too much time in the woods, which are plenty eerie even without the dead lurching after him. Cyril has become a wintertime statue in the garden, and Perry nails a sign to him. Melissa chastises him for profanity, and now the repainted sign says ‚ÄúI am a gigantic pain in the butt‚Äù instead.¬†

Their realtor makes a point of visiting Melissa and Perry that January, bringing a late albeit still appreciated housewarming gift. Brenda Thornton, as perpetually smiling as she is in her daytime TV commercials, turns up on the porch with a bottle of sherry and a voucher for a free oil change. It‚Äôs a savvy gift; Perry‚Äôs battered Subaru is on its last legs, and even an oil change is an expense the cash-strapped couple can hardly afford. Every dollar they have is tied up in this place.

‚ÄúHello, you two lovebirds!‚Äù She says this every time she sees them for reasons Perry cannot fathom. Brenda has the unenviable tendency to try and be their best friend, even though they barely know her, and the word that Melissa uses to describe the woman in private is saccharine. Perry uses several other words, many of which are four letters long.

‚ÄúI just thought I‚Äôd stop by,‚Äù Brenda says without losing a fraction of her smile, ‚Äúand see how things are going on the renovations. Can I bother you two for the tour?‚Äù Melissa warmly welcomes her in, and Perry does his best to not look grumpy. He even smiles, though it‚Äôs forced.¬†

He knows that this is not a social call.¬†

On top of the quite healthy and non-refundable fee they paid for Brenda‚Äôs services in the first place, their mortgage comes with a very specific schedule to renovate the manor. It needs to be done and ready for inspection by the coming July. Brenda is here to look for signs of contract breach, and the Wynnes have plenty of them to worry about. The wood they have been provided lately is warped and the insulation has been substandard, and despite Perry‚Äôs best efforts, they simply cannot be used. Shoddy insulation is only half of the reason for the chill that creeps into the air while they show Brenda the extensive updates.¬†

She holds her phone in front of her like a talisman, recording everything down to the minutest detail. The smile never budges, and in her haste to capture the litany of little problems, she still manages not to smudge her designer heels in the areas Perry has yet to finish.¬†

‚ÄúThe wood‚Äôs a little bit off,‚Äù Perry says as they review the results of Brenda‚Äôs inspection. They sit at the kitchen table, two mismatched thrift store glasses of sherry and a lemonade in front of them. Melissa does not drink alcohol; it gives her a ferocious hangover ever since she turned thirty. The lemonade cup gathers condensation. Nobody is touching their glasses.¬†

Brenda‚Äôs smile doesn‚Äôt leave her face, but it does take on a patronizing edge. Perry doesn‚Äôt relent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having trouble with the wood that‚Äôs getting dropped off,‚Äù He continues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the planks they‚Äôre giving us for the flooring. A lot of it‚Äôs twisted.‚Äù

Brenda is scrolling on her cell phone. ‚ÄúI noticed that.‚Äù She turns the phone to him. There is a photo of the east hallway. ‚ÄúSee that? That flooring is just all wrong. We‚Äôre going to have to do that whole hallway again. Let me talk to the lumberyard, I‚Äôll get it all sorted out.‚Äù She smiles.

The room thaws a little. Perry takes a tentative sip of his sherry; he‚Äôs a beer guy, but he certainly isn‚Äôt about to turn down a nice gift. He has been afraid to say more than a few words until now. He has been terrified that Brenda will tell him that faulty materials are hardly a valid reason to amend the contract and that they are out of luck. For the first time since Cyril froze solid beside the compost heap, The Wynnes have something to lighten their spirits. Perry and Melissa even find themselves enjoying the visit. Perry explains his strategy for keeping the zombies at the tree line. Melissa tells an amusing story about the garden. More drinks are poured, and the house glows with joy. They are not going to lose their house because of junk timber after all.¬†

The undead lurk outside, but for the first time in a long time, nobody in the Wynne house is afraid.¬†

\#

Springtime comes in lush and wet, drizzling much needed rain onto the parched scrubland. Thunderstorms rumble pleasantly over them, but the roof is repaired and they stay happily indoors, working by candlelight on thrift store puzzles that inevitably fail to contain all one thousand pieces. They welcome a new member to the family; Perry suggests they call him Mauser so that he will be strong and help protect the house. Melissa overrules him and names him Spark Plug. Spark Plug is a cat.

But even with progress, there is little sleep to be had in the Wynne household. Perry works on coffee and stubbornness; he feels the deadline approaching at a gallop. Melissa spends her days hanging wallpaper that exactly matches the manor‚Äôs original style. The entirety of the east rooms have been restored, and Perry‚Äôs handiwork shines. He was once a carpenter. It shows. Even Spark Plug gets into the spirit of things and stages a one-cat war on the mice in the basement. Melissa keeps a tally of his victories and is somewhat alarmed when the number keeps rising well past thirty. They have not had time to begin dealing with the rodent problem.

The trouble they come across feels bottomless. When Perry descends into the basement to lay mousetraps, flashlight in hand, he discovers that some of the ceiling beams are dangerously rotten. This was not discussed in the original agreement, but it certainly needs to be fixed. He does not own the proper equipment to lift heavy new beams into place, but he is a clever man and makes do with pulleys and rope. He pulls a muscle in his back, but will not rest; he just helps Melissa do some of the less strenuous work for a few days before returning to carpentry. There is no time to lose. The house is poised to reveal a new, unforeseen issue roughly every few days. When they discover an ancient, nearly mummified zombie in the locked attic, they lure it outside with Spark Plug‚Äôs mouse trophies before destroying it. There‚Äôs no reason to make an even bigger mess indoors.

Perry‚Äôs work never stops. He works until the day‚Äôs work is done, even when the day itself has long since given up the ghost and then he works by flashlight. He finds time, between blasting zombies and recreating century-old architecture, to make the sign that Melissa has dreamed about since the moment they saw the manor‚Äôs online listing. In firm, cerulean letters over a clean white background, it says ‚ÄúWelcome to the Wynne Family Homestead.‚Äù Like the manor itself, the sign‚Äôs woodwork is all Perry, and the paint is done with Melissa‚Äôs artistic flair. A painted green vine rolls along the border of the sign, popping blooming blue flowers onto the white background. Someday, Melissa promises, the front of the manor will have morning glories that match the ones she‚Äôs painted on the sign. It‚Äôs a small victory, but a significant one. The place feels more like home than ever.

But despite these small, successful battles, they cannot help but feel they are losing the broader war. Their original repair plans have been amended and added onto so many times that they only vaguely resemble the job they set out to do; the discovery of rotten beams, crumbling masonry, and rodent colonies has revealed their initial appraisal to be so much wishful thinking. If the house hadn‚Äôt so successfully hidden its deeper cancers, they may have never taken on the project at all; as it is, they have two more months to complete a list that seems as foully undying as their shambling neighbors. Perry assures his wife that they will make the cutoff. He is one to roll the dice even when the odds are against him, to play the entire hand of cards before he admits defeat. But Melissa has caught him up late at night, pacing the renovated kitchen with a beer in one hand and a to-do list in the other, now and then taking a heavy sigh. He puts on a brave face for her, as he always does, and she doesn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him that she knows it‚Äôs just an act. Still, they press on. The Wynnes do not know what it is to fight from an advantageous position. They never have. For them, this is just one more uphill expedition, and they have every intention of making it to the top.

\#

The deadline arrives before the last of the lumber. Instead of holding a housewarming, the Wynnes are packing the same cardboard boxes they arrived with. They haven‚Äôt made the deadline. The coughing and spluttering Subaru chugs down the rough dirt road away from the manor. The interior of the car is silent except for the tires chewing away at gravel and bumping through the occasional pothole. Perry doesn‚Äôt speak. He doesn‚Äôt know what to say. Melissa doesn‚Äôt either, but she tries anyway.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe we can appeal to someone,‚Äù she offers. ‚ÄúThe manor isn‚Äôt going anywhere, and maybe if there are no buyers‚Ä¶‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt finish the thought. She and Perry have already had this discussion with Brenda, who explained that their deadline was simply up the same way she might explain Chutes and Ladders to an unhappy child. Sorry, that‚Äôs just the way the game goes. Back to square one for you! She didn‚Äôt even stop filling out the paperwork canceling their contract, her monogrammed pen flicking this way and that, the hefty packet of papers resting on their scuffed and thrifted card table. Couldn‚Äôt they have an extension? Considering the state of advanced disrepair the house had been in, weren‚Äôt they entitled to another thirty days or so? Melissa pointed to the jar of spent Mauser cartridges on the windowsill; forty seven zombies dispatched, plus the one Perry clubbed on the front porch. Wasn‚Äôt *that* worth a little more time?¬†

Brenda‚Äôs plastic smile never budged. Rules are rules, she told them, and slid the heap of papers across the table to them. Sign here and here, please, then get the hell out of the house that is no longer yours. Buh-bye.

The house practically shines. Melissa had finished painting the outside of the rambling structure just the day before Brenda came to take it away, the former wreck atop the hill now a cheery periwinkle blue. All that is left to fix is the attic, and even that is a minor job. Another month at most, assuming they don‚Äôt discover silverfish or warped beams or a portal to hell. Even the portal could probably be dealt with given some extra plywood, but then, Perry reasons, Brenda would lose her shortcut into the place.

The reality of the situation, Perry suspects, is that Brenda knew the job was too big for just a year and a half. Sign up a couple of broke and too-ambitious people to flip the place, then drop the hammer on them when it isn‚Äôt done in the allotted time. They get nothing at all if they fail to complete the renovations, not even payment for their work. As soon as the papers were reluctantly signed, Brenda practically skipped through the house removing any personal effects. Melissa held her breath when the peppy realtor flagged them down on the way out; Perry stopped the Subaru and hand-cranked down the window. Perhaps she would show some mercy, or have some sort of deal they could strike ‚Äì but no, she was merely handing them the sign from the front door with a phony look of sympathy. As they reached the end of the gravel driveway and lost sight of the house, Melissa did her best to sniffle back tears. They are ten minutes from the house when Melissa speaks up again.

‚ÄúPerry!‚Äù she shouts, startling them both; she is much louder in the cramped little car than she means to be. Perry stomps the brakes. ‚ÄúPerry, Spark Plug!‚Äù

Of course, Spark Plug had skittered to one of his many hiding spots the moment Brenda knocked on the door. He has lived outside with the zombies for years and he knows evil when he sees it. Currently, he is sitting in the East upper bedroom‚Äôs window, where the Mauser he was nearly named after had rested. He is watching a shamelessly gleeful Brenda busying herself with initial changes to the manor; she intends to have this place back on the market within the week. She may even purchase it herself. Any of the Wynnes‚Äô personal effects have to go, though their updates to the house can stay. Only the garden escapes her scrutiny. A woman wearing $600 heels isn‚Äôt about to go tromping around between corn stalks. Spark Plug watches her adjust things here and there, picking up the shovel Melissa has left leaning against the house and moving the lawn sprinkler that Perry has been using to entice the lawn into some shade resembling green. Then her eyes swing across the tree line, and she spots a garish splotch of fluorescent yellow.

The ruckus is nearly over by the time Melissa has bundled Spark Plug into her arms and is ready to leave the fixer-upper forever. Far down the hill, the forest is in an uproar. The tree line swims with shadowy movement, and Brenda‚Äôs wild shrieks carry easily in the still summer air. Melissa spies snippets of her stylish blouse through the trees; it looks like she‚Äôs carrying Cyril‚Äôs lost safety vest in one long-nailed hand. Perry charges up the staircase with his rifle, working the bolt and preparing to fire. In winter, the angle from the window gives the best view of the tree line. But In the height of summer the trees hide far too much for him to identify any good target. Even if he has a shot, what can he do? Brenda has wandered into a hornet‚Äôs nest. She‚Äôs going to get stung.¬†

By the time Perry finally spots a zombie wandering out of the tree line, he knows Brenda is bitten, if not devoured outright. Besides, the corpse he spots is Cyril. He is gnawing absentmindedly on a designer high heeled shoe.¬†

\#

The realtor assigned to the manor after Brenda‚Äôs devouring is a much more lenient woman. She inspects the old house and is pleased at how much the Wynnes have achieved already; she happily files an extension on their contract, gives Spark Plug a hearty scritch behind his ears, and congratulates the Wynnes on their new home. With a flair for the dramatic, she even recommends that the Wynnes put Cyril into a settler costume and start an Instagram for him; Perry declines.¬†

Even without the Instagram fame, Perry and Cyril‚Äôs relationship grows. When Cyril knocks on the door early in the morning, Perry pretends to be annoyed about it and then takes the ancient frontiersman for a walk anyhow. Now and then he will buy a pair of ladies‚Äô pumps at the thrift store and throw them for Cyril. This turns out to be a sound investment. With Cyril‚Äôs three remaining teeth, he can happily gnaw on a pair of shoes for a month before he needs another. Between his preoccupation with eating footwear and the bell Perry manages to hang around his neck, Cyril‚Äôs presence becomes almost pleasant.

The Wynnes find themselves in a situation they have never before enjoyed: For one shining season, they are actually out of work to do on the house. Once winter rolls through and the cold batters the woodwork, they know they‚Äôll once again find themselves fighting a battle of constant maintenance. But for now, they can rest on the balcony and watch the sunset. Perry‚Äôs gun rests against the windowsill of the East bedroom and gathers dust.¬†",2,1759079280.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

1nstmmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPOinPH/comments/1nstmmo/my_adp_kickstart_hiring_experience/,My ADP KICKSTART HIRING EXPERIENCE‚ú®,"Share ko lang yung experience ko sa ADP Kickstart Hiring Experience last 09/19/25 (Friday).

Dumating ako sa site around 7:55, since 8am naman ang call time. Naging mabilis ang pagpasok ko since may referral ako from ADP employee and nakapagcreate na ako ng profile online before ako pumunta.

Number 10 yung nakuha kong number and pagdating ko sa lobby nila hindi pa gaanong madami ang tao. May mga HR/TA sa unahan around 3-5 ang nagpaprocess for screening ng applicants. Almost 9am na nagstart yung pagtawag sa numbers.

Sa screening, inask ako kung gusto ko ba sa same BU ng nagrefer sa akin which is from NAS. That time hindi ko talaga alam kung ano gusto ko since hindi ko talaga personally alam 'tong si ADP. Literal na napadaan lang sa feed ko then nag-apply ako and research na ng reviews sa company. Kaya ang sagot ko sa TA eh hindi ko sure kung saan ako pwede. Sobrang friendly and approachable ng TA, tumango lang sya then nagsmile saken sabay tanong kung may tech exp/background ako. I answered, ""Yes, almost 2 years."" And then ayun fill up ng form then binigyan ako ng meal stub for free lunch which is Jollibee Meal - rice and chicken, peach mango pie and coke mismo. May pafree snacks and and coffee rin pala.

Hindi ko alam kung anong BU and role ako nilagay, pero naghintay nalang rin ako matawag for interview.

Nashookt ako nung tinawag ako at inexplain ng hiring manager na panel interview ang magaganap. Dalawa silang hiring manager, very approachable and professional rin. The interview lasted for almost an hour. Chill pero mahaba. Talagang yung mga questions nila is para kilalanin ka and maintindihan nila yung mga previous role mo and malaman kung anong long term goal mo sa ADP. At the end of the interview, nagsabi ang HM sa akin na baka magkaroon ako ng 2nd interview but it depends sa deliberation nila.

Balik uli ako sa waiting area. Hindi umabot ng 10 mins nung tinawag ako nung HM and inexplain na I will have a 2nd interview with onshore (virtually). Hindi ko alam kung matutuwa ako or what kasi pakiramdam ko bumagsak ako sa initial interview and yung 2nd interview is para mareprofile ako and maredeem ko yung sarili ko. Hindi ko alam ang mararamdaman ko. Going back kay HM, nagbigay sya ng copy ng work emails nila if ever hindi ako makareceive ng invite eh manotify ko sila. Pinabalik nya uli ako sa waiting area.

Few moments after, tinawag ako ng HR. Inexplain nya lang uli yung process about sa 2nd interview. That time hindi ko pa rin alam kung anong role ko, so I kindly asked her. She's very friendly and helpful, and then sinabi nyang it's a NEW/PIONEER ACCOUNT. Pinaprocess ko palang yung sinabi nya that time nung nagsalita uli sya ""Half congrats!"". I personally don't know what to feel that time but I smiled and thanked her. She even reminded me  to take my lunch first before umuwi. Around 11:30ish na yun, kinuha ko lang yung lunch ko and kumain. Nakaalis ako ng site around 12pm. Ganon kabilis yung naging process ng pag-apply ko sa ADP.

Fast forward >>>> 2nd interview (Monday)

Panel interview uli. With PH and US Hiring Managers. The interview lasted more than 1 hour, more on behavioral and situational questions ang mga tanong. Kind and professional silang lahat. And halos same ng initial interview ko before, nafeel ko na talagang gusto ka nilang kilalanin and intindihin yung previous role mo.

The next day, around hapon nung nakareceived ako ng invite for Application Status. Hindi pa rin klaro kung hired na ba ako o ano, kasi nagdiscuss lang kami about salary, benefits etc. Nakipagnegotiate pa ako sa salary kaya back to waiting game uli. I'm happy naman na mabilis yung action nila, kinagabihan may update agad and nagkaroon uli ng meeting for JO discussion.

Hindi ganon katempting yung salary since nagrirange sya 27-35k, pero based sa mga nabasa kong reviews kay ADP maganda syang company kaya I accepted the offer. My start date will be next month and I'm excited since new account sya.

Consultant pala yung role ko. I'm not sure if pwede idisclose here yung complete job title.

Overall, mabilis at maayos yung naging experience ko kay ADP during KickStart Hiring.‚ú®",2,1759079217.0,BPOinPH,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm in my final year of college and just got out of relationship with my then bf  But there‚Äôs this confusing layer involving his best friend.

Back in first year, I almost asked this guy (my bf‚Äôs best friend) out for coffee. I chickened out at the last second and said I was going alone instead. Since then, we never really became close, but there‚Äôs always been‚Ä¶ something? Also when he came to knew that his best friend (my ex) liked me he eventuallyltalked less to me and because of that my feelings faded away too and ended up dating my ex. But now in my final year my feelings have been rekindled some context about him

He‚Äôs a private guy, doesn‚Äôt spend one-on-one time with anyone, and never directly flirts. But around me, he‚Äôll:

Tease me a lot in class (like mocking my presentation even though he never asks questions otherwise).

Sometimes announce things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm single‚Äù in a group setting.

Occasionally try to start flimsy conversations when we‚Äôre sitting next to each other.

Laugh at random things just because I‚Äôm laughing (like, no reason at all ).

Once even invited me to a competition (hackathon back in first year) was performing in,also used to send me info about robotics workshop happening anywhere as he knew I liked robotics. 

(now in fourth year) , he also doesn‚Äôt make any effort to spend time with me, and sometimes seems to go out of his way to keep things ‚Äúgroup-only‚Äù (like if I ask to talk alone, he‚Äôll bring others along).

So now Im thinking to maybe write a a letter to him confessing my crush and give it to him at end of semester? Will not wait for a positive responsetbut underneath I really do wanna pursue him.

After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself‚Äîsexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let‚Äôs skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don‚Äôt want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let‚Äôs channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I‚Äôm here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we‚Äôre debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You‚Äôre a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you‚Äôve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I‚Äôll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

\*\*The Vibe:\*\*Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I‚Äôm driven but not ruthless, my version of ‚ÄúMachiavellian‚Äù is designing a life that‚Äôs sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let‚Äôs be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

I can have normal conversations with girls but when it comes to actually flirting, I either come across as trying too hard or I'm so subtle that nothing happens.

Like last week I was talking to this girl at a coffee shop and we were laughing and having a good time. But I had no idea how to shift from friendly conversation to actual flirting without making it weird. Ended up just getting her Instagram and never messaging her.

I see other guys who seem to naturally know how to be charming and playful, but when I try the same stuff it feels forced. Is there a difference between flirting with girls you just met vs girls you already know? 

What actually works? Are there specific things you say or do? How do you know if she's receptive vs just being polite?

I don't want to be that guy who misreads signals and makes women uncomfortable, but I also don't want to keep missing opportunities because I'm too scared to make a move.

Any tips from guys who figured this out?",34,1759078847.0,AskMen,26,0.88,False

Hope you guys find it useful. We came to Kathmandu on 03.09 and our return flight was 17.09, so exactly two weeks in Nepal. We knew the timeframe was tight, but decided to give it a go.¬†

**Transportation**

Download the InDrive app and register; it works like Uber and is the best way to get around Kathmandu. Keep in mind you must pay the driver in cash after the ride.

As for EBC, Jeep was our go-to option as we wanted to save money. But it is also more sturdy, as the flights are highly unreliable at this time of year. When finishing EBC, there were no flights for 3 days, and then for at least another 2 days after. So people were stuck for at least 5 days; I have no idea when the flights were resumed. The Jeep journey takes 2 full days, but unless there is a massive problem with the road, you will most likely arrive as planned.¬†

Jeep

Most important! Unless you are a very small and thin person, and really want to save some money, I highly recommend you buy an extra seat. By default, they seat 4 people in one row (same width as the back row of an average 5-seater city car). So when you travel in 2ppl, buy 3 seats; for 3ppl buy 4 seats. Ask for this when you buy tickets or when arranging the ride; it makes a HUGE difference in comfort.¬†

When you arrive at your hotel in Kathmandu, ask the front desk for a jeep to Salleri. Online, you can read about a highway being constructed, but I think it is not true. The road to Salleri was flooded a few months ago, and is an asphalt and dirt road. They told us it takes 8-9 hours to reach Salleri, but in reality, it was \~13 hours both times. Departure is around 5 AM. There are stops for food, so no need to bring your own. You will arrive in Surke around 6 PM, and the driver should drop you at his friend‚Äôs guesthouse, but you can request to be dropped off at a different one. The normal price for this ride is 2000 NPR, but our Kathmandu hotel charged 3000 NPR with hotel pickup. You need to sleep in Salleri and the next day take another 4x4 jeep to Surke, where you can start your trek.¬†

The driver from Kathmandu should ask you if you need transport to Surke for the next day, and the same with the guesthouse owner. I think it doesn‚Äôt matter which one you choose. The normal price is 3000 NPR for the Surke jeep. At the beginning, we were told this journey was 4-5 hours, but ended up being \~11 hours. You start around 7 AM and arrive at Surke at dusk. Sleep in Surke and start your trek the next day.¬†

Keep in mind, the road to Surke is a real off-road; it was destroyed by the river, and we had to literally jump with backpacks on the remains of some pipes to the other side of the road and swap jeeps. It was a big river, so honestly, it was dangerous. Then our driver refused to drive further (many other jeeps passed us later), and we had to walk 3 hours to Surke at night in heavy rain. Coming back after finishing EBC, there were two human-sized rocks in the middle of the road; fortunately, the drivers were able to put them aside with hydraulic car lifters. So I guess if you are afraid of the flight being dangerous, jeep is not the best alternative.¬†

For larger groups:

The first jeep has 9 seats (1 front seat and two rows of 4 seats). Realistically, if you want to sit semi-comfortably, it can fit 7 ppl.

The second jeep has 6 seats (2 front and 4 back). In reality, it can fit 1 person in front and 3 in the back, so 4 in total.

Flight

You can fly to Lukla from Kathmandu (or more likely from Manthali, a few hours' drive away). The price is fixed at 222/225 USD for all airlines. In the off-season, you can buy the tickets on departure day.

**Weather**¬†

We read online that the monsoon should be ending at this time, but unfortunately, it started a bit later than usual and thus lasted for our whole trip. All in all, the weather was not a disaster, but it was getting worse instead of better. At the beginning, there was sun and we saw some 8k peaks, later there was usually fog and clouds. Even if the sky above you cleared, the peaks were covered with clouds and not visible at all. Except for the first day, there was no heavy rain between 8/9 AM and 1/2 PM, but every other day there was some light rain. I believe this is a price you have to consider paying for having very few people on the trail.¬†

**Money**¬†

You definitely need to bring enough cash to the trail, many hotels had stickers ‚Äúcards accepted‚Äù but I asked 3 of them and all said there are some problems and accept only cash. I was used to withdrawing money from ATMs with a Revolut card, but in Kathmandu, all ATMs have an access fee of 500 NPR, and you can withdraw a maximum 25 000 NPR (some have a higher limit, but the access fee is also higher). So I guess it is better to take USD and exchange it in Kathmandu. We took out 125,000 NPR for two ppl, and carried an extra 100 USD each just in case. We also needed 30 USD for a visa on arrival.

We paid by card for two dinners and our 1st night in Kathmandu, the rest was cash.

62,000 NPR per person was enough for transport, accommodation, food, souvenirs, permits, and a SIM card.¬†

It was one of our most affordable trips, 420 euros per person for two weeks. We got a good deal on flights from Vienna for 430 euros both ways, so the total cost, including a 30 USD visa and 100 euro insurance, was less than 1000 euros.

During the trek, we spend from 2200 to 3750 NPR per person per day; the higher you go, the more expensive it gets. This includes accommodation, breakfast, dinner, tea pots, and some hot showers. Keep in mind, after Dingboche we didn‚Äôt take hot showers, didn‚Äôt buy phone charges, nor wifi‚Äôs. Two 20k power banks were enough to charge the camera, watch, and two phones. If you want to take a shower in Lobuche, it will be around 1000 NPR, same with wifi.¬†

**People**¬†

Nepalese are the kindest people on earth, always ready to help you. Complete opposite of what we experienced in India. There were no scammers (except one taxi driver in Kathmandu who tried to convince us he was our InDrive), and you could really see that these people have your best interest at heart. We were never pushed to buy or pay extra for anything; at every lodge, they wrote down all our expenses and let us check before paying. We had soaked clothes, a lovely host couple fired a coal heater, and dried our jackets with us. If you have any problem, you can always ask, and if possible, they will help you. In Nepal, we felt more welcome than anywhere else in the world.

**Food/water**

During the trek, there is no problem with food; it is tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced. We stuck to vegetarian food as a safer option for the stomach. The best value is Dal Bhat, which is unlimited to a reasonable extent. I can eat huge portions and am always full after ordering Dal Bhat. It is also the most balanced, as you have carbohydrates from rice, proteins from dal, and vitamins+iron from spinach.

From Europe, we took 1kg of peanut butter as it is very calorie-dense, a lot of good fats, and some proteins. It was a good addition to the morning porridge. Electrolytes and powdered isotonic drinks also came in handy as we drank \~5 liters of water daily. We had two dehydrated spaghetti meals from Decathlon in case of stomach problems (ate in Gorak), some gummy bears, and cereal bars.¬†

We filtered water from a soft flask into a Nalgene, and it worked great, very efficient, and lightweight. There are many taps outside along the way. If you fill your Nalgene, you should have enough water to find the next one. In Gorak, it is advised to drink boiled or bottled water, as there is only glacier water available. This was the only time we bought water.

**Guides/Porters**¬†

If you just want to do EBC and Kala Patthar, there is no reason to get a guide. The road was super simple; if there are no signs, just choose the biggest path. Download the [Mapy.com](http://Mapy.com) app, sign up for free, download offline Nepal maps, and you're good to go.

As for porters, it might make sense to hire one if you have some doubts about your fitness, but if you can pack light, you should be good on your own.

We went solo, and it was a great decision. The only time we hesitated was right before base camp. There was a melting glacier, and the path was falling down the slope. We needed to walk on rocks, and some were quite unstable, so returning, we waited for the Chinese girls with the guide to pass us and walked after them.¬†

**Equipment**¬†

We divided the equipment according to our own weight. My backpack with full food, shoes, and jackets was around 15kg, and my gf was 10kg. Closer to the top, we wore heavier clothes and ate the food, so my bag was \~10kg and my gf was \~7kg. The sleeping bags we used were only once, and honestly, they were not necessary. In the off-season, they have many empty rooms and can give you a second duvet. I read many times that high sturdy shoes are a must. I chose my trail running shoes (250g both) over the Lowa explorer (1200g both), and it was a great choice. In the conditions we were trekking in, there was zero need to bring heavy shoes. I also didn‚Äôt take microspikes as there was no snow anywhere on the trail.

Stuff for trekking:

* 1 main backpack (60+10L for me and 45+10L for my gf)
* 1 down sleeping bag, 0 degrees Celsius comfort¬†
* 1 Merrell Moab Low GTX shoes
* 1 evadict trail running shoes¬†
* 1 flip flops
* 1 hiking poles
* 1 Gore-Tex jacket
* 1 insulted jacket
* 1 waterproof pants
* 1 insulted pants
* 2 long-sleeve merino termo
* 1 termo underpants¬†
* 4 boxers¬†
* 5 pairs of socks¬†
* headlight¬†
* Merino beanie, gloves, and neck warmer
* sunglasses, sunscreen
* 1L wide Nalgene bottle
* Simond soft flask water filter
* plastic spoon

**Itinerary and accommodation**¬†

Day 1¬†

Arrive in Kathmandu, withdraw or exchange NPR, arrange a jeep, and check out the biggest attractions

Day 2¬†

Kathmandu -> Salleri

\~13-hour drive by jeep

Slept in Numbur guesthouse, I recommend staying here, they have new rooms with private bathroom and hot shower - later there won‚Äôt be such luxuries. We paid 1000 NPR for a room.

Day 3

Salleri -> Surke

\~11-hour drive by 4x4

Namaste Lodge was recommended twice by local people along the way, but it was closed at the time.

Day 4

Surke -> Namche

Because the drive from Salleri to Surke took a whole day, we needed to catch up to the plan and decided to go straight to Namche, as the altitude is not a problem. If you are reasonably fit without a heavy backpack, you will make it work. We started at 8 AM and reached Namche 10 hours later. Stayed in Alpine lodge, it was fine but nothing special. It was the last place with free WIFI and charging, the shower was 500NPR. The room was free if you ordered food.

Day 5

Aclimatisation day

Short hike to Khunde and Hotel Everest View

Day 6

Namche -> Tengboche

After 2/3 of the way, you will face a steep ascent. We stayed in the Himalayan Hotel, and the food was good but a little pricy. Accommodation was below average. You can pay for a hot shower; cold water is free.

Day 7

Tengboche -> Dingboche

On this day, you will see a landscape changing; there will be more rocks and less forest. We had the best stay here in Green Tara Lodge. My Google Maps review: ""This was the best place we stayed during the EBC trek, and considering the altitude, it is amazing how good you feel in here. Prices are very affordable (cheaper than in Tengboche) and the food was the best we had on the whole trek (delicious momos, same for dal bhat). Instead of many business hotels you see on the trail, the Green Tara host is the kindest person. We were greeted with hot tea/coffee and had the cleanest room during the trek with a private squat toilet. There is also a hot shower in a nice glass cabin for a very reasonable price. From the room, you exit directly to the green patio with a mountain view instead of smelly and dark hotel halls. Very authentic place with a wonderful owner. Highly recommend, you won‚Äôt find a better place in Dingboche.""

Day 8

Dingboche -> Lobuche

Unfortunately, we had no choice but to skip the second acclimatisation day. We felt very well at Dingboche and decided to push on; it was a good decision, although in Lobuche we felt the altitude for the first time. I suppose the extra day in Dingboche would prevent that, so I highly recommend you do this. Stayed in Hotel Peak 15, it was nice, but we knew the host from the Jeep drive and got the best room plus freebies; others might not get such good treatment.

Day 9

Lobuche -> Gorak Shep -> EBC -> Gorak

This day was harder than expected; I had some fatigue and a light headache when returning from EBC. I believe it was half altitude and half tiredness, as the path from Gorak to EBC took us much longer than we expected. Highly recommend you go up to the tents, and the rock is not very impressive. There might be no visible path, so look for Yak shit and follow it. In Gorak, we slept at Buddha Lodge. It was fine considering the altitude.

Day 10

Gorak -> Dingboche

Day 11

Dingboche -> Namche

Day 12

Namche -> Surke

Day 13

Surke -> Salleri by 4x4

Day 14

Salleri -> Kathmandu by Jeep

Day 15

I‚Äôm a 42 year old woman.  Up until last week I thought was a relatively healthy.  Then, on Friday I started to have what I thought was an ear infection.  There was pain in my ear and neck simulator earaches I‚Äôve had before.  I am a teacher and we have young children in our family and as a child I had tubes etc. in my ears, so it‚Äôs pretty common.  Then, on Saturday, I was going up some stairs and got winded and felt very tired.  I assumed it was because it had been a long week.  Then, around dinner time I began vomiting.  My husband took me to urgent care where I was told to immediately go to the ER.  Turns out, it was an unexpected heart attack.  I was hospitalized from Saturday night until Friday afternoon and had a stent put in.

The recovery so far has been smooth physically.  I‚Äôve never smoked, only drink occasionally/socially, get between 5-7,000 steps per day on average and ate pretty healthily.  I‚Äôm overweight but not obese.  I did enjoy snacks and sweets though.  And caffeine got me through the day.  My mom passed away from a heart condition when she was 53.  

However, despite all of that, I can‚Äôt shake this guilty feeling that I caused all of this.  That‚Äôs it‚Äôs my fault.  I have terrible thoughts about myself like ‚Äúif your fat ass hadn‚Äôt had 2 pieces of cake at the birthday party, you‚Äôd be ok‚Äù or ‚Äúif you‚Äôd drank less coffee this wouldn‚Äôt have happened‚Äù.  I‚Äôm feeling a lot of guilt and shame.

The other aspect I‚Äôm struggling with is sitting and resting.  I‚Äôm used to being constantly on the go, taking care of others, not them taking care of me.  I‚Äôm the one others depend on not the one dependent on others.  I know some of it stems from my childhood (basically in my house as a kid, your worth was determined by your performance/usefulness). 

Still though, the mental stuff is the hardest part of recovery for me.  Any tips from those that have been there?",2,1759078336.0,HeartAttack,5,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs call my partner Lars. Brother (let‚Äôs call him Andy) is a stressy, volatile kind of a person who has refused anger management and therapy despite his family encouraging it. Lars is quiet, calm person who has had a therapist for years. Andy is larger, and physically intimidating compared Lars. Andy‚Äôs like 6 foot one- I‚Äôd guess 220 pounds, and Lars has a more slight build at 5 foot eight, 140 pounds. 

Andy has a typical corporate job, whereas Lars and I are self-employed professional artists with a somewhat ‚Äúglamorous life on paper‚Äù - any professional artists here will know what I mean. Andy has two young children and a wife who also has a corporate job. It was not Andy‚Äôs dream to have kids, more something he knew he had to do to keep his wife. He is a frustrated writer and had expressed jealousy of Lars‚Äôs profession in the arts. So part of his blowback toward us seems to be his jealousy and frustration. We work late, often into the wee hours. Being professional musicians is essentially shift work, going on stage late at night or having to drive long distances after shows. Andy makes a point of being loud and waking my partner up early when he can. 

Andy erupted at me once in the context of a board game and I decided I‚Äôm never playing a game with him again. We were teaching Andy this really fun game, and he decided I‚Äôd made an unfair move, all evidence aside. I‚Äôm not here to be his target. I didn‚Äôt have a conversation about it with him. I just backed off. He freaked out in his own home, and I wasn‚Äôt going to chide him there or anywhere really. I had only met him a couple times at that point. 

Next incident: Andy blew up at Lars at their father‚Äôs funeral. He literally said ‚Äúmy dad just died‚Äù as if it wasn‚Äôt Lars‚Äôs father‚Äôs funeral too. Andy had been shushing people around the back of the house, where his son was taking a nap. The walls of the house were two feet thick though, and Lars pointed that out. You can‚Äôt hear anything through those walls. Andy went on to apologize to Lars multiple times that day. 

Then on Lars‚Äôs birthday Andy went out of his way to be rude to me. Lars said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on speaker phone with OP‚Äù and Andy said hello to my dog and not me. In that moment I saw how far gone he is, that he is using me as a target for plausible deniability as a way to punch his brother. I decided in that moment to never stay with Andy again (he has a big house and often offers his spot when we travel to see the family.) Lars was really bummed out after his brother snubbed me on his birthday. 

I don‚Äôt want to intrude on what‚Äôs a personal problem between my partner and his brother. I also don‚Äôt want to be a target. So I‚Äôve just removed myself in as much as possible. 

Andy has this super odd, rigid communication style with me where he only talks to me about coffee (which I don‚Äôt care about) and if I try to have a normal conversation he does not respond. I think he‚Äôs only slightly less rigid in his conversation style with Lars. 

I have a very lovely relationship with their mother. Andy is snippy with his wife as well as his mother and brother- he boils over at everyone on a regular basis. 

Recent incident: Lars visited Andy while he was traveling for work and saw the name of our city on the calendar. Andy revealed he was visiting our city but hadn‚Äôt planned on telling us. Lars was bummed Andy wasn‚Äôt trying to see him. 

Most recent incident: tonight Andy did it again, not saying hello to me in a speaker phone call. I don‚Äôt want to insert myself if he doesn‚Äôt want to say hello so I didn‚Äôt speak. 

Does anyone have any advice about how I can support my partner in dealing with his brother? 

I plan on staying formal and distant as possible if Andy‚Äôs poor behavior continues. I will avoid staying at Andy‚Äôs house in the future. We want to maintain as close and positive a relationship as possible in order to be there as uncle/aunt figures to the niblings. Lars and his mother make it clear to Andy‚Äôs wife that we see his behavior and they‚Äôre here to support her. All of them try to encourage Andy to get therapy and or do anger management and he does not want to go. 

When Andy first met me, he was only father of one, maybe a little less stressed, and he was more pleasant. I think he‚Äôs an interesting person, and I give him the benefit of the doubt that he is more than his coping mechanisms, better than his worst behavior. But I refuse to be a punching bag to him, so I‚Äôll back off as much as possible. 

Any constructive advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",1,1759078240.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

The stim load, the natural sweeteners, and the flavor lineup make it very different from most mainstream tubs.

If you are thinking about running it daily, here are a few things worth knowing first.

# 1. Caffeine is higher than you think

One serving is already in the ‚Äúhigh stim‚Äù range.

But if you are sensitive, stacking it with coffee or an energy drink can push you over the edge fast.

Treat it like the main caffeine source of your day, not just another scoop.

# 2. Hydration matters more

High stims can mask dehydration.

If you train hard on Bulk Black without enough water, you will feel flat instead of focused.

I found 20 to 24 ounces of water per scoop is the sweet spot.

# 3. Flavors can make or break consistency

Even the strongest pre workout is useless if you stop drinking it.

Bulk Black is naturally sweetened, which avoids the fake candy taste most brands use.

That makes flavor choice way more important, because some are refreshing, while others are harsh.

Full breakdown of all 9 flavors is here: [Bulk Black flavor ranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/suppsavings/comments/1nsna9a/i_tried_all_9_bulk_black_flavors_a_couple_slapped/).

# 4. It hits differently than regular Bulk

Bulk Black is heavier on stimulants, lighter on pump ingredients.

It feels sharper, more intense, but less ‚Äúfull‚Äù in the gym.

If you like dialed in focus over blood flow, it is a good fit.

If you chase pumps, you may want to pair it with a stim-free pump formula.

# Honest takeaway

Bulk Black is for people who want intensity and focus without artificial sweeteners.

But it is not plug and play for everyone.

Dial in your water, watch your caffeine intake, and pick the right flavor if you want it to stay in your rotation.",1,1759077872.0,suppsavings,0,1.0,False
1nst1l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nst1l7/reveal_the_best_soda_maker_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Soda Maker Experience with SodaStream Terra,"Using the SodaStream Terra SSM1087 for the past month has been a fizzy revelation, quite literally. As someone who loves having sparkling water on tap, this little machine fits perfectly into my kitchen routine. Its streamlined design and ease of use make it a delight, but let's not kid ourselves‚Äîno device is flawless. There's much to praise about this sparkling water maker, but there are also a few quirks worth noting. Let me break it down for you.

**Sleek Design and Compact Build**  
The SodaStream Terra stands out on my kitchen counter without screaming for attention, and at just 2.2 pounds, this thing is lightweight and easy to move around. Its manual operation means no dependence on batteries or power outlets, which makes it even more convenient. I love how the black finish blends seamlessly with modern kitchen aesthetics. Measuring approximately 1.1 x 9.7 x 6.5 inches, it fits snugly even in smaller setups. My cousin, who lives in a compact apartment, recently visited and remarked how perfectly it would fit in her limited counter space. However, if you're someone who has a penchant for ultra-luxury finishes, you might find the plastic construction lacking that ""premium"" feel.

**Easy Setup and Quick Connect Tech**  
Right out of the box, the SodaStream Terra comes with everything you need, including a 60-liter gas cylinder and a reusable BPA-free, dishwasher-safe bottle. Snapping the gas cylinder into place with the Quick Connect technology couldn‚Äôt have been quicker or easier. I didn't even need to consult the manual; it‚Äôs that intuitive. The snap-lock mechanism for the bottle is undoubtedly one of the highlights for me. A single push motion holds the bottle securely in place without unnecessary fiddling. However, in fairness, I did notice that the oxide cylinder installation might require a bit of a learning curve for first-time users. My coworker tried it and ended up fumbling a bit, initially thinking it hadn‚Äôt latched correctly.

**Stress-Free Performance and Versatility**  
This machine turns flat tap water into fizzy bliss in seconds. There‚Äôs something satisfying about customizing the sparkle level with the press of the carbonating button. It‚Äôs a tactile experience, much like grinding your coffee beans fresh each morning. Beyond just sparkling water, the Terra opens up possibilities for mocktails, cocktails, and soft drink experimentation. My nephew loves whipping up soda creations using flavored syrups, though I keep reminding him not to overdo it with the sugar. However, keep in mind that it operates entirely manually. While this might appeal to purists, some people might prefer models that allow for more automation or exact carbonation level presets.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and stylish design fits in any kitchen seamlessly  
- Quick Connect technology simplifies cylinder installation  
- Manual operation keeps things eco-friendly  
- Dishwasher-safe, BPA-free carbonating bottle  
- Sustainable‚Äîreduces single-use plastic waste drastically  

[Check SodaStream Terra SSM1087 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b09h3627rb/)

**Caveats**  
No review would be complete without mentioning areas where this sparkling water maker could shine brighter. For one, while the manual operation is a nice touch for sustainability, some may find themselves wishing for an option with automated levels of fizz. I also noticed the dishwasher-safe bottle, though convenient, could look a bit worn after several cleaning cycles. If you‚Äôre a stickler for aesthetics, that might bother you. Additionally, many reviews online mention concerns about the long-term availability of compatible gas cylinders. While I haven‚Äôt had issues yet, it‚Äôs a factor that can‚Äôt be ignored.

- Manual operation might not suit all lifestyles  
- Bottles show signs of wear over time  
- Potential limitations in long-term cylinder availability  

**Peer Products**  
In this space of soda makers, the competition is bubbling over, pun intended. Compared to alternatives like the Aarke Carbonator 3 or the Philips GoZero, the SodaStream Terra offers a more budget-friendly entry point without compromising core functionality. The Aarke Carbonator 3 is undeniably sleek with its metal build but comes at a premium price. However, its performance isn‚Äôt vastly superior to the Terra‚Äôs. The Philips GoZero, on the other hand, offers automation and adjustable fizz levels, but it takes up more counter space and arguably lacks the design elegance of the Terra. Ultimately, the Terra strikes a balance between simplicity and style, albeit without some ""luxury"" extras.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Given its modest price point compared to its competitors, the SodaStream Terra delivers remarkable value for what you‚Äôre getting. The fact that you can reduce plastic waste and avoid lugging bulky sparkling water bottles home only adds to its appeal. While it might not have every single modern feature, it's more than capable of handling everyday needs without breaking the bank. Whether you're looking to hydrate effortlessly or whip up fancy drinks for guests, it handles it all with ease.

|**Aesthetic** (""kitchen compatibility""; subjective)|Best|Good|Good|

The Multibin plate will also require printing more inserts (not accounted for in the table above) to make it usable. However, I won't need them *everywhere*. For example, my manual coffee grinder covers 3x8 holes on both openGrid and Multiboard. Only one snap is needed to hold the grinder, leaving the other 23 holes behind it unused, so no need for the extra filament in that area.

I'm more familiar with Multiboard than openGrid, so maybe there's something that I don't know about that could sway my decision towards openGrid. Any suggestions?",1,1759077759.0,openGrid,4,1.0,False

We‚Äôll wander through two of Brooklyn‚Äôs most historic neighborhoods, known for their Italian-American roots, Middle Eastern migration, and beautiful brownstones lining tree-lined streets starting to show early fall colors.

We‚Äôll kick things off with savory Italian bites, dive into Middle Eastern flavors, and wrap it up with some sweet treats. Just one sit-down stop; the rest we‚Äôll enjoy on-site, soaking in the crisp fall air, colorful streets, and each other‚Äôs company.

Here‚Äôs the plan:

1. Mazzola Bakery (Italian-American). Start with their famous prosciutto/lard bread and savory Italian loaves.

2. Panzerotti / Italian Street Food (Italian/Sicilian) ‚Äì Small fried panzerotto stuffed with mozzarella, tomato, or other savory fillings, a classic Southern Italian street snack.

3. Damascus Bread & Pastry Shop (Syrian). Enjoy fresh pita, falafel, and meat sandwiches, along with hummus and veggie options, at this family-owned bakery carrying three generations of tradition.

4. Al Badawi (Palestinian). Our sit-down spot. A perfect chance to relax and savor shared dishes like taboon bread, lamb, chicken, and mezze like hummus and baba ghanouj.

5. Malai (Globally Inspired Ice Cream). Finish the crawl with internationally inspired ice cream flavors such as Turkish Coffee, Masala Chai, or Ginger Root. A refreshing, modern dessert that adds variety to the historical neighborhood food experience.

Estimated cost per person for the full crawl: $50‚Äì80, with Al Badawi accounting for roughly half of the total.

2. Generic hobbies: ‚Äútraveling, food, long walks, wine‚Äù - wow, you and literally every human being alive.
3. Scheduling a date that feels like booking a meeting with your manager.¬†*‚ÄúHow does 3 weeks from Thursday look for a quick 30-minute coffee slot?‚Äù*
4. A proud declaration that you‚Äôre a ‚Äúplant mom,‚Äù immediately followed by ‚Äúlol I kill every plant I touch.‚Äù (Congrats, you‚Äôve mastered the art of buying ferns just to commit slow botanical murder.)
5. Something about being ‚Äúfluent in sarcasm‚Äù like it‚Äôs a rare skill.
6. A claim that you‚Äôre ‚Äúso bad at texting‚Äù even though your screen time is 9 hours a day.

So let‚Äôs skip all that.

About me: I‚Äôm in London, I work in finance, and yes, I travel (though I‚Äôve never been ‚Äúdetained in Spain,‚Äù so maybe I‚Äôm missing out). I‚Äôm more into finding the best dim sum spot in Chinatown, a strong negroni, or a last minute trip abroad.

What I‚Äôm looking for: something light, casual, fun. Not a serious relationship right now. Just meeting people who don‚Äôt treat dating like an admin task, enjoying a laugh, and seeing where it goes without the pressure.

**Things I appreciate:**

* A conversation that lasts more than 4 texts.
* Someone who can enjoy both a ballet at the Royal Opera House and a late-night kebab on the way home.
* A partner who doesn‚Äôt think ‚Äútraveling‚Äù is a personality, but still has a valid passport.
* A sense of humour about how ridiculous dating apps have become.
* Binge watching reality tv and gossiping about the drama.
* Meeting IRL - London based would be ideal.

1nssvy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nssvy7/hair_today_gone_tomorrow_the_onion_years/,"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow: The Onion Years","An excerpt from my story, which I published this week

I used to be a man with hair. Not just any hair, mind you, but what I considered to be a¬†**magnificent, deity-level crown**¬†of brown waves that shimmered like chocolate silk under Port Alberni‚Äôs four minutes of annual sunshine. At least, that‚Äôs what I told myself every morning in our tiny bathroom mirror while Susan yelled through the door that I was fogging it up again.

The truth, as I‚Äôve come to learn, is a slippery thing. Like trying to grab wet soap while blindfolded, or trying to cling to the last few strands of a dying follicular civilization.

It all began on a Tuesday in March 2003, which already feels like the kind of date baldness would choose for an ambush. I was getting ready for my shift at the mill, humming the¬†*Hockey Night in Canada*¬†theme, running my fingers through what I still believed to be my Samson-level locks, when I felt it. Or rather‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel it.

Where there should‚Äôve been a soft thicket of virile man-mane, there was just¬†**skin**. Smooth. Pale. Betraying me like Judas in a shampoo aisle.

I froze. Boxer shorts. Work socks. One hand suspended in horror on the back of my head. I looked into the mirror like I was discovering a new continent, except this one was bald, shiny, and utterly treacherous.

‚ÄúSUSAN!‚Äù I hollered, summoning her like a man whose house was on fire, except the fire was emotional and located on the top of his head.

She appeared with her coffee mug, wearing that face wives get when their husbands are being dramatic again. ‚ÄúWhat now, Dave?‚Äù

I pointed at my scalp like it was evidence in a murder trial. ‚ÄúLook at this! It‚Äôs gone! Vanished! My hairline has officially surrendered.‚Äù

She squinted, took a casual sip of her coffee, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going bald. So?‚Äù

# The Descent Into Hair Loss Madness

This is where I should‚Äôve accepted it, where I should‚Äôve embraced the natural flow of aging with grace and maturity.

Instead, I went full mad scientist.

First, I bought a bottle of ""All-Natural Hair Regrow"" oil from the farmer‚Äôs market. The label claimed it was made from ‚Äúancient Himalayan root extract‚Äù and ‚Äúblessed by monks.‚Äù It smelled like expired pickles and barn wood. I applied it nightly while chanting ‚Äúgrow, baby, grow‚Äù like I was coaxing a Chia Pet.

Then I tried standing on my head for ten minutes a day. The internet said ‚Äúincreased scalp circulation‚Äù was the key. All it gave me was a herniated feeling in my left eye and a reputation at the mill for being ‚Äúthat guy who‚Äôs training for the upside-down Olympics.‚Äù

Susan caught me massaging onion juice into my scalp one night. I‚Äôd read somewhere that raw onion juice stimulates hair growth. She walked into the bathroom, took one look at me rubbing my head like I was marinating it, and said, ‚ÄúIf the house starts smelling like soup stock, you're sleeping in the shed.‚Äù

Hey people of Reddit. Im here for a reality check for my upcoming project of  DIY Picopresso broke edition. Concept is simple, using 4cup basket in which would be coffee and hot water. On top there would be backflush basket with drilled holes for bike valve for pressurizing, safety pressure valve, manometer and one way valve for connecting to the system (bottom pic) , gasket between the top and the bottom basket, everything sandwiched in between some kind of structure.

Standalone it would work something like this: Basket gets filled with coffee, tamped, topped with puck screen on which would be poured hot water, sandwiched and pressurized with bike pump (probably high pressure shock pump).

In the system there would be a microcontroler, vibration pump, kettle, water pump, digital thermometer, water flow valve and few buttons. I imagine it working like this: basket gets filled with coffee and sandwiched, kettle already on- thermometer measuring temp and turning it of when reaching 96C. I press button for Lungo, water pump fills basket with 60ml of water - measures with the flow valve, after it is filled, vibration pump starts pumping for 2times espresso time. 

this all sounds pretty easy in concept, but im sure it is not that easy, i still have time to choose theme from a list but i did want to make the standalone version for myself (one of the teachers told me only the standalone version would be too easy for school year project). Also i have zero knowledge in programming microcontrollers and just a basic knowledge of programming. Let me hear your opinions.

I just bought my first AeroPress and I honestly have zero experience with coffee. Up until now I‚Äôve only been using a capsule machine, but I want to switch for the sake of both money and better taste.

I usually drink 2 cups every morning and often another one around lunch. On my shopping list so far I‚Äôve got:
	‚Ä¢	Standard AeroPress
	‚Ä¢	Kingrinder P0
	‚Ä¢	A small Amazon coffee scale
	‚Ä¢	A gooseneck kettle (not temperature-adjustable, since the precise ones felt a bit too expensive for now, i bought everything so far from amazon and havent seen an adjustable gooseneck kettle below 70‚Ç¨ feel free to tell me if you got some other kettles or products i should look at)

Since I don‚Äôt have a full setup yet, my main goal is to brew something tasty in the morning without too much hassle.

I also got some regular 200ml cups and if i want to drink 2 coffees in the morning should i get a coffee server?

Also I‚Äôm wondering:
	‚Ä¢	Are there any must-have accessories beyond the basics?
	‚Ä¢	Is it really worth investing in a precise temperature-control kettle?

I‚Äôm new to Vancouver and still in the middle of settling in. With a bit of free time on my hands, I‚Äôd really like to make some new connections. So far, finding friends here has been tougher than I expected, but I‚Äôm hopeful!

A little about me: I‚Äôm an ambivert, easygoing, non-judgmental, positive, fun person. I enjoy good conversations and I‚Äôm always up for sharing a laugh.

Something I love about Van: I am in love with the nature view here ‚Äî the ocean, the beaches, the parks, the mountains. I know locals might be used to it, but it‚Äôs all still new to me, and I‚Äôm honestly in awe every time. 

I‚Äôm into gaming and all things nerdy. If you love a game, chances are I‚Äôve heard of it and can talk about it forever. Right now I‚Äôm not gaming as much since I‚Äôm busy settling in and focusing on meeting people, but I follow new releases and streamers so I‚Äôm still in the loop. I also used to host and play DnD and other tabletop games back home, so if you‚Äôre into that, even better.

Another interest of mine is finance and budgeting. I love learning about it, thrifting, and finding smart ways to manage money. Oddly, finance movies are my comfort movies. Like *The Big Short*, *Inside Job*, *Margin Call*. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm obsessed, but I‚Äôll definitely appreciate a fellow finance nerd. That being said, I enjoy movies a lot as well, I can talk about popular movies, tv-series etc. I didn't watch rom-coms tho so don't be disappointed.

As for what I don‚Äôt really vibe with: I‚Äôm not big on nightclubs, heavy drinking, or long multi-day camping/hiking trips. But I do love chilling in the city, exploring new spots, grabbing food or coffee, and just enjoying good company.

If you‚Äôre looking for someone easy to hang out with, chat about something you enjoy, or just life in general, hit me up. Would love to grab a coffee or check out something in the city together.",5,1759076859.0,Vancouver4Friends,5,0.86,False

When I looked up abortion on YouTube, I found way more pro-life content than pro-choice. Most of it was angry, full of accusations of ‚Äúmurder,‚Äù with barely a hint of empathy. I cried quietly so my family wouldn‚Äôt hear. And I kept thinking: it‚Äôs 2025. How is this still happening?

What if one day I find myself in that situation and no one will help me? What if my daughter, my friend, or someone I love needs help and the people we‚Äôre supposed to trust ‚Äî doctors ‚Äî turn their backs?

Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I found all of this out so late. But still‚Ä¶ how? How are we still like this in 2025?",1,1759076568.0,prochoice,0,1.0,False
1nssj8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nssj8y/does_uskich_0012_water_bottle_cleaning_tablet/,Does USKICH 0012 Water Bottle Cleaning Tablet Live Up to Its 5-Star Reviews?,"**Cleansing Power in a Tiny Tablet**

The USKICH 0012 Water Bottle Cleaning Tablets have become a regular part of my daily routine. As someone who owns multiple stainless steel water bottles and an ever-growing collection of thermoses, tumblers, and reusable water containers, keeping those spick-and-span is no small challenge! Beyond regular rinsing, deep cleaning has always been a bit of a chore, especially when dealing with persistent coffee stains and that vague funky smell water bottles often take on after a few days. These tablets aim to solve that problem with simplicity, and I was keen to test how well they truly worked.

**Quick and Effortless Cleaning**

I tossed one tablet into my trusty insulated bottle with some warm water and left it for 30 minutes. Seeing the fizzing reaction kickstart was satisfying, letting me know it was doing its job. The instructions claimed it required no scrubbing, and‚Äîsurprisingly‚Äîit held true! After a quick rinse, my bottle's interior looked spotless, and the stubborn tea stain I had been cursing at was completely gone. It's also refreshing not having to dig out bottle brushes or scrub in awkward angles anymore. These tiny fizzing wonders take all the effort out of it.

**Safe and Eco-Friendly Formula**

Concerns over cleaning products possibly leaving harmful residues or adding strange chemical scents to drinking containers are valid, but that‚Äôs not been an issue with these tablets. Plant and mineral-based materials make up the formula, which offers peace of mind while ensuring eco-friendliness. My kids frequently use stainless steel bottles for school, and I feel reassured knowing their hydration sources are being cleaned with a safe and non-toxic option. That extra layer of safety is something I didn‚Äôt realize I valued so highly until I began using this product.

**Performance That Impresses**

Stubborn smells and stains have no chance standing up to these water bottle cleaning tablets. After cleaning an old coffee tumbler, the faint scent of burnt roast (a remnant of dozens of forgettable work mornings) vanished completely. Similarly, I tested it on a juice-stained plastic container from my daughter's breakfast on the go‚Äîand voil√†, no residual smell. The container looks and smells like new. My coffee tastes untainted, my water feels pure, and overall, the tablets genuinely leave these everyday essentials fresher than they‚Äôve been in years.

**Portable and Perfect For Travelers**

With a decent supply of 48 cleaning tablets, this set is not just practical for daily kitchen use but easily lends itself to outdoor adventures. I tried them out during a recent camping trip, where portable sanitation became a necessity. Even out in the wild, it only takes a bottle of warm(ish) water and 30 minutes of patience to clean hydration bladders or containers. Their individually packaged form makes them ridiculously easy to pack for hiking and road trips as well.

**Highlights**

- Super easy to use‚Äîjust drop in water and let the fizzing begin.
- Powerful against tough stains like coffee, tea, and red wine.
- Plant-based and mineral-based ingredients make it safe for you and eco-friendly.
- Removes odor effortlessly, leaving bottles fresh for your next use.
- Compact and travel-friendly, ideal for camping and outdoor activities.

**Areas for Improvement**

While my overall experience has been solid, there are a couple of small areas worth mentioning that could be improved upon for future versions of this product.

- Works best with warm water but doesn‚Äôt perform as effectively with room temperature or cold water.
- Residual foam can sometimes take multiple rinses to entirely disappear.
- Price might feel slightly steep compared to generic cleaning alternatives, though the convenience compensates for it.

**Other Options**

Comparing these tablets to the generic liquid cleaners or powders marketed for bottle cleaning, the difference in usability stands out. Traditional products often demand scrubbing and may still leave a faint residue, whereas this product simplifies the process. Products like Bottle Bright tablets or Klean Kanteen's cleaning solutions come quite close but lack the balance between odor removal, stain power, and universal safety found in this formula. Brand-specific cleaners often feel limited to particular materials, whereas this versatile formula handles stainless steel, plastic, and glass with equal efficiency.

**Budget-Friendly Cleaning Solution**

Considering what you get out of the USKICH 0012 Water Bottle Cleaning Tablets, these packs absolutely feel worth it. Regular reliance on brushes, liquid soaps, or powders ends up being a hassle (and sometimes pricier in the long run if ineffective). The punch these tablets deliver against odor and stain compared to some competing brands I‚Äôve tried puts them miles ahead. Sure, the initial investment is there, but when you consider the time saved and how easy the cleaning is made, it feels like money smartly spent.

I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I‚Äôm actually lonely. I‚Äôm hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I‚Äôm not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I‚Äôm open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I‚Äôm looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let‚Äôs ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let‚Äôs talk about random crap, or about important things. Let‚Äôs share our life experiences, our passions, or what we‚Äôre having for dinner. Let‚Äôs share photo‚Äôs of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!

You don‚Äôt have to be into the same stuff as me, but I‚Äôll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you‚Äôd be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I‚Äôm a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again. Having said all that, I've just started a postgraduate course through work, so most of my evenings for the foreseeable future will probably be spent studyingüòÖ

I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I‚Äôm just sharing this because I think it‚Äôs good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I‚Äôm open-minded concerning personal battles.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
