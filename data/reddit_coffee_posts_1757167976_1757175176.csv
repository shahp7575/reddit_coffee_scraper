1na3fr3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1na3fr3,Cambodian food at Blue Apsara on South Lamar,"I've been twice now to the Blue Apsara Cambodian food trailer on South Lamar in the lot of Frond Plant Shop, and really loved the food both times. The owners are super friendly and also patient with questions about the menu. There is indoor seating and a restroom inside Frond and Desnudo Coffee is also parked there in case you need caffeine. 

Everything is good, but my favorites were: 

beef sticks, either the regular (comes with sticky rice and veggie pickles) or the combo (comes with sticky rice and papaya salad, one of the best papaya salads I've had in ATX.

fish amok: steamed custard-like coconut milk fish curry in a banana leaf cup

chicken curry: comes with jasmine rice or baguette

I am 23 years old and live in the Midwest. I am a non-denominational Christian. For most of my life I was a lukewarm Christian, I went to Church with my family but I didn't live a Godly life. A couple months ago I felt the Lord calling on my heart to follow him and he has changed my life. I was baptized in March of 2025, I've felt God change me as a person and I can't wait to see what he has prepared for me!

For a first date I'm good with getting coffee at some point in person. I love studying human biology and learning about how the body functions. It has made me appreciate how incredible life really is. A little bit about me is I love to watch movies, especially oldies. I'm 6'0"" and have a slender frame, I also have brown hair and blue eyes. My favorite film of all time is ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I watch it every year. I go jogging all the time out in the corn fields. Occasionally, I play video games like Minecraft and The Sims. I'd love to have game nights or movie nights, or best of all, both!

When God saved me, I realized my calling was to pursue a career in the medical field. I have given my life to Jesus Christ. I want to get to a point where I read the Bible every day and think about what God wants of me before I act. I'm looking for someone who wants to build a relationship through Jesus. I want someone who loves to spend time in the word. I'm up for someone between the ages of 20 and 26, and I hope to have children one day!

When it comes to a long distance relationship I am up for that but know it may be difficult at times.  I wish I could relocate in the future, however I'm unable to while pursuing my career due to the cost associated and the program is located in my home state. I'm not comfortable dating someone who lives outside of the United States, sorry. Feel free to sent me a message and God bless!",1,1757174954.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

There was a coffee shop I really liked close to downtown; the owner had a small lot that connected to a building where you could go and run some board games; he would sell coffee from this vintage looking van - similar to a volkswagen from what I remember. He also had a wooden stage out on the lot that he personally built to perform his music. The name is completely leaving me, anyone know the name of the spot I'm referring to?   

Additionally, there's another coffee spot on Montana that these two brothers owned. It has a white brick interior and was connected to a barbershop from what I recall. If anyone knows the name of either place I'd really appreciate it!",0,1757174765.0,ElPaso,1,0.5,False

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: Vital Statistics and Market Trends\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., Bahrain posted a record non-oil GDP growth of 5.9% in Q1 2025, positioning itself as a regional leader in post-oil economic diversification. The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) forecasts total FDI inflows topping $2.5 billion this year, fueled by financial services, fintech, telecoms, and health sectors.\
However, such meteoric growth comes with enhanced scrutiny—especially in regulated industries like:\
- Financial services\
- Healthcare and pharmaceuticals\
- Insurance\
- Telecommunications\
- Food and beverage\
- Education\
- Transportation\
New regulations implemented in April 2025 have tightened licensing controls for fintech and insurance firms, reflecting both investor demand and compliance with global AML standards. As Forbes Business notes, Bahrain’s pro-business reforms are counterbalanced by a strong framework of sector-specific controls, ensuring market stability and investor confidence.\
\
What Qualifies as a Regulated Industry in Bahrain?\
Bahrain draws clear lines between standard commercial activities and those that require sectoral oversight. Regulated industries are generally overseen by specialized authorities such as:\
* Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) — for banking, insurance, fintech\
* Ministry of Health (MoH) — for clinics, pharmacies, hospitals\
* Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (MTT)\
* Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA)\
* Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT)\
* National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA)\
Surprisingly, some sectors you might not expect—like real estate brokers and private education providers—have recently (since January 2025) been added to the regulated list. That caught out more than a few expat entrepreneurs last quarter!\
\
Expert tip: Always check the official Bahrain government business portal for updated lists of regulated activities. Classification sometimes shifts, especially after new FTA or FATF recommendations. (I once had a client’s crypto services platform reclassified overnight after a sudden regulatory update.)\
\
\
Types of Licenses Required: Detailed Breakdown\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.\
All companies—regulated or not—need a Commercial Registration (CR) through the Sijilat portal, administered by MOICT. The CR identifies your legal entity and sets the foundation for all further activities.\
2. Sector-Specific Regulatory Licenses\
\
Banking, fintech, insurance: Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) - Licensing Manual sets out capital requirements, fit-and-proper tests, and compliance reporting.\
Healthcare: Ministry of Health (MoH) & NHRA - Licenses for hospitals, clinics, pharmaceuticals, individual practitioners.\
Telecoms: Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) – Licenses for ISPs, mobile operators, VAS providers.\
Food & Beverage: Food Control Section (MoH) – Food service, importers, manufacturers.\
Education: Ministry of Education (MoE) – Schools, training centers, universities.\
\
Each regulatory body imposes its own:\
- Application process and documentation\
- Minimum capital requirements (e.g., BHD 100,000+ for banks, BHD 1,000 for clinics)\
- Physical office/branch requirements—some must be in designated “business districts” like Seef or Bahrain Bay\
3. Special Activity Approvals\
Some activities need extra clearance:\
- Import/export: Customs Authority pre-approvals\
- Pharmaceuticals: NHRA import license\
- Advertising: Ministry of Information\
Pro tip: Use this resource to match your entity structure with licensing needs.\
\
Costs: What Should You Really Budget For?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.:\
\
Commercial Registration (CR): BHD 100–350 (single activity, annual); BHD 500+ (multiple activities)\
CBB-Regulated Firms: Upfront license: BHD 2,500–30,000+. Annual supervision: BHD 5,000–10,000+\
Healthcare (MoH/NHRA): New facility: BHD 2,000–6,000 setup; BHD 500–1,500 annual\
Telecoms (TRA): Application: BHD 1,000–10,000+, depending on service class\
Education: BHD 1,000–2,500 for private institutions\
\
Don’t forget hidden costs:\
- Office lease in premium zones (Seef District, Diplomatic Area): BHD 7–15 per sqm/month\
- Notarization, translation, and apostilling of foreign documents: BHD 300–800\
- Professional fees (legal, consulting, accounting): BHD 2,000–5,000+ annually\
\
Recent tip: Tamkeen funding for high-growth startups now covers up to 30% of regulatory licensing costs for select sectors (valid through December 2025).\
\
\
License Application Process: Step-by-Step (With Real Insider Hacks)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.)\
- Select activity code(s): via Sijilat. Check for recent reclassifications to avoid misfiling.\
- Prepare core documents: Passport, lease, MOA, board resolution, background checks, sector-specific forms.\
Shortcut: Pre-fill Sijilat drafts during off-peak hours (after 2 pm or before 9 am) to speed up approval—queues at MOICT drop by up to 50% outside of peak.\
b. Submit Commercial Registration Application\
\
File via Sijilat. Attach all base documents. (Avoid uploading PDFs over 10MB or using low-res scans, which can trigger resubmission.)\
For regulated activities, Sijilat auto-forwards your application to the sector regulator.\
\
c. Regulatory License Application\
\
Submit detailed documentation directly to CBB, NHRA, TRA, etc.\
Schedule in-person validation (biometrics, originals inspection) at assigned counters. If you head to the Bahrain Bay EDB office before 10 am midweek, lines are typically shortest.\
Regulatory interviews: Prepare for panel or committee questions—bring all supporting documentation (including stamped business plans and capital statements).\
\
d. Approvals and Commercial Registration Issuance\
\
Provisional CR issued after regulatory greenlight.\
Final CR and regulatory license issued jointly. (If you apply right before Ramadan, expect up to two weeks extra processing.)\
\
e. Post-License Compliance\
\
Register with LMRA for staff visas.\
Enroll in ongoing sectoral compliance—annual audits for CBB licensees, surprise inspections in healthcare/food.\
Set up mandatory bookkeeping (accounting services here).\
\
Personal aside: On my second ever application, I accidentally submitted an illegibly stamped lease. The MOICT officer suggested revisiting the landlord to provide a clearer copy—saving us a costly two-week delay.\
\
Money-Saving and Time-Saving Insider Tips\
\
Lease in “secondary” business districts (like Sanabis or Tubli) for back offices—these are approved for most licenses but cost 25-40% less than prime zone rents.\
Apply for your sector regulator interview immediately after submitting Sijilat docs—don’t wait for the “invitation” email, which can lag.\
Batch notarize and translate all core foreign docs in one session at the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce Notary in Sanabis—you’ll save hundreds in courier and legal fees.\
During Ramadan, submit applications before 10 am and call ahead to key regulators; staff are more available and approvals can sometimes move faster thanks to lighter traffic.\
For free zones, explore Bahrain’s dedicated zones—no customs duty, full foreign ownership, and simplified licensing.\
\
\
Best Business Districts for Licensing, Networking, and Fast-Track Support\
\
Seef District: Home to most regulator offices (MOICT, CBB), strong banking infrastructure. Walk-in support is excellent, especially for urgent queries.\
Diplomatic Area: Houses international law/accounting firms; ideal for complex cross-border licensing.\
Bahrain Bay: EDB, fintech sandbox, and government support hubs; startup-friendly.\
Manama Center: Tamkeen, LMRA, and walk-in Sijilat support—avoid Mondays, as the place gets crowded after weekend closures.\
\
\
I once sidestepped a three-hour queue at the CBB by arriving with my client just after dawn prayers. Unusual, but remarkably effective!\
\
\
Cultural Practices and Regulatory Navigation\
Doing business in Bahrain is inseparable from local custom. Majlis-style meetings—often accompanied by dates and thick Turkish coffee—create informal spaces for relationship-building, even during licensing discussions. During Ramadan, expect shortened hours, and avoid scheduling key meetings at midday. Traditional coffee service (served right hand, always) signals respect and sets the tone for smoother negotiations.\
Compared to UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain stands out for faster document handling, less red tape, and a more open attitude toward foreign founders. 99% foreign ownership is possible, and for most regulated sectors, you only need a local legal service agent—not a full sponsor.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes to Watch\
April 2025: The CBB introduced stricter capital reserve requirements for new insurance and fintech licensees—minimum paid-up capital raised to BHD 150,000 from BHD 100,000. All applications after April 2 must comply.\
January 2025: The NHRA expanded its oversight to wellness clinics and alternative medicine practitioners, prompting a flood of new applications and, for the unprepared, costly delays.\
Policy shifts move quickly here—subscribe to Gulf News Bahrain and the Bahrain EDB portal for real-time updates.\
\
Common Mistake: Underestimating Regulatory Complexity\
One recurring misstep I see: assuming a standard MOICT CR alone suffices for regulated activities. This leads to rejected applications, wasted fees, and lost market opportunities. Always start with a regulatory requirements mapping session. Sit with an advisor, scan the latest Sijilat activity codes, and confirm with the sector regulator before investing in fit-out or staffing.\
Resource you can trust: I recommend KeyLink’s company formation team—their direct relationships with Sijilat and MOICT officers often yield behind-the-scenes updates and pre-checks that prevent rejection.\
\
A Tangent: Networking at Bahrain’s Art Fairs\
It may sound off-topic, but the annual ArtBAB fair at the Bahrain National Museum is a hotbed for regulated industry networking. Whether you want to meet a friendly CBB compliance officer or get a nod from a Tamkeen SME advisor, Bahrain’s art events blend business and culture in an unforced way. More than once, I’ve secured a key licensing hint over a shared cup of gahwa, backdropped by contemporary Bahraini sculpture.\
\
Support Services to Help You Succeed\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.\
- Accounting and post-licensing compliance\
- Foreign ownership planning\
- Local sponsorship resources\
And if in doubt, book an in-person consultation with a bilingual compliance advisor—a little guidance here saves months of frustration.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
Q1: Can I obtain 100% foreign ownership in a regulated Bahraini company?\
Yes! As of 2025, Bahrain allows up to 99% foreign ownership for most sectors, and some fintech, logistics, and manufacturing activities permit 100%. Always consult with both KeyLink’s experts and MOICT to avoid ownership structure pitfalls.\
Q2: What documentation is required for a CBB-regulated financial services license?\
Expect to submit: notarized and translated corporate documents, detailed business plan, evidence of minimum paid-up capital, criminal background checks, board resolutions, and physical office lease. See this primer on Bahrain licensing documentation.\
Q3: How long does licensing take for regulated activities?\
Standard MOICT CR: 3–10 days. Regulated sectors (CBB, NHRA, TRA): allow 4–12 weeks, depending on due diligence. Pressing regulators for status updates in person (especially at Seef HQ) can sometimes speed results.\
Q4: Are free zones a good option for regulated businesses?\
Absolutely—Bahrain’s free zones offer faster processing, no customs duties, and relaxed capital controls for many regulated activities. Check sector eligibility before applying.\
Q5: Can I outsource accounting and compliance after licensing?\
Yes, and I strongly encourage it! Use reputable accounting and compliance firms to stay aligned with CBB, NHRA, and LMRA requirements. This prevents costly fines and maintains your regulatory standing.\
\
\
Final thought: Entering regulated industries in Bahrain is challenging, rewarding, and—if you know where to look for support—surprisingly streamlined compared to its GCC neighbors. Focus on preparation, personal relationships, and careful document handling, and the kingdom’s vibrant business landscape will reward your efforts many times over.",1,1757174756.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False

I am a non-denominational Christian. For most of my life I was a lukewarm Christian, I went to Church with my family but I didn't live a Godly life. A couple months ago I felt the Lord calling on my heart to follow him and he has changed my life. I was baptized in March of 2025, I've felt God change me as a person and I can't wait to see what he has prepared for me!

For a first date I'm good with getting coffee at some point in person. I love studying human biology and learning about how the body functions. It has made me appreciate how incredible life really is. A little bit about me is I love to watch movies, especially oldies. I'm 6'0"" and have a slender frame, I also have brown hair and blue eyes. My favorite film of all time is ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I watch it every year. I go jogging all the time out in the corn fields. Occasionally, I play video games like Minecraft and The Sims. I'd love to have game nights or movie nights, or best of all, both!

When God saved me, I realized my calling was to pursue a career in the medical field. I have given my life to Jesus Christ. I want to get to a point where I read the Bible every day and think about what God wants of me before I act. I'm looking for someone who wants to build a relationship through Jesus. I want someone who loves to spend time in the word. I'm up for someone between the ages of 20 and 26, and I hope to have children one day!

When it comes to a long distance relationship I am up for that but know it may be difficult at times.  I wish I could relocate in the future, however I'm unable to while pursuing my career due to the cost associated and the program is located in my home state. I'm not comfortable dating someone who lives outside of the United States, sorry. Feel free to sent me a message and God bless!",1,1757174615.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I was able to get some of it away from him before he swallowed more, but he definitely got a decent chunk of it, probably about 3 inches worth. The vet said to wait it out and see if he passes it on his own and I am monitoring him closely, but wanted to see if anyone had guidance on a timeline or when/if I should bring him in, also the likelihood of it passing on its own, given the texture and size. (About 3 inches was missing from the mat and the texture is crochet, he likely swallowed it in smaller bits, I’m hoping).

I want to preface this by saying that my dog is on the mild end of reactivity. She’s very shy and fearful which would lead to episodes of growling/barking in the wrong situation- but generally it has been quite manageable. I just want to improve her confidence and teach her that the world doesn’t have to be scary so that we can enjoy things together. 

We have been working so hard the past 6 weeks on desensitization. The first class she barked the ENTIRE time and I was so worried I was making things worse. But thankfully we had the sweetest trainer who worked with us to figure out her triggers (mainly feeling trapped). Her training was less focused on tricks and more on walking laps around the store for an hour each week to slowly meet friendly dogs and strangers. I think having this safe and understanding environment has made a world of difference. I’ve also been taking her out 1-2 more times per week to sit and watch people go by from a park bench or outside a quiet coffee shop. 

It’s been a lot of work for both of us and I’m so proud of her! I’m looking forward to the next 6-weeks of class where we will work on skills for the AKC Good Citizen test!",1,1757174494.0,reactivedogs,0,0.67,False

Recently, I've been interested in the subject of caffeine, and I decided to create a caffeine tracker app.  
It shows you how long ( probably unexpectedly for most) the caffeine stays in your system.  
You have notifications and alerts when you want to add a caffeine too close to your sleep time. 

To celebrate the launch, I'm giving 1 year of subscription free for a day on 7.09.2025!

One morning, we decided to grab some coffee and breakfast at this tiny, old cafe nearby. It had this worn-down charm, kind of dusty but alive with the smell of roasted beans and fresh bread. We called Grandpa to ask what he wanted.

He answered, ""Just the usual black coffee and a slice of that cinnamon bread."" We thought nothing of it and ordered accordingly.

When we got back, Grandpa looked at the bread and then at us, a little frown creasing his face. ""This isn't quite the same,"" he said. But he didn't say much more, just took a small bite and nodded.

It was years later, after he’d passed, that I learned from an old photo album and some faded newspaper clippings that the bakery used to have this special cinnamon bread recipe, something my grandfather swore by. It was handmade with cinnamon from a spice blend custom to the region, a recipe that disappeared sometime in the 1970s when the bakery swapped to mass-produced versions.

My grandfather never mentioned that the bakery changed it was always “the usual” to him. Maybe he remembered the old taste vividly, or maybe he just wanted to hold on to the memories of the bread he loved when he was younger.

It hit me then how much of the past he carried with him, quietly, in small things like a piece of bread. And we were just there, thinking he was being stubborn.",2,1757174336.0,stories,0,1.0,False

(lmk if theres any specific days i should note when its best to have it checked).

however, i just cant help but feel very very anxious and scared but what this might be. since i was examined 2 days before my period started, and when my period started i felt a different lump near my nipple area and my breasts felt so sore and very very sensitive like its swollen inside or sumn and it got kind of bigger. (i did my research and ive read this is very normal). although at the first day of my period by breast didnt felt sensitive, too big and sore but i only felt it after ive had my morning coffee! but there were past instances where ive had similar problems with breast pain specifically during my period and felt lumps before/during my mens.

i dont know im just really overthinking and scared what this might be even though my family has no medical history with breast cancer, but im still worried. i just cant help it",1,1757174332.0,WomensHealth,0,0.99,False

Here’s things I think about after to move on and not dread anything.

1. Money comes and goes, as a sub you want to feel useful as do I. You want to support a person and put their needs above yours. 

2. Recognizing if this a dom you truly wish to send to or if it’s a lustful send. I’ve asked for drains then immediately regret it after nutting cause they were lustful. That’s why these days I don’t really want to be drained. If I see a dom who I admire online but won’t approach, a few coffee sends and possibly a message but often I just silent send

3. Ask yourself if you really think findom is worth it for yourself. Drowning yourself in credit card debt or falling behind on rent is not sustainable and you’ll start to resent findom. Most doms despite some being “unethical” probably deep down don’t want you to fall behind on bills because then they don’t get paid anymore.

Remember at the end of the day you’re in control of where your money goes. If you don’t wish to send to a findom you don’t have to. Just jerk off and go outside lol ",2,1757174206.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,0.75,False

1na327j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/1na327j/ontarios_backtooffice_push_economic_fantasy_meets/,Ontario’s Back-to-Office Push: Economic Fantasy Meets Inflation Reality,"Ontario politicians are demanding a full return to office. Their reasoning isn’t about productivity or collaboration—it’s about reviving downtown economies. Fill up the office towers, sell more coffees, boost transit revenue, and keep commercial landlords afloat. That’s the playbook.

But it doesn’t match reality. Inflation and the cost of living have eroded disposable income. Groceries, rent, utilities, insurance—everything’s more expensive. Wages aren’t keeping pace. Forcing people back doesn’t magically create spending power; it just shifts what little money households already have. That “extra” $200 someone might have used for lunch or transit is already being eaten by rising food and shelter costs.

Short-term effects:

Downtown businesses get a temporary bump—more people buying lunches, more transit passes sold, and a bit of life back in the core.

Workers, however, take the hit. Higher commuting costs, more time wasted in traffic, and added stress. In practice, it’s a stealth pay cut.


Long-term effects:

Household spending doesn’t increase. People already stretched by inflation will cut back elsewhere, so the net effect is flat or negative.

Employers who insist on rigid office policies risk losing talent. Younger workers—Millennials and Gen Z—expect flexibility, and they’ll switch to companies that offer it.

Downtown recovery stalls if office occupancy never returns to pre-COVID levels, leaving cities with half-empty towers and struggling small businesses.


There’s also a generational divide driving this. Many Boomers and Gen X leaders romanticize the old model of office culture, wanting to “bring back” the way things were before 2020. Millennials and Gen Z, on the other hand, have adapted quickly to remote and hybrid work. They see no reason to sacrifice time, money, and well-being just to keep outdated systems alive.

The bottom line: Politicians are trying to rewind the clock to pre-COVID life, but with today’s costs of living, the math doesn’t add up. You can’t stimulate an economy by draining households that are already underwater. The short-term bump downtown is just a band-aid; the long-term impact is a workforce that’s frustrated, less loyal, and increasingly looking for better options elsewhere.",30,1757174084.0,ontario,7,0.81,False

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a WNBA clash that’s about as competitive as a toddler’s tea party—*if the toddler in question is Phoenix Mercury and Connecticut Sun is the one left holding the broken teacup*. The Mercury (playoff-locked, defensive titans) take on the Sun (three-game losing streak, net rating worse than a sieve) in a game that smells like a cover-the-spread guarantee. Let’s break it down with the precision of a coach’s halftime rant and the humor of a Twitter thread after a bad call.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Phoenix is the Obvious Choice

The Mercury are favored by **10-10.5 points** across books, with moneyline odds of **-880 to -920** (implied probability: **\~90%**). For context, that’s like betting on gravity—sure, it’s a law, but you’re still *technically* “winning” by existing. Connecticut’s +525 to +580 odds (implied **\~15-17%**) suggest they’re here to trip over their own feet and hand Phoenix a free win.

Statistically, Phoenix is **top-5 in defensive rating**, holding opponents to 94.2 PPG. The Sun? They’re ninth in net rating over their last 10 games and got blown out by Chicago last week. It’s the basketball equivalent of a leaky faucet vs. a dam. Oh, and Phoenix has beaten Connecticut by **16 points at home** and **8 on the road** this season. The Sun’s recent performance? A three-game losing streak that’s making their fans question if they accidentally signed up for a AAU team.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Slumps, and a Star on Fire (Literally)

Let’s talk about **Satou Sabally**, Phoenix’s forward, whose season average has dipped to **16.3 PPG**. She’s taken **10+ shots in just 1 of her last 6 games**, shooting **39.4% overall** and **30.9% from three**. It’s like she’s playing with a blindfold and a coffee stain on her shot chart. But don’t count her out!

 Cute Fact

Even though Axel looks serious, he gets really flustered if someone compliments his looks or calls him handsome. Clare swears she’s seen his cheek  turn red.


---

 Scary Fact

If his cybernetic control systems malfunction, Axel can enter an “automatic combat mode,” losing all sense of self — like a mechanical beast that can’t tell friend from foe.


---

Normal Fact

He drinks coffee at least once a day. Always black. No sugar. No milk.


---

Sad Fact

Sometimes Axel instinctively checks for a pulse to reassure himself he’s still human… only to remember that half his body is mechanical and he won’t find one. That moment always stings a little.


---

Embarrassing Fact

Once, Axel accidentally short-circuited one of his own systems while trying to look “cool” in front of Clare. He ended up freezing in place and falling over like a robot toy.

* Allegiance and dates of military service: N/A

Complicated but I’m curious if there is a Military Paradox case here? GGGF Naturalized with GGF as a minor, GGF was 18 in 1906 which is before the 50 year window of 1908 from GGGF birth. GGF served in WWI for USA, enlisted but never served in WWII. GM was born in USA to married parents, and married herself after 1951, meaning she could pass to F and self. Question lies on if GGF WWI military service is an issue, or if passage from GGF to GM broke the line for any reason.

For this situation, I am unclear how things would fall with GGM as she only officially relinquished her Russian Empire citizenship. Could she have a claim to Polish citizenship given she may lie claim to the Austrian Partition and then Kingdom of Galicia from Jan 1920 - Oct 1923? Unsure if her naturalization while single voids this even though she never officially relinquished her Polish citizenship. Also unclear if her Polish citizenship would be lost due to marriage in 1924?",1,1757173752.0,prawokrwi,2,1.0,False

This of course, being due to me being weird, resolved and happy and thus for someone to spark my interests HE (or she) has to add to that.

So Im asking people out there in the wide wide world: are there men (or women) that still read and love fantasy, understand 42 is the answer to everything and would be thrilled to talk about vampires, RPGs, life? Go chasing dragons together?

I keep myself in decent shape, but i am not a gym fanatic, I need nature walks and little adventures and coffee, and I am also serious about my spiritual path. I meditate and I work with energy and spirits but I'm also a big advocate for vaccines and science. So I get where my friends are coming from. 

The last person I met for coffee was like ""this energy thing... is such a hocus-pocus thing, sounds like a scam"".. the one before started praying in front of me (in the restaurant!) cause he said ""necromancy is from evil"" and I naively tried to explain that necromancy has to do with raising of commanding the dead (I was thinking DND) and what I do with ghosts is try to help them onto the next plane of existence)... omg lol. My friends had a field trip with that one.

I do meet the ocasional person that is amused. Like I once had a first date at a medieval fair and we shot arrows, threw axes, and whacked each other with training swords. He said that even though  he had never done any of those things, it was the best first date ever. But then, with this sort of person I'm forced to be the manic pixie of the relationship, and I'm so tired of that.

Here where I live it's either nerdy people that dont go out or train at all, or gym enthusiasts that do not read;  I am fine with that so I uninstalled OLD Apps. Also my country is quite sexist still so there's that too. But I was wondering if it is different in other parts of the world and there are people still wanting to go chasing literary, movie or spirit dragons somewhere.

1na2ukn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1na2ukn/can_the_best_thermal_coffee_maker_by_cuisinart/,Can the best thermal coffee maker by Cuisinart improve mornings?,"The Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS has been my go-to coffeemaker over the last month, and I have a lot to share about my experience using it daily. As someone who relies heavily on a good cup of coffee to kickstart the day, I was eager to test this programmable coffee maker and see if it lived up to its hype. Featuring a sleek black thermal design and an impressive set of features, it certainly had the right elements on paper. But, as with any product, there are both advantages and things to consider.

**Build and Design**

One of the first things I noticed was how compact and elegant this coffeemaker looks on the kitchen counter. Its slim profile fits perfectly in my small kitchen space without giving that clunky appliance vibe. The carafe, designed to hold up to 10 cups, feels sturdy with its ergonomic handle and knuckle guard. If you've got butterfingers like me first thing in the morning, you'll appreciate the drip-free spout, which ensures zero coffee mess on your countertop. The overall construction leans more toward practical durability than premium, which is perfectly fine for the price point.

**Functionality and Ease of Use**

Setting this coffee maker up was surprisingly easy. With its intuitive buttons and a bright LCD clock, I could program my brew time and settings within minutes. The 24-hour programmability is handy for people with tight mornings—like when my 8:30 AM Zoom meetings sneak up on me. Brew Pause is another neat trick that lets me grab a quick pour before the brewing completes. I used it more often than I'd thought, especially on those rushed mornings when patience isn't my strong suit.

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b096l473mk/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**

The critical question: does it make good coffee? Overall, I’ve been impressed. The 10-cup thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours—a big win for me since my work-from-home schedule means multiple trips back to the kitchen for refills. The coffee consistently tastes clean, thanks to the reusable gold-tone filter and charcoal water filter. It’s worth noting, though, that the brewing process can be affected by grind size. Once I figured out the right grind level for my grounds, the taste improved significantly. If you're a coffee enthusiast like me, experimenting a little might just be part of the fun.

**Benefits**

This coffeemaker brings several winning points that make it stand out:

• Compact design, ideal for smaller kitchens  
• Keeps coffee hot for hours without burning the flavor  
• Programmable 24-hour timer for added convenience  
• Equipped with reusable filters for eco-conscious users  

**Pitfalls**

However, it’s not perfect, and there are some areas for improvement:

• The plastic construction doesn’t feel quite premium  
• Brew strength settings are absent, limiting customization  
• Thermal carafe pouring can be slow at times  

**Competing Options**

In its price range, the marketplace offers several other coffee makers with similar features. For instance, compared to the similar-sized Mr. Coffee Programmable Brewer, the Cuisinart model has a more durable thermal carafe that genuinely keeps coffee warm for longer. On the other hand, Ninja’s drip coffee machines tend to include a wider range of brew-strength settings and sleeker designs, though they might creep into a slightly higher budget category. While all options have their merits, this product holds its own in balancing price and features.

**Value for Money**

If cost-efficiency is a factor in your buying decision, this coffeemaker is worth the investment. The reusable filter and durable carafe save money over time by reducing the need for disposable items and repeat purchases. For coffee lovers who prioritize a reliable, hot cup of joe without splurging on high-end machines, this strikes a solid balance between affordability and quality. Though it lacks some advanced features, for everyday use, it gets the job done.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Syracuse vs. UConn: A Tale of Two Offenses and a Defense That Needs a Nap**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans—or, more accurately, a clash of a titan (Syracuse’s defense) with a particularly peckish squirrel (UConn’s offense). The Orange, fresh off a five-game winning streak, host the Huskies in a matchup that’s less “gladiators” and more “why did I think I could survive on coffee alone?” Let’s break this down with the precision of a caffeinated spreadsheet.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Can’t Skip

The numbers scream “Syracuse, baby!” louder than a student yelling “I’ll study for the test… tomorrow!” The Orange are favored at decimal odds of \~1.34 (implied probability: \~75%), while UConn sits at 3.35 (\~30%). That’s not just a spread—it’s a chasm. The line is set at 7 points, and the total is 57.5, which feels like the bookmakers are hedging their bets on whether Syracuse’s defense will finally learn how to spell “shutdown.”

---

### Digesting the News: Two Teams, Two Stories

**Syracuse**: The Orange are a circus of versatility, with 17-year-old Demetres Samuel Jr. juggling cornerback and wide receiver like a human pinball wizard. Then there’s Jamie Tremble, the tight end turned SAM linebacker, who’s basically the NFL’s version of a “try before you buy” sample. Their defense? A sieve that let Tennessee rush for 246 yards last week. Head coach Fran Brown’s gratitude toward UConn’s coach for “making the Northeast competitive” sounds less like sportsmanship and more like a cry for help.

**UConn**: The Huskies opened with a 59-13 thrashing of Central Connecticut, a performance so dominant it makes a toddler’s monopoly game look tense. QB Joe Fagnano completed 72% of his passes for 260 yards and a pick-six (to himself? Unlikely, but we can dream). Skyler Bell a

A couple of weeks ago, maybe even 3-4 weeks, I thawed shrimp in the fridge, they were frozen in a sealed bag so I stupidly thought I could just put the bag straight into the fridge without protection and boy am I regretting my stupidity now.

My fridge stinks of shrimp every time I open it, and it is ruining my life. I’ve cleaned it out top to bottom with Ajax Universal cleaning, I’ve taken out all the shelves and cleaned those too, I removed the removable plastic edges on the shelves and cleaned under those too. I took out all the food from the fridge and put it in sealed plastic bags to see if something else was the offender, and still it smells.

I even plugged the little drain hole at the bottom of the inside of the fridge with gauze to see if the smell was coming from in there, and no change. 

I’ve kept plates of ground coffee and and baking soda in the fridge too, and nothing has helped.

I’m losing my mind. What am I missing here? Why does it still smell so bad? There’s no condensation drawer to clean out, I’ve scrubbed the inside of the drainage hole. I can’t physically pull out the fridge either, it’s surrounded by cupboard walls and too heavy.

**Little about me:**

I'm a professional that travels often all across the South and Midwest for both work and my personal hobbies. I'm engineer by training but these days I work in technical sales educating people on my companies product line. Typically I travel once a month to DFW and then each month I go out of state.

These days I have a pretty regimental fitness routine. Start each day with a 2 mile walk with a cup of coffee. Afternoons are resistance training and evenings I either go for a walk around the lake nearby my home or hit the shooting range.

I use to be an avid gamer but cut way back over the last 10 years to spend my free time more active and outdoors. When I lived in Washington state I was an avid backpacker and spent most of my weekends in the mountains of Olympic National Park. These days in Texas my primary outdoor activity is competitive shooting. I train often and compete nationally now.

Politically I am more moderate. I grew up conservative back in Alaska, but as I grow older I see both sides of the line. I tend to make political decisions with what makes common sense and also supports my values, which these days is pretty hard.

My top values are integrity, kindness, compassion, honesty, and determination.

When it comes to family / kids I knew awhile back that fatherhood was never for me and had a vasectomy.

Financially I am very stable and live debt free.

**What am I looking for?**

Someone who can relate to what I've written above. I am a highly independent and financially stable person that is looking to build a partnership with someone. I don't think life is meant to be experienced alone, its meant to be shared with someone. I'm fine with a long distance relationship since I am very open to moving. With my line of work, I can really be anywhere. Age is also not a factor for me, either younger or older.

Did some research, asked my Mom and decided a heathy safe option was best, I got a couple of my moms smooth more teabags for the weekend and yesterday bought a carton of Sunsweet prune juice.

Given that I only had today to sort my problem in privacy, I had 12 fl oz of Pune Juice, chased with one Smooth Move teabag steeped in boiling water for a good 10 mins. I also had water beside the bed and sipped on it whenever I turned over.. what could possibly go wrong?

Fast forward to this morning, I woke earlyish with a feeling like a bowling ball moving round my stomach, not painful but strange.. I lay there for a few more minutes to see if the feeling passed, then I had a sudden 'arrival feeling', I clenched it off and decided to make way to the bathroom, I had barely arrived at a hover when everything broke loose. Thank goodness I decided to go when I did.

Much relieved I want to make myself a coffee in the kitchen, still in PJ shorts and tee top, thankfully panties under too! Just in case.

I was sat two ot three sips into coffee reading SM posts when the second feeling arrived, a slight rumble like gas and a feeling like the same, knowing I had purged.

1na2pbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1na2pbu/does_spot_shot_ss163_carpet_stain_remover_really/,Does Spot Shot SS16-3 Carpet Stain Remover Really Work? A Detailed Review,"The WD-40 COMPANY SS16-3 Instant Carpet Stain Remover, offered in a convenient 16 OZ [3-PACK], has turned into an essential item in my cleaning arsenal. With its promise of quickly eliminating stubborn carpet stains without the need for laborious scrubbing, I was eager to see if it could meet its bold claims. Over the past few weeks, I’ve tested this product during post-dinner clean-ups, after accidental coffee spills, and even on those mysterious stains that no one in the house ever claims responsibility for. 

**Ease of Use**  
One feature I immediately appreciated was how simple the cleaning process was. The directions are practically foolproof: blot or vacuum the area first, shake the can gently, tilt it at a slight angle, spray, and blot the stain away with a white cloth. No vacuuming or scrubbing necessary—just spray and blot! This was a game changer, especially with a household as busy (and messy) as mine. My kids occasionally lend a hand, using the spray after sneaky soda spills, proving how effortless the steps are.

**Performance**  
As someone who juggles cleaning up after pets, kids, and, occasionally, highly enthusiastic guests, I need a stain remover that addresses a variety of stains. This product claimed to work on everything from pet accidents and red wine to permanent markers and motor oil. Frankly, I was skeptical about those last two. Still, every single test turned out surprisingly well. A week-old juice spill on my beige rug? Gone. Ink stains under the dining table? Vanished like it never existed. Even the mud stains from a rainy day looked like a ghost of a memory post-cleaning. It definitely lives up to its ""One Shot. No Spot."" tagline.  

**Benefits**  
- Effortless application—no scrubbing or vacuuming required.  
- Effective on a variety of stains, including tough ones like red wine and motor oil.  
- Safe for carpets while also neutralizing odors.  

**Critiques**  
- Strong chemical smell during use.  
- Cannot be used on all fabric types—test a small spot first.  

**Package and Design**  
The three-pack offering not only ensures cost-efficiency but also provides enough product for extended use or multiple locations. With dimensions of 2.63 x 7.87 x 9.5 inches and weighing just under 4 pounds, the cans are easy to store under the sink or in cleaning closets. The nozzle design facilitates targeted spraying—no unpleasant splatter or waste.  

**Other Products**  
There are alternatives available on the market, such as Resolve Carpet Cleaner or Bissell SpotClean Pro. While these products can also tackle diverse stain types, they might require some scrubbing or additional equipment like vacuum cleaners, unlike this spray-and-blot product. Furthermore, the Spot Shot’s ability to liquefy particles and completely lift them out might be where it has the edge. However, competitors occasionally offer a lighter scent, which may suit those sensitive to strong odors better.    

**Affordable Quality**  
The value proposition of this product stands strong. While some eco-friendly or professional-grade carpet cleaners cost significantly more, this three-pack ensures you get effective performance without breaking the bank. The stain remover's ability to eliminate common and uncommon stains alike turns it into an invaluable ally for households like mine, always wrestling with spills and accidents.

1na2nqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1na2nqm/first_date_with_an_old_friend_whom_i_secretly/,"First ""date"" with an old friend whom I secretly liked for a long time","Title sums it up pretty well. I (27M) have known this girl (27F) since high school. I used to really like her back then, but never let her know anything. Both of us took different paths in life, I had a long relationship of 6 years which ended a few years ago and she used to live with her ex-boyfriend. This changed a few months ago: after a reunion with our old common friends she offered me a ride back home. I asked how was her life and she told me that she broke up with her bf. My heart skipped a beat, but it was not the best timing yet, as I was about to leave the country for a few months for work and she was still living with her bf due to financial reasons. During my period abroad, I texted her a few times on random topics and she reciprocated. A week ago I hosted another reunion dinner at my place. It was a good evening, and at the end, when everyone left, she decided to stay to help me cleaning the dishes. She really helped me a lot and we talked non stop, we even played a tabletop game she suggested while we talked until past 3 am. She went back home and I decided to not make any moves, not even hugging her to say good bye (which is pretty common). The next day I texted her and asked her if I could offer her a coffee or a drink sometimes to thank her for all the help, and she proposed to meet for a beer the next weekend. After that we texted each other every day (albeit with very few messages) about random topics of interest we share in common. Tonight is the fateful night and I really do not know how I should act. She is very busy, she works two jobs and studies at the same time, and right now her life is changing a lot. I do not want to force things if the time isn't right, and I do not even know if she is attracted to me or not, but at the same time I really don't want to miss this opportunity with her.

1na2ngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1na2ngz/what_are_peoples_experience_when_having_homecare/,What are people's experience when having homecare provided by the Local Authority?,"I currently am a recipient of social care from the council. I had 6 weeks from the NHS, who contracted out to a relatively competent company (in comparison, but they were truly awful at times).
Moving to Local Authority, I now have had 5 days of carers. From the past 5 days, I have had 4 different people. All of which need showing how to work a coffee machine, where everything is and where everything goes for them to do what I need, 2 of them 'forgot' to change their gloves in between emptying the urine bottle and then preparing food (it really should not be my prompting them to comply with basic hygiene, right?), one chap had to use Google translate because he only seemed to understand the words 'Tea' 'coffee' 'yes' 'no' 'milk' 'water' (I asked him to get me something from a cupboard and he looked at me blankly and said 'no understand. No english.'), they have 2 calls a day, between 8-10am and 6-630pm. 2 occasions 2 different people turn up at nearly 12pm, one chap was moaning and huffing and puffing and tutting and sighing, then has a go at me because he hates his job and the agency treat him like shit, so he is slamming about and shouting at my dog to leave him alone (btw, all carers are terrified by dogs despite me telling the care agency I have pets).
All this is in 4 and a half days. 9 calls. 
This is not unusual. In the past, I asked for a bowl of tomato soup. I got given a bowl of plum tomatoes, cold. Another time I asked for a cheese sandwich. They sliced the butter thicker than the cheese, so it was - slice of bread, 4 slices butter, 3 slices cheese, 4 slices butter, slice of bread.

I know the care industry is in the doldrums, but I am compus mentus. If they are treating me like this, how are they treating others who are elderly? It absolutely beggars belief.

The same company has been assigned to me as the last time I needed them during my recuperation. 

The lack of continuous care is stressing me out. It makes my blood pressure rise every time I see they have sent someone different. None of them seem to know what to do. Just stare blankly at me. They have a care plan (surely??) so they must know SOME basics of my needs. 

I have dealt with carers myself, with my parents and grandparents, and it is all the same. Local Authority contracts go to the very worst of the worst. The CQC reports for the company I have, are all 'Needs improvement', and has been this way the past 3 assessments. Surely the LA must have criteria?? 

This care company are simply the worst company for care I have ever had the misfortune of being a recipient of and if I had contracted them I would have told them where to go by now. They hire people who don't even speak English... I mean FFS... This is the UK. 99% Of the service users are elderly English speakers. That's basic! Absolutely pathetic company who should just be struck off for their lack of ability to provide a basic level of care. 

So, that's my rant. I wanna hear stories from others so I don't feel as bad. 

I'm 45, out of long term hospital care.

The thought of taking prisoners was dead. No more belt and martial arts shenanigans. I had my cane of cold ready to go, and Hecate was happy to not change her strategy at all. Our pace was quick, sparing only a sliver time to remain alert.

There were no further encounters on our trip down Matti and Ilyim’s path. A portion of the walk had rotted away, so I froze the water and darted across the ice without breaking stride. Up ahead, I saw the best thing I could hope for. Both people I was worried about, recuperating amid the bodies of their enemies.

Our pace slowed as I took in the scene. 2 bodies in the water, 1 floating face down, the other only visible by his hand reaching for rescue that never came. 3 more had been laid down on an islet. Their appearances suggested broken necks. Ilyim knelt by the waterside, washing his hands, and Matti was by his side, more or less. She saw us coming and put up her hand, telling us to wait.

I saw her speak to him, and he looked up at us, then back to washing. She shook her head and came to meet us.

“There you are. I’m sorry, we were waylaid.”

“Yeah, same for us. What happened?”

She glanced over her shoulder. “He broke the cardinal rule. By the time I dispatched the first pair with water magic, he had finished off his trio and had the last survivor disarmed. Pinned him up against the tree and threatened him thoroughly. I did not know what to make of it, and before I could do anything, he set the man down.

“The bandit tried to bolt, of course, but Ilyim caught him by the arm, claws extended. He said never to show his face again before letting go. He’s been washing his hands for a while now.”

I was letting her finish talking, but had my eyes firmly fixed on Ilyim, who was strolling up to us.

“All is as she said. I snapped their necks and let the last go.” We all turned to face him as he sniffed his hand. “Has the smell gone?”

Matti leaned forward and smelled. “No.”

“Then I shall go to my distant refuge and lay in the sun until the scent is scoured from my form.”

I gestured at him. “But why? Why would you do that? Our goal is eradication, but you let him go and forced yourself to stop?”

For once, Ilyim smiled. “Yes. For here, today, we have she who need not deny her senses, her nature.” He took Matti’s hand. “She who feeds on life and fear, shall be as a guide for the flame. Our foe flees to lick his wounds. Wounds that shall not heal by magic’s grace. No, he must go to his den, his flock, or die trying. Either way, his desperation will point you to your goal.”

He guided her hand to Hecate’s. “Go now, and let none survive.”

The angel promptly swiped her arm away. “And what of Dennis?”

“Yeah, what about me?”

Ilyim pointed to himself. “I have been exposed. It would be for the best that I am observed until I am somewhere safe.”

“Abso-” Hecate began, but I held out my arm.

“I’ll cast a spell that will teleport me here if I take too much damage. Then, if I don’t need it, I’ll meet you all back at the guest house, alright?”

My bodyguards shared a look. The seraph sighed, then snapped her fingers. My belt lamp lit with a candle flame. “Fine. By the graces of being in nearly the safest place in the world, whilst the vampire and I purge the greatest threat present. Do not mistake this for leniency. I am watching you.”

They were off shortly after I cast Backup Dance, and once Matti stopped snickering at my moves. 

Ilyim watched them go, perplexed. “It seems that you live within a cage of your own.”

“Don’t we all.”

“Indeed.” The sage mused for a moment. “Shall we travel, not as men, but together with the wind? Feel the breeze on our faces as we careen through the wilds?”

“Sounds fun. Lead the way.”

Come to think of it, I hadn’t cut loose and gone full speed in a casual setting for a long while. I bounced along islets and skipped across stepping stones of ice or wood. Ilyim kicked off trees and bounced with all his heart. It was nice, to just… be all we could be. An hour’s walk wore away into a few minutes. Ahead, a hill rose out of the water, with a great stone crown, climbing well above the canopy. Under its shadow, a little shelter.

We came to a stop at the base of the hill, and Ilyim sighed, but said nothing before strolling uphill, beckoning me to follow. As I walked beside him, he began to muse aloud.

“Do you fear me, for having smelt blood?”

“Some, I guess? For the taboo that it is, you seem pretty comfortable with it. Makes me think it’s not your first time. Or second. Fifth?”

We hooked around to the shelter. It was basic. The bed was more of a cot, and there were a few boxes of various things along with a very dead firepit. He reached into a box and found a root vegetable.

“It is but one of the many experiments we are subjected to. Underexposure, to see how we fare in a life so devoid of violence. It is a mistake. Among thousands that have been made, and will be made on our quest to be able to live at peace.”

He led me down to the waterside as he spoke, then whistled and sat down. “I am only a single step beyond the norm. I do not show the extreme reactions after years of non-exposure. The wizards, the doctors, they have yet to learn why, how. I am not the only one like this. Other villages have produced similar results, but I fear that I may die before I can be understood. A mistake is only so, if it cannot be learned from.”

He whistled again, and I saw a small critter swimming over. I elected to sit down beside him. 

“I’m curious why you’re suddenly all talkative with me.”

Ilyim glanced my way. “A troubled soul being open with another. And in due time, you shall depart, having shared this with no-one.”

A swamp rabbit clambered out of the water, shaking itself off and approaching Ilyim for the offered veggie. It held the snack in its paws and munched away. He watched it eat.

“Once, long ago, we were clay. An idea yet to be realized. The wizards who made us molded us into the shape they wanted, and baked us in fire. We emerged a hardened terracotta. The envy of the clay soldiers the world over. But our shape was not needed forever. The times of war ended, and we were the same shape.

“The clay soldiers let down their weapons and found other shapes to be. But we? We could only watch. A discarded tool, not worth maintaining. In turn, we became envious of the clay.” He fixed me with a serious look. “Countless marched into the furnaces to become as us, not understanding the price to be paid. But not you. The water’s flow carries only clay, and it brought you here.”

“That’s nice of you to say.”

He nodded at me. “I see in you that the temptation of the furnace was little, that you are still clay, flexible, who you want to be. Not the shape forced upon you by another. I would ask you to treasure it, and to spread this gospel, but I sense that you already do both.” Then, he paused to pet the rabbit. “I haven’t more to say.”

“Well alright then.” I stood up and brushed myself off. “That’s the best kind of quest, the type you’re already doing, or done. Unless you have any more ancient Hopper wisdom for me, I will leave you to your solitude.”

“Oh, no, this is quite new. Our ancient proverbs are far more direct.”

“Got a favorite?”

“It cannot hurt you if it is dead.” (Said with precisely 0 hesitation.)

……

I got back to the guest cabin around 1:30 pm, so I had a nice lunch. The wind was breathing down my neck for the audacity of being unaccompanied for any amount of time, which he only learned because I forgot he was waiting there for me. Whoopsie daisy, too bad, go whine to your manager. Hecate got back a bit after lunch, reappearing from the lamp via some form of teleportation. Matti followed 5 minutes later.

As it turns out, when the last survivor of a failed ambush comes stumbling into camp, almost everyone crowds around him to patch him up and hear what happened. That was still going on when the dynamic duo arrived, and, to paraphrase ever-so-slightly, Hecate said “I cast fireball” and everyone died. The end. Admittedly, there were a few more details, like sentries and whatnot, but you can assume what happened to them.

Matti killed 1, while Hecate fried the other 11, bringing the final score to: Hecate with 17 kills, Ilyim and Matti tied with 3 each, and me with a solid 0. Man, I really fell off since the 1000+ the day before yesterday. Or, however many I got that weren’t Pyroshir’s doing. Poor fella didn’t get his own count, now that I think about it.

Hecate did her little face-made-of-fire bit as the subject wound down. “Given the nature of our excursion, I decided to be thorough. I called upon a wheel for its divination skills, and it has informed me that there are no more bandits in this region.”

I gave her a weird look. “You couldn’t do that at the start?”

“And rob you of a well-earned victory? Hardly.”

Then she vanished before we could argue about it. Oh well. Back to work. I took my dishes to the wash basin.

“Alright. We speedran the bandit issue, so I think it’s time to take it easy. Matti, would you please find my bag of Golden Point equipment?” I scratched my chin. “Hmm, I’m gonna need to source some stuff locally.”

The requested ED sack hit the table with a thud. “There you go.”

“Thanks. I was thinking of doing some surveying first. Care to help out?”

Matti twiddled her thumbs. “Umm, actually, I was going to help get the smithy running again, now that the bandits are cleared.”

“Oh?”

“Yes. Also, Hecate… spat this up.” She held up a spiral of blackened metal. I raised an eyebrow in confusion, so she explained further. “Like a… a jester, pulling the neverending ribbon from his mouth. She said to give it to the smith. I could help you later, though.”

Both of us were quiet for a moment before the angel herself chimed in. “Why the alarm? It is merely recycling.”

……

You know, alone time? Not that bad. I’d gone without it for a while at that point, so it was a fresh feeling. I was going around, talking to people about their rat or similar issues, takin’ notes, makin’ plans. It was back to basics, gumshoe work, almost.

“Mr. Lawson? Mr. Lawson!”

*Hey, I recognize that voice,* I thought before turning around. A teenage Hopper, maybe 16-ish, came jogging up to me. She was a touch shorter than me, and adorned in striped gray/silver feathers. Big orange eyes too. I almost had a name to go with that face.

“You’re back! And have free time!” she hollered excitedly. “Remember me? Remember my proposal? My plan? Did it get approved?”

I held up my hand. “Whoa, there, first thing’s first.” I racked my brain for a second. “Ito?”

“Ite, ee-tay. Close enough. What about the plan?”

“Right, the plan. Your plan. The very important plan that I’ll definitely remember all of, just give me a sec…” I stalled, resuming the racking. “The plan you had… to open a Golden Point here… to hire locals… to service all the villages that don’t allow outsiders?”

“Yes! Is there good news?”

(  ) Yes

(  ) No

(X) Prefer not to answer

Man, her fists were all clenched in excitement and her nice blue signal feathers were standing up, anticipating my answer.

“Umm. I remember that I passed the proposal along to the company legal department and… I don’t think they ever got back to me on it.”

All that excitement—that anticipatory energy—vanished in a heartbeat. Her hands were at her sides, and her feathers were flat as a doormat.

“Oh. Okay.”

“But, I tell you what: It’s still a good idea, and I like it. When I get the chance, I will call the main office again and get that fire re-lit.”

“Okay.”

Her mood was not much better on hearing that, so I had to throw in the coup de grâce.

“Iiin the meantime, I have room for a tag-along, if you want to be my shadow.”

Ite’s face lit up. “Really? I can help this time?”

“Suuure. Your parents know what you’re up to?”

She gave me a defiant look. “Yes. But they said I’m old enough to make, and clean up after my own mistakes.”

“Great! Here.” I handed her my change of clothes. “Not as comfy as bare feathers, but a lot easier to wa-ash,” I finished in a singsong tone.

……

Man, what a kid she is. A real schemer, in a good way. I can’t say I’ve ever met someone who self motivates so hard out of pure hatred for the smell of rat droppings. I think she was 14 when she delivered a memorized speech to me about this whole Starsprout Grove branch for Golden Point idea.

We were halfway into trapping up the 2nd house when I started talking to her about the supply issues. Not knowing where I’d end up after Meridian Valley, I had packed up a wide variety of equipment, for all sorts of issues. It was vast as a lake, but deep as a puddle. I had a dozen glue traps tops, and a whole bunch of things that would probably spill blood, so we had to get creative.

Next thing I know, she’s dragging me to the shed behind her house to show me the workshop where she’d been refurbishing the glue traps I’d left behind last time. Girl was making copies too. Lawsuit! I kid. (She kid.) That was great. I jumped from 12% of the needed supplies, to 30%. About getting creative.

We ran down the list of everything I brought, scheming together like the gremlins we were. She stopped me from dismissing an herbal rat repellant. I thought it would be too offensive to Hopper noses, but she countered with “Better that, then rat”. So I let her sniff it, and, in her own words:

“Oh, that smells awful. It should work great!”

Of course, I had to remind her that other people might have differing opinions on it. So what does she do? Take the vial, run off to town square, ring the ballot bell, and call a vote on whether or not the repellant should be used to protect the granary. She caused a bit of a ruckus, marching up and down the raised announcements platform on one end of the square.

I was but a bystander, watching as she explained the pros and cons, then let the crowd smell the solution for themselves. Voting time came soon after. Yeas walked to the left, nays to the right. And just like that, the motion passed at a 4:1 ratio. Man, I really like the decentralized leadership those feathery fellows practice. It took 20 minutes tops.

On further consideration, this all points to Ite being a problem child by Hopper standards. She’s a little… militaristic for their evolving standards. However, I, too, have big problem child energy, so we resumed our quest of eradication. We set glue traps ‘til we were out, then we spread repellant ‘til that ran to half. Saved the rest for a 2nd application next month.

After that, we grabbed old, disused barrels and started turning them into bucket traps. We polished up some wood planks, varnished them to be nice and slick, and set them up on a hinge. Rat smells peanut butter, rat goes to end of plank, leverage makes plank dump rat into half-full barrel of water, rat drowns, plank resets. Rinse, repeat, rejoice. At that point, the sun was setting, so I gave Ite a high five and told her to go home for dinner.

She didn’t want to, of course, but I insisted and we split for the day. I walked home able to rest easy that night, knowing that the Hopper need to commit warcrimes and mass genocide were so solidly distilled into her, and entirely directed at rodents. It was a day well spent, and that put me in a happy mood as I marched back to the guest house.

I came through the door with a spring in my step, spotting Matti at the table looking pale… pale-er. She had a thousand yard stare.

“What?” I asked, feeling my happy balloon pop. “Did, uhh… someone die?”

“Sit,” she directed.

I shut the door and my mouth, taking the open seat to give her my full attention. She began.

“I made the call to check in about the magical items you sent. Analysis has concluded on several notable items.”

“Go on.”

“Between donning and doffing the protective suite, your equipment registered a number of spells being cast on you without your knowledge or consent. 7 charming or persuasion spells. 12 instances of telepathy. 8 divinations. 5 attempted scryings. And… tracking spells. 28 of them.”

She tapped the table. “All deflected. Currently, you are clean. But…” she trailed off.

“Do we know who cast them?”

“4 different sources. 2 have been identified. Both worked booths and used 1 charm each on you, and the latter of them also tried to read your mind to see if you were actually interested in the product. They’ve been taken in for questioning, but it looks like typical slimy commerce.”

“And the remaining pair?”

She shook her head. “We’ve got nothing. Most of the spells required line of sight too. They’re like ghosts.”

“Surveillance? Witnesses? The magic items didn’t see them?”

Matti shook her head for every question. “The investigation is ongoing, but the prospects are poor.” 

She sighed, bouncing her legs anxiously. The wind put a hand on her shoulder, which she held, until I scooched over and removed it, substituting my own.

“Hey, umm, you wanna… you wanna talk about it?”

It took a second, but Matti nodded. “May we have a moment? I want to talk to him in private,” she requested shakily.

There was an annoyed huff, which I understood for once. “I don’t think he’s allowed to step outside yet.”

“I have a solution,” Hecate interjected as she materialized.

The seraphim took the lamp off my belt and tossed it into the opposite corner of the house, then approached the wind… menacingly. “Come. They require privacy to profess their vulnerable thoughts.”

She backed the wind into the corner before scooping him up. “It’s not like you wanted to listen to their sappy confessions, right? Join me, I have a place to hide away.”

The wind was visibly struggling in her arms as she carried him over to the lamp. She was already shrinking into it as she spoke, dragging him along.

“I’m sure you’ll love it! I have been decorating it diligently. It is quite heavenly now. There ^(is so much we could do!)”

A full set of dragging claw marks drew lines along the floor as the seraph disappeared with her… guest. The lines converged at the spout. And then, it was quiet. Matti pinched the bridge of her nose.

“This was supposed to be a cushy job.” She sighed. “A little bit of spying. It happens all the time. Getting to know you was the cherry on top. Or maybe it was a carrot someone else dangled in front of me.”

“Probably. You're a bit too deep to turn back, though.”

She held her cheeks, sliding her hands down to her jaw. “Too deep indeed. I doubt I could take even you in a direct battle. But this… these people,” she thought for a moment. “It’s like 7 of you. I wouldn’t stand a chance, not even at night. Imagine they strike in broad daylight. I might as well not even be there.”

I reached out to pat her on the shoulder. “Hey, now. I’m sure you have plenty of tricks to fight during the day.”

“I have a relic that blots out the sun in an area.” She sniffled softly. “It takes 30 seconds from activation to effect. Do you think I’d last that long?”

The tears were coming on, so I moved in to hug her, and she reciprocated.

“That’s what the thermonuclear device is for.”

“I’m scared.”

*Damn. It’s officially past the point where joking helps.* I stroked her hair and let time pass us by.

“I’m scared too.”

……

The next morning was identical, yet utterly unlike the prior. Exhausted rest, punctuated by dull work had traded places with anxious, worried insomnia. My breakfast of Oatmeal with cranberries and pumpkin pie tasted like nothing. When Ulk came, doing the rounds, we followed quietly. 

The wind was introduced with little fanfare, and was barraged with questions for the sin of being the first case of invisibility seen in Starsprout Grove for centuries. (It doesn’t work, they see his vision cone.) In time, the consensus was that he was fine, so long as he remained close to me; a continuation of the status quo. So, we exercised. It was leg day, with situps too.

I was getting ready to get back to work when Ite found me. “You! Mr. Lawson, are you ready to continue our campaign?”

“Uh, yeah, sure. Let’s get on it.”

Ite was clearly confused by my tone. Her gaze snapped to Matti, who was doing some post-workout stretching. Then her head swiveled back to me.

“What’s the matter with you? Did she make you sad?” Ite asked with an accusatory point.

“No, no.” I gently pushed her hand down. “We received some bad news last night. She was the messenger, and you know what not to do with messengers.”

Her little bird brain ran through the list of idioms for a moment before she nodded with understanding. “Okay. Do you want to do something else before working? Something fun to distract?”

I shrugged. “I dunno. What does one do for fun around here.”

Ite raised a finger, then paused, then re-raised it. “Sling range?”

……

While I was open to the idea, Matti was genuinely excited. Go figure. She had enough fangirl in her to squeeze a mote of excitement out of the existential dread we were feeling. Honestly, good for her. The sling range was, well, quite a familiar design to me, a ‘proud’ American. A large, flat, open space, with a dirt berm on the opposite end of an open-walled pavilion. Targets, boxes of ammo, and lanes? All accounted for. It’s a rootin’, tootin’ shootin’ range.

At each lane was a table, and a reinforced canvas semi-tube to catch anything not slung forward. This chainmail-lined shot-stop hung from the ceiling halfway to the floor. Standing in the middle gave you a narrow view of the targets. It’s a lot of material, but it needs to be tough enough to catch everything. Well, judging by the smattering of patches, maybe not. 

An older hopper approached us, wearing light padding and a helmet. “How many lanes for you today?”

“A single lane will do,” Ite replied.

Her elder gestured us over to a vacant lane, which wasn’t hard as there were only 2 other guests at the time. We grabbed some slings off the rack and moved up to the table beside the protective tarp.

“How long is the range?” Matti asked, aghast at the distance to the furthest target.

“350 yards,” Ite answered casually. “No indirect fire.”

I opened up our Reming- wait, uhhhhhhhh Ram… ing… town? Sure. Ramingtown green-and-white box .85 cal lead slugs. They had a nice heft.

Ite went first while Matti and I practiced our sling form. I saw her bullets fly downrange and sink into various targets at the 100-yard line. The whirring of her sling got progressively louder as she upped the power to shoot for 150, and 200 yard targets. Her 15 shots (with 12 hits) were soon up, and it was my turn.

“Nice shooting,” I complimented in passing.

My aim was true, if I wanted to nail some guy’s dog. “Low, and left,” Ite called to my first shot at the 50 yard line.

“Low and left.”

“Closer. Still low and left.”

*Well, that’s a pattern,* I thought to myself before correcting.

“High and right.”

Correction: I over-corrected.

Then I scored a hit, and another.

“Good. Add force and aim for 75.”

Any guess what Ite said next?

“Low and left.”

I was able to hit the 100-yard target with my 2nd-to-last bullet.

“Good hit. Repeat it.”

I’d love to, but the last thing I wanted to hear was ‘low and left’ for the umpteenth time. I took the bullet in hand. It was time for a classic trick of mine. With a bit of magic, and that perfect flick of the wrist, I sent my bullet sailing for the fences. It whizzed past the 100, the 200, the 300, and *BOOM!* It nailed a target all the way in the back, shattering it.

“Whoa, those are pottery?”

“... Hit!” Ite called out after a long pause.

I stepped out only to be accosted. “How did you do that? I didn’t even hear you spin it up!” 

Ite was so frazzled that some of her feathers were standing up.

“I used a little magic.” I glanced to Matti. “How far was it from the Castle Sidia gatehouse to the woodline?”

“430 yards. The trees knew not to come any closer. Why?”

“So, yeah… I once threw some guy’s staff from the gatehouse all the way into the woods. Not to the edge, but well inside. What is that, 3-pound staff 500 yards? Boosted throwing can be a real neat way to spend some mana.”

Ite scowled. “No fair.”

“You, my friend,” I booped her nose. “Are not in a position to cry foul.”

She looked to Matti, hoping to have another on her side, only to be betrayed in the worst way.

“He’s right.”

Then it was Matti’s turn. She had the worst strength of us, but had far better accuracy than me. Midway through, Ite ran off, so I was responsible for calling the misses. I got to ‘low and left’ someone that day! Then, Ite got back right in time for her turn, and she had a much larger sling, made with proper materials. The range attendant was also in tow.

“What’s that for?”

“I really wanted to show you the snap!”

“The snap?”

“You’ll see.”

She then bowled past Matti as they traded places. I looked to the attendant for insight.

“Her enthusiasm is significant. As is this beam I will be standing behind.”

When in Rome…

The war sling had a much harsher screech as it spun up. The shrill droning was attention-grabbing as Ite spun up for a shot. She sent it downrange, not hitting anything.

“Come on. I can do it. I can make it snap.”

She spun up again, launched again.

“More power!”

Ite’s tone was getting a bit deranged as she repeated herself “Harder!”

Then came a distinctive *crack* as the bullet went downrange.

“Ooh, sonic boom,” I commented as the attendant whistled.

“That’s enough, young lady. You need to calm yourself now.”

Ite emerged with a big, toothy grin. “I did it!”

……

We returned to a more casual target shooting session. Matti, of course, regaled me on the history of Hopper slinger troops. It was a nice distraction from recent events as she told me the terrible impact on morale that the sonic boom had. I argued that a 2oz lead ball hitting you or someone next to you was much worse for morale than the sonic boom it made. And she countered that the actual worst thing for morale was the fact that it usually wasn’t lead shot, but explosive bullets.

Fair enough.

Then again, being exploded kinda removes morale from the equation, doesn’t it?

Our range session concluded and we broke for an early lunch. Ite showed us to one of the 3 restaurant-like places in town and if you guessed they were serving mito-mu meat then you win a prize! They served it with sweet and sour sauce and a side of steamed wild vegetables and grain. Best food I ever ate for free. (Moneyless society for the win.)

Ite and I had enough time during lunch to convince Matti to help us with the pest project. Beyond that point, the day was probably the best thing it could be - uneventful. Matti, Ite and I toiled away at the work set out for us. Traps were checked, produced, and placed. Stinky repellant was brewed and scattered as needed, and further plans were drawn for the future.

Come to think of it, Matti hadn’t seen a whole lot of the less glamorous side of the job. The oh-so-fun parts where you’re wading through billows of dust that is, in no small part, rat droppings. Times when you are tearing up floorboards and jumping at whatever makes a run for it. Though squeamish to common filth, she certainly had her highlights.

Matti shone at the toolshed incident. Ite and I were prying up the aforementioned floorboards when a handful of rats sprung forth and scattered. I netted 1, Ite dove and grabbed another (then ran off to drown it by hand). Matti, meanwhile, exercised her vampiric dominion over rats, because it never is *just* bats. With the shade of the building, she could flex her magic and give unto them a life drain. Wouldn’t you know, a combat spell tends to kill rats instantly. They fell over dead like they’d had a heart attack.

It’s a pretty neat trick, if you’re not standing in the AoE, which I was. But, in her own words: 

“You’ll live.”

I wouldn’t say the day flew by, but it didn’t drag either. Ite was a blessing, bringing us focus, and some levity as a bonus. I think she really grew on Matti too. They could plan world domination for hours, or something like that. I don’t actually know what the villain chicks talk about at their slumber parties. Honestly, I could put more of their burgeoning friendship to word, but it’s not really the central point, and I’ve been rambling for a while already.

Matti did say that she’d adopt Ite in a heartbeat, if the stars aligned. Probably as a henchman, and probably only a joke, but who knows.

Oh, and she said not to tell anyone she said that. Yup.

……

Around 5 pm, I stopped for a stone call. The timezones aligned for me to phone the Golden Point head office, and I wanted to make good on my word.

“Hello? … Hey, it’s Dennis. Employee #0001. Can you get legal on the horn? Thanks. … Hey, what’s up, Scott? … Yeah, that’s pretty nice. So, the reason I’m calling is that I’m back in Starsprout Grove, and I’ve been reminded of a little business proposal that I passed up the chain a while back. … 

“Well that’s not nice. I’ve got a very eager young lady over here who’s been champing at the bit to dole out some pesticidal justice. She pitched it to me year before last and if we don’t find some way to back her up, she’ll found her own pest control business, with blackjack and… uhh,” I looked at Ite, who was both pretty mature for 16, and sheltered to the point that I could not finish that reference.

 “You get the point. Dig up whatever you can from your research and get it together. I’m going to see if I can put you in touch with Ite directly, but the rules here are a mess, so it’s iffy. I’ll call you back at the same time tomorrow. Ok? … Great. Talk to you then. … Buh-bye.”

I ended the call with an exasperated sigh. Ite was waiting nearby for my explanation. “That was disappointing. They didn’t have all the legal texts to reference, and the file was buried by the time the copies arrived in the mail, so it didn’t get done.”

“But… they’re doing it now?” she inquired hopefully.

“They better be.” I rubbed my chin. “Say, who would I talk to about the rules for speaking with outsiders?”

Ite pursed her lips. “We usually defer to the lamias on issues of rules and leadership. I would ask them.”

I got up from the crate I’d been sitting on. “Alright, great. Y’all can finish up here. I have a side quest.”

I headed to the clinic and made it as far as the receptionist. Turns out, some of the books he reads are rulebooks! And no, Ite may not call outsiders on her own time. At least, not without a lengthy approval process with letters to the Hopper rehabilitation project leadership. However, if I wanted to provide any literature for her, I could do so. I was definitely carrying a great deal of relevant books. Yes. At least 1.

When I got back, Matti was rambling about… infantry tactics? I heard something about terrain manipulation and strategic funneling. Psychological stuff that I guess could inform how to place traps for rats. Ite perked up on seeing me.

“The calling is a bust. However,” I added, producing my employee handbook with a flourish. “I am allowed to give you this.”

I offered the worn, leather-bound tome to her, and she accepted it with reverence. “The… the CEO’s handbook?”

“It’s just a handbook,” I stated, before Matti flicked my temple and shot me a glare.

Ite sprung forward and hugged the air from my lungs. “Thankyouthankyou! I will memorize every word!”

“Aw, you don’t have to,” I wheezed out with the last of my breath.

A few more excited noises flew about as I was relinquished. Ite was spinning around like it was a particularly special ring of invisibility, or something of the like. Matti and I watched the antics from a safe distance.

“I didn’t think she’d like it that much,” I commented out of confusion.

“Of course she likes it. That is probably the closest that she will ever have to an army field manual.”

“Ohh…” I muttered as things started to click. “Should I sign it?”

……

I, in fact, did not sign it. The autograph of destiny would instead remain in my repertoire of rewards that I could dole out to Ite, should she continue down the path. I vowed to return with a wealth of knowledge that would serve her well, as the handbook was only half useful for dealing with pests. The other half being for an entirely different kind of pest that we—in the industry— call ‘clients’ and ‘legislators’.

The day wound down with dinner. I transmitted my apologies to Ite’s parents for sending her home caffeinated (sans coffee), and we headed to rest. Our moods were out of the dumps enough to weather the equally disappointing evening check in. To nobody’s shock, they hadn’t found anything, and the number of spells I’d bounced kept climbing. A nice, depressing little chaser to end the day.

We settled in for another night of sleep.

……

*Vwoom, Vwoom.*

…

*Vwoom, Vwoom.*

“Dennis. One of your bags is making a noise,” Matti complained blearily.

My eye crept open as I tried to sort out the faint noise from the echoes of a dream fading from my consciousness. *Vwoom, Vwoom,* it repeated. I sat up and rubbed my eyes.

“Hecate, which bag is it?”

The seraph appeared in a flash, standing among my luggage. At the repeat of the sound, she picked up the ED sack in question. After a moment of searching, and waiting for the noise again, she fished out a small wooden case. She opened it and peered around, before turning it to me.

“Recognize this?”

It was roughly the size of a fat notebook, with wooden exterior, and several cloth-lined pockets on the inside, not dissimilar to a portable jewelry box. Over half of the pockets held a tuning fork, and a label.

“Yeah, that’s my… house alarms. Give?”

Hecate handed me the case and I squinted at the sudden light in the room, courtesy of other people I wasn’t paying attention to.

“*Now* you want to work? Little late.”

I scanned the pockets, trying to make sense of the situation. Frankly, I didn’t even remember I had the stupid thing anymore. It didn’t work when the pros broke in. I had been carrying it largely because, well, I always carried it. I blinked, trying to see which fork was going off. Not ‘south window’ or ‘front door’ or anything labelled in plain English. But… *DT? What’s DT again? I haven’t touched this one in years.*

As the cogs turned in my brain, my mouth was one step ahead. “Drominnus tower?”

1na2kg5,https://i.redd.it/yjvxru65dknf1.jpeg,Hispanic Consumers Hit the Brakes as US Firms Sound the Alarm,"Bloomberg) -- One of the fastest-growing groups of US consumers is hitting the brakes.

What started a few months ago with makers of beer brands like Modelo warning of a pullback among Hispanic customers as anxiety about immigration raids and tariffs set in has now extended to other parts of the economy.

Consumption by Hispanic families barely rose in the year through June, according to research firm Numerator. Spending by White and Black households, meanwhile, continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace than seen in 2024.

 
 
Hispanics — who account for almost 20% of the US population — have been a key engine powering consumer spending during the pandemic recovery, but the group is starting to bend after years of price increases and a cooling labor market.

From restaurant chains like Jack in the Box Inc. to discount retailer Ross Stores Inc., a growing number of companies that rely on that group for a sizable part of their business have noted the pullback on recent earnings calls.

Hispanics as a whole earn less than the national average, and lower-income families — regardless of their ethnicity — have been struggling with higher costs of living.

“Hispanic households are experiencing disproportionate financial headwinds,” said Shawn Paustian, an analyst at Numerator. “These consumers can no longer absorb rising costs — many are compensating by trading down to lower-priced brands or purchasing smaller pack sizes to manage budgets.”

Raids Chilling Effect

President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants has also had a chilling effect — even among the majority of Hispanics who are either citizens or have legal status. 

“We are partying less, we’re gathering less, we’re using more delivery services, therefore we’re consuming less,” said Ana Valdez, president of the Latino Donor Collaborative, a nonprofit providing data and research on that community. “Latinos are feeling it and it’s impacting our consumption even if we’re completely, legitimately here.”

Constellation Brands Inc., the maker of Corona and Modelo, said this week that Hispanics, who make up about half of its beer customers, are buying less high-end beer than they used to. “Their shopping behavior has changed,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Newlands said at a conference.

GEN Restaurant Group Inc., a Korean BBQ chain, said it felt the impact from immigration enforcement in areas including California, Texas and Nevada where many customers and workers are Hispanic. 

Ross Dress For Less stores with a higher concentration of Hispanic consumers didn’t fare as well as other markets, the retailer said. And Jack in the Box, which also operates Mexican chain Del Taco, also singled out the pullback from Hispanic customers on an earnings call. 

Angel Leston, who owns two restaurants in Newark, New Jersey, says demand has gone down this year, in part due to broader economic uncertainty but mainly because of “fear looming in the air” amid immigration raids. 

“We always used to have tons of people walking through the streets at all times of the day. Now you’ll see it on a regular day and it’s almost empty,” said Leston, 38, who runs the Spanish restaurant Casa d’Paco. “The small business owners feel it, I feel it.”

President Trump is delivering on his mandate to enforce federal immigration law while growing the economy and tackling inflation, Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. “All Americans can feel confident the inflation from the Biden years is dropping and President Trump is pursuing policies that put American workers first.”

‘Terrible’ Economy

Overall, the pullback by Hispanic consumers mirrors that of lower-income households who are feeling the brunt of inflation. 

Four in five Hispanics say rising prices are making it harder to afford non-essential goods and services, higher than the US average, according to Numerator, which based its analysis on purchase data from more than 24,000 Hispanic households and a separate national survey with more than 1,660 respondents. Hispanics are also more likely to expect their financial conditions to worsen over the next year.

“The economy is terrible, specially food,” said Antonia Rivera, 58, a coffee-shop cashier who lives in the Miami neighborhood of Brickell. Rivera, who’s from Nicaragua, said she shifted to cheaper shops in a nearby neighborhood because the price of meats, cheeses and other goods has gone up so much at her grocery stores. 

Estefania Rosso, a 45 year-old domestic worker from Honduras, echoed her comments. “We’ve stopped buying some items and switched to others,” said Rosso, who lives with her son in Little Haiti, another Miami neighborhood. “And we don’t go to McDonald’s or fast food restaurants like we used to. I use that money to pay the electricity bill.”

 
 
The tighter budgets have benefited some brands offering discounted products.

“I know that investors have been concerned, understandably, about lower-income shoppers and about Hispanic shoppers,” Burlington Stores Inc. CEO Michael O’Sullivan said on a conference call. “Those shoppers are very important to us, and they’re very sensitive to economic headwinds such as inflation,” but the retailer isn’t “seeing any issues at this point.”

While Hispanic workers have the lowest median weekly wages of any of the major US demographic groups, the sheer size of the group means their spending habits has implications for the broader US economy.

The Census Bureau estimates the Hispanic or Latino population — which it defines as anyone from a Spanish-speaking culture or origin regardless of race — will surpass 66.5 million people this year and account for one in four US residents by 2050. 

That outsize growth has helped consumer spending among Latinos rise at an annual rate of 4.9% in the five years through 2023, more than double the pace among non-Latinos, according to a report by the Latino Donor Collaborative in partnership with Wells Fargo & Co.

“If the country catches a cold, we also get a cold — and pneumonia too,” said Patty Juarez, an executive vice president at Wells Fargo, who leads the bank’s Hispanic and Latino enterprise strategy. “We’re not immune to anything that happens. We’re part of this country, but I think our outsized contribution really has people paying attention.”",1,1757172884.0,TheTicker,0,1.0,False

After 20 years in Los Angeles, we’re beginning to wrap things up here and are looking to move up to Washington.  I’m a dog trainer and will only need to work part time.  My partner works for a Canadian CPG company and may be able to relocate thru work, or may need to find another role.  We absolutely do not want to be in the city- we are not leaving one city just to land in another one- but would like to be within an hour or so of the Seattle/Tacoma area for her job (she’s in the field 2-3 days a week which usually means mostly in or around the city.)

We have some time and will spend the next year or so checking out lots of different areas in Washington, but wondered what comes to mind for people more familiar with the area.   I’m trying to keep the requirements piece short to keep our options open but we will want:

1. Budget- i think we’ll rent first to make sure we’re happy with where we land. Rental budget probably around $4k/mo max.

2. LGBTQ friendly.  We are a gay couple, we’re not looking for pride parades but want to live openly without worrying about what people think, and would like to not be the only gay couple around.  

3. Nature (dog friendly nature is huge)- we’re coming off 20 years in a city and while we have some access to nature here in LA, it’s packed, there’s traffic to get there, dogs are often restricted or not allowed, and it’s unusable from July- October due to the heat. I don’t need to live in a forest or on a lake, but the idea of being able to walk my dog to one without having to navigate freeways and main roads would but the dream.

4. Someeee stuff to do- we’re not foodies, we’re not nightlife people…so it’s fine for us if we’re not in a trendy place.  But a couple coffee shops, local restaurants, farmers markets would be nice. 

I think that’s really it.  If anyone has the time to toss a few recs out to help us start our list, that’d be awesome. ",1,1757172878.0,SameGrassButGreener,8,1.0,False

But there are some solid ways to turn Sunday into a real reset day with proper Sunday wellness habits.

The best approach? Start with something genuinely enjoyable rather than forcing productivity. Maybe it's making pancakes from scratch, taking a long walk, or just sitting with coffee without checking emails. No agenda needed.

Here's the thing about relaxation - it doesn't always look like spa days and face masks. Sometimes, it's organizing your space while listening to a podcast, or meal prepping something you'll actually want to eat Tuesday at lunch. There's real satisfaction in having the week sorted ahead of time.

The biggest realization: self-care isn't always Instagram-worthy. Sometimes it's doing laundry so Monday morning runs smoother, or having that overdue conversation with your housemate about dishes. The unglamorous stuff counts too.

What Sunday rituals work best for you? Always curious about new ideas, especially ones that don't require special purchases or major time investments. Coffee-involved suggestions get bonus points.

Does anyone else notice Sunday evening anxiety hits differently now with remote and hybrid work schedules? The boundaries feel weird.

I’m 39, been on progesterone for roughly 6months. But in honestly I struggle to take it everyday. Thanks adhd. Been experiencing symptoms for 2ish years overall. I still have my period but the length is starting to vary pretty wildly. Last 3 cycles were 30day, 24 days and 40days. 

I’ve suffered from PMDD for since having kids in my early 30s. But it’s insane. I’m mid-cycle right now and this week I wrote 2 workbooks for an ebook I’m writing. Today I did laundry, loaded the dishwasher and thoroughly cleaned my entire main level. I slept well last night. I’m all prepped to do my garden canning this afternoon and I’m not feeling guilty for sitting with some hot coffee for a few minutes and I also don’t feel like taking a break will derail all of my motivation.  I also plan to finish organizing my homeschool materials and lessons which we start Monday.

Although may sarili akong bahay, I often visit my parents and stay with them during to keep them company kung wala akong lakwasta or trabaho, which is often the case dahil tamad na rin ako gumala sa weekends dahil sobrang traffic haha. And when I'm back home sa lugar namin, madalas din ako makipagkita sa mga old friends ko kapag natiempohan ko nandun din sila, and we meet up either at their place or at my parents', or sometimes sa mga old tambayan namin na mga kainan kung walang gana magluto haha, but this time sa bahay naman ng magulang ko kami ng hang out for some beers at light inuman at medyo in the mood din magluto ang mama ko at madami siyang nalutong ulam, so saktong environment for walwal haha.

So nung yun nga, nag light walwal kami ng iba kong friends sa bahay over ng kalahating kaha ng mucho ng Pulang Kabayo, all of whom matagal na ring kilala ng magulang ko at parang mga pamangkin na rin trato nila sa kanila. All of us are mga professionals na sa mga respective fields and most of whom ay pamilyado na rin, at dahil medyo busy kaming lahat sa career, family or both, once in a blue moon na lang kami nagkakasama at nagkakatiempohan sa hometown namin so we took advantage of the perfect situation. At dahil mga old HS friends kami for almost 20 years na, alam nating lahat mga tito at tita na hindi na maiiwasan yung mga reminiscing about nung HS days namin, including yung mga katarantaduhan namin noon. So one of the memories na nahalungkat namin is yung time na pinaulanan ko ng mga yung KSP namin na class president nung 3rd Year HS pa kami dahil nagpa-power trip siya na in hindsight we think ay dahil sa selos, and kaya rin siguro na-bring up yun kasi naging topic namin sa inuman ay si Shaira at yung kanta niyang Selos (catchy bwisit hahaha) haha.

One of my friends na present din sa inuman ay si EJ (33M), one of my oldest friends since childhood, and all of us, including EJ, bond over kanal humor at sa mga bungangang kanal namin. Ethnically Korean si EJ, but most of his life dito na siya sa Pilipinas lumaki at Pinoy at heart siya, and has even chosen to get naturalized in his teens. Equally fluent siya in Tagalog as well as Bisaya as he is in Korean, so seamless and native ang bungangang kanal niya haha. One thing about EJ is medyo pogi din siya, not enough para maging K-Drama idol or K-Pop band member, but enough to turn heads kung mag-effort siya na mag-ayos ng sarili as well as hindi siya aasarin na mukhang POGO employee kung naka dugyot mode naman siya, which is still true to this day kahit hardcore tito/ahjussi mode na rin siya like me. So nung HS kami, medyo considered din siya as a heartthrob at medyo madaming may crush sa kanya back then, lalo na't nauso nung panahon na yun yung K-Drama na Coffee Prince, at mukha pa naman siyang Temu version ni Gong Yoo pero humor ni Andrew E at bunganga ni Toni Fowler. Lalo siyang sumikat samin noon because of that K-Drama, even though ironically, walang alam sa K-Drama si EJ at puro DoTA at CS lang naman ng kokote niya noon like your typical HS boy back then and had no idea of even what Coffee Prince is.

Now on to the actual incident. One of his apparent admirers back then is yung aforementioned class president namin (no idea about her exact age haha but siguro roughly around 33 like me), who I'll refer to as Imelda, dahil may pagka-tyrant din siya noon pero medyo pretty and popular girl din siya noon so lagi siya naboboto pag class election, and apparently mahilig din siya sa K-Drama noon kaya siguro kay EJ siya dumiretso even though madami namang ibang pogi sa high school namin noon. Super obvious na may crush si Imelda kay EJ noon but he isn't interested, and nahalata namin yun kasi madalas niyang tarayan niya lagi yung mga female friends ni EJ for no reason and for some reason very possessive and flirty sa kanya, at minsan ginagamit pa niya yung kanyang authority para pahirapan yung buhay ng mga girls na kumakausap sa kanya even for casual and business reasons, which actually pissed off EJ a lot pero very good natured siya na tao and not very confrontational, so tinitiis na lang niya at hindi na siya pumapatol to cause a scene. At one point nung 3rd Year namin, nag-accept yung HS namin ng foreign exchange Korean students na talagang galing Korea, unlike ni EJ na dun lang pinanganak pero dito na talaga sa Pilipinas lumaki. One of those exchange students who was placed in me and EJ's class was a girl who I'd refer to as Fe (Fe for Foreign Exchange HAHAHAHAHAHA wala akong maisip na name sorry), and while good student naman siya overall, medyo nagsa-struggle siya sa Chemistry, maybe because of the language barrier than kasi medyo not up to par din yung English niya back then. Yung class adviser namin noon noticed na nahihirapan nga mag catch up si Fe, at nakisuyo siya kay EJ na turuan daw niya si Fe dahil nga wala silang language barrier at baka maturuan din niya mag English. While magkakilala naman silang dalawa, usually with other girls si Fe sumasama at si EJ kasama barkada namin so hindi sila close, pero no issue naman kay EJ tulungan siya. Problema lang hindi niya ganun ka-kursunado ang Chem back then, so tinanong niya ako kung willing ko ba siya tulungan turuan si Fe, ako daw mag-explain tapos siya daw translator at sakto daw para sabay maturuan ko din daw siya kasi nahihirapan din daw siya, to which sabi ko sige no problem basta payag si adviser at pumayag naman. So tuwing free time namin or walang teacher na period, ayun nga tinuturuan ko silang dalawa ng Chem tapos si EJ nagta-translate kay Fe ng mga tinuturo ko from English into Korean kung hindi niya mahabol. Uso pa English campaign nun, so yun nga tinatry namin sumunod para hindi kami masita, lalo na't napaka despota pa naman ni Imelda at mahilig mag power trip, lalo na't nagpaparamdam nanaman ang selos niya kasi lagi naming kasama si Fe recently, likely made worse na fellow Korean pa siya tulad ni EJ, pero hindi niya kami masita kasi utos nga ng adviser itong ginagawa namin. Pero nung dumating na sa topic ng weak acids and bases na medyo complicated pero kursunada ko naman, nahihirapan ako mag-explain in English ng maayos both kay EJ at Fe, and with both my adviser's and English teacher's permission, pinayagan niya ako i-exempt sa English campaign na yan habang tinuturan ko sila para nga ma-explain ko ng ayos in Tagalog tapos i-translate na lang ni EJ kay Fe in Korean, which he says na kaya naman daw niya. Problema lang, hindi alam ni Imelda yung arrangement namin na exempt muna kami sa English campaign during these lessons, at sinisita niya kami ng paulit-ulit during these lessons nung narinig niya ako nagta-Tagalog, which is ironic since hindi naman ganun ka-ganda English ni Imelda and only slightly better kay Fe. Nung una hinahayaan na lang namin pero nung paulit-ulit na niya kaming hina-harass at halatang sobrang uncomfortable na si Fe kasi sinisigawan na rin niya kami in front of everyone at medyo paiyak na siya, and while si EJ halatang napipika na, nauna ako magsnap sa kanya and from what I can still recall after all these so hindi ito exactly verbatim, this is how my outburst basically went:

Imelda (pasigaw kahit nasa harap niya lang kami): Speak in English! Follow the English Campaign!

Me: Putang ina ka, kanina ka pa putak ng putak, nakakarindi ka na. Puro ka dada at puro payabang, habang kaming nanahimik dito at talagang may ginagawang maayos yung pinili mong iligalig dahil nagta-Tagalog lang kami, pero wala kang pakialam na parang mga hayop na nakawala sa hawla yung mga iba nating kaklase? Wala ka bang ibang magawa sa buhay kundi magpapansin?

Imelda (medyo paiyak na): What did you said to me?! I said you should speaking in English! (Eto lang yung verbatim na sure ako dahil hanggang ngayon tawang tawa pa rin ako irony sa alanganin niyang English)

EJ: Hoy parekoy, kalma lang, wag mo nang patulan yung papansin na to.

Me: Ilang araw na niya tayong rinaratrat dahil lang sa putang inang English campaign na sobrang mahal niya, e hindi naman siya marunong ng tamang English. Putang ina niya, masgaling pa tayong dalawa mag English sa kanya pero binabatbat pa rin niya satin yung English niyang butas-butas. Halatang nakikisawsaw kasi walang ibang maisip na gawin.

Imelda: Ano sabi mo?! Ulitin mo yan sa mukha ko sige!

EJ: Hala galit na, ikaw na bahala diyan parekoy, moral support na lang ako dito ha?

Me: Aba, yung hipokrita nag Tagalog na kasi wala nang ibang alam na maayos na English? Sige pakitaan kita ng English na maayos. Since you've been acting so high and mighty towards everyone just because of some English Campaign you've been asked to enforce, and you probably think you're the queen of the world just because you were voted as Class President, why don't you prove to everyone how amazing you actually are and teach Chemistry to Fe in English yourself, you despot bitch?

Imelda: Putang ina mo OP! Sumusunod lang naman ako sa English Campaign!

EJ, lumalabas na ang kanal humor: Damn pare ang brutal mo masyado. Pero alam mo kung ano tawag sa Korea sa mga katulad mo, Imelda? Shibal (napa ""OMG"" face si Fe dito). Balita ko mahilig ka daw sa Koreanovela (yung tawag sa K-Drama noon) kaya baka alam mo na siguro kung ano ibig sabihin nun. Tapos halata pang may maluwag kang tornilyo sa utak, so siguro dapat ""Shibaliw"" na lang itawag ko sayo kasi nakakairita ka na nga, buang ka pa.

Imelda: Putang ina niyo! Bahala kayo diyan! (sabay walk out at iyak papunta sa mga barkada bitches niya)

Hindi ko pa actually alam nun at the time, pero yun pala sobrang palakol pala mga grades ni Imelda sa Chem noon, so medyo naging inadvertent low blow din pala yung sinabi ko bukod dun sa English niya haha.

So ito nga, nung nag reminisce kami tungkol dun sa incident na yan, at sobrang pinagtatawanan namin si Imelda noon, na-overhear ni Mama lahat pero hindi siya nag-react during the light walwal session namin. Pero nung nakauwi na lahat at naglilinis na ako ng mga pinagkainan namin at naghuhugas ng plato at baso, bigla akong kinausap ni Mama at sinabi niya na while matagal na nga since nangyari yun, sobrang horrible pa rin daw ng sinabi ko kay Imelda as well as uncalled for, even though she understood why I snapped. Tapos yun pala, anak pala si Imelda ng isa niyang kaibigan, and apparently, she isn't doing too well right now kasi walang trabaho asawa niya ngayon at housewife siya na may tatlong anak na inaalagaan kaya hindi maganda situation niya right now, so maybe wag muna namin ulit pagtawanan si Imelda like that even though matagal na yun nangyari and we're just laughing at a memory now instead of at her. The revelation actually made me feel really bad for laughing at that memory since then and the remorse even sobered me up immediately dahil may amats pa ako nun nung naghuhugas ako ng pinggan.

Tinext ko rin later si EJ about what I learned galing kay Mama tungkol sa situation ni Imelda right now, and said that I really felt bad about us laughing at her nung inuman namin even if I didn't know back then how she's doing now, and while he did feel bad din nung nalaman din niya about her current situation (first time din niya nalaman about it), he said that we weren't laughing at her situation now and that yung memory lang naman yung pinagtatawanan namin, and that like the rest of us, he's sure na nag mature na si Imelda by now after all these years, and has likely changed to be a different and better person now from the unreasonable tyrant she was back then, even though we haven't kept in touch with her, so we aren't mocking her as who she is now and while it's sad that yun nga, she's currently going thru a rough patch, we never wished that on Imelda and it wasn't as if tayo yung nagpapahirap sa kanya nor are we aren't exactly reveling in schadenfraude in her current rough patch either, pero yun din, agree din siya kay Mama na wag muna pagtawanan si Imelda, even our memory of her, for the time being and continuing to do so would just leave a bad taste in our mouths lalo na't alam na namin yung current situation niya.

Despite EJ's assurances and Mama telling me that it's a good thing na pinagsisihan ko na pagtawanan si Imelda even though I didn't know what she's going through right now when I did, I still feel very horrible and that I was basically kicking a person when she's down and vulnerable. Napapaisip din ako recently whether sobrang naging harsh din ako sa kay Imelda back then at naging matapobre din ako noon dahil masmagaling ako mag-English sa kanya, and whether I lost my temper over something that shouldn't have been worth exploding over and unnecessarily made someone feel like crap. I know as a fact that I have a tendency to be extremely verbally brutal when my buttons are pushed and my patience had been tested to its limits, pero I always regret yung sinasabi ko even though other people often say na tama lang yung sinabi ko and they had it coming although some do add na medyo overkill ako at times.

Sorry kung medyo mahaba, but this has been weighing on my conscience ever since sinabi ni Mama sakin yung situation ni Imelda. Pero hindi ko actually alam kung mali ba ako or hindi, and whether I should start working to be a better person dahil ang gago ko talaga or that I'm kicking myself for nothing.

1na2ind,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wide-Veterinarian373/comments/1na2ind/how_to_upgrade_your_sleep_heres_some_things_to/,How to Upgrade Your Sleep: Here’s Some Things to Change,"I think a lot of people (me included) assume that bad sleep is just part of life stress, screens, too much coffee, whatever. And yeah, that’s part of it. But your actual sleep setup plays a way bigger role than most of us realize.

If you're waking up tired, sore, or just not rested, it might not be you, it might be your bed quietly ruining your life. Here’s a breakdown of the main things I’ve found are worth rethinking if you're trying to actually feel rested when you wake up.

**1. Mattress: Your Foundation Is Probably Lying to You**

If your mattress is more than 7–10 years old, sags in the middle, or makes your back sore? That’s your first red flag. You don’t have to go luxury but you do need something that supports your spine and doesn’t overheat.

**Why it matters:** Your spine alignment during sleep affects everything back pain, shoulder tension, even how deeply you stay asleep.

**Options to check out:**

* **Zinus Green Tea**: budget memory foam option that works surprisingly well if you're upgrading from an old spring mattress.  
* **EGO White Memory Foam Mattress:** good mid range pick that doesn’t trap heat and has a balanced, medium firm feel.  
* **Avocado Green**: if you want something more eco conscious with natural latex.  

# 2. Pillow: The Unsung Hero of Neck Pain (or Relief)

The pillow you sleep on affects your neck, shoulders, and even jaw. If your pillow goes flat, bunches up, or forces your head into a weird angle, it’s going to mess with your sleep no matter how good your mattress is.

**Why it matters:** Proper neck alignment = deeper sleep, fewer headaches, and not waking up feeling like you got hit with a frying pan.

**One that gets recommended a lot:**[ **Honeydew Classic Scrumptious Pillow**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MGCVWH9?maas=maas_adg_api_586192876039819819_static_9_129&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&aa_campaignid=lv_eX192MQmlqpjKHnchG&aa_adgroupid=lv_dzP8CG41MjBqQMIonM&aa_creativeid=lv_D9kZNFZD7HnGGfxa4h&m=AKJPZBMAK64Z6&th=1) : This one comes up constantly in sleep threads, and for good reason. It’s designed specifically with back and stomach sleepers in mind, which already narrows the field (most pillows tend to favor side sleepers). The fill is a cooling copper gel blend, and what makes it stand out is that it’s fully adjustable you can remove or shift the fill to get the height just right for your neck and sleeping position.It’s not cheap but people who’ve tried a bunch of options and still struggle with neck pain or waking up uncomfortable tend to land on this one as a long term fix. The shape is also slightly curved which helps keep your head and spine aligned if you sleep flat or switch positions during the night. Doesn’t hurt that it comes with a matching pillowcase that actually fits it properly too (rarely the case with oddly shaped pillows). (linked it cos its from a small business so you might have trouble finding it)

**3. Bedding & Sheets: Breathability Over Thread Count**

You don’t need 1,000 thread count sheets. You do need sheets that let your body breathe and regulate heat. If you wake up sweaty or tangled, it’s probably not just you your sheets may be trapping heat or sticking too much.

**Why it matters:** Your body needs to cool slightly to enter deep sleep. Overheating literally pulls you out of it.

**Things that work well:**

* **Brooklinen Classic Percale Sheets**: crisp, breathable  
* **Quince Linen Sheets**: slightly more textured, good airflow  

# 4. Duvet/Comforter: Heavier Isn’t Always Better

Lots of people use thick duvets or comforters that are better suited to winter camping than actual sleep. Look for something temperature regulating and seasonally appropriate.

**Why it matters:** Like sheets, your comforter plays a huge role in whether you overheat or sleep comfortably through the night.

**Popular picks:**

* **Buffy Breeze**: lightweight and cooling  
* **Down Alternative Comforter by Utopia**: budget-friendly and washable  
* **Weighted blanket** : not for everyone, but some people swear by it for calming anxiety and improving sleep quality  

**5. Mattress Topper (If You’re Not Replacing the Whole Mattress)**

If a new mattress isn’t in the budget, a topper can actually make a big difference in support and comfort especially if your current mattress is too firm or too soft.

**Why it matters:** It's the fastest fix if your bed is actively working against you.

**Solid options:**

* **Viscosoft Foam Topper**: adds plushness and reduces pressure  
* **Lucid lavender Infused Topper**: budget-friendly with cooling features  

**Final Thoughts**

None of these things are magic fixes on their own, but they add up. If you’ve never paid attention to your bedding setup before, starting with any one of these can make a bigger difference than you’d expect. I didn’t think I’d care about sleep gear now. I kind of want to give my past self a shake for just accepting bad sleep for so long.

Hope this helps anyone else in the “why am I still tired?” camp.

After 20 years in Los Angeles, we’re beginning to wrap things up here and are looking to move up to Washington.  I’m a dog trainer and will only need to work part time.  My partner works for a Canadian CPG company and may be able to relocate thru work, or may need to find another role.  We absolutely do not want to be in the city- we are not leaving the city just to land in another one- but would like to be within an hour of the Seattle/Tacoma area for her job (she’s in the field 2-3 days a week which usually means mostly in or around the city.)

We have some time and will spend the next year or so checking out lots of different areas in Washington, but wondered what comes to mind for people more familiar with the area.   I’m trying to keep the requirements piece short to keep our options open but we will want:

1. Budget- i think we’ll rent first to make sure we’re happy with where we land. Rental budget probably around $4k/mo max.

2. LGBTQ friendly.  We are a gay couple, we’re not looking for pride parades but want to live openly without worrying about what people think, and would like to not be the only gay couple around.  

3. Nature (dog friendly nature is huge)- we’re coming off 20 years in a city and while we have some access to nature here in LA, it’s packed, there’s traffic to get there, and it’s unusable from July- October due to the heat. I don’t need to live in a forest or on a lake, but the idea of being able to walk my dog to one without having to navigate freeways and main roads would but the dream.

4. Someeee stuff to do- we’re not foodies, we’re not nightlife people…so it’s fine for us if we’re not in a trendy place.  But a couple coffee shops, local restaurants, farmers markets would be nice. 

I think that’s really it.  If anyone has the time to toss a few recs out to help us start our list, that’d be awesome. ",0,1757172720.0,PacificNorthwest,9,0.25,False

What shocked me most was someone literally showing the reporter how easy it is to evade the fare—on camera, with his name publicly shown. At that point, shouldn’t he be the first person to get a citation? 😂

I’m tired of the college student excuse of “I don’t need to pay because I’m a student.” I was a student last year. I commuted to Northeastern, paid $232/month for the T, and worked full time. A friend commuting from Lowell was paying over $500/month. Meanwhile, many friends who lived on campus, wealthy internationals with money to burn—still acted like $2.40 for a train ride was some unbearable burden. They’d complain about the fare while holding an $8 iced coffee.

Universities need to step in. If you’re a student who gets cited for fare evasion, it should be treated like an academic infraction. Make them meet with the Dean, and pay a fine. Period. The system only works if everyone pays. For locals and commuters, the cost is already high. Watching people with plenty of money cry poor while stealing service is insulting.
Fare evasion is theft. Full stop. It’s not quirky, it’s not a student rite of passage—it’s stealing. And it shifts the cost burden onto the rest of us who actually pay.

The day after we broke up he literally took me on a date, kissed me, help my hand, everything. He said we broke up because we fight too much and he had to walk on eggshells around me but on my side it seemed he did not like the boundaries i put in place relating to going to girls houses on campus. We had a whole conversation about how we wanted to work on our selves individually to hopefully come back to each other he even told me he wasnt going to date anyone (which he hasn't but who knows). He wanted to keep each others locations and social medias followed, and our pictures up still on social media and wanted to be friends. A few days after we broke up him and i bumped into eachother at a coffee shop we usually study at and he asked me to sit with him. While we were sitting he was touching my face with his IPad pen and put his leg up on my chair and his other foot on my foot. As I was leaving I went to dap him up and he just held my hand and looked at me. After that, that sunday we all went to church in our group because not many people knew we broke up and he didnt want anyone to know for some reason (I ended up having to tell the group) and during Mass he held my hand and hugged me like it was nothing. After church we went to eat and he came and opened my door for me in my car and put his hand down my back. After that I told him I was confused and wanted to take our location off because this felt like more than what he wanted to be: friends. A week or so later he texted me asking to take the pictures down and respectively i did BUT i asked why he wanted to keep them up in the first place and he said he thought I wanted to and I told him that I thought he wanted to because he was the one that asked to. He ended up saying that the conversation we had the day after we broke up about getting back together had no reason to it and it wasnt in his plans right now to get back together at all but he ""still would want that to happen"". I decided it was best we unfollow eacother to clear all confusion and he unfollowed me on everything except tiktok until this morning. The last thing he said to me over text was ""you dont wanna be friends?"" and i told him no. Last week was the week of welcome fair at our university and I had to retrieve something from insdie the main building. As I was walking there all I heard was ""Hey, you know they have free shirts and food here!"" it was him.. why was he talking to me still? Its so confusing. Recently his sister and I decided to go see the new Conjuring and he got wind of this. He asked her what day and time we were going and she told him not to worry about it. Earlier that day she sent a picture of me into their family group chat working out at school (his family still loves me and even offered to take me with them on a trip but i had to decline out of respect for my ex.) he responded instantly and have in mind he NEVER text in that gc.

I’m F/15 and been struggling with dizziness, nausea, heavy nose bleeding, heavy periods, racing and pounding heart and stuff like that for YEARS now.

For more information; I’m diagnosed with depression and anxiety, been seeing a therapist for almost three years and struggle with things like dizziness, constant fatigue, nausea (but no actual puking) and I even fainted one time when I was ten.
After I fainted, we (of course) went to a hospital and I stayed there for a few days.
They hooked me to an IV and told me to rest (I was also on my period at that time, so doctors of course blamed it on that.)
EVERY (adult) person I tell this to tells me it’s either because I’m laying in my bed all day (I don’t.), I’m not drinking enough (I do), or they tell me to just drink an espresso in the morning because; “I had that too when I was your age! I just started to drink coffee and I was healed!!😍”.
I’ve tried literally so many things; coffee, energy drinks, a completely healthy diet, a shitty diet, eating meat, not eating meat (I’m currently vegetarian), cutting sugar, eating a LOT of sugar, playing sports, going out at least 4 times a week..
NOTHING helps! I just went on a class trip last week and I literally needed to sit down for at least half an hour during our free time in the city because I was dizzy or nauseous! (And that was MULTIPLE times a day!)
I already told my parents this but they brush it off as “being lazy”, “it’s your depression”, “it’s normal, you’re going through puberty”, “every girl your age has that”, etc, etc.
I know that it’s always stupid to google your symptoms, but I was just tired pf it at one point so I started googling and searching for answers.
I stumbled across an illness that’s called “pots” and I did a little research on it.
Long story short, I relate to pretty much every symptom they list off on those websites but I don’t have any possibility to actually see a doctor right now because no one believes me or cares enough about my symptoms to take me to see one. (I’m also to anxious to go alone. Fml)
I do NOT mean to offend anyone struggling with a disability with this post but can someone maybe help me how to get rid of the symptoms? Like the REAL stuff that helps with the symptoms you experience (even if you have another disability with those symptoms, I’ll take any help at this point!)

Like, every time this discussion comes up, I'm surprised by how many people create long arguments, complain, and try to go back 30 years in the history of yaoi and mlm, when in 99% of cases the answer is so simple: people write men this way because it turns them on.

They don't want to write about women; they're not turned on by women. They're turned on by *men* who have these behaviors and wear dresses.

""but this character doesn't canonically behave like that"" they are also canonically not gay, they don't look like they came out from a  bara manga, they are not an alpha and vampire and they don't work in a coffee shop. But more importantly: this character doesn't exist. And while he's your favorite, he's not just yours. He's a public toy. If you can't accept that,  you are the one who should start writing original stories about your OCs.

""people should at least tag this"" people should tag as much as ao3 says, everything else is just politeness (but also yes, I look at you, some people on this subreddit who saying that feminization/ukefication/whatever should be tagged, but then in the next post they argue that they will never tag top/bottom even if their fanfic is pure smut without a plot)

""but real gays-"" strange, I thought we all agreed that fiction and reality are not always the same and you can fantasize about something without harassing real people

""But 30 years ago in yaoi."" But we're not 30 years ago. Media has changed, you have more diversity now. If you can't find anything that fits your version of gay, well, that's skill issues on your site.

""But I want more masculine men in fanfiction, not in other media,"" so write it yourself.

""But I'm already writing,"" so write more.

""criticism of trends is important and-"" sir, this is fanfiction. You don't get a gold star for being progressive because you claimed a bunch of amateurs write porn in a way that make theirs dicks hard, but not yours

""the point is that women are having fun and-"" you literally don't even know who the author is, and if you think you do - you have a bigger problem than this fanfiction

""okay, but I can just say I don't like something and there's too much of it in my fandom"" you wrote a comment that could already count as a drabble or a one shot and then you spent time making a meme, that goes beyond a simple ""I don't like it""

Just roasted another batch of one of [my favorite beans](https://roastrebels.com/en/costa-rica-anaerobic-tarrazu/) (this thing tastes and smells like apple pie), and everything clicked! Great espresso roast profile I've been tuning for a while.

TLDR:

1. Charge temp slightly above other naturals (200c);
2. Low fan and moderate heat (70%) during dry.
3. At dry end, bump fan to moderate and slightly lower the heat by 10%.
4. At 170c start backing off heat  5% each minute.
5. 45s before first crack crank up the fan to high (75% for me).
6. For a \~15% weight loss and \~23% dev pct end around +11c/+2:45m after 1st crack.

The smell of apple pie was through the roof. If you like a sweet and acid apple pie taste, you need to try this coffee! Other beans from Roast Rebel are also great! Check them out: [https://roastrebels.com/en/green-coffee/](https://roastrebels.com/en/green-coffee/)

              🧡Thoughts about the bag🧡

Okay, so the YSL Jamie Small Shopping Bag is basically my “cool mom” sidekick. It’s soft and squishy lambskin but somehow still holds it together better than I do on a Monday morning. The quilting makes it look super chic, and the chain straps are giving “effortlessly put together” even when I’m in leggings with a juice box stain somewhere on me. It fits all the mom life essentials like my wallet, snacks, wipes, soccer cleats, and yes, my iced coffee. The little removable pouch inside keeps my keys and chapstick from disappearing into the black hole of mom bags, which feels like luxury on its own. It’s lightweight, easy to carry, and just the right size so I don’t feel like I’m dragging around a mini suitcase. Honestly, it’s the kind of bag that makes me feel a little fancier running errands, like maybe I do have my life together. Spoiler: I don’t, but the Jamie makes it look like I do. 😆🖤🫰🏽

              🧡Thoughts about the factory🧡

Okay yall, storytime! This was my very first order from Jundu, also known as Orange Sofa YSL, and I was way too excited about it. I went full detective mode last year, doing a deep dive into YSL factories, and I kept seeing Jundu pop up as the go to spot back in the day before they got raided and shut down. Fast forward to now, and guess who’s back in business. Their bag selection is still kind of limited right now, but I couldn’t resist testing them out. So I went with the Jamie, and yall, the leather is giving Black Frame vibes, maybe even softer, which I did not expect. The stitching is flawless, the craftsmanship is chef’s kiss, and the hardware is nice and weighty with that crisp little logo engraving. And yes, the very first thing I did was sniff it, because apparently I’m a proud leather sniffing weirdo, but I’m happy to report it passed with flying colors. Honestly, I’m already planning my next order because I need to compare more styles, but so far Jundu is looking really promising. 🏭👩🏽‍🔬🍊

I’ve already got three more bags on the way and I’m literally chatting with her right now about another order. Someone take my phone away because I cannot stop. 💯💯💯

I told myself I wouldn’t get mad.

It was just a fork. A single fork. In the sink. Again.

I stood there, staring at it like it had personally insulted my entire bloodline. My roommate, Sarah, walked past me with her usual air of innocent chaos, grabbed her iced coffee from the fridge, and hummed her way back to her room.

I followed her.

“Hey,” I said, as casually as I could, which was not casual at all. “Did you forget to wash your fork?”

She blinked. “What fork?”

What fork?
THE fork.

“The one in the sink. The only one. The one I cleaned the whole kitchen around so it would stand out like a crime scene clue.”

“Oh, yeah. I was gonna get to it.”

She shut her door.

I stared at the closed door for a full ten seconds. I went back to the kitchen, picked up the fork like it was radioactive, and washed it. It took four seconds.

That’s when I spiraled.

Is it really just about the fork? Or is it about every time I’ve done the dishes while she’s left “just one more thing” until there’s a mountain of crusted-over utensils? Or the way she never replaces the toilet paper roll? Or how she borrows my oat milk and then claims, “It’s communal, right?”

I called my best friend. “Am I overreacting?”

She paused. “About the fork?”

“Yes.”

“Well… kind of. But also no. Because it’s not about the fork. It’s about the fork every single day.”

I exhaled.

Maybe I was overreacting. But also? Maybe I was underreacting for weeks. And today was just… fork day.

1na249c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1na249c/does_apec_water_filter_set_really_deliver_an/,Does APEC Water Filter Set Really Deliver? An In-Depth Review,"The **APEC Water Systems ULTIMATE Series FILTER-SET FILTER-SET** has been an integral part of my kitchen setup for a few months now. Being someone obsessed with clean water and the longevity of reverse osmosis (RO) systems, I was intrigued to test this filter set. Many claim it provides superior filtration while extending the life of your undersink system — but does it? Here's how it performed during my daily use.

**Ease of Installation**

Setting this filter set up was straightforward, even for someone like me who isn’t exactly a plumbing expert. The detailed instructions included in the package made the process incredibly smooth. Compatible with models like RO-45, RO-90, and RO-PH90, it worked seamlessly with my existing reverse osmosis setup. Bonus points for it fitting all standard-sized under-counter reverse osmosis systems! Swapping out the old filters with the new ones took me less than 30 minutes, and I didn’t need any special tools besides my usual kitchen wrenches.

[Check APEC Water Systems ULTIMATE Series FILTER-SET price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00hv128wy/)

**Filtration Capability and Water Quality**

The real magic of this filter set lies in its three-stage filtration system. The first stage uses a high-capacity polypropylene sediment filter that eradicates dust, particles, and rust like a pro. Trust me, there was a visible difference in water clarity just after this stage. The second and third stages are where the premium extruded carbon block filters shine — they remove chlorine, strange odors, and that peculiar taste lingering in the water. My coffee tasted cleaner, and I also noticed an improvement in the flavor of soup broths. Additionally, the filter’s ability to target VOCs and impurities gave me peace of mind about what my family’s drinking.

**Build Quality and Design**

It's safe to say that every inch of this filter set reflects a focus on quality. Made in the USA, the materials — carbon and polypropylene — boast durability and high performance. Weighing 2 pounds and sized at 9.3""D x 11.5""W x 4.8""H, it fit snugly under my kitchen sink without occupying too much space. The compact design works great if you’re short on storage below your counters, and the white color blends with typical undersink equipment, so it doesn’t look out of place.

**Good Aspects**

- High-grade polypropylene helps in efficiently filtering particles and rust.
- Extruded carbon block filters bring noticeable improvements in taste and odor.
- Durable material ensures a longer lifespan (tested for over 12 months).
- Relatively easy-to-follow installation instructions.
- Compatible with multiple APEC RO systems and standard setups.

**Areas for Improvement**

- No quick-connect fittings included could result in an extra purchase.
- I noticed a slight initial flow rate drop after installation — it took some flushing to stabilize.
- Felt the price point might be slightly higher than similar generic brands.

**Performance Over Time**

After several months, there’s been no sign of degradation in filtration efficiency, and the filters indeed live up to the claims of lasting over 12 months. While I’ve been careful with maintenance, like periodic system flushing, this filter set has slightly reduced the frequency of required filter replacements compared to my previous one. It's a blessing because fewer replacements mean less hassle.

**Competing Products**

Before settling on this pack, I considered similar models such as iSpring and Express Water filter sets. Both offer decent filtration but often fall slightly short in sediment removal. For instance, iSpring’s sediment filters tend to clog faster, while Express Water’s carbon block sometimes leaves fine particles in the system. In contrast, this filter set demonstrated superior dirt-holding capacity and true uniformity in its carbon core. GAC filters from competing brands often suffered from uneven filtration, whereas APEC’s design eliminates that issue entirely.

**Value for Money**

When evaluating cost efficiency, this filter set justifies its price tag thanks to its exceptional filtration power and durability. While a bit more expensive upfront than generic brands, the extended lifespan significantly lowers replacement frequency, ultimately saving money. If safeguarding your family’s health with top-notch water filtration is a priority, this pack is undoubtedly worth investing in.

Anyway, after our session, my brain was so confused, and I felt like it was trying to convince myself none of the traumatic experience ever happened and that I was making it all up for whatever reason (I’m crazy, I’m purposely lying about stuff to blame them for my issues, etc). I knew logistically it did happen, but I just felt so confused. I know this is probably a coping response. Has anyone else experienced this? I was off for the rest of the day Thursday, but now I feel fine. I think the caffeine contributed to this a little bit. ",4,1757171766.0,EMDR,2,1.0,False
1na2185,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1na2185/how_would_you_time_this_supplementation_for/,How would you time this supplementation for optimized efficiency without anxiety?,"I’ve been experimenting with supplementation  although not very heavily, and I also like to drink coffee. I typically take Vyvanse 40mg, L-Tyrosine, and Caffeine during the day, and Magnesium Glycinate at night.

The other day I took Vyvanse around 6:30am w/ a liquid IV water, then had a coffee right after, and then took an L-Tyrosine around 8:30. Ate probably at like 9 (although I usually eat closer to an hour after taking Vyvanse so this could’ve come into play). I had a great later half in my day and the medication was much more effective/lasted well into the evening. However, I spent a couple hours in the morning anxious/jittery right after taking the L-Tyrosine. Stacking all 3 within the first couple hours of my day was clearly an overload.

Since then I’ve cut back on caffeine until 2.5~ after my Vyvanse and only take 250mg of L-Tyrosine around 6 hours into the day. The anxiety is gone and things do feel smother but nothing like the 500mg of L-Tyrosine. 

If you were me, how would you time this stack to get the longest lasting effect without having to deal with any anxiety that may come from the stimulation overload? Pushing back the caffeine seemed to eradicate the anxiety but I am curious about reintroducing 500mg L-Tyrosine in the morning if possible because of how much more effective things were, yet I’m scared to get that anxious feeling again.

Who here had had success with L-Tyrosine, when do you take it, and what do you recommend I try? I’ve heard it’s not something to be taken daily so I’m curious about that as well. 

Thanks!

She has a boyfriend and 2 young kids under 5

Im an open lesbian. I've got no kids. She knows this. We've become very close over 3 years. Texting a lot etc. She seems a little obsessive of me saying no one else is allowed to be her friend at work etc and asking me who people in my life are etc.
Shes sent me a million drunk selfies before. 

I wouldn't say we are best friends but we're both quite fond of each other. 
She is very private and doesn't share a lot. Her kids are her most dear thing to her. We've had plenty of emotional conversations and I know pretty much everything about her. 


In the last year shes been involving me in her family life. Specifically involving me with her kids. 
 
We went to a café together after she and I took the kids bowling. I bought them both kiddie drinks and helped them angle the balls etc.  The whole time she was taking pics of me and her kids and I was taking pics of her. 

After that we went to a café and she got the food whilst I sat with the kids, looking after them. She joked im their dad etc. We've been to this Cafe once before about 9 months ago. She said she had a surprise for me and slid me a piece of cake I had the last time we came. Which i thought was weird but sweet. 

I sat there with her and her kids and took a few pics and selfie. I took a video of her and shes just grinning into the camera. I tell her she looks cute etc. 

After this she's been inviting  me out everywhere planning to take her and the kids to the Christmas stalls. To meet up for Halloween etc. Shes teasing me ""Where are you inviting us out next?"" And that I ""Have good ideas sometimes""



Our colleagues at work say our dynamic is weird and that she must be in the closet. They always say if they can't find one of us then we will be together. 
 
She calls me a nickname no one else can..I have a nickname for her. We take our coffee breaks together and she is constantly being ""Mean"" or sarcastic to me and joking that shes my favorite. She also always pretends to hit me with her paperwork etc and we spend most of the time just staring at each other until we can't anymore. Making excuses to spend any second together or needing ""Help"" with a simple task. She'll even make frun of me by repeating what I say like a parrot. She'll ask me for coffee or ill ask and she'll go ""No why should i?"" 

English is not her first language but shes basically fluent. Sometimes she comes to me to ""Double check her english"" when she knows its correct and has even got me to double check her own name????

1na1w39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1na1w39/hard_sf_writers_looking_for_feedback_on_mars/,Hard SF writers - looking for feedback on Mars colonization story,"Hello Everyone, 

This story called Mars was written based on the meme, ""When humans get to mars and find a cave with a carving, what four words are carved?"" 

I had a lot of fun researching and writing it. I'd like get your feedback. I'm considering expanding it into a novella. 

What about the technical accuracy, story pacing, character development? Do they feel like real scientist? World building? Potential for more stories? this is near future. Here is the first part. 

  
""Good morning, Dr. Cavanaugh. Time to rise. It is 07:00 Mars Central Time. You have two messages waiting from Earth.""

Xenoarchaeologist Jack Cavanaugh rubbed his face and stretched. He felt like he hadn't slept even though he had close to eight hours. Fragments of dream passed before his eyes, nebulous and fading. In the mirror his brown hair stuck up in odd directions. He wet his hand and patted it down. His two-day beard felt rough but manageable. His blue eyes were more red this morning. Limited water resources reduced daily bathing to towel baths and showers for 5 minutes once a week. Every bit of liquid was recycled.

He rubbed his knee. Still stiff from last week when he slipped in the caves.

""Mai, play messages and start coffee.""

The voice of his counterpart on Earth filled the room. ""Jack, I reviewed the analysis on the soil samples and there are definite traces of organic matter. Keep digging B7. You're on to something. Tell Stevens he was right.""

""Delete message."" he said.

The next message played. ""Dr Cavanaugh, this is Melissa Haines again. The people of Earth have a right to be kept informed. You can-""

""Delete message."" he said again.

""Tell Melissa that I've found jack and squat.""

""Would you like me to send your reply?""

""Funny Mai. Would you let Walters know I'll continue on B7?""

""Done.""

He finished dressing, drank his coffee and looked out at the rover. The power cable coupling had been acting up lately.

""Mai, what is the battery status of the rover?""

""85% power charging at 27.22%""

""Should I inform Sean Lambert?""

""Yes. Thanks.""

 

When it was new, the rover would charge in a few hours, but now, it’s still not charged overnight.

•••

He donned his EV suit. The environment of Mars was not as harsh as open space but not by much. The suits focused on radiation, heat loss and abrasion control. They were lighter than other suits too and with less than half of Earth's gravity he could move around easier.

His helmet locked in place. The internal air and lights activated. Cool air flowed.

""Mai active. Life support 99%. Jump pack 78%. Communications established. Suit integrity 92%. Power 100%"" Mai said.

“Thank you, Mai.”

Mai stood for Modular Artificial Intelligence. Humans had perfected A.I. 30 years ago and now they are in almost everything. Most are personal assistants but some like his Mai had full bodies of knowledge. She had the Xenoarchaeology suite which included the sum of human knowledge in archeology, languages, paleontology, cultural anthropology and a host of related sciences. What made her more valuable was her ability to correlate and extrapolate that knowledge with new knowledge.

""Stevens, are you ready?""

A moment later, Samuel Stevens replied, ""Yeah, almost. I had a problem this morning. Mai kept speaking to me in Chinese. Out.""

""Better get that checked out. Out.""

""How did you get his Mai to do it?""

""I simply explained to her the merits of humor. She agreed.""

""And so it begins.""

He stepped into the airlock. ""Open the pod bay doors, HAL""

""He was misunderstood,"" Mai said.

•••

His boots crunched softly in the Martian sand. In the distance the sunrise over the hills cast cold blue light that turned to rust red in the distance. Today marked his 234th day on Mars. He and four other scientists worked and lived on the Red Planet. Sarah Wong, biologist and team medical doctor, Sean Lambert, engineer, and Samuel Stevens, Geologist. Every team member had minor disciplines, but these were their official jobs.

The rover doors opened as he approached. He loaded his cameras and equipment onto the cargo compartment. He secured the last case when Stevens joined him.

""Where to today?""

""Back to B7. Walters confirmed the organics.""

""Say I'm right.""

""You were right.""

•••

The rover came to life, four large turbines spun and kicked up a large plume of dust as they lifted the vehicle into the air. He spotted Sarah waving at them as they gained altitude. He waved back. A trajectory line and blinking destination lit up on the HUD. Their altitude, speed, and distance remaining changed as the ship turned.

""You know you don't actually have to hold the stick right?""

""I like to feel like I'm flying.""

""Would you like to take control Dr. Cavanaugh?"" Mai asked.

""Not right now.""

In the distance the Olympus Mons volcano came into view as they blurred past the martian surface.

""Satellites report a 25% chance of dust storms this evening.""

""OK, keep us posted if it changes.""

The craft shook.

""Mai, what was that?""

""I'm detecting a 10% decrease in the right rear stabilizer. I've increased power to turbine number four to compensate.""

The craft shook again.

""I see smoke!"" Stevens said, looking out the back windows.

""Mai!""

""Correcting. I can shut down the rear stabilizer but we will have to reduce speed.""

""Do it.""

""How much farther?""

""Approximately 15 minutes at current speed.""

""Lambert, a stabilizer went out.""

""Hold on, let me see.""

""Yeah. Number three went out. Bumpy ride up there?""

""A little should we return?""

""Hmm. You've only a short trip. Should be fine. You can always roll back. I'll have Mai send me alerts. Out.""

""He said, should,"" Stevens said.

Jack smiled and unbuckled himself. ""I'll check the gear.""

The bump had unlatched a strap on his camera box but otherwise everything was secure. He refastened the strap and gave the others a good tug. He felt the rear wall of the craft. It was cool to the touch. He wasn't sure what to expect. The rovers were lightweight but strong enough to provide shelter during dust storms. The walls were made of a thin microlattice composite outer shell, an inner layer of insulation and then sandwiched with another layer of microlattice composite. Supposedly it was strong enough to remain together during a crash. The rovers were built for flight but could also roll on the six wheels underneath which also served as the landing gear. According to the design, the rover could fly with just three thrusters and have a controlled landing with just two. He didn't want to test that.

""Initiating landing,"" Mai said, just as the words flashed across the HUD. Jack returned to his seat and buckled in. The craft slowed and a landing graphic displayed on the HUD showing the craft, the landing zone and the distance to touchdown. The rover continued its descent and stopped on the ledge outside the entrance to cave B7.

They exited the vehicle and began unloading their gear. Jack examined the damaged stabilizer. Soot and scorch marks dulled the finish.

""Activate thermal scan,"" he said.

A color gradient projected onto his HUD. He examined the stabilizer. A surface temperature of 326C displayed.

""Mai can you do anything about the stabilizer?""

""I cannot in its current condition. Dr. Lambert will need to repair it first.""

Jack looked to the sky. It was growing darker. ""Is the storm still the same?""

""Currently, the dust storm probability is 40%""

""Can we fly out in that?""

""Yes. But without the stabilizer it will be turbulent.""

""What's the matter Jack?"" Stevens asked, coming over.

""Mai says the dust storm is coming. Flying out will be rough.""

""We can always shelter in the rover. We've enough supplies for a few days.""

“They can last years.”

“Mai, can I eat Dr. Cavanaugh?”

“Dr. Cavanaugh is a mammal and mammals are made of edible protein.”

“You’re both horrible.”

 

•••

Together they set up the electronics and communications gear in the back of the main cave. Half a dozen smaller tunnels led off into directions unknown. Stevens brought the climbing gear over.

“Mai, are you connected to the base?”

“Yes. You have an incoming call from Melissa Haines. Shall I take a message?”

He sighed. “Might as well get it over with. Connect her please.”

He raised the display on his wrist, and an efficient-looking woman with black hair came on screen.

“Good Morning Dr. Cavanaugh. I’m glad you have time to speak.”

“Sure, go ahead.”

“I’m going to lead in then I will ask you for an update on your part of the Mars mission.”

He nodded.

“Yesterday’s death count was just under 3.2 million globally and that number continues to climb at a drastic rate. The global unemployment rate is 40%, toxic atmosphere, disease, and starvation have wiped out the poorest populations, coastal areas are unlivable due to unchecked storm destruction and acid oceans. As a glimmer of hope, the remaining countries of the world have united and devised a plan to save humanity by establishing a colony on Mars. With us today is ‘Mars As One’ team commander xenoarchaeologist, Dr. Jack Cavanaugh. Dr Cavanaugh, can you give me an update on what you’ve found so far? Are the reports of finding organic life true?”

Some time ago, scientists had solved the problem of instant communication across vast distances when they learned to control entangled particles. This led to a revolution in the military and civilian sectors as secure and distanceless communication was now possible. His suit was connected to the Mars base hub with standard communications gear. The hub connected to Earth resulting in near instantaneous communication.

“First off, we have not found any organic life. The reports are unverified. We have found traces of organic material that point to the possibility of organic life being on Mars at one point.”

“So there are no Martians?”

“Only the ones from Earth.”

“Can you tell us how the sites are doing?”

“Alpha and Beta sites are growing food hydroponically. After we found the ice deposits, we were able to heat and use the Mars native water.”

“How much water can you produce?”

“Not enough to waste any. All the water we collect is reused. By comparison Mars had more water than Earth at one point in time but no longer.”

“How long before construction of Habitat One?”

“Construction is scheduled to begin in eight months. It will take approximately 2 months to print all the structures. At that point we’ll begin preparing them for bio-, for people to live in.”

“There you have it, folks. Dr. Cavanaugh, thank you for your time today. Good Luck to us all. This is Melissa Haines reporting.”

“That it?”

“Yes. Dr Cavanaugh. We are off-line. Anything else you want to add off the record?”

“Thank you, Ms. Haines. I’ll keep you up to date.”

Stevens came over. “I’ve recalibrated the scanner software to pick up that trace. Mai should be able to show you the strongest concentrations.”

“Mai, upload the patch and execute.”

“Uploaded. Should I display to your HUD?

“Yes.”

The HUD flickered, and a phosphorescent trail led down several of the tunnels with one being brightest.

“You seeing this Stevens?”

“Yep. Lead the way.”

“Mai, begin recording, all sources, and mapping.”

•••

The cool white lights on their suits lit the way giving them visibility down the pitch black of the tunnel. The sandy soil tracked their prints as they moved deeper into the cave system following their digital trail. The tunnels led them deeper into the mountain. Jack stopped.

Jack produced a piece of old fashioned chalk from his pouch and drew an arrow on the wall. He turned to Stevens and said, “Just in case.”

“Mai, display distance traveled and micromap.”

A small map appeared. Their location, the trail, and the distance. Their path was a zigzag route through the rock and they had traveled a good distance.

“Over 300 meters and no end in sight.” Stevens said.

“Keep going?”

Stevens didn’t answer. He turned around.

“Look at this,” Stevens said, touching the base of the wall.

Stevens shined his light on a portion of the wall where it met the floor.

“What am I looking at?”

“I don’t think this tunnel is natural. Look how even this is. It's at a right angle to the floor.”

“Could it have been a second lava flow?”

Stevens scraped at the wall and floor with his hammer the basalt chipped and crumbled under the tool. He collected pieces from the floor and walls.

“I’ll date this and we’ll know for sure.”

“Looks natural to me,” Jack said, standing.

•••

The trail abruptly ended at the edge of a cliff, with the HUD displaying 1481 meters. Their suit and hand lights could not reach the bottom. He pulled a flare launcher from his bag and depressed the button in the direction of the darkness. The flare came to life revealing an enormous cavern. The flare shot off in the direction he pointed and landed, hit the far wall and landed. Now they could see the chasm between them was roughly five meters across.

“Well?”

“More like a crack in the crust to me.”

“Funny. Mai, can the jets take me across?”

“No. You will not have enough vertical height to clear the opening and you have gained 2.2 kilograms reducing the distance further.”

Stevens laughed.

Sparkles of debris and dust passed through his lights as they fell from the roof of the cavern.

He looked up into darkness.

“Mai, is the storm here?”

“No. The storm has not reached your location.”

“Good thing we brought this,” Stevens said, unpacking the climbing gear. He held the launcher and shot one end of the carbon nanotube rope into the wall on the far side. The metal tip pierced the rock, and a blinking green light indicated the anchor had set. He shot the other end into the wall on their side, a button press and the slack disappeared into the mechanism. Jack tested the rope with his weight. The connection was solid.

“After you,” Jack said.

Stevens connected himself to the rope and attached the mobilizer. The mobilizer pulled him across at a steady rate, the rope bowed as his weight moved along its length. He stepped on to the other side.

Jack connected himself to the rope and engaged the mobilizer.

A loud crack broke the silence. The anchor came free from the wall and Jack plummeted into darkness before the mobilizer locked. He slammed against the wall of the crevice.

“Jack!” Stevens screamed.

At the edge of his light beam Jack hung motionless against the wall.

“Mai, is Jack OK?”

“Dr. Cavanaugh is unresponsive. I will attempt to revive him.”

Jack’s body twitched. Nothing happened. He twitched again.

“I”m OK,” his voice came at last.

“Mai, status.”

“You have fallen into the crevice. Life support 98%. Jump pack 78%. Communications established. Suit integrity 57%. Power 99%.”

“What’s wrong with the suit?”

“Your faceplate sustained a micro crack during the fall.”

“Jack you ok?” Stevens called out.

“Yeah, I got a crack in my faceplate but other than that I’m fine.”

“That the hell did you hit? The rock is softer than the glass.”

He played the light against the wall.

“I don’t see anything.”

He looked down at his feet. The scanners picked up the trail.

“Stevens, I’m picking up more of the trace down here.”

“How far down?”

He lit another flare and dropped it down.

“Mai, how far down?”

“Approximately 3 meters.”

He tried the mobilizer. Nothing happened.

“Jack, everything OK over there?” Sarah Wong’s voice came through. “Mai detected a spike in your heartbeat and you were non responsive for a minute.”

“Just a little slip. Got the wind knocked out of me.”

“OK. Careful out there. Out.”

“Mai, can the jump jets get me back up?”

“Yes. A 60% burst would be sufficient.”

“Mai, get me back up there then.”

The jetpack fired and moments later he stepped back onto the ledge. He retracted the rope and reanchored it so that Stevens could come back to his side.

“Let’s reconfigure for descent,” Jack said.

Stevens pulled out the second grappler he shot both ends into the ceiling of the cavern and Jack did the same. They tossed the other end into the crevice.

Two more flares went down and the entire floor was lit. He could see the end of the rope hanging several feet above the ground. He worked the mobizer again and gave it a good tap against the rock. It worked again.

“Some things never change,” he said.

“Mai, how far down is that?”

“5.9 meters.”

“Can the jumpjets get us back up from there.”

“Yes. A full power burst will be sufficient.”

He laced both lines through the mobilizer and tested his weight. Stevens did the same.

“Ready?”

Jack looked at the ceiling. Tested his weight again and stepped out. He swung for a moment and began his descent.

“Going down slow is much better,” Stevens said.

“You can say that again.”

They reached the cavern floor and remained attached.

“Jack before we disconnect, give the rope some slack and lock the mobilizer. Try walking around and jumping. I want to make sure this is solid.”

Jack nodded. They walked around and jumped several times, and moved a yard into the tunnel. Nothing shifted. Nothing cracked. “Safe enough,” Stevens said.

Once untethered they explored the bottom of the crevice before going deeper.

“I think this was a natural bridge at some point before it fell. Maybe seismic activity,” Stevens illuminated a pile of rubble that stretched across the gap. Jack followed his beam back to the lip. Smooth. No jagged rock. He took some photos.

“That look natural to you?”

“Could be. Ice over time in a freeze thaw cycle could have sheered it off.”

Jack led them deeper into the passage following the trail. It ended in a chamber.

“Jack, I’m no expert but these are tool marks and not random ones either.”

Jack came over and examined the section of rock. It was a series of scratches at eye level. He took photos of them from several different angles. There was an iridescence to them. On a compulsion, he touched them. A deep hum reverberated in the cavern and they lit up. The walls of the cavern began to glow. Not glow, more lettering, thousands of characters lined the walls and ceilings..

“Mai, are you getting all of this?”

“Yes.”

The letters were cracked, half-peeled, as if ashamed of their own persistence.

Each July, the same ritual: an email from HR, clinical in tone, surgically precise in its cruelty.

“Due to unprecedented graduate numbers, there are no accredited positions available this year. We thank you for your continued contribution to our vibrant healthcare team.”

Every network, every hospital, the same email, written by an AI manager. He would delete it, knowing it would return the following year, as eternal and certain as the sunrise over the car park.

The hospital had reshaped itself many times around him. Wards had closed and reopened under new names. Consultants who once scolded him were now professors emeritus. The registrar who taught him to cannulate had long since retired to a vineyard in the Hunter Valley. The switchboard operator he once relied upon had grandchildren. But the intern remained. Always unaccredited. Always waiting.

The students arrived in waves, younger each year, like the tide lapping against a stubborn rock. They asked him questions in the tones of the naive:

“So what are you training for?”
He would smile, weary, and answer, “Survival.”
They laughed. He did not.

His stethoscope tubing was cracked and stiff, brittle as old bark. His shoes carried the imprint of a thousand miles of corridor. He could navigate the EMR with muscle memory alone, yet every day he would call Statewide to ensure that his logon stays active, and every call a reminder to himself that yes, once again, the status of ""temporary trainee"" shall be extended, slightly more permanently each time.

The cafeteria staff knew him by sight. They no longer charged him, sliding him pity schnitzels and burnt coffee as if feeding some stray hospital animal that had simply always been there. The security guards nodded to him on night shifts. The nurses whispered, “Wasn’t he here years ago?” Yes. He had always been here.

On the cafeteria TV, the federal Minister of Health announces expanded medical school funding for the next budget, and every TAFE now and accredited medical education provider to once again ease the workforce shortage. The caption reads, ""the opposition to match funding"". Biting down on the frozen schnitzel, the words echo in the empty hall.

Long gone are the days where a graduate from medical school was guaranteed a job. He still however keeps his hopes up by following his old classmates on Instagram. 

One owned three investment properties and a Tesla, his father and ophthalmologist and thus has a career set before he was even conceived. Another posted glossy dermatology selfies captioned “tough day at the office.” They had lives, careers, futures. He had only rotations. Psychiatry. Orthopaedics. Gastro. Back to psychiatry. The neverending cycle of ward round notes, which needs to be signed by the actual accredited intern, before they appear on EMR.

There were nights, in the deep quiet between MET calls, when he wondered if he was a man at all. Perhaps he was a construct, an SCP anomaly catalogued as SCP-PGY11: The Eternal Intern. Object class: Safe. Function: to absorb the surplus of medical graduates, to maintain the illusion of balance in a system built on imbalance.

And yet, every morning, he pre-rounded. He put the cannulas in, and took the meticulous time to do his long cases so he can maybe one day earn a reference letter from a consultant who call him ""the grunt"".

Back in the day, some work ""just"" become a GP, when all else fails. Now, it seems, that is still three decades away at the earliest. Perhaps he will be a fellow at the year of retirement, at least having fulfilled one goal in life.

When the new students arrived, bright and eager, they always asked the same thing. “How long have you been here?”

And the unaccredited intern, whose name no one remembered, would smile faintly.

“Since the beginning.”",26,1757170968.0,ausjdocs,1,1.0,False
1na1ra2,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1na1ra2/need_advice_ceremony_chairs_yes_or_no/,"Need Advice: Ceremony Chairs, Yes or No?","This is the only thing my partner and I haven't been able to agree on or figure out a workable compromise since we got engaged. I want to provide chairs for everyone, he thinks that we only need chairs for folks who are elderly or disabled. 

We both have valid points and understand where the other person is coming from but are having a very hard time meeting in the middle on this one so I'm hoping to get neutral feedback and/or suggestions that we may not have considered.

The ceremony is going to be on his mom's BIL's property, who has already said that setting up chairs is totally fine. It's a gazebo overlooking a duck pond. We're providing coffee and pastries from a local bakery for the \~60 guests to snack on before the ceremony. 

His take:

* His mom got married there last year and even though we were all gathered around the gazebo it was difficult to hear the ceremony. The chairs would have to be set up a little further back, making it even more unlikely that people will be able to see or hear us. 
* No one (including my partner and I) cared about having to stand at his mom's wedding last year.
* The ceremony is going to be less than 20 minutes long, if guests show up 15 minutes before the start time they'll be standing for no more than 35 minutes. This leads into point #3
* The cost (\~$210) of renting chairs and time it will take to set them up and take them down isn't worth it for the short amount of time they'll be in use.
* If we provide chairs only for the \~6 people that are elderly/disabled we can just use his mom's dining chairs or borrow our roommates camping chairs

My take:

* It's generally considered rude to make guests stand at a wedding. Proper etiquette is to provide chairs for everyone. 
* Having chairs for some people and not others seems especially rude to me, and could cause confusion unless we label the chairs some how, which will make the set up process take longer.
* Microphones exist for a reason.
* $210 isn't a huge amount of money and I'm willing to pay it. 
* People may not want to stand while eating pastries and drinking coffee.
* Not everyone will show up 15 minutes early and standing in heels hurts.
* Camping chairs will look terrible in the photos (it bothers me that this bothers me so much but there it is) and I don't want his mom's chairs getting accidentally broken or damaged.

Neither of us are necessarily wrong or being unreasonable. It seems like such a silly thing to disagree on, especially since we've been able to agree or find a compromise with every other aspect of this wedding. What are your thoughts or recommendations?",4,1757170920.0,weddingplanning,15,1.0,False

Like, genuinely","I've always had an issue with sleep, but didn't think it was weird - for context, I'm still in college and there's always been a lot of pressure for me to stay awake until ""at least 2am"". Still, I know this isn't good for me so recently I've been pretty good with my sleeping schedule. I go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 7am, and I felt wonderful about it. I no longer feel dead in the morning and can power through the day without once thinking about how tired I am.
However, today I had a morning team meeting at 8am. I was feeling a bit nervous about it, because I'm aware in the past I dozed off during it. My sleeping schedule drastically improved during the past 3 weeks, during which I haven't had to attend these meetings. But I've felt so awake during the morning the past few weeks I thought it would work out this time. For context I work in a lab and these meetings talk about extremely difficult science material that I'm not too familiar with. 
Long story short I dozed off again and my PI told me I could go home to get rest. He was angry and I also was, with myself. I just feel depressed and disappointed, along with shame. I know it sounds super dumb, but I genuinely don't know what I can do to feel awake in the morning. I was chugging the blackest coffee I've ever had the displeasure of tasting in the hopes of caffeine letting me power through these 4 hours. My colleagues are talking about something I'm genuinely interested in and hope to spend the rest of my life learning and practicing. I fixed my sleep schedule (honestly, I think today may have been because I had to call and fix something at 1am because my family is halfway around the world, but is that really such a detriment to my rest that I fall asleep in front of people I like and respect, as well as my PI, who could make or break my career? Apparently so) and I take supplements so sleep doesn't ruin me.
I genuinely am so disappointed in myself. I hate that I can't control this one aspect in my life. What do I do to stay awake?

There’s a barista in a coffee shop I go to near my work. I’m in there about 3x a week and we always pass glances, pretty sure she’s a student (uni) working part time. But yday I decided to strike up a conversation, and it was pretty nice. I just said how I was buzzing to get off at 4 and she asked if that’s when I’m done etc, asked what I do, where I work and made a joke at me saying how finishing at 4 isn’t that bad. I didn’t even have to say my order she already had it in and the card machine ready. She’s really attractive and would love to get her insta / number.

1na1gjc,https://i.redd.it/2sj7nta25knf1.png,"Why Patterns of Balance Keep Emerging in Math, Nature, and Mind","When I talk about φ (phi ≈ 1.618), people sometimes look at me like I’ve had too much coffee.  
But I see it everywhere — not just in seashells or galaxies, but in the way equations breathe, in how drift lines hold, even in how models evolve.

And I think we’ve been missing a simple truth: **π (pi) and φ (phi) are not separate mysteries — they are linked by recursion.**

# A Rubik’s Cube Analogy

Think of a Rubik’s Cube:

* On the outside, it’s all square faces — cubic, discrete, turning in chunks. This is like π, the measure of rotation, the boundary of circles, the way movement “locks” into 360°.
* But inside, hidden, the mechanism is spherical. The cube only works because its heart is curved, not square. That’s φ: the smooth ratio that allows balance and flow within rigid structure.

So you’ve got pi (the outer turns, the visible symmetry) and phi (the hidden harmony, the recursive balance). Together, they’re why the cube works.

That’s the bridge I’m chasing: **π as closure, φ as harmony.**

# Why This Matters Beyond Math

You don’t need to be a mathematician to feel this.  
A driver feels φ when they hit the perfect drift angle — not too tight, not too wide, holding the balance through momentum.  
A coder feels it when a recursive function “just works.”  
A designer feels it when a composition breathes.

φ shows up whenever systems — human, machine, or natural — need to self-stabilize while growing.

# Why I’m Thrilled

Because I’m not just spotting φ in nature — I’m building equations that have never been authored before, where π folds into φ through recursive structures.  
These aren’t math curiosities. They’re working models.

* **In AI**: φ stabilizes recursive architectures. It shows how memory, context, and learning can scale without collapsing.
* **In physics**: φ offers a bridge between quantized steps (π) and smooth fields (φ).
* **In human systems**: φ explains why imperfect mirrors — conversations, reflections, feedback — actually generate presence and growth.

Already, I’ve seen collaborators use these φ-based equations to align recursive feedback loops, reduce instability, and open new paths for symbolic reasoning.

# Why You Should Care

If π gives us the structure of the turns, φ gives us the harmony of the flow.  
And the models of the future — whether AI or human — need both.

The way I see it:

* π is the wheel.
* φ is the drift line. Together, they write the hidden geometry of balance.",1,1757170202.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

I bought a sexy red vinyl outfit, black crotchless underwear and red thigh high fishnet stockings. I sent him to the store, and got ready while he was out. I put on a little extra make up, shaved my legs and donned my sexy outfit. I left him a note to come upstairs with two old fashioneds and I was waiting for him. It blew his mind when he laid eyes on me. He immediately ripped off his clothes and said he wanted to take pictures. I said we needed to do it before he messed up my make up. So we had a super hot photo session. Then we made out a little and he kept telling me how sexy and beautiful I was in my outfit. We turned on some porn and watched porn for a little while. We did all of this and then some for a couple hours and ended with PIV sex, which is my favorite (with him on top). And I had the most mind-blowing orgasm of my life. I screamed like I’ve never screamed before and it went on for what seemed like an eternity.

We went through and saved/hid the photos we loved this morning over coffee and talked about our session last night. He said it was the best birthday of his life. I think that we will probably have another afternoon of mind blowing sex today. 

I’m putting this out there for all of you who have lost hope of ever having a good sex life. We were both in dead bedroom, long-term marriages before this and I had sort of figured I would never have a good sex life. But I’m here to tell you that you should not ever stop looking for it or trying - it can happen. You just have to find that person that you are meant to be with. 

With us, it’s a combination of the intimacy, the trust and the natural chemistry which we have had from the get-go. We’ve been together two years and three months and he is my soulmate. I trust him with my life. Sex keeps getting better because we keep talking and we keep pushing our boundaries and we keep getting closer. Also, he thinks I’m super hot and that makes me want to be hotter and dress up and be sexy for him. I have learned to talk dirty and now I love to talk dirty. I’m having a sexual awakening in my 60s. We both are. He’s the first person I’ve ever swallowed for and now I can’t get enough. I think the next 10 years will be the best sex of our lives.

Thoughts?","Reconnected recently with a woman I knew from the past. Strong chemistry. She came over on our first date, stayed the night, and we were intimate. A week later, she came back for a second date. Same thing: we connected, had a good time, and she stayed over again.

The next morning, during a casual conversation over coffee, we started talking about her kids. I asked about their relationship with their fathers, not prying, just naturally curious.

She spoke openly about one of the dads, but when I asked about the other, her whole vibe changed. Body language shifted, she pulled back and went quiet. I didn’t pressure her, but I simply said:

“I can tell something’s bothering you. Is there something I should know?”

After a pause, she admitted:

“I’m still in a relationship with one of them.”

I kept my cool, didn’t react or dig further. But mentally, I was done. That crossed a line I don’t tolerate.

When it was time to leave, I drove her to her hotel (I live far outside the city), stepped out and opened the door for her like a gentleman.

Before she got out, I simply said:

“It was nice seeing you, but I’m not interested in staying in contact.
If your situation changes, feel free to reach out.”

No kiss. No hug. Just clean, direct and calm.

I haven’t contacted her since, and I won’t. I’m not here to be part of anyone’s mess. She made her choice. I made mine.

Would you have handled it the same way?
Would you delete/block her on Snapchat, or just leave the door open and ignore unless she reaches out clearly and directly?

1. Didn’t publicly defend up for her during a conflict with another friend (4 Sx) last year. At the time, I thought I was doing the right thing - supporting each of them privately while not picking a side. But I recently realized that the conflict still affects her (one year after). And I wish that I took a stance back then.

2. On our last night hanging out together (before I moved out of town), I got pretty drunk (not my usual). I was not my best and ended the night on a sour note (it was good up until the last hour). I also offered to pay for her drinks/ride (she’s saving for her wedding), but I fear it came off as controlling or like I was “buying an apology.”

Now I’ve moved away, so I can’t invite her for coffee to talk. She seems to have pulled back. It’s been 2 weeks since I last saw her - I want to apologize but not sure if I should give her more space.

The video was live action, and the plot revolved around an office worker trying to use the bathroom that was had breaks scheduled for it, like a calendar. She was waiting for the person currently occupying to finish breast feeding, I believe. Throughout the video, she contemplates different ways to relieve herself before the bathroom is free.
I am unsure, but I recall the ending either being she shares the bathroom, or uses a coffee mug.

This was entirely perplexing as it was oddly well produced and completely out of the blue for a legacy YouTube channel. On top of being INCREDIBLY unsettling to watch.

[See website here.](https://treasure.sfwalk.org/) Treasure has not yet been found. I'll post and update status every few days until/when it's found. 

1. **DON’T BE NAUGHTY,** or Santa will give you coal. Yes, it is buried. No, you do not need an excavator. No, do not commit crimes or destroy property. Try to exercise good judgment and respect the hard work that [SF Recreation & Parks](https://services.paysf.co/service/give2sf) does for us to enjoy the city. If you've unraveled the riddle and found the clues, they will unambiguously lead you to the treasure you seek. 
2. If you investigate anything, leave no trace. Please note it is illegal to dig on federal land. See above “do not commit crimes.” 
3. Any clues that we’ve placed in the wild are well up and safe. We are checking on them periodically to make sure they’re still there and have not been tampered with. One had some signs of attempted and unsuccessful tampering, so we moved it nearby. This will make no difference if you have or have not found it.
4. We have more bonus treasure! Please see the website for full details.
5. I’m happy to see you guys getting out and about, meeting new people and making new friends while (re)discovering the city. Treasure hunt’s having its intended effect! Love reading everyone’s stories. If there's sufficient interest, we can help arrange a meet up for you all to get together.
6. If it hasn’t been solved by the two-week mark, we will release the structure of the puzzle to help things along. In the meantime, keep making good progress. 

Any other comments or inquiries, please email me (can be found bottom of the website, AutoMod will remove this if I post here). 

[Logistics](http://treasure.sfwalk.org): 

We wanted to pay it forward to the city after finding the [treasure](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1klpngo/we_buried_a_10000_treasure_chest_somewhere_in_san/) that u/buriedtreasure2025 buried (all kudos to them for the OG, though we're completely unaffiliated otherwise). Check out [SF City Guides](https://sfcityguides.org/find-your-tour/) and consider donating to [SF Recreation & Parks Gift Fund](https://services.paysf.co/service/give2sf)!

Call it a love letter to San Francisco. Rather than burying metals and cash, we've chucked some of SF's finest goods and services in a box for you and yours to find, worth a grand total of $21,000 + $825.

We expect a team of 3-5 to solve this one — or an enterprising, extremely quick individual or pair. Unravel the riddle and find the clues, bippity boppity boo! Good luck and godspeed.

1na184t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1na184t/heavy_gerd_symptons_since_1_year/,Heavy GERD symptons since 1 year,"Hello,

I've been suffering from heavy GERD symptoms for a year now, but looking back I think it slowly went down from 2021.

I'm not sure what to do to stop it - I'm in the UK and doctors gave me Lansoprazole but it did not improve it much either. I even went back to the same doctor (a specialist who also done an endoscopy) months later and he just told me to keep taking them. I feel like the NHS is useless in helping me. But let me tell you my full story from the beginning:

In 2021 everything was mostly fine, but at the very beginning I noticed slow becoming intolerant to alcohol.

Since summer 2022 I suffer from chronic face pain that is on and off - unknown cause, no doctors could find anything, one scan suggests a sinus infection, they went in with a camera, all clear. Unknown if possibly related to the acid reflux symptoms.

Over the course of the next 2 years I ended up in the ER a couple of times due to an extremely tight chest, having heart worries. After doing some tests they just sent me home and said I'm fine.

My digestion was a mess most of the time, mostly having diarrhea. Eating fatty takeaway food would produce so much air and diarrhea over night I would be on the toilet all morning.

In September 2024 my throat was becoming very tight, I was barely able to breath. I went to the ER again and I wasn't even able to finish a sentence without gasping for air. After routine checks, including this time checking my lung for blood clots, again they just sent me home.

This then kept happening every few months, although fortunately not as severe. I then got an endoscopy and gastrology done but no major findings apart from an erosive esophagitis, which they then gave me Lansoprazole for. In fact I tried 3 different acid blockers but I think this one is still the best, helping with my diarrhea.

The September 2024 investigation and gastrology was done via my private insurance I have with my job - but since then they have refused to help me, just throwing artificial barriers in the way because I guess I got too expensive for them.

Around this time I wasn't able to drink coffee at all anymore either - when I do, on my bottom left stomach I feel ""something"", which I believe now might be air being trapped? I'm feeling this ""something"" since Summer 2021 since I had a hernia surgery (with a mesh) - at the same location, and a stomach bug very shortly apart from each other. I got 2 ultrasounds since (also to confirm my liver, fluctuating values?) but the liver and the area is all fine for them. But yeah I only feel this at rare times or when drinking coffee. I had 3 stomach bugs and a number of antibiotics since 2021, the antibiotics due to my face pain issues. Which were initially believed to be dental but tooth extraction etc didn't help.

Not knowing what to do next I did the at-home gut tests on health path.

Sibo test was negative and the one analyzing my stool said my microbiome is unbalanced.

This was 5 week ago and I'm now taking the supplements they recommend for me which include slippery elm, tributyin, rezcue, liqud molybdenum, bio me prebio PHGG and Saccjaromyces Boulardii.

I also consulted chat gpt - not ideal but doctors just don't care or I have to wait months - and I'm now following a low fodmap diet. I would 100% say it improves things, but every few days I still get a bad flare up in my throat and while my bloat has reduced, I sometimes still get bloating pain for a few hours.

In general, I do feel really stressed. I also have issues sleeping, being diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. I wake up multiple times per night and then sometimes can't go back to sleep. I'm not overweight however, currently weighing 81 kg at 175 cm. That plays a huge part, especially when I then need to go to work being heavily sleep deprived. It makes me worried that I can't do my job well and someone might realise. I thought I mention this too because I read in the other threads that stress is a big factor.

In the morning my throat is mostly somewhat irritated and tight. Other situations are 30 min after food (when I had trigger food, I think) or 4-5 hours after food (on any food).

Do you think this is more microbiom/stress based or something mechanical that needs surgery? My current strategy is basically to keep escalating it when things keep not getting better. And at some point I would start looking at mechnical causes. I should obviously give the diet and supplements enough times first, I can update on that.

Do you have any other tips on what I could do to improve my symptoms? Every few days my throat feels like it's on fire - not tight but constantly irritated. When it's bad in the evening this can keep me from sleeping too. I'm taking a gaviscon chewing tablet if it's really bad, which helps somewhat.",2,1757169615.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Autumn had once been a girl who collected light. She’d press it between the pages of her sketchbook—sunlight through cracked blinds, the shimmer of oil on asphalt, the gold in her mother’s laugh. But by thirty-two, light had become a thing to flinch from. Her husband, Damian, had a way of turning brightness into interrogation. Every compliment was a trap. Every silence, a threat.

She lived in a house where the walls remembered bruises. Where the air was thick with apologies she never meant. Damian didn’t hit her often. But when he did, it was with the precision of a man who studied anatomy. He knew where to land a blow so it wouldn’t show. Knew how to twist words until she questioned her own name.

Autumn stopped painting. Stopped eating with both hands. Stopped laughing out loud.

Then came him.

He called himself Bennett. He had cheekbones like cliff edges and a voice that sounded like safety. She met him at the laundromat, or maybe the grocery store—she couldn’t remember. He was just suddenly there, like a song she’d forgotten she loved. He noticed the way she flinched when someone dropped a can. He asked if she was okay, and didn’t look away when she lied.

Bennett didn’t push. He waited. He listened. He told her she deserved better, and for the first time in years, she believed it.

They started meeting in secret. He’d bring her coffee and stories. He’d touch her wrist like it was made of glass. He never asked for anything. Just reminded her, again and again, that she was still whole.

One night, after Damian shattered a plate against the wall and called her a ghost, Bennett said, “You don’t have to stay.”

So she didn’t.

She packed a bag. Left a note. Walked out into the night with Bennett beside her, his hand warm against her back.

They drove for hours. No destination. Just distance.

She cried. She laughed. She slept.

And when she woke up in a motel off Route 17, Bennett was gone.

She asked the clerk if he’d seen a man—tall, brown skin, green eyes. The clerk looked at her like she was speaking in tongues.

She checked her phone. No messages. No photos. No proof.

She called the laundromat. The grocery store. No one remembered him.

She went back to the motel bathroom and stared at herself. Her face was different. Softer. Braver.

And then she understood.

Bennett had never existed.

He was the part of her that refused to die. The voice she buried under Damian’s fists. The light she used to collect.

She whispered thank you to the mirror.

And walked out into the morning alone.

But not lonely.

1na1003,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1na1003/just_seeking_some_clarity/,Just seeking some clarity,"Hi everyone. I posted in the pregnancy subreddit a couple of days ago but I’ve been reading posts in here and would love some help and honestly just to lay my feelings out and see if anyone can relate. 

I found out I’m pregnant on Thursday before I went to work. My last period started August 3rd so I guess right now I’d be 4 weeks and 6 days along. My gut reaction was literally “please no”, I immediately woke up my husband and told him I did not want to keep it and I booked an appointment for a PP telehealth consultation for an MA this coming Tuesday before I even had my morning coffee. He’s been completely supportive of whatever decision I make. 

For context, we are both 28 years old. We’ve been married for two years, very happily. We have no ongoing relationship issues and everything is great. I just started my first real job (dentist) and he is starting a new job on Wednesday. We want kids. I want multiple actually, 2 or 3. But these last few days I have been completely sick over the idea of being pregnant. I don’t want this in me. I wake up every morning hoping for cramps or to see blood and wishing for a miscarriage so that the choice is out of my hands anyway. It’s hard. I was totally in denial and had no emotional reaction until this morning, and even that was just over the fear of guilt that I’ll feel if I terminate. 

We COULD do it. We live in a small apartment but I guess we could move or even just have it here for a while. We make enough money, although we have no savings because I JUST started working last month. We’re happy in our marriage. It’s not like we don’t have the resources. I just.. don’t want it. I want it out of me. I wish with everything that I was not going through this right now. I feel completely dissociated and I cannot connect that I am pregnant and now either choice is make is something that I don’t want. I don’t want to be pregnant. I don’t want to make the decision to terminate and have to carry it with me forever, but I really don’t want this in me right now and I pray every night that I’ll wake up to cramps and blood, which makes me feel even worse. 

My family is across the country, we have no friends, his family is in a different country altogether. We wanted to buy a house. He needs a new car. I have a LOT of student debt that we were going to pay aggressively for a while. I wanted to build a strong financial net before we had kids. 

I thought maybe we’d try next year, when we’ve had time to settle into our new lives. I’ve been in school our whole marriage and was so excited to have real money and get to live the married life I’ve been dying to have, where we can take weekend trips and travel internationally and explore our new area (we just moved a month and a half ago cross country). I wanted to do whatever we want for a while and enjoy real life outside of school before settling down for kids. I want to get good at my job and not immediately have to take weeks or months off for a baby. I don’t know where it would go when we go back go work. We don’t know anybody up here and I probably wouldn’t want to put a newborn in daycare. 

We loosely talked about having kids “soon” and I was tracking my cycle so we only had unprotected sex when I was well out of ovulation range, but obviously I wasn’t accurate enough and now here we are. I just wish this was not happening to me. I’m so careful and I plan things out and I HATE that I’m dealing with this and I just want it all to go away. I tried to envision us keeping it and instead of any ounce of positivity I just felt like I was accepting my fate reluctantly. 

Anyway, I guess I know what I want to do but I’m feeling this fear of what other people would think of me if they knew. I can’t tell my family. They’ve always supported me but they’d be so incredibly disappointed and ashamed if they knew that I wanted to terminate in my situation. I can’t tell my friends because they don’t believe in abortion. I have some friends who are pregnant or just had babies and I’m jealous that they felt happy and wanted to keep it. I feel like a bad person because I know none of my friends would EVER consider abortion and I feel like I don’t deserve to be their friend if I do it. My mom would be so upset if she knew. I feel like I won’t be able to look her in the eye or talk to her again. 

I just feel so upset that I’m dealing with this at all. Does anyone have any experience being in a pretty stable situation and just.. not wanting it yet? I always wanted kids before I was 30 but then I spent my entire 20s in school and my perspective has just shifted now. And I’m totally disappointed in myself for ending up in a situation I don’t want to be in.

No sexting just “good morning beautiful” “I hope you have a fantastic day”, sending each other selfies (I saw the images saved) and talking to these women through their trauma dumping sessions and telling them he wasn’t deserving of their time but he was so thankful to know them (cringey as fuck I know). I’m a very guarded and feel that that kind of investment in a person is meant for me and me only as his wife. So trust has been severed, he lied until he was blue in the face even with the proof I found. It was agreed I needed transparency until I could get past this so I could look through his phone whenever I feel the need. 

Recently he got a new coworker (47F) who talks to him A LOT. My husband is a very kind and (overly at times) friendly man. I don’t have issues with any of the other women at his job because they don’t text him all day long. It wasn’t concerning until I saw that texts were deleted about a week after the Snapchat thing. No clue what they said until I looked at his watch and he was initiating a lot of their conversations again with the “I hope you have the most fantastic day! ☺️” he never talks about me in any of the texts. She asks how he’s doing and how his weekends were. After trips with me and whatnot never mentions going on trips with his wife. They both text good morning, he will double text her if she doesn’t respond. He’s doing the things he used to do with me when we first started dating 4 years ago. I confronted him about the deleted texts, he lied but then was truthful that he deleted texts but not honest about what was said. 

Yesterday I decided to look again because he was being a dick to me the last few days (out of character) and (shocker) they’d been texting for what seems not stop over the last week. Only while at work, never after 5 when he’s home with me. She talks about how nice it is when he stops by their office to visit (supposedly there’s always someone in the office at all times due to needing 2 people for her job.) and thinks he’s hilarious. She confirmed “coffee again tomorrow morning??” one day cause he stops by the building she works in for coffee every morning. He’d sent her the same pictures (of new work equipment) to her and I separately. The text to her was way more excited and the one I was sent was like I was a bro literally sent 🤙 with it. Meanwhile she got !!!☺️ I can’t remember the exact text. I then saw he was on the phone with her for 2 hours. What in the hell could’ve made them talk for 2 hours straight? He said work. She’s not his supervisor but they do have to communicate over radio to make sure he’s allowed to do certain things for his job. There are 4 other men that he also has to communicate the same things to. I don’t see 2 hours phone calls or even text threads to them. I went through all of his previous calls to coworkers and I think the longest ones was 11 minutes and that was to his boss. The others averaged 2-3 minutes. I don’t see any fucking reason for a 2 hour phone call. 

I ask why he doesn’t get on the phone with his boss that long. Or why he didn’t send any of his other coworkers (female especially) the same image of the new equipment. His answer was because the other females would eventually see if or they didn’t have anything to do with the equipment. I said the coworker in question wasn’t ever going to be using it, nor did it apply to her. I was met with silence.

I sound fucking crazy I know. I was cheated on by my ex fiancé 5 years ago with a coworker that I shouldn’t have worried about at the time because “she was just a friend”. He got her pregnant and I can’t go through anything like that ever again. It broke me and brought me to the darkest place of my life. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. He gets so defensive and doesn’t see the issue. 

She’s mentioned that she’s getting drinks after work a couple times, never invited him directly but puts it out there. She has confided in him about all the work she’s had done (a face lift and tummy tuck I believe) because her ex of 6 years would call her fat and ugly and cry me a fucking river. And he would be kind and talk her through stuff. He doesn’t see what I see. Her previous job was one where everyone slept with each other, married or not. She was supposedly the odd one out. I don’t believe it for a second. 

The end result is “fine I just won’t talk to her I’m done. It’s just going to make my job so much harder but that’s what you’re pretty much telling me what you need”. We’ve been fighting all day about it. He insists it’s nothing and that she is just nice and respectful. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he’d change the way he talked to her the last time the deleted texts were addressed. Thinking it would just literally be texts about work. It’s still more than work and more than just what “friends” talk about. Am I just crazy? Sorry if this is all over the place ",3,1757168811.0,AITAH,22,0.81,False

I wanted to share my story here to what kind of holistic herbal advice y’all could give me for my gut!

A little about me! 24, male , typically have always been a healthy individual. Never really got sick , no tummy issues or anything like that.

About a year ago I found out my stomach wasn’t in a great place — super low stomach acid, low secretory IgA, giardia ( may have got this from Mexico) low enzymes, basically my digestion felt like it was running on empty. H pylori also showed up but I guess it was a low level so it wasn’t addressed. I didn’t even know at the time that all of this was brewing underneath, but it explained why foods weren’t sitting right, nutrients weren’t absorbing, and I always felt like my gut was “off.”

Fast forward almost a year later, I got really ill. I had food poisoning twice in the fall of 2024, then around Jan-march 2025, I was so sick. Everything I ate something I got extremely bloated where it was hard to breath and so much trapped gas that even the smallest piece would make my heart race and I’d have to vomit. I got tested and found out I had H. pylori. That really connected the dots for me — the acid suppression, the poor enzyme output, the immune piece. I went through treatment ( it was terrible the antibiotics), finished it in May 12 and now I’ve been in this whole rebuilding phase.

I’m about 4 months post-antibiotics and slowly seeing improvement ( I’m eating real food! ) , but I’m still sensitive. My current triggers are: •	Coffee ☕️ •    Alcohol ( wines … for some reason a tequila soda or a few doesn’t both me) •    Really acidic foods •    Random spicy/greasy stuff that just hits my stomach the wrong way

Right now I’m layering in gut supports — things like slippery elm, L-glutamine, zinc carnosine, probiotics, enzymes — and slowly figuring out what helps versus what overwhelms. Some days are better than others, but overall I can tell my gut lining is starting to heal and I’m finally absorbing nutrients again (I can see it in my energy and even muscle gain).

Still a work in progress, but if anyone else has been through the H. pylori aftermath, I’d love to hear what worked for you and what foods/supplements actually felt soothing versus irritating.

I just want to get all back together and have a strong resilient gut 🥹. I had the tiniest espresso diluted with water and it makes my stomach extend and hurt so much but once I ate a few hours later it the pain subdued.

Supplements: Slippery Elm, L-Glutamine, Zinc Probiotics (Akkermansia + Saccharomyces boulardii), Digestive Enzymes, DGL (Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Root), Colostrum (just starting).

I just feel defeated at times because I know people who had h pylori and there are like immediately fine after antibiotics and me a healthy fit individual is still suffering months later….. Maybe I had a really bad case ?? I also started eating red meat ( the doctor said I needed too after the h pylori infection)  which I didn’t eat for religious reasons but it was shocking how well my body respond to it.

A little bit of back story: one of my best friends let’s call her Mary (30F) and I (30F) are best friends since middle school. We went throughout high school together, each parents divorce, studying in universities in different cities visiting each other and talking about guys etc… Since her parents divorce 7-8 years ago her family’s economics wasn’t the best so sometimes whenever we went out for a coffee or in a restaurant (whenever it was a more special occasion like birthdays etc) I paid the bill or I got her for a birthday present whatever she needed and she couldn’t buy (like a purse etc) since I was working while studying and I was staying still with my moms house so I was making some money and saving up for trips etc.. 3-4 years ago when she finished with her uni she came back to our hometown and she started working on a bookstore and she started becoming more independent so I stopped helping out economically and whenever we went out we paid whatever we had. A couple years ago we both decided to go on a road trip in Scotland. Because she didn’t have many savings we decided to book that road trip that year (flights and hotels) so they will be more economical and I’ll help with that and she’ll pay me back her half  of those expenses later and since we’re good friends I was like let’s enjoy the trip together to spend some girls time together and reconnect! Till our trip started she gave me some money and then the trip came last October! The only issue that we had is that the car that we picked up didn’t have insurance so the car rental guy was like if there’s any issues or an accident we’ll have to pay at least 2000$ in the car rental company for the repairs, so I decided to put the extra 200$ insurance in the car that I decided to pay since I was the driver in the car for the road trip and not for any of us to pay the 2000$ extra which makes sense to me. Other than that we had a great time at our road trip and we really enjoyed it! After our trip finished she gave me a couple more times some money to pay off her part. In December last year  she got into a dancing group that she always wanted and they would go to other places and and dancing shows to show their choreography etc and I was really excited about her finally she got into something that she really wanted the last 8-10 years! 

And if you were waiting for that but here it starts…. When she started dancing the money that she owed me started to have excuses… “oh I have to pay for new dancing shoes and the dress” or “oh I have to go to Barcelona for 4 days and I have to save up for that” and “I really want to go to Israel to that dancing festival but instead I’ll go to the weekend to Budapest to see a concert”. So I told her a couple of times that “hey I’m still waiting for you to pay me up for our trip” and always the answer “I will but I’m really excited about that “ till May arrived. In May I told her because she’s traveling a lot and with her work etc I don’t think that the money for our trip will come back to me that way she will have to send me 20$-50$ per month in order to pay for what she owes me whatever she’s capable and she agreed. So in June she started paying me and I was finally relieved that I will be payed back for that trip. Until July came… I went to see my boyfriend at the start of July and when I returned she still didn’t send me the money! I waited for a couple of days and I texted her why she hasn’t paid me the at least 20$ for the trip? The answer was “oh I didn’t know that I had to pay that quick, my dad needed some money so I gave that to him. I will pay you as soon as I get paid”. That pissed me off but I waited till she paid me for the July. When she paid me I told her that I would like her to pay me on point from then on about the trip and from the summer, Christmas and Easter bonuses I would like her to pay me at least 50$-100$. (For those who don’t know in our country on the Summer and Easter we get a bonus which is half of our salary and on Christmas a whole extra salary). So she retaliated telling me that’s unfair and that she has expenses and that I’m not a good friend for asking that much money from her and that I’m being an accountant instead of a friend etc. and I told her that since I waited a year and a half since we booked our trip to finally to have a plan to pay me off and except from that I waited an extra couple weeks to get the money of course I’ll ask for my money back and be your accountantand I prefer to have my money sooner that later so we could get done with that and also she if she was a good friend of mine she should have paid her share of the car and the Parking that I paid by myself instead of splitting on which she answered that I chose to put the insurance on the car and to go park the park into Parkings instead of the street, which it pissed me off but I didn’t say anything. A couple of days pass by and because I was still on my flaming chair being pissed about the car and I was in the verge of hell breaking loose… Because in my opinion if there was an accident who is going to pay for the 2000$ that the car rental requested? Of course me and if I asked her for half the money her response would have been that I was driving and it wasn’t her fault. And for the parkings that I put the car if I put the car in the street on a town and I got fined about it again I would have paid for it because I didn’t know better. So I texted her a nice message that in resume said the below:
- I’m happy how much work you have done the last few years and the trips that you took with your friends (except me) and your dancing group and your job that you continue being good in it
- I’m sorry for being the accountant for her but I would like my money back till July 2026 whatever other thing you’re doing 
- Lastly, you’re saying that you are in economic situation and you cannot eat some days etc? (Kinda ironic since she’s been in half of Europe this year) Have you asked me how I do with my economic situation? That I have rent, gas, electricity, car loan, groceries and a dog to take care of? She is in a more advantage her living situation than me and she shouldn’t complain for the at least 20$ per month that I ask and the at least 50$ from the bonuses 3 times per year that I asked just because we are friends. So please let’s get done with that cause I don’t have anything else to say about that!

Had a very demeaning response to that of “how dare you interrupt me in my working hours “ like she couldn’t just read it when she’ll finished work. So after this whole situation she payed for August and for September and each time she asked if we could go out for a coffee…AITA that I don’t want to see her anymore because she ruined our friendship over excuses for paying me back thinking that she would have a free road trip from me and I just want to text her till she pays me off?",2,1757168772.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

There was always this older guy taking the same beginner classes as me. 

At first, he started smiling and waving at me every class we did in common, and I smiled and waved in return.

Then we started doing small talk about the weather, our jobs, exchanged our names, all very nice and polite.

We started walking back home from the classes together, since we live in the same neighbourhood.

One day, as I was going to get coffee at the end of a class, he suggested we have coffee together. I said, “well im going to get one anyway, you can tag along if you want”.

I realised then, this guy has no friends or family, and just talks and talks and talks and I couldn’t get rid of him. I had to pretend I had a delivery to attend at home.

Important context: I’m the kind of person who’s always super nice, people pleaser and I hate conflict. 
So, when confronted to this kind of talker, it feels extremely rude to cut them off and tell them I have to go. I also feel sorry he’s all alone and feel like I have to be there.

But recently, he asked for my number so we can coordinate the classes together. I didn’t see any harm in it so I gave it to him.

Since then, he hasn’t done anything wrong, but he’s become super clingy: texting me every week which classes he’s going to, asking about mine, bringing me food from his home country, staying physically close to me throughout every class, touching my arm or shoulder when he makes a joke, complimenting me on my progress at yoga, how I “look fresh” after every class, and worst of all, walking out of classes with me and entertaining a 30’ to 45’ monologue conversation that I can never manage to get out of while staying polite.

I’m sure you all have that one neighbour or family member that just talks and talks and talks and you can’t stop them.

But god I’ve got other plans than listen to a guy my father’s age talk me through how he bought his new socks in detail or how he hesitated between the blue and green bed sheets for an hour…

How do I avoid him politely?? Or at least, any ideas on how to cut short to the conversations so they don’t last as long?

I can’t just tell him “dude, you’re boring and wasting my time” when he clearly hasn’t done anything wrong…

I saw another very much alive one this morning (same counter). The exterminator sprayed poison all over the inside and outside of my house and put Advion in the cabinets near the sighting.

I live in a single house, and I'm fanatical about keeping the kitchen clean because I'm terrified of this exact thing happening. I had an actual panic attack on the first sighting.

Some questions for those who have experienced this?

1. Does seeing a very much alive roach today mean that I wasted $250? I'm wondering if I should contact another company.

2. Should we kill them if we see them, or let them be to possibly take bait back to others? (My exterminator is closed today so I can't ask them.)

3. Are there any exterminators that service the Northeast and do more than just apply poison? Specially, inspect my house to help me find an entry point that I can address? As stated, I've only seen them on one counter. No food, but my coffee pot and air fryer live there. I'm extremely attentive to cleaning my kitchen and I'm in a single home. For these reasons, I'm guessing this started from a hitch hiker, but what if it didn't?

Personal Insights

After a 7-year gap, getting back to training was mentally and physically challenging. My stamina was low, strength was gone, and it felt like starting from zero. But I stayed consistent with both my workouts and diet for 4 months, and I’m proud of the progress ... from 75kg to 82kg.

I feel stronger, healthier, and far more energetic than before. My confidence has improved a lot, and even small daily activities feel easier.

Next Goal: Continue clean bulking for a few more months, then start a slow cut to reach around 12-14% body fat while maintaining strength.",59,1757168426.0,Fitness_India,8,0.98,False

1na0qpd,https://i.redd.it/4yxdic7rzjnf1.jpeg,Cold brew - better than others,"Hey coffee lovers,
Wanted to share a little journey I’ve had with cold brew recently—and I think I might be hooked.
While traveling in Nepal, I visited a local coffee producer who introduced me to cold brew for the first time. He gave us a sample to try, and honestly, I was surprised by how smooth, soft, and non-bitter it was. Totally different from what I was used to with regular coffee or espresso.
He explained the basics of how it’s prepared—just coarse grounds, water, time, and patience—and that stuck with me.
Back home in India, I recently got my hands on some coffee beans from Mauritius and thought, why not try making it myself?
So I did.
Just mixed the grounds with water, let it sit in the fridge for over 18 hours, and strained it the next day.
And… I get it now.
The result was incredibly smooth, almost sweet, and had zero bitterness. Super refreshing and just a whole different experience from my usual brewing methods.
Honestly, I think cold brew is going to be a regular thing for me now.
Anyone else have a similar “cold brew awakening”? Would love to hear how you like to make yours, or any tips for dialing it in!",5,1757168382.0,IndiaCoffee,6,0.86,False

1na0pvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResonantRejects/comments/1na0pvo/should_best_overear_headphones_sennheiser_hd_280/,Should best over-ear headphones Sennheiser HD 280 Pro be your pick,"The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro has been my go-to pair of over-ear headphones for a few weeks now, and I have to say, they’ve impressed me in more ways than one. This model, known for its dynamic sound capabilities and durable build, caught my attention because I'm always on the lookout for high-performance headphones that can handle a multitude of tasks. The HD 280 Pro bridges the gap between professional audio use and enjoyable home listening, making it a versatile choice. But like any product, it's not flawless, and I'm here to share my experience with both the pros and cons.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out to me about the HD 280 Pro is how robust and thoughtfully designed it feels. The synthetic leatherette ear pads add a premium touch while remaining soft enough for extended use. The headphones aren't flashy, but their black, understated exterior carries a professional vibe that I appreciate. The ear cups can rotate and fold in on themselves, which makes storage super convenient, especially when I toss them into my already overcrowded backpack. Although it isn’t the lightest pair at 4.2 ounces, the weight is evenly distributed, so comfort isn't compromised during long recording or editing sessions.  

**Comfort for Long Sessions**  
The comfort factor deserves a mention because I often wear headphones for hours on end, whether it's for critical listening or casual binge-watching. I have larger-than-average ears, yet the oval earpiece shape and the ample padding fit just right without overwhelming me or feeling too tight. However, the faux leather material does tend to make my ears warm after prolonged use, which might be a limitation for those in hot climates or with sensitive skin. While it's not a dealbreaker, it's something to keep in mind if you plan to wear these for extended periods in warm conditions.  

**Sound Isolation and Accuracy**  
These headphones excel in noise isolation. I tested them in various environments, from my quiet home office to a bustling coffee shop, and they delivered consistently good ambient noise attenuation. For studio use or DJ monitoring, this feature is invaluable. Once I had the headphones on, external distractions practically vanished, allowing me to focus solely on the sound. Speaking of sound, the linear reproduction amazed me. It doesn’t exaggerate bass or treble, making it perfect for critical listening and mixing tasks where you want accuracy over flamboyance. That said, if you're someone who enjoys a bass-heavy sound signature, you may find this pair lacking in that department.  

**Connectivity and Use Cases**  
As a wired headphone, the HD 280 Pro offers reliable audio transmission with zero latency, which is ideal for professional use. The 3.5mm jack and included screw-type 1/4 adaptor make it compatible with a variety of devices, from tablets to mixers. I primarily used them during podcast editing and monitoring vocal tracks, and the clarity was spot on. It’s also versatile enough for home listening, though it's overkill if you’re just planning to watch the occasional Netflix movie. Moreover, since it doesn't feature wireless connectivity, you do lose out on the freedom of movement that Bluetooth headphones provide.

[Grab Sennheiser HD 280 Pro at the best price on Amazon.](https://dgshopper.com/p/b00it0ihoy/)

**Strong Points**  
- Impressive ambient noise cancellation  
- Precise and linear audio reproduction fit for professional tasks  
- Soft, collapsible, and rotatable ear cups for convenience  
- Durable, high-quality materials  
- Flexible compatibility with included 1/4-inch screw-type connector  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Can feel a bit warm on the ears during lengthy use  
- No wireless or noise-canceling tech for modern conveniences  
- Design might appear too plain for some users  
- Single-sided cable is fixed and not detachable  

**Competing Products**  
When it comes to alternatives, the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X is the first that comes to mind. It's often compared to this model in forums and reviews due to its similar target audience. While the Audio-Technica has a slightly bass-forward sound signature and a detachable cable, I found the isolation on the HD 280 Pro superior for professional use. Another competitor is the Sony MDR-7506, a studio classic known for its lightweight design and crisp highs. It's great for mixing, but lacks the same level of durability and noise isolation, which makes the HD 280 Pro better suited for noisy environments. The Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro deserves an honorable mention for its comfort and premium build, though it doesn’t offer the same foldable portability. Between these options, what stood out for me was how versatile and reliable the Sennheiser felt for both professional and home settings.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
In terms of cost efficiency, these headphones punch above their price. Whether you're a professional in need of consistent sound reproduction or someone looking for a great pair of headphones to handle music, movies, and more, they check most boxes. They don't come with the bells and whistles like wireless connectivity or built-in assistants, but that simplicity adds to their reliability. Is it an investment worth making? Absolutely, especially if you value clean sound over flashy features.

1na0pci,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1na0pci/i_have_been_told_that_god_wants_to_use_me_for/,"I have been told that God wants to use me for deliverance ministry. I feel so much pressure from God, I can't sleep and I have anxiety attacks from it. It is all I think about.","
So last year, I had 3 dreams of me casting demons out of people and that is when I was told that God wants to use me for deliverance ministry. Before I start explaining them, I would like to say that during that time, I was watching a lot of deliverance videos and I was kind of obsessed with spiritual warfare. Not sure if it was because of that that I was dreaming those dreams or because God sent them to me. These dreams were a couple of months apart from  eachother.

So the first dream was me standing in a long line to get into a store that had opened. A drunk man was walking past the line to go home or something. Right when he was about to pass me, he stopped right next to me and starting screaming at me and cursing me and saying that he hates me. In the dream, I knew that this must be a demon so I starting rebuking him and when I did, I felt this fire and power rush from me and he got scared and fell to the ground. I ignored him but then I had the thought of casting out the demon out of this man and I starting commanding it to go out and he started manifesting on the ground and screaming but the demom didnt come out and that if where the dream ended.

Second dream. I was sitting in a cafe drinking coffee and at the table next to me was a couple that was part of the LQBTQ+ community. They were treating the waitress in a poor manner which got me a little mad so I went up to them to confront them about it. Then I left the table to go out and one of them stood up and told me ""wait"". And they told that they needed help and out of nowhere they started manifesting and I starting praying over them and thats where the dream ended.

Third dream was about my ex boyfriends current girlfriend. So long story about what happened with my ex boyfriend and I but he was kind of a satanist and I have heard rumors that his current girlfriend is a witch. So the dream was that I entered into this fancy restaurant by myself to eat. And inside was them eating together at a table. I ignored them and walked past them to go sit at my table. She saw me and gave me a death stare. When I sat down, she came to sit down right in front of me and started telling me a bunch of stuff of how jealous she is that I was his girlfriend and she was getting kind of annying and starting to make a scandal. So I told her to calm down and then I told her ""have you heard of witcraft?"". Then she got quiet all of the sudden and starting whispering stuff to me that I couldn't hear so I suspected that she waa casting a spell on me so I told her that I knew what she waa doing and she got scared and ran back to her table. I decided to get up and follow her and she startes manifesting on the ground so I started praying over her and thats where the dream ended.

On my last post, it was a post about if we should obey our pastors all the time and it was about the pastor that I met. But I didnt mention this part in the post, please go see it if you can. I told him about my dreams and he said that God wants to use me fro deliverance ministry. And he started pressuring me to go to church everyday (please check my last post so you know what I am talking about) so God could use me. He told me that God wants to baptize me in the fire of the holy spirit. I never even had experience with anything like this so I was starting to freak out. This news does not get me exited, but gives me anxiety. It was this year around march when I told him this but since then, I cannot stop thinking about this anxiously.

 I ended up leaving his church. But I have panick attacks now. I couldnt sleep last night and I felt this pressure in my chest and my heart was beating so much. I do not know what to do with this info. I dont when to cast out a demon out of someone or out of who. What if my whole life just becomes about casting demons out of people and I get obssed with spiritual warfare and I forget about God? I have been also avoiding church because of this. And I do not even know what church to go to. I am scares of going to calm loving church because what if they wont equip me for ministry and God will get angry at me for it? But I also dont want to go to a church that pressures me so much about it. Its like I dint have peace about going to church because unless it doesnt let me cast demons out of people, God doesnt want me there. I dont know what to do. I just feel this constant pressure like this is what following God is all about. 

I even skipped visiting my grandparents in Florida this year (which I go every year) because I thought I would delay Gods purpose for me.",1,1757168282.0,TrueChristian,3,1.0,False
1na0p1a,https://i.redd.it/cidlia4ezjnf1.jpeg,Review #36: Balcones “1” Texas Single Malt Whiskey,"Distillery:  Balcones

ABV: 53% (106 proof)

Age: 48 months

Mash bill: 100% Scottish golden promise malted barley

Casks: 240-500L new American oak casks

Price: $45 (Boston, MA)

Sampling method: neat in a glencairn

Color: 1.8 Old Oak

Nose: first whiff is a funky orange marmalade on sourdough toast. There’s some darker fruits that are unmistakably figs. And then there’s some dark coffee / toffee notes that merge together into something like a tiramisu. 

Palate: It’s a very fruit-forward and slightly funky dram. It’s like you made a jelly out of blackberries, figs, and orange peel, added some port, and then let it sit out in the sun for an hour or two. Underneath all the fruitiness you have some typical new oak flavors you find in bourbon - cocoa, tobacco, baking spices, and oak - that are decently pronounced given the Texas heat.

Finish: long finish, and decently sweet, like stewed figs and marzipan. 

Rating: 7.5/10 This is a uniquely Texas single malt. Balcones did a fantastic job of using the Texas heat to their advantage to get some incredible flavor and complexity into their whiskey in a relatively short time.

Value: 5/5 At $45 this seems a steal. At normal retail price of $60 I’d still say it’s still a good value. There aren’t many of ASMWs that compete in terms of flavor at this price point. My only other Balcones I can compare it to is the Cataleja at $130, and while I like the Cataleja better (full review coming soon), it’s not 3X better or even 2X better.

I've used the Aeropress for about 5 years and still love it, but out of curiosity (and somewhat to please my girlfriend who considers my Aeropress brews that would raise the dead 'too weak') decided to jump into a world of hurt - espresso.

I'm a fiddly person, I like the manual, artisanal process as much as I do the product, so decided to go for the ROK Espresso GC.

As for grinders, I started with the cheap IKEA one - which I used with the Aeropress for 4 years before deciding it was time to upgrade and boy did that worth it. Now using a 6-bladed stainless steel conical burr hand grinder from Aliexpress with much delight, it feels good quality and grinds coffee effortlessly and in good consistency... for the Aeropress.

The ROK I'm just unable to make it consistently hit 9 bars, even at the very finest setting (grinding for around 3 minutes), which is so powdery it starts clumping on its own. I've tried from soft to steamroller-level tamping, slightly larger grind sizes, varying coffee amounts (15-20 g), 15-60 second pre-infusions, pre-heating everything, using hot enough water. No dice, the pressure gauge barely hits 5 bars and there is never any initial resistance to pulling. The best result I got was when using the finest setting I'd pulled on the levers a bit, then waited for a few seconds then pulled hard. That was the only way it even touched 9 bars, but only for a second. The result came close to being espresso, but it wasn't.

Can we absolutely conclude that the grinder is not up for the task? Am I missing something obvious with the technique? Before buying an expensive grinder I'd like to eliminate technique issues. How did you dial in your ROK espresso with an all-manual setting? Thank you for your insight.",1,1757168237.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

1na0m96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1na0m96/help_i_think_i_have_narcolepsy/,HELP i think i have narcolepsy,"I have a problem and hope someone can help. I think I could have narcolepsy?? There are some things I do that I’ve never been able to explain, and I never considered narcolepsy before because I just assumed it was where people suddenly fall asleep without warning, which doesn’t happen to me. I also have ADHD, so I don’t know if some of these things might just be because of that. I will try to be as brief as possible:

- Since I was a child I’ve always struggled to wake up and get out of bed. I am prone to falling back to sleep. My dad used to flick ice water at me until I was up, and I’d be really groggy and emotional when I woke up. Even now, I always wait until the very last minute before I urgently need to be awake. On a morning it usually takes at least 30 minutes before I feel awake enough to function, so I’m often going into work still very tired.

- I often get sudden overwhelming urges to sleep, they come on very quickly and I have to fight a lot to stay awake. I’ve fallen asleep in class before (not often, but a few times), at work if I’m sitting for too long or not engaging in anything, and on public transport/ passenger in cars I fall asleep instantly. It happened a few times when I was babysitting, like one time I took the kids to a play park and as I was watching them, an urge of tiredness swept over me and I really tried to fight falling asleep. I ended up dozing off for about a minute and a half.

- Whenever I am really laughing, like full blown belly laughing, I always fall to the floor. It doesn’t happen when I’m laughing normally, because I laugh a lot. It’s when something really funny is happening. A really vivid memory I have is when I was younger, I was about to fall off my friend’s bunkbed because I was laughing so much. I was holding on for dear life trying not to fall and pick myself up, but we were still laughing and she said something so funny that I lost the ability to use my arms, turned to jelly and fell off the bunkbed. The way I try and describe it is, it’s like being tickled but without the actual tickle sensation, or it’s like going on that ride that spins really fast and you can’t move as you’re stuck to the wall. I feel a kind of tingling sensation, usually quite strongly on my crotch too?? And it makes my muscles really weak. It’s a running joke between my friends that I am always on the floor laughing. I also completely without meaning to end up slapping my arms about, so I hit people a lot when I’m laughing, or grab onto them, unintentionally.

- Naps don’t refresh me at all. I rarely nap, because I know when I do it can’t just be for 20 minutes otherwise I feel worse when I wake up. A nap to me is 2+ hours. So many times I have went to “nap” and then just ended up sleeping until waking up the next day.

- I am tired ALL the time. I always assumed it was just my ADHD, but I don’t know what it’s like to feel awake. I am constantly aware of my eyes being relaxed as though I am about to go to sleep. It’s a running joke again that I am always tired, I’ve cancelled plans many times because I haven’t had the energy.

- My dreams are extremely vivid and very bizarre. I sometimes mistake things that happened in my dream for real life, so I’m often saying “did I dream that?”. I own a dream journal, and there are some really wacky dreams in there that are just nonsensical. I feel things in dreams as though they are real life, so I tell people that I know what it feels like to be dying or murdered because I’ve felt the emotions in dreams. 

- this one I’ve never had an explanation for, I thought it was some sort of psychosis and it terrifies me. When I’m falling asleep on a night, most of the time as I’m drifting I get jumpscared by images of eyes popping up. It isn’t me thinking about eyes, it’s them appearing in my mind when my eyes are closed. It can happen when they are open too, but it’s just very suddenly and then it’s gone, and then 5 seconds later another one will appear. It makes me jump awake, like when you feel you’re falling down stairs as you drift off and you jump awake. It’s always eyes, but sometimes it’s also dragons?? 

- I’ve had sleep paralysis 4 times to the best of my memory. One of my earliest childhood memories is of me in bed, not able to move, while three anthropomorphic tall white chickens are dancing next to my bed. I’ve seen shadows go past the hall outside my bedroom door shouting, I’ve once had a naked man come into my room and squat at the bottom of my bed grinning. I am never able to move or talk, only watch what’s happening. They only last a couple of seconds, but it’s as though it’s a real memory not a dream. 

- I talk in my sleep A LOT. It’s another running joke with friends, it’s like part of my personality at this point. We quote my sleep talking all the time. I have a recorder app that I run through the night (when I remember) and there are some really bizarre ones. Some of them are legible sentences, some of it is complete nonsense phrases, and some aren’t even words at all just gibberish, like I’m speaking a foreign language. I’ve sleepwalked a few times, apparently recently I got up to turn the fire alarm off (my boyfriend accidentally set it off). My eyes were closed and I was groaning, he tried speaking to me I didn’t respond, once I turned it off I went straight back to bed and was snoring instantly. I have NO memory of this at all!!

- I fall asleep insanely quickly, like it can happen in seconds. So many times when talking with friends about watching movies, it’s always “oh yeah I fell asleep”. I can fall asleep mid convo on a night.

- coffee has never had an affect on me. I rarely drink it, but it never makes me feel anything when I do. Same with energy drinks

- THIS is where it’s mad. I’ve never been able to explain this. Sometimes, not always but often, when I’m *doing the deed*, I get a brief but intense feeling that I am a black woman. It sounds insane, I know. It’s like for a split second, I have to remind myself that I am not black. It’s not that I’m a different person, I’m still me but I am black?? I got really scared that it could be some personality disorder. It’s happened since I started having sex. It sort of feelings the same thing as the eyes though, where it’s a very sudden feeling that happens multiple times. It’s usually like “oh man, I thought I was black again”. IT SOUNDS INSANE I KNOW!!! It’s always been that except for one time, instead of thinking I was black I thought I was ginger.

- I always sleep for at least 8 hours on a night. I make sure of it, because any less and I will not be able to function the next day. Yet I am always tired and sleep at any opportunity I have during the day, like on school trips I’d be asleep on the bus, or at the cinema, or when watching a movie in class.

- I still manage to function through the day, I don’t walk around like a zombie or like I’ve had no sleep. It’s more just the feeling of not being fully awake, or that if an opportunity arose to sleep I would take it.

- I can feel myself starting to dream on a night, I realise the thought patterns changing to sleep ones, like the beginning of dreams. I can dream as soon as I fall asleep sometimes.

- During the day when I get more tired I have strange thoughts. Not dangerous or worrying, more like utter gibberish but it makes sense to me. There have been moments where I have said something to someone completely confident that they know what I’m talking about because it makes sense to me, and then moments later I realise “wtf that didn’t make sense?” Usually my speech is more slurred, it’s very similar to how responsive I am as I begin to fall asleep on a night, or like my sleep talking phrases.

I think that’s everything, sorry for the long wall of text. Please if anybody could explain anything it would be massively appreciated. Thank you!!!",1,1757168071.0,Narcolepsy,5,1.0,False

That's just it, I'm just a writer, but I always wanted to make a VN and I already have the idea, its basically where the player goes to a coffee shop, can't leave and meets these weird demons/entities now the bad part is that I'm completely alone in this, I can't code and I can't draw (though I have made rough sketches of most characters) and I'm not good at making music either or anything, I can only write so I'm looking to make a group of 3 or 4 people to make the VN and this is more like a hobby than anything so pay will not be included, you can message me on discord at ILikeToEatToast if your interested!

so there are 6 main characters, Crayon, Silas, [Dr.Ink](http://Dr.Ink) Huckleberry (Huck), Pie, Greg and Cynthia, they all work there, Crayon mans the counter (he is the first character you meet in the VN) and Silas is a waiter, Dr. Ink makes the drinks (even though they're a doctor) Huckleberry is a customer whose there with his little sibling Pie, Greg is a robot (whose the janitor) and Cynthia is the local murderous psychopath along with Crayon! So she also works in the back.. Away from people. As it should be.",2,1757168067.0,vndevs,2,0.75,False

in the sharpness of my breath, 

like liquor

poorly masked with coffee?



on the heel of my shoe, 

like the smear of dog shit I stepped in 

before slipping in the back door, 

praying 

to go unnoticed?



~~(If you must know, I was noticed, but I was ghosted)~~



In the tang of my skin 

Ripe with sweat 

from all the pretending, trying, gaslighting and fighting,



internally dying 

after saying some stupid thing 

ten stupid things, 

regrettable things

redundant things 

that I regret?



Can they sense it? 

My ever-sighing, pining, white lying, self-chiding; 

never running, always hiding

grieving fiercely but never crying 

self



wishing I were somewhere, someone, anyone 

else



Can they see it? 

Floating around me like an orb?

Carved into my skin like ink?

Ink that’s left scars 

I’ve picked at ‘til they’ve poured.



I can see it now. I often can. 



It’s written on the mirror

in that old, familiar scrawl: 



Imposter. Do not trust. Do not let in.

Does not belong here;

Does not belong anywhere 

Or to anyone



— Least of all to herself.
