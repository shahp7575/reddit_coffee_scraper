1gnxi9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gnxi9d/i_dont_love_my_girlfriend_anymore_but_i_dont_know/,I don‚Äôt love my girlfriend anymore but I don‚Äôt know how to leave.,"I (27m) have been with my girlfriend (25f) for about 11 months now.
We used to be the perfect couple. We were that couple that our friends would point at to be described as ‚Äúrelationship goals‚Äù.
And for a while, I really believed that I would have a future with her.
But the last month or so has made me realize that she just doesn‚Äôt make me happy anymore. And to be quite honest, I no longer love her.
Last month I got a good promotion at work. And as can be expected, more money means more responsibility. I have been working 50+ hours a week because that is what my new position requires.

She does not understand that. She works a regular 9-5.
Lately she‚Äôs been starting arguments with me now about how my hours suck and she hates me working where I do because I had to sacrifice time that I would normally spend with her.

She has accused me of cheating on multiple occasions in the last month with the girls I work with simply on the basis that I happened to become good friends with them regardless of how many times I have reassured her that I am not cheating. Because I‚Äôm not. 

She gets mad at me when I get called in to work on my days off because it means she won‚Äôt get to see me. 
Which I do understand. 
However, when I told her about my promotion and new schedule and how I would be on call 24/7 and all 365 days of the year, she assured me that she didn‚Äôt mind because she was so excited for me and proud of me getting a promotion I had worked really hard for.

Just the other day she called me crying because I don‚Äôt have time to text her, call her, or leave work to go get coffee or lunch with her while I‚Äôm at work anymore, and then started yelling at me about how every day she gets ready to hang out only for me to ‚Äúcrush her expectations‚Äù by having to work early the next day or having to stay late at work.

I have had multiple conversations with her trying to explain that I don‚Äôt always have the time to talk or hang out or do anything because of work. I don‚Äôt even get to see my friends or my family or do my hobby stuff anymore because I just don‚Äôt have time for it.
It always ends the same though. She just gets upset and starts talking about how what I do isn‚Äôt fair to her because in her words, she has dreams about what kind of lifestyle she wants to have with me and I‚Äôve been making that impossible.
But her dream lifestyle is honestly pretty unrealistic. 
She wants us to spend every night together going on cute fun dates or having a night in or spending every holiday together while we save up money and then take a few months off from work to travel around the world and plan our wedding and honeymoon then get married when we come back home only to go abroad again to have the honeymoon.

I want to leave and end the relationship very badly because of this last month. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that could salvage this relationship.
I gave it everything I had. I really did. I was patient, I did everything she asked, I tried talking to her, but in my opinion she just started being selfish and quite frankly childish as well.
And I really do hate to say it but I don‚Äôt think I can continue a relationship with her.
No matter how it happens it‚Äôs sadly going to be messy. We both have a decent bit of stuff at eachother‚Äôs places and I don‚Äôt want her going behind my back and burning or throwing away my stuff in a fit of rage.
I also fear she will start showing up at my work or my place and start making scenes. Or start stalking me.",1,1731233288.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Here are my tools,"My first year sober I counted days and weeks and months as if my life depended on it. Yeah okay in some ways it did. But yesterday I plain forgot my seventh anniversary! I take that as a sign I‚Äôm doing well. Thank you all for grace and support!

I‚Äôd like to share my list of tools again, as I‚Äôve done at every major milestone for a while. Serving from the immense potluck of wisdom and experience that is this sub, I could easily extend the list, but this is the essence. This is mine.

Your sobriety is yours. Your path is your own. I am humbled and grateful to be walking it with you, and know this, my dear, somewhat random, internet friend: I believe in you. You are here, you want this, and I am certain you can get it.

Friends and fellow travellers, let‚Äôs go! I will not drink with you today!

* Step out of the shadows. Posting, commenting and being part of the community changed everything for me.

* Set a goal. One hour, one day, one week; this trip, that visit - and count your victories! Then you know you can do it the next time too.

* Moderation doesn¬¥t work. I tried it for ten years, and it only made me miserable.

* HALT. When I crave, am I really hungry, angry, lonely, tired? Staying one step ahead with some water, fruit or a snack has helped me a lot.

* Play the tape forward. What happens if I take this drink? The next hour, the next day, the next week? For me, drinking is not just about one day of hangover - it is 40 days with that voice in my head.

* Learn your triggers. Want a drink? Take a step or two backwards and see what just happened. Then, try to avoid it. It takes time to create new patterns, but it works. Knowledge is bliss.

* Allow yourself to mourn the losses. For me it¬¥s like a long and painful breakup with the love of my life. That is in addition to lost opportunities, growth, finances, relations, you name it.

* Discover new joys. I¬¥ve always loved fresh roast, hand brewed coffee; now I love it even more, particularly with the sunrise through my window.

* Afraid to fall? My motorcycle teacher taught me that if you stare at an object in the road, you will hit it. Look where you¬¥re going, not where you¬¥re not going.

* Did you fall? Don¬¥t despair. Get up. The failure isn¬¥t in falling, it¬¥s in not getting up again.

* Struggling with motivation? We all do. Go for resolution in stead. Motivation shifts, resolution stays.

* Impatient? Waiting for that spunk, clarity, weightloss, zen born again bliss peace of mind? It took time to get where you are. It will take time and work to become the person you want to be, too. But you know what? You are already on your way, and that¬¥s your doing. You can do this.

* Stressed out? Inhale grace, exhale gratitude.

**A huge shoutout to all you friends and fellow travellers here at SD, you have taught me so much! I admire your love, affection and wisdom, keeping this sub a place of beauty. I will not drink with you today!**",2,1731233260.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

Some of these might be a stretch. But the use of threes in this film is more than I've ever seen. Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius. 

Mostly in order... I'm sure I've missed some of them. Here we go:

The opening and closing theme song by Michael Penn is a waltz, in 3/3 time signature. 

Maurice says ""Jackie Jack"" 3 times in a row.

Maurice greets 3 people on the dance floor (Reed, Becky, Buck)

When Jack first sees Eddie, the camera cuts back to Eddie 3 times.

Little Bill needs to call Rocky, Scotty and Kurt. 

3 quick cuts: pills, phone, coke

Amber pleads on the phone saying ""please"" 3 times

Bill catches his wife having sex... her lover says close the door, and Bill says it two more times right after.

3 quick cuts: burner, sausages, coffee.

Eddie's Mom shakes the thermos after washing it 3 times.

3 quick cuts: employee of the month, Bucks nametag, stereo

3 quick cuts: intercom, flag/chalkboard, pee-chee folder

3 quick cuts: horse figures, awards, more horses

Eddie gets picked up by 3: Jack, Amber and Rollergirl

3 quick cuts: Colonel arriving at Jack's

Jack, Reed and Dirk are in the hot tub

Dirk, Scotty and Reed get matching outfits

Adult awards: 3 whip pans

Adult awards: Dirk bows 3 times

Dirk asks Jessie 3 questions before their sex scene

We see 3 portraits painted by Jessie in the film. 2 of Dirk, 1 of Little Bill

We see Reed perform magic 3 times in the film

Little Bill's wife has sex with 3 different people before he kills himself

Dirk has 3 AVN awards

Rollergirl and Dirk hook up 3 times in the film

The 3rd adult awards show is skipped (goes from 2 to 4)

3 quick cuts: Floyd Gondolli entrance

Amber and Dirk do coke, Amber says ""it's a surprise"" 3 times quickly

Amber and Dirk do 3 lines of coke together. Amber 1, Dirk 2

Little Bill fires 3 shots to kill his wife and lover

Jack asks Colonel ""you didn't do anything?"" 3 times in a row

Colonel asks Jack ""Am I your friend?"" 3 times in a row

3 visible camera bulb flashes at Becky and Jerome's wedding

Dirk says to Amber ""your not my Mom"" 3 times

Dirk says ""fuck you"" to Jack 3 times in a row

Amber and Rollergirl do 3 lines of coke together

Todd, Reed and Dirk do 3 lines of coke together

Amber high with Rollergirl: ""go, go, go""

""Explain it to him in simple arithmetic 1, 2, 3""

Buck says ""I'm an actor"" 3 times in a row

Jack films porno in the limo: ""ok, ok, ok""

Rollergirl says hi to the camera 3 times in the limo (hi, hello, howdy)

Dude in truck with Dirk tells him what to do 3 times

College guy asks Rollergirl 3 questions in the limo

Dude tells Dirk what to do again 3 more times

3 people are in the front of the limo: Jack, the driver and Rocky

Dirk says to the guy in the truck ""I can't"" 3 times in a row

The truck that pulls up to beat up Dirk has 3 guys in it. 

Rollergirl says ""you don't ever disrespect me, fucker"" 3 times (slight variations)

Jessie and Buck say ""kyawh"" 3 times at the donut shop

Gun lover shoots his gun 3 times in the donut shop

3 quick cuts of the motel Reed, Dirk and Todd are in

Dirk, Todd and Reed go to rip off Rahad

Throughout the film, Dirk says ""I was born ready"" 3 times

3 different songs play in Rahads house

Todd says ""I want what's in the floor safe"" or some variation 3 times in a row

3 actors in Bucks commercial

3 person crew for Bucks commercial (Scotty, Kurt, Amber)

Jack tells Amber how hot she is 3 times throughout the film

Dirk looking in the mirror: ""so I'm gonna be nice"" 3 times in a row

Now I'll point out the names in the film that all have 3 syllables, which is almost everyone:

Dirk Diggler
Brock Landers
Reed Rothchild
Chest Rockwell
Jack Horner
Amber Waves
Rollergirl
Little Bill
Todd Parker
Sheryl Lynn
Colonel James
Kurt Longjohn
Scotty Jay

Things in threes are always more memorable. Maybe intentional, maybe not. But it's still genius.

Lastly, the title of the film is also 3 syllables.

And as an aside for some trivia, does anyone know the reason the Boogie Nights sign at the beginning was specifically  made and put on film?

Despite the rain, there's no need to feel downcast! The gentle pitter-patter on the rooftops can create a soothing ambiance, perfect for a relaxing evening in with a good book or movie.

","A very long post ahead, read only if you want to understand fat loss and make your life healthy. 

Recently, my friend was suffering from severe pain near his armpits due to an infection in his lymph nodes. When we visited the doctor, she told us that obesity could be one of the reasons and asked him to lose weight. He is 24 years old, almost 100 kg, and 5 feet 6 inches tall. My friend‚Äôs mother is feeling very sad and asked me to advise him on his health. I am not a nutritionist or a gym trainer, but I am someone who has become fit after losing almost 20 kg over a period of 5 months and has maintained the same body weight for the last 4 months, while reducing body fat percentage. I have learned a lot about fat loss and the importance of building muscle over the last 11 months. I don‚Äôt want people to end up like my friend. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people who need advice on where to start and how to lose fat. So, this post is for them.

Firstly, let‚Äôs understand the difference between weight loss and fat loss. Weight loss may consist of losing water weight, losing fat, losing muscle mass, etc. Fat loss is specifically losing body fat. Water weight refers to the extra water that your body has stored because of various factors like a bad diet, stress, etc. So, what we need to do here is lose fat, lose water weight, and build muscle to get our body toned.

When I say building muscle, a lot of my women friends feel like, ‚ÄúNahh, it isn‚Äôt for me. I don‚Äôt want to become a muscle queen and show my muscles like a man.‚Äù I think many women feel the same way, but what they don‚Äôt realize is that it takes a lot of time and effort to build that kind of muscle mass. Women need to build muscle as well, especially when dealing with PCOS/PCOD and a lot of other issues. I guess I need not write anything about the importance of muscle for a man. When there is good muscle mass in our (man or woman) body, our metabolism increases, and when we eat a few more calories, it helps in maintaining our body without increasing body fat.

Another thing about fat loss is that there is no spot reduction. You just can‚Äôt reduce fat near your stomach, arms, or anywhere else in the body intentionally. The simple point is that when body fat increases, it doesn‚Äôt increase at specific points but increases across the body, and it‚Äôs the same during fat loss as well. You can only drop fat, but you cannot spot reduce fat. Please keep this in mind. If someone tells you about any exercise to reduce the fat near your stomach or any other body part, just keep them away from your life.

Let‚Äôs understand how fat loss works. The keyword for fat loss is calorie deficit. If you ask me what exactly a calorie deficit is, it just means putting your body in a deficit in the amount of energy it needs. So, let‚Äôs just say your body needs 2100 kcal every day, and you eat a maximum of 1900 kcal. Your body is going to be in a deficit of 200 calories. If you spend some time in the gym every day, and let‚Äôs just assume you burn 300 kcal in the gym, this means that you‚Äôve burned an extra 300 kcal. Overall, your body is going to be in a deficit of 500 kcal. Your body needs to survive even if it‚Äôs in a deficit, and that‚Äôs when it starts burning fat to cover that gap. If you maintain a 500 kcal deficit every day for 16 days, you will be in a calorie deficit of 8000 kcal overall. This means that at the end of 16 days, your body burns 8000 kcal of body fat to cover the gap created by the calorie deficit. 1 kg of fat contains 7700 kcal of energy, and this means that at the end of 16 days, you will lose approximately 1 kg of body fat. This is the fundamental principle of fat loss.

As we understood fat loss, let‚Äôs move on to how to build muscle. Resistance training is the answer. What comes under resistance training are weight training, yoga, calisthenics, etc. Yoga and calisthenics are nothing but bodyweight training since you deal with your own body weight in them. They are relatively tougher than lifting weights in the gym. So, choose your option for resistance training wisely. I prefer lifting weights in the gym. When you lift weights or do resistance training, the muscles that are being targeted will break down internally, and when you eat protein-rich food, it helps repair/build that muscle. That‚Äôs how muscle building works. When you do progressive overloading with the weights, your strength is going to increase as well. So, this infers that you break muscles in the gym and build muscles in the kitchen, and that brings us to the diet.

Maintaining a clean diet is very, very important during fat loss until you understand how your body works. If you ask me, ""Can‚Äôt we do fat loss by eating sweets, pizza, ice cream, etc.?"" Sure, we can, but that‚Äôs a different thing entirely. Let‚Äôs just say you ate a Magnum ice cream, which is approximately 100 kcal, and you‚Äôve cut a chapathi to maintain the balance. The question that now comes up is: can we feel full with an ice cream in place of chapathi? Obviously, NO. We crave more food to fill our stomach, and we start binge eating, which increases body weight even more due to a calorie surplus. So, I would advise you to stay away from these junk foods until you understand how your body works.

The food that you eat mainly consists of macronutrients and micronutrients. Macros are nothing but basically carbs, protein, and fats. Micronutrients are minerals and vitamins. You need not care much about micros unless there is a specific deficiency in your body that you need to address. We need to be careful about the macros in our food. The basic funda for fat loss is to cut carbs, increase protein, and ensure that the overall calories you intake through your food stay within the limit you set. When I say cut carbs, don‚Äôt just stop eating rice, chapathi, or any other carb source. Carbs are very, very important for our body. Carbs are like fuel for our body‚Äîwe can‚Äôt function properly if we don‚Äôt eat carbs. Protein is like that bike mechanic who helps repair the broken parts (muscles in our body). So, find the right balance between carbs and protein.

How much protein does our body need? Ideally, at least your body weight (in kg) √ó 1.2 g. If you weigh 80 kg, your body needs at least 96g of protein. The protein-rich foods are tofu, paneer, chicken, etc. 100g of chicken contains 27‚Äì30g of protein for 250 kcal of energy. Paneer and tofu have different values. Find the protein-rich foods, include them in your diet, and customize the remaining calories with carbs and fats.

An example diet looks like below.

`Pre-workout: black coffee+banana. Black coffee helps in activating the brain and banana gives the instant energy which helps in workout.`

`Breakfast: 1 Apple/Guava/Pomegranate/any good fruit+ (200ml milk+35g oats) + 2-3 baadam + 3-4 egg whites. Eggs are the protein source here. 1 egg white consists of 3g of protein and a whole egg consists of 6g of protein. The yellow part consists of good fats/ protein as well but high in calories. You can add them according to your needs.`

`Lunch: 200g rice+some curry+100g chicken/tofu/paneer/scoop of whey protein. Rice is carbs source and chicken/tofu/whey is protein source.`

`Snacks: 200g of watermelon or keera or carrots or some low calorie veggies/fruits.`

`Dinner: 2 roti+some curry+ 100g chicken/tofu/paneer/scoop of whey protein. Roti is carb source and chicken/tofu/whey is protein source.`

If you calculate the calories of the above food, it‚Äôs going to be approximately less than 1900-2000 kcal. You can add poha in place of roti or any carb source that you wish, and tofu in place of chicken or any other good protein source. I shared this diet as an example with someone, and he asked me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve given me a diet for one day, what about the other days?‚Äù I laughed. Please don‚Äôt be like that guy. Do your research and customize your diet according to your needs. If you want someone to customize your diet for you, reach out to a nutritionist and pay them. If you want to save your money, do your research and customize it yourself, or you can eat the same thing every single day. There is no need to eat different things on different days unless you crave something different. I eat the same thing almost every single day.

One question that many people have doubts about is, Is whey protein good? You should avoid people who say that it‚Äôs bad for health. No, it isn‚Äôt bad for health. It‚Äôs literally made out of milk and is completely natural. Let‚Äôs just say your body has a vitamin D deficiency, and you visited a doctor. Your doctor advised you to take vitamin D as a supplement. Does that make the doctor who referred you to that supplement bad, or do you become bad when you take that supplement? NO. Similarly, your body needs protein as well, and many people don‚Äôt have the time to cook or don‚Äôt have the appetite to eat chicken, tofu, etc. daily. They can absolutely take a scoop of whey protein instead of eating chicken/tofu. The only disadvantage is that it‚Äôs a bit expensive compared to chicken/tofu, and if you can afford it, you can have it without any second thoughts. Taking a scoop of whey is not mandatory if you can hit your protein goal with foods like chicken/tofu/etc. Again, whey protein is completely NATURAL.

The above piece of text contains solid information about fat loss. Many people might not believe me, but all those Instagram nutritionists and trainers charge thousands and don‚Äôt even share basic information like this. Many trainers in gyms also don‚Äôt understand basics like this and give bad advice. So, don‚Äôt believe anyone blindly and do your research before you start practicing something.

Also, you need not do heavy deadlifts or deadlifts for that matter in the gym to build muscle. No exercise is mandatory in the gym for building muscle if you can‚Äôt do deadlifts/squats with proper form. It‚Äôs completely fine‚Äîlook for safer alternatives. Please remember that powerlifting and muscle building are different things. Surely, there are specific advantages to squats/deadlifts, but if you are getting hurt because of them, it‚Äôs completely fine not to do them.

Another important factor in this journey is discipline and consistency. This journey is a marathon. You will see almost no progress in terms of results for the first 2 months, but believing in the process and consistently doing what you are doing is the only way forward. If you stop in between, you will go back to zero. Keep doing something even when you don‚Äôt want to, so that you can achieve a greater good for yourself. That‚Äôs what discipline is. Don‚Äôt be undisciplined and never stop believing in yourself.

What helped me personally was a 100-day challenge. During those 100 days, I didn‚Äôt touch junk food, ice cream, or sugar, and I stuck to my diet strictly. I never missed a single gym session in those 100 days. I took photos of myself every single day and tracked my progress. Whenever I felt demotivated, I looked at those pictures and lifted myself up. So, set a challenge for yourself, track your progress, and see the results.

Hope this post helps the people who are willing to start, don‚Äôt know where to start and need that one mighty push. I hope this post acts as that push.

I have added information about the basics that one should be aware of before starting fat loss, and sure, there is much more to learn beyond this. Also, people who want to add something or correct something in this post, please add it in the comments.",4,1731232737.0,hyderabad,0,1.0,False

Please don‚Äôt ask TL;DR for this.  
  
Recently, my friend was suffering from severe pain near his armpits due to an infection in his lymph nodes. When we visited the doctor, she told us that obesity could be one of the reasons and asked him to lose weight. He is 24 years old, almost 100 kg, and 5 feet 6 inches tall. My friend‚Äôs mother is feeling very sad and asked me to advise him on his health. I am not a nutritionist or a gym trainer, but I am someone who has become fit after losing almost 20 kg over a period of 5 months and has maintained the same body weight for the last 4 months, while reducing body fat percentage. I have learned a lot about fat loss and the importance of building muscle over the last 11 months. I don‚Äôt want people to end up like my friend. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people who need advice on where to start and how to lose fat. So, this post is for them.

Firstly, let‚Äôs understand the difference between weight loss and fat loss. Weight loss may consist of losing water weight, losing fat, losing muscle mass, etc. Fat loss is specifically losing body fat. Water weight refers to the extra water that your body has stored because of various factors like a bad diet, stress, etc. So, what we need to do here is lose fat, lose water weight, and build muscle to get our body toned.

When I say building muscle, a lot of my women friends feel like, ‚ÄúNahh, it isn‚Äôt for me. I don‚Äôt want to become a muscle queen and show my muscles like a man.‚Äù I think many women feel the same way, but what they don‚Äôt realize is that it takes a lot of time and effort to build that kind of muscle mass. Women need to build muscle as well, especially when dealing with PCOS/PCOD and a lot of other issues. I guess I need not write anything about the importance of muscle for a man. When there is good muscle mass in our (man or woman) body, our metabolism increases, and when we eat a few more calories, it helps in maintaining our body without increasing body fat.

Another thing about fat loss is that there is no spot reduction. You just can‚Äôt reduce fat near your stomach, arms, or anywhere else in the body intentionally. The simple point is that when body fat increases, it doesn‚Äôt increase at specific points but increases across the body, and it‚Äôs the same during fat loss as well. You can only drop fat, but you cannot spot reduce fat. Please keep this in mind. If someone tells you about any exercise to reduce the fat near your stomach or any other body part, just keep them away from your life.

Let‚Äôs understand how fat loss works. The keyword for fat loss is calorie deficit. If you ask me what exactly a calorie deficit is, it just means putting your body in a deficit in the amount of energy it needs. So, let‚Äôs just say your body needs 2100 kcal every day, and you eat a maximum of 1900 kcal. Your body is going to be in a deficit of 200 calories. If you spend some time in the gym every day, and let‚Äôs just assume you burn 300 kcal in the gym, this means that you‚Äôve burned an extra 300 kcal. Overall, your body is going to be in a deficit of 500 kcal. Your body needs to survive even if it‚Äôs in a deficit, and that‚Äôs when it starts burning fat to cover that gap. If you maintain a 500 kcal deficit every day for 16 days, you will be in a calorie deficit of 8000 kcal overall. This means that at the end of 16 days, your body burns 8000 kcal of body fat to cover the gap created by the calorie deficit. 1 kg of fat contains 7700 kcal of energy, and this means that at the end of 16 days, you will lose approximately 1 kg of body fat. This is the fundamental principle of fat loss.

As we understood fat loss, let‚Äôs move on to how to build muscle. Resistance training is the answer. What comes under resistance training are weight training, yoga, calisthenics, etc. Yoga and calisthenics are nothing but bodyweight training since you deal with your own body weight in them. They are relatively tougher than lifting weights in the gym. So, choose your option for resistance training wisely. I prefer lifting weights in the gym. When you lift weights or do resistance training, the muscles that are being targeted will break down internally, and when you eat protein-rich food, it helps repair/build that muscle. That‚Äôs how muscle building works. When you do progressive overloading with the weights, your strength is going to increase as well. So, this infers that you break muscles in the gym and build muscles in the kitchen, and that brings us to the diet.

We crave more food to fill our stomach, and we start binge eating, which increases body weight even more due to a calorie surplus. So, I would advise you to stay away from these junk foods until you understand how your body works.

The basic funda for fat loss is to cut carbs, increase protein, and ensure that the overall calories you intake through your food stay within the limit you set.

I think I might have manifested a crush fromnthe past instead of the crush I have in the present time.

I met this girl 7 years ago in the company I was working with. When I first met her, I was a tenured employee and she was a newbie. It just happened that we met near a locker area where she asked if I somehow knew where she could grab some coffee. My eyes were glued on her eyes, and tell you what, I have never seen anyone look at me in the eyes with those glares, like they looked at me with feelings inside them. On that day, we chatted a bit, and when she knew where my address was at, she invited me to commute home with her. So I did. Fast forward, I got to know her more. Until I quit work due to the toxic environment I was in. 
After that, I never heard from her again. 

Just about 2 days ago, I was grabbing coffee from a shop downstairs in the new company I was working in when I stepped out of the elevator with several people about to go down. I somehow saw a glimpse of a familiar face but I was distracted by a colleague who talked to me in a short while.
Just when I was about to leave, someone suddenly pulled on my sleeve and poked my arm. When I looked back, low and behold, there she was, standing just right outside the locker area with me holding iced coffee, meeting the very same smiling eyes. Her aura never changed. Her character was the very same character I met 7 years ago but got more mature and.. still pretty after all this time while I looked like a dinosaur fed with depression.

We had a conversation that took a couple of minutes longer, I learned that she quit the job after her trainer had beef with her for some weird reason and she never went back to work again and opted to finish school instead. 7 years later, her cousin invited her to apply on the same company where I am currently working in.

Look, the company had a mass hiring event. For months. And the account I was in is closing the hiring. Like it was just 1 batch away to close compared to others that were still open. And she had to be where I was? The same company, the same account, the same situation, the same scenario that happened 7 years ago. She used to be my apprentice back at my old company, and this time she's an apprentice of my team too.

Who would have thought that she's quit the company I quitted and went back to work just to find me on the same place, same floor building, same account, same everything? 

She even invited me to come home together but this time, she said she has her bike, and wants to wait for me till I end my shift. Crazy isn't it? 

She said she's been checking on my FB account and posts but I seriously forgot she even existed, and then here we are with all of these going on üò≠

As per the connection, I have never felt more connected with anyone than with her. Maybe because I was so interested in her back then, it drove me mad and confused on what I should feel.

She texted me and said she was so hapoy to see me again. and, low and behold, we're both girls. I'm bisexual. I don't know her preference but i'd say she's straight.. or i don't know. I can't assume.

We're both confused and shocked why this all happened but, what do you guys think?

So this situation began Monday night I was very anxious about something in my personal life, I went to the gym and felt a bit nauseous but I got home and ate some spicy ramen with cheese, egg and crispy onions for dinner, that‚Äôs when the pain started in my stomach like the diarrrea type of tummy ache. 

I woke up for work on the Tuesday and had my morning coffee and croissant, about 2 hours after the pain started again and I had to use the toilet. The bowel movement was normal, but I still had this pain. I went again to the toilet about 5 times that day and each time the bowel movement was normal but I had cramps constantly to go. Wednesday came around and I felt better, slightly nauseous but no bowel movements, Thursday and Friday I also felt better and no bowel movements but very decreased appetite on both days. 

Yesterday (Saturday) I ate breakfast and a coffee, then about 2 and a half hours later the need to go for a bowel movements and the pain started again. The cramps didn‚Äôt get better after I went  for a bowel movement and they carried on all day, I went to the toilet about 7 times in total and they were mostly just soft bowel movements not necessarily diarrrea. But the cramps and pain just will not go away, I‚Äôve woke up now on Sunday and the cramps are still here and I‚Äôve had to go to the toilet AGAIN. 

I have been very constipated for the past couple of months where I was not passing more than 2 stools a week and they were not very satisfying. Could it be my body just expelling all of the back up in the my intestines? And could that cause constant cramps and stomach ache for 2 days? and for 6 days to be feeling off.

Here‚Äôs why!,"Has anyone else experienced this or is feeling the same way? Please let me know, because I‚Äôm genuinely curious.

To start, Bumble BFF has been quite a frustrating experience for me, or maybe it‚Äôs just the way women are on there. I‚Äôve been using the app for a year now, really trying to make friends and putting in the effort, but it‚Äôs been super exhausting to say the least.

It seems a lot of women aren‚Äôt serious!

I‚Äôm in my 30s, straight, a Leo, outgoing, an ambivert, and a mum. I live in London, UK, love a good laugh, socialising, and keeping things positive and peaceful. I‚Äôm also a coffee addict, ha! But I mainly joined Bumble BFF because I realised I don‚Äôt really have any close friends, just acquaintances.

My best friend of 17 years and I ended our friendship four years ago because of her constant boundary-crossing and dishonesty. I grieved that friendship for years, and when I was ready, I thought, ‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôd love a new best friend.‚Äù

Since joining, I‚Äôve matched with loads of women who say they‚Äôre looking for a bestie, feel like it‚Äôs harder to make real friends as we get older, and say they want someone who actually wants to hang out.

I was thrilled to find other women who seemed to be in the same boat! Many shared their friendship struggles, talked about how rare it is to meet people in person these days, and so on.

But what I‚Äôve actually experienced over the past year has been pretty disheartening. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed with a lot of women who ‚Äúclaim‚Äù they‚Äôre looking for real friends and want to meet up in person:

‚Ä¢ Many say they want friends but never actually make the effort to meet.

‚Ä¢ Some will chat for weeks with no real intention of hanging out.

‚Ä¢ Some ask for your number and then barely bother to keep in touch.

‚Ä¢ Some reply as if they‚Äôre on a dating app, taking 5-10 business days to respond to a simple ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks. How are you?‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Some want to be your pen pal but don‚Äôt tell you that. So they take your number and message or voice note you for months, and now you‚Äôre in pen-pal mode, even though you‚Äôve mentioned meeting up. There‚Äôs always something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy that week‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do lunch next Thursday,‚Äù only for them to cancel days before, so it becomes the same thing every month. Meanwhile, you know everything about their life through a phone. That‚Äôs a pen pal, not a friend!

‚Ä¢ Some women who talk to you consistently for weeks, and you think you‚Äôre becoming cool, set up plans, only to cancel at the last minute with pathetic a** excuses.

For example, I once made plans with a woman for coffee, and I was genuinely excited, thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe this BFF thing actually works!‚Äù But on the morning of our meet-up, as I‚Äôm updating her on my whereabouts, she suddenly says, ‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt come because my boyfriend‚Äôs just shown up.‚Äù This was at 11 a.m., and we were supposed to meet at 12! My response was, ‚Äúcool.‚Äù I was pissed!

It was so disrespectful. I‚Äôd never do that to someone. If she didn‚Äôt want to go, she could have just said so days prior. It made me wonder if she always drops people for her boyfriend. Would I even want that in a friend? Absolutely NOT! We‚Äôre not 15! I decided to leave it and never reached out to her again. I‚Äôm the type who values honesty, manners, and accountability, and when I felt disrespected like that, it was just hurtful.

In the end, I feel like many women on that app aren‚Äôt serious. Some seem to be bored, others might be lonely, and a few, like me, genuinely want to find authentic and real friends which honestly seems very rare and hard to find these days.

I think I‚Äôm at the point now that I may not ever have real friends like that and I have to learn to just deal with it. It‚Äôs sad even saying this because for god sake I‚Äôm a grown a** woman but everyone needs friends. 

What‚Äôs your experience been? I‚Äôd love to hear about it. ü§ç",2,1731230606.0,BumbleGirls,0,1.0,False
1gnww0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/M_novels/comments/1gnww0p/the_victims_p1_edited/,The victims p1 - edited,"Rain-soaked and grim, the night held its breath. Two empty eyes stared up at the sky, a pale, greyish face reflected in the wet pavement. Simple but structured clothing clung to the still form, a body splayed out in a macabre parody of a cross. The only sound was the steady patter of rain and the distant hum of sirens, their red and blue lights painting an eerie glow over the deserted street.

A lone car splashed through the downpour, its tires sending plumes of water flying. Inside, two female investigators, bound together by the unbreakable bonds of their work. One slept fitfully, The other, her eyes fixed intently on the road, her face a map of stress and fatigue.

The driver, a woman in her early thirties, was a picture of elegance. Her features, like her clothing, were delicate, harmonious, with not a single note out of place. She was the embodiment of grace under pressure.

Her partner was a different story altogether. Sleep had not been kind to her, deep frowns etched into her face, her age impossible to discern. Some might have placed her in her late thirties, others in her early forties. But one thing was certain - this was a woman who carried her burdens heavily, even in rest.

The car slowed to a stop, and the driver reached over to gently shake her partner awake. With a groggy start, the other woman hauled herself out of the car, her body unfolding like a puppet on a string. She stretched, yawned, her joints cracking in protest like an old wooden ship straining against its moorings. Days of catching what rest she could in the car seats, or collapsing onto the creaky sofa in her office, had taken their toll.

As she worked out the kinks, a vow formed in her mind. As soon as this case was solved, things would change. The junk food would go, the gym would beckon. Nights would be spent tucked up at home, mornings would start with birdsong and coffee. The masseuse would become her new best friend.

A snort of laughter came from the driver: ""S., do you really think you'll stick to it this time? The promises to yourself, the vows to turn your life around?""

S. 's eyes narrowed: ""Bitch, are you eavesdropping on my thoughts now?""

The driver held up her hands in a gesture of innocence: ""No, but I have this aunt, see...she's always making these grand plans to turn her life around. To quit the smokes, to take up yoga, to eat more greens. But it never happens, not until she's forced into it by circumstance.""

S. 's face darkened: ""Sh., Did you just compare me to your doddering old aunt?! You know I've got my Glock, and my marksmanship scores are always top of the class. 

Sh. hrugged: ""I also know that the total number of rounds fired from our weapons is 8, none of which were fired from yours. And I also know you're not going to find a new partner, no matter how many threats you make.""

S. huffed, crossing her arms. ""Oh, I'll find someone. Someone younger, someone fitter, someone who can actually keep up with me.""

Sh. Just laughed. ""Good luck with that, S. You won't find better than me. I'm the only one who can tolerate your crap, and you know it.""

And with that, the two detectives stepped out into the rain, ready to face whatever the night held. They knew the threats were empty, the promises nothing more than air. After four years, they knew each other too well. They knew that no matter what, they'd always have each other's backs, that they'd always move forward together, two pieces of a larger whole.

And she responds saying the age of consent is 17 and it‚Äôs all legal and can we at least chat and be friends. 

I told her that‚Äôs well and dandy but I don‚Äôt want to do anything that is illegal. I‚Äôm not trying to go to jail etc. 

She says that‚Äôs perfectly fine, let‚Äôs still get coffee (we had planned this before her bombshell) and then next thing I know I‚Äôm getting nudes from her (no face). 

I immediately tell her she needs to stop. I don‚Äôt want nudes. I never asked for them and to please not do anything inappropriate. I told her I‚Äôve deleted the pics and again, please don‚Äôt send me anything like that. 

Now I know I should have blocked her immediately when she said she was 17. But her pleading and saying she‚Äôs alone etc resonated with me. I‚Äôm still an idiot. Should have blocked her. 

Am I in trouble because she sent me nudes? I never reciprocated or even asked for them. But I‚Äôm an adult. And would this count as child pornography?! 

What do I do? Do I need to do anything? I haven‚Äôt deleted the texts because 1. I want proof I didn‚Äôt ask for anything 2. I have pics of her dating profile. ",1,1731230321.0,legaladvice,6,0.6,False

When I got home, he mentioned that I‚Äôd accidentally left the kitchen light on, which kept him awake because it shines into the bedroom. He said it was too bright to sleep in and would‚Äôve fully woken up if he had to get up to turn it off. I apologized for leaving it on.

When he finally got up around 2 p.m., he seemed in a grumpy mood. I offered to make him a latte to help lift his spirits, but there was some confusion. I asked if it was okay to use the Nespresso machine, but he thought I meant the espresso machine and was unhappy when he saw I‚Äôd used the wrong one. I told him he could use the espresso machine if he preferred, and I‚Äôd drink what I made, but then he complained about not having enough milk left for his latte.

He later went on to say that leaving the light on this morning had ‚Äúderailed his day‚Äù and that my actions with the coffee hadn‚Äôt helped. He was unhappy that I worded my question to use the Nespresso machine badly and that I should‚Äôve picked a word that doesnt sound so much like espresso machine, such as saying if I can use the pods. I pushed back, saying I was sorry for the light but didn‚Äôt think it was fair to be blamed for his whole day going poorly and I specifically asked to use the nespresso because I know he typically doesn‚Äôt use that but I don‚Äôt know how to operate his espresso machine confidently.

1gnwtft,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1gnwtft/of_feelings_and_boundaries/,Of Feelings and Boundaries ,"I always dread confronting moments of vulnerability and emotional outbursts‚Äîespecially when it comes to him. But here I am, switched to laptop just for me to narrate how I feel. Anyways, it‚Äôs my first time doing this hehe. I am 28m, he‚Äôs 33. 

April of this year, I downloaded g app for a quick release‚Äîthe closer, the better. There was a profile next to my thumbnail that seemed like an obvious choice. I chatted with him, and we exchanged the usual queries. Surprisingly, we live in the same condo building, just two floors apart. He came to my place, and just like that, he managed to secure the top spot in my personal THE ranking‚Äîlol. I knew from that moment it wouldn‚Äôt be the last time, and I was right. Imagine a spoonful of sugar diluted in a heaping cup of coffee‚Äîthat‚Äôs how many times we did it; you simply lose count of the bits and pieces until they fade into the background. But amidst those moments, there was a smoke that ignited into an unyielding fire in me whenever we were together‚Äîand little did I know that I would be this COOKED for him.

Nope, my feelings weren‚Äôt purely sex-induced, it developed organically as I would love it to be. The hours-long conversations we had after each of our mutual releases, the values he holds, our shared disdain for ramen nagi (i‚Äôm sorry, gaes), the music we loved to listen to while sharing delivered meals, those random messages like ""Nagluto ako, akyat ka na, nakabukas ang pinto"" and ""May bawang ka ba? Haha."",  that night when you tried fighting your drunk sleepy eyes while I drive after our highball at Ginza Gyu, those random road trips, and my favorite memory: the cutest night we had together when we found out that we share the frustration over the inconsistent lyrics of ""D' Sound"" tattooed in my mind! To your frustration, you even messaged them for an explanation! And the answer they gave only frustrated you even more! Haha, what a brat! Really, I never imagined that I would meet someone that share my rumbled emotions over the most mundane things. In that moment, while we passionately shared our litanies while my eyes were locked on yours, I knew my feelings were real. It was simply a joyous epiphany‚Äîa Christmas and New Year celebration within my being‚Ä¶ 

But I walked away. 

I walked away for I know that every time he cooks, there‚Äôs always a separate lock n lock ready to be delivered. That every time we‚Äôre together, there's always a message he can‚Äôt resist to reply to. That every Chinese restaurant we‚Äôve been to, he doesn‚Äôt fail to mention that someone else would love the food we ordered‚Ä¶ I walked away because I realized that everything that was fun between us was just me. I walked away because I‚Äôm afraid of what I feel about him despite everything‚Ä¶I know he made it clear from the very start that ours is just casual‚Ä¶I know what he meant when you say ‚Äúumayos ka‚Äù I just chose to construe it in different ways other than what he actually meant‚Ä¶e sumandal ka e, mas bumigat, mas lumalim tuloy ang nilagapakan ko. 

But don‚Äôt get me wrong. I walked away but I don‚Äôt regret any single decision I made and all the things I did. I don‚Äôt regret the time  when I cut short my stay in Dagupan for 2 days with family instead of a weeklong vacation after you told me that you‚Äôre sick. Sped for like 160 km/h to reach BGC in no time wearing my pajamas. I don‚Äôt regret the time when I skipped the last opportunity to see my best friend before she leaves to migrate just to binge-watch Shogun with you. I don‚Äôt regret those plans I purposefully cancelled just in case. 

It‚Äôs been a month now since I decided to end things. And aside from the feelings I try to evade, I keep Japanese food out of my options because, although, it won‚Äôt taste like him,  I know I‚Äôll see him in every grain of Japanese rice and find him in the crisp of tempura. Sekitori will never be the same for me.

Pray for me, please. I need to find the courage and strength to lift my feet away from him esp when the time comes that we share the lift together lol‚ÄîI may or may not hug him by that time, JK. Sobs.

I woke up for work on the Tuesday and had my morning coffee and croissant, about 2 hours after the pain started again and I had to use the toilet. The bm* was normal, but I still had this pain. I went again to the toilet about 5 times that day and each time the bm* was normal but I had cramps constantly to go. Wednesday came around and I felt better, slightly n* but no bms*, Thursday and Friday I also felt better and no bms* but very decreased appetite on both days. 

Yesterday (Saturday) I ate breakfast and a coffee, then about 2 and a half hours later the need to go for a bm* and the pain started again. The cramps didn‚Äôt get better after I went  for a bm* and they carried on all day, I went to the toilet about 7 times in total and they were mostly just soft bm* not necessarily diarrrea. But the cramps and pain just will not go away, I‚Äôve woke up now on Sunday and the cramps are still here and I‚Äôve had to go to the toilet AGAIN. 

I have been very constipated for the past couple of months where I was not passing more than 2 stools a week and they were not very satisfying.

The meet-up point for my friends is Rajouri garden, once everyone is there, we take the ring road for a smooth and fast ride to Moolchand. Moolchand servers hot paranthas with chai and lassi.

After Paranthas, head over to Anand Ji chole bhature vaale for ""one"" of the best chole bhature you would ever eat. I personally don't recommend going to baba nagpal's store which is nearby moolchand because they don't accept UPI, even in 2024 and their prices have skyrocketed. 

After eating the delicious chole bhature, let's ride towards Hanuman mandir (CP). We go through India gate and various posh areas of Delhi and the ride quality is ‚ô•Ô∏è. Kachodi at Hanuman mandir and coffee at DePauls is the perfect way to end our ride.

I'm in my 7th day in the carnivore diet. I do it because I suffer from gut and digestion issues for many month now and my med thinks I have IBS. I tried a lot of things before finding out about this diet, so I put a lot of hope there!

. I have been eating steaks, ground beef, pork, duck,eggs, and some butter and cheese to increase my fat intake. Also some coffee that I'm trying to reduce.

The problem is i'm still struggling with gas, bloating, abdominal pains.... And i'm still burping, I still have farts etc. I'm also sleeping pretty bad cause of night's pains And I don't understand how can it still be here because I should not have any fermentation without glu? I know that I'm in the beginning of the way and it needs time but I would like to know if it's normal and if maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm wondering if I should do Lion Diet for some weeks to see if there is improvement ?

Yes it would be nice if I could wake up energised and ready to go earlier, but I didn‚Äôt so that‚Äôs that. But he called me around 6am and I felt more awake then than I did at 9am. Anyway. 

He watched his rugby game and said it was the best game he‚Äôs seen in yeaaaaars AND they won! I‚Äôm not sure why but it made me so happy. I suppose it‚Äôs not a mystery, I want him to have things that make him happy and entertained and I like that his countrys team might be making a bit of a comeback. He loves rugby so I want it to be as fun for him as possible. 

Okay I need to vent about a massively nothing thing but I‚Äôm annoyed nonetheless so here it is. 
I don‚Äôt really get why they couldn‚Äôt wait til I was finished in the kitchen. I‚Äôm purposefully not quiet about things like they could me me open as close my door and open the pantry and stuff. I was filling the jug to make a coffee and M‚Äôs guy comes in solo with no shirt on in boxers to unwrap their McDonald‚Äôs breakfast or idk some fast food whatever and put in the microwave like a) put some f‚Äôing clothes on this isn‚Äôt your house and b) can you not wait til I‚Äôm done? Like it‚Äôs midday you‚Äôve had all morning and didn‚Äôt just get back with food. Why does someone have to come out RIGHT as I‚Äôm going in to make something. So I put the jug on and made friendly conversation during that then left because I didn‚Äôt want to make small talk and I didn‚Äôt really want to be near someone in their underwear either. I‚Äôll just do my bagel when he‚Äôs done. But it‚Äôs like, seconds within me getting to the kitchen he came in. JUST F‚ÄôING WAIT TIL IM DONE FFS. Why are people like this. They were in her room too and I know they would have heard me go to the kitchen. Like if she‚Äôs happy with this guy then great, that doesn‚Äôt mean I want to get to know this child boyfriend of hers? Not boyfriend as he f‚Äôs her around and not child he‚Äôs 21 or 22 or whatever but same thing let‚Äôs be honest. I cannot fathom wanting anything to do with a guy that age? And he isn‚Äôt mature for his age. He has a daughter but acts like a child. I realise how much of a raging bitch I sound and I know an issue of mine is learning to share space ie this is her house too and if it were Andy going into the kitchen I would expect her to be friendly and polite and so I am too. But also if he knew someone else was home he would put a shirt on, y‚Äôknow. I don‚Äôt care if this dude is shirtless around the house when I‚Äôm not there but if I am, this is MY home so get dressed. I know Andy will. But maybe a level of decency is the difference between a boy and a man? Because lord knows only one of us is involved with a *man*. Okay I shall stop this tirade of judginess and go make a bagel. 

My bagel was delightful. I switched out the coffee for a hot chocolate too which upped the delight points. Only by a hair though considering it‚Äôs one of those 56 calorie sachet hot chocolates. So it‚Äôs really just brown water with less bitterness‚Ä¶ mmmmmmmmm. Either way I‚Äôm sat by the window on a rainy cold day with a ‚Äúhot chocolate‚Äù and cracking into a fresh new book so I‚Äôm content. 

I did a lil workout before. I wanted to go for a walk but it‚Äôs so rainy and puddles everywhere as I guess it also rained lots overnight and the last time I went for a walk in the rain in my sneakers they were wet for days. No thanks. I need some new, properly good walking shoes. Especially with summer coming up and I‚Äôll spend lots of it at mum and dads and therefore pups which means lots of country walks! Plus the ones I have now are old and hurt my feet sometimes. BF sales, perhaps. Anyway I did a Pilates session in my room and now I ache a bit so that‚Äôs good, I guess. 

Books can be so good at making you feel things. I feel like that was perhaps the understatement of the century, or at the very least in the running to be, but they just *do*. I‚Äôm reading a book now and she is wondering if her ex is dating someone new and it hurts and it makes me hurt, like I get that heart ache feeling on her behalf. They make me angry. They make me deliriously elated. They make me kick my feet around and get lovey butterflies. They give me butterflies filled with nerves and dread and fear. And then feelings of repulsion or frustration or secondhand embarrassment that makes me want to curl up into a ball and die as if I were the character in question. They can make me laugh and cry and smile and frown to the point I should consider Botox.  Sometimes I‚Äôll read one and while a lot has happened in it I felt somewhat blas√© the whole time, and sometimes one sentence will make me bawl my eyes out with no warning. I just think writers deserve more credit than they get, I‚Äôm sure they get a lot but they should get more. To think my honey might be one? Insane. He gives me all the butterflies and elation and fears and frowns and smiles regardless though. I think because I spent so long feeling so deeply deeply unhappy and much of it feeling entirely numb I don‚Äôt really take for granted how things make me feel. At least not yet. Like when I laugh out loud at a show or a book or something Andy or whoever else says, a lot of the time I‚Äôll look back on it a bit later and feel happy. Even when I feel miserable and that desperate saddened feeling I still feel happy to have it. Sometimes I wish I could go back to feeling nothing at all but that was worse. At least I‚Äôm somewhat living when I feel things, y‚Äôknow? I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm living though. I feel like I‚Äôm a placeholder or something. I feel like I‚Äôm maybe the gap between two paragraphs, there was the before and there will be the next but I constantly feel like I‚Äôm hovering between them both. That doesn‚Äôt make sense. I guess it‚Äôs a long way of saying I feel lost. Very, *very* lost. This journal thing has derailed. I like reading stories :) 
 
I finished another book today! 

I am truly never going to never be enough, am I? Sometimes it just hits me in this wave of realisation. Or no. Let‚Äôs not think that way. I may not be enough for a lot of people but the right man will think I am. And if I‚Äôm not enough for them that can reflect on them, not me. Right? Right. I believe none of that. I cannot move past this belief and I must. A lot of the time I know I‚Äôm better, I think more kindly of myself etc etc but these waves of sudden terror that I will never be enough for someone fills me with so much fear and dread I end up nauseous. I need this mindset FIXED. I can‚Äôt stop crying now. This is a joke. I cannot be like this. Get a fucking grip. I‚Äôm going to do some of my exercises now. 

I feel upset this evening. From before, I also think I have book hangovers and I think they‚Äôre compounding. They‚Äôre so real. Sounds so stupid but it‚Äôs not. 

I miss him.

We were forced out on a mission for International Rescue, and Parker was so stressed he almost swerved off the road. But luckily, when Penelope contacted Jeff through her compact, he told us to have a mental health day. ""Head home, do what you like to do, and get yourself recharged,"" he told us.



So we went home, and that was exactly what we did: have a mental health day. While Parker put his feet up with a mug of coffee, Penelope and I had a little 'us time'. We did some painting together, and while Penelope made a pretty marvellous masterpiece, I did some messy hand painting, which came in useful at one point. Later, we both had a luxurious bath with lots of bubbles - for me, it was to wash off all the paint on my body, and we just relaxed and felt the water loosen our muscles. After we've dried, we settled in our pyjamas and had 'er ladyship's favourite cocoa - it was so warm and delicious that I couldn't help but ask for a second mugful, which made Penelope giggle. To see how warm we were, we put our feet together and wiggled our toes, which made us both giggle, like we were besties for life.



Finally, we both felt extremely tired, so we went upstairs to clean our teeth and snuggle under the covers. We were both safe and warm together in bed, dreaming of another day of fun - just us two, together.",1,1731228025.0,RelaxAndUnwind,0,1.0,False

1gnw77a,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1gnw77a/will_money_be_our_problem_in_the_future/,Will money be our problem in the future?,"Background: Me (21M) and my bf (23M) have been together for 9 months now and we are both a student ‚Äî me being in 3rd year and him still in 1st year (shiftee). Weekly baon ko is 500 and siya is 2000 per week. Private school siya that have 100k tuition per semester tapos ako na government school so scholar ako. So, dito palang kita niyo na mas well off talaga siya kesa sakin at sofer yaman nila (you‚Äôll know later bakit ko nasabi). LDR kami.

The Problem: Every dates namin ay half half kami ng bayad and that is fine with me kasi alam ko naman na student din siya at syempre common naman yung mga ganon. Pero ako lagi kasi nabyahe papunta sa kanila with my super ipon na ipon kasi hindi na ako nakain sa school kasi ayoko gumastos para may pang-date ako. We meet like once a month ganon. Kung matatabong niyo bakit di siya pumunta or bumyahe dito sakin ay kasi sabi niya sakin ang hassle bumyahe at ayaw niya gabihin kaya sa once a month na pagkikita namin ay mostly 5-6 hours lang kami tumatagal huhu since late siya magising lagi tas nabyahe ng patanghali. 

Madaming instances na parang nafefeel ko na madamot siya sa pera or like pag-gastos para saakin, ilista ko lahat yung mga times na na-feel ko yun:

‚Ä¢ Yung nasira charger ko sabi niya ibibili niya ako doon sa bazaar tapos nung nandon na kami, ako padin ang nagbayad and nahiya ako magsabi na akala ko ikaw magbibili sakin.
‚Ä¢ Yung Birthday niya ang binigay ko is couple necklace namin, crochet baclava, crochet purse (my work, gawa ko yung crochet), snacks, lego lamp, and 1 dozen of Krispy kreme na fave niya. While, nung birthday ko, pumunta kami sa the bench tapos siya namili ng damit para sakin pero doon sa mga mura lang at may gusto akong medyo pricy like 500+ pero ang pinili niya para sakin is yung tig 200 pesos. Tho okay lang naman sakin pero gets niyo yung different level namin knowing na mas madami siyang funds
‚Ä¢ Nung pinapapunta ko siya dito, ako pa nagbayad ng joyrid e(para less hassle daw) niya tho I know it is me na nagyaya so ako mag-ano talaga non pero yeah nilibre ko din siya sa coffee shop non with my ipon for 1 month ata

Ngayon, pano ko nasabi na sobrang yaman niya/nila ay kasi sabi gmail account niya. I have access sa gmail niya at alam naman niya yon tapos grabe yung mga inoorder niya sa shoppee at grab food umaabot siguro gastos niya pero month ng 30k. And it got me thinking like sobrang dami niya talagang funds at parang sofer tipid naman niya sakin whenever we go out and such. 

Idk if I should feel something or wag ko pakeelaman kasi pera niya naman yon pero syempre diba kung ikaw ba alam mong di na nga nakain jowa mo kasi ipon nang ipon para lang sa date tapos ikaw na luxurios binibili mo, shouldn‚Äôt you take over on expenses sometimes? Ganern

What I‚Äôve tried so far:Ako kasi mapagbigay ako at super effort talaga like yung willingness ko talaga para lang sa date namin ganon and hindi naman ako humihingi ng kapalit. But, knowing my situation syempre mafefeel ko na it would be nice if he would take over sa mga dates namin or sumn diba idk I just feel like tinitipid

What advice I need: Then, it came up to me na ako mauunang grumaduate at mag trabaho kesa sa kanya and naiisip ko na baka maging issue samin yung pera like pano yung set up namin non? Should I be worried that someday kapag live-in na kami, magiging problema ba namin to? Ano dapat kong gawin? Ako ba ang may maling pag iisip? ",2,1731227497.0,adviceph,7,1.0,False

However when we‚Äôre outside and someone walks away, he goes ballistic. Examples:

1) We walk to a bakery/coffee shop. Partner will go in to order for both of us. Puppy starts scream barking and lunging uncontrollably
2) we walk outside front door and while the partner holding the leash is locking the door, the other walks ahead around the corner (which is only 3 feet away). He starts screeching and pulling.
3) we‚Äôll walk downstairs to garage together and one partner will walk to their car to leave whole the other takes him through garage door to go potty outside. This scenario used to be worse where he would barely be able to focus on the walk, cry, and would keep trying to go back to garage. However, now he does look back every so often but is able to focus on the walk without tugging and crying. 
4) If we‚Äôre walking together and one partner goes more than 3 ft ahead of the partner with the puppy, he goes crazy and starts tugging and crying

1gnvy56,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPTV_Unvarnished/comments/1gnvy56/reeses_own_words_catch_her_in_lies_about_voting/,Reese's own words catch her in lies about voting as well as about her real-life friends,"In tonight's stream, Reese talked about Sterling probably never coming back to SPTV even just for a Game Night and mentioned that her son was part of a scandal that rocked the Boy Scouts. She told about meeting a fan in person yesterday and prepared her fans for even more streams about the Jesters. Reese also has been caught in two major lies, and that will be the main focus of this post. Reese insists that she's not a liar, so all of her fans need to know she's lied about voting and about her real-life friends. 

A lot of people in Reese's chat have been freaking out about the elections this week, and Reese has tried incredibly hard to avoid the subject and to convince her fans that she knows nothing about politics. She claimed that she doesn't vote, but a stream from last October proves that's a lie.   
  
At the 1:42:36 mark in Squeezing The Cans Sunday with Jeff on Oct. 1, 2023, a chatter asked Reese if she votes in elections. ‚ÄúAbsolutely, yeah. Definitely,‚Äù Reese said. ‚ÄúI started voting not at like 18. I started voting later than that.‚Äù She said she thinks the first time she voted was when John McCain was running against Barack Obama. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the first time I ever voted,"" she said, adding she thought that was Barack Obama‚Äôs first run for president because John McCain was running with Sarah Palin. Jeff said he couldn't remember. Reese was right. John McCain and Sarah Palin ran in 2008.

Thank you to ElectronicShowboater for finding that clip and alerting me to it. Plainjane578 also pointed out that Reese said Jeff often had the news playing, so there's no way Reese didn't know anything about politics or national and international events. Jeff is a former City Council member in the Kansas City area and even before he and Reese were married, he was a diehard Trump supporter. He and his previous wife went to Trump‚Äôs swearing-in ceremony for their anniversary in 2016, according to the Kansas City Star.   
  
Since she started her channel, Reese has often said how political Jeff's social media accounts are, so she had some familiarity with what he was posting. Reese might not have agreed with Jeff's political views, but she certainly wasn't ignorant about them. And even on election night, Reese jumped into Aaron's chat to say that from her experience, Scientologists are Republicans because they're taught that Democrats are out-exchange. Reese didn't mention this on her own channel, of course. She doesn't want fans to ask if she's a Republican and get mad at her. She doesn't want them to ask who she voted for. 

Reese said she didn't vote this year, and some people in her Facebook group were upset with her about that. It's unknown whether Reese actually broke her habit and didn't vote in this year's elections. But it's clear that Reese would rather play dumb and say that she's not ready to vote instead of admitting that she knows a little about politics and that she's been a regular voter for quite a while. This whole act is incredibly insulting to her fans, and all of her chatters who were scared and upset over the elections this week need to understand that Reese lied to them just because she thought she could get away with it.

As Reese is doing roll call, one of her channel members asks when she‚Äôs going to be sponsored by Sephora. Reese doesn‚Äôt say that she‚Äôs already getting some commissions from Sephora products and simply answers ‚ÄúIt pisses me right off. I‚Äôd probably be a damn millionaire with all the frickin‚Äô lip stains I‚Äôve sold,"" she says.  
  
Reese says she used to get bronchitis every November, but then she got some Dianetics auditing and that stopped the issue. ""I'm serious,"" she says.   
  
When a chatter asks someone else if they pooped, Reese says they should want to know if she's pooped, because she's still constipated. She told Natalie last night that she hadn't pooped in days. A chatter asks Reese if she's drinking more water and Reese says not really. A superchatter tells her she needs prunes or Metamucil and Reese says she's not ready to take remedies that she thinks are just for old people. She says she's taking fiber gummies and if that doesn't do the trick, the poop is just not meant to come out. This is just another instance of Reese liking having something to complain about so she can get superchats with advice that she's unlikely to take.   
  
A chatter asks where a longtime fan of Reese's is. Reese says she hasn't seen her for a while. That fan has been in Keilah's chat recently on the Mental Health Matters channel. Keilah used to mod for Reese and her channel hit 1,000 subscribers yesterday, which means Mental Health Matters is monetized now. That's a real accomplishment that most YouTube channels don't reach.   
  
Reese says she just found out that her father's deceased wife Cathy used to work for OSA. Two of Cathy's daughters are OTVIIIs who live close to Reese in Tennessee.   
  
Reese gets a message from one of her mods and she asks if it's an emergency. Her mod says yes and Reese starts asking for more information.

Reese wants to send someone named Mary a superchat because her channel just got monetized. She's interrupting her stream to try to figure out how to get this done while Mary is live. She's preoccupied with this for several minutes.   
  
When a chatter asks Reese if she's the only one who wants Reese and Tommy to get back together, Reese says she thinks that might be true, adding that it's 50-50 that some fans want to see Reese move on and others want Tommy for themselves. She says that she and Tommy are still talking and they will be doing some streams together. There's no hurry for them to decide the future of their relationship, Reese says.   
  
Reese starts talking about expectations again and she says she worries that they're so subjective. Then her mod messages her that Mary is live so Reese takes another break to send a superchat and seems really stressed out when she can't figure out how to add words to her message or stop them from being broken into parts.   
  
Reese says again that people need to zoom out when they have expectations and look at the bigger picture. She credits a close friend's therapist for coming up with that advice.   
  
Reese says she never had friends until she started her YouTube channel and she adds that she's not trying to sound sad by saying that. But that's not true because Reese has introduced her audience to at least four real-life longtime non-Scientologist friends since starting her channel. She's had Michelle and Ryan on her channel. She's pointed out Mara in the chat.

During Reese's stream for H's birthday last year, a chatter named Carrie Schulz said ""Happy birthday, H! You are a gem!!"" Reese told H ""That's my real friend, Carrie."" She then catches herself and tells the fans that she just knows her in person. ""You guys are all my friends,"" she said. But she told H that she worked with Carrie before she had H. So she's known Carrie for at least 14 years.   
  
Reese keeps trying to lie to her audience and make them think that she and H are alone in the world without her YouTube fans, and that's insulting to Reese's real-life friends as well as her mom, stepdad and sister. This list of four real-life friends isn't even counting the shop owners and others who have come into Reese's chat saying they know her in real life. When one shop owner came into Reese's chat for the first time, Reese told her that they should go out for lunch like they used to.   
  
This whole ""my YouTube channel is my only source for friends and support"" schtick is a scam that Reese is using to pull in money, attention and sympathy for herself. Reese has had non-Scientologist friends for years. If Reese is to be believed, her friend Michelle is the one who finally got her to watch Scientology and the Aftermath. For months, Reese told fans her mom and sister kept trying to get her to watch that series. Then all of a sudden, she said Michelle convinced her to do it.

Reese says she had more enemies than she realized when she was in Scientology. She gives the example that she couldn't tell someone that she had a headache or she'd get written up for that. Reese doesn't have many expectations for people, she claims. She says when somebody lets her down or leaves her forever, she just tells herself that it can't be worse than what her dad did. ""I don't care. ... For 10 or 15 minutes I'm inconsolable, but then I'm used to that,"" she says.   
  
Reese says then there are people who have super tight expectations that they're not willing to budge on. She brings up Meryl Streep's character in Doubt as an example. She says she had to come across a certain way in Scientology ""and things are different out here in the real world."" But for years, Reese was only a public Scientologist who admits she rarely went on course. She was married to non-Scientologists and she managed not to recruit Fred, Jeff or any of her real-life friends into the cult. She had jobs and owned a home and a car, so she has lived more in the real world than many people who grew up in Scientology.   
  
Reese met another one of her channel members in person yesterday, and that fan says ‚ÄúWe can choose to react differently. No one has the power to make you do anything. We choose to.‚Äù That fan made Reese an afghan, and Reese shows a photo of her dog Gertie wrapped up in it. Reese says when we get upset about something someone has said or done, that is a choice that we are making. She acknowledges she used to hate it when she felt really angry and her ex-husband would tell her that was her choice.

Reese agrees with a chatter who says it has become a pattern to think that everyone will eventually tell her she's too much. ""We react because we are hurt,"" one of Reese's closest friends says. Reese says she realizes people can jump on someone's feelings until they feel like they have no choice, but they still do. Reese brings up the meltdown she had over her ex-mods leaving her channel and blocking her. ""I'll say again. I apologize to those people because I feel I didn't take any accountability there. ... I didn't need to go low.""   
  
One of Reese's friends says he feels like Scientology took empathy away from Reese, so when she gets upset, she doesn't see things from the other person's perspective until after things blow up. Reese says she's trying to do better at that.

Reese says people should be able to have expectations of each other, but when your expectations are not met, it's on you how to react. ""There's no reason to get upset, I think, or angry,"" Reese says. Of course she's saying that so that she can throw it in fans' faces when more of them become disillusioned with her and see that she's a manipulative liar. Reese's rule is that if someone isn't harming a person or an animal, anything goes.   
  
Reese says people's expectations change over time and they're not set in stone. ""You have wiggle room,"" she says. Reese says her therapist told her she needed to be more flexible about her expectations and not have to know how everything is going to turn out. ""You will be a much happier person if you are able to adjust them,"" she says he told her. A chatter says she read once that anytime we get angry, it‚Äôs because we put an expectation on someone they never agreed to. Reese thinks that point is genius.   
  
Reese says she put expectations on Tommy and that wasn't fair, adding that she loves Tommy and if she decides to get back with him, she might have to get in line because there are already so many women who want to be with him right now. Reese says she likes to stream with other people, but her favorite thing is to stream alone so she can interact with her chat. She says a lot of people have told her that she seems visibly uncomfortable when she streams with someone else, and that's because she knows she's too much for a lot of other people's fans. She doesn't want to push Aaron's boundaries too hard or make Natalie uncomfortable, she says.

When a fan asks if she'll do Game Night with Aaron again, Reese says she'd love to. Reese doesn't mention that Aaron has made it clear that his plan is to use Game Nights as SPTV Foundation fundraisers, and since the foundation doesn't have tax-exempt status yet, it may be a long time before SPTV sees another Game Night.   
  
Another chatter asks if Sterling would ever consider coming back for a Game Night or a stream with Reese. Reese says she wishes that he would and she misses him so much. ""But honestly, guys, I think he's happier being off of all social media. And that's all I'll say because I don't know any more about it. I just get the impression Sterling's done with us. He doesn't like drama, and I respect the hell out of that.""   
  
Reese reiterates that she's going to do more streams about the Jesters and her theory that the Jesters are behind a lot of the hatred for her on Reddit. She says maybe she's too naive to understand how dangerous it might be to keep exposing what she says is a sex cult, but she's not afraid to do it. She says Scientology was a warm, welcoming space next to the Jesters for her. She talks about how terrible the Diddy situation is and how the Jesters stuff relates to that. It sounds like she and Tommy are going to be making a major push for subscribers by trying to ride the wave of how popular Diddy coverage is. She calls the Jesters ""a low-budget Diddy situation.""   
  
She says talking more about the Jesters could fuck her over pretty bad, but she claims she has a lot of evidence that she hasn't shared yet and she'd like to do that on a bigger channel.

A chatter tells Reese that Andrew Gold wouldn‚Äôt do a show with him about the Boy Scouts scandal. He says he was a victim in that, and Reese responds that her child was too and that she‚Äôs so sorry. The major scandal that rocked the Boy Scouts involved a heartbreaking form of abuse.It is unconscionable for Reese to just throw out on livestreams casual mentions about abuses that H has suffered. That is way too personal for Reese to tell. She intentionally popped up two comments about the Boy Scouts and read them. She really crossed a line tonight.

Reese claims that Jeff won't even be a part of her Jesters streams anymore because he's no longer part of the group. But you said that he was involved in sex-trafficking, Reese. You said almost all of the evidence you had came from Jeff's computer. If Jeff is actually that evil, you have a duty to expose him too.   
  
Reese says she wants to write a book, but she's felt before that she isn't smart enough to do it. She says she's starting to change her opinion on that. ""People have offered to help me,"" she says.   
  
The fan she had coffee with yesterday didn't just bring Reese a homemade afghan. She went to Whole Foods and bought Reese's favorite truffle cheese. Reese says since she's been able to poop a little bit, she's going to end the stream and reward herself with some of that cheese.",8,1731226389.0,SPTV_Unvarnished,1,0.91,False

Lost soul,  a 31-year-old (human, last I checked) with a tendency to think too much and write too little. A philosophy major by training, I am well-versed in the labyrinthine thoughts of dead thinkers and occasionally capable of applying their work to the minutiae of daily life, much to the befuddlement of those around me. I dabble as a ghostwriter‚Äîa rather elusive occupation, I admit. If you ever read a novel and thought, ""This sounds like a book written by someone else,"" it may well have been me, lurking in the shadows of the credits.

Currently, I'm looking to connect with fellow curious minds, wordsmiths, or anyone who is willing to entertain deep discussions over coffee (or whatever you drink while contemplating the futility of existence). I think annyone who has been alive is a somewhat of a philosopher, and has their own or borrowed little philosophies from all around.  So I am more than happy to exchange thoughts, ideas, and, ideally, the occasional and ever welcome witty remark.

What is the meaning of life? Why are we here? Why does it take five attempts to properly write an email when you‚Äôre pretending to be someone else for a living? These are the sorts of questions I spend my time with, though I do occasionally break for the mundane tasks of surviving in this peculiar world.

So, if you too enjoy wandering through the weeds of thought, or perhaps just want a good chat about anything from existentialism to whether or not Discworld would make an excellent basis for modern philosophy (it would), let‚Äôs connect.

Looking forward to our intellectual misadventures.

1gnvx6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gnvx6l/best_friends_thc_cart_addiction_has_been_driving/,Best friend‚Äôs THC cart addiction has been driving me insane,"my best friend 18F and me 18F have been friends for about five years now. we're in our sixth form <early college program is the best way i could describe it for anyone outside of the UK> and she is actually driving me insane. she has very bad anxiety and became addicted to using the carts to cope, however, she is still living with her parents who found her items and grounded her for months. her parents blamed me ‚Äπunfounded>, and it got to a point where i nearly wasn't allowed to see her anymore. i begged her to quit smoking even though i still do because my friend does not have control over her emotions and is generally severely addicted, not to mention the impacts on our friendship due to her parents' perception of me and me as an individual as I don't exactly have the greatest home life and it caused them to view me in a different light which sort of took that escape away from me. she can't function without those 
pens. whenever they get taken away from her she cries for DAYS and tells everybody she's suicidal, despite being noticeably healthier the day prior. the second she gets a new one she goes back to being fine. it's gotten so bad to the point her mom has considered sending her to a rehab facility. my concern is, i feel shes being manipulative. she does have mental health issues but they present MUCH lighter when she has her THC carts and the second she doesn't have them she tells everybody she's suicidal, specifically me, to get me to buy them for her despite me begging her to quit because of the situation with her parents and the fact i want her to actually manage her mental health. she sees a psychiatrist, takes medication, and goes to therapy: but she tells me none of those things matter and refuses to even do basic self care routines, eat better, or develop hobbies because none of it will matter to her if she doesnt have her THC carts. she got caught with the last one she had on my birthday and I haven't bought her any carts, so shes been deprived of them for a couple months. she has become completely unrecognizable. she used to be the happiest, most upbeat person i know. but lately she has been so nasty and mean spirited, being EXTREMELY negative even in situations that dont involve her, inviting me over to her house and then being silent the entire time and glaring at me every time i try to say something. i tried to talk to her about how it was making me feel and saw her in the school bathrooms a few moments later and she texted me saying ""i went into the bathroom to cry but it's okay
'... like what? she repeatedly texts me about how she wants to unalive herself over small inconveniences and it upsets me because her parents have done everything in their power to get her
help, i have major depression as well as a few other mental disorders so i understand what it is like to manage and i consistently give her advice. and she just refuses to take any of it because she thinks nothing will be as good as the weed. its particularly upsetting to me because my last best friend did actually commit in 2022 and she knows about that and how sensitive of a topic it is for me, but i feel she tells me these things without wanting to hear me out and honestly i feel like its just her trying to get everyone to cave and for me to buy her stuff because i have a job and she doesn't. i'm so tired of it. she's started judging me based on whose parents have the most money, doing things like comparing the prices of our coffee makers, calling my neighborhood 'ghetto', etc. im so tired of it and im actually ready to end our friendship over it. she wants to go to uni in america and her parents are offering to pay the entire thing but she's irritated with them because her parents want to visit regularly and if they go into her dorm and smell drugs they've told her they won't pay for it. which i honestly think is understandable, shes told me repeatedly that she wants to ignore her grades in college and ""drink and smoke until she fucking dies."" im so frustrated with her. ive done
everything to try and help her but she won't listen to me and its heartbreaking watching her go through this but I'm just so, so tired of it. it's taking the biggest toll on me mentally. ive had multiple conversations with her where she's told me she knows she's being selfish but she just doesn't care. i'm generally ready to just end our friendship, but it would be so awful for me because i love her so much and i just want to see her get better. but it doesn't look like that's going to be happening, so I don't know what to do. its especially annoying because she's specifically addicted to the cartridges which have been shown to have a much more negative impact on health rather than just smoking flower, and she goes through a 2g (equivalent to a 2000 mg edible) cart in about a week. shes noticeably less.. bright as well, subjects that used to be so easy for her have become hard. i dont know whether to distance myself from her or what",1,1731226268.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
