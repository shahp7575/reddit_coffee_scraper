1pn2744,https://www.reddit.com/r/daygame/comments/1pn2744/fr_the_silent_girl_lay_how_to_handle_an_introvert/,"[FR] The ""Silent Girl"" Lay: How to handle an introvert girl in India when she barely speaks (Logistics Breakdown)","TL;DR: approached a super shy/introverted girl. She barely spoke a word. Most guys would panic and try to ""talk her into liking them."" I didn't. I used a system based on body language (Kino) and logistics.

Result: 2-minute instant date to Hotel lay.

We all know Indian girls can be very guarded or shy initially. If you rely on ""verbal game"" (banter/jokes), you will fail with these girls. You need to look at their actions, not their words.

Here is the exact breakdown of how I handled it.

I approached. She locked eyes but stayed completely silent. A rookie mistake here is to start blabbering to fill the silence. That makes you look needy. Instead, I ran a ""Physical Test"" (Kino):
- I held her hand. She didn't pull back.
- I touched her hair. She let me.

Her mouth said nothing, but her body said ""YES."" Because her physical compliance was high, I didn't wait. I said, ""Let's grab coffee right there,"" and bounced her instantly.

We went to Starbucks. I immediately gave her a job: ""Do me a favor. Go find us a good seat upstairs while I order."" She went and did it. Why this matters: In her mind, she is now following my lead.

We sat down. She was still quiet. I didn't panic. I just ran comfortable silence and light touch. I seeded the next location immediately: ""After this, we're going to grab a quick beer.""

We left Starbucks and bought a beer. Crucial Move: I asked her to put the beer bottle in her bag. This is a psychological trick. She is now carrying the logistics for our date. She is invested.

Now, the hardest part in India: The Hotel Seed. If you ask: ""Want to go to a hotel?"" -> She will say NO (She feels cheap/slutty). What I did: I told a story.

""Last time I was here, my friends and I found this cool, safe spot near Garden Galleria to chill... We're going there to drink this beer, then I gotta run."" I framed the hotel as a ""cool place to chill,"" not a place to sleep together.

We got to the hotel. She hesitated at the door. Her: ""This place looks shady."" Most guys get defensive here (""No it's not!"") or beg (""Please come in""). My Response: I stayed 100% calm. I didn't argue.

I just said, ""It's fine. We're not doing anything weird, let's just chill for 10 mins."" I held her hand and walked in. She followed. Inside, I didn't rush.

I made her play DJ (put on her music). I turned off the harsh lights. I focused on comfort. Because I led correctly from the start, things happened naturally, clothes out, dick out and we had our best time.

1. Silence is not Rejection: If she stays with you and lets you touch her, she likes you. Shut up and lead.

2. Seed Early: I mentioned the beer while we were at coffee. I mentioned the ""chill spot"" while we were buying beer.

3. The ""Indian Hotel"" Paradox: Never ask a girl to go to a hotel for sex. Lead her there for an ""adventure"" or ""chill session.""

4. Don't Argue: When she says ""It's shady"" or ""I can't,"" don't fight her with logic. Just lead her with confidence.

This wasn't luck. It was a system. Most of you are losing girls because you are ""guessing"" what to do next instead of having a roadmap.

I’m really hoping for your help.

My wife and I have been together for **25 years**, and for a very long time we’ve been searching for a movie that has a deep romantic meaning for us.

We believe it’s a **romantic movie (probably from the 2000s)**. There is a scene where a man does something very specific and unusual:  
He **puts the bottle caps from his beer bottles into a drawer instead of throwing them away** (possibly a drawer under a coffee table or living room furniture).

Why this matters so much to us:  
In the **very early days of our relationship**, I used to do *exactly* the same thing – I always put my beer bottle caps into a drawer under the living room table. My wife thought it was **totally weird**, and it became one of those small, funny things you remember forever.

Years later, when we watched this movie, we both had the same reaction:  
*“That’s you!”*

Sadly, over time we forgot the title of the movie.  
I’m not just looking out of curiosity – I would love to **give this movie to my wife as a Christmas present**, as a symbol of our shared history.

Even **partial memories, similar scenes, or wild guesses** are very welcome.  
Thank you so much for reading and helping ❤️",1,1765786427.0,moviefinder,0,1.0,False

I’m a British expat temporarily relocating to Manila soon for work. I’ll be heading the Asia Pacific operations for a multinational company. Exciting, slightly overwhelming, and definitely a big life change. I'm planning to be here for the next 6 months and then move back to the UK, hopefully with a companion.

I’m 45, 5’7”, sporting a proud dad-bod, and very much single. While I’m thrilled to experience life in the Philippines, I’d also love to meet someone friendly who can help me ease into the culture, the city, and the everyday rhythm of life here.

1pn25f1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pn25f1,Jillian’s job deserves its own timeline,"Grab a coffee, this gonna be long. I’ve been sitting on this for a bit, but the timeline is too clean to ignore.

I’m just going to say the quiet part out loud:

I don’t think Jillian found that collectibles job. I think Vinnie helped her get it.

First, the timing is the loudest part.

She starts appearing in that “store”’s TikToks and live auctions the exact date the relationship starts (according to Vinnie in his hard launch stream - 18th of August). Not weeks later. Not “I’ve been here a while.” That alone screams arranged proximity, not organic hiring.

Second, her behavior on the lives does not match someone whose job is to sell. She pulls viewers but doesn’t convert. She talks about herself, her vibe, her life. She breadcrumbs her boyfriend nonstop instead of focusing on product.

That’s influencer behavior, not sales behavior. Any company that does live auctions cares about conversion, not vibes.

Third, the breadcrumbing wasn’t subtle, and that matters. She didn’t just quietly have a boyfriend. She wore his clothes, referenced his cats by name, dropped initials, let fans connect dots in real time.

That turns a shop livestream into a parasocial feeding ground, which is great for her visibility and terrible for brand safety. And surprise, surprise: stans and snarkers flood in, chaos follows, and then comes the doxxing.

Fourth, the company reaction tells you everything.

After the doxxing and the oversharing she’s quietly removed from live streams, she’s reassigned to prerecorded content, she reframes it publicly as “my choice.”

That is textbook corporate damage control. If it were truly her decision, there would be no need to sanitize the format.

If Jillian were just some random LA girl hired to sell collectibles and she failed to convert sales, turned live auctions into parasocial chaos, overshared personal details, attracted stans + snarkers, and allowed a doxxing involving a very high-profile person…

The response would not be gentle reassignment.

It would be removal from the brand entirely.

Live-auction businesses are ruthless.

They care about conversion, brand safety, and control. Period.

Fifth, Vinnie’s involvement tracks perfectly.

He promotes her lives, sends his mods to help, joins briefly, then fully pulls back.

This looks less like enthusiasm and more like trying to stabilize a mess he helped create, then backing away once it became clear the oversharing was out of control.

Another giveaway of Vinnie’s involvement: If Jillian had gotten this job independently there would be no incentive to keep her around once she became a problem, no reason to tiptoe, no reason to restructure the role instead of ending it.

But if the job was facilitated through Vinnie’s network, even casually the company has motivation to soften the response, avoid drama, and quietly contain the situation. Especially given his relevance in anime / collectibles culture.

It absolutely feels like a favor placement.

Not in a villain way. In a very LA way. Very “I know people” way.

He’s deeply embedded in anime, gaming, collectibles culture. He knows people. Getting her a “safe,” adjacent job where she could build something would make sense. Especially early on, especially before the public knew.

But she didn’t treat it like a job. She treated it like a stage. And that’s why it collapsed.

So I really think the job was likely arranged or at least facilitated through his network. She used it primarily for clout and proximity instead of performance. The company tolerated it until it became a liability. V started setting boundaries once he realized how exposed he’d made himself. That’s exactly what this looks like.

The real throughline in all of this isn’t “evil mastermind” or “poor innocent girl.”

It’s a private person underestimating how much an oversharer will overshare, and an oversharer mistaking access for entitlement.

This doesn’t look like organic career growth.

It looks like access granted → access abused → boundaries enforced.",3,1765786339.0,jillianbrennasnark,0,1.0,False

1pn235m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernLuxuryKitchen/comments/1pn235m/how_to_personalize_your_kitchen_for_your_lifestyle/,How to Personalize Your Kitchen for Your Lifestyle,"Designing a kitchen today goes far beyond selecting cabinets, countertops, and appliances. It is about shaping a space that genuinely supports the way you live, move, cook, and connect with others. Modern kitchens often serve multiple roles at once: a place for preparing meals, a social hub for entertaining, a homework station, a remote workspace, and sometimes even a quiet corner for a morning coffee. Because of this, personalization is no longer a luxury—it is a necessity. A kitchen designed around your habits, routines, and preferences feels intuitive and comfortable, reducing friction in daily tasks. Instead of chasing short-lived trends, the most successful kitchens start with lifestyle-driven decisions and then layer in style elements that reflect personality and taste.

## Understanding Your Daily Kitchen Habits

The foundation of a personalized kitchen begins with an honest look at how you actually use the space on a daily basis. Do you enjoy cooking from scratch several nights a week, or does your kitchen mainly support quick breakfasts and simple dinners? Are weekends filled with hosting friends and family, or is the kitchen primarily a private, functional zone? These details shape critical design choices, from appliance selection to traffic flow. Passionate home cooks may prioritize expansive prep areas, ventilation, and professional-grade appliances, while busy households often need durable finishes, easy-clean surfaces, and efficient layouts. By observing your routines and pain points, you ensure the kitchen works with your lifestyle instead of forcing you to adapt to it.

## Using Inspiration Tools to Define Your Style

Once functionality is clear, inspiration tools become far more effective and meaningful. Browsing curated resources like [kitchen catalogs](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/catalogs) allows you to see fully realized kitchen concepts rather than disconnected ideas. Catalogs are particularly helpful because they present balanced designs that integrate layout, materials, lighting, and finishes in realistic proportions. As you explore different kitchens, patterns naturally begin to emerge. You might consistently gravitate toward clean-lined cabinetry, natural wood textures, or bold architectural islands. These repeated preferences help clarify your personal design language, making it easier to communicate your vision to designers and ensuring your final choices feel cohesive and intentional.

## Layout Choices That Match Your Lifestyle

Layout is one of the most influential factors in how a kitchen feels and functions. A personalized layout mirrors how you move, cook, and interact within the space. Open-plan kitchens are ideal for those who value connection and visibility, allowing cooking and socializing to happen simultaneously. More defined layouts, on the other hand, can benefit serious cooks who prefer focused work zones and minimal distractions. Island-centered kitchens often suit families and entertainers, offering seating, storage, and prep space in one central feature. Thoughtful placement of storage, appliances, and work areas ensures frequently used items are always within reach, creating a kitchen that feels natural rather than restrictive.

## Exploring Materials Through Real-Life Experience

While photos and inspiration boards are valuable, experiencing materials in person is essential before final decisions are made. Visiting [kitchen showrooms Westchester](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/kitchens) allows you to see finishes under real lighting conditions, open drawers, test hardware, and feel surfaces firsthand. This sensory experience reveals practical details that images cannot convey. For example, glossy finishes may look striking online but require frequent cleaning, while matte or textured surfaces often better suit active households. Showrooms also provide access to knowledgeable professionals who can help balance durability, maintenance, and aesthetics, ensuring material choices align with both your lifestyle and long-term expectations.

## Storage Solutions Built Around Real Needs

Storage is where personalization truly elevates everyday living. Kitchens designed around real usage patterns are far more efficient and enjoyable. Deep drawers for cookware, pull-out pantry systems, corner solutions, and hidden appliance garages reduce clutter and streamline tasks. If baking is a regular activity, a dedicated baking zone with organized ingredient storage can dramatically improve workflow. Families may benefit from snack drawers, homework stations, or integrated charging areas within cabinetry. Thoughtful storage planning minimizes frustration, keeps the kitchen organized, and turns routine activities into smoother, more satisfying experiences.

## Blending Personal Style With Long-Term Practicality

A well-personalized kitchen strikes a balance between self-expression and long-term practicality. While it is important to reflect your taste, it is equally important to think about how your needs may change over time. Timeless design foundations combined with personal accents often deliver the best results. Neutral cabinetry can serve as a versatile backdrop, while lighting, hardware, backsplashes, and accessories add personality and can be updated more easily. According to a Wikipedia overview of kitchen design, adaptable layouts and durable materials are consistently linked to higher long-term satisfaction. This approach ensures your kitchen remains functional, attractive, and relevant as lifestyles evolve.

## Creating a Kitchen That Feels Like Home

At its best, a personalized kitchen feels welcoming and effortless from the moment you step into it. It supports your daily routines, reflects your personality, and adapts naturally to the rhythm of your life. Achieving this requires thoughtful planning, realistic inspiration, and hands-on exploration of layouts and materials. By aligning function with personal style and anticipating future needs, the kitchen becomes more than just a functional room. It transforms into a space where efficiency, comfort, and enjoyment come together seamlessly, creating a kitchen that truly feels like home.

here is the situation. I (34F) have been with my husband (40M) for 7 years. He has a brother whose wife I don’t get along with at all. She never liked me from the beginning (which would be fine), but over the years she has constantly made snide remarks, been passive-aggressive, acted like a know-it-all, and my husband has always been very friendly with her for the sake of his relationship with his brother, whom he loves very much.

In several situations when my sister-in-law ignored me and refused to talk to me, my husband still maintained a great relationship with her. I decided to distance myself from my brother-in-law and his wife and simply stop having contact with them because they cause me stress and anxiety. I stopped attending events where they would be present.

I received “attacks” and accusations from my sister-in-law, and I honestly explained to my husband that I will not socialize with people in whose company I feel uncomfortable. My husband remained neutral in this situation.

We started therapy, and the therapist clearly emphasized to him that it is important for the two of us to be a team and for him to stand by me as his wife, especially since I am not forbidding him from having a relationship with his brother, but I want him to define his priorities and stand behind me.

My husband keeps saying that he will react differently in the future and set clearer boundaries, but I honestly don’t really believe him because I’ve been watching different behavior for seven years.

And now we come to the next situation. A few days ago, my husband and I went out for a drink, and at that moment his brother called him. My husband told him he couldn’t talk at the moment and that he would call him later. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t shake the feeling, and I checked my husband’s conversation with his brother and saw that he had written: *“Sorry, I’m out for a drink with a COLLEAGUE.”*

I know it’s not okay to go through someone’s phone, and I really don’t usually do that. But once again, I’m deeply disappointed because my husband does one thing, says another, and feels a third. Why on earth would he lie to his brother and say he’s having coffee with a colleague?

I feel deeply betrayed, and I’m not sure I want to stay in a marriage with such a coward. I’m afraid of divorce because we have a child, and I’m scared of going through that process. I need your opinions and experiences regarding this situation.",1,1765785770.0,rMarriage,0,1.0,False

I spend my days in healthcare, which is rewarding, but I always make time for fun, fitness and travel. My professional life revolves around helping others and it keeps me curious and fulfilled. I'm a bit of a Netflix enthusiast but also love reading or listening to podcasts. Im someone who can get equally excited about a spontaneous trip or a quiet night in. I enjoy meaningful conversations as much as silly banter and I take fitness seriously but chocolate is my weakness. Not into drinking or smoking, but always up for coffee, travel or dessert. Friends describe me as grounded, loyal, thoughtful, warm and kind. Family and meaningful connections are very important to me.



What I’m Looking For:

I’m looking for a partner who is serious about building a long term, committed relationship leading to marriage.

 Ideally, they would be:

\* Age: 30–35, Hindu, preferably OC and telugu speaking partner

\* Professionally settled, ambitious, with a growth mindset

\* Honest and trustworthy, valuing loyalty deeply

\* Emotionally mature, empathetic and comfortable with vulnerability

\* Communicative and willing to work through conflicts with patience

\* Family oriented, appreciating the importance of strong family bonds

\* Open to evolving together and growing as individuals and as a couple

\* Desired earnings: ₹30+ LPA

\* Living arrangement: Preferably live separately with partner after marriage

\* Lifestyle: I've ever smoked or drank, and while I'd love a partner with similar habits, Im okay if they enjoy a drink now and then but strictly no smoking and drugs pls

\* Wants kids and is ready for marriage

  


Not into casual stuff looking for a serious connection and happy to share more over DM, which can later transition to matrimonial platforms.

I (31M) have met my partner (33M) almost 10 years ago. At the time I was closeted and didn’t believe I would be a good boyfriend - I didn’t quite understand or feel comfortable with my sexuality enough to be in a relationship of any kind. He, on the other hand (though closeted to his immediate family) had been in relationships before and was comfortable pursuing one with me.

I initially turned down his advances, his invitations to hang out with his friends and things of the sort, knowing I wasn’t ready. He took the rejection hard, and later revealed he had planned to spend a gap year working abroad. I didn’t ask him to stay, knowing he could resent me for it someday, but I still decided to try and live the moments I had left with him.

I fell for him. Hard. To the point that mere days after his departure, I’d planned a trip to visit him around the halfway point of his stay. We spoke every day and I could feel myself falling harder as days went by. My trip was amazing, our time together was everything I had hoped… But he started detaching as soon as I landed back home.

I believed we were building something real across distance, and anchoring my life around the idea of “us”. Then a friend of his reached out to me, knowing I had been suffering over his absence, and told me the truth - he had extended his visa for another two years, and had been seeing other people the entire time.

Finding out through someone else wasn’t just betrayal — it destroyed the reality I had been living in. What hurt most was that he never gave me the dignity of the truth, and actively prevented me from moving on, by having jealousy fits from a distance, whilst he had moved on himself.

By that time though, I had already made plans to move. I’d loved Australia and was going through a tough time at work, so I decided to apply for Masters degree programs to take a break whilst giving my career a boost. We weren’t on speaking terms but he still reached out 6 months later, around the time of my departure.

We met for coffee and patched things up. I wasn’t looking for a boyfriend again but rather a friend/ally that could help me navigate life in a new country. As you can imagine, it didn’t take long for me to develop or reignite feelings for him.

However, even after I uprooted my life and moved, proximity didn’t mean presence and he remained distant and indifferent. I was physically closer than ever, yet emotionally invisible. This break taught me that availability does not equal care — and that constantly chasing someone slowly erodes your self-worth. At that moment I snapped out of it and never quite fully recovered, fearing he’d break my heart again if I fully surrendered.

I don’t know what happened, but he became all I had hoped for afterwards. He started putting me first, actually pursuing me and trying to make me change my mind. I gave him one last chance.

For years, it was good. We moved in together, he supported me after I lost my job during the pandemic, focusing on me staying in my relevant field which eventually led to achieving Permanent Residency through state sponsorship, and he takes good care of me.

Then, two years ago, he cheated on me.

The betrayal wasn’t just sexual; it invalidated years of compromise, forgiveness, and emotional labor. From that moment on, something in me shut down for good. I could no longer love him the way I once did, but still chose to forgive him and try to move on.

The betrayal still plays in my head though. Sometimes my mind randomly brings it up in a twisted self loathing kind of way that prevents me from actually being a good boyfriend. I’m emotionally numb, and I’m afraid my mind has friendzoned him for my protection.

When we spoke about our history and the current state of our relationship, he has reaffirmed his commitment and love for me, and I do believe him. However, two things keep playing on my mind since that latest conversation:

1.	⁠He has said he loves me and nobody has pursued him in the same way I have, which led me to the thought that when he started pursuing me again… that was him settling for me.
2.	⁠Not hating him does not necessarily mean this relationship can be fixed or that it needs fixing, maybe it has ran its course. We may be comfortable with the relationship as it is, but it doesn’t negate the fact that we could be happier.

What should I do?

The **Kailash Mansarovar Yatra** is not an ordinary journey. It takes you through one of the highest, coldest, and most remote regions in the world. While most pilgrims focus on fitness, permits, and trekking difficulty, many underestimate the importance of food, drinking water, and hygiene for a safe and successful Yatra.

At high altitude, your body reacts differently to food. Digestion slows down, dehydration occurs more quickly, and even minor hygiene issues can escalate into serious problems. Understanding what you will eat, how water is managed, and how to maintain cleanliness along the route can make the difference between a smooth pilgrimage and an uncomfortable one.

This guide explains everything you need to know about **food on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra**, **drinking water safety in Tibet**, and **hygiene on high altitude tours**, based on real travel conditions.

# 1. Understanding Food Conditions on the Kailash Mansarovar Route

The Kailash region lies in remote western Tibet. Due to altitude and climate, food options are limited and simple. Luxury meals are not possible, but **nutritious, warm, and hygienic food** is always the priority.

Most organized yatras provide meals prepared by trained kitchen teams who understand high-altitude needs.

# 2. What Kind of Food Is Served on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra?

# 2.1 Vegetarian Food Only

All meals on the Kailash Mansarovar route are **pure vegetarian**. This is done for two reasons:

* Religious and spiritual respect
* Easier digestion at high altitude

Non-vegetarian food is strongly discouraged because it is hard to digest and increases health risks.

# 2.2 Typical Meals During the Yatra

Here’s what pilgrims usually eat during the journey:

# Breakfast

* Porridge or oats
* Bread or chapati
* Butter or jam
* Boiled eggs (sometimes avoided at very high altitude)
* Tea or coffee

# Lunch

* Rice
* Dal (lentils)
* Vegetable curry
* Soup
* Pickles

Lunch is often packed or served hot, depending on the location.

# Dinner

* Rice or noodles
* Vegetable curry
* Dal or soup
* Simple dessert (occasionally)
* Herbal or ginger tea

Meals are designed to be:

* Light
* Warm
* Easy to digest
* Energy-giving

This balanced approach supports stamina during trekking days.

# 2.3 Tibetan Meals You May Encounter

In some Tibetan guesthouses or towns like Saga and Darchen, you may also see local food such as:

* Tsampa (roasted barley flour)
* Thukpa (Tibetan noodle soup)
* Tibetan bread
* Butter tea

These are safe if prepared hygienically, but should be eaten in moderation if your body is not used to them.

# 3. How Food Changes With Altitude

As altitude increases:

* Appetite reduces
* Digestion slows
* Spicy or oily food causes discomfort

That’s why food on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra becomes simpler as you move closer to Kailash.

# Recommended Eating Habits

* Eat small portions
* Eat slowly
* Avoid overeating
* Chew properly
* Eat warm food only

Your goal is nourishment, not satisfaction.

# 4. Drinking Water Safety on the Kailash Route

# 4.1 Why Drinking Water Needs Special Attention

At high altitude, dehydration happens quickly, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Cold weather suppresses thirst, but your body still loses fluids through breathing and walking.

Unsafe water can cause stomach infections, which are dangerous in remote areas.

# 4.2 Is Tap Water Safe in Tibet?

**No.**  
Tap water in Tibet is **not safe to drink**, even in hotels or guesthouses.

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--587ee34457a5---------------------------------------)

You should never:

* Drink tap water directly
* Brush teeth with tap water (unless boiled)
* Drink untreated lake or river water

# 4.3 Safe Drinking Water Options

# Boiled Water

Most reliable option. Provided by tour operators at meal times.

# Packaged Bottled Water

Available in towns like Saga and Darchen, but supply may be limited.

# Water Purification Methods

Highly recommended:

* Water purification tablets
* Portable water filters
* UV water purifiers

Many experienced pilgrims carry at least one purification method as backup.

# 4.4 How Much Water Should You Drink Daily?

At high altitude:

* Minimum **3–4 liters per day**
* Sip water regularly
* Don’t wait to feel thirsty

Warm water is better than cold water and helps digestion.

# 5. Hygiene on High Altitude Tours: What You Must Know

Maintaining hygiene in Tibet is challenging but extremely important. Cold weather, limited water, and basic facilities make cleanliness harder, but not impossible.

# 6. Toilet Facilities on the Kailash Route

# 6.1 Types of Toilets

* **Guesthouses:** Basic squat toilets
* **Trekking route:** Open toilets or portable tents
* **Remote areas:** Nature calls (with care and respect)

Toilets are basic, and cleanliness varies by location.

# 6.2 Toilet Hygiene Tips

* Carry your own toilet paper
* Use biodegradable wet wipes
* Carry hand sanitizer
* Always wash or sanitize your hands after use

Never expect Western-style toilets on the route.

# 7. Bathing and Personal Cleanliness

# 7.1 Is Bathing Possible During the Yatra?

Full bathing is limited due to:

* Cold temperatures
* Lack of hot water
* Risk of catching a cold

Pilgrims usually avoid bathing for several days.

# 7.2 Alternative Hygiene Practices

* Use wet wipes for body cleaning
* Wash face and hands with warm water
* Change inner clothing regularly
* Keep feet clean and dry

At high altitude, staying dry is more important than staying fully bathed.

# 8. Hand Hygiene: Your First Line of Protection

Many illnesses on the Kailash route come from poor hand hygiene.

Always:

* Wash your hands before eating
* Use sanitizer after touching common surfaces
* Avoid touching your face with dirty hands

Carry a small sanitizer bottle in your pocket at all times.

# 9. Food Safety Tips for Kailash Mansarovar Yatra

To stay healthy:

* Eat only freshly cooked food
* Avoid raw vegetables
* Avoid street food
* Avoid cold leftovers
* Avoid dairy unless trusted

If food smells unusual or feels undercooked, skip it.

# 10. Snacks to Carry for the Journey

Personal snacks are very helpful, especially during long drives and trekking days.

# Recommended Snacks

* Dry fruits (almonds, raisins, walnuts)
* Energy bars
* Biscuits
* Chocolates (dark chocolate is good)
* Glucose or electrolyte powder

Avoid snacks that melt, spoil easily, or cause acidity.

# 11. Hygiene During the Kailash Kora (Parikrama)

During the 3-day Kailash Kora:

* Facilities are very basic
* Water is limited
* Cold is intense

# Important Tips

* Carry wet wipes in a daypack
* Use lip balm and moisturizer
* Keep feet dry to avoid blisters
* Change socks daily
* Air shoes whenever possible

Good hygiene helps prevent fatigue and infection.

# 12. Common Health Issues Linked to Poor Hygiene

If hygiene is ignored, pilgrims may face:

* Stomach infection
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Dehydration
* Weakness

These issues are harder to treat at high altitude, so prevention is essential.

# 13. Cultural Respect and Cleanliness

The Kailash region is deeply sacred. Pilgrims should:

* Avoid polluting lakes and land
* Use toilets responsibly
* Carry waste back if needed
* Avoid plastic litter

Respecting nature is part of the spiritual journey.

# 14. Final Say

The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is as much about discipline as devotion. Paying attention to **food on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra**, **drinking water safety**, and **hygiene on high altitude tours** keeps your body strong and your mind calm. When your health is stable, you can focus fully on the spiritual power of Mount Kailash and Mansarovar Lake.

Good food, clean water, and simple hygiene habits may seem small, but they play a huge role in making your Yatra safe, meaningful, and memorable.

If you are planning the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and want a journey that is **well-organized, hygienic, and professionally managed**, travel with experts who understand high-altitude conditions.

Every single one needs to go into Google Sheets for client reports or to combine data from multiple sources. (I don't like using numbers/excel).



**The manual process:** 

\- File → Import → Upload → Browse → Configure → Wait - 2-3 minutes every time 

\- 10+ times per day 

\- My soul is slowly dying 

So I built CSVtoSheets - a Mac app that makes CSV files double-click to open in Google Sheets. One-time setup, then it just works. 



**The build:**

\- \~40 hours total (first time building Mac app) 

\- Google OAuth was surprisingly easy 

\- Hardest part: going through the review process to get the app signed by apple 

\- The project has been sitting on the shelf for like 3 months, but I finally forced myself to finalise it :D 

\- Launched 5 weeks ago 



**The results:**

\- 12 customers at $14 = \~$168

\- Posted on HN (no traction), r/macapps (decent), wrote three SEO post 

\- Getting 1-2 sales every 2 weeks from organic search and referrals. Slow, but totally fine!

\- Zero paid ads. It'll never be a startup. 

But it saves me time, covers my morning coffee budget, and feels good to ship something people actually use.

She lost her husband to suicide. It’s been almost 4 years and she still blames herself. We all thought she’d come back with time but I’m starting to kind of accept this is the new her. 

She used to be the life of the party. She was always laughing, joking, and had a lot of energy. Her husband was more calm and collected, settled her down a bit. He was very smart, he was cultured too. White boy but knew bachata and We are Hispanic, and those who know, we like to drink a bit, and alcoholism is common in our culture.

So to be honest she’s never been the same. She barely talks now. Doesn’t smile, and when she does it’s always forced. She stays at home, we beleive she’s been drinking very heavily. she had to start working again to pay the rent on the apartment. So she was telling me the other day about how she hates her job and I was like “what if we lived together, you could maybe work a little less and we would both save money” and she explained she’s not ready to leave her apartment. 

And here’s the thing, she said “I just wish I at least had a man here for me.”

So I said ya know maybe she can try to meet people and get back out there. And she looked at me like I was nuts and said I was “fucking disgusting” and she’s a “married woman” and I just said I only suggested it because of what she just said before and she’s like “I’m not a fucking cheater maybe youre a wh*re but not me” and kicked me out. And as I was getting up and leaving I saw tequila under her couch. I didn’t say anything to her but told my mom. Me, my mom, a couple cousins, and my dad tried to talk to her via an intervention and she wouldn’t listen to us and just left and went home.

She has shown up drunk to family events, including our little cousins 2nd birthday, my cousin has seen her sneak tequila in her coffee, she was “accused” of drinking at work, and what she’ll do now is drink a corona, because it’s “just a corona” but then sneak tequila in it so nobody knows how much she’s really been drinking.

And I rarely ever get silky milk. It always has little bubbles all over the top and throughout the milk. I’ve tried giving less air, but then it just ends up being really liquidy hot milk - like I might as well have just microwaved it.

So what I was taught from my boss: Angle the cup a little, starting with a tiny bit of the line of the tip peeking out of the milk, then pull down little by little until the pitcher is too hot to touch. Wait a few seconds - and turn off the machine.

What I was taught from the career barista: Angle the cup a little, starting with a tiny bit of the line of the tip peeking out of the milk, then pull down little by little until the pitcher is skin temperature, then push pitcher back up to fully submerge the wand. Tap it out. Twirl. Pour.

Either way I do it, there’s so many little bubbles. I sometimes feel like I get silky milk more when I’m trying to make a cappuccino than when I’m trying to make a latte. Tap it out. Twirl. Pour

And this isn’t about the crema - I swirl that before pouring in the milk. The milk itself in the pitcher prior to being poured into the espresso has tiny little bubbles.

*Where the Odds Favor Braga, but History Hints at Drama*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Primeira Liga showdown that’s equal parts “can’t-miss” and “wait, *who?*” Sporting Braga, fresh off a Europa League victory over Nice (yes, *that* Nice) and a 2-1 league thrashing of Famalicão, arrives at Estadio Braga Municipal as the prohibitive favorite. At decimal odds of 1.42–1.48, Braga’s implied probability of winning hovers around 68–70%—the kind of pricing that makes you check your coffee for foreign substances. Santa Clara, meanwhile, sits at 7.0–7.5, which translates to a 12–13% chance. In betting terms, it’s like asking if you’d rather bet on a squirrel winning a chess tournament or the rules of chess suddenly changing.

**The Numbers: A Tale of Two Trajectories**  
Braga’s recent form is as sturdy as a Portuguese custard tart—unbaked, but still structurally sound. Seven matches unbeaten (six wins, one draw), they’ve climbed to sixth in the league, three points shy of fourth-place Gil Vicente. Their attack? Efficient. Their defense? Less so—six of their last seven matches have seen at least five cards, making “Over 4.5 Cards” a bet as safe as leaving your keys in a taxi.

Santa Clara, though, is a work in progress. 11th in the table but buoyed by a 1-0 win over Casa Pia, they’ve shown flickers of promise under coach Vasco Matos, who claims the team is “growing an identity.” Translation: They’re learning to pass the ball without tripping over each other. Yet their historical meetings with Braga read like a horror movie: 10 straight losses. That’s the kind of streak that makes you wonder if Braga sprinkles *dragão* (dragon) DNA in their pregame meals.

The coffee grinds in there has happened before. When I use it, I am careful to clean it out and wipe the whole thing. It’s concerning how he didn’t even notice. He does this with plates too and he does not brush out gunk built up on the bottles with the brush I bought. I confronted him about it and it turned into a big fight about me being too critical and anxious about contamination/germs (this is true and I need to work on it).

1pn1gpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pn1gpi/5_months_post_break_up/,5 months Post Break up,"Hello viewers,

I know many of you just read my previous post and didn’t say anything, which I appreciate. I just want to give an update, I guess, on my life and how I’m handling the breakup and how I’m feeling now, five months later.

I made my prior post fully taking the blame for my ex’s and my relationship’s demise, but truthfully it wasn’t as cut and dry as I made it seem. It was a pretty rocky relationship throughout, and we had been broken up for about a month and some change when I decided to talk to the other guy. I know it seemed like I was truly unfaithful, but it was more me just dishonest and withholding that information from him. During the months leading up to our end, we had been off and on every other week, so it was destined for us to actually break up eventually. The timing of it all was just sucky, and I think that’s why it hit me so hard.

Not even a week or so after my intial post, my friend ended up showing me his dating profile on Hinge. I was initially super shocked, then confused, then the hurt came back flooding in 10x. I, in turn, decided to make my own dating profile (not a great decision). He kept popping up on my screen, and I would never swipe left. I would just exit the app because, truthfully, I liked being able to see his face and hear his voice again. I only spent about a solid week on the app before deleting it. Seeing his face constantly pop up and realizing he wasn’t hurting the way I was just angered me. I realized I was never going to heal the way I needed to if I stayed on that app, so I decided to just delete it.

It was a slow and painful start in the beginning. I kept trying to rationalize us getting back together and us not really being over, then I started manifesting and praying him back into my life, literally telling myself, “This man is my naseeb, we’re not over, we can’t be over”, oh but we were. After I came to the realization that things were actually over, reality started to feel unreal and warped. It was the weirdest feeling ever. I can’t even begin to describe how that time felt. But just as quick as that feeling came, it was gone… I just woke up one day and let go.

A new feeling arrived. At first it felt like nothingness. When I thought about my ex or saw a place we had gone to, I didn’t cry or feel sad. I felt absolutely nothing, like a hollow feeling. When I would hear a sad song or see cute coupley shit on my timeline, I would feel simply nothing. It felt like my heart would try to tell my brain to feel sad or cry and think about my ex, but it just wouldn’t. It was the strangest thing. I’ve never experienced an emotion of nothing before.

Eventually, the thoughts and memories of him turned into a very distant memory, and the nothing faded as well. In turn, it brought happiness and peace, an emotion I hadn’t truly felt in years. It felt like a warm blanket on a cold and rainy night, a cup of fresh coffee on a warm yet still morning just as the sun is rising. I felt like I was finally me again… the real and true me.

I haven’t started “dating” again, but I’m getting to know someone, and it’s been pretty nice actually. He is a lot different than what I’m used to, but I’m enjoying the new energy and environment he brings. Actually, funny enough, he invited me over to his house with his family for Thanksgiving. It was definitely super overwhelming for me, but I enjoyed it. His whole family is just as sweet as he is, and his mom likes me. Shortly after I went over for Thanksgiving, he brought up the topic of us taking our “relationship” to the next level (making me his gf then wife). I honestly wasn’t that enthusiastic about the idea, believe it or not. If we had met when I was still lost in the pleasures of this dunya, I would’ve jumped at the opportunity, but since my short but insightful healing journey, I just feel like I’m not ready for that quite yet. I just got back to feeling okay with life and myself. Heck, I was even just recently, like a month ago, healing some other aspects of myself I didn’t know needed healing.

I am absolutely ready for love and ready to find the person Allah deems right for me, but I’m also not in a rush. During my nothingness phase, I had a bunch of different sheiks on my FYP. A great deal of them were talking about haram relationships and halal ones. Within those videos, the one that stuck with me the most was where the sheik was basically saying that dating is not necessarily haram, it’s Western dating that is (now I know that seems like a crazy statement, but let me land). A lot of these haram relationships are built on love and desires that feed the flesh, which is not how it’s supposed to be. We’re supposed to build our relationships on our iman, beliefs, values, and things within that nature, then have love be the cake topper. Well, that’s what I want. I want to build my future relationship like that. I want my next relationship to be my last. Although I’ve always had the mindset of dating to marry and believed that all of my relationships, especially the last, were going to result in marriage, I want it to be true this time. I want to build and grow with the next person and create a bond that is unbreakable and that lasts a lifetime, rather than a year or two.

All in all, I am happy and at peace. Although there are times when I get anxious, stressed out, or even angry, the peace and happiness always end up trumping the temporary emotions I feel. And to my ex, I honestly have the utmost gratitude toward you. You allowed me to finally heal and let go of all my hurt and pent up emotions that have been keeping me stagnant throughout the years, and I believe that’s why Allah sent you to me. It was definitely an unpleasant experience in the beginning, but now that I’m at the end, it feels worth the tears and sadness. Surah Al Baqarah (2:286) يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا, which translates to “Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.” At that moment in time, it felt like Allah did give me too much to bear and deal with, but now, looking back, it was exactly what I needed to change and become the newer and better version of myself. I am forever thankful for you and our brief time together, and although I no longer yearn for you or grieve our connection, I will always still love you… not the same love as before or the love of longing, but a better love, the one that comes from gratitude…

And to the viewers, thank you for allowing me to be vulnerable and be able to vent and express my deepest thoughts and feelings. I hope you are all doing well and healing. Bye for now🤍",1,1765783567.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

we are currently traveling in Vietnam and are once again wondering about the safety of food regarding vegetables in soups or vegetables and salad as a side in Banh Mi, buns. 

Honestly, it’s hardly avoidable, just like ice. 

I know it’s recommended everywhere to avoid ice totally because of contamination that can occur during transport or use. 

But honestly, then I could only drink still water and hot coffee 😀 There are so many teas, coffees, smoothies, bubble teas here, all made with ice, and it seems everyone drinks them. Is the risk of getting sick really that high? It’s hard to believe, given the sheer number of upscale restaurants and venues with hundreds to thousands of reviews in the big cities....?! Kinda get the impression around 80% of drinks are made with ice here, especially in the hot south 😁

Also all the greens they put into the Pho, or salad besides Bun Chat etc... Can we at least consider the ice to be fine which is served at bigger restaurant and not the local outside food stalls?

First off: I am currently living and studying in Seoul and I have been here since August. Also posting this elsewhere cause kpop_uncensored won't approve the post.

Recently there was a post on this sub (kpop_uncensored) about how ifans (western fans specifically) seem to think a lot of groups are flops because they're more popular domestically than internationally. There were some very stupid takes in the comments, one being that Enhypen isn't that popular domestically (or at least less than internationally) cause they don't go on variety shows (???? Variety shows are NOT an indicator of a groups success?, variety shows can help but it's not the only way for a group to be popular in Korea; the comment lowkey insisting they're flopping domestically? Or that locals don't know them? That is just not true. Enhypen is VERY popular here in Korea. Their Seoul encore general sale sold out in seconds). Another was about stray kids basically flopping in Korea.

Now, there were a couple of people responding to my comments trying to dispute my claims of Skz not being popular here and responding to multiple people to really hammer home the point that Skz are flops domestically. Western fans seem to think charting, variety shows etc are indicators of a groups success without actually understanding anything. Skz's recent comeback, ""do it"", actually did really well domestically. Their albums are actually charting (domestically) on hanteo

ETA: by really well I mean sales wise. I know the song itself didn't chart but it did well. Karma did very well too, ceremony (despite being one of my least fave skz songs) was everywhere. I heard it in many shops and cafes especially mega coffee. Karma sold very well and most versions are unavailable at most kpop stores I've been to apart from a couple of member versions and the ceremony (?) version. Do it also mostly sold well too, hard to find hyunjin or Felix versions of the album TT

And, their recent concerts in Seoul sold out very quick. I missed out on tickets ㅠㅠ so if they're selling out a concert in Seoul, selling out their merch (at all the kpop stores I've been to, the Skz sections are barren because they sell out of merch so quick they're only left with older albums), I've also heard Skz songs playing at cafes, clothing stores, food stalls, etc, so if nobody knew who they were why would they play them? Not to mention seeing Felix's face everywhere I go lol. At every gongcha, when you order at a self-service kiosk, (btw Felix's face is on the kiosk, there's usually a standee, and he's on the wall and door...) Felix literally says ""Felix's favourite"" if you choose his pick, then at the end of the transaction he'll say ""have a good day!"", and you can get a cupsleeve with his face on it, and you can get coasters with his face on it. And every olive young you go into, or a makeup shop that sells Hera, there's Felix. I even see his ads for Hera on the subway. And for peppero day Skz were EVERYWHERE because they had a collab with peppero. ads on the subway, ads at GS-25, CU, 7-Eleven, and btw those peppero boxes sold pretty quick (they also had individual ones and I could never find Lee know anywhere he sold out everywhere, and I managed to snag a Felix before he sold out too). Also their skzoo merch is hard to find even here cause they sell out so quick. And their pop-ups? All reservation only and that books up almost instantly. My friend tried and missed out even tho reservations opened barely a minute prior. I even checked out two pop-ups to take pics from the outside and the line was crazy (also didn't see a single foreigner (well westerner, anyway) in the crowd at the latest skzoo pop-up in hongdae).

Also the bday cafes I went to for certain members were incredibly busy. And full of Koreans only. And organised by Koreans. Also I'm not saying skz are less popular internationally, or that they're one of the most popular groups domestically cause they are wayyy more popular in the west (I'm Australian and Aussies go crazy for skz), and they're not at the same popularity as say seventeen or even Enhypen or txt in Korea, but they're NOT the domestic flops y'all think or want them to be.

Anyway. Charting ≠ domestic popularity. Many popular groups songs don't chart or have wins, yet they still sell out and are incredibly popular. NCT wish don't have any charting songs rn but all their merch sells out instantly, their 3 day concert in Seoul sold out almost instantly. It's a fight to get into pop-ups. Riize fame charged at 100 but I think dropped out but they're insanely popular here too, despite many western fans wanting otherwise. BtoB are crazy popular here, I got the chance to see them live and the amount of melody's in the crowd was insane! Soooo many groups that are considered nugu in the west (not even internationally cause generally they're still popular in Japan and SEA) are NOT nugu or flops here. Including groups like ADP, Treasure, super junior (yes, I was at kwangya on their anniversary and the amount of Korean fans there buying their anniversary merch was crazy), etc.

I am a married Chinese introverted woman who is in my late 40's and have no children. I have been struggling with many years of mild depression, especially during the darker winter months. Over time, I have become quite isolated and as a result I haven't kept in touch with friends and we drifted apart. Add to that a move away from my friends and family, so now I'm in a city where I don't know anyone. With Christmas coming up, the loneliness has been feeling heavier than usual!

I am hoping to meet a few kind low key introverted women who are open to gentle friendships. Any age is fine though 40's - 60's is most ideal for my energy level. I am looking for peaceful low-emotional demand friendships, as my capacity is limited right now. I am not someone who messages or calls constantly and I don't like social media. I prefer to keep online communication minimal via Reddit or Wechat, and save most conversations for when we meet in person. I like friendships that unfold naturally and without pressure slowly.

I am also open to meets that include men, as long as they are in a group setting with other women present. I am married and feel most comfortable keeping things clearly platonic and in groups.

When it comes to getting together, I am comfortable with anything from once a month up to a few times a month depending if our chemistry really clicks, but not too frequent. I tend to hibernate at home a lot and need plenty of quiet time, so a relaxed rhythm works best for me.

Simple things feel best right now like:  
• indoor walks around Surrey Central or King George Hub  
• sitting together with a cup of tea or coffee  
• easy conversation (movies, books, anime, skincare, pets, crafting)  
• a crafting activity in a quiet corner of a cafe

I'm open to crafting such as knitting, sewing, or crocheting but I would be a complete beginner and would love to learn from any creatives! I also want to be honest about finances. I am managing a lot with mortgage and bills so my budget is VERY limited. I don't have motivation to get a better job due to the depression. Eating out like lunches or dinners are not in my budget, but indoor walks, free activities, and a warm drink are within reach. I can do the occasional lunch or dim sum once a month, but I have to carefully budget for it.

If you are also feeling a bit lonely, navigating depression (or seasonal winter depression), or simply craving gentle companionship, I would love to connect in the King George Hub and Surrey Central area. I prefer to stay close to home since my energy can be limited, and if my social battery starts to drain, it helps to be able to head home easily.

It changed how I see my days.,"About a month ago I came across a video from Alex Hormozi where he talks about tracking everything you do in 15-minute intervals. Not to become a productivity robot, but just to see where your time actually goes.

I'd tried time tracking before with apps that log hours per project, but it never stuck. This felt different because it's not about measuring work — it's about awareness.

So I committed to it. Every 15 minutes, I'd write down what I just did. Here's what I learned:

**The first week was brutal.**

I thought I worked hard. Turns out I was ""busy"" — not productive. I'd look at my log and see things like:

* 9:00 — Started working on project
* 9:15 — Still on project
* 9:30 — Checked phone, replied to messages
* 9:45 — Back to project
* 10:00 — Made coffee, scrolled Twitter
* 10:15 — Emails
* 10:30 — Back to project (finally)

Two and a half hours. Maybe 45 minutes of actual work. That was a wake-up call.

**Patterns I discovered about myself:**

1. My brain is sharpest between 8-11am. After that, I'm running on fumes for anything that requires deep focus.
2. I dramatically underestimate how long things take. A ""quick email"" is never 5 minutes.
3. Transitions kill me. Every time I switch tasks, I lose 10-15 minutes getting back into flow.
4. I lie to myself constantly. ""I'll just check this one thing"" is never one thing.

**What changed:**

I stopped scheduling important work in the afternoon. I batch similar tasks together instead of jumping around. I actually take real breaks now instead of pretending scrolling my phone is rest.

The biggest shift is psychological. When you know you're going to write down what you did, you think twice before opening Reddit for the third time in an hour.

**How I do it:**

At first I tried the spreadsheet method — setting reminders on my phone and logging everything in Google Sheets. It worked, but the friction was real. Unlocking my phone, opening the app, finding the right cell, typing it in... I'd skip entries because it felt like a chore.

So I ended up building a small app for myself to make it easier. Now I just get a notification, reply directly to it with what I'm doing, and it's logged. Took the friction down to almost zero.

Some days I still miss slots. Some days I forget entirely. The point isn't perfection — it's building the habit of noticing. After a few weeks, you start catching yourself in real-time without even needing the log.

**Is it for everyone?**

Probably not. It requires a certain level of honesty with yourself that can be uncomfortable. But if you've ever ended a day wondering ""where did my time go?"" — this will answer that question. You might not like the answer, but at least you'll know.

I M20 posted a couple months ago about me and my GF F20 arguing. She said she was late to work, but it turns out she had gone to the lake with her girlfriend and her girlfriends boyfriend. However, something felt off and I told her how I felt and it turned out she was lying to me and had decided to skip work and go to the lake with her guy friend. While I hadn't met this guy friend, he was very new to my girlfriend and me as she began talking to him a couple month into our relationship. Anyway, this guyfriend became very close to my girlfriend and began driving her places and inviting her over to his house after she got off. He also admitted to having feelings for her a few times, but that he wanted her ""as a friend"". After this, I began questioning this guy. I only heard about him from what my GF told me about him, but everytime she'd hang out with him and she'd snapchat me, he wanted to speak to me and he'd ignore me completely, which further felt very odd. She was also very short when she would be on the phone with me around him.

Fast forward a month after that lake incident with this guy, he invited her to his house and she obliged and decided to go there with him late at night. She told me he was being very close and personal with him, but she kind of liked it. This disturbed me very much so. He then invited her to the club with him alone and apparently he kissed her a few times but my GF told me it ""wasn't actually him"" as he was drunk, but I felt otherwise. She said she'd cut contact with him though after that as she ""felt she was getting too close to him and wanted to step back"". Anyway, a few weeks after that and he invited her to a Christmas event, she accepted and went. I told her it made me feel uncomfortable and reminded her that she told me she wasn't going to hang out with him anymore and she asked me if I trust her. She ended up going, and it made me so uncomfortable. I was irritated, but it's like I've almost become numb to it like if I say something, everything will go down, so I just went with the flow. A few weeks passed and everything was going well between us. I managed to throw away my irritation and look to the positives, but everything that has happened has lingered with me. Last week, she posted a snap saying ""Thank you babe 😘 ❤️"", holding a coffee. I learned about this from a family member who's always friends with her on snap. She saw the post and asked me, ""Are you with your girlfriend? She posted this snap."" I went to snap to find the post and asked my GF about it. I asked her why she posted that if I didn't get her a coffee, and she told me it wasn't directed towards me. I asked her who it was directed towards and she asked me if I trust her and how it seems like I don't trust her. I told her I was simply curious who she directed that to. She told me it didn't matter but then told me she refers to her friends as ""babe"" often. I was like, ""You know what, that makes sense. Some women do refer to their friends as babe"". 

That night, we were talking it out and she told me she slept with another guy friend before we were official and asked if that mattered to me. I told her it didn't matter as we weren't actually exclusive yet. It didn't match up though. That night she referred to when she slept with the guy friend, she said his girlfriend was there with him in the same apartment. I asked her about that and she said they broke up when she was there with him and they did it after the break up. Having  been lied to before by her, I tried to believe her, but I feel so disturbed about this as the stories don't match up and she has shown to lie about this stuff before. If she was the other one in that situation, who's to say she's not cheating on me. She has told me that she cheated on her ex out of anger that he cheated on her, but she told me that she was stupid for that. I thought it was over after that, but today she sent me an sms message saying ""You can come over I will wait for you 😘😉"". This once again started the cycle again. I asked her if this was meant for me and she said it wasn't. I asked her who it was from and she started sending me messages about our sex life. I figured she was trying to change the subject. I asked her once again who it was meant for and she said it didn't matter. I told her it did matter and that if she has feelings for someone, just let me know so I can move on. I told her it was flirtatious and she denied that. She's now sending me messages telling me everything was a mistake with me and she shouldn't have been honest about anything.

I really don't know what to do. I feel like an insecure piece of shit for this,  but at the same time, my trust for her is definitely damaged and for me that's hard to gain back. I've been together with her for 6 months now, and it has been constant conflict.",1,1765782762.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

We were in the same class. He always initiate the meet up like goinv for a coffee, go gym together and study together. One day, we went for a drink and both of us ended up in a hotel. We do the deed but later on he told me that his parents arranged his marriage with a girl. He told me that it is against his will. But he can’t do anything because it is in their tradition and his duty to his family. He told me that we can’t be together and stay as friends. His fiancé is also a student and they are ldr. The thing is he first lead me on and later told me about this. I think he knows before he even approached me that he has this kind of drama in his life. Why he do this? I don’t understand. Do guys were also in this kind of situation?

I don’t expect any commitment from him. Even I don’t expect anything from him. He’s the one who keeps initiating, every time. Even before I knew and after. ",1,1765782754.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Barely ten minutes after the scandalous photos made their debut online, the Twitter servers buckled under the weight of an internet frenzy.

“William Preston Cheats on Wedding Night” flashed across screens.

“Allison Grant, a Shameless Homewrecker” echoed in digital conversations.

“Caroline Whitman Catches Husband in Bed” surged to trending status.

The hashtags exploded into the public consciousness, igniting a wildfire of outrage and speculation.

My agent, Savannah Blake, stood nearby, her fingers gripping her phone with a white-knuckled intensity as it buzzed incessantly. She pressed the receiver to her ear, her complexion turning ghostly. “Carol, it’s William’s team on the line. And his mother is calling too.”

I nodded, urging her to continue despite the chaos swirling around us.

“They’re demanding you release a statement—something along the lines of the photos being movie stills or a misunderstanding from a drunken party,” Savannah explained, her voice wavering slightly.

A light chuckle escaped my lips, a sound laced with disbelief. “And why should I do that?

“I am William’s wife. My husband chose to abandon me on our wedding night to indulge in infidelity with his ex. Why on earth would I cover up his disgrace?”

“Savannah, do I look like someone who just rolls over and accepts every slight?”

She fell silent, her eyes wide, unable to counter my resolve.

The door swung open with a force that startled us both.

William stormed in, his eyes bloodshot, a storm brewing within them.

He clutched his phone so tightly that the veins in his hand bulged, a testament to his rising anger.

“Caroline! Have you lost your mind? Do you even grasp the magnitude of what you’ve done?”

With a forceful motion, he slammed his phone onto the coffee table before me, the screen illuminating the damning photos I had shared.

“Why did you do this? Ally did nothing wrong!”

His voice was a mix of desperation and indignation.

“She was feeling low, and I went over to have a drink with her. Nothing happened between us!”

I met his gaze with an unwavering calm, my heart racing but my expression steady.

“If that’s the case, then why was she draped in your shirt?”

“And why did you whisper her name all night while I lay in your arms?”

His face flushed crimson, embarrassment washing over him like a tide.

He had clearly underestimated my awareness of his drunken murmurs.

Then, in a sudden burst of frustration, he barked, “I was drunk!

“I merely made a mistake that any man could make!

“Did you have to turn this into a public spectacle? Are you intent on ruining Ally and my careers?”

“I never realized you could be this cruel!”

I stood up, the air thick with tension, and approached him with purposeful strides.

“William, you’re the one on the path to self-destruction, dragging your precious Ally and our marriage down with you!

“I’m the cruel one? Compared to the betrayal you and she orchestrated, I’m simply delivering justice.”

“Also, let me clarify something for you.

“Not all men make ‘mistakes.’ Only those who lack self-control do. Don’t drag the entire male population into your pitiful excuses.”

Fueled by rage, William raised his hand as if to strike me.

I didn’t flinch; I merely stared at him with cold resolve.

“Go ahead. Slap me, and tomorrow’s headline will scream, ‘Actor William Preston Commits Domestic Violence.’

“I can assure you that story will eclipse your little affair.”

His hand hovered in the air, frozen by the weight of my words, before it fell weakly to his side.

At that moment, his mother, Isabella Preston, the formidable Chairman of Summit Entertainment, called.

As I answered, her commanding voice sliced through the tension.

“Caroline, delete that tweet immediately. Then hold a press conference and issue an apology. Claim it was all a misunderstanding.”

“I’m not going to let you ruin our reputation.”

I reclined on the sofa, deliberately examining my perfectly manicured nails, feigning nonchalance.

“Mrs. Preston, I’m not the one tarnishing your reputation. Your son is the culprit.

“After the way he treated me on our wedding night, I’ve been more than generous by not filing for divorce.”

She fell silent for a moment, her anger simmering just below the surface. “What do you want? Resources? Money? Just name your price. Just kill the story.”

1pn0yzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pn0yzl/i_thought_i_was_the_one_for_her/,I thought I was the one for her,"Hey! In this message, I am going to talk about something that kept me awake last night. I don't know how I feel right now, but I am sure it is not good.

There's a girl in my friend group. One day, on the way home on the metro, we sat facing each other and had a good talk about her taekwondo career. Talking about it hurts, but maybe that was the moment I realised I liked her: I liked how she talked, I liked her opinions on random things, I liked her heart. I saw her holding back tears when we went to visit a friend in hospital. The scene of everyone suffering because of a cigarette they bought one day still hurts to this day.

There have been many times before this when I've had the thought that I might actually like her, but my mind has always underestimated my value in one way or another. I've always thought that I'm not good enough, either in terms of looks or maturity, even though when I look at myself in the mirror, I'm sure that I deserve something good. But my mind always tells me that I'm not good enough.

After that day on the metro, I sat with myself, trying to understand the nature of our friendship. I have never had a girlfriend before; I am 17 years old and have never dated anyone or had a crush. I started thinking about our relationship: when I am alone, I think about her and envisage a bright future, but when I am with her, I live in the moment.

Then one day she wanted me to ask her questions about her crush. The spark I had felt before had now become a fire. Was I the one she was talking about? Who was it? She started giving me hints, and it seemed as if everyone was pointing to two people: me and someone we'll call Rayn. I didn't know about this Rayn guy before he met her. We all know he has a crush on her and she knows too, but she lets him talk to her and sometimes they even meet up to talk about things. When she tells me things like that, I always feel confused. I know she's telling me because she doesn't want me to get mad or angry that she's wasting my time, but at the same time, it's weird that she's accepting his company as a ""friend"" when she knows he has a crush on her. And hanging out with him? That's even weirder.

She and I have been to many places around our country together, and we have experienced both good times and bad. So thinking it was me is not a mistake, but a reasonable guess.

Until yesterday, we were talking all night and having a video call on Discord, and I told her what I had said before, that I felt like you were hinting at something and that I was not sure about my feelings. Her response was good: 'I didn't mean to make you think about it like that. It's not you. That's not what I meant when I dropped some hints, but don't underestimate yourself. You're a good person.' I didn't know how to feel at that moment, so I laughed and asked her who her crush was. She refused to tell me, but I feel like it's Rayn.

The feeling of 'not being good enough' came back at that moment. The whole night I was just talking to myself, trying to understand. The thing that hurts the most is that I never tried to do anything to impress her or make her like me, but the fact that she considers me a good person is something I should be proud of. When we meet up, I bring her her favourite coffee.

We talked about many other deep things, such as why you don't just move and date him, given that you can actually date anyone you like. She said, ""I am scared of losing you and many friends, but I believe he is not strict, so I can still be friends with you."" So I said...

'Look, if you date someone, believe me, you will lose a lot of good friends. Actually, do you think it's worth losing that many people because of one person? A better question is: would you sacrifice a good, certain world for an uncertain better one? That question always makes me think a lot. I have friends and a crush — who would I choose? I know it's not an option, but it's a decision that would change a lot.'

She said, 'Maybe your friendship will decrease, but it won't disappear.'

'That's a lie you're telling yourself. When a friendship decreases or becomes distant, it disappears. Look, is it worth it?'

""I think it's worth it if the crush is certain.""

""Look, you know that you're like a sister to me, right? If I'm the reason you don't date this lovely guy you're talking about, don't consider me. Do what you want. If something bad happens, you're the one who's going to suffer, not us. It would break my heart if I lost you, but I know I can move on one day or another, so don't worry about me. Do what you want.""



She's a good friend of mine. The idea of her doing her skincare routine in front of me is crazy. When I laughed at her face and said, ""If he sees you like this, he'll reconsider,"" she responded, ""I think I might have sent him something like this before.""

That actually hurt me.

When we talked about going to get our ID cards from the police station, she said, 'I want to go alone.'

'I can go with you.'

""No, no, I want to be alone... or with him.""

""OK, shut up.""

It's heartbreaking that, despite how good I was to her, a little crush made me look like an annoying friend she's got. Even though I'm not, and we love talking to each other. While she's my favourite person, I'm just a random guy I guess. I love her, I like her, and I've never thought about her physically. I always see her soul with me. I don't know if I'm crazy or jealous, but I do like her, and I feel like I'm better than who she's thinking about. I treated her like a sister. It fucking hurts, man. It fucking hurts to be considered a normal person like everyone else in the mind of someone you really like.

1pn0utz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FalseBaker6883/comments/1pn0utz/what_is_rescue_dog_apparel_a_guide_for_dog_lovers/,What Is Rescue Dog Apparel? A Guide for Dog Lovers,"The rescue dog apparel is garment and accessories designed to honor dogs which are shelter and rescue dogs. Such things usually remind an adopted dog and its owner of the connection between them by creating meaningful pieces of art, messages, or drawings based on true stories of rescue. At the heart of this flow lies [**rescue dog apparel**](https://muttyprints.com/) that enables dog lovers to show the values they hold via daily wear and raise awareness in the field of adoption and shelter assistance. It is a kind of easy way to make sympathy without uttering any word.

https://preview.redd.it/gymfh742eb7g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=6394029d16c605fad32ce269a5ae7401d6dcc8e1

This means that, at the core of such clothing lies in narration. A lot of brands create works inspired by real-life rescue dogs, and occasionally present their story or character in the artwork. A shirt can be a lifeless drawing or a hoodie can include a quote that expresses strength or second chances. Such specifics make clothes a topic of discussion and talking about adoption and the truths of shelter animals is now easier.

Another identifying factor is purpose. Many of the rescue-related brands donate part of their profits to animal shelters, medical funds, or rescue organizations. Others collaborate directly with nonprofits and assist in covering food, care, and transportation of dogs awaiting homes. This correlation of purchases and impact puts value, particularly to the dog lovers who would like their expenditure to be consistent with their ideologies.

The emotional attachment of rescue dog apparel is what actually makes it different. Individuals who adopt or provide care to dogs are usually very proud of their experience. Donning clothes which are inspired by the rescued dogs is a form of reflection of that experience. It is a sign of patience, caring, and the happiness of providing a dog with a second opportunity. These designs are frequently worn even by the people who have not adopted yet as one way of supporting the cause and demonstrating respect towards the rescue work.

Style is also a matter of concern. The modern rescue inspired apparel is geared towards everyday routine. You will have casual sweatshirts, easy-to-wear tees, easy-to-wear hats, and convenient accessories that can be easily included in the current lifestyle. The playful and colorful designs are as well as the subtle and minimalist designs, which is why it is available to a wide variety of personal styles. This day-to-day practice is useful in normalizing adoption culture as opposed to introducing it as an alien concept to daily living.

The other value is the community it brings about. Small visual details are the common means by which dog lovers can identify shared values. A catchy t-shirt or just a catchy phrase can motivate people to have friendly conversations in the park, the office of the veteran or in a coffee shop. Such events create unity and remind humans that they are part of an extended community that cares about animals and promotes adoption.

The independent creators and small businesses are also supported by the rescue-inspired clothing. A large number of such brands are initiated by dog owners, artists or rescue supporters who desire to make a difference in their own manner. Making a decision among these collections usually seems more intimate than to purchase mass-produced items, particularly in case the legend behind the design is obvious and emotional.

Accessories are also an in thing to be supportive. Hats, tote bags, and prints are also subtle yet can be used on a daily basis and can be considered a nice gift to a fellow dog lover. One example of a casual wearable item that subtly gives pride to rescue is a [**dog mom trucker hat**](https://muttyprints.com/collections/rescue-dog-mom-hats) in the middle of this category and can fit in the daily routine.

https://preview.redd.it/6xo23mx5eb7g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=73cdf413145fc199da3dfee0bde4db54cf7b308d

The idea behind this is timeless due to its close connection with the lifestyle of dog lovers and their interests. It is not about the fashion or the things that are said in order to attract attention. It is relating, caring, and giving tribute to the dogs that transformed our lives. Each item worn contributes to the continuity of rescue-related stories and reminds people of the fact that adoption is to be celebrated always.

My dad owns a framing business and is very passionate about what he does. Unfortunately, he is also passionate about flatly refusing to tell me what he would like for Christmas. At this point, I am out of time and out of ideas. 

That being said— is there any special tool, gadget, accessory, or even general creature comfort that you enjoy while working? I would appreciate any suggestions!

I have two siblings, and I’m the youngest. My oldest brother is without a doubt the golden child, and not to get too personal but there was one day he literally threatened to end my life and he was throwing things around. My mom was also there that day, and defended him. I ran away scared. They obviously haven’t apologized, much less talked to me about what happened. Years later, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I can quite literally feel my nerves being ignited anytime I’m near them: I get migraines, my jaw hurts, my left shoulder hurts, I sometimes even get a tingling feeling on my arms. My mom has also hurt me, in quite literally all the ways a child can be hurt. Even the one that comes across your mind. But her abuse has been more subtle, more psychological and verbal than physical. Yet it’s been ongoing but has somewhat stopped because I’ve been greyrocking for years.

Thing is, I love my sister so much. She’s my best friend (quite literally adopted me into her friend group when I was younger and didn’t have friends). We’ve done so many things together: we’ve traveled, gone to concerts, gone for coffee runs, gone shopping, studied together until late, gone to the movies, etc. At every graduation and important life event.

In one family therapy session (which of course never works when applied to a dysfunctional, toxic, narcissistic family) I admitted that my mom’s abuse had been so big, and even revealed that she used to hurt me in that way. Of course she denied and asked ME to apologize to her for the “false accusations”. When that therapy session was over, my sister and I went for coffee and she told me she didn’t know that the abuse was that bad.

Yet my sister seems to get along with and love the people who not only have hurt me, but that have hurt us both. I don’t get it. I know it can be a fawn response, or a trauma bond. But I would never bake cookies with a person who threatened my sister’s peace, much less her life. I’d never play video games with the man who caused my sister to develop PTSD. Yet she does. 

Recently, it just slipped out from me but I said to my sister that my mom and I aren’t close, and she said “well that’s too sad, she loves you”. Uhm??? And now my sister is talking of hosting a gathering with friends for Christmas. I just can’t host an event and be a gracious co-host next to a person that equates abuse of all forms with love. I just can’t. It’s why I can’t be around my Nmom and GC brother in the first place. 

My sister will never get it. I know my brother and mother are narcs and they never would get it, but my sister? The most emotionally intelligent person I know doesn’t? It stings very much. She used to understand me, know she probably thinks I have a family-hating agenda and she thinks I’m immature.

So yeah: I’m struggling. I love my sister very much, but I would’ve never done the things she’s done. For the record, I know there’s a chance that I might be overly dramatic/sensitive (both my therapist and psych have said so). Even my therapist understands the impact my mom’s and brother’s actions have caused on my mental health, but she says that I’m overreacting because I clearly wasn’t in danger (but I very much felt like I was dying when I was threatened, I had a panic attack and had to run, but okay).

I just think that when you love a person, you hate the things and people that hurt them beyond repair. 

I also want to say that I don’t see have a holier than thou attitude, I just can’t fathom my sister’s thought process. I have even asked her many times and she said that it’s too complicated to explain or that she doesn’t owe me an explanation. Okay then…

The first one he was young, sipping coffee at a cafe in the sun reading the paper and happy not a care in the world. He didn’t talk to me, I was just watching from afar. He looked healthy, relaxed and happy.

I’ve been really struggling lately and the second was him talking to me (looking young again), he put his hands on my shoulders and said “I’m okay sweetheart” and he then said that he had to go and left. The second one is hitting me hard. I think because part of my coping is that I think he’s always close but the fact that he said he had to go makes me think all my grief and yearning for him is keeping him stuck and that he needs to move on and that I shouldn’t be sad. I’m not sure what to think. Is that it, is he just gone now. The only comfort I’ve been getting is signs and feeling like he might be in another dimension but still close but maybe he’s not…",3,1765780699.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

Sorry I’ve been posting quite a lot here these few days. I usually am secure of my stance on my Nfamily, but every once in a while I find out there are things I still don’t know how to navigate.

Hence my question: have you forgiven or even managed to have a relationship with a sibling (or siblings) who defend and love the Nparent?

That’s my question. But here’s my story:

I see so many posts where parents talk about never getting a moment of peace, a second to themselves, etc.  For many of us, family is unable or unwilling to help.  Same wtih friends.  Back when I was diagnosed wtih cancer ten years ago a neighbor literally said, ""Anything you need, I'm there.  But I can't watch your son.""   So what if we, the parents, created our own local groups of parents whose kids are on the spectrum and we became each others' support?  Not just a get-together-and-vent support group.  Rather, a group of parents willing to step in and watch each others' kids so someone can run an errand in peace or just get a cup of coffee and sit in silence ofr an hour?  

I haven't thought much beyond that, but who better to do this than another parent who's been in the trenches?  Someone who isn't shocked or put off by our kids' behavior, or freaked out if they have to work harder to understand what a kid is asking for.  ",6,1765780593.0,Autism_Parenting,10,1.0,False

Coffee break? Laziness. 5 minute stretch? Wasting time. Turns out my brain was sabotaging me: it kept me in a cycle of “work faster, do more” but without ever actually focusing. Last week I forced myself to schedule micro-breaks every 45 minutes. At first I thought it would reduce output. Nope. I started finishing tasks faster and felt less exhausted. The weird part? Giving myself permission to pause actually made my focus sharper. Productivity isn’t about working nonstop, it’s about giving your brain the right rhythm. Who else learned this the hard way?
