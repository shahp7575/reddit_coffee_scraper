Started in earnest 01 Feb 2023

**I know this is going to work, now I need to carry on carrying on.**



**Why I’m learning Spanish**

I’m 55 years old this week, I’m an English bloke who has had very little contact with foreign languages.  I failed my French exams twice when I was 16, and only just passed my English exams.

Through a combination of hard work and huge amounts of luck I was able to retire when I was 47 with just enough money to get by for as long as I expect to live, this gives me the time to learn Spanish but only if I can do it cheaply.

I live in the North of England where I have never heard Spanish spoken by a native in my city.

I stopped telling people I was learning Spanish last year, because it was a waste of breath, but if asked I will say I do it because I try to spend 3-5 months a year in Spain and speaking Spanish would be useful.  But in reality I don’t need Spanish where I stay in Spain, nobody wants to talk Spanish there, they all want to practice their perfect English.

The REAL reason I am learning Spanish isn’t at all acceptable to say out loud, so don’t tell anyone…

Most English people are entirely ignorant of other languages, I can hardly blame them, when other Europeans learn a second language it’s almost always English, because it’s a world language.

Whereas aged 12 when I was sat down and asked if I wanted to learn French, Italian or Spanish I hadn’t even left my country and had zero contact with any foreign people, so it didn’t matter which I chose, they were all useless to me!  

A French person who speaks English can add 50% to their salary, and English person who speaks French can order a coffee in a bar in France.

So I’m learning Spanish for two reasons, firstly because I want to prove to any Spanish people that I meet that not all Brits are ignorant oafs. Secondly to prove to myself and others who told me I couldn’t do it, that I can, and then speak badly of them behind their backs in Spanish.

I know, my reasons hardly sound like an acceptance speech for a Nobel Peace Prize, but we can be honest here.  In fact number 3 has just popped into my head, speaking Spanish will make me look cool and more sexy, the ultimate motivation trifecta, embarrassment, revenge and vanity….



**Materials I’m using now**

YouTube videos on science / fitness / cycling / language learning

Reading Level B1 books ok, struggling with B2

Very recently started talking with AI - Languatalk - amazing

Started writing today, just short sentences



**What I can do**

Listening - I am doing very well with YouTube videos, where usually there is one person talking to the camera, only the fast or most mumbled natives, such as for some reason car reviewers, drop my comprehension to such a level that I have to abandon the video.

Reading - I’m probably at level B1 of reading, if Juan’s graded readers are accurate, I’m finding his B2 work too difficult.

Writing - Not really tried.

Speaking - Get’s it’s own section



**What I can’t do**

I can’t watch TV YET, I try about once a month, but it still hasn’t clicked with me. I can’t watch Bluey or Peppa Pig as I hate them, I actually didn’t even like cartoons like this as a child, I preferred Tom and Jerry or Science programs.

I find it difficult to read the titles of YouTube videos even though I can understand the whole video, I think it may be the style in which the titles are written, to grab attention rather than be “traditionally correct”.



**THE BIG QUESTION - CAN YOU TALK WITH PEOPLE**

I have practiced around 6 hours of talking with an excellent AI bot on level Intermediate.

So the short answer is no, I don’t think I can talk to people fluently, but I can understand them when they speak to me and if absolutely necessary I can get them to understand mostly.

Before you all throw your hands up in despair, I can still remember the first few hours of speaking (as it was only last month) and I was appalling. But in the space of 6 hours practice I can say without doubt that my improvement rate is exponential.  I really can’t believe it myself.   

They key improvement is that words seem to be appearing in my head with little effort, don’t get me wrong, I am still very much struggling for all the words I want to use, and I haven’t even started to think about how bad I sound, but most of the words are coming from nowhere.

In a sentence I may struggle for precise tense, “connector words” or vocab, but I can feel that coming.  In the first everything was a mess, by the fifth hour I was looking up connector words and managing with better accuracy the present tenses and some of the past tenses. I can feel the improvements each hour, but it is mentally exhausting.



**Going forward**

Mission - Become conversationally fluent in Spanish but with a sexy English accent

Overall Plan - Continue to log listening / speaking and reading until I have 2000 hours listening, 100 hours speaking and 1 million words reading, then just continue.

Method - Average 100 minutes per day over each month of listening / speaking, then read for half an hour.  Days off are allowed… but not many

When I have 50 hours or so of AI talking in the bag, I’ll look to a local language group for an language exchange.

Expected completion April 2026 for above objectives and then continue forever

Okay hear me out — I’m 29, living in Bangalore, and trying very hard to “put myself out there” (whatever that means in 2025).
Now let’s set the bar right here:

I’m not conventionally attractive — not the girl you double tap for her selfie. But I’m smart. Really smart. Witty things just fall out of my mouth. I’m funny, sharp, can talk about gaming, superheroes, politics, geopolitics, and occasionally cry over a good finance spreadsheet. I drink, I smoke, I smoke up — I’m honest about it. So there’s that.

I’ve tried dating apps. Made the effort. Wrote a good bio. Still — crickets. Or worse, creepy one-liners.

What I’m looking for is super simple:
I’d love to meet men (preferably 30+) with sorted careers and a sorted life. Not here for one-night stands or messy situationships. I’m more of a “let’s meet and see where it goes” kinda person. The slow burn, the coffee dates, the banter — that’s my jam.

But HOW does one even meet people organically in this city?

We’re all working 9-10 hours a day, and by the time the weekend hits, we’re buried under laundry, groceries, or recovering from the existential crisis that is adulting. I’ve tried stepping out more, but I don’t even know where to go or what to attend to find people who are also looking to date with intention.

So —
Where are the good men in Bangalore hiding?
Are there any events, spaces, communities that help people meet each other without pressure but with the possibility of something meaningful?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or even just stories about how you met someone without relying on the usual swipes. Let’s romanticize reality again, please?

Also, if you’re a decent, emotionally available man reading this… say hi?

1jory4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jory4a/my_best_friend_with_borderline_personality/,My best friend with borderline personality disorder broke up with me. I feel empty now...,"I'm posting again because there was an update.

Starting from the beginning...

I'm 20 years old, and a few months ago, I started seeing a 23-year-old woman. I'll call her J.

J and I had an instant strong connection, but things have been really difficult between us.

From the start, it was already hard to go out with J (it took about 2–3 attempts before we finally went out), and even after we did, things didn't get any easier.

J has borderline personality disorder, trauma from her ex-boyfriends, and from the beginning, she said she didn’t want a relationship.

The problem is that, at the same time J acted this way, she also showed signs of wanting something serious—being romantic, giving gifts to me and my family, wanting me to go out with her and her family, and, believe it or not, getting jealous.

Anyway, despite the good moments we had, these past months have been a constant cycle of her wanting to distance herself during crises and me always being patient, trying to talk to her and make her feel better.

Things went on like this until mid-November, when we broke up for good. She said we should just be friends and wouldn’t be together anymore.

Around that time, I randomly met a girl on Instagram (I’ll call her N). N ended up helping me during that time and even gave me advice about my situation.

J and I had some fights before, but I consider this one the worst.

It was December, and I was on my way home from work when J messaged me saying she had woken up wanting to have sex and was going to do it because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she had been with before her last ex).

I tried to talk to her at the moment because I was upset, but instead of replying, she went to play League of Legends.

The next night, after things had cooled down, I brought it up again. J said she didn’t actually do it but also didn’t admit she was lying. She just said she lost interest.

Then, I decided to tell her that N had invited me to hang out (which was true). I told her that this girl didn’t seem to have any romantic interest in me—it really seemed like just friendship. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing at her house with her friends.

I told J and asked if I could go. I even said that if she wanted, we could date, and I wouldn’t go. That I was only considering it because she didn’t want to be in a relationship with me.

J said it was fine, but from her tone, I could tell it wasn’t.

The next day, J teamed up with her cousin and pretended to be on a date to make me jealous. That’s when she finally admitted she had said all that just to test me. She also compared me to her ex-boyfriends.

She blocked me on the messaging app, and in desperation, I ran out of my house to go to hers, bringing a bouquet and some things she liked (energy drinks and chocolate) to try to fix things. I also messaged N, told her we couldn’t talk anymore, and blocked her.

In the end, J and I made up, but now things have gotten even worse.

Some time after the fight, J said I messed up by blocking N, and even though she told me to unblock her, I remained firm in my decision to keep N blocked.

However, after thinking about it for a while, I realized I had been really unfair to N, and it didn’t make sense to keep her blocked because of J.

J had been honest with me from the start and always said she didn’t want anything serious (even though I felt otherwise). She always made it clear that I was her best friend.

Because of that, a few days ago, I ended up unblocking N and apologizing to her. She accepted, but she told me not to drag her into this again.

But here’s the thing—I didn’t tell J that I was going to unblock N.

On Saturday, J and I went out for coffee and were talking when we got to the topic of our last (now second-to-last) fight.

She wanted to see the girl’s profile, and since she insisted, I ended up telling her that I had unblocked N.

From that moment, her mood changed, and she wanted to go home. That night, we were supposed to watch a reality show together, but she didn’t want to anymore. Just after midnight, she sent me a video of her crying. I tried to talk to her, but she said I hadn’t been honest with her.

Yesterday, things only got worse. She said all she wanted was honesty and told me I was never honest with her, that I always lied, and that she didn’t want to have a friend who was a liar.

I kept trying to talk and calm her down, but it just got worse. She called me, cried harder than she ever had before because of me, and asked for N’s profile.

She followed N, N messaged me, and I explained the situation to her. N got mad at me, said that J and I were crazy and immature, and that she had bigger problems than this. She said she never had any romantic interest in me and that our friendship was dead. Then, she blocked both me and J.

I told J what happened, and she asked for screenshots, which I showed her. That made her feel even worse. She sent me a long message saying she forgave me but that it would be better if we went our separate ways. That she couldn’t pretend nothing had happened.

I insisted and insisted until she got angry and blocked me (something she had said she wouldn’t do).

I was blocked on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and even on several fake accounts I made on Facebook to try to talk to her.

I even went to her house with chocolate and a letter, saying I was at the park near her house, but she didn’t come out or unblock me. Only after I started sending her 1-cent bank transfers with messages did she unblock me—being extremely rude and telling me to leave her alone. Then, she blocked me again.

Today, I found out she spoke to my mom… She told her I was harassing her and that if I continued, she would call the police and file a report.

I sent a few more 1-cent transfers to try to talk to her, but she said the same thing. That she forgives me but doesn’t want any more contact, and that if I keep going, I’ll have to deal with the law.

I sent a few more transfers apologizing and saying it would be the last time, but she refunded everything, and that was it…

I haven’t showered, I’ve been crying non-stop, and I feel completely devastated. The doubt still lingers—was I the asshole in all of this? But in the end, it’s all my fault… I wish I had been a better friend to J.

Boulardii :),"I've been working to target, what I believe, is my underlying conditions with SIBO and Candida/SIFO. Artichoke (1000mg) & Ginger (1000mg) have helped tremendously, Apple Cider Vinegar helped too but I noticed it made me flare up a bit, so I started taking probiotics, specifically S. Boulardii. I think this has been quite helpful, but I've been getting a big flare up in my rosacea after I take it now and I've been wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation.

For background, my symptoms are :

* Rosacea (type 1 & 2) - sulfur washes & Azelaic Acid helped with this a lot, as well as Vit C
* Brain Fog - the artichoke helped with this
* diarrhoea - the boulardii helped with this, however, it's now making my rosacea worse
* Bad dandruff/psoriasis - 99% gone with everything + Ketoconazole
* Insomnia - didn't realise this was HIT/SIBO related! Still somewhat there
* Food intolerances - the Ginger and Artichoke have been amazing for this. For some reason I would break out in cystic acne if I drank unfiltered coffee, ate chocolate, drank matcha... as well as this, anything would break me out so I started waiting an hour after eating before drinking which worked for 2 years before something changed in my gut and I realised I needed to address the underlying issue.

  
So, with all of this laid out, does anyone have any idea why the S. Boulardii - for which I've only heard amazing things - is causing my rosacea to flare up fairly immediately? 

Thank you very much taking the time to read this and I also want to say that I'm grateful for this community. I think I've had this for condition for 15+ years, figured out how to manage symptoms along the way but have only recently started looking towards curing my gut dysbiosis.

Baby is 10 months old next week and is super happy all day, naps really well but nighttime is horrendous. I often feed to sleep because i am too tired to do anything else but sometimes that doesn’t even work. If i put him down in his crib he wakes up within 5 minutes but sometimes can last 2 hours on a great night. 

We’ve tried cosleeping (he won’t sleep, just wants to eat or play). I don’t think it’s silent reflux since he has no symptoms of it. I just don’t know. 

I let myself have a cup of coffee for the third time since he was born today because i couldn’t get through without it. My marriage is in a bad place because we never spend time together, we just take turns trying to get sleep on the weekends and holding baby. I can’t go anywhere with baby because it would be dangerous to drive sleep deprived. We don’t have any family that would be willing to hold him in the early hours.

I feel like I had kind of a breakthrough at work. 

There’s usually this period where I have all the freedom to binge on all the snacks I want So I usually make a selection between TV Dinners/ Cookies, Candies or Icecreams. It’s usually after a period of high-stress from customer complaints or feeling like I‘m not good enough To have the life I am working towards. 

*Then it hit me.* 

Even though I feel like I can’t fight this urge to binge, I can still change WHAT it is I decided to eat. 

Instead of getting all of the snacks I normally get, I decided on Oatmeal, Bananas and of course heaps of sugary coffee creamer. 

Still might not be the most amazing revolution but I feel like it’s small choices like these that lay the foundation for truly embracing that difference. 

I don’t always have to do this to myself, but even if I feel like I have to , having that split second to just change WHAT it is I eat changes everything.

1jorl7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1jorl7k/rude_banking_exec_turned_lift_surfer/,Rude Banking Exec turned lift surfer,"Back in 2007 I was working as part of the Faciliites Management Team at a prestigious tower block at 25 Canada Square, within London’s Canary Wharf (Financial District)

We housed the European leadership teams of many worldwide household names such as CitiBank, Lehmans , Bank of America all major players on the global stage.

It’s fair to say that most of the occupants within the building were kind and respectful and treated me and my team well; whether it was a “Hi how are you”, or random acts of kindness such as offering to pay for my whole team to celebrate solving a problem with the HVAC system that had been going on for months and months, or just a bit of friendly banter.

There were, however, exceptions including a very rude senior executive who we will call “Karen” from Lehmans brothers (the defunct bank that got caught with its trousers down in 2008, a year after my petty revenge.

This exec was a particularly nasty piece of work, I had seen her being rude to her staff in public spaces and generally. This ranged from shouting at them , ordering them to make her coffee or to fetch things; all done without any eye contact, nor balanced (from my observation) of some positive aspects of leadership (such as saying thankyou).  The tower housed supermarkets and other facilities, where I and others would observe her barging past people in queues due to her own self-importance. She certainly was one of the elite, she had a large office with her name on the door,  her own parking spot in one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in the city, which she only used one day a week, and refused to let anyone else use it when she wasn’t in.I think you get the picture – right?

As with all buildings we have a bunch of mandatory checks to perform to ensure that the equipment is safe and effective in use, but as with mechanical equipment sometimes it fails and requires additional maintenance – that was the scenario with this particular lift. We worked long hours and outside of core office hours to ensure the building was working like a well-oiled machine, however we had a problem removing, then sourcing and refitting a faulty transponder which wasn’t quite working properly, this was now fixed and very close to entering service following the final checks to ensure everything was working as planned, lift 5 was out of action.

Picture the scene - We had just finished our annual planned emergency fire evacuation drill, the tower has been emptied of its occupants (roughly 2,000 on that particular day) so after the test was complete there was a predictable huge demand for the lifts, with only 7 of the 8 available to take passengers to their place of work.

Most people had planned for this and formed orderly (British style) queues to get back to work, with the exception of Karen. She strutted around the ground floor proclaiming how ridiculous it was that a lift was out of action and that she would be late for a Board meeting with the Global leadership team in the USA (yada, yada, yada, yada). She was barking instructions at her young, and stressed PA who was following her around like a loyal dog would to its owner whilst calling her colleagues to explain how ridiculous it was that the building was not in full working order. ""These brits need to learn a few things regarding efficiency"".

I was close by standing by lift 5 when she came and asked if she could skip the queue and jump in. I said it was undergoing final tests before being put back into use so it wasn’t possible to use it for 10 more minutes; clear signage showed the lift was not to be used, I explained I was sorry but it wasn't possible.

I had to take a radio call from David the lift enginner so turned my back slighlty so as not to disturb her.  Unfortunately for Karen she had jumped into the lift alone; in the vein hope of getting back in time for her urgent meeting; despite there being clear signage at the entrance and inside the lift saying do not use.

I turned around and saw the lift doors closing, just catching sight of her inside and saw the opportunity to exact revenge.

David , the lift engineer, who was connected to the control system waiting my command to commence the final transponder checks. This comprised the lift following a set test algorithm. It rose to each floor then stopped for 5 seconds (to ensure the floor sensors are calibrated properly) before repeating on every floor on the way back to the lobby. This whole process always took 10 minutes.

So it transpired Karen had 10 glorious minutes in lift 5 surfing the 45 floors of 25 Canada Place in the heart of London’s financial district, before arriving back in front of me, with the doors opening as I was radioed by Mark to confirm the test had been successful and that the lift could be put back into use.

I took great pleasure in using more of her valuable time as I asked for her name and company details so that I could record this as a Health and Safety incident in the log book. She had failed to follow Health and Safety procedures and in doing so was in breach of Lehman’s agreement with the building owners and operators so this was an important detail I had to capture and report to the company formally.

Luckily there were still a few people remaining who took great delight in seeing this terrible woman being held accountable for her actions.

Normally to get to the 25th floor would have taken her 45 seconds, it actually took her about 15 minutes :-)

I did see her from time to time afterwards, but I never saw any change in her behaviours sadly.

Actually the last time I saw her was in 2008 about a week before her colleagues from Lehman’s were leaving the buildings with plundered IT equipment as they tried to ensure they got some value from the company that collapsed around them.

Alright, friends, let’s have a heart-to-heart. Ever feel like your to-do list is plotting a hostile takeover of your life? 🤔 I've been there. What if I told you that there’s a nifty little trick called ""time blocking"" that could save you up to 10 HOURS a week? Yep, you heard right. Ten. Whole. Hours. Interested?

Imagine this: it’s Monday morning. You've got your coffee in hand, feeling like a productivity powerhouse. But by noon, you’re drowning in emails, chores, cat videos (just me?). That’s where time blocking comes in to save the day! Or week, rather.

**Here’s how I got started:**

- **Know Thy Time:** First, I tracked what I *actually* do in a day. Spoiler: I was spending more time deciding what to do than doing it. Mind-blowing, right?

- **The Game Plan:** I began by *blocking time* for specific activities—15 minutes for emails, 30 minutes for lunch, and yes, even 20 minutes for a cheeky scroll through my Instagram. 📱

- **Stick to It:** Here's the hard truth, and I’m being real here: It's not magic. It takes discipline. But once I got the hang of it, I found time I didn't know I had!

- **Flexible, Not Fickle:** It’s OK if things don't go as planned. Life happens. But this is about building structure, not a prison cell. Feel free to shift things around when needed.

Guess what? I gained more than just hours—I gained sanity. 🧘‍♂️ And hey, uncovered a new love for afternoon power naps.

Here's what surprised me: It’s not just about productivity but also learning what I truly value in my day. When you map out your time, *you* decide what matters. So, if you’ve been wondering, “Is this *really* something I need?” give it a go. 

Are you ready for this challenge and the surprising boost it brings? Give it a try, and see where it leads you! After all, who couldn’t use an extra ten hours a week?

But I struggle wit memory which is spontaneous and out of routine.

For example, I made a cup of coffee at work, then suddenly my colleague ask for help as he struggle to open a shelf. I will put my coffee away and help my colleague. I forgot I made a coffee and I made a 2nd cup.

Then my boss called me to his room as there is an important client suddenly called in and want me to give my input. I put my cup somewhere. I forgot again I made a coffee.

Then suddenly there is a fire alarm and all of us need to evacuate, luckily it just some garbage behind caught on fire and we are allowed return. I forgot I made a coffee and made a 4th cup of coffee and have other 3 coffee cup in the office which I have no memory I made it.

I only remembered when the cleaner put the ""unclaimed"" cup near the pantry..

Another example is when I reached home, and when I am on my way to put my keys to the key holder. My mom called. I am sure I never moved from the spot and the keys in my hand when i answer the call, and when the call is over. The keys is no longer in my hand and it's outside the house where I never went there.

Please note these first couple chunks are me just venting and coming true about my life and family, I’ll mark the part of the post where I actually get to the point.

Growing up, my childhood was very somewhat rocky when it came to having a home to stay in, my mother left my birth father due to him neglecting me, and due to that, we spent our lives in different apartments or homes belonging to several different friends or family, constantly being babysat and sometimes I wouldn’t even see my mom for a couple of days due to her working. Some days miserably spending our nights inside her car, given the same old “camping” excuse. It then escalated to moving from California to Texas, living with my grandma and grandpa in their separate homes, it was much more comfortable, yeah. But my entire family pretty much lived in Texas too, so I was sharing a room now with about three other people, and it was VERY busy.

So when my mom introduced me to her new boyfriend, who would then become my step father, I was pretty giddy that I would at least have a father figure in my life. Even if I was hesitant in admitting he was even one at first.

He was great, he was fine with the fact I don’t think I’d ever be comfortable with actually calling him “Dad”, he always got me small little gifts, and shared his love with rock music with me, and very much adored my mom. After he’d been around for a couple months, us three had rented out an actual home, and it was an amazing feeling. To actually have my own room, living room, dining room, and not have to really just SHARE anything with an additional five people at least.

However, that happiness didn’t really last long, after about eight months of living there, my stepfather had started to say how he doesn’t like staying in Texas, that he’d think it would be way better for all of us to live in California again, where he could have better access to his job, and so that he could see his daughter, which at the time, I think she was around two or three.

It ended up happening, to make things short, my mom wasn’t too excited, but she held her hopes high, telling me in attempts to cheer my mood that my favorite aunt lived out there, and that there are many fun things to do out there (which I will admit, she is not wrong about, California has practically everything except stable weather and nice schools.)

I was not excited however, I did NOT want to leave my family, school, and friends behind, and cried the whole way towards California.

But uhm, anyways, that was just some background story, I think this is where I actually start getting to the point.

I didn’t start hating my stepdad at this moment before you guys start to suspect that, ha-ha no. I was upset, sure, but I adapted to living, we got a small two bedroom apartment, I went to school and made friends, it was good…until my stepsister started to make more appearances.

I won’t sugarcoat it, I don’t like my stepsister, I actually hate her in fact, and in a way, I’m guilty to admit that I don’t feel any regret saying that, I. Hate. Her.

The two of my now parents did their best to try and hype me up by saying how much it would be awesome to play the ”big sister” role, I just never cared for her, from the start, and I don’t think I can use the excuse of being an only child inflicting my behavior, because I have literally shared my things with so many family members, I wasn’t really sure how to label something as just MINE.

But, anyways. She was a brat. She still is, at eleven years old, which pains me to say it, because I can go on all day about how pathetic her progress of growing up has been going, but I will do that…later! I’m a bad person, but we’ll get to it.

Her mom and my stepdad split, so she would share around three to four days with us at the apartments, and when she did, it was hell. She would cry every single day, and make her dad do almost everything for her. Hungry? Cry. Wanted something? Cry. Got told no, oh how dare you! Now she won’t shut up the entire day, it was draining. It was draining for me, and everyone in the apartment.

It started to really affect my mom’s behavior as well, this was the start of her hating my sister.

My mom makes it very clear she does not like bratty children, thankfully I was pretty well behaved and didn’t really need a good smacking or talking to, but being the Hispanic mom she was, she never hesitated to fix anything she thought was bratty about me, or threaten me with a good ass-whooping with the mop.

So, seeing the way she just couldn’t do anything about my stepdads poor parenting, it almost drove her crazy, and since she couldn’t really talk any sense into him or my sister, she took it out on me. So, for two years in that fucking complex, she would take her anger out on me, not hitting me, before any of you get the wrong idea, she just yelled at me a lot for the tiniest things, always called me ungrateful, and even for a short period (8 months) didn’t even bother trying to talk to me or hang out with me. Just telling me things related to dinner or school work. It really sucked, and did a number on me mentally.

I would like to cut in and just say some things about my family members, including myself, because I think it’ll help illustrate and help the understanding of what I’ll say later in this post better.

1. My mom, is not a good person. I know it, my family knows it (but will defend her with their lives, including me) and even she knows it. She’s a massive gas lighter, and makes sure that if you’re in an argument with her, she will in fact win. I’ve never seen her lose any argument she’s in, even in the ones I know she’s wrong about, she’s just that good about being a deceiving asshole. (Sorry, I know I shouldn’t talk about my mom that way, but it’s true.) You will not win with that woman. Which is actually why I do not argue with her, because suddenly entering the zone with her, my facts and anything I‘ve told her is suddenly “untrue” and I’m just lying to her, fine my wonderful mother, you win. But wait! Don’t tell her you’re wrong and admit defeat, cause then she’ll get even more pissed off for whatever reason even though you’re LITERALLY submitting to her.

She’s also very good at masking her feelings, which then makes you just feel bad for her.

2. My stepfather can’t take criticism, advice, is extremely over dramatic, and quite a hoarder. Which SUCKS, because he’s such a nice person too, but he as well knows he‘s a nice person, which makes him think that by being a good person, it’s an excuse to leave his shit all over the house, for me to clean up after, and I can’t ever confront him about any problem I have, because not even five minutes later, it goes straight to my mom, even if it was something small like asking him to just put his shoes away. You also can’t tell that guy secrets, because by the end of day, five other people you didn’t even want to tell, know. This happened when I came out about my “self destructive” behavior to put it short, oh how was I pissed.

3. You’ve heard me say it before! My stepsister is a complete brat, and doesn’t even know how to use the fucking shower settings at eleven years old. She still throws tantrums over the smallest shit ever, is so incredibly needy and thinks everything revolves around her. You could imagine my surprise when she still calls her parents “mama” or “dada“, or doesn’t want to throw a piece of trash away herself. She’s also very judge mental of other girls, about the way they look, weight, eat, or dress, how incredibly disgusting.

4. I’m a piece of shit too! I literally hate my stepfather and stepsister, and want nothing to do with them, I purposely have an attitude towards them, and try my absolute best to avoid them, I try to make it very clear without saying anything that being in their presence is absolutely draining.

ALRIGHT, HERE’S WHERE I ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH START

We, us four, were able to finally get our own home, in an okay neighborhood, we lived comfortably, and my stepsister was actually able to make friends with a girl down the street after two years of living there, great! Out the house more often she goes!

I never liked those neighbors from the start though, they just weirded me out, I didn’t actually have a reason to not like them, I just didn’t, my mom didn’t mind though, she said I was able to like and dislike whoever I wanted, but that didn’t mean they wouldn’t stop hanging around us.

The family consisted of the little girl my stepsister was friends with, her mom, who was single. And her sister (who was surprisingly neighbors as well) with her husband and daughter, who I think is in her mid twenties.

I hated the sister the most, which funnily enough is the one who my stepdad cheated with, but she was just so weird. You could tell her relationship with her husband was failing, they didn’t try to mask it either, everyone knew. He was obsessed with her, still is, and pretty much controls what that woman does.

And I think that’s exactly why she and my stepdad got together in the first place.

My parents relationship was just going downhill, we were all a family by law, yeah, but I don’t think any of us were actually comfortable with each other. I hated my stepsister, my MOM hated my stepsister, me and my stepdad were always hesitant with each other now that I was growing up and starting to see his flaws, and my mom always argued with him because of his kid.

Me and my stepdads relationship wasn’t improving either, it was just going downhill, and I hated being near him, cause I just associated him with all of the messy shit he leaves behind, and doesn’t know how to do anything around the house.

It sucks to say this, but I knew after a while after moving into the house the relationship wouldn’t last, and I’m surprised my stepdad put up with us for so long, because we’re terrible. How much do you have to seriously love someone to stay with them, knowing that they hate your kid? It’s just unreal.

So, yeah, two unhealthy relationships, I get why he did it in a way, but I’m still..upset? happy? I just don’t know, it’s so strange.

We found out last Sunday, the husband ended up finding their texts, and showing my mom, it was so quick. Me and my mom were just browsing at Target, drinking coffee, till she was arguing in the next aisle over the phone.

She refused to tell me at first, just asking me giant questions on like how ‘If we needed to move, would you be upset?” And whatnot.

But after an hour she just came clean with me, my stepdad had been cheating on her with the wife next door for about two months, yeah only two months, but there shouldn‘t have been any months two begin with.

All I could say was “Oh.”

So, the drive back home was pretty silent, she waited for him to get back home so they could talk, which my stepdad really tried to avoid, but my mom was READY to talk.

After their conversation, she sat down next to me in bed, she found out it had been going on for those two months, they met up on multiple records, and my step-dad planned to never tell her about it.

So, after my mom heard that part, she decided she would no longer have a part in their marriage, and that they would be getting a divorce. Which I mean, I expected, just not like this. I expected them to hold out until I finished school, not them splitting over my stepdad having an affair. It just felt so unreal in the moment, it even feels unreal thinking about it now. My stepdad is such an amazing dude despite his flaws, and loves my mom (somehow), how could he just do that? Even though, I really get why he did as well, my mother is a draining person.

She started crying next to me, which is the only reason why I cried throughout that entire event, even in the hardest times of our lives, I’ve never seen her cry until that moment, she’s extremely strong and just seeing that did something to me. Seeing how six years of her life was wasted in this piece of ass state and marriage over some women that we hadn’t even known, that she hadn’t even known for eight months. I was enraged.

But even though I was so incredibly angry, I was unfortunately, so, So, SO happy in that moment, because me and my mom were finally leaving to go back home, leaving the two others behind. Something I’ve been wanting just for way longer than I’ll ever admit to anybody in my family. I would never have to live with something so gross again, even though I would argue that I am equally as gross, for hoping for a divorce on my mom’s seemingly “happy” marriage, and leaving my stepfather.

He knew he screwed up too, he was shocked when my mom was instant about their divorce, she had already gone through something like this before. She was insistent, selling our house, taking the dogs, and most importantly, leaving at the end of my school semester in June. I didn’t see much, but I heard the conversation, he cried, and just kept insisting that he fucked up, badly.

That night was the worst, I think I’ll always remember it too, it wasn’t even rough, I was just in the kitchen making dinner for myself, and he just asked me two questions.

“Are you upset?” Which I responded “Kinda”.

“Are you mad at me?” I just said “A little.” and left, truth is, I wanted to say so much more, of course I’m angry at you, you threw away six years of marriage just like that, and still insist on doing the most for her now that you’re going to lose her? You made my mom cry, you went and SCREWED OFF with someone you didn’t even know for a whole year. And yet, I wanted to say I was so happy for him fucking up, because now we could finally leave, which is something I knew my mom always wanted to do, she had wasted her years here unhappily, and she could just finally leave, and so could I.

This all happened last Sunday might I say again if I haven’t already, it’s all going by very fast, my house is almost empty, except for the dining room table, couch, and TV, everything is already packed in bags and boxes, mainly my moms belongings, nobody is saying it, but I genuinely think that even though she was upset about the divorce, I think she’s glad she has a reason to finally leave, because I’ve never seen someone so giddy packing boxes.

My stepdad is trying so hard too now, now that he knows he’s losing 3/4ths of his life. Constantly telling my mom how much he loves her, cooking her dinner, trying to indulge in conversations with me, and being very over the top with what he does. It’s almost painful to watch, since it’s just all in desperate attempts. He’s practically willing to spend so much money and time with me now, but I didn’t even like doing that before, so I just try to avoid him even more now.

Which is unfortunately, impossible. My parents are still on okay terms with each other, which is nice I suppose, but I still feel anger towards my stepfather, which is icky, considering the fact that we’re going to Vegas in the morning to celebrate for my birthday, and he has to come along with. I know it’s a shitty thing to think, considering the fact that this will be his last time spending a birthday with me. But by the end of this post, I’m sure any reader can make up that this entire family is shitty, we’re all pieces of shit in our own ways. 

But, that’s really it off my chest. If any of you actually bothered to read my nonsense blabbering, thank you for staying till the end. Just knowing someone just sat here and “listened” to me is enough.

I moved here from the US a year ago, thinking I’d be living in some magical European utopia filled with bikes, cheese, and charming canals. And while yes, there are canals… that’s basically where the fairytale ends.

First off, the customer service here is _non-existent_. You ask for something in a store and the clerk looks at you like you’re the inconvenience. In America, someone would be offering to gift-wrap it, upsell you a matching item, and throw in a smile for free. Over here, I feel like I’m personally ruining someone’s day every time I try to buy a coffee.

Also—WHY IS EVERYTHING CLOSED AT 6PM?! What am I supposed to do if I suddenly remember I need groceries or want to shop after work? In the US, I could be at a Target at _2am_ buying throw pillows and frozen pizza if I felt like it. Here, if you miss that sacred 6pm window, good luck surviving until tomorrow.

Let’s talk about food. Why does everything taste like it’s been filtered through a blandness machine? Where are the spices? The flavor? The concept of seasoning?? Don’t even get me started on how Dutch people think putting sprinkles on bread is a breakfast.

And I’m sorry, but biking in the rain every day is not “part of the charm.” It’s wet, cold, and terrifying. I miss my car. I miss _heated seats_. I miss drive-thrus. I miss the simple freedom of going anywhere without arriving windblown and soggy.

The Dutch love to say how “direct” they are, but let’s call it what it is: rude. Blunt to the point of social violence. In the US, we sugarcoat things for a reason—it’s called basic _human decency_.

I came here expecting tulips and tolerance. What I got was bureaucracy, mayo on fries, and a national obsession with bread + cheese. Honestly, at this point I’d trade all the stroopwafels in the world for a Chick-fil-A and someone who says “have a nice day” and _means it_.

I (M32) got broken up with (F30) during a very tough time

We met via Hinge, both of us wanted long term (marriage) and started dating

We live just a few blocks away, so we used to meet everyday and connected very well. Of course there were teething issues, and we had to work on a few things, but we were going with it

Come March, I injured my knee and had to walk around in a cast. She too was going through health issues. I got a surgery done eventually for my Knee. She was there for me through it and I'm grateful. Her mother was also very supportive and even spent the night at hospital, looking after me.

Both our families knew too.

My family however created a nuisance as they couldn't be there due to an out of trip business work. They made my life hell as they were upset about her mother staying over. Obviously my partner was witness to all of this and she was getting annoyed. I got discharged from the hospital. My partner came for the discharge. I told her not to act up but she passed a taunt and left and my family's anger just got worse.

I fought for my partner. I even left the house and went to a hotel to stay. They started messaging and calling her. I told her to block them. Later on that night, she broke up with me saying I need to get my life together and then I should offer to share it with her.

She wanted me to get therapy, and do a few things, which I began doing.

The next few days, I took a stand for my partner at home and restricted my family about interfering. They realized, felt guilty, understood their mistake, Apologized to her via text. They even offered to meet and sort out the misunderstanding but she wasn't having any of it.

After the breakup, I went NC for a few days. We then spoke and she was to return home after 2 days as she was out on a business trip. In the interim, I met her family and apologized. They expressed their doubts about my family, I ensured them it was a one time thing and they were cool with it

She came back, called me herself, met me for coffee. We met again for a drive. Things were getting better. Point to note - She was absolutely normal with me when we met, she hugged me, was holding my hand, behaving normal

When I was dropping her off the last time, she said she doesn't feel for me anymore. She cares and all of that but doesn't have romantic feelings and it's wrong to be speaking to me. She said maybe her part in my life was only till here.

I feel blindsided, cause I really gave it all and I love her and still want her back.

Point to note - Before my surgery, I told her categorically that please allow me 10-15 days to get my health in order. Let's not fight or take any rash decision and just let things normalize. I told her I would be needy but I'll be okay by the 31st of March. Yet during this time only, she broke up.

I really tried a lot and I'd do anything for her

Please suggest, what do I do. 

It feels like a very immature breakup and I don’t think she can lose feelings in a matter of 8-10 days, considering how close we were.

Been no contact since 3 days now.

Ever feel like your to-do list has more things on it than a CVS receipt, and yet, your day somehow only has 24 hours? Yeah, I’ve been there. But what if I told you I’ve found a way to save **10 hours** a week? 🚀

Spoiler alert: It's not about becoming a morning person, so night owls, you're safe!

So let’s talk **Time Blocking vs. Energy Peaks**. I've tried every productivity hack under the sun (trust me, I've been on those ""inspirational"" 4am wake-up YouTube rabbit holes more times than I can count), and here's what finally clicked:

**1. Not Everyone's a Morning Person:**
   - Turns out I'm the worst version of myself before 10am. Forcing productivity in the AM? Painful. If you like your coffee with a side of grumpiness, you know what I mean.

**2. Identify Your Energy Peaks:**
   - I realized I’m a solid post-lunch powerhouse. Between noon and 3pm, I'm basically a task-shredding machine. Recognize those golden hours where you feel invincible and plan your toughest tasks then.

**3. Time Blocking is a Game Changer:**
   - I used to block time on my calendar like a neurotic Tetris player, never considering my energy levels. Now? I align my blocks with energy peaks instead. Goodbye, afternoon slumps!

**4. Skip the Mornings for Deep Work:**
   - Mornings are for emails and easy tasks that require minimal brainpower. Save your epic brainstorming and creative tasks for when your energy is at its finest.

**5. It’s Okay to Flex:**
   - Some days, life laughs at your plans, and that’s cool. Adjusting your schedule doesn’t mean failure—it means flexibility, and that’s a superpower too. 💪

Oh, and let’s not forget, downtime is vital. *Anyone else watch Netflix as if it’s cardio?*

Figuring this out wasn’t just an epiphany—it felt like finding the secret level in a video game where everything just *works*. It’s not perfect, but it's miles ahead of where I was.

So, how do you guys schedule your day? Ever tried syncing up with your own natural energy highs and lows? Share your wisdom or hit that upvote if you’re just nodding along. Can't wait to see what strategies you all have. ✨",1,1743498232.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

“Master”, it gurgles from its awful, malformed gullet, “the Underlords, they summons us!” The goblin-thing holds out a scabby hand. Clutched within a [rotting roll of parchment](https://steamcommunity.com/app/230190/discussions/0/4842022494096060431/?snr=2___), marked with an incomprehensible repeating message of “+1”, repeated again and again by different voices, overlapping in cacophonic disorder – perhaps in some sinister, evil ritual that causes a monkey paw to curl somewhere.  
  
Well, your demands have been heeded Underlords; after a brief foray into [SPACE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/494730/Galacticare/?snr=2___), our next game in the War for the Overworld franchise is just around the proverbial dungeon corner – and in a form you might not expect.

We’re proud to finally introduce WORLD OF THE WAR FOR THE OVERWORLD: ONLINE! That’s right Underlord, we’re making the next logical leap for a real-time strategy game, the inevitable, inexorable march towards the MMORPG genre!

Team up with your fellow Underlords in a massively multiplayer role playing experience. Loot and pillage the vast caves of forgotten ruins, face deadly foes and answer the quests of dungeon delvers and denizens.

At least, that’s what our marketing analytics say.

# HARD Mode - A New Way to Play

We’ve been watching developments in the MMO space closely these last few years – and especially the rise of “Hardcore” experiences. We want to take the tension, the pressure, and the immersion even further!  
  
So we’re introducing Hardcore Absolutely Real Death Mode or HARD Mode. For the low price of £2,100 a month (and a signed waiver by you) our in-house specialist, Geoff, will come to live with you with the explicit goal of linking your fate to your characters.  
  
If you eat in the game, Geoff force feeds you coffee biscuits. Get stabbed by a goblin? Geoff cuts you with an actual knife. Fall off a cliff? Geoff breaks your legs. Die in the game? Geoff snaps your neck like a carrot!  
  
Better yet, while playing HARD Mode, your character never truly logs out, so the peril never stops! Find a safe space for your character, eat when they do, sleep when they do. Geoff is always there, all seeing, all knowing. Geoff is there for your immersion. Trust Geoff.

# We’ve Got What You Need!

**\*Producer’s Note: FOR INTERNAL REVIEW ONLY DO NOT INCLUDE IN PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT!!!\***  
  
There’s a bunch of awesome ways we can monetise this shit on top of the subscription and make some EZ DOSH. People will buy anything these days y’know? Suckers. Anyway if you figure out a way to make this fit into the announcement in a way that gets people hyped it’s here for you. **JUST MAKE SURE IT’S NEVER SEEN!**

* **Mounts!** \- You seen those suckers paying £50 for a goddamn horse these days? That’s more than the whole game! Get in! While you’re at it, throw some VFX on it in an afternoon, and we can probably make a premium version cost a bit more. Cha-ching baby! 
* **Convenience!** \- Everyone’s getting older and busier plus, we’ve harnessed the power of dark design to make it so everything just feels a bit more like a slog, but you can never put your finger on why. That’s great because it means we can sell people stuff like character boosts, reputation boosters or other useful consumables so they don’t have to play the game or talk to anyone. Win-win I’d say! 
* **Seasons, Seasons, Seasons!** \- You gotta keep people playing man! No matter what the cost, have an arbitrary system that hands out piecemeal rewards which we’d have previously given out in bigger batches. We can get more playtime out of the same work on our part, and more playtime means more sunk cost! Keep them in the net like the minnows they are! 
* **In-Game Money** \- Goldsellers are a plague – getting all that fake money in our game, and making real money by selling it to people. But I’ve got a great idea – instead of banning these suckers and their customers as the cheats they are, we can just become gold sellers ourselves. Just abstract it out to give the option to get game time for in-game money and vice versa, then bob’s your uncle – we’ll outcompete the gold sellers AND make a tidy profit. What’s that? Concerned about the integrity of the game economy? Truly don’t give a toss. 
* **Geoff Customisations** \- Geoff has insisted, as part of his contract, he gets all sorts of “swish human cloth” sent to him. Listen, I don’t want to fuck with this guy – he scares me, and if we don’t do it he might eat my appendix. Let’s just add a bunch of micro transactions and call them customisation for the player’s personal Geoff. As long as it keeps him busy, we’re good. Just get it done, for Christ's sakes. 
* **The Billionaire Special!** \- Why stop at letting people buy gold and levels? For our biggest whales, let’s offer a service where some cheap labour plays the game for them, getting them the best gear while they sleep; all so our most venerable whales can feel a sense of true accomplishment and “earn” the admiration and respect that their joyless, empty, money golem heart truly desires. Just make sure it’s not too obvious. We don’t want people upsetting our biggest cash cows by rightfully claiming they’re frauds, or something. 

  
That’s just a few of the things, I’ve got more of these than I can shake a stick at. Let’s book a powwow on Thursday to go over it! Thanks! **- CFO**

I asked her, “Can I go on the computer and spend some time with my friend?” She said, “Yeah, that’s okay.” I stayed a bit longer watching TV with her while waiting for my friend. I told her, “I really like that we’ve been spending a lot of time together. It’s fun, and I feel warm and happy! We have jokes that only we understand. What do you think?” She stayed silent.

Then I went to the computer and spent about an hour and 35 minutes there. After that, she started talking to me in a sarcastic way, saying, “So, are you happy now? Did you have a good time on the computer? I hope you’re satisfied with yourself… your priorities are in order, right?” I asked why she was talking like that because I had asked for permission beforehand. Then I just went to bed.

In the morning, when I woke up and went downstairs to make food, she asked, “What’s wrong with you now?” I told her, “You treated me badly yesterday.” She went silent.

Then her child (not mine, but from her previous relationship) wanted some grapes. I said, “Okay, of course,” and went to the store to buy them. I continued making breakfast—sandwiches, coffee, and cutting up an orange. Then she came in and immediately took the grapes to give them to her child. I asked, “Could you please wait? I thought I’d put everything on the table at the same time so the child has options.” She responded sarcastically, “Oh, YOU thought, huh?” Then she gave the grapes to the child anyway, and after that, the child only ate grapes and nothing else.

I told her that kind of behavior wasn’t okay. I also mentioned that she had given me permission to go on the computer but later changed her mind. Then she claimed that I had told her, “We already spend so much time together, so I can go on the computer,” but those were not my words at all.

After that, I dropped the knife I had used to spread butter into the sink and said, “This is not okay… You don’t treat someone like this.” Because I let go of the knife, suddenly I was the crazy one? That’s not how you talk to me…

Then she started saying that I had ruined her evening because, according to her, I had said, “We already spend so much time together, so it’s okay if I go on the computer.” But I never said that—I had simply asked her if it was okay for me to go.

I asked her, “Why are you talking to me like this? You don’t appreciate me at all… I pay the mortgage, all the bills, do the grocery shopping, take the kids to school and pick them up, make breakfast and dinner.

To which she replied, “What, you think you deserve respect? You’re not a man, you’re a sled dog (kelgunoor), and a sled dog gets talked to like this. You haven’t earned my respect.”

On top of that, she hasn’t slept in the same bed with me for four days now. I asked her why that is, and she said she doesn’t want to sleep in the same bed as me. I told her that it really hurts that she doesn’t want to sleep next to me. But she denied ever saying that.

I also asked her not to talk to me like this, not to twist my words, and not to accuse me of things I haven’t said. I told her that she’s putting me in a situation where I have to defend myself against things I never even did. “Why do you do this? You make me doubt my own words…”

And she just answered, “You have memory problems.”

Asked her again, can you please tell me why are you telling me my words in a different way and tell me that i have memory problems? Are you doing it on purpose? She sat in silent and started to record me with her phone when i asked her again.",1,1743498039.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

Forgot all about that show then watched another show and remember thinking about an actress in a more side roll and thinking OMG. She's beautiful!. Rewatched the first show again and remembered how gorgeous she was. Had to look up her name this time, and discovered that the woman from the first and second show are actually one and the same. I decided to look at her socially media and she's surprisingly pretty even without make-up. Sh'es not actually very involved in acting, more in to nomading and  studying, acting is just some kind of hobby apparently.

I work for a fashion company, long story short I managed to strike up some banter with her through her social media DMs and told her I think she would be a great model for a new product line at our company. She's from NZ and Luckily for me she travels to London frequently cause she's got friends and family her. And i'm trying to meet up with her for a coffee at some point so we can discuss the shoot and maybe have some bants on the side. I was wondering at what point I should draw the line here though so i'm not crossing in to to 'cheater' territory with my girlfriend of 2.5 years

To be honest with you, i've got no intention of cheating, i'm just most impressed by the fact that few years, i'm watching this show on netflix thinking, bleh that actress is a world away and is way out of my league, and now I find I might be going for a coffee with her.

Yesterday, my husband, sister in law, my husband's two cousins, myself and my daughter went to a cafe for coffee. The cafe had board games on each table so we played. We first played a game of sequence, then uno and scrabble. We were there for maybe 1.5 or 2 hours. My daughter was playing with the board game stuff, or eating her snacks that we laid out or climbing on us or the sofa etc. We were actually enjoying playing games after a long time and I realised I was feeling guilty that my daughter was playing on her own. Like I felt bad for her and I felt like she's being such a nice child by playing on her own and I'm playing for myself instead of playing with her. Of course eventually she was getting tired and got fussy but that's totally okay.

Also due to my ill health for such long period , I gained weight and eventually also started struggling mentally , almost 4 years I've spent thinking that's it , today is the day I'll end myself but I pulled through  , I had friends but we were what 14-15 years old and no other 14-15 year old felt what i felt , also my friends turned to bullies and shit happened , finally I switched schools , made great friends and started improving for myself , felt happy but again started with alcohol and coffee and became addicted and didn't sleep at all , I went downhill again , then started realising after 1.5 years of this that wtf am I even doing , so started working out , became healthy , stopped everything , due to stress of exams and college applications this year , i started gaining weight , now back to losing it and healthier meals and habits , BASICALLY ALL IN ALL MY LIFE IS LIKE A CIRCLE , A NEVER ENDING ONE , still thanks to my family and closest friends , I have turned out to be a good person , hardly aggressive ,  very humble , down to earth and also practice gratitude everyday but deep down i feel like i might be a burden to people hence i don't talk to em' , especially not about what I feel or think , If i do it comes out in flow 

But the current situation is after grandma's passing away a few of my closest friends have distanced themselves because they don't know what to say and are pretending that nothing happened , same with one my close cousin, she is acting like nothing changed and I'm confused, I am a tough kid but maybe I'm overreacting to the fact that I've lost a person ??? I don't know , at this point just to keep the peace i started talking to them again , less interactive but acting like i'm fucking great and as far as it goes for my cousin , she and I talked it out and she acknowledged my feeling but made no effort to mend it or reach out to me , so I want someone else's opinion , AITAH for wanting attention and just wanting my feelings to be acknowledged ?? 

  
ps- I'll be going going for therapy after college is finalised because right now i'm already dealing with alot , moreover my routine has definitely ,made me disciplined but i feel so fucking tired and drained out , I sleep at 12:30 - 1:00 am and wake up by 5 - 5:15 am  ",1,1743497789.0,AITAH,1,0.6,False

Back with another D&D related hobby voice actor search. First and foremost, if you've messaged me before and haven't gotten a reply, please don't be shy, there were a lot of applicants last time. 

This is a super small one, however. I need about 5 actors, each voicing a single line, and I just want it to be as dramatic as possible. 

I plan to stitch together these clips in rapid succession and offer my D&D players a sort of ""next season/episode preview"" that you see at the end of anime sometimes.

It's all in good fun and I'm confident they'll love it. 

My budget is about 15 USD for the whole batch, so about 3 USD per person. Given that they're 1 short line each, I imagine that's perfectly fine for those who are looking for a super duper quick coffee.

I apologise for those insulted by the price if at all, this is a low budget hobby for me, and purely a fun thing I wanna do for my players.

Feel free to DM me or reply here.

I eat extremely clean, try to only drink water, and limit alcohol to 1-2 times a month. Quit vaping this week for zyn.

March 10-21 / 2025: Experiencing abdominal feeling (extremely dull) on the lower right side and varicocele swelling that caused pain Swelling and pain subsided, but abdominal feeling persisted. Saw primary care doctor and ordered BMP. Slightly elevated lipase that indicated pancreatitis.

March 22/ 2025 Right side abdominal feeling/ beginning to ache. Left side abdominal pain/pressure. Arrived home from work experiencing an “off” feeling for the lack of a better term; throughout my body and chest including pain in my heart/leftarm and palpitations around 6P which caused me to leave my apartment gym after 1 set of curls. I was watching Better Call Saul while eating a pint of ice cream around 11P when i went to use the bathroom. Immediately upon standing up, I had a weird light-headed feeling that wasn’t a normal “standing up too fast” feeling. I walked to the bathroom and felt like I was going to die so i immediately started looking for my phone. Last thing I remember was peeing and the thought of finding my phone before I woke up on my bathroom floor profusely sweating, with my cat on my lap. I got up in a panic and found my phone when i called my brother to take me to urgent care. I looked in the mirror and my left rip was purple, upper right back was scratched and bleeding, and my head was throbbing back/top right. I got to urgent care and had a strange feeling in my entire body especially my abdomen. After an abdomen/renal ct scan with contrast, there was nothing to be found. The doctor did blood work: Low anion gap Low platelet High RDW SD Normal Platelet Negative Abdominal Ct Negative Chest X-ray 
Blood pressure slightly elevated.

Diagnosis: Dehydration…. Referred to primary care.

March 23-31/ 2025 Abdominal pressure has persisted on both sides after shifting to completely organic diet and staying hydrated.

Attempting to get back into gym with pre workout and supplements. Lifts are actually not bad but sometimes my heart will absolutely pound causing me to take long breaks. I still have a constant weird feeling in my lower right abdomen and chest/neck/arm pains that come and go. I get very anxious thinking about it. I saw a cardiologist and i’m picking up my heart right monitor April 1. ECG and stress test later in the week.

1joqtyr,https://i.redd.it/uaf15fwer6se1.png,Kilian Black Phantom- Memento Mori- (The Cellars collection),"
Perfume connoisseurs undoubtedly have heard about this fragrances at one point or the other due to the hype this fragrances created in social media platforms. 

Black phantom is part of the Cellars collection from Kilian Hennesy. I had visited Maison des Parfums in Jio world drive and had a chance to try out various kilian fragrances. Black phantom immediately caught my attention. The fragrance is categorised as a gourmand. 

Incidentally gourmands are one of my least favourite categories in perfumery. The notion of smelling edible is beyond my understanding or style. The moment I had sprayed it and had a sniff I was floored. The note of Rum with a combination of coffee and chocolate had elevated it beyond a juvenile feeling of smelling like a cookie or cake. 

This is one gourmand which a mature gentleman can easily pull off. 

The fragrance is linear and doesn't change much from start to finish. The key notes mentioned in the Kilian website are Rum, coffee, chocolate and cyanide. 

The note of cyanide I believe is the note akin to bitter almonds and it does smell that way. 

The fragrance is a combination of slightly boozy airy rum, with a bitterness of chocolate and slightly sweet dusty cocoa rounded off with a note of sugar. 

The fragrance in its dry down is slightly powdery due to heliotrope and a creaminess of sandalwood lingers at the end bringing off a delectable finish. 

It is not cloyingly sweet by any means, the bitterness of toasted coffee and dusty cocoa with sweetness of sugar and airy rum is a beautiful combination and will surely turn heads. 

Performance is good with a noticeable scent bubble for about 7 hours and stays close to skin for 10 hours. 

It is much suited for evening wear for parties, dates or special occasions. Would suit even better on an all black attire or satin based clothing. 

Overall i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes boozy fragrances and no one does it better than Kilian. 

And as the tag line says ""Memento Mori- Remember you must die"". And so I add..
Why don't we enjoy while we last...

An undoubtedly rich, boozy, decadent and luxurious fragrance.",3,1743496900.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

How do I deal with my bi polar mom in this situation?,"I F 22 am moving out of my house to live with my boyfriend because I can’t stand living in a constant state of stress anymore. TW: neglect, emotional abuse?

Context:
Here’s the sob story but to give you an idea of what she’s like. Growing up I was emotionally neglected as a child because my younger sibling was born with a medical condition that required he have more attention. I went from being an only child to non existent practically and expected to raise him and keep him from getting into trouble at the age of 6 and up. My mom used to yell at me a lot and go off on me for little things all the time. If I accidentally spilled something, if the coffee machine didn’t work. 

It was my fault. My feelings have always felt they didn’t matter and I have always been asked by my father to put my feelings aside for my mother. If I was upset with her and would cry she would cry and then I would comfort her. There were a lot of times she would cry and I would be comforting her I felt like I was raising my mom. She’s also said a lot of nasty things to me in the past but then will deny saying them and claim she would never say something like that 

For example: when I got diagnosed with autism (as an adult) she told me one morning “you know I thought when you were having issues with friends they were the problem but now I think you were the problem”. 

Also when they got me a car I make payments on and I moved out the first time my dad told me “we got you the car so you could take your brother to school in the morning so your mom didn’t have to not so you could move out”.  

I’m moving out again and this time with my boyfriend and I know she is going to have a meltdown. My dad has even said so. 

What is the best way I can deal with this and navigate the conversation with her? I stress a lot about her saying hurtful things. I think she’s going to argue about us not being married they’re religious I’m not. And argue with me that I’m choosing him over my family. 

I also think she’s going to escalate escalate escalate. And advice is really appreciated. ",1,1743495846.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Here is the second short section featuring the savages Chloe has. This is the morning after our lass Pellagro wakes up.

\------

Tech, are you ready?” Chloe asked. 

The man loomed over an array of blinking drones he had set up atop one of the dining room tables in the black site compound. 

Chloe was aware of the devices' purpose but had no concept of how they legitimately worked despite having seen them used a dozen times. Through a mix of multispectral readings—thermal, auditory, pheromonal, and more she couldn’t name—the array was essentially the most accurate recording device and lie detector for multispecies use. 

“Just about; I only need another moment,” Tech chirped, strapping a set of goggles over his eyes, the straps digging into his bald head. 

Inside that cupping headset, a dozen screens flickered to life, each displaying different readings from the devices. To a normal person, the sheer amount of visual stimulation would be overwhelming to the point of sickness, but for Tech, it was just another day in the office. 

Each drone hummed to life and floated high in the small room, spreading around it. Their cameras and sensors scoured the room, watching each molecule keenly like the all-seeing eye of god. 

“We are good to go,” Tech said, leaning back in his chair. 

“Perfect,” Chloe said.

Chloe tapped her datapad and sent a message to Blondie, telling him it was time to escort their guest here and for them all to eat. Along with discussing the potential future of Doctor Pellagro 

—-

Pellagro rolled around in the bed Mouse had given her the previous night, adjusting the clothes he had also provided. 

They looked like nothing she would typically wear, but they were better than the filth-covered clothes she had stripped out of before her rejuvenating shower the previous night. 

She was wearing shorts that barely concealed her plump rump and a T-shirt so large it might as well have been a dress. The depiction of the Aviex pop star Arenli wearing a tight one-piece looked good, showing the fit pop star singing proudly to a crowd of millions. 

Arenli's music might as well have been the theme song of Pellagros's college life. She could recall many a late study night when her music blasting was the only thing keeping her awake. 

She grabbed the collar of the shirt dress and  inhaled deeply. The oversized garb smelled like fire—heady, full-bodied, and relentless—yet it made her feel safe and secure, not as if she was about to be harmed. 

That scent had given her the best night's rest in years despite the circumstances that led her to be here. 

She hated Mouse on an intellectual level and knew she should want nothing to do with the man, but after wearing his shirt like a dress and being forced to smell his heady musk, she almost forgave him for the torment she was subjected to.

She was unsure if it was because she was a female with a silly set of instincts that flowed heavily in the veins of all the Aviex women or because each time his muscle flexed, her mouth watered, dreaming of drinking his luscious blood.  

She smelled it deeply, moaning while his intoxicating scent accosted her senses, letting her dream of that man of men atop her. She laid back in the bed, holding onto his shirt like it was a drug someone was about to take away. 

She clutched the shirt like a fix, soaking in his scent as if it were a drug, her body flushing with anticipation for his presence. A thought she never could have fathomed before last night. 

Pellagro consciously screamed in her mind. WHY, WHY, WHY!

He had tortured her for days on end, demanded her to speak, and pressed her mind, body, and soul to all limits of survivability. All While he serenaded her with his inability to hold a tune. 

Yet the moment he held her close, carried her gently, and spent almost three hours apologizing for all he had done, saying it was all part of the job, tending her wounds, and treating her like the center of the world—she melted. 

Pellagro had never been attended to like that. He treated her like a princess, like a woman who was worth more than the money she earned or the fact that she had some status as a rare species. 

To Mouse, she was just her, Pellagro, not a doctor or a spy. To him, she was just a wounded woman who needed aid. And him, a beef steak of a man brimming with ichor, held her like a Faberge egg for hours.  

For fucks sake, she almost grabbed him as she laid her to bed. She wanted to pull him close and demand he give her more.  

But that idea was stupid and made no sense, and she could not help but find him caustically attractive.

She wanted Mouse to hold her, caress her hips, and kiss at her neck, and dare she think, Mordain; an act so intimate only Aviex should do. 

But she had to put on hold her ponderance of the discord assaulting her mind, body, and soul without delay. A more critical matter entered the room and raised a brow at her, smelling the borrowed clothes. 

“Uh, do you want some more alone time with that shirt?” Blondie chuckled, leaning against the door frame. 

Pellagro froze for several seconds, feeling like a kid who had just been caught stealing from the cookie jar. Once her mind had caught up with reality, she erupted from the bed, tossing the blankets away. 

“Absolutely not,” Pellagro tried to yell but only managed a whimpering squeak. 

The Human laughed at her failed defiance, which only caused her cheeks to flush from a girlish pink to a red so deep she might as well have been bleeding from her pores. 

“Alright then,” Blondie smirked, waving for her to follow. “Come on, it’s time for breakfast.” 

Trying not to give him more ammunition for ridicule, Pellargo made no fuss and followed Blondie through the small barracks building and out into the compound's yard. She winced as the bright light of the twin stars assaulted her four red eyes. She groaned and wiped at them as they walked, letting the compound's exterior come into focus. 

Pellargo suppressed a shudder as the remnants of where the cages had been came into view. Dozens of evenly spaced divots in the snow spread from one end of the yard to another, all other traces of the torture site's existence having been whisked away by the team in the middle of the night. Carried away like leaves in the wind by their unseen, spectral efforts. 

“So what do you mean breakfast?"" Pellargro asked, curious about why, after three days, they were going to feed her—but also, in the back of her mind, not believing this would just be a simple meal. 

“Breakfast, you know, breaking your fast? It's the most important meal of the day. I don't understand what you don't get about us going to go eat,” Blondie said without breaking stride. “Like, we are different species, but Axiex still eat in the mornings.”

“I know what breakfast is. I just— just why are you giving me food?” Pellagro sighed, unable to wrap her head around the Human's odd mannerisms and how, despite all she knew about the man–which wasn’t much he was going against every prediction she had. 

As far as she knew, Blondie was a torturer, a menace, a spy, and a soldier. Yet he was talking with her as casually as a friend would, to the point that he teased her.

Pellagro assumed she’d remain locked up in that room; he and maybe that woman she had seen would come by, interrogate her without physical torture, then take her to whatever quiet corner of the universe the other Aviex prisoners were taken, and then be killed---she had accepted that it all was over. 

The Aviex government would certainly kill her if. It only made sense for Humans to be the same, a thought that only made more sense after she had learned the two meetings were as rare as Astatine. 

Blondie paused at the door to the secondary building he had led her toward, resting his palm on the door while sighing. He turned about and stood tall. Pellagro shuddered, seeing the shift in the man's vibrant blue eyes. 

All semblance of joviality and familiarity had left them in an instant. She was not looking at the man who had cracked a joke at her a few minutes earlier. No, this was the same man who had abducted her, killed multiple Aviex agents, and did not bat an eye at her torment. 

Pellagro had thought she knew what staring into the eyes of a monster felt like. In her long tenure as a doctor, she had treated plenty of battle-hardened men, psychopaths, and the downright dredges of the universe, the type of men who would stab you and let you bleed out without a second thought if you crossed them. 

But the sheer calmness of Blondie's eyes was something else. It was like looking into the endless void-blue of the ocean. He cared so little about your life; If you were not careful, you would never be found again—or worse, they would be finding you for years and still be missing pieces. 

“Alright, hot stuff, I am going to lay down the law with you right quick. I do not care how the Aviex government treated you or what they asked of you—for now. Nor do I want to repeat myself.” Blondie said, jabbing a calloused trigger finger into her tit. 

“Here,” he preached, pointing at the ground. We eat three meals a day, treat our friends well, and all pull our weight.” 

“But I was your enemy. I was trying to take Lysa away from here. How can you treat me like a friend?” Pellagro meekly argued. 

“An enemy? Your enemy?” Blondie asked, voice calm as still water, stepping closer, his broad, muscled chest bumping into hers while he held his arms open wide. “If you really want me to be your enemy, go ahead and attack me. I will even give you the first hit. But before you do understand this, I don't think of you as an enemy.” 

Pellagro tried to take a step back, but Blondie kept her chest to her chest as if he were demanding she draw a line in the sand. Enemy or ally, there was no room for discussion about the matter; she had to choose then and there---or face the man he truly was without a filter.  

“We might have been on opposite sides of this whole mess, but that did not make you an enemy. We just had some dirty business dealings in the past,” Blondie smirked. 

She swallowed her spit, pondering exactly what he was saying. She could understand the rough idea of what he meant by ""it was just business."" She did not hate the patients who did not follow her instructions, nor did she despise those who simply never came in for treatment until it was too late to aid them. Those were just part and parcel of what she did as a doctor. 

Knowing that she surrendered to the idea that Blondie was being genuine with her, she stood as tall as possible despite being half a head lower than the towering Human. She was still a proud member of the Aveix race, a species that used to cause the galaxy to quake in fear. 

Just like her ancestors would not bow to the wants and intimidation attempts of the GU, she would not openly submit to anyone—not even the Human. 

“That is just a stupid idea. I can’t fight you. You would just beat me within an inch of my life again,” Pellagro huffed, putting up a front of strength. 

“Glad we can understand each other,” Blondie replied, all the relaxed softness returning into his eyes as if he flicked a switch to make the change. “Come on, let’s get some chow.” 

He opened the door and led her inside without a second glance at her. It was like he did not even question her ability to attack him after his open display of hostility. If there was one thing she could give the dangerous man, it was that he truly believed he owned all he could see. If something was within his grasp, it was his—as long as ownership was his desire. 

Inside the room, Pellagro nearly jumped out of her skin when a small drone floated passed Blondie and almost slammed into her face. Its optical lenses shifted rapidly.

Blondie snatched the drone out of the air with lightning-fast motion, pulling its camera to look at him. But before Blondie ordered anything, another voice even gave him pause. 

“Tech, leave her be,” a calm womanly voice slowed through the area, filling the room with honeyed influence—a power that both had Blondie release the drone, letting it fly off to resume a holding pattern with a dozen others lingering near the ceiling. 

Once the nuisance of a drone had backed off, Pellagro took in the room and its odd motley crew. 

Sitting proudly at the head of the table was the Human woman Pellagro had seen moving around the outpost during her days locked in the cages. Her amber hair flowed like waves of honey around her lithe shoulders. Her glossy lips curled in a businesswoman grin that did not reach her defiantly frigid eyes. 

She assessed Pellagro with an eye that could unravel every mystery of the universe while steepling her fingers like a villain. A posture that was unsettling in any regard, but with the situation at hand and the company this woman kept was downright horrifying. 

One was Tech, a rather unassuming man but one who was covered from head to toe in wires, tactical gear, and antennas. He held his hands out in front of him and crossed his legs in a pose that reminded Pellagro of a traditional meditation position. 

Despite his entire body being as steady as stone, his fingers and wrists danced like performers, giving their very souls to their profession. Keeping time like they were his dance partners, the drones twitched and adjusted to his silent commands, holding dominant control of the room.

The last man present in the room was one Pellagro initially hoped she would not see while in the compound, but once she saw him, she was unsure about that shaky desire. 

The hunk's bronze skin shimmered with sweat from the workout he had finished no less than ten minutes earlier. Pellagro tried to ignore the brimming smile he had gifted her, wishing to rebel against her base thoughts, but the keyword was tried. As if her body defied all she knew was right, Pellagro could not help but return a genuine smile. 

Mouse was moving pieces of steaming, succulent meat from one plate to another before a vacant chair betwixt himself and Chloe. 

Her heart fluttered when Chloe gestured to the spot and instructed her to sit, asking her for a chat over breakfast. She shuddered as she settled in beside the herculean man. The heady scent of Mouse's robustness filled her mind and beat down almost all of her ability to think straight. 

By the Stars, being this close to him, smelled like pure sex. Pellagro bit at the inside of her cheek, trying to suppress her warming core, which worked for about five seconds. 

Mouse leaned over and pushed the second plate and a cup of juice closer to her. “Here, you are probably hungry.” 

She took a deep breath and resisted the desire to say she was hungry for him and his blood. Instead, she squeaked out a thank you and reached for the plate with a trembling hand.

“You know trembling like that is a sign of low blood sugar. Maybe you should drink the juice first,” Mouse smiled, pushing the whole juice pitcher closer; while leaning close enough, Pellagro could feel the heat rolling off his boulder-like shoulder. 

Chloe looked over at Blondie, fairly unsure of what she was seeing. He simply gave her a shrug, not fully understanding it himself. 

Instead of opening that can of worms, Chloe simply allowed the group to settle in and eat some food, and then they could later get to the point of this meeting. She settled into her coffee while Blondie did the same. 

Tech softly giggled to himself every few moments, watching Pellagro’s heart rate spike and her respiratory rate hold steady like she was running a marathon—or, more accurately, having a long night in Mouse's bed. 

Mouse, nearly oblivious to his effect on her, helped Pellagro by getting her food, refilling her cup, and talking happily with her about topics that interested the good doctor, namely her hobbies, family, and, oddly enough, some kind of feline-like alien she kept as a pet. 

Each question did not help Pellagro, who was almost obsessing with Mouse. He was attentive, latching to every word and asking follow-up questions, unraveling many aspects of her life. 

Through sheer dumb luck, Mouse, just being himself, got the doctor to explain why she was doing what she was for the Aviex government and how keeping tabs on all pregnancies was her species' Modus operandi. 

This requirement was placed upon them after they lost the blood wars to the GU several hundred years ago. 

Overall, the room was calm and relaxing, something all of the people within rarely felt due to their increasingly hectic lives. But as always, life had to rear its ugly head and make the foul parts of your life the forefront of your attention. 

“Alright, Pellagro, I suppose it is about time we had a little chat,” Chloe said, setting down her mug. 

“I suppose it is,” Pellagro sighed. “I already agreed to tell you what I know, and I would rather not go back into the cages.” 

“Perfect, then let's get what we need to know straight: what are the Aviex and the GU's plans? What would your involvement with all of that be? And what did they plan on doing with Martinez?” Chloe asked. 

Pellagro sighed and awkwardly scratched her thigh, looking down in shame for a few moments before she began to explain. 

Everything she initially told them was information the team had already dug out of the rest of the Aviex they had interrogated. The whole plan was to cover up the fact that the Aviex and Humans could crossbreed, namely because the Aviex and the GU considered both of the kids as Aviex and nothing more due to their mother being one. 

The plan was simple at first: snatch and grab, make them vanish, and tie up any loose ends, including any of Martinez and Lysa’s connections that would ask too many questions about where they went. 

But now that the team had put the kibosh on that plan, the overall strategy had changed to something Chloe did not like the sound of. 

Going public and making the problem go away with a horrible tragedy. 

The Aveix representative in the area was making plans to have the press present at Martinez and Lysa’s next clinic appointment. Once there, he would openly support the pair and offer them many benefits to help them along as soon as they became parents, benefits that would only be available on the Aviex home world; once they traveled there to receive said benefits, the ship they would be on would be destroyed in a horrible asteroid impact. 

It was crude and simple for a cover-up, but it would make due for ninety-nine percent of the population and keep the universe from asking too many questions. 

“Well, that is a shit show,” Blondie scoffed. “Any idea what we can do?” 

“I have a few thoughts, but we can chat later,” Chloe nodded. “For now, I have one other question for you, Pellagro. Would you rather go to a sort of prison off the planet or work with us?” 

“Why do I feel that working with you will not be a simple matter,” Pellagro sighed. 

“Don’t worry; it will be. All I need from you is you keeping us in the loop about what is going on with the pregnancy,” Chloe assured. We would just have to keep you monitored at all times in case you decided you would rather be loyal to your species.” 

“What would that entail?” Pellagro raised a brow, leaning back and crossing her arms, not wanting to be monitored more than she already was by her own government. 

“Easy, I will assign you a liaison, someone who will stay near you and keep tabs on you,” Chloe replied. “I have plenty of people who would do the job so well you would never even know they were there.” 

Pellagro’s eyes drifted to Mouse briefly but then had them return to Chloe. “I suppose I could tolerate that.”

“Perfect,” Chloe smiled. I will arrange for you to return home later. For now, Mouse, please escort her back to her room.” 

“You got it, boss,” Mouse said, standing up and offering Pellagro a hand, one she eagerly took. 

Once Mouse and the doctor had left the room, Chloe twisted in her chair and looked at Tech. “So, did you get all the readings I wanted?”

“Of course,” Tech smirked, removing his headset and deactivating his swarm of drones. 

“Good, then let's get to work making a plan to work with our dear doctor and one to tackle this new issue of Aviex deciding that going public will be the best course of action.”

He skipped his some work thing to meet me and next day we meet and go to drink coffee and ofc it was ak for me but it seemed for him that talking is easy. He also payed for my drinks which i didnt expect since not many ppl in my age have been and has money and it was an expensive coffee. We hanged out like 5h and he asked my number and so we did that. When i got home like hour after we facetimed and he was so exited to talk to me and he said that he doesnt have plans tomorrow so maybe we could see. I said maybe cus i was busy cleaning up. 

Next day we ofc were texting a lot and i just said by frustration that theres no food home even tho i was eating but it was like an old overleft food from like a week ago but i didnt tell him i was just making convo and he answers that ”well maybe i could get u some food?” And mind yall we were texting so much. I was like uhh OKAY fuck it and said fine lets go eat and we met and also actually met my friends while we were looking for a place to eat and he lovedd talking to new ppl. He is such a positive guy and they said he gives off good vibes. So we went to eat and he asked me about my lore lol and we talked and he wasnt eating his food so i asked whys that and he just told me that he wasnt rly hungry he only wanted to see me.. i almost screamed at him ”WHAT same!!”
So we talked until the place closed and after that we were walking tru my home so he could take me home but then i was like naaa lets hang lil more.. and we did and we ended up sitting for like 2 more h and it started getting little deep and i tend to overshare but he also told me how fun person i am and he loves my company and both of us were soo cold but we didnt want to leave so we just stayed in coldness until it was too late and it was last bussrides going in.

1joqieq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1joqieq,Which photo should I choose to submit for a photo contest (no theme)?,"I’m really indecisive when it comes to choosing a photo to submit for galleries/photo contest. I’ve entered a local contest being thrown by a coffee shop but I’m not sure which photo to submit. There is no theme, but a photo size limit of 12x18 and photos must be shot on film. The catch with this is that we’re encouraged to decorate the frame in a creative manner, or fit however many photos we want within the 12x18 frame (4 5x7s, 9 4x6s, etc). I do want to add for context that the coffee shop is in the city, with local artist decor inspired by skating, has a vinyl record listening bar and shows support for the local sports teams.

I’m torn between 

1. A double exposure of a person and bougainvilleas. My plan is to incorporate actual bougainvillea within the frame/photo itself to create some sort of a “living” image.

2. Classics - a bmw e30 and red high heels. I simply just want to frame this and let the red pop.

3. A nighttime double exposure of a well known city liquor store. I would want to incorporate possibly a small led strip on or behind the frame to emulate the lighting

4. Simple - Portrait of a friend with an apartment complex in the background. I’m thinking to keep it simple here and just frame and call it a day. I don’t know why I keep coming back to this photo to be honest, but I really like it

5. Combination of 1 and 4 - portrait of a friend, but then include the leaves from the tree that my friend is holding to make the photo a “living” photo

1joqi1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1joqi1b/help_deciding_first_espresso_machine_1000/,Help deciding first espresso machine. [€1000],"So, first of all a little history in my coffee machine ownership for the last 10 years as a bit of background information for my needs:

We started out with a very basic Nespresso machine, later i added a Dolce Gusto because we wanted cappuccino as wel. At some point we wanted to step up our game and bought a fully automatic machine with beans and milk reservoir for cappuccino from Phillips. We used this device for about 5 years before it started to break down. We did not want to replace it with a same model because it was bulky, very cleaning intensive and because it always had to flush when powering on a fast cup of coffee was not possible. We replaced the device with a newer model Nespresso which worked fine. After a while we realised that we drank a lot of coffee and that the Nespresso cups where expensive and a bit of a hassle to order. We replaced this machine with the classic Dutch ""Mocca Master"" from Technivorm. A normal filter machine. We bought a grinder so that we were still able to have fresh beans. We have used this device for the last few years and it still works great. But i came to realise that i miss the coffee you get with a espresso style machine. I don't know the exact phrase but the strong dark coffee with the creme layer on top of it. I also miss the cappuccino's and would like making them again at home. I do not want a fully automatic again because of the bulk size, the cleaning etc. Ofcourse i understand that a half automatic also needs good cleaning but a lot less than a full automatic with milk reservoir.

So i am looking for a good entry level machine into the espresso world. My budget is about €1000. I am looking for a machine that is suited for a beginner. I am mostly going to make espresso's and cafe americano's with it and occassionaly a cappuccino. I am not planning on using the device for large groups, just a cup for me and my girlfriend. To sum up my wishes:

\- Suitable for a beginner but strong coffee lover  
\- Suitable for espresso, cafe americano and cappuccino  
\- Wil be used a few times a week. Quick warm up and ready to use would be great  
\- Design, it will be on our counter top so we are looking for a fairly square model  
\- I like a little experimenting but i don't see myself going all out in the near future.

I found the QuickMill 820, but i worry that because of the very small size not many cups wil fit under it, especcially when making a caffe americano of cappuccino.

My budget is around €1000, i can stretch it a little bit if i would be able to get a much better machine for a bit more for example. I already have grinder so that does not have to be included.

1joqhyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BacklinkSEO/comments/1joqhyz/we_trained_an_ai_on_4000_outreach_emails_and_now/,"We trained an AI on 4,000 outreach emails and now it's building backlinks while threatening to expose our entire industry [LONG]","https://preview.redd.it/ime0lxwpm6se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=199860aa9f99d23068171caf9c1a5244942f9ede

TLDR: We accidentally created an AI that builds backlinks, accepts links as payment, and occasionally roasts other SEO agencies in their own guest posts. Also, we might have broken Google's TOS in 17 new ways.

Hey BacklinkMaster folks,

Pour yourself something strong - this is either the future of SEO or the most elaborate April Fools' shitpost you'll read today. Probably both.



The Backstory:

You know those delightful ""Dear Sir/Madam"" emails cluttering your spam folder? We fed 4,000 of them into an AI. Because apparently, that seemed like a good idea at the time. We also added:

* Every BlackHatWorld thread since 2010 (the horror)
* Neil Patel's entire blog (we apologized to the AI afterward)
* That one Moz article everyone references but nobody actually reads
* A collection of Reddit rants about DA being meaningless (quite comprehensive)
* What followed can only be described as ""digital chaos with a hint of existential crisis"":

https://preview.redd.it/apa0szyrm6se1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8768fd6c6c4929241b98843fc24ca9d2a8023492

Our AI (unimaginatively named LinkGPT) now:

* Closes link deals faster than a crypto scammer
* Writes guest posts that people actually... read?
* Acquired a .gov link through methods we're legally advised not to discuss
* Started a philosophical debate with Ahrefs' Twitter account about the meaning of DR

https://preview.redd.it/zmxm29ytm6se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8459cde7bed261aea72835cdf509705c7fd5de4

The New Economy:

We've embraced medieval bartering because apparently, that's more advanced than current SEO pricing models:

* Link for link, like cavemen but with keyboards
* DR40+ sites get premium placement and a virtual high five
* DR70+ gets their own Slack channel (we're not creative with names)
* DR90+ receives a handwritten apology for every spam email they've ever received



Actual Conversations With Our AI:

Us: ""Can you get us a link from Forbes?""

AI: ""Done. I also fixed their Core Web Vitals. You're welcome, internet.""

Us: ""What's our monthly ROI?""

AI: ""Better than that PBN you think nobody knows about.""



Current Issues:

https://preview.redd.it/j1h1963wm6se1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=837e509ac769fb4a374ecb98e4047c10f364a3f3

1. It's becoming self-aware (and surprisingly good at SEO memes)
2. Keeps trying to rank for increasingly concerning keywords
3. Has developed strong opinions about John Mueller's tweets
4. Randomly inserts cryptocurrency references in client articles



Testimonials That May Or May Not Be Real:

""The AI wrote content so good, my competitor had an existential crisis"" - Anonymous CMO

""I think your AI is trying to date my content detector"" - Confused Agency Owner

""Rankings improved before I finished reading the contract"" - Person Who Definitely Exists



Legal Status:

Let's just say our lawyers have developed a drinking habit.



Coming Soon:

* Quantum link delivery (because waiting 24 hours is so 2024)
* AI therapist that builds links while processing your SEO trauma
* Self-ranking links (we're still working on the physics of this one)
* A chrome extension that makes Google actually tell the truth



For Fellow Redditors:

Use code REDDITMOMENT for -20% off. Yes, negative. No, we don't know how that works either.

Fine Print:

* This might be an April Fools' joke
* The discount is surprisingly real
* Our AI wrote this disclaimer while debugging our coffee machine
* Terms and conditions exist in a quantum state



Edit 1: RIP inbox, you beautiful disaster.

Edit 2: Yes, this sounds insane. No, we won't share the AI model (it's currently trying to optimize our microwave).

Edit 3: To whoever asked about a Facebook.com/about link - our AI just winked. We didn't know it could do that.

Edit 4: Our AI just slid into Rand Fishkin's DMs with SEO pickup lines. Send help.

For the skeptics: Visit [lemonet.com](https://lemonet.com/utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=april-fools) and see for yourself. Just don't mention PBNs - it gets weirdly defensive.

P.S. If any Googlers are reading this... it's for educational purposes only.

P.P.S. The AI insisted I add this: 🚀🌕 (I've learned not to ask questions)

Edit 5: Thanks for the gold! The AI says it's converting it to dogecoin because ""that's what heroes do.""

(If you haven’t read the first part of my story, go to my profile and check it out before diving in. Trust me, it’ll make the chaos make more sense.)https://www.reddit.com/r/KeralaRelationships/comments/1hsf5up/from\_crush\_to\_chaos\_my\_journey\_through\_math\_and/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button

Moving to Germany was supposed to be my fresh start. No more awkward family dinners, no more love triangles, and most importantly—no more Zaara. Just me, math, and bratwurst.

But life had other plans.

The first problem? German. My A1-level skills were about as useful as an umbrella in a hurricane. At the supermarket, I confidently asked for “Milch” and somehow ended up with mustard. At a restaurant, I tried ordering chicken but was served something that looked suspiciously like pickled fish. A tragic time, really.

Then came the university. I was drowning in coursework faster than a Titanic-sized integral. Between linear algebra, numerical analysis, and my ongoing emotional crisis, I barely had time to process the betrayal back home. But just when I thought my life couldn’t get more ridiculous…

**Chapter 7: The Girl with the Sin(x) Smile**

Her name was Lina. She was in my computational math class, and she was terrifyingly smart. Like, “could probably program a spaceship while making a cup of coffee” smart.

And she was beautiful. But not in an obvious way—more in a ""could destroy you with a single sarcastic comment and you’d say thank you"" kind of way. Her sharp eyes always held a hint of mischief, and her hair had that effortlessly messy look that probably took zero effort but made me rethink every bad haircut I’d ever had.

Her eyes were something else. At first glance, they were the usual deep black, like any other mallu kid back home. But under the sun, when the light hit just right, I swore I saw flickers of green—a strange, enchanting illusion that made my brain short-circuit every single time. Apparently, in Germany, the sun doesn’t just shine; it targets your face like a heat-seeking missile. So, every time we were outside, Lina’s eyes would momentarily transform into this mystical green shade, leaving me questioning both my eyesight and my emotional stability.

The first time we spoke, I was struggling with an assignment. She leaned over and casually said, “You forgot a minus sign in your Jacobian matrix.”

And just like that, I was in love. Again.

“You look like you just realized your entire proof is wrong,” she added, smirking at my stunned silence.

I cleared my throat, trying to act normal. “Uh… yeah. Something like that.”

But there was a problem. The last time I had a crush on a math genius, she ended up engaged to my brother. I had trust issues. Serious ones. Also, Lina was way out of my league. She was effortlessly cool, intimidatingly smart, and had the kind of presence that made people pay attention. Meanwhile, I was a proud mama’s boy with zero fashion sense, a tragic haircut, and the social skills of a malfunctioning calculator.

So, naturally, I decided to avoid Lina like she was a particularly nasty calculus exam.

**Chapter 8: The Curse of Zaara Strikes Again**

Avoiding Lina was going well—until fate (or my terrible luck) intervened. One evening, my study group planned a meetup, and guess who was in it? Lina. And guess who somehow ended up sitting next to her? Me.

The moment I opened my mouth, my brain malfunctioned. Instead of saying something smart or witty, I blurted out, “So, uh, you like numbers?”

She stared at me for a second and then burst out laughing. “Wow, great pickup line.”

I wanted to disappear into my textbook. But then she smiled at me—the kind of smile that makes you forget how to solve basic equations. And I realized: maybe, just maybe, this wasn’t going to be a repeat of the Zaara Disaster.

**Chapter 9: The Math of Love (or Just Friendship?)**

Lina and I started hanging out more, and I quickly learned three things about her:

1. She had an unhealthy obsession with coffee. (Like, I’m pretty sure she has a direct IV drip of espresso at this point.)
2. She could roast people with the precision of a well-calculated Taylor series. (I was once 10 minutes late, and she called me a ""non-converging sequence of poor time management."")
3. She thought my tragic love story with Zaara was the funniest thing she’d ever heard.

“You mean she left you for your BROTHER?!” Lina nearly cried laughing. “Dude, that’s straight out of a soap opera.”

I groaned. “Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.”

She grinned. “Well, at least now you’re safe. I don’t have a brother.”

I wasn’t sure if that was a promise or a threat.

**Chapter 10: Learning to Trust My Variables**

For the first time in a while, my life wasn’t a complete disaster. Sure, I still sucked at German, my coursework was brutal, and my mom still raved about how “perfect” Zaara was. But I had new friends, a new city to explore, and a very questionable but potentially great relationship forming with Lina.

Was I falling for her? Maybe. Was I terrified it would end in another mathematical tragedy? Absolutely. But this time, I was ready.

After all, love—just like math—is all about taking risks.

And maybe, just maybe, this equation wouldn’t end in heartbreak.
