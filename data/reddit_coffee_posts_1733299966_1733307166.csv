1h6cqpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1h6cqpt/i_feel_unappreciated_and_im_getting_tired/,I feel unappreciated and I'm getting tired,"My SO has a 7 year old daughter with his ex. We've been in a relationship for a year now and from the beginning my SO was always transparent about our relationship with BM and he initially was very open about things with BM with me. As soon as BM found out about our relationship she made it clear she was going to be very problematic. I had offered to meet her for a coffee to talk so she gets to know me since i will be spending time with her daughter. She refused. My SO was always positive and thought things will get better by time as she will accept the situation, and since then BM also entered into a serious relationship so we thought things will improve. However they didn't. 

My SD has ADHD and also has other special needs but she lives a normal life now. She doesn't listen, and has been very spoilt due to her special needs which results in us not being able to discipline her in any way. We tried different methods and ways however without her mother cooperating its not working. Furthermore due to this i feel very drained when she is around. 

My SO and I had multiple conversations about this. I am very hands on and initially was doing my 200% to help, doing things for my SD which I'm not responsible for and reading up on her situation and trying to educate myself to make things better for all of us. However when i did these things they were not appreciated and was told to take a step back and let the biological parents do the parenting. Reluctantly, I took took the step back, as my intention is always to help. However we keep having the same issues repeating themselves and i am getting very tired and frustrated.

BM constantly changes schedule in her favour without prior announcements. This has been a major issue for me and my SO as we have 60%-40% arrangement and on our off days i make plans. When BM decides to change, my SO almost never discusses it with me and i tend to find out last minute due to a random question i make about the evening plans. I keep asking my SO to stop accepting last minute changes from BM as she should be responsible to organise her life around her daughter. From our side we never make changes unless its a one off trip that we couldn't move to our off weekend and we advice in advance. BM is always attacking my SO for not being communicative and in reality its always her the issue. My SO then feels bad for his daughter and always accepts but does not take into consideration how it will effect my plans. SO and SD live with me. When i yet again voice my disappointment in not being informed or included in the discussion i get arguements and accusations towards me. 

Am i in the wrong for asking to be included in decisions that are with regards to my SD that would effect my day and my plans? Should i be accepting of everything that comes my way as a SM for the sake of my SD?

I feel very guilty when I'm made to feel bad about such things especially when i know that i am doing everything i can to give a good life and example to my SD.  I always go out of my way to make people happy, but im now terrified that i am going to lose myself in this situation and end up resenting my SD for having to accomodate my plans around her BM schedule because my SO can't say no to anything that is with regards to his child.",1,1733306989.0,stepparents,1,1.0,False

1h6cq5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeBox/comments/1h6cq5p/day_4_amateur_review/,Day 4. Amateur review,"Today, I've decided to do things a bit differently. I didn't want to check what I was tasting before I tasted it and tried to understand. And to some extent, this particular pick made things a bit simpler on one hand and super exciting on the other.



[Day 4 was brewed with Aeropress](https://preview.redd.it/3mjxmmwu2t4e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be94f41aae83dad0f9d2605f4c73631b977e33a7)

The moment you open the canister, even before you smell anything, you know you're most certainly looking at something extraordinary. My first thought - ""Oh my, Maragogipe!"" (I mean the beans are real ""jumbo""). Then, it was - ""No, it can't be it - I have not seen it in Norway. Should be Pacamara"". Then, you think, yes, it should be Central America, so you prepare yourself for a nice, sweet, balanced cup. And that was my setup that affected the remaining experience today. Expecting a well-rounded, balanced cup, I picked Aeropress as the brewer today to play nicely with it (not that it's easy to find specialty coffee that goes bad with Aeropress, but still üòÖ). So, the impressions you find below were the result of my blind testing just for fun. At the end I compare it to the actual information.

  
**ROAST:**

As I said, the beans are really big. And that distracts a bit when comparing the lightness of the roast - these beans take so much space that their color just always dominates. But it's still a bit lighter than Day 1 geisha and comparable in light with yesterday's (Day 3) bourbon. The latter comparison is, in particular, hard due to a lot of husks in Day 3 bourbon (while today's pick is very clean), but the color of the beans themselves is very comparable. Check for yourself

[Day 1  \(left\) vs Day 4 \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/sa73swkgvs4e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe8c6551c178530cfd771974efafc4f787176c8b)

[Day 3 \(left\) vs Day 4 \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/0qvdl6yivs4e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6aecb88ece3113bd1ddf39ef1a7babe80ebbfa1a)

**AROMA:**

It was the first pick in this calendar when I could smell coffee's identity right off the canister. I clearly could smell some distinct acidity that reminded me of red wine. This was the first moment I started doubting my conclusion about Pacamara. It smelled not so much Pacamara, I think. But I didn't think too much about it and just continued the journey.

When grounded, coffee transformed dramatically. The first impression was sweet chocolate and baked sweet goods (ginger bread?), somewhat buttery with some pleasant acidity still in the background. All in all, the aroma of grounded beans was very pleasant. At this moment, I really started questioning whether I dealt with Pacamara - it all hinted more at some bourbon varietal. But, again, I'm not a pro by any means, and the number of varietals I have dealt with is limited anyway. So, I decided not even to try to identify the varietal and instead just focus on the aroma, taste, and pleasure.

As aforementioned, today I've brewed with Aeropress, using Hoffman's ultimate recipe with 11g grounded at 13 clicks on Comandante. We will get to tasting below, but when it comes to aroma after brewing it knocked me off. The very first thing I smelled in the brew was‚Ä¶ apple. So distinct ripe apple that I totally didn't expect that I was puzzled. While still hot, the brew had a lot of greens and freshness in it that one couldn't expect by smelling coffee before the brew. As the brew cooled down, I started getting cherries. But it was clear that coffee is too complex to identify any other notes/sub-notes here. And this complexity was so enjoyable. After some tries of identifying the aroma notes in the brew, I just accepted that I can not get too deep here and just enjoyed the aroma. 

**TASTE:**

Just like the aroma of the brew, the taste was very complex. I still could identify cherries, but as most brews in Aeropress, this one turned out to be very balanced, sweet with very pleasant acidity. Which made it hard to identify distinct notes. I think this coffee should be analyzed during proper cupping to fully understand it, but it's so good that I want to enjoy the whole canister brewing proper cups instead of cupping :)

I will brew it with Origami later today which, supposedly, will reveal more notes (I will post a comment below with those findings), but one can be certain that this cup won't disappoint by any means. It's interesting, it's transforming, it's complex on so many levels that it has something to offer to any taste, really.

  
**DISCOVERIES:**

After my brew, I naturally wanted to get the correct information about the beans. First of all, stunning job, Jacu! The roast is gentle enough to leave beans with a lot of personality so we can taste the beans, not the roast üëè Secondly, I was please to see that these jumbo beans, indeed, are relatives of Maragogype (on the other hand, it's really hard to miss with this guess). It was the first time I tasted Maracaturra, but I'm sure it won't be the last. What really surprised me was the list of notes. I could pick cherries, but I didn't pick one of my favorite notes - grapes. I clearly didn't get any orange. But the ""red wine"" notes, both in aroma and in taste, now became clear and turned out to be raspberry. So now I want to brew this coffee with Origami even more (and follow the recipe on the website) to see whether I could get all of those exciting notes next time.

I recently received a Sage Barista Express as a wedding gift. But I‚Äôm having some trouble making good espressos.

I use Douwe Egberts Aroma Red coffee beans. I‚Äôm getting totally 0 pressure. I tried the following:

* Using just water trough the portafilter
* Adjusting the grind level to the finest (also the one inside the coffeebean holder).
* When using the double filter one I do get the right pressure but the water is not flowing smoothly (also using just water).

All of the above is also tested with beans ofcourse.

What can I do to improve the pressure?

1h6cmuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h6cmuh/worried_my_31f_boyfriends_not_over_his_33m/,"Worried my (31/F) boyfriend‚Äôs not over his (33/M) breakup with his ex, now friend. Help?","Hey guys, I know this question, in one form or another, was already asked a ton of times here, but I would really appreciate some help since the circumstances are a bit different.

We‚Äôve been together only for two months, but already he suggested that we move in together in February, once I have to go back to my hometown, as it‚Äôs easier than trying long distance. We‚Äôre now living in the same town, but I need to go back to graduate, as I have one semester left. Anyway, from early on, he keeps mentioning his ex in the most unexpected moments. Like when we were talking about me not eating meat, he mentioned that she also doesn‚Äôt. When I was at his place for the first time and was offered coffee, he told me it was his ex‚Äôs leftover coffee (as he doesn‚Äôt drink coffee). He once referred to her as ‚Äúmy (name).‚Äù

When I asked him which app he uses for listening to music, he told me that they share a Spotify account, stressing that it‚Äôs not a family account but a regular one‚Äîand these days, she‚Äôs the one using it. When I asked him if he visits flea markets, he said he only went once to buy a pocket watch for his ex. Anyway, it was only after a month that he mentioned to me that he was running with her earlier that day and said that his hairdresser told him it‚Äôs weird to stay friends with an ex. Then he asked me what I think about it, and before I even said anything, he told me something like, ‚ÄúBecause I want to stay friends with her. She‚Äôs part of my family now.‚Äù

I said that I was alright with it, as I do think it‚Äôs healthier to stay friends with an ex‚Äîit‚Äôs a sign of maturity, and I was glad to hear that he doesn‚Äôt burn bridges. But from that moment on, he started mentioning every time they met, and I realized they‚Äôre not just friendly but see each other every week, going for runs just the two of them. Once, after a run, he told me, ‚ÄúSomething interesting happened‚Äî(name) told me she was inspired by seeing me find a girl (me) on dating apps, so now she started using them too.‚Äù

At every mention of her, I was silent, as I didn‚Äôt find it relevant to our relationship but assumed they‚Äôd broken up recently, so it was only normal. But that was before I knew they were seeing each other regularly. So, I addressed my worries to him and said I think he might not be completely over the breakup. That‚Äôs when we had our first real talk about it.

I asked him why they broke up, and he said it was because she didn‚Äôt want to have children. He said it was their decision together and refers to it as ‚Äúthe best breakup ever.‚Äù When I asked what would happen if she changed her mind, he told me it wouldn‚Äôt matter (after some hesitation) and that it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway since she decided to get sterilized after they broke up. That hurt me, and I told him so. He said what he said was stupid. As for other reasons for the breakup, he said she looked down on him and didn‚Äôt really support him during his struggles (depression).

So I was like, ‚ÄúBut what do you get from the friendship now?‚Äù And he told me the dynamics are different now. After the last random mention of her (Spotify), I started thinking and realized I really need to try to talk with him again. I told him I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs fully processed his breakup and that if we‚Äôre planning to move in together, that‚Äôs pretty important. It was only then that he told me he might be doing all of this because he feels responsible for her and guilty.

The reason he feels guilty is because he was the one who broke it off, and she told him she didn‚Äôt feel the same and could imagine spending her life with him. A couple of weeks after the breakup, she told him she agrees it‚Äôs good that they broke up. I had no idea about this‚ÄîI thought it was a mutual decision.

They‚Äôve been together for 10 years, and when we started dating it was 7 months after their breakup.

So, I told him I don‚Äôt think he should be in a new serious relationship (at least with me‚Äîmaybe some people wouldn‚Äôt mind) while still having those unresolved feelings. And I said that friendships with an ex can work out very well, but after some time‚Äînot straight after the breakup, like they did. Adding to that, he also told me their talks now are ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù and that he avoids engaging in intimate topics whenever she mentions something more personal.

So I told him we should take some time to think about it, each on our own. How would you proceed further in this situation, hoping he'll stop any contact with her for a while, or finding some other way to approach this? I don‚Äôt want to lose him easily, as he‚Äôs otherwise an amazing person, but I just feel like he‚Äôs not ready. 

TLDR: My boyfriend insists he wants to stay friends with his ex-girlfriend, although admitting that he has some unresolved feelings.",1,1733306519.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

don't worry, dude ill be dropping lore soon 
sorta in a hurry,  to brew coffee before noon

as i duel wield, 

my lyrical weapons, 

to draw teary confessions,

from priests in brown hessian

don't fear the howling beast,

fear the demons, drowning priests

don't press me, please, ill meet the next meat inspector, when ive got the energy

for a quick dissection or vivisection,
u got a vintage erection,
the shrinkage fits in with my dick pic collection,

fuckin pigs, on linked-in, with inked skin, 

eating from skip bins, behind a delicatessen,

the mortuary afforded me a blessing

but they really oughta rate each kill,

each blade dealt, in the game of shills, 


sellout on repeat, til mistakes, self-reveals,

help the children, for real, 1 pound per deal, 

from the dealer, down the hill 

i like kill bill, but that's not real,

why do i still smell oiled steel?

i must be royalty, even loyalists kneel,

im such a nuisance..

youre in love with a mutant,


hes a werewolf with lupus,

a red rocket nudist, on the devils to-do list

so raise a silver spoon to the head of all gooners,

whom rumorists claim, 

still shills for krill, making deals with big kahunas

like jabba the hutt or the villain bib fortuna..

its all love, feels and drug deals, 
ITS NOT A TUMOR
these kids are on pills
that was a rumor‚Ä¶ that shit was unreal,  


how does the son feel, 

now the real moms revealed?

remove the tumor, use humor to shield

i saw your future, its war and sutured seals

caught by abusers, to fight for a ludus,

or do dictating, 

i call that dick-taking,

a 101 for your mom..


who was undressing, 

before you even started stressing, 

bout getting none of none

all in good fun, an english lesson to some 

im a smith n weston, you jumped the gun, 
..u cunt..

just don't become the greasiest creep in the club 

no one loves a trust fund baby, 

no lump sum payment will sway me, 


don't come at me comparing wages, 

I guarentee you leave frustrated 

outflanked in melee, by a guy in a bubble,
who lives like a lady, shes hot property 

so stop yapping at me over money or economy

i want big boy energy - not bit coins or NFTs

ditch the two bit double breasted suit

i dont cum from cufflinks with attitude 

or cumberbuns, on arrogant dudes, 


self awareness is a healthier pursuit  

your incompetence gave me a confidence boost,

maybe im wrong, were you falsely accused?

you played that song on loop, for so long, 
it got long in the tooth, 
long before you got the boot

not an excuse, a review - of obvious truths..

you can always choose to not be a goose, 

wait til the lady says shes down to fuck too!

don't fuck around, in the town of timbuktoo


use whatever it takes to get lucky, for fucks sake

besides cable restraints or ducttape, thats just rape‚Ä¶

big girls don't play pattycake,

I don't give a fuck what money, daddy makes,

im into fatty cakes but

i shed deadweight like dropped pudding, 
if that's what it takes..

to ween you off baby food, 

swap baby blues for hot babes with boobs

it's time you grew up, kid,
go jump in a mosh pit, 
maybe you won't come across, 
quite so ..off-putting

I drink it a fair amount throughout the day, maybe like 4-5 cups a day on average. There seems to be a bit of a fluctuation between how it affects me though. Off the top of my head, it can range from either feeling quite motivated and focused but still level headed and calm, nothing at all and I don‚Äôt feel a difference, being able to have one right before bed and then being able to sleep with no issue, or being really quite energetic after having it.

What I‚Äôm saying is, how it affects me is really inconsistent. For example, the times that I remember when I‚Äôve been energetic after having it have been when I‚Äôve drank a full flask throughout the day (about 4 teaspoons in one flask) and I‚Äôll talk your ear off and be really bubbly. That‚Äôs still rather inconsistent though, because I could either feel like any of the ways that I‚Äôd previously mentioned. Again, at night as well having one before bed, I‚Äôll either sleep with no issue or be awake for the entire night but I won‚Äôt always be energetic. 

It‚Äôs weird how it can affect me differently each time, and was just wondering if this was normal for me and just an ADHD thing. If it is, then I was curious as to whether any of you guys have experienced the same or anything different? ",2,1733306237.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Thank you r/mokapot,"This morning, I tried incorporating some of the very helpful advice I have been receiving and made the best pot yet! Using room temperature water allowed me to get the pot screwed together much tighter than before, which completely eliminated the spluttering and premature steam I had yesterday. I do have silicone mitts so I'll also try it with hot water just to see how that affects the brew. Coffee tasted MUCH smoother, still very strong (which I now know to expect), but after a 1:1 dilution with water and a splash of milk, it was quite enjoyable, and very caffeinating. I think I'd like it even more with frothed or steamed milk, more ala cappuccino, but I have no tools for that (yet), so next time, I will make two diluted cups from the one brew.

Does this brew seem about right to you guys in terms of flow/speed? I'm kinda wondering if I'm supposed to see a little more foam, since this does have 20% robusta in it.",1,1733306125.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Help?","Hey guys, I know this question, in one form or another, was already asked a ton of times here, but I would really appreciate some help since the circumstances are a bit different.

We‚Äôve been together only for two months, but already he suggested that we move in together in February, once I have to go back to my hometown, as it‚Äôs easier than trying long distance. We‚Äôre now living in the same town, but I need to go back to graduate, as I have one semester left. Anyway, from early on, he keeps mentioning his ex in the most unexpected moments. Like when we were talking about me not eating meat, he mentioned that she also doesn‚Äôt. When I was at his place for the first time and was offered coffee, he told me it was his ex‚Äôs leftover coffee (as he doesn‚Äôt drink coffee). He once referred to her as ‚Äúmy (name).‚Äù

When I asked him which app he uses for listening to music, he told me that they share a Spotify account, stressing that it‚Äôs not a family account but a regular one‚Äîand these days, she‚Äôs the one using it. When I asked him if he visits flea markets, he said he only went once to buy a pocket watch for his ex. Anyway, it was only after a month that he mentioned to me that he was running with her earlier that day and said that his hairdresser told him it‚Äôs weird to stay friends with an ex. Then he asked me what I think about it, and before I even said anything, he told me something like, ‚ÄúBecause I want to stay friends with her. She‚Äôs part of my family now.‚Äù

I said that I was alright with it, as I do think it‚Äôs healthier to stay friends with an ex‚Äîit‚Äôs a sign of maturity, and I was glad to hear that he doesn‚Äôt burn bridges. But from that moment on, he started mentioning every time they met, and I realized they‚Äôre not just friendly but see each other every week, going for runs just the two of them. Once, after a run, he told me, ‚ÄúSomething interesting happened‚Äî(name) told me she was inspired by seeing me find a girl (me) on dating apps, so now she started using them too.‚Äù

At every mention of her, I was silent, as I didn‚Äôt find it relevant to our relationship but assumed they‚Äôd broken up recently, so it was only normal. But that was before I knew they were seeing each other regularly. So, I addressed my worries to him and said I think he might not be completely over the breakup. That‚Äôs when we had our first real talk about it.

I asked him why they broke up, and he said it was because she didn‚Äôt want to have children. He said it was their decision together and refers to it as ‚Äúthe best breakup ever.‚Äù When I asked what would happen if she changed her mind, he told me it wouldn‚Äôt matter (after some hesitation) and that it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway since she decided to get sterilized after they broke up. That hurt me, and I told him so. He said what he said was stupid. As for other reasons for the breakup, he said she looked down on him and didn‚Äôt really support him during his struggles (depression).

So I was like, ‚ÄúBut what do you get from the friendship now?‚Äù And he told me the dynamics are different now. After the last random mention of her (Spotify), I started thinking and realized I really need to try to talk with him again. I told him I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs fully processed his breakup and that if we‚Äôre planning to move in together, that‚Äôs pretty important. It was only then that he told me he might be doing all of this because he feels responsible for her and guilty.

The reason he feels guilty is because he was the one who broke it off, and she told him she didn‚Äôt feel the same and could imagine spending her life with him. A couple of weeks after the breakup, she told him she agrees it‚Äôs good that they broke up. I had no idea about this‚ÄîI thought it was a mutual decision.

They‚Äôve been together for 10 years, and when we started dating it was 7 months after their breakup.

So, I told him I don‚Äôt think he should be in a new serious relationship (at least with me‚Äîmaybe some people wouldn‚Äôt mind) while still having those unresolved feelings. And I said that friendships with an ex can work out very well, but after some time‚Äînot straight after the breakup, like they did. Adding to that, he also told me their talks now are ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù and that he avoids engaging in intimate topics whenever she mentions something more personal.

So I told him we should take some time to think about it, each on our own. How would you proceed further in this situation, hoping he'll stop any contact with her for a while, or finding some other way to approach this? I don‚Äôt want to lose him easily, as he‚Äôs otherwise an amazing person, but I just feel like he‚Äôs not ready.

Their soft and neutral hue creates a welcoming atmosphere while offering a versatile backdrop for various design styles. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about incorporating¬†[**cream kitchen cabinets**](https://www.cabinetdiy.com/cream-kitchen-cabinets)¬†into your home.

**Why Choose Cream Kitchen Cabinets?**

1. **Timeless Appeal**: Unlike bold or trendy colors, cream cabinets have a classic aesthetic that stands the test of time.
2. **Versatility**: Cream pairs effortlessly with different materials, colors, and textures, making it suitable for traditional, modern, or farmhouse designs.
3. **Light-Enhancing**: The soft tone of cream reflects light, brightening the kitchen and making it feel more spacious.
4. **Warmth and Comfort**: Cream‚Äôs neutral warmth creates a cozy and inviting ambiance, ideal for the heart of the home.

**Design Styles with Cream Cabinets**

1. **Traditional Charm**: Pair cream cabinets with ornate details, such as crown molding or decorative hardware, for a classic look. Add granite countertops and rich wood flooring to complete the aesthetic.
2. **Modern Minimalism**: Combine sleek cream cabinets with clean lines, stainless steel appliances, and a minimalist backsplash for a contemporary feel.
3. **Farmhouse Appeal**: Match cream cabinets with rustic wood accents, open shelving, and a farmhouse sink for a cozy, country-inspired kitchen.
4. **Coastal Vibes**: Pair cream cabinets with light blue or aqua accents, natural stone, and beach-inspired decor for a breezy, coastal design.

**Pairing Cream Cabinets with Countertops and Backsplashes**

* **Countertops**: Cream cabinets work well with a variety of countertop materials. Marble or quartz in white or beige enhances the elegant look, while dark granite or soapstone provides a striking contrast.
* **Backsplashes**: Subway tiles in white or cream create a seamless and classic appearance. For a bold touch, consider a mosaic or patterned tile with hints of gold or silver.

**Choosing the Right Hardware**

The hardware you choose can dramatically influence the overall look of cream cabinets.

* **Brass or Gold**: Adds warmth and a luxurious feel.
* **Black or Matte Finishes**: Creates a contemporary contrast.
* **Polished Chrome**: Provides a sleek, modern vibe.

**Maintaining Cream Kitchen Cabinets**

Cream cabinets are relatively easy to maintain but require regular cleaning to prevent discoloration. Here are some tips:

* Use a soft, damp cloth and mild soap for daily cleaning.
* Avoid abrasive cleaners that may damage the finish.
* Clean spills promptly to prevent staining, especially with darker liquids like coffee or wine.

**Advantages of Cream Cabinets Over White**

While white cabinets are a popular choice, cream offers a softer alternative that feels less stark. Cream adds subtle warmth, making it especially appealing for homeowners who want a cozy yet sophisticated kitchen.

**Conclusion**

Cream kitchen cabinets are a versatile and timeless choice that can transform any kitchen into a warm and stylish space. Whether paired with traditional details or modern accents, their subtle elegance makes them a favorite for homeowners and designers alike. With proper care and thoughtful design choices, cream cabinets can elevate your kitchen‚Äôs aesthetic and functionality for years to come.",1,1733305576.0,u_holisticlife5500,0,1.0,False

\* Met a BPD girl who love bombed and mirrored me so good, I thought she was the one I'd want to spend the rest of my life with. We partied a lot, sex was incredible. Coke, Molly, weed, NOS, was our usual. 

\* It was a long distance relationship. 1.5 hour plane ride. 

\* 5 months into the relationship found out she was hiding a husband of 20+ years. 

\* Told her I'm not interested in dating someone who is married. She proved to me it has been over between them for almost a decade because he is an abusive partner/ bad person/ bad father/ etc. She would fly over and visit 1-2 times a month and stay for 4-5 days every visit. I figured it was over since no man I know would tolerate his wife always leaving for ""work related"" stuff without questioning.  We were constantly on the phone via video chat or talking. She made me believe it was truly over between them. Our relationship lasted like this  for 15 months.

\* I warned her several times, that I do not tolerate cheating and lies, and most importantly, I am not the type of person to be played around with and tested. 

\* On the 15th month of the relationship she discarded me.  This was after she admitted she's been lying to me about her cocaine use and that she was doing a gram a week (Im sure it's way more after seeing how much she loves cocaine in many previous occasions) Also, she said her husband is now all of a sudden a good person who she has doesn't want to leave, in contrary to the future faking of so many promises she said she would do to finally be together.  I felt so betrayed and lied to. I asked her to please talk to me so I know what is going on with her and how I can help. She refused to. I warned her to stop with the BS and just talk to me because I'm feeling very betrayed and lied to. She refused. I told her I will give her half the day to calm down and talk to me or else I will expose our relationship to her husband. ( this was all done/communicated over text, which I hate because the subject required a talk) 

\* I get a text message saying she ended up telling her husband about us, which was a pure fucking lie. I figured hey if it's true then he already knows and if he already knows, then let's make sure he knows the truth. So I emailed him and told him the relationship and even included pics of us. 

\* I experienced a handful of hoovering and discard over the phone for the last 4.5 months. 

\* I had to attend a social event in her city a couple weekends ago and stayed at my best friend's house. I called her and asked if she wanted to have coffee and catch up and I can give her back her belongings. She agreed to it and was excited to see me.  I told her part of the reason why I want to see her is because my blood tests show something abnormal which had the high possibility of leukemia. Told her I was scared about it. 

\* When I landed in her city I got several text messages that she doesn't think she can see me, she doesn't know what to do, she wants to see, she changed her mind like 10 times within a span of 20 min. 

\* She finally agreed to meet. Instead of having coffee she said she couldn't go inside the restaurant due to a family emergency but wanted her stuff back. Gave it to her. She looked like she didn't even shower, her hair was nasty and she didn't look anything like the demure person I once knew. She looked straight up like a meth head coming off a bender. She took her stuff and left leaving me without a ride. 

\* I stayed and my best friend's house, which was like 10 minutes from her house. earlier this year he needed some coke so I gave him her number because she knows all the connections in her city. 

\* During the social event my best friend was throwing, we had couple drinks and decided to head to his car because he said he had a little coke left. That's when I noticed it. The little bottle he had in his car was hers. it was her favorite little coke dispenser and it was almost empty. 

\* I told him that looks familiar. Isn't that XXXXXXX's ? He said yeah she gave it to me like 4 months ago. 

Im still in shock. This woman completely fabricated who she was and now I think she was doing cocaine with my best friend and they messed around. It was after all this that I found out about BPD and this subreddit. 

I remember many times she'd do cocaine in my car and gave me a blowjob when she's dusted out of her mind.  I haven't spoken to my best friend about it since most of the time I was there he was telling me to stop thinking about her and that she's a broken person.  I want to ask him soon but I haven't figured out how. He's a newly married man and I always thought he was happy in his marriage.

I try to think about if she would do it but at the same time, I don't even know who she is. 

Do you think they're messing around? ",2,1733305411.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False

Imagine this: it‚Äôs the summer of 2054. We‚Äôre on the porch of a cozy house‚Äîone of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we‚Äôre there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed‚Äîjust the warmth of each other‚Äôs company.

It‚Äôs not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary‚Äîthe way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I‚Äôm here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I‚Äôm a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you‚Äôre patient, you‚Äôll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it‚Äôs the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I‚Äôm looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book‚Äîsomething natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here‚Äôs what makes my story unique:**  
üéµ **Music as a Muse:** A future vinyl collector searching for a space, a lover of playlists that take you on a journey, and songs that feel like a warm hug. Music has a unique way of connecting moments, and I love finding the perfect soundtrack for every memory. Got a favorite song? Share it‚ÄîI‚Äôm always ready to discover melodies that move you.  
üåç **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it‚Äôs chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I‚Äôm all about exploring the world‚Äîboth near and far. Life‚Äôs too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
üìö **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can‚Äôt quite say aloud. And recently, I‚Äôve been dabbling in photography‚Äîturning moments into memories through a lens.  
üïπÔ∏è **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there‚Äôs something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôm searching for someone who‚Äôs as curious about the world as I am‚Äîa woman who is kind at heart, sharp of mind, and carries a quiet strength that makes you want to know every story behind her smile. Someone who‚Äôs not just eager to explore the world around us but also willing to dive into the uncharted territory of creating a world together.

A partner in curiosity, someone who loves sharing dreams and building them into something real. Whether it‚Äôs small projects, grand adventures, or simply learning to navigate life‚Äôs challenges side by side, I want to create something unique with you‚Äîa shared journey filled with meaning, discovery, and connection.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I‚Äôll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I‚Äôll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order‚Äînot because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I‚Äôll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too‚Äîthe random text when I know you‚Äôre having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn‚Äôt. The best stories aren‚Äôt about grand gestures; they‚Äôre about the quiet consistency of someone who‚Äôs truly there for you.

I‚Äôm also a romantic‚Äînot in the clich√© way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I‚Äôm the kind of person who‚Äôll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something‚Äôs on your mind, I‚Äôll always want to hear it. Because real stories‚Äîthe ones worth telling‚Äîare built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you‚Äôre someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones‚Äîa cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let‚Äôs start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world‚Äôs quirks and wonders. Maybe we‚Äôll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two. And if the story decides to write itself into something more, we‚Äôll let it‚Äîafter all, the best tales often begin with an unexpected chapter.

If this resonates, let‚Äôs start the first line of what could be an unforgettable story. One filled with porch swings, golden sunsets, and the kind of connection that makes you believe in the magic of ‚Äúwhat if.‚Äù Let‚Äôs see where the words take us.",2,1733305314.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I find visits from my in laws so overwhelming; my FIL doesn‚Äôt use google translate although he knows how to (he used for his first trip to us), he just finds it annoying. Which means, he just talks at me in his language and hopes I magically understand (I don‚Äôt!). 

This is made all the more difficult when I‚Äôm with my toddler or in a public situation. If my husband isn‚Äôt available to translate, we cannot understand each other unless I use google translate. I don‚Äôt have the freedom and time to type out what I want to say, while managing my toddler. I have to yell for my husband to come back. 

I can see my husband gets exhausted by it too, by being used as the translator. He asks his parents to use it but they don‚Äôt. He just says his dad is too stubborn. 

It means that I find FILs visits very overwhelming, he‚Äôs a very helpful and kind man, but not being able to speak to each other about very important things is difficult.

My husband wants my FIL to stay, in our 1 bed flat while we have two children (baby and toddler). If I have to get up with baby at 4am, I‚Äôd bring him to the lounge to settle him and put him in his Moses basket and try to sleep a little more myself (in the lounge). 

If FIL was staying here, he‚Äôd start talking to me in his language while I have the baby; after I‚Äôve just woken up at 4am. Before I could even drink a cup of coffee, I‚Äôd be having to get google translate out, ignore my baby to do this etc. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep in the lounge with my baby and FIL. 

My husband is upset that he ‚Äòwon‚Äôt get to see his parents‚Äô because I said it‚Äôs too much if FIL comes while we have such a small space, and I need the lounge to settle baby. I suggested that a hotel, given the circumstances, would be very reasonable and of course we will pay (we wouldn‚Äôt want or let FIL pay). In his culture, family don‚Äôt stay in hotels when they visit‚Ä¶ so in my husband‚Äôs mind, he can‚Äôt see his father‚Ä¶

I'm a 26-year-old woman, and I live with two other women, Anna (25) and Banana (36) fake names obviously. We share a house, but Banana is making it unbearable. She has ADHD and dyslexia, and while I understand that, her behavior is incredibly disruptive and inconsiderate.

Banana leaves food out for days, attracting fruit flies, and refuses to clean up. Her personal compost even leaked on the counter. She also has strict rules about her celiac disease, which gives her control over half the kitchen. I can‚Äôt even use her couch or coffee table, which isn't a problem but it's in the middle of the room. 

She stomps loudly when she walks, slams doors when she‚Äôs angry, and refuses to flush the toilet. I‚Äôve had to repeatedly ask her to be more hygienic and clean up after herself, but she just gets defensive and doesn't change. She also washes one dish at a time, leaving the kitchen a drippy, wet mess, making it impossible for anyone else to use the space.

She has a high-energy dog, a miniature pinscher, who she hasn‚Äôt trained at all. The dog disrupts everything, and Banana yells at him or physically restrains him, but nothing gets better. I have a cat, and Banana‚Äôs dog is always chasing her, grabbing her by the neck, and tearing off her collar.

Whenever I have a guest over or try to use the living room, Banana blows up, claiming she‚Äôs entitled to watch her shows at full volume. 

She also kicked the tenants downstairs out of using the garage for storage and now refuses to let them access the laundry room without me intervening.

Anna and I both want to move out because we can‚Äôt deal with Banana‚Äôs behavior anymore. It‚Äôs giving me so much stress that I jump at the sound of any car door slamming, and I‚Äôm starting to get PTSD from it.

I have a place lined up to move to at the end of February, but I‚Äôm really struggling right now.

Feeling drained ,"I really need perspective on a friendship situation that's becoming increasingly draining. For context, I've been friends with this person for a while, but recently I've noticed some concerning patterns in how she handles boundaries and relationships.

Last week, I sent her a very vulnerable, honest message explaining that I needed some space because I'm dealing with a lot (upcoming move, new job, family issues, health concerns) and feeling overwhelmed. I was clear but kind, even apologizing for being ""heavy"" and expressing gratitude for her friendship.

Her immediate response? Suggesting we meet for coffee. When I didn't respond, she tried again a few days later asking to hang out. Today, she messages with ""Hello old friend üòÇ"" (we literally talked last week) and asks for a favor.

This pattern of boundary pushing isn't new. She has done this sort of thing before and I allowed it. She just got out of a situation with a guy where she would create fake emergencies (like needing things fixed in her flat) just to force contact after he set boundaries. Now she's using the same tactics with me - creating ""emergencies"" or reasons to connect when I've explicitly said I need space.

I've always felt like a therapist or some AI bot she just dumps on and even before this stressful period of my life found myself becoming irritated by her. This is now how a friendship should be 

She's in therapy but doesn't seem to be implementing any changes. My other friends have noticed her lack of boundaries too. I'm at the point where I've lost respect for her and feel completely drained by the friendship.

I'm starting to feel suffocated and don't know how to maintain this friendship. Am I wrong for wanting to distance myself? How do I handle this without creating drama?

TLDR: I'm struggling with my mums erratic moods and general 'nastiness' since moving back in.

I've recently moved back in with my mum at 32 years old. I was made redundant and couldn't afford to live in London.

I am lucky, I get on with my mum very well and I am grateful to have somewhere to live whilst I get back on my feet again. My dad/her husband died a number of years ago and we've been close ever since.

I am struggling with how erratic and dramatic she can be. I am autistic so struggle to not take everything she says at face value/not take everything personally.

Just as some examples she'll go for a walk and come back saying 'I hate this house, I can't believe I moved here, what a stupid decision' and half an hour later it's 'Oh my god this place is amazing, I'm so lucky'.

This happens with most things throughout the day, from her choice of breakfast to her opinion of her partner. She'll go from 'oh he's amazing' to 'what are we doing together' over the space of 10 mins. I stopped getting into in-depth conversations with her about these kind of comments because her opinion changes so much. I simply say 'you tend to live very in the moment, give it a little time and consideration and see how you feel later on'. This tends to work.

I understand she's just working through things, we're both in therapy and I know she's dealing with her own stuff. She has always been like this but we haven't lived together in 15 years.

I am REALLY struggling when it comes to comments about anything directly involving me. I have a plant my best friend gave me when we moved out and my mum just constantly goes 'It's HIDEOUS, it so depressing and reminds me of death'. It's literally a perfectly alive and healthy cheese plant. I suggest to move it and she says I'm being dramatic. I am still unpacking and trying to keep as much in my room because anything of mine causes her so much stress. I met her in town for a coffee yesterday and her comment was 'it's so funny coming back here after London, everyones disabled and weird'. As someone with a disability I just looked at her in shock. 

I guess I feel like most people when they move back in with their folks as adults. Like kids again. I understand it's an adjustment period for her as well, but I don't go around the house saying everything of hers pisses me off. I spent a lot of time as a kid alone and trying to get away from the family, I'm kind of seeing why now.",1,1733303905.0,Millennials,1,1.0,False

Hello everyone! Long story, buckle up.

I'm 31 f, undiagnosed but suspected inattentive type (my country doesn't really do adult diagnosis nor medication). Very prone to shame spirals and isolating myself.

I have an aunt on my mom's side, 60, with who I share a lot of traits. This post is about her. For context, my mom, her older sister died 3yrs ago.

She's always been unapologetically different, and lived successfully outside of the box. She's single and child-free. She taught herself skills that made her a good living, working mostly freelance. However, when she was 45ish, work opportunities dwindled slowly and she never regained her footing. At some point she started living off her savings and never really got another job again. 

Eventually her electricity got cut off and debt went to collectors. She lives in a separate unit in our family home, so we managed to rig a cord for like a lamp and phone/laptop charger. She has no heating nor warm water. I think she's contitioned herself to eat very little food and get by like that. She's proud though and doesn't talk about her issues; and I was too afraid to directly ask how's she living and how to help.

For two years, after mom died, my husband and I tried to get her to come live with us, at least over the winter. She couldn't accept and at some point said that she's the one who messed up and she should dig herself out of this. I reminded her she's the one helping my mom and I (including financially) after I was born; it didn't help. But at least we saw each other regularly, talked, had coffee, ate family lunches. 

Then came my wedding, this past summer. It was lovely, we buzzed around talking to everyone. Afterwards, a friend told they talked and she was sad because mom wasn't there. I feel so guilty not noticing this. 

I think the weddig was the last time we talked or saw her. We tried to call, knock, but no answer. She has our streaming passwords, and we check to see when was she online. Basically that's how we know she's alive. 

I stopped calling at some point, as it reminds me of the period of a couple of years when I was about 12-15, when she didn't really talk to any of us (nothing actually happened, fight or anything, she just didn't want to communicate). My mom was very hurt, but not mad at her, just worried. We slowly reestablished contact afterwards.

Another trigger for me in this whole situation is 2020. It was a perfect storm of different factors for me, I fell into a shame spiral and just ghosted my job and friends. I didn't get out of bed for months and was eaten by guilt. 

The only way I climbed out was getting therapy over zoom. It helped by talking without judgement, but I still don't have specific tools for breaking out the shame spiral (happened a few times after on a smaller scale). On one hand I feel I truly understand where she's at, but on the other I don't know what could work.

For my aunt, we've come to a point where it's literally life or death. I think she's resigned herself to slowly withering away and that she feels she deserves this.

 Do you have any experience or ideas how to at least get her to talk to me, and eventually accepts help? ",4,1733303378.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the exact seven-step strategy I used to grow my LinkedIn following from zero to 100,000 in just 12 months. No team, no paid ads, and no prior experience required. Let's dive in and unlock your LinkedIn potential!

# Step 1: The Digital Detox

The first step to LinkedIn success is counterintuitive but crucial:¬†**remove the noise**. Here's how to do it:

* Unfollow or remove connections that don't align with your goals
* Consider starting a brand new account for a clean slate
* Create a ""dream 100"" list of people you want to connect with

By decluttering your network, you'll eliminate self-comparison and create space for meaningful growth.

# Step 2: Optimize Your Profile

Your profile is your digital first impression. Focus on these three key elements:

# 1. Professional Headshot

* Use a clear, high-quality photo
* Ensure you look approachable
* Choose a solid or non-distracting background

**Pro tip**: Use your smartphone's timer and edit with Canva for a polished look.

# 2. Compelling Headline

Use one of these templates:

1. For those with an offer: ""\[What you do\] for \[who you help\] to \[outcome\]""
2. For those without an offer: ""On a mission to \[goal\] | Sharing content about \[topics\] | Posting about \[journey\]""

# 3. Simple Banner

Contrary to popular advice, opt for a solid color that matches your brand. This allows you to focus on engagement rather than design perfection.

# Step 3: The 500+ Connection Strategy

Achieving 500+ connections is crucial for credibility. Here's how to do it:

1. Find 20-30 active accounts in your niche
2. Comment consistently on their posts
3. Use three types of comments:
   * Personal take
   * Motivational mic drop
   * Humorous meme (if appropriate)

**Key insight**: Commenting builds leverage when you don't have any, exposing you to thousands of new eyeballs daily.

# Step 4: Micro-Niche Your Content

To stand out, follow the ""Rule of One"":

1. Identify your core expertise
2. Break it down into specific components
3. Focus on one micro-niche where you can quickly become a leader

For example, if your expertise is personal branding, you might focus specifically on LinkedIn content creation for B2B professionals.

# Step 5: Create High-Performance Content

Successful content does one (or more) of these three things:

1. Educate
2. Inspire
3. Entertain

For the first 90 days, aim to post 3-5 times a week with:

* 80% educational content
* 20% inspirational content

**Pro tip**: Use visual elements like infographics, carousels, or well-designed graphics to enhance engagement.

# Step 6: Master Visual Rhythm

Optimize your content for skimmability:

* Keep sentences to 8-10 words max
* Use bullet points for easy reading
* Format for mobile viewing

Remember, visual harmony in your writing can significantly boost engagement and credibility.

# Step 7: Build Meaningful Connections

The secret sauce to LinkedIn success is genuine connection:

1. Schedule regular coffee chats or Zoom calls
2. Connect with people at various stages in their journey
3. Offer value in every conversation
4. Collaborate and seek referrals

By consistently showing up and providing value, you'll build a powerful network that propels your growth.

# Conclusion: Your LinkedIn Growth Journey Starts Now

By implementing this seven-step strategy, you're setting yourself up for exponential growth on LinkedIn. Remember, consistency is key. Post regularly, engage authentically, and always focus on providing value to your network.

Are you ready to take your LinkedIn presence to the next level? Start applying these strategies today, and watch your influence soar. Don't forget to track your progress and adjust your approach as needed. Your journey to becoming a LinkedIn influencer begins now!",1,1733303066.0,MPGONE,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------

When you consider that many people are constantly searching for ways to improve their health, the idea of a 5-day fast can be quite appealing. This practice, often thought of as extreme, comes with numerous potential benefits that might surprise you. Let's dive into the various advantages of a 5-day fast and discover how it could enhance your overall well-being.

### Enhanced Mental Clarity

One of the first benefits you may notice during a 5-day fast is an increase in mental clarity. When you abstain from food, your body switches from using glucose for energy to using ketones. This shift can boost cognitive function and clarity, allowing you to think more clearly and focus better. Many followers of fasting report feeling more alert and productive during their fasting periods.

### Improved Weight Management

If weight loss is a goal for you, fasting for five days can be an effective strategy. Here‚Äôs how it works:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Fat Utilization:** During fasting, your body consumes stored fat for energy, which may help with weight loss.
- **Reduced Caloric Intake:** By not eating for five days, you significantly reduce your total caloric intake, leading to a caloric deficit.
- **Metabolic Boost:** Some studies suggest that short-term fasting may elevate your metabolic rate, helping to burn calories more efficiently.

### Cellular Repair and Autophagy

A fasting period of five days can kickstart the process known as autophagy. This is where your body removes damaged cells and regenerates new ones. By encouraging this cellular repair, fasting may play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases. This process allows your body to rejuvenate and maintain optimal function.

### Enhanced Immune Function

Another notable benefit of a 5-day fast is the potential enhancement of your immune system. Research indicates that fasting can lead to increased production of essential immune cells. Here‚Äôs why this is important:

- **Reduced Inflammation:** Fasting helps decrease inflammation in the body, improving overall immune response.
- **Cellular Regeneration:** After fasting, your body may have improved capabilities to fight off infections and heal from illnesses.

### Improved Insulin Sensitivity

Longer fasting periods have been linked with improved insulin sensitivity. When insulin sensitivity increases, your body can use insulin more effectively. This is particularly beneficial for those at risk of type 2 diabetes or anyone who has concerns about blood sugar levels. Enhanced insulin sensitivity can also contribute to better overall metabolic health.

### Potential Mental Health Benefits

Fasting can also have an impact on your emotional state. Many people report feeling more balanced and less anxious while fasting. This might be due to hormonal shifts that occur when you refrain from eating. For instance, increased levels of norepinephrine can help improve mood and focus, bridging a connection between fasting and mental health.

### Spiritual Awareness and Mindfulness

In addition to physical and mental benefits, a 5-day fast can be a time for spiritual reflection and mindfulness. Many people use this practice to connect with themselves on a deeper level. You might find the time spent without food offers moments for meditation or self-discovery, helping to enhance your overall life satisfaction.

### Considerations Before Starting a Fast

While a 5-day fast can offer many benefits, it‚Äôs essential to approach this practice with careful consideration. Here are some tips:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Consult a Professional:** Speak with a healthcare provider before starting any extended fasting, especially if you have existing health conditions.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water is crucial to support your body during the fasting period.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel and adjust your plan if necessary. If you experience severe discomfort, it‚Äôs wise to stop.

Engaging in a 5-day fast can lead to remarkable health benefits, from weight management to improved mental clarity, and may even foster a greater sense of well-being. Remember to approach this journey with care and consideration to ensure that you make the most out of your fasting experience.

How a Short-Term Fast Affects Your Body and Mind
------------------------------------------------

Embarking on a short-term fast can have significant effects on both your body and mind. Many people are drawn to this practice for various reasons, including health benefits and spiritual growth. If you're curious about how a fast can impact your well-being, let's explore some of the positive changes you may experience.

### The Physical Benefits of Fasting

One of the most notable advantages of a 5-day fast is its ability to enhance bodily health. Here are some key benefits:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improved Metabolism:** A short-term fast can help your body reset its metabolism. Your body shifts from using glucose to burning fat for fuel, potentially aiding weight loss.
- **Cellular Repair:** Fasting triggers autophagy, a process where the body removes damaged cells and regenerates new ones. This can lead to better overall organ function.
- **Blood Sugar Regulation:** Short-term fasting may improve insulin sensitivity. This means your body can manage blood sugar levels more effectively, which is vital for preventing diabetes.
- **Enhanced Heart Health:** Studies suggest that fasting can lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, decreasing the risk of heart disease.
- **Boosted Immune System:** Engaging in a fast can rejuvenate your immune system. Some research indicates that fasting can improve immune cell function and reduce inflammation.

### Mental Clarity and Focus

Fasting does not only reap benefits for your body; it can also significantly enhance your mental faculties:

- **Increased Focus:** As your body adapts to fasting, many people report sharp mental clarity. This can lead to improved concentration and productivity in daily tasks.
- **Mood Improvement:** A lack of food can sometimes increase endorphins in the brain, leading to feelings of happiness and euphoria. This change in mood can be motivating and uplifting.
- **Spiritual Insights:** For many, fasting is a spiritual journey. This process often allows for deeper reflection, connecting with oneself, and exploring personal beliefs.

### Prepare Yourself for a Fast

Planning is essential for a successful fasting experience. Here are a few tips to help you prepare:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Consult a Doctor:** Before starting any fasting plan, especially one that lasts days, consult with a healthcare provider. They can help you understand if it's suitable for your health condition.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water during your fast. Keeping hydrated will help you feel better physically and mentally.
- **Gradually Reduce Food Intake:** Before the fast, consider reducing your caloric intake slowly. This can help your body adapt to the fasting phase more effortlessly.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel during your fast. If you experience severe discomfort, it‚Äôs essential to break the fast safely.

### Possible Challenges When Fasting

While the benefits are appealing, fasting may also pose some challenges:

- **Hunger Pangs:** It's common to feel hungry while fasting. Try to distract yourself with activities to help cope with these feelings.
- **Fatigue:** Initially, you might feel low energy. As your body adjusts, this usually improves. Resting and light activity can aid in this transition.
- **Social Aspects:** Fasting can affect social gatherings. You might feel out of place at events centered around food. Planning ahead can help you manage these situations.

### Personal Growth and Mindfulness

Engaging in a short-term fast can be an enlightening experience. You may find yourself becoming more mindful of your eating habits and lifestyle choices. Many people report a heightened sense of awareness surrounding food, leading to healthier habits long after the fast ends. This shift not only benefits your health but can also enrich your overall quality of life.

A short-term fast offers numerous physical and mental benefits. Whether you are seeking a boost in energy, better mental clarity, or a deeper connection to your spirituality, fasting can pave the way for improved well-being. Just remember to prepare adequately, listen to your body, and embrace the journey!

The Science Behind Intermittent Fasting and Weight Loss
-------------------------------------------------------

Intermittent fasting is gaining popularity as a method for weight loss and overall health improvement. But what is the science behind it? Understanding the biological mechanisms at play can help you see how this fasting approach can aid in weight management.

At its core, intermittent fasting works by cycling between periods of eating and fasting. This can be done in various ways, such as the 16/8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window. Another popular approach is the 5:2 diet, which allows for normal eating five days a week while limiting calorie intake for two non-consecutive days. However, regardless of the method chosen, the effects on the body share similar mechanisms.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Role of Insulin

One of the primary factors in weight loss is the hormone insulin. When you eat, your pancreas releases insulin to help move glucose (sugar) from your bloodstream into your cells for energy. Frequent eating can cause insulin levels to stay elevated, which may lead to fat storage and difficulty in losing weight.

When you practice intermittent fasting, insulin levels decrease during the fasting period. Lower insulin levels facilitate fat burning, as your body starts to use stored fat for energy instead of relying solely on incoming calories. This hormonal change is crucial in aiding weight loss.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Cellular Repair and Autophagy

Besides insulin regulation, intermittent fasting triggers processes that support cellular health. When you're fasting, your body initiates autophagy, a type of cellular cleanup. It removes damaged cells and proteins and helps in replacing them with new, healthy cells.

Autophagy has several benefits, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Enhanced cellular function
- Improved energy metabolism
- Reduced inflammation

This process is not only beneficial for weight loss but also promotes overall health, potentially reducing the risk of various diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.

### Impact on Metabolism

Intermittent fasting can also give your metabolism a boost. Research shows that fasting can increase the production of norepinephrine, a hormone that heightens fat breakdown and elevates your metabolic rate. Some studies indicate that short-term fasting can increase metabolism by up to 14%. This thermometer effect can assist with weight loss by making your body more efficient at burning calories.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Psychological Benefits

Psychologically, intermittent fasting can help change your relationship with food. By creating a structured eating schedule, you can develop better control over your appetite and reduce emotional eating. Many people find that they spend less time obsessing about food and more time focusing on their meals and enjoying them. The sense of accomplishment from successfully fasting can also improve motivation towards healthier habits.

### Potential Weight Loss Results

Numerous studies have shown that intermittent fasting can lead to significant weight loss. Participants practicing intermittent fasting often report a reduction in body weight and body fat. Depending on the fasting method and individual adherence, many experience a weight loss of about 3-8% in just a few weeks.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Moreover, it‚Äôs worth noting that intermittent fasting does not necessarily require a drastic change in your diet. While the quality of the foods you eat remains essential for overall health, the flexibility of intermittent fasting allows you to incorporate it with various dietary approaches, making it sustainable long-term.

Intermittent fasting into your lifestyle may enhance your weight loss journey. Along with its hormonal benefits and metabolic boosts, it also engages your mind and helps you develop a healthier relationship with food. Whether you choose the 16/8 method or the 5:2 approach, the science supporting your choices can empower you on your path to health.

- **Drink Regularly:** Carry a water bottle and set reminders to drink throughout the day.

### Managing Hunger and Cravings

It‚Äôs normal to experience hunger and cravings during a fast. To help manage these feelings:

- **Distract Yourself:** Keep busy with activities like reading, walking, or hobbies to take your mind off hunger.

### Staying Active

Physical activity during a 5-day fast can be beneficial, but it should be balanced. Here's how to approach exercise:

- **Opt for Light Exercise:** Engage in gentle activities like yoga, stretching, or walking. Avoid high-intensity workouts that can drain your energy.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel. If you're too fatigued, it‚Äôs okay to rest more than usual.

### Breaking the Fast Safely

How you break your fast matters just as much as the fasting period itself. To do it right:

- **Start Small:** Begin with light foods like broth, smoothies, or fruit. Avoid large meals immediately after fasting.
- **Gradually Reintroduce Foods:** Over a day or two, slowly reintroduce regular foods to help your digestive system readjust.
- **Monitor Your Body's Response:** Watch for any discomfort or digestive issues and adjust your intake accordingly.

Completing a 5-day fast can be a life-changing experience. With proper preparation, hydration, and mindfulness, you can navigate the challenges of fasting. Remember to listen to your body throughout the process and break your fast with care.

Personal Stories: Transformative Experiences with Extended Fasting
------------------------------------------------------------------

Many individuals embark on fasting journeys for various reasons, leading to truly transformative experiences. Extended fasting, in particular, can deepen self-awareness and catalyze significant changes. By exploring personal stories, we can uncover the power behind a structured fasting regimen and its potential to transform lives.

Take Sarah, for example, a 35-year-old mother of two who struggled with weight management and emotional eating. After hearing about a 5-day fasting program, she decided to try it. The first few days were challenging, filled with hunger pangs and cravings. However, as she pushed through, Sarah began to notice an unexpected clarity of mind. ‚ÄúEach day, I felt lighter, not just in body but also in spirit,‚Äù she recalls. This new mental clarity helped her focus on her long-term goals, sparking inspiration to pursue a hobby she had long neglected: painting.

Another transformative experience comes from Mark, a busy executive who often relied on caffeine and sugar for energy. After a few weeks of feeling sluggish, he committed to a 5-day fast to reset his body. The decision was daunting but necessary. Within the first couple of days, Mark noted negative feelings about his work stress easing. ‚ÄúIt was as if removing food removed the noise in my head,‚Äù he shares. This fasting experience empowered him to evaluate his lifestyle choices and work-life balance decisively.

The physical benefits of extended fasting are compelling. A study illustrated that after five days of fasting, the body engages in a process called autophagy, where it begins to clear out damaged cells, contributing to overall health. This was evident in Rachel‚Äôs story. After undergoing a 5-day fast, she reported feeling more energetic, and even her chronic joint pain seemed to lessen. Rachel stated, ‚ÄúI could move with such ease; it was life-changing!‚Äù Such accounts underscore how fasting not only impacts our minds but also rejuvenates our physical bodies.

Extended fasting can also break emotional and psychological barriers. Jamie, a fitness instructor, shared how a 5-day fast shifted her relationship with food. Previously, she viewed food strictly as a means of fueling workouts, leading to an unhealthy cycle. ‚ÄúDuring the fast, I realized that food is not my enemy, but it‚Äôs meant to nourish me,‚Äù she says. By the end of the experience, Jamie approached meal planning with a renewed attitude, focusing on what truly nourished her body rather than merely counting calories.

For many, the community aspect of fasting plays a crucial role in their journey. Online support groups have sprung up where individuals share experiences, challenges, and victories. Here is a short list of benefits participants often highlight:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Accountability:** Connecting with others provides support and motivation.
- **Shared Knowledge:** Group discussions reveal tips on how to best manage hunger and cravings.
- **Enhanced Motivation:** Hearing others‚Äô transformative stories inspires personal commitment.
- **Emotional Support:** Sharing struggles helps alleviate feelings of isolation during tough days.

It's not just the physical benefits that attract people to fasting; it's the emotional shift that can occur throughout the process. For Angela, the experience was cathartic. She had always turned to food during tough times, masking her feelings instead of addressing them. The 5-day fast forced her to confront her emotional traumas head-on. ‚ÄúI was giving myself a chance to grieve and reflect,‚Äù she avows, ‚Äúand it was liberating to put that baggage down.‚Äù

**it is evident that the narratives surrounding extended fasting illustrate a complex tapestry of transformation.** Every story is unique, revealing that while the physical advantages of a 5-day fast can be compelling, the emotional and mental transformations are just as profound. Whether it‚Äôs achieving clarity, improving energy levels, or breaking unhealthy associations with food, the journey of fasting is one steeped in self-discovery and empowerment. If you‚Äôre considering a fasting regimen, remember that you‚Äôre not alone. Countless others have walked this path and emerged stronger, more enlightened, and ready to embrace life with renewed vigor.

### Conclusion

The journey of undertaking a 5-day fast can be both enlightening and transformative. As we've explored the various benefits, it‚Äôs clear that this practice extends beyond just weight loss. You may find improvements in mental clarity and focus, as well as a sense of emotional well-being that can boost your daily life.

We‚Äôre all in our late 30s. Nelly moved away couple of hours away a few years ago while Kate and I live close-ish to each other.

Recently, Nelly was going to be back in our area for a few days so we were all going to catch up on Saturday. At first, Nelly asked what we wanted to do. I suggested brunch but Nelly said she was already planning to have brunch on Friday (not sure why that mattered) and wanted to do dinner instead. Kate said she couldn‚Äôt do dinner so Nelly agreed to lunch.

Nelly told us to pick a place so I picked Cafe 1 between Kate and me. The next day, Nelly suggested Cafe 2 in a completely different location as it was near a store she wanted to visit. Kate said the store was no longer there.

The next day, Nelly then suggested Cafe 3 in a different location again. Except it wasn‚Äôt a cafe, it was a retail coffee shop that sold some pastries. I suggested we just go with Cafe 1 as I wanted a place with more substantial food to avoid triggering my pregnancy nausea (it‚Äôs been a really rough pregnancy for me). Nelly said she wasn‚Äôt too fussed about the food and sent a picture of the menu listing more pastries.

Later on, Nelly finally says she wanted somewhere close to public transport. I was already frustrated at this point because I felt like she should have communicated that sooner rather than randomly listing cafes but I said, ‚ÄúOK then. Let‚Äôs do Cafe 4 - it‚Äôs opposite the train station and it has a menu with good brunch food.‚Äù

After a few hours, Nelly responded with ‚Äúargh. Buses are replacing trains on Saturday. I don‚Äôt want to catch a bus.‚Äù (Basically, the trains were down so they would be replaced by buses that would take the same route instead).

At this point, I just gave up and said that trying to plan this brunch was proving more difficult than it should be and was stressing me out. I said I‚Äôd just skip brunch but the two of them were welcome to catch up by themselves. Nelly responded by saying she was just trying to find a convenient location for everyone and that she remembers also being nauseous and uncomfortable during pregnancy and that she didn‚Äôt want to stress me out. (But I felt like she was just trying to pick somewhere that suited her without considering anyone else‚Äôs needs.)

I didn‚Äôt bother responding and the group chat has since died. AITA for getting frustrated and backing out of the plans?

Chapter 1: Wolves and Sheep
¬†
‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd end up like this,‚Äù John Richards muttered, his voice trembling as it broke the silence. ‚ÄúAlcohol‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs taken everything from me.‚Äù

The confession hung in the air. The room was silent, thick with tension. The circle of faces around him remained still. Their eyes bore into him with a mix of empathy and concern. Linda, his wife, sat beside him, gripping his hands. Her eyes were red-rimmed, but she held back the tears.

‚ÄúI should‚Äôve died that morning,‚Äù John went on. ‚ÄúThe wreck‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt just a wake-up call‚Äîit was a miracle I survived.‚Äù Heads nodded in understanding within the group, as if his words had struck a chord.

‚ÄúI was driving to a job interview,‚Äù John said, the memory pulling him back. ‚ÄúIt was raining. The roads were wet. I was lost in thought.‚Äù He hesitated, the word hanging in the air, before he continued. ‚ÄúThen, out of nowhere, this 18-wheeler slammed into me. It felt like a freight train.‚Äù
John lowered his gaze to the floor, his voice dropping to a near whisper, ‚ÄúAnd then, everything went black.‚Äù

David Cole, seated across from John, nodded slowly, his expression one of concern. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here, John. That counts for something,‚Äù he said.
John looked up to meet David‚Äôs gaze. David‚Äôs eyes were hollow, cold. John continued, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can ever be the man I was before. I don‚Äôt know if I can provide for my family again.‚Äù
Linda tightened her grip on his hands, her voice steady, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get through this, John. We have each other, and we have our faith.‚Äù John nodded, but the words offered little comfort.

Maggie Cole, seated beside David, leaned forward and said with a soft, reassuring smile, ‚ÄúFaith can carry us through the darkest times, John. You‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù But her words were calculated, every syllable measured. She shot David a quick glance, barely noticeable, but enough to confirm they were both thinking the same thing. They weren‚Äôt here to comfort John.
David and Maggie Cole weren‚Äôt the broken souls they pretended to be. They were private investigators, hired by Accelerate Insurance to find something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat could discredit John Richards. Accelerate wasn‚Äôt about to pay out a million-dollar claim without a fight, and the company had hired the Coles to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt have to.

David and Maggie had spent weeks ingratiating themselves with the group, playing their parts with Oscar-worthy performances. David was the repentant sinner, a man who had ‚Äúgambled his life away,‚Äù but had found his way back through faith. Maggie played the supportive wife, who had stood by him through thick and thin, her own battles with depression and painkillers adding to the narrative. They were convincing, and no one in the room suspected a thing.

As the group continued to share their stories, the room seemed to shrink with every word spoken. It was a simple room, tucked away in the back of Grace Hill Bible Church, far from the grand sanctuary. An intimate circle of chairs, a table with a coffee pot and styrofoam cups. The lighting was dim, creating an atmosphere of safety, where secrets and burdens could be shared.

But since John and Maggie had joined the group, the room had become something else: A stage where John‚Äôs words were being quietly cataloged, recorded, and stored away for later use. As the meeting wrapped up with a prayer, John and Linda lingered, speaking softly with a few others before they left. David and Maggie hung back as well, watching them with expressions of sympathy. But once the room emptied, their masks dropped.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre close,‚Äù Maggie said, her tone icy. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs still holding back.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur next meeting is ‚ÄòStep 5‚ÄîConfession.‚Äô That‚Äôll be our best shot at getting what we need. If we handle it right, he might admit to drinking and driving on the morning of the wreck. We need to nudge him carefully, though. He can‚Äôt suspect anything.‚Äù

The following week, as the group sat down, Pastor Greg stood at the front. He waited a moment, letting the silence settle. ‚ÄúTonight, we begin Step 5: Confession,‚Äù Pastor Greg said. ‚ÄúThis is a key moment. We confess to God, to ourselves, and to each other the exact nature of our sins.‚Äù

He paused, looking around the room. ‚ÄúThe Revive program isn‚Äôt just a support group. We follow the twelve steps, but with scripture at the core. Each step brings us closer to God as we fight our battles.‚Äù

Pastor Greg continued, his voice calm but firm. ‚ÄúStep 5 is about laying it all out. It‚Äôs not just about admitting wrongs. It‚Äôs about freeing yourself to move forward.‚Äù

He bowed his head. ‚ÄúLet us pray. Lord, Your word reminds us that if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, You are faithful to forgive us. Help us to be honest tonight, trusting in Your promise of forgiveness. Amen.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmen,‚Äù the group echoed in unison as they lifted their heads. Tension immediately filled the air, a weight settling over the room.

Pastor Greg looked around, meeting each person‚Äôs gaze before speaking again. ‚ÄúWho would like to start us off with their confession?‚Äù he asked, his tone gentle, but expectant.
A woman named Carol raised her hand, her voice trembling as she began, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been stealing from my job,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúSmall things at first‚Äîoffice supplies, snacks. But it‚Äôs escalated. I took money from the petty cash, and I can‚Äôt seem to stop. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm addicted to the thrill of getting away with it.‚Äù The group listened in silence, absorbing her words as she confessed her sins.
One by one, the confessions continued around the circle. Each person shared their struggles‚Äîaddictions, lies, betrayals. The tension grew with each admission, the weight of unspoken secrets pressing down on the room as they inched closer to John.

Finally, it was his turn. David and Maggie were particularly attentive that night. Their eyes rarely left John, watching every movement, every hesitation. They could sense his fear, and they knew it was time to push.

‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù Maggie said softly, her voice almost a whisper, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt let go of what‚Äôs weighing you down, it‚Äôll consume you.‚Äù

John looked up, meeting her gaze. There was a flicker of something‚Äîhesitation, suspicion‚Äîbut it passed quickly, replaced by resignation. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he replied, his voice hollow. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ alcohol has destroyed my life. It took my job, my health, and almost my family. That morning, I was driving to a job interview, hoping it would be my chance to turn things around.‚Äù

He paused, the memory painful. ‚ÄúThe roads were slick. I was stressed, a little distracted, thinking about what would happen if I didn‚Äôt get the job. Then, this 18-wheeler slammed into me. Everything went black.‚Äù

David leaned forward, his tone gentle but probing, ‚ÄúJohn, were you drinking that morning?‚Äù
John hesitated, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt drunk, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking.‚Äù

Maggie pressed a little further, ‚ÄúSo you weren‚Äôt drinking before the accident?‚Äù

John shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt drunk,‚Äù he repeated, his voice wavering with uncertainty.
Linda intervened, ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt drinking,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been doing his best.‚Äù

Pastor Greg, sensing the rising tension, nodded and said, ‚ÄúThank you, John, for sharing. We‚Äôre all here to support each other, and your honesty helps us all.‚Äù

At the end of the meeting, Pastor Greg led the group in prayer, thanking God for the strength shown by everyone. Once the room was empty, David slipped his phone from his pocket, stopping the recording he had made of the meeting. He turned to Maggie. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù he said quietly, ‚ÄúWe got what we need.‚Äù

Mike McDowell arrived at Pierce, Porter & Reed for his first day as a lawyer. The office was everything he‚Äôd imagined‚Äîglass, marble, and a 38th-floor view of downtown Houston. Sarah, the front desk assistant, led him down the hall, her Louis Vuittons clicking on the marble floor, the red bottoms reflecting off the white tile surface.

Mike couldn‚Äôt help but notice the paintings on the walls‚Äîscenes of Texas life. The longhorns and oil rigs sprouting out of dusty fields looked familiar. He strained to remember the artist‚Äôs name. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen these before,‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúIs it Guy Harvey? No, that‚Äôs the fish guy. Maybe ‚ÄòG. Harvey‚Äô?‚Äù He had lived in Texas his entire life.

Sarah‚Äôs voice broke through his thoughts. She stopped at a pair of heavy double doors. ‚ÄúWelcome to The War Room,‚Äù she said, pushing them open with dramatic flair. Inside, the room buzzed with energy. Lawyers crowded around a long table, papers and trial exhibits scattered everywhere. Matt Pierce, the managing partner, stood at the head.

‚ÄúMike, good to see you,‚Äù Matt said, motioning him over. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a big one today.‚Äù

Mike joined the group, feeling the intensity in the room. Matt briefed him on the Richards case‚Äîthe lawsuit against Accelerate Insurance‚Äôs truck driver with a big policy after a serious truck wreck on the South Gulf Freeway. Liability seemed clear, but plaintiff John Richards‚Äôs damages were steep, and Accelerate didn‚Äôt want to pay.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got recordings,‚Äù Matt said, his tone flat. ‚ÄúPrivate investigators went undercover in a church support group the plaintiff and his wife attended. Got them talking about the accident. It‚Äôs dirty, and we certainly did not know about or approve it, but it‚Äôs what we have.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù Mike asked.

Matt replied, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to find a way to use it. The plaintiff has a history of alcoholism. He may have been under the influence at the time of the wreck. Listen to the recordings. Find a way to discredit the guy and stir up doubt about who caused the accident. Make the jury think twice about believing his story. Create a doubt, create an out. Remember that, Mike. The plaintiff bears the burden of proof.‚Äù

Mike nodded, ‚ÄúCreate a doubt, create an out,‚Äù he repeated to himself. He knew this was his chance to prove himself. As he took the thumb drive with the audio recordings and sat down to work, he felt the weight of the responsibility on his shoulders.

His ambition to find his father's bones was never accomplished, despite how close it seemed.

His son, on the other hand, cared not for his father's bones or his grandfather's bones. He cared only about turning his father's fortune into something even greater. A zeeside mansion with a comfortable retirement fund. So he bought himself a frigate, set out to an unfamiliar zee, and got to work.

Coffee and romance books were constantly being traded.  
Zee monsters and pirates sunk below the waves from the might of his ship's cannons.  
Saucy love affairs were had, be they with ship-doctors or pirate-poets.  
An underwater cigar was made.  
A chess game was won.  
The Fathomking got an island of rats.  
Tomb colonists were entertained.  
A very large mushroom got to spread a bit more.  
A secret about those curious island-bound mailmen was uncovered.  
A serpent was trapped in an engine, and red science was dabbled with, but the grander schemes of certain officers never came to their fullest (even if we learned a bit about Salt along the way).  
London Supremacy was near absolute, if only because losing access to steady fuel source was counter to maximizing longterm profits.

There were many more stories left half-finished, and we never even tried for the surface, but that's for another captain to deal with at another time. For now, it's time to rack up an impossible restaurant bill.

In my (30F) line of work, it‚Äôs very common to need to have coffee chats with folks in order to get a new job so I‚Äôve been having a lot of these Zoom calls. Today I had one with a guy (28M) who I was talking to with both of our cameras off and the conversation was very nice, like I left it thinking he was a great guy, but I had actually not even taken a look at his LinkedIn yet. When I did after the call, I saw his profile picture and realized that I was incredibly attracted to him. I found more pictures of him via looking at his Facebook, and saw that it listed him as single, and I think he is exactly my type. I sent him a thank you note after the call as you always do but I sent it around 10:30 PM and he responded very quickly afterwards. While I know he‚Äôs a hard-working professional and he probably works late nights often, the timing of that response felt sort of intimate and I ended up adding him on LinkedIn afterwards and he accepted me that evening as well.

So on Sunday, we came back from the market with our 9 month old baby, groceries, and a beverage we ordered from Starbucks. Obviously our hands were full coming out from the car and walking to the apartment. Bf carried groceries and diaper bag in while I carried our baby and coffee in. He opened the apartment door and I came in first with the baby and the drink. We don‚Äôt wear shoes inside for obvious reasons so I always take my shoes off first before anything then go do what I need to go do. Since I had the baby in one hand and drink in the other, I put the coffee down for a moment on our table we have at the entrance while I got the little one situated. Other than taking off shoes first, my priority is always making sure she is taken care of, everything else can wait a few minutes. So, I put her in her crib so I can go help my bf out with the groceries i.e. unpacking them and putting them away. 

So here is where we butted heads. Since he placed the two grocery bags on the floor, he placed the diaper bag on the table next to the coffee. Once he placed the bags on the floor, he then moved the diaper bag from the front entrance table knocking over my coffee and spilling it all over the floor making a huge mess. He then proceeded to blame me for placing my drink there. I then told him he should be cautious and be more aware of his surroundings. He then stated that he has told me several times to not leave drinks there but 1. he has not and 2. I wasn‚Äôt leaving it there, I put it there for a moment while I placed our baby down safely. There is a table there so why wouldn‚Äôt I put the drink down on that table for a moment? He then said that he shouldn‚Äôt have to be careful because there shouldn‚Äôt be drinks placed there. However I think that is so unfair because just because you think there shouldn‚Äôt be said things there doesn‚Äôt mean that it will be like that all the time. I wouldn‚Äôt just carelessly move an item off anywhere without making sure I‚Äôm not knocking over things along the way. I feel like that is common sense, being aware of your surroundings, but he doesn‚Äôt see it that way. Can someone see where I am coming from? Or do you agree with him?

We both met in clg 2nd year as 1st year was in covid lockdown. I am a Hindu and she is from a different faith. For us, it was love at first sight but it took time to realize those feelings. Our common friends warned me about her as her family is very traditional but I wanted to hear it from her so I asked her out on a date. Had a good talk with coffee. I asked her generally will her parents accept if she liked somebody from the other faith and she told me that she can convince her parents. Eventually we got in a relationship and she admitted to liking me too from the first time we met. I was very serious about her and had planned everything from impressing her parents and doing everything in my power to be liked by her parents. I always felt really protective of her even before we started dating.

I regularly went to the gym to look good, I studied hard and even started working part-time and investing to earn some money for our future. We both loved each other and even lost our virginity to each other in 3rd year. We shared everything with each other, there were no secrets between us. We both respected each other's faith and I told her I will never ask her to change her faith or change her diet for me because I like everything about her. In our college placements, we both got placed. I cracked a 20+ LPA SDE job and she unfortunately got less than she deserved around 4.5 LPA but even if she didn't get a job I would have taken care of everything. We both went to different cities for work around January. I surprised her by visiting her in April.

Everything was going perfect then around June, she started talking less to me and even started avoiding me, eventually I asked her what's wrong and she told me that she knew that things will have to end between us one day because her parents will never accept a Hindu guy. I asked her why she is already giving up and she told me that she always knew but hid this from me because she loved me. I was angry. I felt like my world has shattered. I asked her to take her time and think about this and not rush her decision. She started responding hours after my texts and sometimes not replying at all.

Humanity's most popular drink is Cola, which is spiced water brought to a boil to meld the flavors and then chilled with ice while infused with water from a carbon spring. 

While it is most simple, the best things usually are. 

Which perfectly encapsulates Humanity. 

Simple yet remarkable. 

Their food of course can have many complex preparations but none to the degree of a 20 day process for 30 grams of finished product. 

That seems to be their main strength, good product at a fast pace with simple processes. 

Then there is tea, which you think is simple, and it is, but the process is highly tedious in keeping the leaves perfect. 

This is because tea leaves can turn into different types by either mixing or aging the leaves in isolated places, such as green and black tea being made from the same tea leaves. 

Cucumber water or Lemon water is another unique one, normally considered a peasant drink, Humanity's elite seems to enjoy these simple fruit slices who depart flavor and freshness into the water they are soaked into. 

The number of drinks from Humanity alone can equal the number of drinks from 12 species combined. 

Note that Humanity just came out of nearly 90 years of endless warfare and their recovering economy from the strain is slowly revealing the economic and agricultural powerhouse that is Humanity with just their drinks alone. 

Thousands of Markets are bidding hundreds upon thousands of credits per PALLET of Human drinks to put in their shops to meet customer demand. 

A demand that expands the farther Humanity's military economy reaches, flexing the ability for their sodas to enjoy a nice cold Soda on desert planets to a hot can of coffee on ice worlds. 

The donations of these soldiers to refugees has only further increased demand as these refugees after their planet is freed with the Human Federation's help cannot help but want to relive the delicious flavor of various sodas given to them as children by their saviors. 

This has nicknamed Human Drinks as ""Galactic Ambrosia""

Although a large number of lawsuits has sparked up from aliens addicted to energy drinks causing kidney stones harder than Plasteel Armor.

Yesterday, I was at a coffee shop making some notes and doing homework that I got in my previous class.
Another person in the coffee shop saw that I was practicing Chinese, came up to me and wanted to do a bit of a language exchange...right there my brain stopped working.
It was like I recognised the words that they were saying but I had no idea what any of it meant.


Do you guys have any advice of how I can improve that?
I practice flashcards and reading every day and even meet with a language partner every now and then but as soon as a random conversation pops up I go blank.
Any advice would be great!!",6,1733300003.0,ChineseLanguage,4,0.75,False
