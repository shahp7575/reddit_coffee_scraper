Many friends, even my roommates told me that going on even a coffee date feels like owing them something. One of my friends warned me not to let them know that I'm virgin or never been in a relationship like why is it so tough?

I'm 22 now. I do wanna spend my time with someone but in a meaningful way. I tried talking to a guy and all those things I have been told and seen happened to my friends, makes me feel very repulsive. Honestly, I really wanna do date him but without doing any mental gymnastics about who else might he be talking to and all.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

My goal is to make a post of some of the best Petrol Stations in Luxembourg!! I def have some favorites and I wanted to share some of them and write a few words. I havent been to every petrol station so if you have a favorite let me know so I can go by and check it out!!

10. The aral in Engeldorf. unkomplicated, nothing expensive here..might be busy in the mornings  
9 The gulf in Ettelbrück on Ave d Allies. Good snacks..kinda hard to park here sometimes. Driving out of this place can be hard the street is very busy sometimes

8 Total on the merscherbierg..they have good snacks here and good sortiment of ice i the summer..it is well worth a visit

7 Shell rte de Luxemburg Bissen They have a nice sortiment of ice and good snacks. easy parking here and easy to drive in and out no problem..lots of drinks and generally good.

Now we start getting into the next level of petrol stations. I know my list starts out heavy around diekirch and mersch...so lets go

6 the shell station in Niederanven rue gabriell lipmann..Great station right off the autobahn ..easy access pums and snacks are ok..coffee is pretty good here too.

the petrol stations def worth a stop

5 Aral simonis plaza on Potaschbierg worth a stop great snacks. nice parking the toilets are clean...always worth a stop or better yet if you are out working this place is a good place to stop for your lunch

4 Total energies Pontpierre..Great parking easy access in and out you get the best snacks and large amount of drinks and ice!! toilets clean

3 Esso rue Charles de Gaul in Esch zur Alzette this place actually gave me teh idea to find the best petrol station in Luxemburg..I really enjoy the Pizza here teh parking is not the greatest but it worth a stop

2 Total energies in Lorentzweiler... the snacks here are really good and they have a nice collection of ice in the freezer..always a good place to stop if you do not want gas station food there is also some guy in the back with a fritten bude...good lunch stop parking not too good but overall always a good stop.

1 Gulf Shoppi in Junglinster...right off the road this place is clean and has good snacks. The coffee is good..I stop here just to stop here and I love it

**Ultimate Petrol station in Luxemburg in My most Humble of opinions is the Esso on Sennigerberg..this place is next level...really good food and there is some parking but it is pretty full lots of drinks and ice this is the place to go to if you are in the area..**

so that is my list...I know there is one more at least that I did not put on my list...I couldnt find it on the map but it is in the north direction feulen..but I got tired of looking on the map to find it ..I am going to take a ride out there to see if I can find it. I would like to know what you think of my list and I would like to find some new good places to stop and snack. I deliberatly did not add the Shell on the A3..it is ok. it has a Mcdonalds and starbucks and all that stuff but it is not a place I make an effort to stop at",1,1770186041.0,Luxembourg,0,1.0,False

1qvgs4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostStoryGuysPodcast/comments/1qvgs4p/activity_in_my_house_kicking_up/,Activity in my house kicking up,"So, I'm the listener who sent in the story about having the absolute shit scared out of me by the reflection of a woman in the coffee pot. There's also another spirit in the house that I refer to as George, who has been here since I bought the place 15 years ago.  
  
I've been clearing out my house to put it up for sale, and things have been happening a lot. There's probably been more things in the last 3 months than there have been in the last 10 years. It seems to center around the basement.

This is an old house for the area; built in 1922 and at one point, part of a farm. Fun fact: when they tore up the sidewalks to replace them, the workers found a really big, rusty old horseshoe under mine. When I moved in, there were a couple of things in the basement...an old wood washtub and washboard and an ironing board. 

I should add here that I do have some sensitivity, but it all seems to rely on my hands. I get much stronger feelings/impressions from things if I touch them. I tried once to move the old ironing board and honestly, I couldn't bring myself to touch it. I almost felt like I was trying to push my hands through mud when I reached to grab it. The feeling couldn't have been clearer: I was not meant to touch those things and they did not belong to me. I haven't touched them since. They'll stay here when I leave.

There are also a lot of old cabinets in the basement, and about two weeks ago, I went downstairs to do laundry and found every single cabinet door open. When I closed them, because seeing them open was increasing my feeling of uneasiness, they felt...unpleasant to touch. Like...just gross. They made me feel the same type of revulsion I'd feel accidentally touching wet food in the sink while washing dishes. The entire time I was down there, the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and I felt like I was being watched.

The room I'm sitting in right now has some interesting stuff on the shelf that runs all the way around the room. One of those things is a model skeleton I got when I was in college. It's fully articulated except for the fingers and toes.   
I came home from work and the skeleton had been moved from the corner where it normally is to being seated on the chair several feet away. The chair is below and several feet to the right of where the skeleton sits. There's no way it would've fallen that way; it would've just fallen straight down. There's no way my cats could've knocked it over, and even if they had, it seems really unlikely it'd land sitting upright.

Then there are the dimes.

I am finding dimes \*everywhere.\* On the kitchen counter. In the cup by the bathroom sink. On the nightstand. On the desk. In my boot. I have them saved. Touching them makes me...not anxious exactly, not nervous, but I definitely feel something.

Trip to Vietnam 11th to 25th. Wife and I are avid travellers in Asia and counting. Normally we two-man any country — city hopping, province jumping, jam-packed itineraries, operating on vibes and street food.

Just this in… we’ve added a new member to the travel squad. She requires a slightly slower pace, a live-action feed on tap, has no dietary requirements (yet), and can sleep through thunderstorms, traffic chaos, and probably a meteor strike… just not my voice.

She’ll be 5 months old when we travel.

We’re flying in and out of Da Nang because the wife wants to enjoy doing absolutely nothing on a beach for a few days before going back to work in April — which I fully support as long as there’s coffee nearby.

Normally I’d build a heavy itinerary, but this time we’re thinking:

• ±3 days in Da Nang to let the small one settle (12 + 2 hour flight is going to be quite the life experience for her)

• ±4 days in Hanoi for exploring (could stretch this to 7 if it makes sense)

• Back to Da Nang for another 3-7 days of beach / slow exploring / pretending we are relaxed people

Main Question-

Is Vietnam actually baby friendly?

I’ve come across some super positive posts… but the deeper I go down the research rabbit hole, the more it sounds like navigating Vietnam with a baby could either be magical… or a boss-level challenge.

Things I’m curious about:

• Healthcare access if needed in Da Nang? Am I using the wrong city as a home base if anything had to go wrong with small person 05?

• General ease / safety, I came across the air condition situation already. We are trying to teach her how to keep a mask on just in case

• Survival tips from parents who have been through it

Has anyone hired private transport before in Vietnam?

Travelling pre-baby we would normally just wing it with Grab, trains, scooters, questionable decision making etc… but I’m guessing travelling with a tiny human might require slightly more planning and fewer character-building moments.

Would love any recommended services/companies. Local Vietnamese companies only please

We’ve found some great things to do in both Da Nang and Hanoi, but experienced travellers always know the hidden gems.

Are there any easy travel friendly towns / villages worth adding that are Close to Da Nang or Close to Hanoi or even somewhere between the two

This takes place in Norson, not earth. Specifically early 1900's Norson. Similar to earth. An atrocious lawless war broke out but that's for later.

They were a happy couple, Davis taught Ella how to shoot rifles and general things about hunting. They bonded over simple things such as radio or coffee. Sometimes they'd challenge eachother by seeing who could shoot more cans off a fence in a minute.

Then came the First Norsonic War. Unfortunately they both became Resistance Fighters, they loved their home, The Docherian Imperium and seemed to defend it. 

Unfortunately they were both discovered while they were scouting an enemy supply line. They were immediately shot at and they shot what measly ammunition they had in their rifles and fled. Davis saw Ella being aimed on upon by a rifleman and pushed her aside, getting hit in the liver by a rifle round. Took them until getting home to find Davis's coat all bloodied. 

Ella attempted to bandage, treat and care for his wound. Not believing her husband would die like this. Davis knew he was dying and gave his locket to Ella before succumbing to blood loss. Ella was in agonizing despair after that.

He is autistic which is fine, in the past I have gotten him sensory fidget toys and he appreciates them, but it's been 6 years and I've run out of ideas. He is just a really unique guy and is very particular about his clothes,shoes, socks, electronics, coffee, etc - if he likes it already has the super expensive version he likes. 

Looking for home products/gadgets that would be helpful or interesting but that he hasn't thought of. For example I got him a bedside table that doesn't have legs (slides under the mattress). I got him a very nice hair brush. Body pillow. A lot of stuffed animals/ little figurines. 

He's interested in anything that makes life easier - automatic trash can, toothbrush holder, etc. 

He also likes Elden Ring. 🤷‍♀️ He doesn't cook but might if it was easier. He's on a diet. He likes being comfortable at home.

And oh how so much has changed. I moved across the country, I found a great job, and I'm living a great life. Alone. Single. Without you.

You, you're still there. Even though you promised me you'd find your way to me. That by now, we'd be sitting by our pool, drinking our morning coffee, living our best lives, together. 

You tell me so much is happening, that things are moving toward us, finally, yet nothing really is. You tell me you found an attorney you trust to start divorce proceedings... then told them you want them to represent your wife... who doesn't want to divorce... so now, it's in her hands, and she's doing nothing. And neither are you. 

You tell me you moved into the basement apartment of your house and that she knows about us... yet you still can't talk to me until after she goes to bed, and even then, all we can do is text. Why is that if you're not even living in the same space?

You tell me you've talked to realtors about selling your homes because neither of you want to keep them... yet they still aren't listed for sale, you haven't sold any belongings you say you need to get rid of, and haven't packed a single box. But you tell me you'll be here in less than 6 months. 

You tell me you put in your notice at work for retirement, yet have no date for your last day... which always seems to change... first it's by spring, then by September, then maybe January of next year. It certainly doesn't align with your 6 month timeline. 

You came down to spend a week with me and my family at Christmas. You said she knew you were spending it with me, that she knows your marriage is over. But then you were texting her ""I love you"" behind my back. In my home. You also told me you couldn't spend NYE with me, because you had to work. But yet, less than 24 hours after getting back, you were at the lake, with your wife, snuggled up in front of the fireplace.

And then, yesterday, my brother-in-law took his own life. He was 2 years older than me. My son, who's 25, had to do CPR on his dead uncle. He died by a self-inflicted gun shot. I was devastated. We lost a good person unnecessarily, tragically, and suddenly. And I was also concerned about my son. I still am. That's a vision and memory he will never forget. I told you what had happened, how I felt, how worried about my child I was...  You couldn't even be bothered with a phone call to check on me. Even though you ""live in the basement"" you couldn't make the effort to talk to me. No. I got a 5 word text message with an emoji. And then not another for 2 hours. 

I make myself fit into your world. I make my needs so small and I ask for so little to meet the functionality of this, this whatever the hell this is. But this time was different. You should've called. And I told you that. I told you that I'm worth more than a stupid text message and emoji. That ANYONE else in your life would've gotten more than that. That anyone experiencing something like this, deserves more than a fucking text message. I told you that I was no longer going to reach out to you for any support because you're never there anyway. That I would take care of myself and you can take care of your wife. You agreed, you told me that you were wrong, by text of course. You asked if you could call right then, but I had a patient to see and couldn't talk then, which I explained to you. You said you were sorry, that you'd do better, for me, for us. I told you that you could call today after I was done working because my schedule was packed with appointments. 

Guess what... you didn't call. And why? Because you're at home. With your wife. Again, you couldn't take any time to check on me, with an actual phone call. I'm a so called priority, you want a life with me, but you can't fucking call me, when I needed you the most.

Grime coated everything while bugs fluttered against the windows. Inside this late were two men in a booth up the back, and the an old man at the end of the counter. Sitting down at the other end of the counter a wait-bot slid down it's track at the other side to serve him.

""And what can I get you tonight hon?""

A Rolling Stone sticker was stuck on its face plate, above it someone else had drawn crude anime eyes.

""Just steak and eggs please.""

The bot rolled away into the kitchen and came back with a steaming plate.

""Face like that I'd be worried about what she serves you.""

Jake looked to the man at the other end of the counter.

""Best not to think about it. Food goes down easier.""

The old man smiled as he slid off his stool and shuffled towards him.

*'Please God no'* he thought *'Leave me alone. Seven hours on the road just let me grab a feed.'*

The old man parked himself on the stool next to him. Jake began eating hoping he would take a hint.

""You a tourist  or something?""

He stopped chewing and looked at him

""Truckie."" Replied Jake through a mouthful of egg.

""Really? You don't look like one.""

Jake shrugged. He knew he looked different with his casual summer attire. Not like the man sitting next to him, with his faded cap and coolant circulating jacket.

""Where you off to?"" He asked scratching days old stubble.

""Travelling to Sydney.""

The old man leaned back on the stool, peering outside.

""Interesting. What are you hauling?""

""Lab grown algae. They're planning to dump it in the harbour, eat all the plastic that spilled in from the waterways.""

Jake hoped that as the old man nodded in approval that this would be the end of their conversation. The old man ordered a cup of coffee from the wait-bot then turned back to him.

""Myself I'm carrying a tanker of that flower fuel. You're too young to remember it, but I miss the old diesel smell. This stuff just smells like chips.""

When the coffee was placed on the countertop it was mixed with whiskey from the old truckie's jacket pocket. His jovialness to a stranger trying to mind his business made more sense. The young truckie saw this too often in his short time on the job. Jake looked up from his meal to the two men at the corner booth up the back. The one facing Jake's direction looked up to meet his gaze then looked back at his friend. Jake ate the last piece of his steak and left his place at the counter. Jake walked down to the men at the booth, all three men stared at each other but said nothing. One of them produced a set of car keys and handed them to Jake who exchanged them with the keys to his truck. Eager to get some sleep he left the men at the booth, passed the old truckie at the counter and stepped out into the warm night. Jake walked across the lot full slumbering rigs and trailers wanting an early start in the morning. He passed another column of dormant trucks and walked into the blue, fluorescent glow of a giant holographic advertisement.

""Hey!"" The old man stumbled, trying to walk straight. he stopped, swaying at angles so sharp it was a miracle he didn't fall down.

""What now old man?"" Asked Jake.

""That stuff you told me. Plastic eating algae. Taking it to Sydney. Where you bullshitting me?""

Jake stared at the old man. He was drunk, likely coming down from something that made his blood shot eyes almost glow in the dark.

""Nah man, not bullshitting. I'm hauling tanker full of algae, have been all day.""

He pointed a finger at Jake's hand.

""How about that. Who were those guys you swapped keys with?""

He looked down at the hatchback keys. Why did he trade his rig keys?

""Look I dunno man, I'm just trying to get some sleep. Maybe you should too.""

""Wait a minute!""

The old truckie fumbled with a button on his sleeve to get his jacket working against the heat. He pointed towards a highway sign which read **Sydney 500km**.

""I saw you pull in here, you came up that road which means you're coming back from Sydney.""

Jake tried to recall his route, but he couldn't even remember where he had started.

""No, I was-""

""And look at this,"" He ran a finger across the rig's chrome grill, his fingertip came up chalk white ""there are bush fires between here and Sydney, you've used the powder defences to get through.""

The reek of smoke was obvious on his clothes.

""Are you even a real truckie?""

There was a sound like a tire bursting and the old man crumbled to the asphalt. Jake turned to see the two men from inside.

""Should have thrown him out, guys like that always poke holes in the agent's story.""

""They can't help themselves. I'll get rid of him, you sort out our friend.""

Jake wanted to run. It occurred to him that he didn't remember anything about his life or job. the old man was dragged away, the gun was taken from Jake's hand.

""Your employers are thankful for you transporting their cargo. You're free to get going, they're expecting you back at the offices.""

""What was my cargo?"" Asked Jake.

""Aurora Collateral."" Replied the man.

The sunrise woke Jake as it pierced his windscreen. From his spot in the lot he saw a highway sign which read **Sydney 500km**. If he went now Jake could make it back from his business trip before dark. He blinked the sleep away, started up the car, and pulled onto the highway towards home.",1,1770184997.0,shortscifistories,1,1.0,False

Just this in… we’ve added a new member to the travel squad. She requires a slightly slower pace, a live-action feed on tap, has no dietary requirements (yet), and can sleep through thunderstorms, traffic chaos, and probably a meteor strike… just not my voice.

She’ll be 5 months old when we travel.

We’re flying in and out of Da Nang because the wife wants to enjoy doing absolutely nothing on a beach for a few days before going back to work in April — which I fully support as long as there’s coffee nearby.

Normally I’d build a heavy itinerary, but this time we’re thinking:

• ±3 days in Da Nang to let the small one settle (12 + 2 hour flight is going to be quite the life experience for her)

• ±4 days in Hanoi for exploring (could stretch this to 7 if it makes sense)

• Back to Da Nang for another 3-7 days of beach / slow exploring / pretending we are relaxed people

Main Question-

Is Vietnam actually baby friendly?

I’ve come across some super positive posts… but the deeper I go down the research rabbit hole, the more it sounds like navigating Vietnam with a baby could either be magical… or a boss-level challenge.

Things I’m curious about:

• Healthcare access if needed in Da Nang? Am I using the wrong city as a home base if anything had to go wrong with small person 05?

• General ease / safety, I came across the air condition situation already. We are trying to teach her how to keep a mask on just in case 

• Survival tips from parents who have been through it

Has anyone hired private transport before in Vietnam?

Travelling pre-baby we would normally just wing it with Grab, trains, scooters, questionable decision making etc… but I’m guessing travelling with a tiny human might require slightly more planning and fewer character-building moments.

Would love any recommended services/companies. Local Vietnamese companies only please 

We’ve found some great things to do in both Da Nang and Hanoi, but experienced travellers always know the hidden gems.

Are there any easy travel friendly towns / villages worth adding that are Close to Da Nang or Close to Hanoi or even somewhere between the two

We’re happy to keep things flexible and use Klook / day trips as well

If push comes to shove we’re comfortable winging it — but adding one more base location could be nice if it’s baby-friendly and not logistically chaotic. Can’t exactly mount her on a bike as I’ve yet to see a car seat attached in any car after 100+ videos on YouTube. Definitely won’t get one of a bike 

Would really appreciate insight from anyone who has travelled Vietnam with young kids — especially if you’re also normally fast-paced travellers who suddenly had to learn patience overnight.",0,1770184988.0,VietNam,1,0.5,False

I'm absolutely terrible at this game, but this run legitimately felt easy. Thought I would paste the screenshot here with the seed for anyone who wants to try. Granted, this doesn't show my path choices, but I went for the following when picking my paths.

Act 1: Decent balance of enemies and shops with an elite near the end. Started realizing I was building a defensive deck.  
Act 2: Same as above, but with more enemies now to pay for card removal to get rid of strikes.  
Act 3: Went almost entirely for monsters to get money for more card removal and a few relics.

For anyone who doesn't recognize the relics, here's the breakdown

[Coffee Dripper](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Coffee_Dripper): Got this as a lucky pull from Neow's blessing. Was nervous but four energy that early was too tempting  
[Clockwork Souvenir](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Clockwork_Souvenir): Being able to block the first negative effect in combat was massive  
[Horn Cleat](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Horn_Cleat): starting turn 2 with 14 block was amazing. In act 3 I was landing pretty big damage and making huge dents with this  
[Runic Pyramid](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Runic_Pyramid): Not discarding your hand at the end of each turn is always good. This is always an auto pick for me  
[Meal Ticket](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Meal_Ticket): Totally negated the downside of coffee dripper by gaining health in each shop  
[Matryoshka](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Matryoshka): Another auto grab for me. Extra choices for relics at chest? Amazing  
[Red Skull](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Skull): I never needed this. Strength at low health seemed smart but by the time I got this I just wasn't losing health anymore.  
[War Paint](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/War_Paint): This was honestly a huge part of how I completed the run. It brought my last entrench to 1 energy cost and my last body slam to 0 energy cost. Absolutely busted.  
[Toy Ornithopter](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Toy_Ornithopter): Random reward from the map. It was neat but never needed.  
[Question Card](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Question_Card): Cool to have more options for cards but at this point my deck was working extremely well so I was mostly skipping  
[Empty Cage](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Empty_Cage): Not necessarily an auto pick for me but I grab it more than I choose something else. I don't remember what I dropped, probably a strike and another attack.  
[Pocket Watch](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Pocketwatch): Surprisingly useful. There would be times where I would actually pass my turn because the enemy was either going to cast a buff or a debuff, which I wasn't worried about due to Clockwork Souvenir. This helped me get some pretty heavy turn two and three hits.  
[Molten Egg](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Molten_Egg): Grabbed this to auto upgrade any more body slam's I might find, but I didn't end up finding any more. Oh well.  
[Centennial Puzzle](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Centennial_Puzzle): Helpful in the final battle and a few elites but otherwise not that impactful. I generally wasn't losing health.  
[Thread The Needle](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Thread_and_Needle): 4 plate armor at the beginning of combat with this deck? Yes please.

For the deck I had the following

[Impervious ](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Impervious)\- 40 block + Entrench + Body Slam. Enough said.  
[Entrench](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Entrench) \- Double Your Block and then toss a body slam. Easy damage.  
[Flame Barrier](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Flame_Barrier) \- 16 block is great for entrench and toss out some damage while you take none  
[Sentinel ](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Sentinel)\- I never got the exhaust effect from it but the 5 block was better than nothing  
[Armaments ](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Armaments)\- 5 block is great but upgrading ALL cards in hand made entrench do WORK  
[Body Slam ](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Slam)\- The main damage dealer. I'd get my block to 60, 80, even 90 and just wreck.  
[Iron Wave](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Wave) \- 7 damage and 7 block honestly felt pretty impactful by act 3  
[Shrug It Off ](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Shrug_It_Off)\- Only two, but with Runic Pyramid I almost always had it. I drew into wins frequently.  
[Defend (Ironclad) ](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Defend_%28Ironclad%29)\- Obvious fuel for Entrench + Body slam.

And....that's it. Get your armor as high as you can and then toss yourself at the enemy. Done.

So yeah, if you see some of these options early on, a body slam deck can work if you get the right pulls.

1qvgjwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1qvgjwa/33_alkemia_reviews/,33 Alkemia Reviews!,"This year I made two New Year's Resolutions. One, that I would finally test the Alkemia samples that were sitting on a shelf for like a year, and Two, that I would aim to clear my wishlist and obtain all the monthly alchemies that my wallet allows. 


I originally set out to obtain the perfect signature scent, but instead have found myself building a little capsule scent wardrobe. I'm trying to not limit myself by preconceived notions about how something will smell based on the description and just have some fun.


Any samples and alchemies that I don't keep will be donated to my local trans affirmation station. 


This is the first 33 reviews of my adventure this far. I'll be releasing these in batches of 33 wherever possible as 33 is a great number. The reviews aren't super detailed but I hope you enjoy them regardless. 


Behold!


**1. Smoke and Mirrors** - *An elusive, smokey blend of burning wood, Madagascar Vanilla, and Tonka. We find this one to be elementally simple, but unusually mercurial and highly responsive to different skin chemistries… the vanilla and the smoke dance with each other almost continuously… sometimes the foreground is smoky, then sweet, then returns with sweetly smoky, then smoky.*


Smells like a campfire, and fades down to a lovely soft smokey wood smell, like the scent of clothes you wore around the fire last night. You don't need much, this is a strong one. I absolutely love it. 10/10. 


**2. Bonfire Toffees and Woodsmoked Oud** - *A mischievous blend of bonfire toffees, treacle tarts, and dark oudwood steeped in the smoke from a raging bonfire.*


Smells like burnt candy with a hint of woodsmoke. Fades down to a strong toffee smokey scent. I feel very gender when I wear this. I hope they bring this one back so I can buy ten thousand large vials of it. 10/10.


**3. Encircling Flame** - *An illuminating radiance of glowing golden milk elixir infused with vanilla pods, candied ginger, Kanyakumari cloves, brown sugar, and santal.*


It goes on as an undefined sweetnss and fades down quickly, but the clove scent stays quite strong on my skin. I don't mind it, but it's not something I find myself excited about. 6/10.


**4. Carnival of Illustrious Hearts** - *A glitteringly gourmet gala of French sugarcreams, candied orange blossoms, raspberry cotton candy, rosewater torte filling, and Bourbon vanilla amber.*


Very strong on the raspberry, I smell like a soda. The rosewater pushes through very quickly then softens down to a slightly powdery sweet scent, reminiscent of baby powder. Lovely but not for me. 7/10.


**5. Cidre d' Automne** - *Freshly pressed varietal fall apples delicately blended with subtle autumnal spices. Sweet, crisp and exquisitely mouth-watering.*


This is like a buck to the face, with apples. It goes on so strong, and stays appley with a warm spiced and vanilla scent. It's such a refreshing scent. Initially the strength was overwhelming for me but I find myself reaching for it over and over. Love. 9/10.


**6. St Louis Cemetery no 1** - *An atmospheric brooding of Spanish moss, crumbling stone, old cement, red clay brick, and graveyard dirt.*


It has astringent overtones initially, reminds me of a medical setting. Very chemical. It faded down SUPER fast, leaving with nothing but a vague chemical scent, like I have spilled cough syrup on my arm. 1/10.


**7. Vert Sur le Vert** - *Green, green, green, and more sweet, smooshed greens.*


This has a floral scent, more grassy than flowery. Slightly soapy, and the soapiness increased as it dried down. Smells exactly like the old Pears lavender soap. I had such high hopes for this one when I read reviews that it smelled like tomato plants. 0/10 I hate lavender.


**8. Industrial Sabotage** - *A cataclysmic wreckage of burnt wires; twisted melted steel; shattered machinery, and gunpowder.*


The hot metal scent comes out the gates swinging here. Reminds me of the scent of welding. Hint of dust as it starts to dry down. Smells like worn overalls after a day in a welding workshop. 8/10.


**9. Dustsceawung** - *The scent of forbidden explorations and an olfactory meditation on dust... attic air, the inside of old trunks, abandoned haylofts, library stacks, and abandoned buildings.*


The dust is strong, like you've just opened something from deep storage. Dries down with a vague floral note I can't place, reminiscent of a nursing home. Works best as a layering note for sure, but by itself it's a bit boring. 5/10.


**10. Incantation Cacao** - *A sensual ceremony of raw cacao, sacred Atlas cedar, vetiver root, quebracho tanned suede, green cardamon, orris root, red Rooibos chai, bitter orange, Palo Santo, and acacia flowers.*


I smell spiced chocolate initially, then the cardamom makes itself known. As it dries down the cedar becomes more prominent. It's pleasant, but the cedar is too much. 6/10.


**11. Lola** - *A dramatic splash of Coca-cola trailed by an adoration of blood orange, pink peppercorns, caviar lime, orange blossom, tonka, spicy nutmeg dancing sinuously across a base of warm Brazilian cherrywood.*


The initial scent is very cola candy like. It has some florals, more jasmine than orange blossom to my nose. Softens down to a woody incense scent with a cola after flavour. 6/10.


**12. Breath and Shadow** - *An unearthly perfume of twilit chyprean musks and subtle exhalations of woodsmoke.*


Definitely strong on the musk going on, the chypre top notes are more in line with patchouli for me. It does fade down into a smokey patchouli finish very quickly. Reminds me of incense sticks. 3/10.


**13. Amber Witch** - *A bewitching blend of exquisitely aged dark Arabian amber and honey musk with creamy bourbon caramels and spiced rum.*


The warm burnt caramel with smokey musk is addicting straight from the bottle. It's sweet, smokey with a hint of the spiced rum in the lower notes. As it fades down, sweet spiced vanilla notes start to become more prominent. 10/10.


**14. Au Lait** - *An ultra-cuddly blend of rich, creamy milk swirled with tonka, wild honey, and a cozy touch of caramelized brown sugar.*


First application is really sweet, sickeningly so, my teeth actually ached a bit in anticipation. The buttery notes start to come forward, but unfortunately not enough to cut the cloying sweetness. I used to bake for a living and it makes me smell like eight hour old butter after a shift making croissants. Shame, I really wanted to like this one. 2/10.


**15. Magpies Rhyme** - *A nostalgia of animal crackers, warm milk, a soft blanket, and luminescent white amber daydreams.*


The first time I tried this it just disappeared on my skin in minutes. I waited another couple days and tried again, and it stuck around this time long enough for me to smell it. I've never had an animal crackers but google tells me it's similar to vanilla shortbread. I'm getting vanilla cookie, but not any buttery elements. Definitely getting milk though. The warm white musk is doing a fair bit of heavy lifting in creating the cosy feeling. Its okay, but not really my vibe. 4/10.


**16. Fallen Snow Angels** - *A paradox of crème de vanille and devilishly dark patchouli frolicking playfully amid a flurry of snowflakes and winter ice-mint.*


The mint asserts itself very quickly, tempered very slightly by the vanilla. This fades down to a more earthy toned mint. I am surprised at how much I like this, I usually don't like anything that patchouli has even walked past. If pastel green had a scent, this would be it. 9/10.


**17. Cherries of the Night** - *A very naughty flirtation of black cherries exquisitely bathed in Maraschino liqueur, cherry amber, musky black amber, dark spiced rum, warm nutmeg, and Peru balsam.*


This is pretty boozy going on, it really does smell exactly like a cherry cocktail. As it dries down the spiced rum moves to the top, albeit with a strong cherry flavour, before eventually a slightly powdery cherry at the end of the day. It's very cherry, but the overly boozy scent isn't something I want. 6/10. 


**18. In a Northern Wood** - *A primaeval forest sanctuary of Elemi balsam, balsam fir needles, charred cedar heartwood, dark oakmoss, opoponax, aged oudwood, deerstongue fern, woodsmoke, aromatic fungi, patchouli, and loam.*


The basalm is very intense then fades down quickly. The patchouli pushes forward. I'm not getting any woodsmoke, dirt or loam at all, or really anything but patchouli. It has a very sharp smell. 1/10.


**19. Hygge Sanctuary** - *A plush winter blanket woven from the gourmand spicy confections of Hygge and the cashmeric skin musks and Feuille de Vanille of Winter Sanctuary.*


First application is very sweet almond, it reminds me of marzipan, with vanilla. In the bottle it wasn't grabbing me due to the overly almondy essence scent but on my skin it's a lot less intense and far more delicate. It slowly fades down into a spiced vanilla. I find myself wearing this one to bed regularly. 8/10.


**20. Winter Sanctuary** - *The velvety warmth of a fireside cuddle - creamy skin musks wrapped in a sensual blanket of softly spiced Feuille de Vanille and delicate kisses of ginger mint, French lavender, and dried Somali rose petals.*


I was really hesitant with this one as it contains two of my most hated scents, lavender and rose. The musk and vanilla are very strong on first application and really nice, kinda like eggnog. It does have a faint rose low note but it's really unobtrusive, and none of the lavender. Delightful. 9/10.


**21. La Cheminee** - *A cottage-cozy evening of sparkling spiced cider spiked with brandy and clove-studded lemon slices nesting with smokey vetiver, star anise, perique tobacco, honeycomb, tonka, soft woods, and a worn leather loveseat by the fireside.*


The tabac is pretty strong, which I usually like, but the clove and lemon are disagreeing with who gets to be the top note and resulting in quite an astringent scent. Surprisingly the tabac and lemon lose the fight and the cloves are the victor. On fade down at the end of the day it's just the tabac again, with no nuance. Its an unusual scent but I think it lacks that special something that would make it a keeper. 6/10.


**22. Afterglow** - *A glowing veil of golden musk, Madagascar vanilla beans, woodsmoked black amber, chai tea, spiced rumcake, and incense woods.*


I actually said out loud ""Musk Sticks!"" when I put this on, it smells just like the candy. The incense woods pushed forward very quickly, and threaten to turn soapy with the musk. Alas the threat is valid and I now smell, once again, like pears lavender soap, now with a veneer of musk. I had such hopes on smelling the musk and it's been ruined. 1/10.


**23. Trick or Treat** - *A grownup confection of black licorice, mandarin orange peel, caramelized brown sugar, bourbon vanilla, candied ginger, tonka bean, blonde patchouli, cedar tips, oakmoss, and sandalwood.*


Woof this is sweet, with the peel adding a bit of bitterness to cut it. Not really getting much black liquorice, or anything of the lower notes. I am getting a warm spice of something as it fades down but it's pretty undefined. Maybe the ginger. It's nice but not for me. 6/10. 


**24. Caveu des Innocents** - *The promise of erotic debauchery and elegant iniquity beckons... tabac, dark coffee, piquant cloves, rum soaked pears, candied citron, dark caramel, and star anise bathed in intoxicating swirls of opoponax, labdanum, hashish, benzoin resinoid, vanilla incense, and guaiac wood.*


I am such a sucker for smokey caramels. This has a touch of bitterness from the tabac, and the coffee is rounding it out so it's not sickly. It has a sweet dry down with undertones of woodiness. This has similar energy to Bonfire Toffee. 10/10. 


**25. Affaire de Coeur** - *A sweet enchantment of creamy white musk, Madagascar vanilla, white sandalwood, tonka, white amber, and sugarcane.*


Very musky going on, with the sandalwood blending well. It's very sweet, but in a soft way. It fades down to a vanilla baby powder-esq scent. I really like this but it lacks any personality on me and the baby powder dry down isn't in my 2026 energy. 7/10. 


**26. Book of Twilight** - *An intricate autumnal tapestry of cashmere and tweed wrapped in star anise, wild honey, Japanese incense, cedar, oak leaves, violet leaves, smoked amber, vetivert root, applewood, nutmeg spiced bourbon, coriander, mandarin peel, and red saffron.*


This is an odd one. It's definitely woody, with a refreshing brightness to it. Im not getting any anise or bourbon notes, and the longevity is not great. I would love this as a scented candle rather than a skin perfume. 7/10.


**27. Quintessence of Debauchery** - *A distillation of raw, bawdy sexiness without regard for gender - Bourbon vanilla, tonka, dark oriental florals, peach brandy, coriander, mock orange, fresh ginger root, rock rose, long leaf tobacco, black opium infused amber, patchouli, oakmoss, and cruelty-free castoreum.*


The bright citrus notes are really strong but are tempered by the oakmoss and florals. The patchouli is there but not obtrusive. I dont get tonka or vanilla at all. There is a slight muskiness from the castoreum, but overall this feels like a scent that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. 5/10.


**28. Book of Shadows** - *A biblichor of eldritch books - heavy parchment paper, ancient iron oak gall ink, crumbling leather bindings, and wafts of rare incenses.*


The ink is very strong going on, like crazy intense and a bit sour, and I'm detecting dust notes. On dry down, the main scent I'm getting is ink with vague dusty incense every now and then. Definitely no leather. It's really unusual and very dark academia, but I don't find the strength of that sour ink scent to be attractive on my skin. 6/10.


**29. Wing of Flame** - *Wild honeycomb, agarwood, golden coffee, birch syrup, Deertongue grass.*


The sweetness is immediately cut by the agarwood, adding an earthy smokiness that is different from woodsmoke. It's almost chocolatey but not quite. The woody birch comes through as it dries down. It does get a little powdery but not overly so. 9/10.


**30. Love Amongst the Ruins** - *An ancient ruin of fallen stonework covered with lichen and tangles of flowering vines slowly disintegrating/returning to nature.*


The floral notes are overpowering on first application. There is something distinctly unpleasant mixed in that smells astringent. I don't get stone, moss or even dust. Just stinky florals. I am washing this off, it's goddamn nasty. 0/10


**31. Pearle Noire** - *A darkly opalescent skin scent  - cream musk, black vanilla, myrrhis odorata, black cardamon, white sandalwood. Alluringly mysterious.*


My first thought is that this very much smells like that cheap ""linen"" scent in a lot of big box stores. There is something in here I find deeply unpleasant, but I'm not sure what, as all the notes are ones that individually I enjoy. I don't know if it's the mix or my skin, but this is a hard no from me. 0/10.


**32. Writers Blood** - *The primal angst of artistic passion - iron-tinged blood, a manuscript soaked in spilled black coffee, and an overturned tin of rolling tobacco.*


I can definitely smell the tabacco, with undertones of metal reminiscent of Industrial Sabotage. The coffee is there but not obtrusive. There is some ink in there, which is once again smelling sour - Im starting to think my skin just brings out the sourness of ink in general. It's a very unusual scent. On dry down it's a lovely mix of Tabac, coffee, and a little metal, which I really like, but I have to suffer through two hours of sour ink to get to that point. 4/10.


**33. Pi in the Sky** - *Atypically autumnal... warm apple pies rising heavenward on effervescent billows of spiced aldehydes.*


I can smell sweet cinnamon and nutmeg going on, it really does smell like baked apple pie filling. This is not a subtle perfume, I only popped a bit on and still had to wipe half of it off. I was worried the aldehydes would get soapy on dry down but it stays true to its baked spiced apple self. Fair warning though, this has been aging in my collection for about a year as when I initially tried it, it was just overpoweringly sweet with nothing else. Definitely worth it. 9/10.",12,1770184701.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

It appeared that cop cars were blocking off the entrance to Summit in between Thomas and Harrison. After five minutes, two of the cop cars pulled in front of our apartment. 

When they turned off their lights, we realized they were unmarked, non-descriptive vehicles, with no indication they were police. There were at least 15 people walking in and out of these cars all dressed in SWAT gear. Some had guns, one had a full sized chainsaw?!??

With 15+ loud bangs/gunshots, and many cop, cars, and people in essentially swat gear, we expected that this would be reported on citizen, or a police dispatcher log, or any other forum such as R/Seattle, but found absolutely nothing.

1qvgfzh,https://i.redd.it/hrhdxztw2fhg1.jpeg,Help understanding lab results + advice on how to make meaningful changes in 3 months,"Hi - I recently had a lipid panel. Attaching a summary of the results. Feeling a bit discouraged and worried about the results as she made it sound really concerning (where as my sister in law who's a doctor said it's nothing to worry about). Since my worst number sare largely genetic, my doc wants met to try and get all my other numbers to be much lower with lifestyle changes and recheck in 3 months. I want to avoid statins for now as I hope to have another baby.

I met with a dietician on Nourish who didn't offer any advice. I'm not sure where to focus on changes and not sure how to think about the risk.

Curious on thoughts of where I should focus my lifestyle changes, if statins are the best choice with the genetic predisposition, and any clarity on if breastfeeding can cause higher cholesterol & if my “good cholesterol” helps lower risk (I see mixed things on these two) 

Some context outside of the blood panel

\-36 years old, 5'5 and 139 lbs

\-9 months postpartum, still breastfeeding and back to roughly my pre pregnancy weight.

\- had preeclampsia postpartum, was on blood pressure meds for roughly 2 months

\- have Celiac's so already have a restricted diet and can't eat out a ton or eat a lot of packaged foods / simple carbs

Exercise - I'm fairly active but don't do as much moderate-high intensity workouts these days - wondering if this is where I can make improvements

\- live in SF so take hilly walks, sometimes with a baby carrier or stroller, at least every other day.

\- Workouts are more irregular these days but try indoor rock climb, yoga or yoga sculpt class, pilates class or 20-30 minute run at least 1-2 times a week. Typically 2-3.

Diet - gluten free, cook exclusively with olive oil or avocado oil 

\- Breakfast: Eat 2 eggs & spinach and almond flour tortilla OR yogurt with walnuts or almonds chia seeds, flax seeds & hemp hearts and roughly 2 coffees or lattes a day with oat milk

\-Lunch: Usually leftovers of dinners, salad or tuna

\- Dinner: Some version of salmon, chicken or turkey with veggies and rice, have red meat maybe 3x a month as ground beef or steak,

\- Snacks: lots of berries, apple, peanut butter, almond flour crackers, mixed nuts

\-Dessert: sometimes make gluten free cookies, usually have a piece of dark chocolate every night

\- : I drink 1-2 times a month and it's 1-2 glasses of wine

\- Supplements: Nutrafol post natal, fish oil, choline, probiotic, sometimes take collagen powder

Eating out: We probably eat out 1-2 times a week, it's usually asian food or salads or chicken rice bowls

Weekends: do a lot of weekends away with friends + 3-4 dinners at a freinds house per month, this is probably where my diet veers off the most and where I have more cheese, chips, etc.",1,1770184349.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

On certain mornings when I go down the street to the bakery to get a chocolate cannoli (4.50) and then up the street to the cafe to get a small latte (4.00, saving me 1.50 over having bought both a coffee and cannoli at either store), She also goes down the street to where a gravel laneway once joined the road, but no longer does - instead the lane sits elevated on a sandstone wall over the bend of the main road, amputated at either end. Here she observes men and women wandering up the footpath on the road, and notes their individual dispositions, tallying their number up and filing it away into her mysterious interior record. It is a cold morning, but the still mist in the air signals a sweaty humidity that will reach its peak in the noon sun, punishing those below her dressed for their chilly morning commutes. 

Satisfied with her survey, she scampers back up the street - darting under a car when a passerby attempts to approach her. He is crouched and clicking his fingers to beckon her over. She does not approach, but the attention interests her, as a new phenomenon to observe and catalogue. We face each other down, her green eyes studying me silently as I contort myself to see through the narrow gap between the curb and the underside of the car. I give up and return to the chair on my front porch to eat my breakfast, and she returns to the tile step by her front gate and sits erect, tail wrapped around her feet. We will sit and pretend to listen to the children playing in the public school next door, as we continue to study each other from across the road. I will finish my latte and cannoli and rise to go inside, and she will duck slightly with alarmed curiosity. I will close the front door behind me and she will jump back up to the windowsill, slightly ajar, and pass through a gap in the curtain back into her home.

Truth got revealed the company hosted private party...,"I’m a 25F, and I’m writing this to help organize my thoughts after the huge rollercoaster of emotions I went through just last month. I really felt the lows and the highs. The actual story starts three months ago, when I was hired as an assistant for the Data team manager. My first week was fairly normal, but slowly, the manager Mrs. Zee started showing her true colours. She treated our team like we were her personal minions and completely changed her tune whenever someone from Senior Management came by. She'd talk with them all nice and polite, and in front of the seniors, she'd pretend to respect us, too. 

As soon as they left, all hell would break loose again. 

Our office day would start at 8 A.M., and she'd stroll in around 10 or 11 A.M. The only good thing about this was that it gave our team some breathing room in the morning. 

It was on one of these days, about half an hour till 10 A.M. We weren't slacking off or anything; everyone was doing their work while chit-chatting about what we were working on, the news, the recent game, or plans we'd made. Zee hated when we talked while working, saying it reduced productivity and wasn't professional. She also hated when people snacked at their desks, even drinking coffee from a takeout cup, saying we didn't respect the company's lunch hours. 

That day, for some reason, she arrived half an hour early and ""caught"" me and my work friend (I'll call her Star here) being ""unproductive."" She walked up to our desks and started screaming about how unprofessional we were and how this would make her look bad in front of the Seniors, even though I had never seen her work on anything useful herself. Then she proceeded to ""confiscate"" the two cappuccinos Star and I had bought. 

She even submitted a ""Misconduct"" email to HR about us. It was infuriating. I think the only reason Zee even got hired was because of her family connections with board members.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qvg9rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MailOrderBrideFacts/comments/1qvg9rw/afa_story/,AFA Story,"Spent some money corresponding with someone on AFA. Thought I would share some highlights.

I was suspicious that I was talking to the woman in the profile from her first response so I decided to poke the bear.

I first noticed I was being charged for attached images that weren’t being sent. They would be approved and allowed to be attached but later marked as rejected. 

Either way, messages went back-and-forth every 2 to 3 days for a couple months so I told the woman whenever she was ready I would be amenable to having her sign IMBRA. I heard back from the agency that she declined and the woman later told me that she had done so in the past and the man turned into a stalker. OK.

Frankly I grew bored with the method of correspondence so I told the woman that I would be in Moscow in a couple of months and wondered if she would like to meet for coffee and if perhaps she would care to do a video call before then. She wrote back and agreed enthusiastically. So I responded asking whether there were any days in November that she wouldn’t be in town and whether it was all right if I initiated the video call through AFA.

She disappeared. After a while, I DM’d LoveScoutCEO to let him know I would be writing this review. Eight hours after that conversation, I received an email from this woman. It had been 19 days since I attempted to schedule coffee or a video call. 19 days after nearly daily correspondence.

She made no mention of my invitations and had no explanation for her disappearance. She spoke about the importance of transparency in an online relationship. I had some money left in my account with AFA so I opened the attached image files and found pictures that were at least a year old (thank you pimeyes).

I wrote back, and it’s been a few months now and I have not heard from her, 4 months later. Also strange. 

I have since spoken to AFA on the phone twice. I have emailed the company about this through their general email on their website and heard nothing back from there so I called again and received an email address for a woman named Liz who I was told handle such matters.

After a week Liz wrote back and told me that anything handwritten was immediately flagged, despite the fact that is not mentioned in their TOS and with no explanation as to why I was charged for those images regardless. It’s only a few dollars per upload but I think it’s the principle of that counts.

She insisted that the hesitance to sign IMBRA was prevalent in that community. However, I’ve asked dozens of Slavic women for their contact information and have never had an issue because quite frankly, it’s quite easy to block a person on telegram and nearly impossible to make burner accounts there with which to stalk someone.

She also insisted that it seemed as though this woman was interested but there might’ve been scheduling issues. Completely glossed over the fact that she disappeared for 19 days only to resurface when I started talking about it, and completely ignoring the fact that she had every opportunity to set a date and has yet to do so.

Anyway folks, my contention is that real human being simply do not act like this. Slavic women don’t have an issue giving out their contact information. They’re not inherently different from Americans. People that respond to emails on a daily basis do not go out of their way to avoid progressing any further. And daily communicators do not disappear for three weeks only to resurface with no explanation. And quite frankly, American men that speak Russian are quite the curiosity to these women. 

Before anyone says “that’s why you should go on a tour”, this is the same company that hosts the tours. There is no way my situation was on the up and up, and I can’t believe the tours are. Quite frankly, given the target rich environment they are described as, if we don’t hear a 100% success rate from every man who attends them; every single man walking away with a wife, there is something dishonest about them.

Anyway since this experiment, I met a woman in Moscow on a language exchange app. We were on Telegram then Zoom wishing 10 days. I went and visited her there 10 weeks after we met. She picked me up at the airport. We have since then met in Istanbul, have a trip scheduled for April, and filled out and submitted the I-129F which has been accepted by USCIS. It’s not hard at all to meet these women and to move things forward and make things happen, if you know who you’re talking to, because they’re just regular people. 

I’m not some butt hurt man who doesn’t know how to talk to women. I knew there was something afoot when I started this communication and discovered more and more evidence of that and felt compelled to share my story here.

If you want to meet women in a foreign country, start learning their language, get on Findmate or HelloTalk, and know who you are talking to. An American man who is learning their language is a novelty, plus you have the added benefit of operating without the gatekeeping AFA, their bureaucracy, and questionable business tactics.",1,1770183786.0,MailOrderBrideFacts,0,0.67,False
1qvg8zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarMax/comments/1qvg8zl/i_am_buying_the_dip_in_the_xray_flux_possible_big/,I Am Buying the Dip in the X-Ray Flux - Possible Big Flare in Coming Hours,"https://preview.redd.it/f5x3xj3fuehg1.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4adfac821a9ed815d8098b2f96a3925b9cc90b9

Above is the current x-ray flux over the last 2.5 days or so. I circled the rebound point. We can see that the big flares have been preceded by a significant dip in x-ray flux. This pattern is especially prominent in the shortwave. 

This leads to believe we may get a big flare within the next several hours. No guarantee it will be eruptive, but another x-class flare is squarely on the menu if the pattern holds, and at this point, not much reason to suspect that it wont. Although, trying to predict what the sun will do is enormously harder than analyzing what it has already done and I generally don't do it. 

This is an observation, not a prediction. I am not saying anything for sure. I am only pointing out a pattern. 

Also, I want to be crystal clear about this. We expect big flares from this region because of what it has already shown us. It has shown us nothing that would give the impression a dangerous solar storm is about to unfold. This is typical behavior in the descending phase of solar maximum. If you were here 2 years ago, you can recall me writing about it. The descending phase is where the fun stuff often happens, and for some reason, especially on odd numbered cycles. 

Let go of the anxiety. Have fun with it. Witness it. When we get through this, and we will get through it, you will be glad to have been on the front lines watching it unfold. This is one of the best episodes of solar cycle 25, even if it has not been particular eruptive concerning coronal mass ejections. We have had several x-class flares and countless m-flares and there is one mediocre CME to show for it. That can change, and I tend to think it will at some point, but still, that does not equate to a Carrington Event. 

You have to stop and ask yourself: If the risk level was really that high, would SWPC and ESA posture be so demure? Would the well versed and the credentialed in the space weather community be so care free? Is this episode somehow more risky than May 2024? That episode saw the same type of flare cadence and magnitude range, but very eruptive. AR3664 was legitimately compared to the Carrington Event region and is mentioned along with 0466 from 2003. 

Solar Max Carrington Index (0-5) remains at 2.7 and I promise you that if any concerning signals were to manifest, I will see them, and I will not mince words or speak cryptically. I don't engage in the hype because if I express concern, I want it to mean something. Your trust is much more important to me than spiking engagement or getting coffees. That doesn't mean I am too careful or that I don't respect the range of possibilities. It just means that in my best analysis of current and ongoing solar activity, I see no cause for wide concern of a historically extreme solar storm like a Carrington Event. I just see solar max 25 in all of its glory doing what is expected during this part of the cycle.

I am willing to venture that there will be a period within this descending phase where the index rises to a value where out of an abundance of caution, I will have to report we are in a high risk window and I have a criteria for that. Even so, I want to point out that we have been in countless similar higher risk windows over the last several decades but got through them just fine. Many things have to break just right for that to happen and there have even been times where a near Carrington Class CME was launched at earth, arrived in 14 hours, and did nothing because it coupled poorly to earth. There have been times where near Carrington Class CMEs were ejected but missed. It's rare for a reason and it's not just about how active the sun is. Everything has to line up just right. 

I gotta get some sleep, but I will keep my notifications loud.

Good Night Everyone!

1qvg7k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1qvg7k3/possible_mcas_one_for_the_ladies/,Possible MCAS? One for the ladies...,"Hello, looking for advice... So I (43 F) have multiple health issues (allergies, rosacea, type 2 diabetes with reactive hypoglycemia, tennitus, body aches, cold intolerance, brain fog, possible PCOS, etc) and I've been thinking for some time that a lot of my problems may be linked. I have trouble with weight loss, but am generally pretty active, and seemingly have no food allergies. However, I do have a lot of other allergies. I'm wondering if MCAS may be a culprit, especially on the allergies front.

  
I say this because some days I can be exposed to allergens and be just fine or alleviated with my allegra or inhaler, but other days the same allergens crate a multitude of issues ranging from hives, asthma, headaches and dehabilitating brain fog and body aches. This was especially prominent over the summer while wildfire smoke was rampant, leading me to an er visit with a slowed heart rate and some abnormal blood work (I went after 3 days of headache and extreme brain fog (words were hard, 3rd grade math may have been beyond my skill set).

I have read that rosacea flares and bouts of ""surprise you're allergic to everything today"" could be indicators, and that possible high histamine foods could be a trigger even if you're not allergic?

Today I had a mild episode of fatigue/brain fog/some hives and felt the urge to explore this as a possibility again. The day started with ""hey its that time of month"" (after 3 months) and slayer and pantera decided to write a song about your uterus... I otherwise felt fine, a little wrung out/achey... but in my time of woe decided to have a chocolate fairlife paired with a slice of chocolate pie rinsed down with coffee, and around 20 minutes later felt very foggy  (mass chocolate/caffiene?). After that I decided to pet my dog, who im very mildly allergic to on paper, but don't generally have issues with, and broke out into hives and hot rosacea cheeks. 

So apologies for the TMI, but could MCAS be a possibility for such things? If so any advice on how to tone down the symptoms when they do flare up?

\*side note, my mother has hashimoto's (thyroid), and i've been tested, my tsh was slightly elevated but in range, and my other bloodwork was normal\*

So recently I had a 3 date weekend with a girl I met long distance on Instagram. We talked for a year previously but after a few FaceTime dates really hit it off. 

I took a chance and flew across the country to see her and I feel it worked out. 

She is a social media influencer that’s pretty well known but relies on herself. 

I even as an older guy in my mid 30s have very little experience with women as I’ve been the friend zone guy…. This one happened to give me a chance. 

I own a pretty lucrative online type of business that gives me the ability to work anywhere. 

Our first date was at a high class restaurant, 2nd I took her to the mall and 3rd was coffee introducing her to my friend before I left.(which was unplanned) we left the 3rd date agreeing it’s ok for me to reset my mind towards moving her way and living together one day. 

My concern was I didn’t get a kiss the first weekend, when I asked she wasn’t turned off but said she was “shy” and wasn’t ready. I don’t feel “friend zoned” once again, but considering this is long distance and I don’t want to end up in the friend zone again what do I do? 

I really like this girl in so many ways and am willing to wait, but with my inexperience how long is too long? She did let me hold her hand, pda on every date and took a lot of pics together but I just don’t want to be friend zoned once again. She even brought up marriage jokes herself, which she never did online.

* [Taqueria los Arbolitos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/obS9wJLE6VnWG6NQA) for suadero and adobado (SP) - while Toño has the better suadero and toppings, the combo of adobado and suadero made the best taqueria meal for me. I also prefer one slightly sturdier single tortilla to 2 weaker stacked tortillas - just a personal preference 
* [Tacos Toño](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pCySVwdPqLGNm6HGA) for suadero tacos (Sayulita) - the meat was perfect, and a bomb salsa bar. The mixto was also great
* [Mary’s](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aTMqxYJdTE3y4js99) fried fish tacos and anything with poblano (Sayulita) - was kind of expecting this to be a tourist trap but god damn, the batter on the fish was really remarkable. So light but maintained its crunch
* [Cava](https://maps.app.goo.gl/66jRgLEjne2mCa8v5) for raicilla, mezcal and Palomas (Sayulita)- Awesome selection of local liquors, great bartenders, and a happy hour
* [**7 spa**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HMfTdXVwVH38LQoS8) (Sayulita) - Not food or drink but need to shout them out for maybe the best massage I've ever had. More expensive than on the beach, but a bargain for the quality. It was tremendous.

* [Su Pancha Madre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hRUpXDrbQWusw2ZQ7) for sopes and vibes (SP) - even though the unique sopes themselves could have used a bit more moisture/doughiness, the fillings were wonderful. Plus the service, setting and live music were lovely. 
* [Verte Cocina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nh3HKjH8aYE3MFMp6) for dinner (SP) - rotating menu, dude cooking out of a truck or cart or something, but everything was on point. They were also spinning quality records so solid ambience   
* [Serpiente](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WXhA3P8iHYp9VLBh6) for cocktails (SP) - original, high quality, and good vibe
* [Estrella de mar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PhMXT3GbZAXxspov5) (Sayulita) for camarones tacos gobernador & ceviche tostadas at (Sayulita)

**B tier**

* [Ikan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D1KAJGwb4KmvhEeE7) for seafood (SP) - mixed bag. the Aguachile rojo was maybe the best dish I had all trip, but others dishes had some major quality issues. The oysters came out too warm, as did the tuna on the tostada, and for dessert they put ice cream on top of plantain chips, which made them rock hard and inedible. Couple little tweaks and it could have been the meal of the week. 
* [Dolce Amore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GAcQWpChoTryUNfX7) gelato (SP) - bad google reviews on service but fine for me, and a very good cone to end the night 
* [Itacate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sCrhdbgbnVpN5DBG6) for arrachera tacos (Sayulita) - after eating there, I heard from a local that the Arrachera is overhyped, and I should have gotten the sirloin. Salsas were good, and I liked the charred onions in foil. 
* [Chilaqueria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g8UGgfMH1ajxrgCC9) for chilaquiles and cafe de olla (Sayulita) - chilaquiles were pretty good but would come back just for the coffee and vibe

**C tier**

I am having a mixed experience.

Questions:

\- (seemingly unrelated, but maybe not): when you grind single doses, do you blow the below at the end in the grind you are going to use? (I have a belief doing so adds more undesirable fines into the puck, am I wrong?)

\- I am onboard with the benefit on extraction and flavour of the step down baskets, and quite like the original one I bought (graph) despite the curved bottom and holes sizes and disposition looking less than optimal (results trump those). However

\- I can’t find a 46mm blind shaker, and I have challenges with the one I 3D printed: 1) does the hive mind think that a shaker made of plastic makes the grind behave differently and not work (due to like static or something?)? 2) the mound resulting from dumping the blind shaker in, as is, is not conducive at all to even extraction, even with a couple of taps to even out the puck mound. Have people found tiny levellers? Tiny WDT to use after (despite Hedrick showing results doing this is worse)? 

\- with a shaker, are you meant to end up with a central mound, or a donut (more on the sides than central)? The latter seems better to me as the water flows faster along the sides than in the middle, so more coffee there would slow it down, evening out the grind exposure to water, Vance more even extraction? + the 3D model I used is actually called « donut espresso shaker ». …

I’ve had a lot of chemical encounters in decades past, a lot of drugs, the volatility of opioid addiction, cocaine, mad needle abuse, prescriptions, fucking diabetes and associated drugs. 

Speedball will wreak havoc with your mind-set and your body. It’s heaven and hell, and the higher you get , the closer you are to both. It is the penultimate vista of earthy desires and spiritual turmoil, a fountain of near-death passion, cascading fits of sensation and experience. 

But it’s not an escape in an emotional sense. Emotion is ever-present, antithetical to the stereotype of a junkie. 

However, my affair with anti-depressants have been a soft annulment from experience. Heroin makes things brilliantly and utterly soft and comfortable, but close, like a sexual experience. Lexapro makes things so even we don’t recognize  its evenness. There is no pleasure in it, no sex about it, no nothing really. I both want and abhor the emotionless state of this drug. When I stop doing it for a while, I get sense of what it was to be a caring, emotional, hurting human. It was so long ago now it’s hard to recall. It’s been a decade or more using it and its more regular than coffee. But when it shows where my legs once were, my mind goes to those long lost places where I felt more than I thought.

After having received my Profitec Go just a few weeks ago, I am now looking to upgrade from my old 1ZPresso JX Pro manual grinder to one of the Profitec grinders.

Where I live, and due to import taxes, the A54 and the SD54 cost basically the same. I would like to stay with Profitec as it visually matches the machine and I have a trusted distributor here in my country which is important to me in case of warranty and after-sales service.

I live on my own and usually go through a 200g bag after 6-7 days. I usually drink between 1-3 espresso a day, sometimes one of them gets swapped for a cappuccino. Either way, I never swap beans as I usually start and finish a bag before eventually trying a different roast. If the girlfriend is around and up for a coffee on a weekend, then we use the same beans here again.

So far I've single-dosed with my JX Pro and kept the remaining beans in an Airscape. I am unsure what grinder would best suit my use-case, I am leaning towards the A54 as I am going through a bag within a week and I don't swap roasts. Would you agree with my opinion here?

My personal challenge? Crafting something that felt genuinely *curated chaotic* – a little mismatched, a little artsy, but still wearable for a coffee run without looking like I'd slept in it. And crucially, doing it on a budget with products I already had or could grab easily.

My goal wasn't perfection, but expression – how to convey that thoughtful disarray without actually being a mess. Here’s what my latest dive into the alt beauty deep end taught me:

**My ""Thoughtfully Disheveled"" Chaotic Curator Experiment**

*   **Aesthetic Blend:** Primarily **Chaotic Curator** vibes – art student who threw things together but somehow it just *works* – with a dash of **Functionalist** pragmatism, meaning I wanted multi-use products and minimal fuss.
*   **Inspiration:** That feeling of pulling a random scarf out of a thrift bin and making it the centerpiece of your outfit, or the intentional clutter of an artist's studio. I wanted my face to tell a similar story.
*   **Key Products & Price Points:**
    *   **Eyes:**
        *   **e.l.f. Cosmetics Bite-Size Eyeshadow Palette in ""Berry Bad""** ($3) – Specifically used the deep berry matte shade and the shimmery lilac.
        *   **NYX Epic Ink Liner in ""Brown""** ($9) – I wanted a softer, less precise line than black, but still defined.
        *   **Essence Lash Princess Sculpted Volume Mascara** ($5) – My go-to for fluttery, slightly clumpy (in a good way!) lashes.
    *   **Cheeks/Lips:**
        *   **Milk Makeup Lip + Cheek in ""Werk"" (mini size)** ($18, but I used a sample size I had) – A dusty rose that I dotted on my cheeks and lips for a cohesive wash of color.
    *   **Brows:**
        *   **Wet n Wild Ultimate Brow Micro Brow Pencil in ""Ash Brown""** ($6) – Just to fill in sparse areas, then brushed through.
*   **Application Techniques & Time:**
    *   **Eyes (5 mins):** I started with the matte berry shadow from e.l.f. on my outer corner, bringing it into the crease with a fluffy brush, but *not* blending it perfectly. Then, I took the shimmery lilac and pressed it onto the inner half of my lid with my finger – no primer. The NYX brown liner was applied in a slightly smudged, short wing, intentionally not sharp. A quick coat of Essence mascara, not worrying about separating every single lash.
    *   **Face (3 mins):** Minimal base – just a little concealer where needed. I dabbed the Milk stick directly onto the apples of my cheeks and blended with my fingers, then patted a little on my lips, leaving the edges soft.
    *   **Total Time:** About 10 minutes from start to finish.
*   **Budget:** Roughly $23 for the core products if buying full-size (minus the Milk stick, which I used a sample of). Very accessible!

**The Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**

My first attempt felt… a bit like I’d just forgotten to finish my makeup. The key was in the *intentionality* of the mess. I learned that ""chaotic"" doesn't mean ""unplanned."" For example, I initially tried a vibrant blue liner with the berry and lilac, thinking it would be *more* chaotic, but it just looked jarring. Switching to a soft brown liner still felt unexpected with the berry/lilac combo, but created a harmony in the overall ""I didn't try too hard but I definitely thought about it"" vibe.

Also, going light on the base was crucial. A heavy foundation base would have made the intentionally undone eyes and lips look out of place, almost like I was trying to cover something up. Keeping the skin natural let the pops of color feel more organic and true to the aesthetic. It wasn't about looking ""flawless,"" but about celebrating the texture and story of my face.

Here in Canada it's $3149 + 12% taxes (total of $3526) and that was just a little steep for me.  I even resisted when it went on sale around Christmas for $2900 ($3246 with taxes)

Unfortunately I couldn't stop thinking about it so decided I'd email a retailer and ask if they could match the sale price from Christmas.  They said yes.  So then I thought I'd try a couple other retailers, as all they can say is no.  Second retailer matched it and added coffee beans, and the third offered a deal I couldn't refuse.  They got me in under $3k all in and even offered a free scale (I said I had a scale so they gave me some free beans).

Anyway, if you've been on the edge of buying a new machine but you just couldn't quite justify the price, just ask for a better deal.  Worst they can say is no.

Just seeking advice on how to stabilize my body and mind. (crossposted to /talktherapy /therapyabuse /CPTSD):

**Background:** I have a hx of high-profile childhood trauma. Journalists and podcasts reach out on occasion, but I don’t grant interviews. Because of that, growing up, I was extremely isolated and had only one friend ever, who was my whole world. When they died in our early teens, I was sent away to ‘recover,’ grieving alone with adults in another country. I hadn’t had another friendship since. My current therapist was fully aware that I have no social support system. I have medical issues that occasionally make verbal communication difficult, so while I do attend in-person weekly sessions, I also rely on writing/reading during appointments.

Our years of EMDR, EFT, IFS, CBT, and talk therapy had been immensely helpful, but were very clinically informal (*they said that’s just how they are with everyone*). In addition to 50-minute in-person weekly appointments, some running longer to 90min-2hrs, we also exchanged long letters a few times monthly, and portal DMs multiple times a week (*started in the beginning*). After several years, a death in the therapist's family mirrored the loss of my childhood friend. I reached out to them with some nice words, and we met up shortly after at a local coffee shop. After that, they and I became real-life ‘best’ friends for a year—exercising together multiple times a week, meeting their family members, attending social events, emailing and texting daily. We engaged in a large community project together. I was even introduced to their social circle. They discussed their client case load with me, introducing me to one of their clients in hopes we would hit it off as friends (we did not). I continued paying for my weekly therapy during this period.

Logicality, looking back, I knew this was an issue. But at the time, they became my new ‘everything’ my life had been missing.

However, immediately following family losses of my own, after a year of being ‘friends’ they abruptly pulled back and gave me an ultimatum to choose between being a ""friend"" or ""a patient."" Needing to make the decision quickly in their office that day, I chose ""*patient*"" out of fear of losing them entirely too (my thought was that it’s easier to lose a friend than a good therapist, though I regret that decision today). Once I made the decision, they immediately became an ice-cold clinical stranger. I lost my entire social circle at once and all my new shared hobbies overnight. It felt like my childhood trauma was being replicated again in real-time.

They’ve insisted on a ""no written communication"" rule (for them). I’m acting out with unanswered portal messages because I’m in a panic, trying to figure out how to fix this (and yes, I’m pretty wordy).

They claim our friendship was an ""experiment"" for my benefit, which they said they thought would help. But that it was bad for them as a dual relationship, they now regret, during their grief. They keep insisting in session that there’s more than ""one truth,"" and for some reason I don’t understand, I feel they’re refusing to acknowledge my ‘facts’ I keep looping on, and my reality of that year.

**Current State:** Months later from the choice, I feel I continue to get worse/destabilize each week, and I am somatically ill during and after appointments. I freeze and cry in appointments. I’m looping mentally when I wake up each day and go to bed. They’ve threatened to refer me out because I’m ""too much,"" which sends me into a panic.

They’ve apologized a couple of times with a ‘but’ qualifier (“I’m sorry you were hurt by this.” “I’m sorry you’re in so much pain.” “Remember, you made the choice.” “I need you to respect my peace/boundaries.”)

***Question:*** How do I care for myself here? Any suggestions? I still like my therapist, and I still very much want to work with them. I feel like they stepped into the role of my only support and then ""killed off"" that version of themselves when it got messy. I know I’m looping on my childhood friend dying, but I don’t know how to get out of this loop.

Is there any path to repair, or is staying there with them destroying me? I have attempted multiple times to explain it exactly like this to them, but their coldness has remained. I keep crying through each session, and I don’t know what else to do.

I will not report them. Nor do I want to start over because they are the only person who knows my full history. But I am barely functional and mildly self-harmy (not acting). Any advice?

  
Edit: I did seek out another provider 6 months ago in my very small town temporarily, consulting over a few appointments, but they wouldn't work 'on' me; they kept only wanting me to report :( So I walked out on that provider. But there aren't any other providers outside those two clinics nearby. And I don't like telehealth since I stammer. ",13,1770182097.0,CPTSD,15,1.0,False

I recently went for my HSG and Ultrasound after being referred to a fertility clinic. We're doing all the first rounds of tests. Just wanted to quickly share my experience for anyone who is on the fence with going to a fertility clinic or getting further tests done.

I was nervous about the HSG primarily and read a lot of stories of negative experiences. Definitely not minimizing others painful experiences - that is a real possibility, but when I went it was not painful at all, incredibly quick and had a great attending doctor. The actual process of getting on the table to getting off was maybe 2 minutes, once the catheter and dye was in it was probably 40 seconds and most of that time was getting the right tube to fill. There were 4 other women sat with me who went first, only one of them came out and said it hurt her but not as much as she thought. I took 600mg of Ibuprofen 1 1/2 hour before. I was tense and had high BPM before going in so I wouldn't say my body was ""relaxed"" - it still went fine. The transvaginal ultrasound was even easier and was maybe 4 minutes total. My husband couldn't come into the HSG (radiation) but did come in for the ultrasound and he was just in awe seeing my ovaries and follicle that I'll be ovulating from this cycle! 

Definitely wear a big pad after as immediately after getting off the table you leak. They gave me a cloth that I was able to use to wipe before getting out and into the change area. I was spotting for 24 hours after but nothing heavy. I wore comfy clothes, something easy to take off from the waist down, long socks (thank you whoever said this). Hot water bottle helped any mild cramps after. I went to a coffee shop after with my husband and then home for an hour before going for my ultrasound. More so felt tired from the early morning appointment than the actual procedure. Rest helped this.

Advocate for yourself too! Was very blessed that both doctors were female and incredibly soft spoken and guided me through, made it feel less ""violating"". Overall so glad I got it done, gave me peace of mind and reassurance.

Disclaimers:
1. I have what i'd call mild period cramps, start a few days before my period and can have sharp twinges but I don't take Advil or anything during my cycle and haven't for years (they used to be more painful in my 20s but after focusing on diet they're not any more so my pain tolerance is lower I'd say) 
2. I didn't find my pap smears painful just that weird cervix type feeling 
3. I don't get ovulation pain 
4. My tubes were both unblocked although my right took a while to fill, the Dr had to push more dye through which is when I felt very very mild fullness in my abdomen. When it come to the end the doctor believed both tubes were patent so that could also aid in it feeling painless for me 
5. I am in Canada so have to wait for referrals and hospital wait-list, I don't get to pick doctors or ""shop around"" - but it's also free which i'm beyond grateful for. 
6. I was CD12 when I went

How do you cope when you never wanted this life for yourself? I mean, I dont think any of us do but my cousin who just games all day seems content with herself. For some reason I cant relax. I cant feel hope because everytime I do something goes wrong. I wish I could be chill like her. She doesn't worry about the future. She just watches shows and plays games. I want to be like that SO BADLY.

How does anyone cope with the isolation? Im used to going out with friends and doing fun things now I just sit and envy  anyone who participates in the world in ways that I cant. How do you cope with the insane envy? 
Im literally going crazy just sitting here. No job experience or anything, no matter how many applications I submit nothing happens. Trying to go to college and my transcripts get messed up. I already workout and eat well and get sleep and I still feel like shit.
Not to mention i feel so angry because I had to trade opportunity and community for safety. Sometimes I want to go back just so I can maybe go to college, even if it was unsafe for me. I know that's dumb, but i hate watching YouTube all day. Im going stir crazy.
There aren't any hobby clubs near me, I cant drive. In the summer sometimes I walk to a coffee shop just to sort of vicariously live through the normal people working and socializing. I feel so weirdly pathetic doing that. Like putting on makeup and getting dressed just to pretend to be normal. I hate it. How do I make myself hate it less?

How does a few shots of espresso or 2-3 cans of redbull make you feel? 

I hear a lot of people with ADHD in online spaces say it has “no effect on them” which is just… really hard to believe.

I personally have a weird relationship with caffeine. I never consumed caffeine until I was much older because I just didn’t understand what it was supposed to do. The times I had drank a Monster or a Red Bull I just felt normal. Probably would be able to fall asleep IF I was already tired, but in no way have I ever felt like caffeine has made me “more” tired like so many online claim it does to them (even saw a woman claim she “takes an Adderall to go to bed”). 

So when I got older I would drink 2 or 3 Red Bulls at once, and most of the time I would still feel tired as shit but I could definitely feel the energy in my body. I’ll start to shake and maybe get a little anxiety. 

**TL;DR** Basically, if I’m already tired, I will still feel tired mentally, but I can definitely feel its effects on my body. I feel like the lack or absence of effect caffeine has on people with ADHD is waaay overstated, but I can be wrong.",2,1770181721.0,ADHD,8,1.0,False

1qvflcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caverns_of_Connection/comments/1qvflcc/a_tale_recounting_a_group_of_young_soldiers_foray/,A tale recounting a group of young soldiers’ foray into adventure,"Havelock was sitting in the back of the company truck with the majority of her squad, watching Heidelstam and Stratton play rock, paper, scissors. Stratton was in her early-to-mid-20s, her enlistment a result of a successful propaganda campaign against Sonn-Ni. She was absolutely crushing Heidelstam.

“You’re part Kin, you gotta be. You’re reading my mind!”

“You literally tell me what you’re gonna pick half the time!”

“Yeah, ‘cause it’s funny!”

On the side of the truck Havelock was sitting on, Van Hoorten was eating his hand-packed breakfast; an egg-banana-potato sandwich with bacon wrapped around it, alongside a mason jar of peanuts lathered in mustard. Havelock, not being an expert in Iyran culture, figured this is just a strange eating habit they have. She was incorrect. Van Hoorten was just weird.

“Van, does that taste good there?” She decided to ask, wondering if it was worth trying. The blue frog-man turned and blinked at her.

“Nö.”

A pause.

“…Fair enough, I guess.”

In the cab of the truck, Kit was sitting behind the wheel, while Dyler was sleeping in the passenger seat. Kit told him he was allowed to until they were about halfway, then he would have to wake him up. They were coming up on the halfway mark at about this point, Kit reaching to Dyler’s side and nudging him with his arm. “Turdan, we’re halfway there.”

Dyler grumbled, slowly awaking. “I’m up, I’m up. That only felt like five minutes.”

“It was two hours.”

“Really? Jesus.”

They remained silent for a few minutes, until Dyler spoke again.

“What do you know about the guy in charge of the camp?”

“Not a lot.”

“Y’know his name?”

“Lieutenant Kilgrave. Outranks me by about a metric ass-ton. They told me he’s not \*mean,\* per se, but he can hand out a real load to carry if you screw with him.”

“Meaning what?”

“Don’t quite know. Maybe boot-camp punishments? Like, wearing a trash can around your torso and rolling from one end of camp to the other?” He could barely get through the thought without laughing. Dyler had no such qualms, showing perfectly clearly how funny he thought the idea was.

“That totally happened to you, didn’t it?”

“No comment. Anyway, he reports straight to Macaulay, one of the Lord Regent’s top guys. I don’t know what exactly they’re doing down here, but I know if it goes to the top like that, it’s probably something big.”

(Timeskip indicator)

As the truck drove into the mouth of the cave, the two soldiers in the cab remained on alert as they parked in front of another squad sat just inside, presumably in wait for them. Kit got out first, giving Dyler a quick pat on the shoulder before hopping out the side. Dyler followed, heading toward the back of the truck to inform the rest of the squad that they had arrived.

At the front of the group of unfamiliar soldiers was a balding redheaded man, estimated at about 40 to 43 by Kit, sporting a beard that smelled of coffee and must have measured at least five inches.

“First Sergeant Kitsuragi?” The man spoke in what would be recognized on Earth as a Scottish accent.

“Yes, sir. I presume you are Lieutenant Kilgrave.”

“You presume correctly. I trust you had an alright trip out here?”

“Yes, sir, at least mostly. A few members of my squad were tired the first few hours.”

“Were they? They like coffee, your boys?”

“Some do, sir.”

“Aye. Well, the ones who do can have some of ours. The rest can, I dunno, drink cave water or something.”

“Believe you me, sir, there’s a good chance one of them was going to do that anyway.”

As the rest of the crew began piling out the truck, Kilgrave and his squad walked further into the cave, leading the rest in. One of the ginger’s men, a skinnier blonde young woman, eyed the group curiously as they walked and spoke amongst themselves. Eventually, she asked what was on her mind, directing it to Stratton, who was walking side-by-side with Van Hoorten.

“So, why did the Grand Regent pick \*you?\*”

Stratton turned her head, still walking forward. “What do you mean?”

“I mean, this squad looks almost like… a hodgepodge of random people. Two regular-ass guys, a girl who’s mom-age and thinks she can rock green hair…”

“Hey!”

“A smelly fat guy…”

“\*Hey!\*”

“And an Iyran who smells like he couldn’t decide what to eat for breakfast, so he ate \*all\* of it.”

“Hey, now.” This objection did not come from Van Hoorten, who had no issue with her claim, mainly because it was true; he \*did\* smell like that. Rather, it came from Stratton, who had just removed her hand from Van Hoorten’s waist. “You can make fun of my squadmates. Most of them deserve it. But you’re not gonna have a good time here for as long as we’re here if you go and start talking about my man that way.”

Dyler smiled to himself. He loved when people realized Stratton, who many would consider a beautiful young woman, was dating Van Hoorten, who many would consider “HIM!?” The realization dawning in their eyes was usually the funniest bit. Here, it was no different.

“Wh… that doesn’t make… with \*him?\*”

Van Hoorten now turned to look at the rude blonde girl, fittingly frog-blinking.

“Hęllœ.” 

“Do you even know English!?”

“Ĩ ľıke to płåý åňð ďřäŵ.” 

(Timeskip indicator the second)

The joint group of soldiers had boarded the train that led far, far further into the caves, watching something that none of them, not even the most senior among them, understood the existential ramifications of. Dyler sat by himself, wondering how he was going to build his empire from deep inside a cave. He obviously wasn’t able to bring his supplies with him in the company truck. Was the Grand Regent punishing him? Why would he do that? He gave him the right amount for his cut. This whole situation baffled the young man to no end.

“Hey, whatcha thinkin’ ‘bout, Turdan?” Heidelstam, cigar in hand, interrupted Dyler’s thoughts. He offered the cigar to him, already producing another out of his pocket with his free hand. Kilgrave and Kit had adjourned to another train car, so Heidelstam, naturally, figured he had time for one cigar.

Dyler took the cigar, Heidelstam lighting it for him. “Eh, y’know. Just wondering why we’d get stationed way out here, away from… everything, really.” 

“Hey, way I see it: few guards, isolated location, super hidden area. We’re getting paid a Pioris armed force guard’s salary to sit in a cave for maybe a year with our nuts in our hands. This is probably THE best outcome we could’ve gotten!”

“Yeah, but I kinda wanted… I dunno, to do something? Like, be an actual soldier.”

“What, you don’t think this counts as soldier work?” Heidelstam scratched the back of his head, his close-cropped dark brown hair ever-so-slightly rustling.

“I mean… not really, honestly. You don’t get respect working somewhere like this. You don’t get power, you know?”

“Aaahhhhhh, I get it,” the chubbier young man smiled, crossing his arms. “Youngblood here wants to make some power plays!”

“I don’t think you can call me Youngblood. I joined, like, two months before you did.”

“Yeah, yeah, whatever.”

Dyler finished his cigar, tossing it out the train window. “I don’t have any plans yet. Well, none to share.”

“Well, hey, man, when you get to the big leagues, squishing the little peasants like ants, don’t forget the sad sacks you started with.”

The younger-looking soldier smiled, but didn’t say anything. He felt as though anything he’d say would make the situation awkward.

Thankfully, the train began to slow, and the group began to shuffle to the front of the train. As the train approached a very slow stop, the doors opened to a gigantic cavern, with walls spanning maybe a hundred feet high, glowing mushrooms crawling out the walls and floors. Soldiers and scientists were scattered about, doing what they presumably did every day down in this dark haven of research. From first impressions alone, this certainly looked like a place one could grow accustomed to staying.

Kilgrave spoke up, clearing his throat.

I’ve been frustrated with my mom for a while now, as it feels like anything I say is met with suggestions and her trying to help me do things.

For a while, since I was about 16, my mom has been really protective of me. I went through a really bad depression and was hospitalized a few times, and since then, she’s tried to take care of me the best she can. I love her dearly, and I appreciate everything she’s done for me, but I’m at a point where I need her to allow me to make mistakes on my own.

Some examples of the behavior I’m talking about are:

Whenever she asks me to do any task, no matter how simple, she always feels the need to describe every small detail about it. For example “Can you set the table? Make sure everyone has a spoon, fork, knife, napkin…” 

Every time I express stress in any way, or anything at all is not according to plan, she immediately goes to offer me solutions for how to fix it. For example, the coffee shop I like to study in was closing early, and she called me right as I was leaving. I mentioned in passing that I was gonna find a new place to work for the day, and she immediately starts giving me recommendations nearby, and trying to orally describe directions to the place.

My mom gives me an allowance every month at college, which I’m grateful for, but I want to learn to be responsible for myself and my own wellbeing, and not be handed money for nothing. Whenever I bring up this desire, she tells me that getting an allowance is “part of the deal of going to college”. 

Whenever I’ve talked to her about my relationships or my girlfriends, she tries to inform me of some cautionary tale about how “you marry the family”, or “you shouldn’t even consider life plans until you’re out of college.”. It starts to feel like she can never be supportive of me and allow me to make mistakes on my own.

I tried addressing this to her, and telling her how it was making me feel, but she got upset and told me she wasn’t doing anything like that. I just feel as though I’m an adult now. I’m not stupid, and I know I can handle a lot of things in life on my own. I just really wish I could talk to her without it feeling like she’s trying to solve all my problems

I feel like I’m too close to the situation to get a valid sense. I’m incredibly privileged in my life to have a mom who loves and cherishes me, but I want to have the space to learn lessons and live on my own without her input. Am I overreacting?",0,1770181568.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.5,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bpGJ3BN200): **November 23, 2025**

Apologies in advance if this post seems disorganized, my head is still reeling from all this. 9 years ago (I was 18 then) my older sister eloped with her then boyfriend. Our parents (we're an immigrant family) were vehemently opposed to her relationship, I remember me being ok with it personally, it wasn't my place. She eloped with her boyfriend and cut of all contact with us. My parents were besides themselves. I tried reaching out to her back then on different platforms but was blocked. I even reached out to her best friends and asked them if they could at least get me in touch with her, they said she didn't know where she lived now, but that she'd told them she was happy. She had also left her workplace. Eventually we all (me and my parents) came to like an unspoken agreement to pretend she was never here, and I blocked her everywhere too. I remember being extra particular to call regularly when I was in college because I was worried about their state of mind. We're now at a place where I can't remember the last time she crossed our minds.

Yesterday my sister knocked on my apartment door. She cried and hugged me when she saw me, I hugged her back initially too, I wasn't really thinking at the time. She was just going on about how much I had changed, how much she'd missed me all these years. Eventually I kind of remembered everything, and asked her why she was here, and who had given her my address. She said she had swore to them that she wouldnt tell. I asked her why didn't she call first since whoever gave my address probably gave my number too, she said she just wanted to see me in person. I told her we'd gotten over her, why was she here. She said her issue had only been with our parents, not me, I told her about how I'd been blocked too by her when she left. She told me she was sorry she'd hurt me, but she had wanted a fresh start, told me I was an uncle to a nephew and a niece (they weren't there at the time, they were at their father's, they recently divorced). She acted surprised that I wouldn't know, said she'd told someone to tell our parents about them.

Maybe it was hearing about the divorce that frustrated me more, because if we were going to have gone through all this pain, at least she could've found lasting happiness, I just told her she was a stranger to me now. She said we could have lunch together she wanted to know all about what I'd been up to, I told her it was best if we continued to have no contact, she didn't act like an older sister when I needed her to, and that we were no longer family, we'd mourned her already and we were now strangers. She was tearful, she gave me her address and phone number and left.

Last night, I spoke to my girlfriend about what had happened. She said she was still my sister, that I shouldn't have just turned her away. I told her she didn’t know what we'd gone through in the days after she had eloped. But I still wanted to know here AITA?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** What are your parents thoughts? How do they feel about potential reconciliation?

> **OOP:** I haven't told them about this. I don’t see the point I guess, they made their peace with her absence a while back, we all did.

**Commenter 2:** What is it that you want to achieve? This is crucial to answering the question. 

> **OOP:** I don’t know. I really had internalized that I'd never see her again. I remember the hurt I had felt at the time. I don’t want to lose my headspace and I don't want to act like everything I went through was ok, that it shouldn't have any meaning or consequences. And of course I want her and her kids to be safe and happy too.

**Commenter 3:** Did she even apologise? Or did she do the classic, it's such a long time ago you should be over it by now move? If there's no sincerity, there's no trust that she won't ghost you again. She owes you a full and frank conversation about what happened, her actions, her motivations and why she continued to block you. Without that you really have nothing to work with. Good luck.

> **OOP:** She did apologize, she said she was sorry that she had cut me off, that she never meant for us to lose touch, her beef was with our parents only. I brought up that she blocked me everywhere, and she was just sobbing and apologizing. I also remember me begging her best friends for info and them saying they had no idea, which I’ve always suspected was them lying because she asked them to.

**Commenter 4:** NTA. She broke all contact with you for nearly a decade. She treated you as if you were disposable. There is no relationship to salvage. She doesn’t get to unilaterally decide to pick you up again just because it works for her.

I’m guessing she’s decided now’s a good time because she’s getting divorced and in essence needs something (time, attention, connection) from you. Ask yourself, if she weren’t getting divorced, would she have reached out?

You need to figure out who shared your address with her.

> **OOP:** I hadn’t thought of this and I've been feeling sick thinking this might be true since I read this. That she wouldn't have ever reached out if she hadn’t gotten divorced. Would've been fine without ever seeing me again. Although she didn't ask for anything material during our interaction I guess, she wanted lunch, she thought after 9 years of almost forgetting I had a sister, id be ok with lunch.

**Commenter 5:** OP, I wonder if her bf turned husband made her block you all? Could it be that getting away from him might be why she was able to reach out?

> **OOP:** I don’t know. Back then she would vouch for him a lot in front of our parents who really thought he was bad news, so idk, she seemed like it was all of her own volition.

**Commenter 6:** Absolutely NTA. When will people start accepting the consequences to their actions? And why do other people think they can tell you how you should have responded to her?? Your girlfriend should have kept her mouth shut and just held you and let you talk and been there for you. I wouldn’t tell your parents you saw her either. That’s a band aid you don’t want to rip off.

> **OOP:** I won’t be telling my parents. If she reached out to me, she can reach out to them the same way, though she told me she won’t be doing it, she'd only reached out to me.

**Commenter 7:** NTA but that's a tough situation to be in 

Just out of curiosity, why didn’t the family accept her then bf? Cultural? Religious? Age?

> **OOP:** They just didn't think he would make a good partner I think, she'd be vouching for him, and they (particularly my mom) would be telling her that essentially he's only interested in sex to put it crudely. There may have been other subconscious reasons possibly idk, but at least when they talked about it they would only bring up that he was bad news and that they were looking out for her.

**Downvoted Commenter:** Keep in mind that she might have cut you off because she was scared you would tell your parents anything that she told you.

> **OOP:** No. We had covered for each other so often when I was young. She had covered for me too. There was stuff that I could only tell her. That could not have been a real fear. I'd even told her friends that I wouldn't tell our parents but at least ask her to meet up with me. I'm sorry if I sound pointed but I haven't had to remember all the bs I went through in the aftermath of her elopement in a while and its just crazy how she just ditched us all. I don't think I can see her, I'd been thinking about it, but meeting her just means everything she put us through was fine, I remember how I felt at that time, and I can't let it go.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/zH7yp3nXaF): **November 27, 2025 (four days later)**

Hi. Thanks a lot to everyone for the support in my post. And to those who reached out for support. I'd been emotionally drained almost after meeting my sister. Like I said I had made my peace, after a lot of hurt and futile hope, that I would never see her again.

She had my number, and I hadn't blocked the new number of hers. I'd thought about it, and received advice to, but I just didn't, it slipped from my mind. She asked me on Tuesday how I was doing, and asked if we could meet on Wednesday, she really wanted me to meet her kids. I was really conflicted, I didn't want to oblige her, but I decided to say yes to at least meet them.

I went to her apartment yesterday and met my niece and nephew. My niece had recently turned 9 and my nephew is 6. They're great kids and I really enjoyed seeing them. I remember feeling a certain way when my sister was introducing me and she told him, that the way he's my niece's younger brother, similarly I'm her younger brother. We talked a bit, and started talking about stories from us growing up. I hadn’t and still haven't said everything's ok between us, but our stories and conversation went smoothly. I learned that after she eloped and got married she had moved in with her husband into his place in a town a few hours away from us. That around 2019 they had had moved to the city we were currently in (according to her she didn't know all this time that I later moved here for work after college too). I told her about what I'd been up to all these years, my college, my job, my girlfriend etc.

After that, the kids were in their room and my sister brought up us all doing something again over the weekend. I told her we weren’t ok, she can't expect me to forget everything. She said she was sorry that her moving out had nothing to do with me, that she missed me. I was angry at the fact that she had no idea the pain I'd gone through both personally and then having to be the crutch for my parents pain. I told her I didn't believe her that she would've been perfectly fine with never seeing me again if she hadn’t gotten divorced, that I could've been dead and she probably wouldn’t have broken a sweat upon learning it since she was so blissed out from her domestic life. I know it was ugly, I've never said anything like this but in that moment I just wanted her to feel some kind of hurt of the kind she'd given me. She broke down and said I can hate her if I want but to just not hate her forever, there has to be a limit. I regretted saying what I said when I saw her crying so I just sat next to her and asked about why they'd divorced.

She told me that their life had been going alright the first few years. She said she'd even sent word through a mutual when the kids were born (which either the mutual messed up or my sister did because we never heard about it). She said when covid happened her marriage became hell for her, that it had uncovered a side of her ex she never knew. He became abusive, had disdain for their son, revealed he used to record every single conversation of theirs, had convinced her she was crazy and a bad wife and mother. That she stuck with him because of the kids until she had enough, that a very good neighbor of theirs whom she had become friends with gave her a lot of support and even helped line her up with a job. During all this she even blamed our parents for her sticking with the marriage for so long and for not reaching out. I told her they had literally pleaded with her not to do this, I was there, I was 18 not 8. She said they told her she was dead to them if she ran off with him and so she blamed them for her not being able to leave him. I told her that was insane logic and she just didn’t want to talk about them and asked me not to tell them about her. I said yeah her relationship with them is her own.

I also asked her who had given her my address, she begged me not to ask her that, that they hadn’t given it easily she'd had to swear secrecy, and cry and convince them that I'd want to see my older sister, so I dropped it.

We had tea and snacks after that she asked me again if I wanted to do anything this weekend since she has the kids or we could do something the weekend after just the two of us, I said I don't know. She was ok with that answer. She was tearful again when I was leaving, we hugged and I hugged the kids goodbye too.

My mind has been a mess since then. I lashed out and everything, but also regret what I said, but then I also try to remember how I had felt back then and then get angry again. It feels so weird knowing that shes now 20 minutes away from me and we can visit whenever. I told my girlfriend about all this, she said she supports me no matter what but in her opinion to consider the weekend plan with a cool mind.

This got long, I apologize but Ive been trying to collect my own thoughts on this and writing this just seemed to help. Thanks for the help.

**Relevant Comments**

> **OOP:** I'm glad you and your sister talked? I'm late to the party, but I was in a similar boat recently.... and my sister is now married to a woman. So, good luck OP!

That's a great moment to... just be at least hear out one another? on what's happened, one another's view that doesn't mean you're forced to do anything, but at least you have the ability to decide if this is something you could pursue.

My sister came from a DV relationship, and so did I... the fact that we're both still alive and able to talk about our shitty parents is a huge support beam in my system. She is still recovering, and so am I. But we have one another, and she had her awesome wife!

Just, take some time off the internet and enjoy a day where you relax, go out for a nice coffee and lunch, maybe to the park, all on your own and just think. Allow yourself to cry in your car, talk to yourself, a you day with selfcare, or maybe a day in cuddled up warm pillows, creating/drawing, but I really recommend getting out of the house off the internet. Dopamine media detox for a day basically, and let yourself feel, and think.

> **OOP:** I’m going to try and clear my mind thanks. I've been thinking this again and again that I should do what makes me happy, and maybe that is being able to reconnect with her and her kids and then I think that's letting her off too easy, I was in pain back then trying to reach out, what about that. Its been emotionally taxing. Your advice about taking some tine off is good.

**Editor’s note: OOP made the next update into the same update post**

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/zH7yp3nXaF): **December 8, 2025 (11 days later)**

**Update:** Hi, I’d been getting a lot of moral support and advice from a lot of people here which I appreciate. A few people had asked how things have gone. So I told my sister I couldn’t sped thanksgiving weekend with her. Partly because maybe I still wasn’t in the right headspace for something like that and also because I had t go to my parents for that weekend, and normally when I go there I usually end up staying over for the entire weekend. She said ok, asked me not to tell them that she was back in my life, i said fine, it wasn’t my place and besides my parents had come to terms with her absence a while back.

It was a bit surreal for sure to be with my parents and have this secret with me. We were spending the weekend like a complete family while my sister was at her apartment and knowing this was weird. When I was back she asked if I wanted to hang out next weekend (the one that just passed), her kids would be with their dad so the two of us could hang out.

I know what a lot of commenters had said. I appreciate all their advice. But I had tried to clear my head and my girlfriend had just told me to do whatever makes me happy. I did think about it, and I honestly decided that hanging out with her on Saturday would make me happier than not doing it. It wasn’t about her, it was for myself, so I went to her apartment on Saturday.

She asked me how our parents were doing I said they were doing well now. Since she was the one who mentioned them I asked her if she wanted to reconnect with them, it might be better for both her and maybe them, but she said no, and just repeated that line about them saying she was dead to them. It was clearly something said in the heat of the moment but I didn’t push her on it again. We just went to the mall, bought some clothes, then had dinner at her place and watched a movie. It was a light hangout in general, the conversation flowed smoothly. It obviously wasn't like it used to be, partly because I still keep thinking about how I felt when she had left us, about how I had to support our parents emotionally in the aftermath and partly because she has changed a bit, shes a lot more anxious and nervous now than I remember her. But in general it was a chill hangout.

I did bring up that I’d like to know who gave her my address that at this point I didn’t regret that they had given it to her but still they shouldn’t do that. She got defensive and begged me not to ask her that, that they hadn’t just given it easily, she’d had to plead and cry and promise that she’d take a rejection if that’s what I did, and that she’d sworn secrecy. So again I dropped it, its whatever I guess. I left and we said we’ll meet up again soon.

I had received a lot of comments saying I was stupid, that I had no self-esteem that I was being used. I just would like you to understand that this isn’t an abstract concept for me like it might be for you. This is my sister. The same sister who i grew up with, who helped me with school projects and helped me out in a ton of ways when I was growing up. And yes the same sister who ghosted us for 9 years. I’m still angry about that, but like I said I’m only doing what I want for myself, not out of some guilt now. And look so far I’m down a subway fare’s worth of dollars to visit her and a few hours at the mall, I’m fine with that loss. If after all this she ups and ghosts me again in the future for whatever reason, I’ve made my peace with that, and may we all get what we deserve in that case. Thank you for all the help.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!emotional manipulation!<

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditor_Updates/s/Uz7GFKvXYq): **January 28, 2026 (a bit over 2.5 months later)**

**Update: AITA for telling my sister we were strangers after she broke all contact with us** 

A few people had asked how things were going. I'd taken a bit of a break because its just complicated and I felt asking others input was hurting more than helping.

My sister and her kids and I had been meeting up whenever we could find time and it was enriching like I liked that we were spending time regardless of a lot of feedback saying I was being had.

I went to my parents for the Christmas and New Year's holidays. During that period there had been a couple of gatherings with the entire family, uncles and aunts and cousins. It was in those gatherings I guess that I contextualized the extent to which my sister's actions had affected our family. All the other families were full, all siblings and kids, some of them with their spouses and young kids of their own. Ours was torn. And the entire extended family would still walk on eggshells sometimes. None of my cousins had had to listen to their mom cry about their estranged sister while in college studying for exams and midterms and what not.

I also realized I had been lying by omission to my parents about something huge, the whereabouts of their daughter whom they still love and worry about. My relationship with them is the one that has sustained and withstood. So a couple of weeks ago, I told my sister as much. That asking me to keep a secret like this wasn't fair. I was kind about it, I didn't lash out, didn't try to make her feel bad about everything we'd been put through. She was the one who got heated, saying our parents had told her she was dead to them, that she was facing hell while they had left her to die, I then brought up that they were the ones who did their best to prevent her from ending up in that situation and she was the one who had left because she thought she knew better, because she cared more about her boyfriend than her entire family whom she cut all contact with. She didn't budge on not talking to our parents, and I too said that we can't be talking then, I'm not risking a staple relationship for one that had proved to be flaky. That may have crossed a line because that led to tears.

We didn't tell my niece and nephew that I won't be seeing them for a while. I don't know what she's going to explain to them. its painful for me too. Since then my sister hasn't said anything on text just sent pictures or videos (like she was already doing) of the kids or what was made for dinner, a few times. I've heart reacted but said nothing either. I do hope we can come to a resolution on her end and the kids get to be close to their uncle and their grandparents.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I'm glad your sister is safe but it's really not fair for her to put your relationship with your parents in danger. Are you going to tell your parents that you heard from her?

> **OOP:** No I won't. I won't take that decision from her. Thats her call. If thats why she didn't contact me once all this time, its unbelievable that she thought I would have.

**Commenter 2:** Yikes.

I feel like there’s something missing. Like were you parents somehow abusing her which drove her into the arms of her ex-husband? Did she cut them and you off because of the “you’re dead to me” comments? Maybe her ex weaponized those comments to keep her isolated and she’s too close to the situation to think logically.

A lot of time has gone by and I’m surprised she still feels this strongly. What will she do when they’re dead and reunification is impossible - cry some more?

I think you have exceptional moral character by really thinking about your relationship with your parents and not wanting to be complicit in hurting them.

> **OOP:** No, my parents have never been abusive. They'd always given us nothing but safety and love. They felt strongly about whom she was dating but in hindsight they were right. They said something in the heat of the moment but were inconsolable in the months after she left until we all without actually saying it had decided to never mention her for our own peace.

**Commenter 3:** Your sister is selfish and put you in an impossible situation.

She wants a relationship after what she did but it’s still on her terms.

She doesn’t get to dictate anything after what she did to you and your family, now it’s all blown up in her face she’s happy to let you back in her life. Ask her if she was still with her husband would she have even bother trying to connect with you.

I seriously doubt it OP.

**Commenter 4:** Your sister is putting you in the middle. She wanted you to keep it secret from your parents that you and her were in contact, yet she won’t reveal who told her your address. Why is she protecting this other person but doesn’t appreciate the position you’re in, especially if your parents did find out that you had been meeting with her and their grandchildren.

She doesn’t seem to understand the emotional distress she’s putting you under and appeared flippant when you mentioned that she had also blocked you all those years ago. Sounds like a one-sided relationship to me.

There’s still too much unresolved hurt and emotions going on here. Maybe a little break might help you to clear your head a little and help you to decide what part you want to play in this whole mess.

Good luck

something I couldn’t hear. I asked her to repeat it several times before we both just gave up and

ran to the bar to grab a drink. The usual of course, we looked around looking for anyone we

might know and that’s when we locked eyes. Your eyes were green and you looked like a cat in

the dark with your eyes the only thing visible. You started to smirk, but I blinked and looked

away quickly before I could tell if you did. My friend grabbed me as she dragged me to the

dance floor. Our favorite song was on and we were singing at the top of our lungs and dancing to

the music. You were then walking the other way and I decided to sneak a glance, at the same

time you did. You seemed too perfect and too beautiful to be human, so I let it go and decided to

enjoy my night. By the time I got home I was exhausted, but you were stuck in my head and I

was annoyed I didn’t have the courage to just ask for your name. What if you were the one? Anyways, I hope you’re doing well and enjoying life wherever that may be.

Now I sit at some dark and awkward place for a first date, unsure why I didn’t pick the

place. I pretend to listen as he’s talking about his job and not bothering to ask me a single

question about mine. No worries, I didn’t want to talk about it anyway, I think, and mentally roll

my eyes. It’s better than the last date I didn’t go on where he canceled the day of for some dumb

reason, as they all do. I get home from the date and send the very templated text about how great

of a time I had blah blah blah. I throw my purse on the couch and plop down as my cat jumps up

and joins me. “Sorry buddy looks like it’s going to be just me and you for the foreseeable

future.” He just meows and rests his head on my thigh. “Yeah I get it,"" I say and laugh.

“He’s really great though!!” My friend is basically shouting at me as we sit at one of our

favorite coffee shops. “I appreciate the date set ups, but the last couple have been interesting…, I

trail off. “I know I know she says, but this is going to be different I can just feel it in my bones!”

“Come on, Jude they all either only love themselves or don’t show up,” I say. Please, please, do

it for me! And if it’s a bust I promise I’ll never bug you again! I can’t help but smile because she

really does mean well and wants me to find “the one.” I’m laughing when I look over her

shoulder and see a man looking over. Your eyes are green like a cat's and you have a mellow

attitude about you that makes you seem like you don’t care, but I know you really do. You’re

looking right at me and I’m so stunned I don’t know what to do. You’re the guy I saw from the

bar the other night, but you’re gone the minute I blink. I’m starting to feel you’re not even real

and only made up in my head. “And that’s why I think you two would be great together!” I

realize Jude has been talking about the guy she’s going to set me up with for the last minute and I

didn’t hear a thing. “Yeah sure I say, that sounds like it’ll be fun!”

The date was fun in a way, but we both know there isn’t going to be a second one. As I’m

walking home alone because I really couldn’t come up with more small talk, I'm thinking about

that man from the bar and his cat-like eyes. I’m about to call Jude when I’m stopped in my

tracks. There’s no way this could actually happen, but you’re looking at me and I’m looking at

you. You give me a smirk and I’m too stunned to go after you, but there’s no need because

you’re walking towards me. I’m thinking so many thoughts right now: what if you’re dangerous,

what if you’re not, I should really just continue on my way home, but what if what if… Your

eyes are so green close up, that they’re almost emerald. You seem so familiar to me in a way I

can’t describe. You seem safe and like I could trust you with any secret I’ve ever had. “I hope

you know I’m not stalking you, I never have been stalking you,” you say. I just feel like this is

fate of some kind. “Why do I feel like I know you though?” I ask. We have met before, even

before the bar I think. And then it hits me all at once.

I’m able to see you whenever I want because you’re not real. You’re made up all from my

imagination, from words on paper. The man I dreamt up one night when my cursor was blinking

back at me. I didn’t have a plot or even an idea, but I had one character. And I gave you green

eyes that were so green close up they were emerald. I blink once. I blink twice. And then you’re

gone. Gone forever? I don’t know, I feel like you’ll still show up every now and then though.

When I finally have an idea for that story maybe and open the page back up and see the cursor

once again blinking back at me. But the only words I’ll see on that page are green eyes so green

they were emerald.

I look in the mirror for the last time before I head out, I’m nervous but excited at the

same time. Not sure why I should be nervous, I mean I’m going on a date with someone I’ve

been with for exactly a year now. Surprisingly he doesn't have green eyes I think and laugh a

little to myself. I never did finish that story so you just sit on that page with only one quality to

you. That’s okay though because you weren’t real and you never would have been either. I look

up in the mirror to fix my hair quickly and as I do, I catch a glimpse of green eyes looking at me

and the formation of a smirk before I blink and you’re gone.",1,1770181215.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

but every time i check canvas, i’m missing an assignment. the deadlines are so strict that once something is due, it’s locked. they don’t even mention assignments in class sometimes. i sometimes don’t find out about assignments until i am checking my grades and see that i have several zeros for assignments that are now locked and can no longer be submitted. i shouldn’t be upset. we’re all adults and we aren’t in high school. but i can’t keep up. i’m not lazy, i swear. i’ve never been the best student in high school. i barely graduated. but i’m really trying now. i’m trying so hard and i can’t keep up. i’m drowning in work and all of my other classmates seem to be fine, yet i’m the only one who can’t seem to keep up with school.

i write reminders and notes and sticky notes and stick them to my laptop screen and set reminders on my phone and i wake up at 6 am and go to bed at 3 or 4 am every night to do my work. sometimes (most of the times) i pull all nighters. i drink coffee to stay awake in class. even though coffee makes me anxious, i do it to stay awake so i can get the info i need to do my assignments. but it’s not enough.

i’ve been lying to the older adults in my life and i said that college has been easy for me and that i’m on top of my assignments and handling the workload well. i lied and said that the stricter deadlines actually make it easier for me to get my work done. i keep lying to everyone around me saying that i’m not struggling at all and that u love college. but the truth is is that i hate it. i can’t do it. i seem to be the only one who cries over the difficulty level. i’m so overwhelmed. i’m so in over my head and it’s only four classes.

i just don’t know what to do. my professors aren’t going to reopen assignments or keep giving extensions just because i forgot about them. but i’m so overwhelmed. i’m trying my hardest but it’s not enough. i don’t know what i can do anymore. i’m so tired. 

all i can do is cry nowadays. i don’t have time for eating. i use my 15 minute breaks to do work. i don’t have time to sleep. i stay up all night doing work. but i can never keep up. i just get further behind.

i feel pathetic whining about this. college is hard. i need to suck it up. but there are days where i contemplate running in front of a semi on the highway just so that i can get an extension on some of my assignments. i’m so so so tired. i don’t know how much longer i can do this. i feel so tired. i’m stressed all the time. on the occasions that i do sleep, i wake up with small rashes nowadays from stress. my hair is starting to fall out and i lost weight— probably the only good thing to come out of college. but in all honesty, i cannot do this anymore. i don’t know how much longer i’m gonna last here if it’s barely been a month.",2,1770181110.0,Vent,4,0.75,False
1qvfdwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/1qvfdwx/cafe_advertisement_on_campus/,Cafe Advertisement on campus,"Hello! I work for a cafe near UTD and I was wondering how I would advertise the cafe? Do I need special permission to post flyers up near the SU, dorms, and whatnot? I know there's a few corkboards in like the upper floor of the SU, the sciences building, and I've seen a few posters on the pillars inside of the SLC.  
Outside of that, are there ways to have the cafe do a little station in the plinth or something? Or maybe a little table in the SU selling some stuff?  
Is there anything else we could do?   
Sorry about the flair, I didn't know what to tag this as.  
If anyone is curious, the cafe is called Turbo Coffee and Cocktails! It's about 10 minutes away from campus, we just released our Valentines day menu with a few cocktails (one with a whole chocolate strawberry) and a few coffee/nonalcoholic drinks!",2,1770181061.0,utdallas,0,0.75,False

First off I didnt add a flair bc im kinda cool with any of them (except for sports I guess). Im down for long term, short term, into videogames, queer, and an animal lover. So take your pick!

I have been inside because of some cold weather and live alone so I have been craving some conversation and friends and this seemed like a good place to go. Im new to this so I guess ill just blab about myself lol

I am pretty introverted but love people if that makes sense, and I get along with just about everyone. I think I naturally kinda feed off of other people's energy and give it back to them which ends up working well. Im almost always in a great mood. I greet people with ""happy tuesday"" etc because I think its a pleasure to be in this world every day. Ive gotten teased a few times by coworkers for that being my catchphrase at this point lol. Also I am a huge animal lover (have a cat) and also vegan. I try to show love and respect to all critters if I can.

I'm a chef/culinary teacher. I didnt think I would end up in a educational kind of position but it kinda fell into my lap and I've been liking it. Cooking is definitly the job for me but im not sure if its my """"dream job"""". I find myself watching videos about physics or architecture or engineering and get excited to try to explain how crazy some stuff out there is.

For hobbies I like to rock climb, play and write music but mainly guitar, cook (obviously), bike, and play some games, either videogames or tabletop (roguelikes, dnd, a few shooters, and other). I find myself enjoying time out the most if im out in the city, coffee shops, hanging out with friends and family, and eating great food.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading my wall of text lol. I tried to list off anything about myself that came to mind but if you have any questions let me know and im looking forward to saying hi :)",2,1770180924.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1qvfb7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qvfb7p/my_local_charity_put_something_alive_inside_me/,My Local Charity Put Something Alive Inside Me,"I’m making this post because I can't sleep, or eat, or do anything in my day to day life anymore. I have tremors in my hands, a constant taste of pennies in the back of my throat, and a scar on my ribcage that opens when I press it. I’m writing it down because the second I stop thinking about it, it forces me to remember it with everything I do.

I got the job because I needed the money. That’s it. I was broke, my lease was up, and I couldn't keep digging through my couch for loose change to try and eat everyday. My cousin knew a guy who knew a guy who managed a place called Hollow Willow Outreach. It sounded like a church but with better branding.

They did “community support,” such as food drives, counseling, and addiction recovery. A place for people who didn’t have anyone or anything. They had a nice building, clean carpets, free coffee, and the kind of calm faces that make you lower your voice without thinking.

I showed up in a button-up that didn’t  fit quite right and tried to act like I wasn’t desperate for a couple bucks. A young woman at the front desk smiled at me too hard. It felt practiced. “Are you here for the intake?” she asked, like this was a normal way to say “new hire.” “Im here for the interview,” I said. She tilted her head. “Ah. The helping intake.” I met the director, Eliot Rooske. He was maybe forty-ish, one of those men who keep their hair perfect and their voice so soft you can’t put an age on them. He wore a plain sweater and a copper wedding band that was definitely too small for him, almost like it was meant for someone else’s finger. He shook my hand with both of his. “You have very kind eyes,” he said. No one has ever told me that. I laughed awkwardly. “I’m.. um..good with people,” I gulped. He studied my face like he was reading it. The whole time, his smile didn’t change, warm, simple, like a painting. “We don’t pay much,” he said. “But we do feed you. We keep you. We help you become… whole.”

This is where I definitely should've known something was up, and I should’ve left, but the building was warm, the coffee was free, and Eliot looked at me like he was proud of me for just existing.

I started the next Monday.

My first week was incredibly boring. I answered phones, stocked shelves , and drove donation boxes to storage. The people who came in were exactly what you’d expect: tired, empty, and twitchy. Some were kind, some were mean in that way people get when they’re hungry for something that isn’t food. The staff… the staff were too nice. They didn’t gossip, they didn’t complain, they didn’t swear, they laughed quietly, like loud joy was disrespectful. They all wore the same little pin on their shirts, a circle with a stake through it.
I asked one guy, Matt, what it meant. He touched it with his fingertip like it was fragile.
“Correction,” he said. “It helps you remember who we’re supposed to be.” “Like… spiritually?” He smiled. “like biologically.” He said it like a joke, but his eyes didn’t move. 

At the end of my first week, Eliot asked me to stay late. The building emptied out, lights dimmed, the hum of the vending machine was corrupting the silence. Eliot led me down a hallway I hadn’t been down yet. We passed offices, passed a locked door with a keypad, passed a wall of framed photos of smiling people holding those pins. The air changed the farther we went,  colder, and more humid, like the inside of a refrigerator.

He stopped at another keypadded door. “Staff only,” the sign above read. “You’re staff.” He said, still smiling. He punched in a code without looking at the pad. The door clicked open. The hallway beyond was unfinished concrete and bare drywall. The smell me  hit like fucking train, bleach and iron, like pennies and pool water. Somewhere far down the corridor, something dripped, slowly. 

Drip. 
Drip. 
Drip.

I stopped walking. “What is this place?” I asked. Eliot turned, with that damned smile. “This is where we do the work that can’t be done in the sunlight.” My mouth became dry and I managed to choke up a chuckle. “Okay. Is this like… AA stuff? Group therapy?” He looked genuinely confused, almost like I was speaking another language. “No,” he said softly. “This is where we help you become whole.” He put his hand on my shoulder and gripped tight , then guided me forward.
 
We reached a room that looked like a hospital room, if a hospital room was designed by someone who’d only seen one in a nightmare.

There were clean stainless steel tables, cabinets with glass doors, a rolling cart with instruments laid out neatly, scalpels, clamps, sutures, needles far too long to be used on anything human, and in the center, bolted to the floor, was a chair. Not a dentist chair. Not a recliner. A heavy duty, industrial chair with arm restraints and foot straps. Like it belonged in an old looney bin. The leather was dark, cracked, and stained all over.

My mouth became dry again. “Is this some kind of… sick fucking prank?!” I said. My own voice sounded so far away. Eliot’s hand stayed on my shoulder. His fingers were ice cold. “We don’t prank silly,” he said. “We correct God's mistakes.” He walked to one of the cabinets and opened it. Inside were many jars. Not like mason jars with pickles. Thick glass jars with metal clamps, filled with yellow fluid. Chunky items floated in them like pale fruit. I saw what looked like a swollen finger, a slab of skin with black hair still on it, and a jar full of what looked like ears. My vision narrowed. I could hear my heartbeat like a war drum trying to thump its way out of my chest.

“Eliot,” I said shakily, and I hated how small my voice was. “What the hell is this?” He closed the cabinet so softly it didn't make a click sound, like he didn’t want to upset the jars. “You’ve been living,” he said, “with gaps.”

“What?”

He stepped closer. “Everyone has gaps. We are all born… misaligned. You can feel it, can’t you? That feeling like something inside you is missing. That you’re walking around every day with a cavity that can't be filled.”
I didn’t answer, because the sick part is, he wasn’t wrong. I’ve had that feeling my whole life. Like there’s a hole inside me.

Eliot smiled wider, and for the first time, it looked strained. “We fill the gaps,” he said. “We make people whole.”

He pointed to the chair. “Sit.” I couldn't move.
His voice didn’t change. Still soft. Still kind.
“Sit,” he repeated, and something in the air seemed to lean toward me. Like the room itself was listening. “I’m getting the fuck out of here,” I said, even though my legs didn’t move. Eliot sighed, like I disappointed him.
“I was really hoping you wouldn’t fight,” he said. “You have very kind eyes. People with kind eyes make the best vessels. They don’t hold on so tight.” “Vessels,” I echoed, because my brain was latching onto words. He nodded excitedly. “For the correction.”

The next part is embarrassing. I don’t like admitting it. I didn’t get tackled. No one jumped out from behind a curtain and grabbed me. Eliot didn’t start waving a gun around. He just looked at me, and said, “You’re safe here,” and my body started to work against me, like I was put into some kind of trance with those three words.

I sat in the chair. I hate myself for it. I still do.
The restraints clicked shut. One of the staff members came in a woman, maybe thirty, hair pulled tight, same pin on her shirt. She didn’t speak. She checked my wrists and ankles like she was tucking a child into bed. “Wait,” I said, trying to lift my arms, but they were already locked so tight any movement felt like the restraints would cut into me.

Eliot leaned in close. His breath smelled like mint. “Don’t be afraid,” he giggled. “Fear makes the seam rough.”

“What seam-”

The woman took a syringe from the cart, It had to have been the thickest needle. It looked like it belonged in an animal tranquilizer kit. I tried to jerk away, but the chair held tight. The more I pulled and moved the more the metal restraints bit and cut.
“Stop,” I cried. “Stop. I didn’t sign up for this. I’m calling the fucking police, and when they get here they will wipe that shit eating grin of your face!” Eliot stared into my soul with those dark green eyes and crazed smile. “Your phone is upstairs,” he said calmly

The needle went into my arm. The cold flooded my veins. Not like numbing, like winter lake water. My fingers tingled, then went heavy. My tongue felt too big in my mouth.

The room blurred at the edges, but the center stayed sharp, too sharp. I could see every crack on Eliot’s lips, every tiny scratch on the metal straps, and every speck of dust that floated into the light.

I tried to scream and all that came out was a wet moan. “Good,” Eliot murmured. “You’re still present. That’s important.”

He pulled on gloves. The woman wheeled the cart closer. Metal clinked. Eliot picked up a tool, not a scalpel. Something shaped like a thin, curved hook with a handle. Like a crochet needle from hell. “Where are you-” I tried again, but my words slurred.

Eliot pressed his cold, long, fingers against my sternum, right in the center of my chest, and I felt something in me respond. Not pain, not yet, more like pressure, like something inside recognized his touch. “Here,” he said softly. “Your gap is here. I can feel it. A little hollow. A little gap. That means only a little correction.”

My heartbeat sped up so fast it felt like it was trying to leap up my throat and into my lap.

He placed the hook against my skin.I expected a cut. I expected a sting. Instead, the hook sank into me like I was made of warm wax. I couldn’t process it. My brain rejected it. The hook slid into my chest without any resistance, and I felt it inside me ,rummaging around gently like a finger stirring soup. A sound came out of me that I didn’t recognize as mine. A small, animalistic noise.
Eliot’s eyes closed, like he was listening to music. 

“There you are silly,” he giggled. “Do you feel it? God's mistake!” The hook rotated and caught on to something inside me. He tugged.
 My body responded, not with blood, but with movement. My chest's skin bulged outward in a line, like something beneath it was being pulled toward the surface. It looked like a zipper being drawn from the inside. I could feel it. A tearing sensation, but not like ripping flesh. Like separating two things that had been stuck together like old velcro. Eliot continued to yank and pull.

My sternum split. It didn't crack or snap, it was one straight line from the base of my throat down to my stomach, a seam appeared and parted. My skin peeled back in two neat flaps, revealing not organs, not ribs, but something else entirely. A cavity. A smooth, glistening interior, pale pink, lined with fine, vibrating hairs like the inside of a dog’s ear.

It pulsed.
It breathed.
It was waiting.

I tried to throw up, but my stomach was strapped in. My mouth filled with saliva and I swallowed it in with panicked gulps. Eliot smiled like a proud father. “See?” he said. “You were made with mistakes.”

The woman opened a cabinet behind him. I heard glasses clink and liquid slosh. She returned holding a jar. Inside floated something that looked like a thick knot of pale tissue, fibrous, and threaded with veins. It wasn’t an organ I recognized. It was too symmetrical, like it had been grown in a lab. Little pores dotted its surface, and each one pulsed erratically, like it was excited.

Eliot took the jar with reverence. “This,” he said, “is what will correct you, correct the mistakes that god has bestowed upon you.”

He opened it.

The smell punched my nostrils, it smelled like sweet rot and antiseptic, like flowers left in a hospital room too long.

He reached in with his gloved hand and lifted that thing out. It dripped yellow, viscous fluid down his wrist. The pores quivered, reacting to the air, to the light, and to me.

I started to sob. Silently, because my body couldn’t make any more sound. “Please,” I begged through my breath. “Please don’t.”
Eliot looked genuinely sad. “Oh,” he whispered. “You think this is harmful.” He leaned in, holding the thing above my open chest. “This is your correction,” he said. “This is our love. This is being made whole.”

He lowered it into my cavity.

The moment it touched me, my entire body arched against the restraints, cutting into my wrists even deeper. Warm, crimson red dripped off the arms of the chair.

Drip.
Drip.
Drip.

Pain exploded through my nerves, not sharp, not burning but invasive. Like a thousand tiny fingers pushing into places they didn’t belong. The furs latched onto inside me, and I felt them connect. Suck. Fuse.

My vision went white.

Somewhere far away, a low hum began, like a choir warming up. Except it wasn’t outside.

It was in my bones.

Eliot’s voice seemed to come from what sounded like underwater. “Breathe,” he said. “Let it settle.” I couldn’t breathe. My lungs locked. The thing inside me pulsed, and with each pulse, my ribs felt like they were being violently rearranged. Not broken, but shifted like they were being shuffled into a different pattern. I felt a pop beneath my collarbone. Then another. Then the wet, soft, warm sensation of something growing where it shouldn’t. My throat made a choking sound and something warm ran down my chin. Blood, dark and thick.

The hum grew louder, and I realized it had words. Not words I understood, words that sounded like someone trying to speak through water and teeth at the same time.

Eliot stepped back, hands lifted, eyes shining.
“Yes,” he breathed. “Yes. You hear it.” I heard it. I hated that I heard it, because underneath the pain, underneath the terror, there was a sensation like relief. Like a pressure you didn’t realize you were carrying, finally being let out.
Like scratching an itch you’ve had since birth.
The thing inside me pulsed again, and this time my body responded automatically.

My mouth opened.
And I spoke.
Not English.
Not anything I’d ever learned.

A wet, layered sound came out of my throat, like two voices stacked on top of each other. I felt it vibrate in my teeth. In my sinuses. In the seam of my chest. Eliot’s face went slack with joy, like he’d been waiting years for that very sound. The woman beside him bowed her head. Eliot whispered, “Welcome.”

I blacked out.

When I woke up, my shirt was back on. My chest wasn't open, but there was a scar.
Not a normal scar, thin and pale, perfectly straight down the center of my torso, like someone had stitched me shut with invisible thread. I was in one of the upstairs counseling rooms on a couch with a blanket tucked around me like I had just come down with a cold. A cup of water was on the table. Eliot sat across from me with his hands folded. I shot upright so fast my vision swam.
“What did you do,” I said, and my voice was hoarse, scratchy, like I’d been screaming for hours. Eliot’s expression was gentle, almost amused. “We helped you,” he said. “You did beautifully.” I clutched my shirt and yanked it up. The scar stared back at me. My skin around it looked… stretched. Slightly raised, like there was something underneath pressing outward.

I pressed my fingers on it.
It pushed back.
Not like swelling.
Like something breathing.

I scrambled off the couch, stumbling toward the door. It was unlocked. Of course it was. They didn’t need locks. I clumsily ran through the building, out into the cold air, half expecting someone to tackle me, to drag me back downstairs.

No one followed.

The street outside was normal. Cars passed. A man walked his Bassett Hound. The sky was an ugly winter gray. I almost cried from how normal it all was. I got in my car and drove. I don’t even remember where. I just drove until my hands cramped from gripping the wheel so long. That night, I tried to convince myself it was a nightmare. I took a shower so hot my skin turned red. I scrubbed my chest until it stung. I stood in front of the mirror and told myself scars don’t breathe. Then I heard it. A faint hum, deep in my ribcage. Like a lullaby. I pressed my palm to my chest and felt it vibrate under my skin, and something inside me shifted, like it was getting comfortable. I didn’t go to the hospital.

How do I tell anyone this? “Hi, I think a nonprofit organization opened my body like a jacket and put a new organ in me that sings?” They’d sedate me. Strap me down. Cut me open. And if they found anything, if they touched it.  I don’t know what it would do. So I did what people do when they’re afraid. I pretended it wasn’t real. I went back to work.
I told myself I’d go to the police. I told myself I’d record it, gather evidence, burn the fucking place down if I had to. 

I walked into Hollow Willow Outreach the next day with a knot of dread hanging in my stomach. The woman at the front desk smiled.
“Feeling better?” she asked.

I froze.

“How did you-”

She tilted her head like before.
“Your seam is cleaner today,” she said, and went back to typing. I backed away and nearly ran into Matt. He looked at me with bright, shining eyes. “You heard it,” he whispered through his smile. I swallowed hard. “What the fuck is it.” He touched his own pin. “Correction,” he said again. “Now you understand how you’re supposed to be.”
I tried to quit that day. I tried to tell Eliot I was leaving. He listened patiently in his office like a therapist. When I finally ran out of words, he smiled wider. “You can go,” he said. Relief hit me so hard my knees went weak. Then he added, calmly, “But you’ll come back.” I stared at him.

“I won’t.”

Eliot leaned forward. “You will,” he said, still soft. “Because the gap is corrected now, and it doesn’t like being alone.” I laughed, sharp and desperate. “You've lost your damn mind.” Eliot’s eyes flicked briefly to my chest. “You haven’t slept,” he said. “You’ve been hearing it, and soon you’ll start to taste it.” My mouth filled with a penny taste, offering proof. He sat back. “We don’t trap people,” he said. “We correct them. The world does the trapping. We just… open the seam.” I left. I didn’t come back. For two weeks, I tried to live like normal. I went to work at a different job. I ate. I watched TV. I texted friends. I laughed at jokes and pretended my laughter didn’t have a second echo underneath it. At night, the humming got louder. It started to have rhythms. Patterns. It began to sync with my breathing, like it was training me. Sometimes, right as I drifted off, I’d feel it push against my ribs and I would jolt awake, gasping, with my hands gripping at my chest like I was trying to hold myself closed.

Then came the dreams. Always the same hallway of concrete. The chair. The instruments, and a door at the end of the hall I hadn’t noticed before. In my dream, I always walked toward it. I always reached for the handle, and right before I could touch it, I’d wake up with my chest itching so badly I’d scratch until my nails broke skin. One night, I woke up with blood and fragments of skin under my fingernails and a thin line down my sternum that hadn’t been there when I fell asleep.

Not a cut.
A seam.

Barely visible at first. Like my skin had been pressed together and was starting to come apart. I stumbled to the bathroom mirror and pulled my shirt up with shaking hands. The scar was there, but now it looked active. The skin around it puckered like lips. I touched it and it quivered under my finger. The hum rose in response, like it was pleased, almost like a purring cat. I gagged. I splashed water on my face, and I tried to breathe, and then I heard something else. A sound from my own chest that wasn’t humming. A quiet, wet click. Like something unlatching. The seam twitched, and for a second, only a second it opened a hair’s width. I felt cold air touch something inside me that had never felt air before.

My knees slammed onto the tile.
I sat there, hunched over, holding myself like I was trying to keep my insides from falling out.
I understood, very clearly, that this was not a scar. 

This was a door.

After that, it got worse fast. Food started tasting wrong. Anything with meat made my stomach twist in knots. I started craving things that weren’t food, salty, metallic, sharp. Once, while doing dishes, I stared at a box of razor blades under the sink for so long I forgot what I was doing. The hum would change when I was near certain people. It would be quiet around strangers, like it was hiding. It would swell around anyone wearing that stupid little pin, even if they were across a grocery store aisle. 

The day I saw Matt again, it nearly tore me open.I was walking downtown, trying to keep busy, when I heard a voice behind me.

“You’re fraying.”
I spun around.

Matt stood there like he’d been waiting. He wore his pin. His eyes looked too bright, too awake. I took a step back. “Don’t.” He held his hands out, palms up. “We’re worried,” he said. “Eliot says you’re suffering.” “I’m not-” My chest seized. A pressure built behind my sternum like someone pushing from inside with both fists. I gasped and clutched my shirt. Matt’s eyes softened. “It hates being ignored,” he said. “It hates being alone.” The seam burned. I felt the skin on my chest start to separate, not from an external cut, but from within, like it remembered how easily it could open. I stumbled backward, bumping into a lamppost. People around us didn’t notice,  or if they did, they looked away too quickly, like their eyes slid off me. Matt stepped closer. “You can fight it,” he murmured. “Or you can come back and let us tend to you. The seam can get infected if you force it shut.” I made a sound that might’ve been a laugh, but it broke halfway through into a sob. “I don’t want this,” I choked. Matt’s voice went softer. “No one wants correction,” he said. “But once you’ve been filled you don’t get to go back to being empty.” My seam fluttered. I felt it. Not like an injury. Like a mouth trying to speak. And then, right there on the sidewalk, my chest opened. Not fully. Just a thin split down the scar line, a wet, gleaming chunk of skin peeked into the outside world. The air hit it and the humming turned into a thrilled, hungry vibration that made my teeth ache. Matt stared at it with something like reverence. “Oh,” he whispered. “It’s calling. I slammed my hands over it, pressing hard enough to hurt. I don’t know how I got away. I don’t remember. I just remember running, hand clamped to my chest, feeling something inside me pulse against my palm like a heartbeat that wasn’t mine. 

That night, I barricaded my door. I taped my shirt down with duct tape, like that would help. I sat on my bed with a kitchen knife in my hand, shaking. I told myself if it opened, I’d cut it out. I told myself I’d rip myself apart before I let them have me. Somewhere around 3 a.m., the humming stopped. The silence was worse. I held my breath, and listened.
 
A deafening groan erupted from my chest. The seam on my chest began to open. I took my shot. I gripped the knife hard and gritted my teeth before sinking the blade into my own chest, that same feeling like cutting into warm wax. I pressed harder and further pushing against the parasite. It let out a symphony of screams and cries. My legs went weak and buckled. I didn't care if I cut past the demon that lived in my chest as long as I didn't have to give myself to that thing. I took the blade half way out so I could punch it with the piercing point on my cold steel savior. 

Crunch.
Snap.

A blinding hot pain exploded from within me. In my horror both of my top ribs were facing outward, points of blood and mucus-covered bone were sticking out of my skin. We let out a synchronized blood curdling scream. I jammed the knife back in with what little strength I had left, I felt the blade puncture its rubbery membrane. A geyser of yellow and red fluids sprayed from the seam, tearing the edges as it sprayed my bedroom's carpet. I don't know how long I sat on that bedroom floor with a knife sticking half way out of me and covered in that fluid that smelled like antiseptic-rot.

When I pulled the knife out, the parasite let out a soft whimper, before my seam slowly closed with little wet snaps and pops.


Then I heard it. A knock at my door. Not loud. Not urgent. Polite. I didn’t move. My whole body went cold. The knife shook in my grip.
Another knock. Then a voice through the wood, calm and warm. “You didn't kill it, you only wounded it and made it angrier with you. That was a mistake.,” it said. I didn’t respond. The voice continued, like it knew I was there. “We brought you something,” Eliot said. “To soothe you both.” I swallowed hard, tasting pennies. The hum started again, faint, like it was waking up. My chest scar tingled. “Go away,” I groaned. Eliot laughed softly. “I understand,” he said. “It feels like you're losing a battle and you are correct.”

A pause. Then, gently, “But you were never correct to begin with.” The doorknob turned.
I’d locked it. I’d chained it. I’d shoved a chair under it. The knob turned anyway. The chain rattled as if someone was lifting it from the outside with careful fingers. My chest seam burned hot, hot as lava. The humming swelled into a choir.

This is the part that makes me most feel sick writing all this, is that the thing inside me wasn’t afraid.

It was excited.

The door creaked open. Eliot stepped in like he belonged there, like he was visiting a friend. Behind him were two others in plain sweaters. The woman from downstairs, and Matt. They all wore their pins.
Eliot held a jar in his hands. Inside was another one of those pale, twitching knots. “This is for you,” he said. I tried to stand, tried to run, but my legs didn’t work right. My body felt heavy, like gravity had doubled. Eliot’s gaze dropped to my chest.“Ah,” he whispered, almost tender. “You poor thing, how bad did this bad, bad man hurt you?” My hands clung to my shirt. The duct tape had started peeling away on its own, curling like dead skin. The seam beneath it pulsed. Eliot stepped closer. “I told you,” he said softly. “You would come back.” “I didn’t,” I whispered. “You came here.” Eliot smiled. “We’re not separate,” he said. “Not anymore.” He reached out. The moment his fingers touched my sternum, my chest opened like it wanted him. The seam parted wide, skin folding back neatly. The pale interior glistened, vibrating with hunger. I screamed but it sounded wrong, layered, like something else screamed with me. Eliot leaned in, eyes shining. “You see?” he whispered. “It recognizes family.” God, I hate this, Matt stepped forward and lifted his own shirt. He had the same seam. The same scar. He opened it with two fingers, casually, like unzipping a jacket. Inside him, I saw it. 

Not just one knot. Several. A whole cluster of pale, pulsing organs stacked and intertwined, stitched into him like a grotesque bouquet of tumors, some of them had grown outward, pressing against his ribs so his chest looked subtly reshaped. His skin stretched thin over certain bulges. His hum was louder than mine. More confident. He smiled at me with wet eyes. “It hurts at first,” he whispered. “Then it feels like being loved.” Eliot raised the jar. “Open wider,” he told me gently. My body obeyed. I felt the seam tear wider. I felt the interior hairs vibrate in anticipation. I felt myself make room. My mind screamed no, but my body, my door said yes. Eliot lowered the new beast towards me, and I saw something I hadn’t noticed before, the pores on it weren’t just twitching. They were shaped like tiny mouths. Little puckered openings that flexed and tasted the air. The thing inside me surged toward them. My chest cavity rippled, like a throat swallowing.

Eliot smiled, delighted. “Easy,” he murmured. “Help him, Help your family and take what is rightfully yours. Correction.” The moment the new knot touched my interior, it latched. The tiny mouths sealed against the vibrating hairs with wet clicks. Pain flashed, sharp and hot, but underneath it was that horrible relief again, like scratching a lifelong itch until you bleed and you're still wanting more. I felt it connect, and then I felt it spread. Threads shot out from it, thin as hair but strong, burrowing into me. They wrapped around my ribs, around my lungs, around my heart like snakes seeking a rodent . Each thread pulled, gently, firmly, rearranging me. I choked, gasping. Eliot watched like a proud artist. “Perfect,” he laughed hysterically. “You’re taking them so well.” Matt stepped closer, voice shaking with excitement. “Do you hear it?” he asked. I did. Not just humming now. Voices. Many voices. Some in my bones. Some in my teeth. Some in the seam itself, whispering in wet, layered syllables. I realized the words weren’t random. They were instructions. Directions. A map. 

Eliot leaned close enough that his breath wet my cheek. “You’re going to help us,” he whispered. “Because you’re correct now.”
I tried to shake my head, but my neck felt too heavy. Eliot’s hand slid down my open seam and rested inside me like he belonged there, palm pressed against the pulsing knot. He closed his eyes. “I can feel it,” he murmured. “It likes you. It’s growing fast.” Something under my left rib shifted. A bulge pressed outward, round and firm, like a fist pushing from inside. I screamed again. The bulge moved. It traveled under my skin, sliding upward like a thing crawling beneath a blanket. It reached my collarbone and stopped. Then it pushed. My skin stretched, went white, then split in a thin line as something sharp pressed out. Not bone. Not metal. A pale, wet spike emerged, covered in clear mucus, like a tooth growing where no tooth belonged. Eliot opened his eyes and smiled. “A marker,” he whispered. “You’re becoming visible.” Matt stared, tears streaming. “You’re so lucky,” he breathed. I couldn’t breathe. My chest was a living door, my body rearranging itself around a parasite that felt like love if love was a trap.

Eliot withdrew his hand and finally, gently, pushed my skin flaps closed. The seam zipped itself shut with a series of wet clicks.

The scar sealed, smooth and pale. Except now there was a lump under it. Multiple lumps. Like knots under fabric.

Eliot patted my chest like he was soothing a pet. “You’ll feel sore,” he said. “Drink water. Avoid sharp objects. Don’t pick at your seam. Dont let him hurt you ever again.” He stood, straightening his sweater, calm as ever. “We’ll see you tomorrow,” he said. Then they left. Just like that. My door closed, but the hum didn’t stop. It never stops now.

Here’s the part I’m stuck on, the part that makes my hands shake as I type, they didn’t need to restrain me anymore because when they were gone, and I was alone in my room, I sat on the edge of my bed and listened to the choir in my ribs, and my first thought wasn’t how do I get this out. My first thought was, what if they’re right? What if I was missing something? What if the horrible relief is the only honest feeling I’ve had in years? That’s when I knew I was in real trouble, because I don’t trust myself now. I don’t trust the way my body leans toward certain places when I walk past them. I don’t trust the way my hands drift to my chest in my sleep. I don’t trust the way my mouth waters when I smell blood, even my own, and I don’t trust the thing inside me that’s learning my routines.

Two days ago, I woke up with my shirt folded neatly on the floor.  My scar was exposed, and there were fingerprints around it. Not mine. Small, damp prints, like someone with wet hands had pressed against my sternum and tested the seam. Last night, I found one of those pins on my kitchen counter. I don’t remember picking it up. I don’t remember going outside, but it was there. A circle with a stake going vertically through it.

Correction.

I threw it in the trash. I took the trash outside immediately. This morning, it was back on my counter. 

Clean. 
Dry.
Waiting.

So I’m writing this now because I need someone ,anyone to know that if you see Hollow Willow Outreach, if you see their food drives or their smiling volunteers or their little pins, you do not go inside. You do not let them touch you. You do not accept their coffee (no matter how good it smells), and if you’ve ever had that feeling like there’s an empty space inside you, like you’re walking around with a hole inside you. Please.

Please understand that there are people out there who can fill that gap, and they don’t see it as pain. They see it as an invitation. The last thing Eliot said to me, quiet, and warm, like a blessing, keeps replaying in my head.

“You’ll come back”. The worst part is, I don’t know if he meant me.

Or the things that are trying to slither and claw there way out of my chest.

It is an exceptionally regal fragrance, hard for me to describe it other than it smells of wealth and class. The notes are blended so well, it’s an ambery spicy very refined smell. The vanilla dry down is not overly sweet. Very elegant well put together smell that I can’t wait to wear in the coming days. The test sprays I put on my arm 6 hours ago are wafting into the air in the most immaculate scent bubble any time I move. Seriously 10/10

Caden I had just finished up a sample of and enjoyed enough for a FB , kept catching whiffs of the coffee in the dry down and it’s insanely addictive. Such a good smoky leather coffee/ tarred sugar smelling fragrance. Incredible projection and longevity 10/10

Samples of Beach Hut Man and Guidance 46 both surprised me in a great way, as much as I’ve heard about BH , wasn’t expecting the smell, very unique and interesting, smells like muddled mint laying on a ripened but drying banana peel. Need a full bottle of it asap , it’s a smell that tells a story and creates vivid imagery of a time and place I can’t wait picture but haven’t been. Like a memory that isn’t yours but you are oddly familiar with. 

Guidance 46, in short, smells very vibrant and beautiful, very sweet , a bit too sweet for me personally, I think I’d enjoy smelling this in the air more than on myself or my wife but it is very pleasant

Tuxedo (not Niche) , have had a 10ml I ran out of and just ordered another , still debating on if a full bottle is worth it, longevity isn’t as good as I’d like it for the price but it’s a lovely smell

1qvf8ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1qvf8ya/relationships_grow_when_you_water_them_but/,"Relationships grow when you water them, but regular pruning is also healthy in the long run","I broke up with a friend this week, and I feel conflicted about it.

We were different people when we met, and I genuinely felt so inspired by her. She's older by just over 10 years. She felt more like a support that a true peer. I was studying to be a registered nurse and had many days free to go rock climbing and meet up for coffee and bushwalking. She worked hard at her job but had free time too. We had some fantastic times together.

Last year I graduated and began working as a nurse and found myself battling exhaustion and mental health troubles combined with this new, very difficult job. I had my partner to support me. I felt myself wanting to stay home more and eat and sleep. My friend and I booked trips with the mutual group we were a part of. I bailed many times in the weeks leading up to the events because I just didn't have the energy. Not because I didn't want to go. It also became way too burdensome to go to weekly climbing nights, with 30-40 minute drives and the energy expended, so I stopped going. We hung out a few times doing lower energy things, but I think they quickly grew bored of that. Never did they offer to drive down to my local area.



She had annual leave and went travelling a lot. I couldn't get the time off, and frankly I have been too depressed and burnt out to get together the spark for a holiday. She had time with her annual leave to pop by mine for a coffee. Nothing.



One of our friends had a baby which was super exciting. I was thrilled for them. Then my friend wants to have a baby now too. Exciting! One reversed vasectomy and a failed IVF treatment later, she's not pregnant. This must have been very hard on them, I never texted and asked how it was going. I was preoccupied with my own struggles.



Final straw this weekend just gone. I was late, but as if she's never been late before. The whole 2-hour hang out was thick with this heavy energy. She never smiled at me. She seemed angry with me when she was packing to go. I apologised for being absent this past year.  



I broke up with her over text a few days later, but not without many tears. I spoke about how I hadn't felt very good hanging out with them lately, and my own struggles have made me pretty selfish with what little precious energy I have in the day. 

  
She told me that she was ""Sang froid"" about the whole situation. She seemed more angry than sad that I wasn't as committed to this relationship as she wanted me to be. She told me that it was clear that I wasn't motivated by people very much, and that I prioritised my boyfriend to a fault. If she was so cool about the situation, why on earth would you lash out like that?

She complained that I had withdrawn so much over the past year, so she had noticed my struggles with depression, but didn't provide me any grace?

We went our own ways. I've deleted them all off socials to give me distance to grieve.

And that was that.

I know I sound like the asshole in this situation. It's probably because I am. But I never thought we were best, deepest, forever BFFs. My partner termed it ""fair weather friends"". And neither of us have had fair weather consistently lately. 



In the end, I was sad that this friendship has broken down, but also it is a bit of a blessing because I have discovered that she lacks the self insight and reflection to realise that she expected so much more from her friends than she was willing to give to me. We were both equally absent from each other through both of our respective struggles. What if I tried to rely on her when things truly hit the fan?

  
It's also promoted me to scroll this sub a bit and uncover a few gems of wisdom. And speak to my family about friendship and relationships and realise that I need do need to prioritise continually meeting new people as you grow and change in life.

1qvf8hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAsocial/comments/1qvf8hi/dtla_and_finding_a_sense_of_community/,DTLA and finding a sense of community?,"I got a new job and work from home (mostly) as an editor and only will be needing to go into the office only several times a month in studio city - I wanna live somewhere that brings me a sense of community and being surrounded by people. I have felt quite lonely here and isolated in quiet “safer” neighborhoods- such as eagle rock where I live now. 

For context I am a single female who is 26. Looking to find other friends of a similar demographic who are young professionals so I can just identify with them and have meaningful conversations about being in your 20s and quarter life crisis type stuff and just have real connection (not talking just about hot yoga and matcha lattes).

**A couple things that attract me to DTLA (specifically South Park/crypto arena area and SP adjacent areas):**

\- the high rises are more affordable than the ones in WEHO and Hollywood and more spacious. I love the floor to ceiling windows (my budget is 3k/month).

\- I have a hope that I could possibly make friends with other people in my building especially through the common areas that you can go and sit at to work or those swanky pools

\- I have seen people say they love that they can walk to places like coffee shops, clothing stores, museums, etc.

\- I weirdly don’t mind the noise of sirens, homeless, etc as it makes me feel less alone ?? 

**Cons that I am aware of about DTLA:**

\- obviously gritty and homeless people to be aware of but I have street smarts so not too concerned and know to obvi avoid skid row etc etc 

\- it clears out at night (less people there) so it may feel lonely after all?

\- parking is expensive and sparse so people may not wanna come over and visit ?

\- driving against traffic to get out of DTLA?

**Questions I have:**

\- are there other places that have high rises that are as affordable and swanky as DTLA that also could be a good area to make friends?

\- is DTLA South Park a good place to make friends? Have people made friends w their building mates (for lack of better words)?

\- is SP good for nightlife? I love rooftop and cocktail bars

I don’t wanna feel isolated and can’t tell if I’ll feel that or not there but “hustle and bustle” of city/SP area where people have said is the liveliest part  makes me feel as tho I won’t be. Lmk if I’m totally mistaken.",3,1770180616.0,LAsocial,5,0.81,False

When you see someone fundraising for a race (marathon, charity bib, etc.), how do you usually approach donating?

Is a small $5 “coffee money” contribution normal and appreciated…

or do you personally wait until you can give more before donating at all?

I’m running the Boston Marathon this April and fundraising for a youth athletics program, and I’m trying to do this the right way — without being pushy, awkward, or spammy.

I know training is the easy part. Fundraising is the mental marathon 😅

So I’m curious how you think about it as runners and donors:
Do small donations feel meaningful?
Does frequency matter more than amount?
What instantly turns you off when someone asks for support?

And what do I need to change about myself?","First for some context I'm 28 and going to turn 29 in a few weeks. In all that time, I never had a girlfriend, sex, first kiss, you know how it goes. Basically I just want to know if it's even possible in the first place to find someone being who I am. Also I live in Argentina (born here).

Physically I'm white, 1.71 m tall, I weight 68 kg, I'd say I have an okay face, though I still have some pimples despite my age, having a good hygiene and not eating a lot of oily food. I have brown eyes and hair, I have long straight hair (think like MoistCr1TiKaL for example). I shave my face. I don't have muscles, though I'm physically active. Overall I wouldn't describe myself as an attractive person, but I also don't think that I'm anywhere near ugly enough to be hideous, so probably about average to slightly below average.

And obviously I'm not going to post a photo of myself, I'm already posting way more personal information that I'm typically comfortable with.

In terms of style I used to dress like a punk when I was like 16 (I also rocked a mohawk back then), and then have switched to a metalhead look that I still keep to this day, though severely toned down, I mostly wear regular clothes nowadays, but I still have the long hair and a few shirts from bands.

As for my personality, I have always been very shy and introverted, I feel anxious speaking to people I don't know very well, have a lot of trouble bonding over new people and opening up to them, and even when I have known someone for a while I often have trouble trying to come up with a conversation topic. I don't feel very comfortable in groups, I usually feel like people just forget I exist in those cases.

I understand that my personality may unironically be my biggest flaw, everyone seems to agree that shy and insecure men are very unattractive, and I'm sure I come off that way. This is also something that I highly doubt I could change, and honestly I don't really want to, if it weren't such a huge detriment for getting a girlfriend, I'd be perfectly happy being the way I am.

I fare a little better in one to one interactions though, and in small groups like two or three other people.

Economically, I hardly earn any money and nearly all of it goes into paying for college, and I live with my parents with no plans of moving out in the future unless anything changes drastically, like getting a well paid job after college for example, which seems more and more unlikely with the rise of AI. I don't make enough money to take someone on a date even if anyone were willing to go with me, unless our date were going to a park to talk and drink mate, or going for a coffee. I also couldn't pay for an hotel room if anyone were willing to have sex with me.

How broke I am is what I'd consider to be my second biggest flaw.

My hobbies include motorcycle riding, cycling, running, playing videogames, watching anime / reading manga, going to punk and metal concerts, and recently DnD with some friends.

I'm currently studying in college as mentioned before, and I'm probably graduating this year.

I've tried with dating apps, or rather have been trying since I was 18, though only sporadically, I usually use them for a few months until I give up and uninstall them, and then try again a few months later. I usually don't get matches, and when I do they don't respond to my messages. I have never gone to clubs or bars, mainly because I couldn't afford it, but also because I don't think I'd be comfortable in that kind of environment being as introverted as I am.

Also, I don't use Instagram or any other social media, which I've been told is like handicapping myself in modern dating because women usually find it a red flag, like if I'm a shady guy and I have something to hide for not putting my life in display like that. Also I've been told that Instagram is maybe the main way of meeting women nowadays.

I have some artistic skills, though they need a lot of polishing (I hope to become an animator). I also have a decent understanding of mechanics and electronics, at least enough to fix a motorcycle and work on it, or fix some small electronics. Overall I'd say I'm a resourceful person in that sense.

I also have a decent understanding of computers, like I know how to build a PC, fix it, how to make a website, video editing, and of course stuff like 3D modeling and animation because of what I'm studying.

Another thing, it has never been confirmed but I suspect that I may be slightly autistic. I don't have all of the traits that are typically associated with autism, but I've never felt normal and have always struggled a lot with social interactions, like having trouble picking up the intention behind what people say, so I feel like that would explain a lot.

I've also been feeling pretty depressed lately about my nonexistent romantic life, specially with this month having both valentine's day and my birthday on it, both a reminder of how I have failed myself for yet another year while my years of youth are running out.

I've been wanting to try therapy for a while, but I won't be able to afford it for now. I only did therapy once when I was 15 because I was getting bullied at school, and honestly I didn't felt like it did anything, but I didn't go for very long either. I also wouldn't want to burden my parents with anything more, they're both pensioners so their economic situation isn't much different to mine, they're also just barely scrapping by.

I have never been very involved in politics, but I've always considered myself a leftist, and I'm pretty liberal in a social sense.

I understand that it's impossible to expect tailored advice when people don't know you, and that's how you get shit like ""you have to take a shower"". That's why I tried to describe myself to the best of my abilities, so hopefully you can have a half decent idea of who I am. Also, I'd appreciate an honest opinion even if it may seem a little cruel to you.",1,1770180287.0,IncelExit,4,0.67,False
