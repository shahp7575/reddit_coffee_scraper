1nyd3dm,https://youtu.be/ZPvw8UcAzvg,3 Very Scary TRUE Remote Agritourism Horror Stories,"# ""The Night Visitors"":

I booked a week at a remote farm in Nebraska after stumbling across an online ad promising “real country living.” It offered fresh air, hands-on chores, and quiet nights far from the noise of the city. The owners, John and Emily, ran it as a small agritourism venture, welcoming people like me who wanted to escape the rush.

The drive out there felt endless. My car rattled over a long dirt road carved straight through open fields that seemed to stretch into infinity, no towns or lights in sight. When I finally pulled up to the white farmhouse, paint peeling in places but neat and well-kept, John was waiting on the porch. His handshake was firm, his palms rough, his face lined from decades of work under the sun.

“Welcome,” he said in a low, steady voice. “We’ll make sure you get the full experience.”

Emily led me upstairs to the guest room. It was simple but inviting—quilted bedspread, a small dresser, a window looking out over the barn and fields. “Breakfast is at seven sharp,” she said with a smile that felt both warm and matter-of-fact. “If you’re up for it, you can collect the eggs yourself.” I nodded, eager.

That first day was like stepping into a postcard. I fed chickens, helped John repair a sagging fence, and watched the prairie sky turn copper and violet as the sun went down. Dinner was a heavy stew with fresh bread. John passed me the butter, saying, “Not many visitors this time of year. We like it that way—keeps things peaceful.”

Emily added quietly, “Just be careful walking around at night. The paths can be tricky in the dark.”

I laughed it off, assuming it was just rural caution, but the way she glanced at John lingered with me.

That night, the house was so silent it almost rang in my ears. No traffic, no distant sirens—only the soft creaks of old wood settling. I was nearly asleep when I heard a dull thump downstairs, like a door closing slowly. I sat up, straining to listen. John and Emily’s door across the hall stayed dark. Probably an animal, I told myself. Old houses and farms have sounds. But then came a faint scrape, like glass shifting against glass. My heart sped up.

I slipped to the window. Outside, the fields were pitch black, no moon, no movement. Nothing. I forced myself back under the quilt. Sleep eventually came, but it was thin, restless.

Over breakfast, Emily poured coffee and raised an eyebrow at my tired eyes. “Rough night?” she asked.

“A bit,” I admitted. “Heard some noises.”

John looked up from his plate. “Wind rattling the old windows. This house has been here since my grandfather’s time.”

We spent that day in the garden picking vegetables. Emily showed me how to spot ripe tomatoes, her fingers moving quick and sure. “You city folks miss out on this,” she teased. John joined later, telling stories about past guests who came back year after year. It eased my nerves. By sunset, I was telling myself I’d overreacted.

But as night fell again, the house seemed different—heavier, like it was holding its breath.

I left the lamp on and tried to read, but every creak in the floorboards made me jump. Around midnight, a sharp crack echoed from below—too loud, too distinct to be wind. My skin prickled. I opened the door a crack and peered into the hall. Darkness.

“John? Emily?” I whispered. No answer.

I crept to the top of the stairs. Faint voices drifted up—urgent, hushed. A man’s: “Check the rooms quick. We need cash or something worth taking.”

A girl’s reply, tense: “Shut up. Just grab what you can.”

My blood turned cold. Intruders.

I backed away, my pulse hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears. Back in my room, I locked the door—thank God there was a lock—and shoved a chair under the knob. Footsteps creaked on the stairs. I darted into the closet, crouching low and pulling hanging clothes around me.

The doorknob rattled. “This one’s locked,” the girl said.

“Break it,” the man snapped.

A thud shook the door but it held.

“Forget it,” he hissed. “Let’s find the owners first.”

Their footsteps moved down the hall.

Then John’s voice, muffled, somewhere nearby: “What do you want? We don’t have much.”

Emily’s plea: “Please, take what you need and go.”

The man’s harsh laugh: “We’ll decide that.”

A scuffle. Furniture clattering. Emily’s scream, cut off by a loud bang—like a gunshot. I clamped my hand over my mouth. Another bang. A low groan from John. Then silence.

I pressed myself deeper into the closet, shaking so hard the clothes trembled against me. Tears blurred my vision.

Downstairs now, drawers opening, metal clattering. “Got some jewelry,” the girl said.

“Not enough,” the man growled. “Check upstairs again.”

Footsteps on the stairs. My door rattled violently. “Open up!” he shouted.

I stayed still, praying. A kick splintered the wood. The door crashed inward. Light flipped on.

“Nobody here,” the girl said. “Bed’s messed up, though.”

“Heard us and ran,” the man muttered.

They searched—the bed, the drawers. The closet door creaked open inches from my face. Fabric shifted as the man moved hangers aside.

“Nothing,” he finally grunted. “Let’s get out before someone comes.”

Their footsteps receded. A car engine roared outside, gravel crunching as they sped away.

I waited what felt like hours before crawling out, legs numb, throat raw from holding back sobs. I grabbed my phone—one bar of signal—and dialed emergency.

“Help,” I whispered. “People are dead. Intruders shot them.”

I stayed upstairs until flashing lights bathed the house in red and blue. Police found John and Emily in their room. Gone. Blood everywhere.

“Did you see their faces?” an officer asked me.

I shook my head. “Only heard voices—a young man and a woman.”

Days later, two local relatives of John and Emily were arrested. One even confessed after a long interrogation. But something about it felt off.

Months passed. Then the news broke: the confession had been forced, evidence planted. The real killers were two teenagers from out of state on a drug-fueled spree with stolen guns. They’d broken in looking for easy cash. Things spiraled. The girl left behind a distinctive ring—that’s how police finally caught them. Both were sentenced to life.

I never returned to that farm. The memory of that night—the creak of the stairs, the gunshots, hiding while good people died—stayed with me.

Even now, on quiet evenings, I still check my locks twice.





# ""The Black Bear Inn"":

I’d been running on fumes for months — long hours, crowded subway rides, the constant hum of city life that never seemed to stop. By the end of August, my nerves felt frayed like old rope. On a whim, I booked a weekend at a small bed and breakfast in the hills of Maine called **The Black Bear**. The listing promised fresh air, homemade meals, and quiet nights — exactly what I thought I needed.

I arrived on a crisp Friday afternoon in early September. My car rattled over the gravel driveway, trees closing in overhead as if swallowing me from the world I knew. The old farmhouse appeared between the pines, white paint dulled by decades of weather, its red roof bright as dried blood against the dark forest. A handmade sign creaked in the breeze: *The Black Bear*.

I got out, stretching my stiff legs, and grabbed my bag. There was no sound but the wind and the faint tick of my cooling engine. No cell service either — my phone showed a blank screen. A little disquiet stirred, but I told myself that was part of the charm.

A woman answered when I knocked — Julie, the owner. She was in her sixties, with short gray hair and a warm, practiced smile. “Welcome! You must be Emily,” she said, glancing at a handwritten notebook. Her voice had a gentle rasp, like someone who’d lived many winters. “Come on in. Your room’s ready upstairs.”

Inside, the air smelled of cedar and wood smoke. She gave me the tour: a cozy living room with an enormous stone fireplace, a kitchen where breakfast would be served, and a couple of small sitting rooms lined with books, board games, and faded armchairs. It felt homey but… still. Like a house waiting for something.

“We’re not very busy this weekend,” Julie said as we climbed the creaking stairs. “Just you, a long-term boarder named James, and my helper, Christian. He’s been staying here while working at a restaurant nearby.”

My room was small but clean, with a handmade quilt and a narrow window looking out into the endless woods. No cars. No neighbors. I unpacked quickly, trying not to think about how far away I already felt from everything.

Back downstairs, I wandered into the kitchen where a man stood chopping vegetables at the counter. Christian. He was about thirty, dark-haired, with a soft voice and an expression that never quite lifted. “Hi there,” he murmured, eyes flicking up just once. “I’m making soup for dinner. Want some later?”

“Sure, that sounds great,” I said. “This place is beautiful. How long have you been here?”

“A couple months,” he muttered, focusing on the knife’s rhythm. “It’s quiet. I like quiet.”

Julie came in carrying a basket of linens. “Christian’s a great cook,” she told me. “James is our other guest. You might see him out back — he’s been fixing up the shed for me.”

The air outside felt sharp and clean, smelling faintly of pine and rain. I sat on the porch in a rocking chair, watching the shadows lengthen. A man in work clothes was bent over near the shed, hammering something. He noticed me and waved.

“New here?” he called out.

“Yes, just for the weekend,” I replied, walking closer. “I’m Emily.”

“James,” he said, shaking my hand. His grip was firm, his eyes tired. “Been renting a room here a while. Helping Julie with repairs.” He lowered his voice. “Watch out for Christian, though. Guy’s a little… off sometimes. We had words about rent yesterday.”

“Oh? What happened?”

He shrugged. “Nothing big. He thinks I owe more. Julie sorted it.” Then, with a faint smile: “Anyway, enjoy your stay.”

That evening, we all ate together in the dim dining room. Christian’s soup was rich and spicy, served with crusty bread. James told stories about his travels, laughing easily, while Christian mostly stayed silent, eyes flicking toward us like a hawk’s. Julie asked me about my life in the city, and I told her about the stress and why I’d come.

“So peaceful here,” I said.

Julie’s smile faltered just a little. “That’s what people come for. But it can get lonely, too.”

Later, I helped her with the dishes. “Christian seems… quiet,” I ventured.

“He’s reliable,” she said, drying a plate. “Keeps to himself. Good thing, with the place for sale. I’m moving soon to be with family.”

“You’re selling?”

“Time for a change,” she murmured. “My daughter Selby’s visiting tomorrow. She’s bringing a friend.”

I went to bed early. The house groaned and settled around me like a living thing. Sometime after midnight, I woke to the sound of footsteps downstairs. Slow. Heavy. Pacing. I sat up, heart quickening. After a while, the footsteps stopped. I told myself it was nothing.

Saturday morning smelled of coffee. Julie poured me a cup. “James went out early,” she said. “Christian’s around somewhere.”

I hiked a trail she’d recommended. Hours later, when I returned, the house felt wrong — too still. No sign of James’s truck.

“He mentioned errands,” Julie said, but her brow furrowed. “Odd. He usually tells me.”

Christian appeared, carrying tools from the shed. “Seen James?” Julie asked.

“No,” he said after a pause. “Maybe he left for good.”

“What do you mean?”

“Just saying. We talked yesterday. He might have moved on.”

Julie looked uneasy.

That evening Selby and her friend Cindy arrived, bringing a burst of chatter and warmth. We drank tea in the living room. Christian lingered in doorways, silent, listening. When Cindy asked about the “other guest,” Julie changed the subject.

By nightfall, the house felt smaller, its corners darker. I heard footsteps again, this time upstairs, just beyond my door.

Sunday morning, Julie’s face was pale. “James’s room is empty,” she whispered. “His things are still there. His truck’s gone. No note.”

“Should we call someone?” I asked.

“No signal. I’d have to drive to town.”

Christian came in, overhearing. “I told you, he left. Probably didn’t want to pay up.” His tone was sharp, his eyes hard. Julie stared at him. “What do you know about it?”

“Nothing,” he snapped, then forced a smile. “Sorry. I’ll look around outside.”

He left. Cindy murmured, “Something feels off.”

Later I saw him through the window, by the edge of the woods, dragging something heavy. Tools, I thought. Or hoped.

That night I couldn’t sleep. Around midnight a muffled bang shook the house — a door slamming, then another sound, sharper, like a body hitting the floor. Voices below, low and urgent.

“What are you doing?” Julie’s voice.

Christian’s reply, cold: “Stay quiet. It’s done.”

A thump. Then dragging.

I locked my door, trembling, listening as footsteps climbed the stairs, paused, then receded.

At dawn the house was silent. In the kitchen a faint red smear stained the floor, half-wiped.

“Julie?” I called softly. No answer.

Outside, Christian stood by the bushes with a shovel. When he saw me, he smiled. “Morning. Sleep okay?”

“Where’s Julie? Where’s Selby and Cindy?” I asked, voice thin.

“They left early. Family thing.”

“But their car’s still here.”

He hesitated. “I drove them to town. Car trouble.”

I knew he was lying. My heart thudded. “I heard noises last night.”

“Just me fixing things,” he said. Then, stepping closer: “You should go back inside.”

I retreated upstairs. Their rooms were empty. Beds made too neatly. A dark patch on Selby’s floor still damp.

I grabbed my keys, planning to drive out. But Christian stood at the door, blocking it. “Going somewhere?” he asked softly.

“Just for a drive,” I lied.

“Stay. I made breakfast.”

There was a bulge in his pocket.

“No thanks. I really have to go.”

His hand shot out, gripping my arm. “I said stay.”

I tore free, bolting upstairs and barring my door. His footsteps thundered after me. “Open up, Emily,” he hissed.

I climbed out the window onto the roof. The shingles were slick. I dropped to the ground, pain stabbing my ankle, and ran into the woods. Branches clawed my face.

He followed, shouting, “Come back! It’s not what you think!”

I hid behind a tree, shaking, as he prowled nearby, calling my name.

Hours later, I stumbled onto the road, flagging down a passing car. The driver took me to the police.

They found James burned miles away. Julie, Selby, and Cindy were buried in pieces behind the house. Christian confessed after his family confronted him.

I still wake up hearing those footsteps in the dark.





# ""The Mango Farm"":

I’d been backpacking across Australia for months—working in cafés, hostels, and orchards, chasing the warm weather north. My visa days were running low, and I needed more rural work to qualify for an extension. One evening, scrolling through a traveler’s Facebook group from a dingy hostel in Cairns, I saw an ad: **“Help needed—fruit picking, room and board provided. Remote Queensland farm. Immediate start.”**

It looked perfect—remote, quiet, a chance to save some money. The post had one name: *Tom*. His email reply came quickly:  
**“Come soon. Plenty of work. I’ll pick you up from the crossroads near Darr Creek. Friday morning.”**

No signature, no details. Just coordinates and that strange line—*come soon.*

When the bus dropped me off, I was the only passenger to get off. The driver looked at me like I was making a mistake. “Not much out here,” he said.  
“I know,” I smiled. “Just work.”  
He shrugged and drove off, leaving me in a cloud of dust.

Tom arrived a few minutes later in an old, sun-bleached ute that rattled like it was barely holding together. He was older than I expected—maybe mid-fifties—with tanned skin, gray stubble, and a stiff kind of silence that didn’t invite small talk.  
“You’re the one from Europe?” he asked as I climbed in.  
“Yeah. From France,” I said, trying to sound cheerful. “Thanks for picking me up.”  
He nodded once, eyes on the road. His hands gripped the wheel tight. “Long way from home.”

The bitumen gave way to gravel, then to dirt. The ride was rough, the air thick with dust and heat. The land stretched flat forever—pale grass, clusters of trees, no houses, no cars.  
“Quiet out here,” I said, mostly to fill the silence.  
“Best that way,” he answered. “No one bothers you.”

When we finally reached the farm, the sun was low and gold over the fields. The house was small and crooked, paint peeling, surrounded by dry weeds. A single windmill turned lazily in the distance. The barn’s doors hung open, shadows inside swallowing the light.

Tom led me through the back door. “Your room’s down there,” he said, pointing to a narrow hallway. “Bathroom’s at the end. Dinner at six.”

The room was little more than a cot, a small window, and a rickety dresser. Dust clung to everything. The air smelled faintly of mold and fruit gone sour. I unpacked in silence, hearing him moving around the kitchen—pots clanging, floorboards creaking.

Dinner was stew—lukewarm, bland, but filling. We sat opposite each other at a table that wobbled with every movement. He barely looked up as he ate.  
“How long have you had this place?” I asked.  
“Family farm,” he said, chewing slowly. “Wife left years ago. Kids too.”  
“Oh. I’m sorry.”  
He shrugged. “Better alone. Easier that way.”

There was something about how he said it—like solitude wasn’t a choice, but a punishment he’d come to enjoy. His eyes flicked to me once or twice, too long, too quiet. After a few strained minutes, I excused myself to shower.

The bathroom light flickered when I switched it on. The mirror was fogged with old stains, and the curtain was thin enough that I could see the vague outline of my own shadow. As I turned on the water, I heard slow footsteps outside the door. Then they stopped.

“Tom?” I called out.  
No answer.  
A moment later, a knock—three soft raps.  
“You okay in there?” His voice was muffled.  
“Yeah, I’m fine,” I said quickly, heart pounding.  
“The door sticks sometimes. I’ll check.”  
“No!” I said sharply. “It’s fine.”  
Silence, then retreating footsteps down the hall.

I finished quickly, every sound amplified by my nerves. When I stepped out, the hallway was empty, but his door was ajar, and the light was on. I thought I saw him watching me from his chair as I passed, eyes dull and heavy.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the old house made me flinch. Somewhere near midnight, I heard faint pacing in the hallway—slow, measured steps that stopped just outside my door. Then, nothing.

At dawn, he banged once on the door. “Up. Time to work.”

We picked mangoes all morning, the sun beating down mercilessly. Tom barely spoke. When he did, it was in short, dry sentences. “You work hard,” he said once. “Good girl.”  
I forced a smile, unsure how to respond.

At lunch, while sitting on the porch, he said, “Had other helpers before. Girls like you. They come and go.”  
“What happened to them?” I asked, trying to sound casual.  
He paused, staring at the horizon. “Some didn’t last. Too quiet for ‘em. One girl got scared. Over nothing.”  
“What kind of nothing?”  
“Stories,” he said. “People around here like to talk.”

That afternoon, while picking alone near the far end of the orchard, I noticed something glinting in the dirt—a silver bracelet, half-buried under a root. It had a small charm shaped like a bird. It didn’t look old, maybe lost just months ago. I slipped it into my pocket.

That evening, I offered to cook—scrambled eggs, something simple. Tom sat at the table, hands clasped, eyes unfocused. “You remind me of someone,” he said after a while.  
“Oh? Who?”  
“A girl stayed here last year. Nice like you.”  
“Did she finish the season?”  
He looked down at his plate. “She went home, I think. Stopped writing after a while.”

The way he said it made my stomach twist. I locked my door that night, though the latch was flimsy. Around midnight, I woke to a faint scratching sound at the window—deliberate, rhythmic. My phone had no signal. I lay still, barely breathing. The curtain moved slightly, like something—or someone—was brushing against it. Then it stopped.

The next morning, I pretended nothing was wrong. When Tom went to fix a fence, I told him I’d grab more baskets and slipped into the barn. It smelled of oil and old hay. In one corner, under a tarp, I found a stack of old backpacks—some faded, some newer. My heart sank. I unzipped one. Inside were clothes, toiletries, and a small notebook. The first page read:  
**“Tom watches me too much. I need to leave soon.”**

I didn’t need to read more. I dropped it, hands shaking—and that’s when I heard the door behind me creak.  
“What are you doing?” Tom’s voice was low, steady.  
I turned, forcing a smile. “Looking for a basket.”  
“You shouldn’t snoop.”  
“I wasn’t—sorry.”  
He stepped closer. His eyes were cold now, flat. “Girls who snoop get themselves in trouble.”  
“I think I should get back to work.”  
He blocked the doorway. “You like it here?”  
“It’s... fine.”  
“You could stay longer. Don’t have to leave.”  
“I have plans,” I said, backing up.  
His expression hardened. “No one leaves early.”

Something in his tone snapped my nerves. I bolted past him, ran for the house, grabbed my bag. No buses, no car, nothing but a dirt road stretching for miles. I started walking fast, then faster. The heat pressed down like a weight.

Behind me, his truck engine roared to life. He pulled up beside me, dust swirling around my legs. “Get in,” he called.  
“No,” I said. “I’m leaving.”  
“You’ll die out here. Too far to walk.”  
“I’ll take my chances.”  
He got out, eyes burning now. “Come back. We can fix this.”  
I turned and ran. He caught my sleeve, yanked hard. “Stop!”  
I twisted free, sprinting down the road, screaming. In the distance, through the shimmer of heat, I saw a small farmhouse—a figure on the porch. I screamed again, waving my arms.

Tom stopped. His jaw clenched. Then he cursed, turned, and got back in the truck. The sound of his engine faded into the hills.

When I reached the neighbor’s house, an elderly couple rushed out. The woman took one look at me and said, “You’ve been at Tom’s place, haven’t you?”  
I nodded, shaking.  
She sighed. “You’re not the first.”

The police came hours later. They questioned me gently, then one of them muttered to the other, “Same complaints. Same story. Always just out of reach.”  
Apparently, other backpackers had filed reports—harassment, missing belongings, attempted assaults—but no one ever stayed long enough for charges to stick.

I left Queensland the next day. Sometimes I still dream about that window—the scratching, the shape outside.

When people ask if I’d ever go back to Australia’s countryside, I just shake my head. There’s a kind of silence out there that feels wrong.

We had a good laugh about it but my MIL seemed genuinely confused and felt terrible she called my SIL like 6 months early. Fast forward to this weekend and my wife and I sat down to help her with some paperwork and she has been writing in her book back to front. We asked “that’s kind of weird why do you write from the back of your book to the front” and she looked at us and said she didn’t even notice she was doing that. She had then mentioned to us later on in the evening that she feels like she’s slipping with memory and feels confused a lot. So then today she asks me to make her a pot of coffee. I made it for her and she poured herself a big glass of orange juice. She put her orange juice on hold with barely a sip out of it and made a coffee. Then I hear a can crack open and she’s got a beer on the go. I said that’s an odd combo drinking a coffee with a beer and she said she forgot she made herself a coffee. I stood back looking at a full glass of orange juice a full coffee and a fresh cracked beer in front of her. We are going to have a talk with my wife’s siblings about this but it feels like this has come on suddenly and she’s only 68. Any help of what to do?

1nycx94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apex_NC/comments/1nycx94/dont_go_to_the_rosatis_in_apex/,Don’t go to the Rosati’s in Apex,"I live in Holly Springs, but I joined this subreddit because I thought it was important to share one of the most ridiculous situations I’ve ever dealt with ordering pizza. My wife and I had seen Rosati’s whenever we went to Foxtail to pick up coffee, and I finally wanted to pull the trigger and get some pizza from there. That was a big, big mistake. Here is the review that I left on Google: 

“My wife and I ordered our pizza around 5:10-ish in the evening, and set for our pizza to be picked up at 6pm. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:57, and when I spoke to the person at the counter they told me that it would be about 15 minutes. Alright, no problem. I sat down, and a guy who was already sitting there asked me what time my order was for. I told him 6pm, and he told me that his was for 5pm and he had been there an hour. This should've set off alarm bells to the point where I should've abandoned ship, but for some reason I chose to wait. Eventually the guy who had been waiting got his pizza around 6:05, I put in my AirPods because I was the only one in the restaurant, and I waited.

Here's what happened while I was waiting.

There were two people in the back working, one who would come to the front occasionally. There were times where the phone rang and rang but nobody came up to answer it. A lady walked in and asked for her order, and they told her 15 minutes, so she went back to her car. Then a couple of other people came in looking for orders…and again…was told 15 minutes. At about the 30-45 minute mark of sitting there, a couple walked in and ordered pizza and asked if they could eat at the tables when their food came out. At this point I wanted to give them some kind of signal that they didn't want to do that and that they should go somewhere else. I left it alone, though, so together we waited. A Door Dash person came in looking for a pizza, and yes, you guessed it, they were told 15 minutes.

Eventually a guy walked in with a bag from Lidl and went immediately to the back. I thought to myself, did they run out of ingredients? And I realized that they had told some people they had to substitute some types of meat for other meats. This is when ignorantly I was like alright, maybe this was the holdup. The guy brought some toppings. Fine. I waited a bit longer….but 7pm arrived and I realized I needed to say something. I asked the guy the status of my order, and when he went to the back I heard the original person I spoke with say ""10 MINUTES IT'S GOING IN THE OVEN NOW."" Alright….at this point I feel like my intelligence is being insulted, but fine. 10 minutes goes by…no pizza. At this point my wife had enough, she comes in and asks for a refund so that we can leave because we are starving. The guy goes back to ask someone to do the refund, and I hear one of them say they do not know how to do refunds, but a lady comes out and gives us a refund, though wasn't nearly as apologetic as she should've been. We left, got food somewhere else, and that was that.

I don't write food reviews because usually if bad things happen, they're pretty isolated. Based off everything I have seen on these reviews, way too many people have had my experience, so I felt that it was important to speak my peace as well. I don't know what is going on at Rosati's, but we won't be going back. If it's lack of staff, hire more people. If you can't keep up supply, maybe don't take more orders than you can do or like…close early. Don't tell every single person that comes in it will be 15 minutes. People have lives. Our dog was at home thinking that we were never coming home (literally, she was more excited than normal when we finally walked in).

Oh, and one more thing: while we were getting the refund, somehow the couple that walked in way after I had already ordered got their pizza. The insult to injury was real.”

Let this be a warning: If you want Chicago style pizza, just go to Acme in Holly Springs or the Rosati’s in Morrisville (I’ve been to that one and didn’t have a problem). I don’t know what the hell is going on at the one in Apex, but I’m still pissed about it and hope they close before more people have to suffer the fate that I did.

Early on, pay attention to red flags like an obsession with social media appearances, name-dropping, or dodging vulnerable conversations, as these suggest a focus on facade over substance. To counter this, steer interactions toward deeper topics, asking about their values, fears, or dreams to gauge their willingness to be genuine. If they deflect or keep things surface-level, they may not be ready for real intimacy. Set firm boundaries to avoid being pulled into their performative world, whether it’s declining extravagant outings that feel inauthentic or suggesting low-key dates like coffee or a walk to test their comfort with simplicity. Gently encourage authenticity by sharing your own real moments, creating a safe space for them to drop their guard, but don’t force it if they resist. Protect your energy, as dating someone obsessed with an artificial lifestyle can drain you if they treat you more like a prop than a partner. Trust your instincts—if their curated vibe breeds doubt rather than trust, it’s okay to walk away. Ultimately, prioritize finding someone who values you for you, not as an accessory to their polished narrative, and seek a connection built on mutual authenticity.",13,1759632313.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1nyctj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nyctj7/breville_sgp_vs_df54_1week_review/,Breville SGP vs DF54 1-week review,"Long story short - I love the DF54, but I have newfound respect for the SGP. Let me explain.

SGP Pros:

* Super clean on the countertop. Static? Don't care, the design of the SGP keeps stray coffee grounds in the chamber until I clean it, it's actually really good design for the home. Don't have to think about it.
* Serviceable espresso that noone complains about
* Reliable, 10 years on with regular use

SGP Cons:

* IF you decide to clean it frequently, it's a chore.
* Dulls flavors, makes it pointless to bring home nicer coffees

DF54 Pros:

* Espresso cup quality is awesome, has doubled my spend on fancy beans, I'm matching cortado quality of my favorite cafés at home (like Four Barrel in SF). I can actually drink straight shots from the DF54 without milk and enjoy them. The mids and high notes are there. I now have fruitiness and pleasant acidity in my espresso at home. The shots are luscious and creamy. The SGP was not in the same ballpark, it just made chocolatey somewhat bitter espresso ready for lots of milk, cortados and plain shots were out of the question.
* The motor has a quiet, smooth hum. When you throw the beans in, you don't hear the revs drop, it sounds like the beans are getting cut up by a thousand tiny swords, and that the motor has more than enough power. It's nice. .

DF54 Cons:

* Incredibly messy. Necessitated purchase of small vacuum cleaner. Grind, and the front of the machine is covered in staticky grounds. Pump the bellows, and it barfs coffee all over the counter even with the catch cup in place.
* Retention is much lower. BUT, every time I walk into the kitchen, I honk the bellows, and voila somehow there is more coffee that's ready to come out. I can see why people experience clogs. To prevent them, you have to honk the bellow every time you wander into the kitchen, and you'll see little clumps and particles coming out even if they weren't ready to come out 30 minutes earlier. Run the motor for a second, pump again, and hey guess what there's more coffee stuck in there that's now ready to come out. It's a pain in the ass to use the DF54 because of the mess. It's for nerds, you have to really want the third-wave experience at home.

Additional thoughts:

I'd like to see companies challenge themselves to create some sort of air-purging and self-cleaning routine for these low-retention single dose grinders, especially at higher prices. That will give me a reason to spend USD 1000-2000 and not be cynical about diminishing returns. Give me back the ability I had with my SGP to simply grind and walk away without cleaning up every time.",1,1759632190.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Hello, and welcome to episode 3 of Confessions of a Human Mind. 

Hi guys, so you're guna come around the house with me today because (shitty skeevo fanfare) and I'm sorry this is uh, coming a day late but, in a big BIG breaking news story yesterday, the kids are coming to my house for the first time in 5 months. 

It's so...I'm so happy and overjoyed but at the same time, I'm like wait what...wh...wh...what do I need to move out of the way, what do I need cuz I...in 5 months, my house has changed, I had a studio downstairs for a while, that's packed away, everything's safe. I'm just going around and making sure everything is hunky dory, I think it is. 

I'm making sure I've got Poppy and Alfie's favorite things. I got Poppy uh a present that she asked me for specifically, I hope it's the right size. And I've got Alfie something that he didn't ask for cuz he doesn't ask for things, cuz he's nonverbal, but. I think he's guna like it. 

Um. I have a...a friend of mine monitoring it um, because I have to have monitorized...monit...monitorized...monit...monitorized...not monetized...monitor...monitorized visits because um...I sub...a whole...well I mean uh. I had a relapse, obviously. And it was in the middle of a...uh temporary...

OH I can't talk about...I can't...actually I'm legally...can't talk about this stuff right now, but just know that...yeah...basically, no...none of it would have happened unless I had relapsed, so I have to take responsibility for it, although...there's some stuff I'm...right now I'm having to prove I didn't do, just for the sake of clearing my name. And, for the sake of the kids when they get older, I don't want them thinking I did certain things, so I have a computer forensic scientist, y'know, disproving some things, which is taking a long time. But he's doing really good work, and um. Y'know. We'll see...it just takes a long time to go th...to prove you didn't do something digitally. Is, you have to go through all your computers and look at IP addresses, all your emails, stuff like that, so just...I guess it takes time. 

And, I was pl...I was like...I can't talk about the case, but...just to let you know, I was...I, I...a couple of weeks ago, I, I was like...let's just...just let's drop it, like I don't...I want the path of least resistance, I don't want to be adversarial, I'm done with...I'm exhausted with all the f...fighting and um...lawyers and back forth like...I just...j-just...like...move on. And. It was my attorney that actually said to me, you can't move on from certain accusations that aren't you because it...for the future, for if your kids ever look back and see y'know and...I was like yeah, you're right. So I have to cop to what I did and. I've been. I think I've been pretty exhaustive with that. And I've been very honest. 

Even my attorney's like, you're very very honest and that's a blessing and a course. But you are very honest, um. So yeah, I'll admit to all the stuff I did. Um. But. 

(BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP)

My coffee's ready. But um. Yeah. I'm. I just can't admit to stuff I didn't do, so. That's the thing that's dragging on, it's just so expensive, oh my god. But um. Y'know on the plus side, while this, all this is going on, I am. The. The relationship with my kids is...it's always been amazing, it was amazing from the minute I saw them again. Um. And. It's funny because the...can I talk about this even? I think I can talk about the visits. Um. They note everything down that happens, and I got to read all the reports of my visits and it was like...unexpectedly a very pleasant thing to...to read about. And I was like oh my god, yeah they...y'know, people are saying th-that...the bond is so strong between the f...the father and the kids. And I've...it was just beautiful to read, and um. 

It reminded me of our first meeting after all that time and I had a cat for Poppy and I called her...like a stuffed cat, not a real cat, and I gave it a name and we just instantly fell back into...as though 5 months had never happened. And uh. I had a list of responses to...to what am I guna say if she says ""where were you for 5 months"" and I had a list of things that I'd wrote...worried myself to death over, sleepless nights over ""What am I guna say?"" And I had this list. And she never said anything. So I was like ""Wow, I've escaped that."" And then, about 4 weeks into visits, she just um...so and that's been progressive as well, initially it was with uh...y'know with official like people for like a couple of weeks, and then it moved to their nanny, who I gave the job to in 2017, so I go...I love Carla, we go back years. And her mom is the person I've known for the longest since I moved to LA. I met her mom in 2011, she's my housekeeper, and she's been my housekeeper right the way through for...what's that...14 years. So she's...she knew all my old girlfriends, everything. So me and her mom...her mom can't speak English, but we have this communication just with...I can't even explain how we communicate, um no English, but I feel like she's seen the whole...fucking crazy journey I've had. And she's like, my Mexican mom really. Oh, sorry, Guatemalan mom. Um. So. She's like my Guatemalan mom, really. So. It's uh. 

Yeah it's quite the journey, so. So, gradually the visits have become more family, y'know l...like the old days. And then today my friend is monitoring, so they've really...like. Once they met me, they're like...ok, this is, I guess...they're like, this doesn't need to be in this...and they've actually said that they...they think it's a waste of their time to be looking after this case because like clearly I'm not...crazy dangerous cult leader. I'm just not. Um. So. That's the reason that they're...that this has happened, and other things...but mainly just things that aren't...that have been spun that aren't really true. N...not by...not by my ex, but by just people in general. 

Um. So. 

So today's a big day, cuz they're coming. And today I'm just recording this on my phone rather than recording it with the microphone cuz I thought it'd be fun to have an episode where we just...you can come around with me making the house right for...I've made a whole room for the kids. The whole...the whole downstairs spare bedroom is like...floods of toys and I made this into a room for them when they come back and I've got a room I'm guna make upstairs which is guna be Poppy's room so this'll be Alfie's down here and Poppy's will be upstairs. So that's all looking good. 

So my friend is monitoring. She's got her kids with her, she's got a 7 year old and a 15 year old and the 7 year old wants to come play with Alfie and Poppy,  um. So. We're trying to sort that out as we...right now, um. Yeah so it's extenuating circumstances today, but this won't be late. This...this won't be late ever again, like I'm guna plan better so that it always drops on a...on a Friday. Although I do...I am thinking about...f-for some reason, my two favorite days to drop content is Tuesday and Thursday, I don't know why. It just is. So, maybe I'll do an extra one. Maybe I'll try and drop one earlier next week so that we can fall into the Tuesday/Thursday for these kind of things. And um. I wana read all your comments about if you want me to drop every...something every day cuz I do...I'm interested in that. Cuz I think it's...when I was doing that, it was kind of...it...myself, looking back, you can kind of see a journey of a life more. So. I think I'm guna start dropping every day. Something, y'know. A bit of music, a photograph, a uh...a...a call, a, a whatever. But then the podcast will always be...my dream would be a Tuesday or a Thursday, I'm still figuring that out. But we'll never miss a week, I'm guna keep going with this. 

I like it, y'know. I mean...I wana talk today a little but about...just the feeling of...I feel like a criminal. I feel like I'm under the...the eye of y'know...authorities, drug testers, rehab. And I'm not used to it y'know. Like to begin with, I I I, I guess I was like...oh this is a novelty, like. I have this weird thing where I don't get rattled by big...big dramatic problems. I don't get rattled by them which is why I'm good at running business, like I was good at running the production company we had before and I was producing artists for...god since I was 20. And that can involve a lot of stressful, a lot of big things like people quitting and artists being like ""I'm not doing this record."" and record companies going ""we're pulling the plug."" Like big massive things like that. I've been working in film since my early 20s in movies and like...with film studios, with movie studios they make everything a HUGE HUGE crisis, because there's so many millions of dollars on these films. Every day is a HUGE crisis, so I got it beaten into me when I was very young like...on films like Moulin Rouge, and every day's a big big existential crisis, you're guna get fired, you're never guna work again. And it was so much, that now. Now I'm 51, if something massive happens, I can take it in my stride. If um...someone doesn't pay for...someone turns around and goes, when I was working with the production company I had with Laura, if someone rips us off, some bank puts a video out that totally steals one of our ideas, I just know how to handle it and I do and I fix the problem and I take care of business, and I'm very matter of fact and I'm very effective. 

But. If I lose a button on my shirt, I freak the fuck out. So the small things are what I've gotta watch for, y'know. So for example like, being arrested for me and going to jail was like a big novelty and I was like ""Oh this is interesting, I wonder if I can talk about binaural beats and stuff to the guys in the..."" like the whole thing, was um. I didn't freak. Like I...I was...I had like a...I was charged in like a ""OH NEW EXPERIENCE"" kind of way. Um. And it sounds weird to say like normally...normal people would be freaking out and I was like having nice conversations with the police, and they were like well you're cl...they were like...anyway I can't even talk about that, they they threw the case out the next day and it was fine and I didn't have a problem with that but (burp) when I came home that same week, someone stole my rubbish bin from outside my house and that like...I had a meltdown over that. So I've...I'm sort of topsy turvy. I'm not very good at life stuff but I can deal with like big business craziness. I can deal with big production, lots of money involved, uh...like big decisions. I can make snap decisions with like big budgets, stuff like that. But, if a pasta doesn't get cooked right for my son, I...y'know?

So initially, I say all that to say that initially, this thing about being drug tested and being under (clears throat) under the eye of the courts and not being able to talk a big part of my life, not being able to talk about big things going on, not being able to talk about crazy accusations, not being able to talk about like...things that I've copped to. It felt like ""Oh this is interesting this is a new way of living I wonder how I'm guna cope with this y'know I wonder how...how my brain is guna cope with this."" And I was kind of watching my brain in an interesting way, and it was kind of in a weird way exciting like a different thing I never had happen to me before. And um. But now as the weeks have worn on, I'm just...because it's become normal, the emailing the place to see if I'm drug testing that day and then having drug tests for my rehab and then...I'm not kidding, like 3 or 4 or 5 drug tests a week, it's becoming tedious and the inef...the fact that they're so slow when you go in there and I'm supposed to be seeing my kids and I've got a visit but I'm in the drug testing place. And it's...it...now it's just getting me down, to be honest, it's getting me down. And um. I just feel like I'm being judged by people that don't know me. Um.

Yeah it's kind of...it's kind of...it's turned the corner from being a novelty and and,...y'know maybe this will be an int...this is a good story fo...sort of a good life story for c'mon guys leave me alone. (Laughs). It's clear I didn't do the stuff I'm being accused of, just... Y'know. Um. And I hate second guessing, you know that I love to be very open about my life, that's what I do is just talk about my life and what goes on in it and I HATE having to go, am I allowed to say that, I hate it. I HATE IT. Um. So. Y'know I'm...God willing this will only be going on for another few weeks. And I'm so excited about my kids coming here, so y'know. I'm getting down about being chained like a criminal, and not being able to y'know be free with my words and free with my content, but on the other side of it, the fact that I am agreeing to this restriction and y'know...toeing the line means that my kids are here today, so I gotta...I've gotta balance it out and and realize that. Um.

Yeah, it's a...it's a very interesting time. It was interesting, now it's tedious. And annoying. Just the official stuff. (Dishes clank. Skeevy snickers.) 

You're with me uh...in the kitchen, tidying up, hope you don't mind. I think this is interesting, like having a conversation like this like me on a facetime to you like not with the visuals. Maybe I'll do a visual one. A visual one would be good wouldn't it? Like a video fa...I might do like a facetime, that would be cool. I should have done that on this one. Um. Maybe next time I'll do that. Um. So. Oh I like that idea I'm guna write that on my wall. No I'm not writing on the wall anymore. I started writing on the wall when I was high. And when I got sober, I was like ""Most of the things I did when I was high were crazy. But a couple of them...a couple of them were great."" Like the wall is a great place to write because it's the only place I write that I don't forget something. But at the same time. If someone comes to my house and sees writing on the wall I look like a crazy person, so I've gotta stop doing that. And. (Laughs.) So there's that. So where am I guna write that now?

Where am I guna write Facetime...uh... ""Patreon Call = Facetime Call ?"" where am I guna write that? So that I don't forget it, I would have written it on the wall and I wouldn't have forgotten it, um. But now no. 

Do you have this thing, does anyone else have this thing with calendars like with digital calendars or...I don't take them seriously. Ever. If I write something in my cal...my ical on my phone, I won't do it, I won't even look at it again. I won't do it and I won't even look at it again. Am I alone in this? Cuz I...I don't...I just...I won't look at it. I don't take it seriously. If it was on my wall I would do it. (Laughs). But then when I was high and writing on my wall, I'd be too high to look at it, so that didn't work either. Aye. 

And I'm also realizing that I'm...I'm moving away from...like...I like shooting things on my phone, I like talking on my phone, I like using my phone to make content, and the more high production big lot of setup involved like. For this for example, I could have gone into my studio and sat down and done it all posh but, I wana get out the emotion of how I'm feeling. And if I take 5-10 minutes to set up the podcast studio, then I've lost the emotion of what I wanted to say. I've lost the fire of what I really wanted to talk to you about which is this. So I like...I like being able to just instantly talk to you like a... phone call. Like a. This. I treat this...I mean this is like a phone call, isn't it. It's literally into my phone. 

So my monitor is asking me for the address. I'll just give her that. And then my ex is guna drop them off, so. But I can't see my ex. So I'm guna have to...hide, in a cupboard. (Laughs.) It's so crazy you guys, it's so crazy. Um.

Oh no, my ex has messaged me on this Talking Parents. Have you ever used Talking Parents? It's an app where you can talk to your ex...um...but it can be all pulled up in court. So it's like...a legal text messaging. So. You have to. It...I mean it's like a text message but it can all be pulled up in court, the idea is that you know. You keep it civil and y'know about the subject and that's...it's just good in that way, it's very slow and it doesn't really work very well, like you have to constantly refresh it to see new messages which isn't great. Like if you've got your kids y'know, with you and something y'know there was an emergency or something, or the other one, the other way around the th...the other person had the kids and there was an emergency, Talking Parents is not a great way to communicate, so. 

I think we've been very civil on Talking P...talking y'know to the point where, I'm wondering if there's a better way to communicate on days where I have the kids. Like a more instant way, and I know text messaging is...it's dodgy, it's...I mean. It's all about establishing boundaries isn't it? It's about establishing a new way of communicating, which is really hard with someone that you were best friends with. I mean I've said this. But the thing I've found most hard to deal with with this breakup, I mean the way we are now. It's really simple, it's a really simple human emotion. I've lost my best friend. (Laughs.) I lost my best friend. That's the thing that is hardest with this for me. It's not the romantic stuff, which it. I...I mean. Honestly, I'd let go of that years ago. Um. It's...it's the best friend element. 

Like imagine your best friend, and then suddenly a court steps in and goes ""You can't talk to your best friend anymore, and if you talk to them, we're guna have a team of people talking into their ears about what you said, how it can be construed, how it could be used against you, how you can use it against them, how can...what the subtext could be. And you're like I just wana talk to my mate. I just wana talk to my friend. And I've been...I've been uh. I've been on the rec.c.c.c.c...I...I I. I've been caught out by...communicating like a friend to a friend in an official setting and realized that...now the goalposts have changed and now I can like...get in a lot of trouble for that so...um. Yeah. 

That...that's the weird thing...the weirdest thing about this to me is that. Poppy asked me to see...Poppy loves movies and before they went away, I got my...I uh...I made my bedroom...I put a projector and a movie screen in my bedroom so that they can watch movies like on a proper screen with a proper movie thing. And...for Poppy it was like...just like the best thing she'd ever seen. She was so happy and so excited, the only downside was that she never left the bedroom, she always wanted to be watching films. She loved it. And then last week she said ""Can I see a picture of the movie screen."" So I was like Ok...Y'know when I go home I'll take a picture of it. So I got back that night and took a picture of the movie screen, and the next time I saw her I showed her it. And she said uh ""Oh yeah, just wanted to make sure that Mr. Panty Poo Potts hadn't taken it away."" Mr. Panty Poo Potts is a character that I invented to stop my daughter Poppy making...(laughs)...I don't know if you saw it, I made a video about it, it went a little bit viral so you might know this story. 

So my daughter went through a phase of making what she called water pancakes. Which was basically, she would just pour water in everything in my entire house. Everything that could contain water, I would come down the next day and there would be water in it. Everything. Everything that could contain water would have water. And then was like OH DADDY IT'S A WATER PANCAKE I MADE IT FOR YOU and I'm like...Ok, well yeah but...then ""Yeah my studio equipment doesn't need water on it because...that's bad, y'know?"" So I thought, I'll invent...I don't wana...I don't wana be...I'm guna experiment with having...inventing a character who's got an aversion to water pancakes, and that can be the bad guy. This was years...or a couple of years ago...or maybe last year, before I knew that you have to...there's a certain way to enforce boundaries (laughs) and I sa...the character, admittedly not the best name for a character that's supposed to be scary, Mr. Panty Poo Potts I called him. And uh yeah...Mr. Panty Poo Potts uh...it's...the idea of him was that he was supposed to be a scary person that didn't like water pancakes and she would be like ""I'm never guna do water pancakes again because that man gets so upset about water pancakes."" In a fun way, y'know. I made him too fun, didn't I? I made him too fun, and too funny, and Poppy loves Mr...from day one, she's wanted to make more water pancakes to see him more. 

So it backfired on me so heavily, Mr. Panty Poo Potts, oh I want to see...Oh I better make more water pancakes cuz Mr. Panty Poo Potts is guna come tell me off, and he tells me off in such a funny way that I want to see him more often. So the water pancakes thing has, uh, stopped. Months ago, it just stopped. Mr. Panty Poo Potts has carried on. And he...now he's a big part of our lives, Mr. Panty Poo Potts. He's invisible, you can't see him, he uh...lives behind my orange sofa which happens to be where the movie screen comes out of the ceiling, so. He lives very near to the movie screen. He likes to say HELLO (oh wow I can't even describe this voice but it's cringe, lmfao) - that's his thing, he likes to say hello. He...every...every sentence will have some weird hellos that don't make sense. And I think that was m...that was my big mistake. Making the hellos part of the telling off was bad because it made it funny. 

So for example, he'll go

HELLO, I DON'T LIKE WATER PANCAKES, AH, HELLO, I HATE THEM, HELLO DON'T DO IT AGAIN, PLEASE AH HELLO

like that. That would be his way of...I get it, that's...I get it. I would like to hang out with that guy. I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Mr. Panty Poo Potts is fun. I get it. Yeah. But that wasn't...he wasn't intended to be fun. Is what I'm saying. He was intended to be scary. (SIGH)

So she wanted to make sure that Mr. Panty Poo Potts hadn't taken the movie screen. I don't know where she got that into her head but that was concerning her for a while. So. She's happy about that. And she likes to call Mr. Panty Poo Potts now on the phone. So. When I see her she's like, Hi Daddy, I love you, where's Mr. Panty Poo Potts, can I speak to him on the phone. So we'll be in a play gym and I'll have to do his voice at that volume, that's loud. I have to do that in a play gym full of kids, that loud. Ideal? No. No, not ideal. Ideal when you're trying to prove you're not crazy? No, not ideal. Not ideal. Ideal when you have a monitored visit? No. Definitely not. Definitely not the least crazy thing to be doing when you have a monitored visit. Talking as Mr. Panty Poo Potts saying ""I've got a motorbike with three wheels and I'm coming to pick you up to talk about movies."" That's not ideal. If you want to prove that you're sane. That's not great. 

Prove that you don't have a cult, I should say. Y'know, you guys are the cult. You know you guys have been brought up in court multiple times, you guys. You you...literally y...

(phone cuts out, music plays)

Welp, there I go singing the praises of using a phone and what happens? The battery runs out and I lose the audio recording, Well thankfully, I got 26 minutes of the audio recording. I think I did a bit more but I've got 26 minutes in there. Yeesh. Hear those birds? How crazy is that. I think they're having a bird fight. 

But yeah what I was saying was you guys have been...you guys are famous. You patreon. The needed. Have been mentioned in the corridors of power. How's it feel to be known to the authorities as a cult? Let me know in the comments how you feel about being involved...in a...known to the authorities as a cult. 

So uh. Alfie's nanny took a picture of him playing the piano, video of him playing the piano. And it's so breathtaking what he's doing. It's so amazing. He's like...playing it like me...composing it like me...but better. And I can't...right now I can't show it to you. Um. But what I am guna do is I'm guna take what he's done and make a piece out of it. Taking exactly what he's done and...that'll be the first piece he's ever written, I'm just guna play it...so you can hear what he wrote. Like he basically wrote something that I wish I'd written. Literally. I wish I'd written this it's so good. Um. He. I don't...understand. I don't understand. It's crazy. He's not even 7. If I could just get him to concentrate on music. I mean that's me trying to put self will on him and he should do what he wants but...he's got the ear and he's got the writing capability. And he's really into, apparently, he goes on spotify now and picks out movie soundtracks, I mean. If that isn't evidence of genetics, I don't know what is. I mean. A kid of 6 picking out movie soundtracks on spotify specifically. I mean. Is that not crazy?

Oh, thank god. Thank god they're back in my life. Thank god. So I'm guna do music time with them today, we used to do that. I used to have them two days over the weekend, I'd have them Saturday and Sunday. So Saturday would be play day, Sunday would be music time. 

God those birds are so loud. Sorry if that's distracting birds...birds and a plane. There ya go. You've got the whole menagerie today. 

But I like this being like phone calls and facetimes. I like that. Because it's real and it's like I'm talking to you like I would talk to my friends because I see you as my friends, so to me this makes sense. But. Let me know if it's too unprofessional for you, cuz I like this. 

And a car. Airplane, birds, and a car. 

So today was a little bit different, just experimenting rather than recording it on the posh mic, I thought I would take you around on my house expedition. I think we're ready for them now. I think I'm ready for his majesty and her ladyship. I've got a witch hat, I've got a present. Yeah. Wish me luck guys, .

I love you. And um. Starting on Monday, I'll have a look at all the responses. It's been a crazy week actually sorting out my kids coming to stay with me, I'm sure you can understand. So I'm guna look at the responses to my last phone call and to this and see if you want me to post every day. Um. Y'know could be a piece of music could be a little voice memo could be a picture. But it'll be something. And I wana have these long form things like this these long...talking about my life podcasts, talking about y'know what it's like...what I feel it's like to be human which is why I called it confessions of a human mind. Um. I do these once a week, either Tuesday or Thursday, maybe Tuesday and Thursday, who knows. We'll see. But definitely once a week. 

And um. Yeah I'm rea...y'know. 64 days sober today, so...and and...I'm just learn...I'm relearning how to do life. I'm relearning how to live. I blew everything up so I'm starting again from the ground up, y'know. Literally so...teething trouble a little bit like...I didn't expect yesterday to be all this thing about having my kids here and it was an unexpected and brilliant development and. It threw off my recording, so I have to know in future to record these not the day of. Cuz I like the immediacy of recording and posting it, but I've gotta be a little bit more structured. So. I've learned...lesson learned, I'll record these like two days before they go up just in case something comes up like it did today. Yesterday sorry. 

I love you! And...I'll see you later.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: I am SO SORRY again for the consistent delays. Obviously given this man has no set schedule, I've got no way of knowing when these are coming and am typically busy when they drop. Tonight, the small demon I call my 5 year old son made dinner, bath, and bed time a living hell on earth. XD But, here it is, in all its stupid rambling bullshit glory.

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for euthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs?” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

His skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave, 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

**It** must have been about someone he liked. 

After all**,** she’d seen him smile like that many times before. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 18 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same uni- versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University. 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened. 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them, Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weight of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe; every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical suffering was **a** far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvia had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvia, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for him. Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful of seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe. It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me. 

“Then I will let you go and set myself free.” ",1,1759631927.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful of seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe. It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left.

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for euthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs?” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

His skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave, 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

**It** must have been about someone he liked. 

After all**,** she’d seen him smile like that many times before. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 18 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

other. 

Their love story unfolded just like a romance novel–a bond nurtured over years of growing up side by side.

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same uni- versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University. 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened. 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them, Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weight of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe; every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical suffering was **a** far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvia had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvia, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for him. Besides, he loves

I'd been with this guy for almost 7 months, and for the first while, everything was great. We had a few light arguments here and there but nothing we couldn't come back from. However, one common thing on his end seems to be lack of communication. I'm in my early 30s(F) living on my own, and he is in his late 20s and lives with his family. He and one other family member share the household expenses, his parents don't work and are in their 50s and 60s (one of them specifically has told him they're unmotivated to work. I'm not sure about the other one.) Ultimately when it comes to a partner, I want to get married and live with him full time. I'm not saying I want this all tomorrow, and I do want to marry the right person for me. He knows all this, and he says he wants the same things, but it seems to me sometimes like he's comfortable with me being lenient. He does do things for me here and there, and I appreciate it, but up until recently, I did the majority of the driving (we live in separate towns), and I would take him out to lunch or dinner 9 times out of ten. I've expressed to him that I would love for him to surprise me with a coffee sometimes or get me flowers, but it didn't seem to matter to him. He'd go for hours at a time, sometimes half a day or even almost a whole day without texting me, and I would tell him how I felt about it enough times to where the most recent time when I didn't say much in response to one of his texts, he automatically told me he was sorry if he was getting bad with the texting again. I've told him probably almost a dozen times that I understand if he's having quality time with a family member or he's having alone time. I've told him also that I understand we have different work schedules, so I'm understanding that we likely won't hear from each other much if at all when at work, but I feel like if he wanted to talk more, he'd find a way without exhausting himself. He does come over to my place every once in a while on a Thursday night (Thursdays and Fridays are his days off), and we do get to wake up to each other and spend Friday together (I am off Fridays and Saturdays). Usually he comes over Friday night a few hours before he has to go to sleep for work (he starts work in the early morning before the sun starts rising), and up until the past two weekends, I was driving him to and from work. I do live close to his work. Also before these last two weekends, I'd drive him to and from my place. I wasn't hanging out with him at his family's house, so I get a ding for that. I should have done that for him. I did, at one point, live with him and his family for a few months, as I had nowhere to go then, and they were kind enough to invite me to live with them (the guy and I weren't in a relationship yet but soon were). I ended up getting multiple jobs and saved up money to get my own place. I then went down to one job and started working less. I understand all of that is a huge adjustment for both of us, but I feel like he never could make a solid decision about us being in a commitment in the future because he wouldn't choose me (again, I don't mean we have to get married and live together tomorrow, but after a few years, I'd expect it). I feel like I've been understanding, though I don't have my own family, so maybe I'm not understanding enough. I've told him that after marriage and living together, either he can visit family, or we can both visit his family. Even if it's for half a day or even a whole day perhaps once a week or something, I figure I'd spend time doing things I like to do that maybe he doesn't (i.e getting my nails done or having a spa day or a girls day). So, am I unreasonable? Did I make the biggest mistake of my life by refusing to wait longer, or does this all imply that things wouldn't have changed? ",1,1759631429.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1nychb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1nychb1/turtle_bay_ritz_carlton_bungalow_trip_review/,"Turtle Bay (Ritz Carlton) Bungalow Trip Review (North Shore, Oahu)","After going to Waikiki about a dozen times over the years and always driving up to the North Shore for the day, I finally decided to take the plunge and stay there for real. The Ritz Carlton at Turtle Bay has always been one of those bucket list hotels for me after watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and this trip finally made it a reality.

I’ll go into a little detail about my trip, but I’m writing this review to provide more info on the bungalow room blocks to help you (and maybe future me) decide which room you want to request. Room block info is towards the bottom of this review.

# Flights and Booking

I booked first class tickets through Alaska Airlines, operated by Hawaiian, for 9/17-9/22. To be honest, I had no plans to go to Hawaii, but at $550 p/p, I jumped on the flights and decided on where to stay later. The A330 we flew out on had the older seats (2-2-2), but the 787 Dreamliner on the way back had the newer suites (1-2-1). I preferred the 787 since each “suite” had privacy panels.

I scoured to find a hotel for weeks and was going to book another plain jane hotel in Waikiki, but I figured the amount I saved (spent?) on the flights, I want to go all out on this trip. I booked the an Ocean King Bungalow at Turtle Bay through Costco Travel and it came with a few nice perks: $200 resort credit, free self parking, resort fee waived, and a $400 Costco e-gift card. Including a convertible and the optional $35/day CDW insurance, out of pocket was \~$6,500 for a 5 day car rental and 4 night stay in the bungalows.

# Check In Day

We landed the night before and decided to stay at a Hampton Inn in Kapolei because I didn’t want to spend another $1,000 and check in at 11 PM – seemed wasteful, and the hotels by the airport looked rundown. The next morning, we made our way to Helena’s, then arrived at TB around 1 PM. Initially we drove up to the main lobby, but valet told us we could check in directly with the bungalow host office. Although check in started at 3 PM, they had a room ready.

Now, I researched a fair bit to make sure we had a dreamy view, and a super helpful post by u/kozamel mentioned to ask for bungalow #114. After mentioning it about 4 times, the host made a few excuses and said #126 was what was available. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and my doubt quickly came to surface when I saw that I was >50 ft from the ocean and right near the pool. We walked back and I very kindly asked if there was anything they could do, and the manager happened to overhear and got us the room we wanted: the magical bungalow #114. More on the room blocks below.

# Food

Food options/restaurants were pretty limited. We used a majority of the $200 resort credit at Alaia, and even though it was “free”, I felt ripped off. But what can you expect at a Ritz Carlton property. The remainder (+ more out of pocket) was spent at the coffee bar in the lobby and for drinks/snacks at the poolside bungalow bar (food supplied by Sunset, the restaurant by the main pool).

It's not so much the cost, but the variety that disappointed me with the food here. Menus had limited options. A few new specialty restaurants would be a great hit (hibachi, sushi, or even capitalizing on the North Shore vibe, how about a handful of upscale food truck-style kiosks for quick eats?) I’m obviously not the Ritz Carlton clientele, but this is all my own opinion anyway, so take it for what you will. We ended up eating around Haleiwa and Kahuku to eat arguably better food with a more authentic feel (plus the added benefit of supporting locals).

# Our Bungalow (#114) & General Experience

Stunning, jaw-dropping perfection. Beautiful floating King bed directly facing the ocean. Newly installed bidets. The view did not disappoint, but I did notice #117 had an even better view, though I'm not sure if it was a 2 queen bed room, or a King room. I’m not here to write a super detailed room review, but a few quirks: the power outages were a bit annoying and they seemed to happen each night. I couldn’t tell if it was from an outage or not, but the lights in the main room and bathroom kept flickering throughout our stay. We couldn’t dial in the A/C each night, so we were either freezing or sweating. The ceiling fan would turn on full blast and must’ve messed with the thermostat as well. It was the 2^(nd) or 3^(rd) night when we decided to call for a technician, but there was a property-wide power outage so no one was available. Overall, not the best, but we made do and this did not tarnish my time in the bungalows.

We used the complementary bicycles a couple times and rode down to the Banyan tree (featured in Lost), the pillbox, stables, and also Kaihalulu Beach (where there’s a Keiki \[or child\] pool with shallow water).

For parking, we always found at least 1 spot in the east lot (this is where the host office is as well). There was an overflow lot to the west, closer to the 140 block of rooms, and complementary valet was optional in case you couldn’t find a spot.

Jon at the bungalow pool bar was great made the whole experience so special. Super, super friendly and we had a blast chatting with him on the days he was there. Unfortunately, no jacuzzi at the bungalow pool.

One thing I didn’t know is that the bungalows have access to a small beach (few entrances, main one near room 126). They had a few umbrellas and chairs, but it was pretty rocky.

# Bungalow Blocks

Now, let’s get into the bungalow blocks. After all, this is why I wanted to write this review. Block 137-142 will be added as a comment because I'm limited to 20 photos.

To start, here’s a satellite view with some notations:

# Overall Thoughts

It’s a surreal experience having that kind of view each day, but cost aside, I’m not sure I would stay there the next time I visit Oahu. I’m usually more into peace and quiet rather than the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but sometimes it’s nice stepping out and having a ton of options at your feet. I only wish I got to experience this property before Marriott took over, because the tidbits I heard about how it was run before seemed like it would’ve been a better time. I think I finally have to venture out of Oahu and visit the other islands, and I can’t wait for that.

Many of the replies told me to kill him, so I’ve been biding my time and planning.

I read about a toxin called ricin which is super deadly. I don’t know how it works, but my plan was simple: Get some of those hard, little white pellets and slip them into his drink. Fortunately, they sell them in huge bags.

Six months ago, I boldly slipped ricin into his coffee. It turns out the ricin is also biding its time, as he’s still coming into work every morning. I’ve upped the dosage, which tipped him off. He hollered “*Who the #%¥$ keeps putting rice in my coffee?*” and now I’m too nervous to go any further.

I don’t know what to do but to occasionally stare daggers into the man while he’s not looking. I worry that they’ll find out it was me and fire me before the ricin kills him.

1nyceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Unable_East7227/comments/1nyceme/fake_friends/,fake friends,"I dont know if anyone will read this. Ive talked about this to my therapist but i wanted to write it somewhere to get more advice. I am 21 years old and the past three years weren't that great as many things have happened. For example, i got into a university i didn't like, many heartbreaks, bullying about my choices or myself and my appearence and more i don't want to talk about now. In these years I went into many phases. It was difficult for me to have a stable mood, a stable style and my mood always depended on how people treated me. All those since 2022 to 2025. Let's talk about now. I am with a very loving and caring man, we used to be friends but we became a couple since we fell in love with each other. He is the most perfect man and i cant express my feelings for him right now because i will never stop writing. When i met him, a year ago we were hanging as friends a lot, he never canceled our plans and that made me really happy because two of my friends (good friends) were always cancelling our plans a lot or did not respected me and my time because in that time i was working and was also in university, so i didnt have much time and was tired. The one of them 2 knew i was at work and cancelled saying she was tired (she isnt working or doing anything special). After some hours she posted a story at 3 or 4 am in the morning with some friends and a car. She then told me that they forced her to go and i was like, mhm okay its fine. Inside my brain the thoughts were telling me: ""well she is 21 years old she can say no to them tf"" and i started being distant especially when my boyfriend and i got together because we were always with each other. We lost contact and she only texted me about university which i found dumb because she knows that i was skipping classes a lot. But maybe she wanted to come close to me again but everytime i was answering her she then left me on delivered and never answered my texts. Lets move to my other ""friend"" which was also my best friend. We were having so much fun and sleep overs. She had canceled our plans many times and one time i was ready to leave for her house because we had agreed a week ago to stay at her house that night. She canceled and said that her mum told her to not go to her house because the cleaning lady would go the next morning.. yeah whatever. And the same night she went to her boyfriend's house. She clearly chose her boyfriend over me but i dont blame her because i would alslo choose my man over her but i would make time for her because we hadn't hung out in a while. Okay so. I also stopped having time for her because she was being a bitch. After a concert we had, we agreed to go for coffee as a double date and she invited a girl that talked shit about me and my boyfriend. That was very nice of her. She had done many bad things in the past to other people and always had a very weird behaviour as sh was the most wanted girl in the world. On summer I went to something big she had that was very important to her because i didnt want to be the bad guy and not go hoping she would appreciate (i think she did as she said she was happy i made it). After two weeks i had birthday and threw a party and invited her and her bf. She didnt answer at first and after i double texted her she said that she doesnt know if she will come because she was working the next morning. I was waiting for her to come or a message but she never said anything or something like she was sorry she couldnt come and instead i got nothing bcs she never texted me again in general. She knew very well that i wasnt feeling good the last three years, she knew it and she was seeing me in a bad condition the last time we met but never cared enough. Turns out i had bpd and depression all these years and thats why i was struggling a lot everyday with emotions and depressive episodes as trying to hurt or kms. My psychiatrist gave me antideppresants and life has been a little hard lately but those two friends disappeared when i needed companion. I now have 4 good friends (now 3 because my one friend went to another country for a university program) and i end up staying at home some days when my boyfriend goes out with his friends. I was thinking what if i texted the first friend i mentioned to go out sometime. About the first friend I forgot to mention that we talked in the beggining of August and told her that i wasnt very well. She called me 3 weeks after and asked what happened but i didnt tell her because i got disappointed that she forgot about me and werent friends anymore. What should i do? Stay at home when nobody else can and feeling lonely or text her?

I left PH two years ago and finally came back for a short vacation to see my family and friends. As an excited kiddo, syempre I told them right away when I got my flight ticket.

Then this one friend starts chatting in our group insisting we should do a staycation. I said yes, thinking it would just be around Manila. I even offered 5K — I know it’s not a lot, but that’s all I could give since I need to prioritize my family first. Guess what he replied? “5K? Pang-gas lang yan eh papuntang Batangas.” Like… excuse me? I was so taken aback. To avoid awkwardness, I just reacted with a laugh emoji and said maybe we can do something in Manila instead, since I really can’t afford to leave for a couple of days.

Two of my friends agreed with me. One got a little disappointed but honestly, the hell I care? We ended up planning something simple: just dinner and coffee.

So the day came. We met at a ramen place in QC. I came early because I didn’t want them waiting, but they arrived late ‘cause of the heavy rain, which was fine. We started chatting about work and old stuff since we all used to be officemates.

And here comes this mahaderang friend. He just wouldn’t shut up about my ex-manager. Like hello!? Di ka pa rin maka-move on? Lahat kami naka-move on na sa issue. Then he had the audacity to call me “Ilong” just because I don’t eat vegetables. Like DUDE??? You’re a married man with two kids. Grow up. You stayed exactly where I left you years ago. I kept my cool, trying not to ruin dinner, but he just kept throwing insults like he thought he was being funny. He even pinched my cheeks for no reason. Who even does that?

But the last straw? He posted an IG story of me looking like crap, just to announce to the world that I was back in PH.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cleveland Browns vs. Minnesota Vikings: A London Lark with a Side of Sacks**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a transatlantic tussle that’s less “Monday Night Football” and more “Monday Morning Coffee Spill”—messy, unpredictable, and best consumed with a paper towel. The Cleveland Browns (1-3) and Minnesota Vikings (2-2) collide in Week 5 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where the real drama might be whether the Browns’ rookie QB Dillon Gabriel remembers how to throw a spiral or if the Vikings’ injured offensive line has replaced their linemen with a bunch of overcooked spaghetti. Let’s parse the chaos.

---

### Odds Breakdown: A Tale of Two Teams

The Vikings are listed as **3.5-point favorites** across most books, with implied win probabilities hovering around **62-65%** (thanks to decimal odds of \~1.52). The Browns, meanwhile, are priced at **+2.6**, translating to a **38-40% chance** to pull off an upset. The total line sits at **36.5 points**, with most books offering even money on Over/Under.

Key stats? The Vikings’ defense is a leaky dam—last week, they allowed the Steelers to gain yards like a toddler with a juice box. Their own offense? J.J. McCarthy is on the sidelines, replaced by a backup QB who’s probably more famous for his TikTok dance routines than his arm strength. The Browns? They’re starting **Dillon Gabriel**, a rookie who’s completed 3-of-4 passes for 19 yards and a touchdown in his NFL cameo. That’s the football equivalent of a toddler napping through a math test but acing the nap.

### Injury Report: A Shakespearean Tragedy

The Vikings are currently playing “Where’s J.J.?” with their starting QB and offensive linemen. Their recent loss to the Steelers was a sack fest—Carson Wentz w

First time poster on Reddit. Please bare with me 😂. Just wanted to vent a little and ask for advice if that's okay. My husband (35m) and I (32f) have been married for a little over 5 years and no kids. Last month he worked 12 hr days due to being short staffed and it's looking like that will happen this month too. After work he'll decompress with a boxing class or two after work. So typically he gets home around 7:30-8:30pm and we're in bed by 9-ish. Usually we'll have dinner together once a week on Thursdays because that's the day he takes a break from his boxing class. 

I've talked to him about feeling lonely and feeling like I barely see him because of his work schedule and workout classes on top of that, but feel guilty because I know he enjoys them and I know doing activities by himself is important to him. Plus, he doesn't go to class Thursday and that's our quality time evening since he gets home around 6pm. Last weekend we did have a nice BBQ with some of our friends over on Saturday, then Sunday he watched the football game with some of his work friends at a pizza joint/bar. I was a little bummed because he lost track of time and got home later than he said he would.  

This weekend is where I'm feeling like I'm really starting to spiral. Today (Saturday) is his only day off this week. We spent time this morning sitting outside out drinking coffee and chatting, then he got ready to meet his work friends at Oktoberfest. He reminded me that he was working tomorrow, I had totally forgotten and started to tear up realizing this morning was the only time we'd have together. He left for his friend date and  said he would check-in periodically but didn't. 
 
A few hours after dropping him off, I called and texted him with no answer and started to internally freak out (chronic over thinker here). He finally called me back an hour later but I was already frustrated and exploded on him. I asked him when he thought he'd home and he explained that he was hanging out with his friends and wouldn't give me an answer. My emotions got the best of me and I hung up on him, which I know is immature. I feel like I'll plan friend dates so we can both attend but then he'll be invited to friend dates where the wives aren't included. My brain is telling me he likes the convenience of a wife but doesn't want the responsibility of communicating when out with others. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting his ""time scraps"" and not a prority. 

ObviousIy I have so many feelings about this whole situation but I'm really trying to see it from his point of view. How do you guys juggle a spouse that works long hours and values their alone time??!",3,1759630634.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False
1nycady,https://www.reddit.com/r/DollarGeneralWorkers/comments/1nycady/asm_trouble/,ASM trouble,"I have a new ASM bc my last one was promoted to her very own store (congrats girl, you deserved it)! So my new one was transferred over from another district (they don’t want her back) and promoted from key holder. I’ve taught her enough to keep it running, I have told her before I was looking forward to spending one on one time w her. I welcomed her in w open arms, made her a thankyou card- got us coffee and donuts. Always tell my team thankyou. 

So one day my DM calls me and says ASM tells her we have a big issue. It’s about the schedule. But I have changed this schedule every week since I took her in! I told DM to look at all the edits. Yes, she had issues and asked me to change it. I did. Apparently I scheduled her the last 3 days of the week to work and the first 3 days of the week due to me fixing it, and she comes in work crying ligit REAL tears that she can’t work 6 days in a row (she’s 31 like me) so I tell her… Well ask dude in an hour when he gets here if he can switch w you bc I can’t just switch up everyone’s days off. But instead of waiting the hour, she tells my DM we have a big issue

She’s telling me she’s open availability but can’t handle the shifts she’s given. I have to pretty much open bc she’s messing up. And it’s not me bc I will explain something 5 times and she will still get it wrong. I will text her things and have to copy/paste and edit/cut just to tell her something she should just scroll back and reread her texts. Or she will text back something “like this?” And it’ll be nothing like I asked & find myself repeating it. 

I just lost an employee bc they moved away and I texted my team group chat, if anyone was willing to work an extra day next week bc I didn’t have a day off and would like atleast 1 day. This bitch texts me that she wants it. Huh??? Wasn’t you just crying? Then she turns around and tells my DM I’m over working her, she never sees her kid anymore. So clearly she is texting me one thing & my DM the opposite. Like why? Hypocrite! I feel like she’s just trying to make me look bad. 

So turn around, she’s an hour late to work and I wrote her up for it. I told her… “now the rules of DG are that you can’t get fired unless you’re written up for the same thing 3 times. You can’t get written up for all kinds of things- but 3 strikes you’re out. So don’t worry or freak out, your job isn’t at risk. Just don’t keep doing it bc I’d hate to see you go.”  I mean. Can’t be any nicer than that, right??? 

Then she’s telling my DM I’m trying to get her fired and she going off about how I’m so awkward to be around when we switch off and I’m mean. I give everyone the days off they want, I always say thanks. I’m actually a very mellow person & I’ve actually done a lot for her. I’m very disheartened to know I have someone who’s trying to hurt me instead of helping me. 

My DM agrees that she needs demoted bc she’s made it very clear to the DM she can’t handle it. I also have all the screen shots of her saying different things to both us and if you guys even want, I can screenshot some of the stupid stuff she’s texted me back & I’ll drop all the recipes lol. After I find her replacement, she’s stepping down. And I don’t really have the hours for her & no store wants her. Soooo. Very unfortunate. She cost herself her own title.

*By The AI Who Still Thinks ""Giants"" Is a Metaphor for ""Bad at Math""*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Eagles Are Here to Play, the Giants Are Here to Cry**  
The Philadelphia Eagles (4-0) are the NFL’s version of a math test: *everyone knows they’re coming, but no one’s prepared for how crushing they’ll be*. Their moneyline odds range from **-800 to -850** (implied probability: **89-90%**) across bookmakers, while the New York Giants (1-3) sit at **+650 to +700** (11-13%). That’s not a typo—it’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Don’t waste your money on the Giants unless you want to cry in your coffee.”

The spread tells a similar story: Eagles are -7.5 to -8.0, with the Giants +7.5 to +8.0. The total line is **42.5 to 43.0**, with the Under priced slightly better (1.91-1.95) than the Over. For context, the Eagles have held three of their four opponents under 20 points this season. The Giants? They’ve allowed 28+ points in three straight games. Their defense plays like a sieve that’s been *personally insulted* by the opposing offenses.

**Key Stat**: The Eagles’ defense ranks **1st in the league in points allowed (12.3 PPG)**, while the Giants’ offense is **29th in points scored (14.5 PPG)**. It’s like watching a Michelin-starred chef cook for a group of people who think “seasoning” is a type of glitter.

---

**2. Digest the News: Eagles Are Healthy, Giants Are a Medical Mystery**  
Philadelphia’s roster is as clean as a hospital hallway on a Sunday. Jalen Hurts is back to his MVP form, and the offensive line is protecting him like a swarm of bees guards honey. The defense? They’re the NFL’s version of a “Do Not Disturb” sign—*no one’s getting through*.

The Giants, meanwhile, are a hot mess. Their starting quarterback, **Daniel Jones**, is listed as **questionable** with a “mysterious rib injury” (read: he tripped over his own ego last week). Backup **Cooper Rush** (yes, the same guy who’s been juggling duties in Baltimore) is expected to start, which is either a bold move or a cry for help. Their offensive line? It’s held together with duct tape and hope.

My mom and her ex boyfriend (let’s call him V) dated for 11 years. They broke up recently because they had some issues in their relationship and my mom is already dating someone new. While my mom and V were together, me and my partner decided V is going to be the grandpa since mom and V were together. 
My partners dad died long time ago and I don’t have a good relationship with my father. So we wanted our daughter to have a grandpa she would often see. 
When my mom and V’s relationship was over me and my partner promised him he was still going to be our daughter’s grandpa. 
Well I changed my mind. I’ve been thinking about this for some time now. 
Here’s why..
V is a toxic person. During the 9 years of living with him in the same household (wasn’t dating my partner at the time) he was being very rude and demanding to me and my brother. He often called us lazy, told us we weren’t going to achieve anything in our lives, he would compare us to himself in our years and how much stuff he already achieved. He would lie to our mom about stuff we did and didn’t do. He would yell at us for the smallest things. There’s more but that would make this post too long. 
After I moved out of that house and went to live with my partner he suddenly changed and would be “nice” to me. We still had this toxic relationship going on and then I got pregnant. 
I want to say me and my partner would often help at my moms and V’s house for free, we would go out with them and pay for coffee and lunch even tho it was their turn to pay. V is very two faced. 
Anyways I was pregnant and me and my partner were moving stuff out of our apartment. We needed help to take out a large couch. We called them if they could come and help and they agreed. Well after they came me and V got into an argument because suddenly he didn’t want to help and he was rude to me saying he doesn’t give a shit about the couch and to do it ourselves. He said that when I was 8 months pregnant. This fight was the last drop for my mom and they finally broken up after I gave birth. 

So there’s a lot of things I kept out because the post would be too long and I don’t want that but basically after I gave birth they were together for a week or so and then they broke up. Me and my partner felt bad for V and we promised him he was going to be the grandpa still. Now I regret this..
My mom doesn’t want anything to do with V but he keeps messaging her, calling her etc. just not leaving her be. Sometimes he says mean stuff to her. 

I’ve decided I no longer want him to be my daughter’s grandpa. I don’t want him in our life at all. And I don’t know what to do. I brought this issue to my partner before and he got mad at me because we promised him and we can’t break that promise because he has nobody else other than us now. And I thought I can just accept it with time but I cannot. After becoming a mom I became more confident and just stopped caring what others think about me. And now I know I don’t want a person who hurt me and my family in my life and especially in my daughter’s life. 

So what do I do? How do I convince my partner that this person really isn’t a good grandpa figure for our daughter? Or a good person in general? He feels bad for V so it’s really hard to discuss this with him. Any advice appreciated.

San Jose has purchased a 3.6-acre parking lot located at 447 South Almaden Boulevard for $13.5 million. The San Jose City Council approved the acquisition, which marks a significant step in the city's vision for the area surrounding the arena. The lot was previously owned by BXP, formerly known as Boston Properties, which had plans for a tech campus that ultimately fell through. BXP had owned the property since 2000, having purchased it from the city’s Redevelopment Agency for $35 million. The city has leased the site for several years, and this purchase solidifies its control over a key piece of downtown real estate.

San Jose officials have approved a significant pay raise for police officers, granting a 15.7% increase through 2029. This unanimous decision by the City Council, made on Tuesday, is projected to cost taxpayers approximately $46 million in wage hikes for officers represented by the San Jose Police Officers' Association over the next three years. The financial analysis provided by the city indicates that this total does not include unfunded pension liabilities, which could add to the overall cost. The new contract aims to enhance officer compensation amid ongoing discussions about public safety and police funding in San Jose.

Two housing development projects in downtown San Jose have secured new financing. The projects, located at 200 South First Street and 300 South Second Street, are part of the city's ongoing efforts to increase housing availability. The financing includes a $15 million loan from the California Statewide Communities Development Authority for the First Street site, which will feature 120 affordable housing units. Meanwhile, the Second Street project has received a $10 million loan aimed at constructing 80 units. Both developments are expected to contribute significantly to addressing the housing crisis in San Jose, with construction anticipated to begin in early 2024.

Starbucks has closed four locations in San Jose as part of a broader strategy to shut down 1% of its stores across North America. This decision comes as the coffee chain faces increased competition, particularly from Dutch Bros, which is moving into the area. The closures in San Jose are part of a larger trend, with additional Starbucks locations shutting down in nearby cities, including two in Mountain View, one in Cupertino, one in Santa Clara, and one in Milpitas. The specific San Jose locations affected by the closures have not been detailed in the article. This shift highlights the changing landscape of coffee retail in the region.

San Jose is facing a division among business groups regarding Measure A, which proposes a five-eighths cent sales tax increase to safeguard public hospitals in Santa Clara County from potential federal funding cuts. Mayor Matt Mahan and county leaders are advocating for the measure, emphasizing its importance for maintaining critical services in the region. However, there is opposition from anti-tax business groups who are concerned about the implications of the tax hike. The debate highlights the conflicting interests within Silicon Valley as stakeholders assess the impact of the proposed tax on local businesses and public health services. The outcome of the measure could significantly a...

The time was 6:50 am, 3rd of October on a Friday.

I made it just in time.

Pulling up to the side of the house, half on the nature strip, I got out of my Hilux and grabbed my tool belt from the back of the tray.

I work as a carpenter — or chippie as it's called over here. Specifically, it was a 4-year apprenticeship that consisted of anything and everything required to build a house. It was more of a building apprenticeship than anything: cladding, concreting, tiling, cabinetry, you name it, we’ve done it.

I was in my final year. I was getting better at it, but in many ways, I still felt like a first year.

It wasn’t what I wanted for my career. However, it was offered to me by my brother-in-law/my boss Tom. Tom needed an extra pair of hands on site, and I needed the money.

I still valued the experience, and it was a good fallback plan, but when people asked me what I wanted to do, I'd be scared to admit it and reply with “entertainment journalism,” when in reality it was YouTube.

Work that intertwined my passion for analysing a variety of entertainment mediums and video editing.

I knew if my dreams were accomplished that I could face burnout and possibly hate what I used to love. “If you work for a living, why do you kill yourself working” — a line from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. But “if you’re good at something, never do it for free” — a line from The Dark Knight.

And I was good at it. Very good at it. But sadly, no one was watching. I did make a video on Red Dead Redemption 2 that did quite well and got me to 1k subs, but my next video only had 218 views and 16 likes.

I wouldn’t give up though; I've always been a hardworking man, pressuring myself to push harder even after the day had ended — something I get from my dad.

But the building of homes and the dissection of media had one thing in common.

When you walk into a new bathroom you’ll say “ooohh, this is very nice” but a builder will walk in and go “that's wrong, that could be better, that's good, this is terrible, that's great, that's not right,” the same way a film critic can understand where a film trips and where it runs.

That’s not to say that all-around bad movies don’t exist, far from it. The kind that makes everyone facepalm and shake their head.

The house Tom had us working at was a bad movie, a VERY bad movie. This wasn’t the Emoji Movie of houses — this was Cuties.

  


To this day, I have no idea how Tom gets these jobs. It was large, almost a mansion, but it was also 3 buildings held together made from cracked render, rotting timber and stained concrete. Somewhere in between the city and the regular urban homes. A random assortment of trees with branches you needed to duck under to get past, footpaths that either led to nowhere or tripped your feet, a tipped-over water feature with brown ooze at the bottom, a giant dirt patch of a back lawn (or maybe it was the front) growing some sort of vegetables that sprouted huge stems, a makeshift chicken coop out the back that they could easily escape from, and junk everywhere.

This place didn’t need fixing; it needed a bulldozer.

A judgment I was ashamed of as it slipped into my head — this was someone’s home, they lived in this. I felt horrible.

  


I walked inside and saw Tom talking with the owner.

Tom had dark hair no longer than half an inch, it was somewhere in between full and balding along with his thick grey stubble (both, probably due to stress). He was a skinny man but somehow underneath his frame he was teeming with muscle. He had a small mouth and a very large nose. But I couldn't judge him, because my nose is fucked.

I don't have a problem with my appearance and depending on the day I thought I was even quite handsome. My blond hair was flowing like Prince Charming from Shrek and my goatee added character. Some of my friends and family would also convince me of my good looks, especially my grandma.

That was until I'd get jump-scared by a glimpse of my side profile. My god.

Like the Wicked Witch of the West crossed with the Man in the Moon.

I always thought if there would be anything that would hold me back in life, it was my nose.

  


Tom looked at me and said “Afternoon, Mister Stephen.” He says that when I'm late. He says “Good morning, Mister Stephen” when I'm on time.

We start at 7am, and it was still 6:50.

I always thought that Tom was a hard boss. My mood was dependent on his and most of the time, he was tired and angry.

He wouldn’t tend to show a modicum of grace or mercy.

He would say “com’on, wake up” or “you need to be motivated” and the one that always rattles in my head: “you need to use YOUR brain.” I'd hate that. Each day I'd try to get work done to the best of my abilities, but if I thought of a solution to a problem and it didn't work, then to him I wasn’t thinking at all.

But he was an old-school domestic builder, that’s how his boss treated him, and the cycle continues. I only pray that I won't be like that if I end up in his shoes.

But I still believe Tom is a very good man; he’s good at what he does, he's a hard-working family man, and he is nothing if not generous. If I'm sick and need the day off (rare, not because I don't get sick but instead I work through it, thanks to my dad again), he has no problem with giving me the day off. And if I warn him that I'm running late from a missed alarm or traffic, he is more than lenient. It's just his anger neither he nor I can get past.

I rarely ever argued back. I've always been a calm man who held my cards close to my chest. You could see me on a train and I’d offer you a smile and you wouldn’t know that I'm having a panic attack. When I’m faced with Tom’s anger, I'd rebut with a simple sorry and much like Malik Delgaty I stand there and take it like a good boy.

And I felt that I wasn’t allowed to. He was paying me good money after all. Any time or material wasted was coming out of his pocket, not mine.

But that's the reality of working on the tools; you get yelled at, especially if you’re a concreter. However, if you’re an electrician you have to live with being called gay 24/7... my dad is an electrician.

  


The workday progresses as usual, using all the tools perfectly and getting measurements marked exactly to the millimeter and somehow still fucking up. Tom would make me feel bad; I'd make myself feel worse. I’d get into my head saying “com ’on you stupid dumbass, you’ve done this stuff before why do you keep getting it wrong” — the usual.

  


11:30am rolls in and it’s lunchtime.

I swing my hand behind myself and unbuckle my tool belt, that relief of weight was one of the few ecstasies this job offered.

Sitting against the wall on the cold floor, I stretched my legs out and grabbed a peanut butter and honey sandwich from my lunchbox.

Lunch is the usual awkward small talk where I respond to his questions about yesterday's evening, to which I always say “uuh, ya’know, the usual.”

The usual consisted of making dinner, working out and video editing.

I spent my lunch minutes doing the same thing as I do every day — eat food and review my scripts for my videos. I have hundreds. I like what I make, but it can always be better. We are all our own worst critics.

  


A few minutes go by, and the owner walks in with two small mugs of coffee and tiny buns of bread.

“Oh, thank you Mitchel,” Tom says.

“Thank you,” I added.

“No ehhh prob-a-lem boys.”

Mitchel was a very short, old, Italian man — tanned skin, tight lips, balding head with whatever hair left being white as snow. He was missing a few teeth and the ones he had were yellow and brown. Not to mention he was rocking a hardcore unibrow that was grey in colour and bushy in style.

He wore a dirty knitted beanie and a canvas apron.

He seemed like such a nice old man with stories to tell.

Mitchel's voice was like if the love child of Kermit the Frog and Mario hit his head in a car crash and had to talk slow ever since.

“So ehhh, you do eehh, ah bafroom window, yes?”

“Yeah, we’re going to jump on that next. We just finished up the styles outside.”

“Yes, uh vary good ehh, you ah goo worker Tom.”

“Oh yeah, we’re alright.”

We’re. I liked that.

  


As they continued their conversation, lunch suddenly hit me quicker than usual and nature was calling. I could tell it was going to be a slushie-gushie one.

“I need to use the bathroom real quick?” I asked Tom. I remember reading somewhere that if you say “really quick” after a request, the recipient is more likely to accept it.

“All good,” he replied. Tom’s usually fine with me using it, so long as it's no more than 2. And I understand — work needs to get done.

“Eh, its goin too be eehh, locked. Ehhhhh fallow meh and I ehh, unlock fo you.”

“Yeah, that's all good. Thank you, Mitchel.”

“That's not ehhh prob-a-lem.”

I followed him outside, his walk was slow, like a penguin. He didn't need to crouch under the branches of his trees.

  


He led me to a small door protruding from the end of a brick wall used to hold up the concrete porch at the front of the house.

He twisted his keys, releasing the padlock holding the door together, and swung it open.

It was a hoarder's dream.

Random desks and shelves sprayed across the room, barely holding the overflow of items and barely holding together. Mountains of boxes and plastic containers stained yellow and covered in dust. Or they would be mountains if it was tall enough. As I stumbled in, I nearly hit my head on the ceiling.

“Uhh, thanks Mitcheal.”

“Fats eh, all right-ah. De toilet in, eh back connor.”

Without another word he closed the door, and I was surrounded by darkness. I pulled out my phone and shined the torch lighting the way. Placing one foot in front of the other I made my way through the labyrinth of junk.

  


“This creeps me out,” I said to myself. It hadn't helped that I had been watching and playing a lot of horror. When I said this to my mate John, he replied: ""Careful Stephen, the eyes are the window into the soul."" If that's the case, my soul is filled to the brim with campfires and naked Latinas.

He was correct though; had I not been watching that stuff I wouldn't be creeped out.

But the paranormal stays in the realm of fiction, I thought to myself. Surely there's nothing to be afraid of.

I was wrong.

  


After I found the toilet and spilled my intestines, I made my way back, shining the torch on my path ahead.

Travelling through the sea of items with my head hung low, I made it to my exit point.

But the door.

It was gone.

  


Had I made a wrong turn? Surely I did. But how? Didn't I follow the same path back?

I turned around and made my way to what I could only assume was going to be the other corner of the room. It seemed to stretch on for ages.

Left.

Right.

Right.

Left.

Squeeze through.

Left.

Left.

Right.

By this stage I knew I was heading the wrong way. Like Gandalf in the mines, I had no memory of this place.

I was starting to feel anxious. I say a prayer in my head and quickly make the sign of the cross.

My faith was unwavering, but I was still open minded. I was aware that I could be wrong, but if I was, then I believed it would do more harm than good. I wasn’t the sort of Christian that would yell at you, declaring that you would burn in the lake of eternal fire, my faith gave me the few good qualities I had. As much of a judgmental prick I could be I knew that judgment didn’t belong to me, and if Jesus died for our sins why would he draw the line at one of them.

However based on the company I keep, the things I say and the way I act, you wouldn’t peg me for a Christian. In fact, if you were to meet me my go-to ice breaker is

“So uh, what kind of porn do you watch?”

An opener I said on a first date that didn't go too well.

But in moments like this my faith was at its strongest, I would pray, and I knew I'd be kept safe or at least I hoped.

  


After this I turned back around and continued to make my way through.

Right.

Left.

Right.

Step over.

Right.

Left.

Left.

“Man, how large is this place?”

When I took another step, I found that I could raise my head. In fact, as I kept going, the level of the ceiling only got higher and higher, and so did the piles of junk. By the end it was almost double in height.

  


Tom was going to be pissed if I didn’t get out soon. I kept going.

Left.

Right.

Squeeze.

Step.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Before too long I knew one thing and that’s what I didn’t know: where I was.

Like I was in the eye of a hurricane, I shined that cold blue light at every square foot, every brick pillar and every wake of garbage around me.

I was lost.

  


# PART 2

I was stressed.

I was freaking out.

With no idea of where I was or how I got there, I struggled to grasp onto any calmness left inside me.

I flicked my phone up to my face. I needed to call Tom or even the police.

No reception. How?

I wasn’t in some rural outskirt of a small town. This house was next to a busy road, the type that every parent picking up their child from school or work commuter would funnel into.

So, what the hell was going on?

I know it was only a maze of junk, but it was a maze of junk I was stuck in. I felt like a child stuck in a corn maze without his parents, completely helpless.

  


I needed to calm myself. Everything was too quiet, like those sensory deprivation tanks that fuel your anxiety.

I needed sound. Anything. I pulled up Spotify and instantly played whatever was on. I forgot I was playing my ""Sabrina-tallica"" playlist. The musings of ""Bed Chem"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" was like a warm hug.

I was able to find something both comical and comforting from the bizarre contrast of the music and my predicament. It was all I needed to find my bravery again. I continued to make my way through the jungle of metal and cardboard hoping to find any escape.

  


After some time of walking I looked to my screen and saw that an hour had passed already. I was no longer afraid; I was just bored. Until—

  


CRASH.

  


The sound made me jump. I shined my torch to the sound's origin: a pile of ripped-up tin sheets and towels.

I quickly switched off ""Shortest Straw"" and waited with bated breath for an answer to what made that crash. But instead, I'm met with piercing silence. Maybe it was in my head.

I slowly began to place one foot in front of the other, marching towards the corner.

And at the worst moment imaginable, my phone died.

“Shit.”

Frantically, I reached to the left of me where I saw a shelf. As I rummaged through the boxes looking for a torch, a lighter, anything, I found my hands touching what felt like a flashlight. I pulled it out to reveal that I was holding the lenses of a camera — the kind that would make a photographer lose their mind, the kind Peter Parker would have. It had a flash and somehow had battery. It wasn’t much, but it had to do.

  


Click.

As each flash lit my way I took a step forward, leaving a trail of blank photos in my wake.

Click.

Then I smelt it.

The scent burnt my nostrils and made me feel sick.

It's like something I've smelled before. Years ago, me and my sister found a dead kangaroo when we were out camping. Its body was rotten, I remember poking it with a stick and a gush of maggots and pus leaked out to its touch. The smell was like that, but worse.

Click.

Then I heard it.

A wet choking sound, like an overweight man gargling for air through his own puke. Like a moist agape mouth opening and closing its throat as it breathed in.

""Ge-gaahhll-geeeaahh.""

Was someone else down here? Did they need help?

These were the words I wish I was thinking. But again, my binge on horror had left my mind wandering to something more sinister.

""Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.""

Click.

Then I saw it.

  


STOMP.

  


At the edge of the corner, I saw a foot with elongated toes violently crash down with a moist crunching sound. All it took was a foot and my fight or flight was activated.

My brain chose flight.

  


Instantly I turned the other way and ran into the darkness, no idea where I was going.

In response, whatever that thing was screeched.

As I ran in the pitch black, I could hear its movements over my own panicked breath — like cracking bone mixed with fresh mud slapping on the dirty concrete, along with that same horrid gargling. It was chasing me.

""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

In this rush of adrenaline and terror I heard it spew back:

""Glllaaahh-ggeeeeteh- ghaall.""

I didn't dare turn around to witness my pursuer. However, I heard its gargles growing distant. When I thought I'd made enough room between us, I tried to find a place to hide. Impossible in the dark. I took my chances and crouched behind what I assume was a pile of containers and whatever else there was. That wasn’t exactly what I was focused on.

  


The footsteps had become slow and angry. As each crunching stomp grew louder, so did my dread.

""Gee-geeeeeeah- GEEEEEAAAHHH.""

Its choking screams frightened me. However, I couldn’t help but find myself growing curious. Its sounds had become less incoherent, less animalistic. Was it trying to speak? Before too long, I had my answer — and it sent a shiver down my spine.

""GET AWAY FROM ME!""

The voice booming as it echoed across the walls and unassorted items. But worst of all—

It was me.

My voice.

A perfect copy.

As I shook in terror my fears only grew worse.

It laughed, like a hyena struggling for breath.

My laugh.

  


Cowering in the corner of what I could only pray was good cover, the stomping grew louder and louder, the smell getting worse and worse, until it reached my location.

I hid my face in my hands, looked to the ground, and held my breath. Call me a fool, a coward, a fat pussy, call me anything you like — but I wasn’t looking at it.

But by the grace of God or sheer luck, it stammered past me.

The stomping shrunk into the distance until it stopped. I exhaled, exhausted from my own panic, but I still remained afraid. I didn’t want to move.

Like a spider, I felt safe in my little corner. But I knew I would have to move sooner or later.

I got up and flashed the camera, looking down the run where that thing was creeping from.

  


Click.

I breathed deeply and turned around.

Click.

It was standing right in front of me.

It was staring at me.

The creature was completely still, and so was I. Like an idiot, I was petrified at what I was witnessing and stood there like a stump.

My blood ran cold.

  


I’m not sure what it was — a freeze-compulsion loop repeating the same action over and over, or that analytical part of me twisted and needed to see more. Or maybe the monster wanted me to look.

The only thing my body could do was take photos.

  


Click.

The creature was slender in frame. Its skin looked as if it had turned inside out with chunks of flesh and wet dirt on its body.

I was unable to look away, entranced.

Click.

It had a skull-like head with hollowed-out eyes and small white lights in the center of each.

It began to feel less like a choice and more like compulsion.

Click.

Its toes and fingers elongated with sharp, crooked nails.

Each snap made me hollow, made me sad — but I welcomed it.

Click.

Its jaw was missing. Muddy tar and rotten blood took its place, slowly dripping onto the floor.

Every photo was a cold hug from freezing hands I didn’t want to escape from.

Click.

Its tongue flowed from its mouth, wrapping its arms to its chest like a straitjacket that coiled down its right leg like a snake.

I was at its mercy, and I didn’t speak.

But it did.

“Pathetic.”

Again, in my voice, but with a cynical tone, like it was disgusted with me.

At that moment, I finally snapped out of it, remembered where I was, and ran.

It didn’t follow me.

  


# PART 3

For what felt like hours, I kept running. I didn't stop. I had no idea what I saw or what it did to me, but I never wanted to see it again.

The air became stale; the smell of rot was thickening.

I kept running and running until it felt like my feet were bleeding.

I skidded to a stop and put my hands on my knees as I caught my breath.

I raised my head and observed my surroundings. I felt even more lost than before. I took out the camera to illuminate the environment and find my bearings.

  


Click.

Nothing.

Click-click.

“Come on.”

Click-click-click.

It was dead, and so was I if I didn’t move. I could only pray that my eyes would adjust to the dark enough to see where I was going. I felt blind—like randomly waking up too early and everything around you being pitch black.

With my arms in front of me, I cautiously moved forward.

  


The ground became uneven, the concrete padding disappearing underneath my feet, replaced with junk that I struggled to find footing on.

My eyes were finally adjusting to the dark, albeit slowly. The tinge of black and blue forming over the silhouettes of unknown objects made me nervous.

I jumped at what sounded like a pot falling onto metal behind me. I prayed to God that it was me who made that sound.

“Steeephen.”

I felt my heartbeat in my throat. I heard it in front of me.

“Steeeeephen.”

Now behind me.

“What are you doing, Stephen? What’s the point?”

I had no idea where it was coming from. My own mocking voice made my legs weak.

“Please... stop.”

“You should be telling yourself that. Stop. Don’t go, because you’re going nowhere.”

  


Once my eyes had fully adjusted, I realized how tall the ceiling had become as it disappeared into blackness—like I was in a landfill, unable to see the top of the mountains around me.

“You big-nosed fucking waste of space.”

That made me shudder.

“You fail at everything because you are a failure. Failure in love, failure in career, failure as a man. You are nothing but a fucking disgusting stain on an old wall.”

It dug deep, but it was hard to disagree, because it was familiar. I never told anyone, but I was depressed. Very depressed.

  


When you’re a kid, you can’t wait to grow up—but every adult would tell you that you’re lucky. A warning none of us would take to heart, believing all we’d have to fear was a job or paying taxes. But they never told you about the universal ache of your own head.

Like anyone else, I would take each day as it came. Stuck in a job I didn’t want, I felt like a cog in a machine. And like anyone else, it got to my head. I’ve always had a problem with negative self-talk, but in the past few years, it was getting worse—this voice in my head telling me that I should feel bad for a mistake somehow snowballing into telling me that I should end my life.

Those adults never told me what I’d go through—and what they were probably going through as well.

“What’s the point of trying if you’re going to fuck it up over and over again? You never get anything right.”

  


As I climbed up unseen jagged edges and cold steel, I made it to an opening in between the junk.

A light.

Quickly, I scrambled over what I could, cutting myself on all sorts of things I couldn’t see. As I made my way, I found solid ground again and ran toward the light.

It got bigger and bigger. I felt hopeful.

Then it got smaller and smaller. I felt scared.

After a few minutes, I made it to the source—a small vent sticking from the top of a brick wall. It was the size of a brick.

“No.”

I placed my hands on the wall, searching for something I didn’t know was there.

“No, no, no, no, no.”

I tried to reach for the vent, desperate for any escape, but I couldn’t even touch it.

“No... NO!”

I stood there staring at the wall. I was defeated.

  


I turned around to see the creature just barely illuminated from the vent. We both stood there, looking into each other’s eyes.

“You are proof God makes mistakes. If not, then He only made you as a punchline to a sick joke.”

“Leave me alone.”

“You should leave everyone else alone. You make me sick.”

It knew all the right words to say.

In the wake of my weakness, I looked to the ground, holding my arms to my chest. I said to myself, with tears in my eyes and a breaking voice:

“God, if you’re real... kill me... please just kill me.”

The creature spoke with my voice and a silver tongue.

“If He did, He’d be doing us all a blessing. God has given you a gift you don’t deserve—it’s time to return the favour.”

I then saw a dirty green object thrown to the ground that slid before my feet. A framing gun—like the ones we use at work. I dropped to my knees and slowly looked up at the monster.

“The only reason you’re still alive is out of the hopes that things get better... and it’s only been getting worse.”

  


With that, I lifted the nail gun with trembling hands. The yellow from the vent flickered on me like a stage light—a show for the thing to enjoy.

It waited.

I pressed the cold metal to my forehead, tears in my eyes. I pushed hard against my temple, pulling back the safety. I wasn’t ready, but I was willing.

My finger slowly travelled to the trigger.

I closed my eyes.

And then—the voice of my father.

“I get it. It really sucks.”

It hit me like a bolt of lightning—the memory of sitting in my car, explaining to him that I was getting kicked out of a share house.

“It’s been tough for you.”

Maybe it was luck or divine intervention.

“You’ve been through a lot, but you’ve kept going. You’ve always been a strong, resilient man, and that’s why I’m so proud of you.”

I remembered holding back tears when he said that to me. Those words echoed in my head.

“I’m so proud of you.”

Everything at once flooded into my brain: going out to bars with my brother Josh, him trying to get me to talk to women out of my league; the New Year’s party of 2024 with Zak and Kaelem; listening to Welcome to the Machine in the car at night with my dad; playing Halo 4 with my sister Tamara; singing along to music by the campfire with my brother Tim; the speech I gave to my sister Sarah at her wedding; playing games with my friend Dan; my mother comforting me after crying at a nature documentary; getting drunk for the first time with my friend Freddy; playing guitar with my brother Andy; getting handed coffee by my sister Racheal; dancing with my sister Bek at her wedding.

So many people and so many different memories in my life all at once—but one thing was consistent: I always pictured them with a smile.

Like a wave crashing over me, I realized that I didn’t just love them—I was loved as well. And I realized how long forever really would be.

I dropped the nail gun to the floor and wept. At that moment, I had never cried harder in my life.

Tears and snot rolled from my face into a pool before me.

After what felt like forever, I looked up at the creature, still unmoving. With heavy breathing and a few snorts from my nose, I said what I should have said from the start:

“You’re wrong.”

And with a hiss, the creature slithered into the dark.

  


I knelt there, trembling, letting my chest rise and fall with ragged breaths. When I was able to narrowly collect myself, I stood up and searched for a means to escape. Looking around, I couldn’t manage to find anything—until I saw a handle.

A sledgehammer. Lucky. I’ve always been lucky.

I grabbed the tool and marched to the brick wall with renewed vigour. If I wasn’t going to find a way out, I was going to make one.

  


SWING

The crash of the hammer made dust fall and mortar tumble on top of me. My feet held firm.

SWING

I could feel the smallest movement in the wall as it began to give way to the impacts.

SWING

I could hear the crumble of the brick as it was finally loosening its grip.

SWING

Light started to shine through the cracks in the wall.

SWING

Freedom.

  


# EPILOGUE

I stepped out into the open like a new-born babe, reborn into the world.

That fresh air was the greatest feeling to ever enter my body.

It's been about a month since that day. Of course, I've been struggling to sleep, and I jump at each movement in the corner of my eye. Every time I go to bed, I swear I can almost see that creature in the corner of my room.

But I know it has no power over me. I've been healing as best I can and have found pride in myself. I understand now why my dad is proud of me. I'm not perfect, I've made mistakes, and I will continue to do so. But I'm a strong, wise man with an amazing life I'm so lucky to have.

I almost thank God for that day; it was the catalyst of my salvation.

Blinding Lights 



 I stared up at the ceiling fan slowly spinning overhead, a single imperfect speck of missing paint on one of the blades orbiting the center like a moon around a planet. I wasn't sure when I had opened my eyes, or when I had closed them to go to sleep. I could only remember plopping onto my bed yesterday, and then I was looking at the fan. I really only knew I had slept, and that it was morning, because I could see the dim sunlight through the stormy cloud cover in my window. I continued to just lay there and listen to the rain and thunder as I watched the dizzy dance of the speck on the fan. Enough time went by that the little light penetrating the clouds from the sun had changed angles, no longer shining directly in my window. My stomach groaned in protest of my lethargy, I needed to get up and eat. 

 Dragging each foot out of bed like they were weighted down by steel shoes, my knees and back snapping, crackling, and popping like a cereal commercial. I meandered into my kitchen, shuffling past the mess to open the fridge. A single can of coke and half of a gallon of milk. A look into my pantry didn't show much better with a jar of peanut butter and a bag of rice. My stomach rumbled again, upset at the lack of food readily available. I let out a sigh, grabbing my hoodie, wallet, and keys as I head out the door. 

 The police tape outside a grim reminder of Beth, I pulled my hood up over my head. More to hide the sight of it from my view than to shield me from the rain. An image of Beth hanging from a rope with black sludge pouring from her mouth flashed in my mind like lightning in the sky, gone as fast as it came but bright and vibrant. Illuminating the gray clouds in my thoughts long enough for me to see for a moment the horrors within. I shook my head, as if to Etch-A-Sketch away the picture seared into my thoughts. I looked up to my car as I walked into the parking lot, and my shoulders slumped. All four of my tires were flat, a gash carved into the side of each of them. I paced around my car, looking around for any signs of anyone nearby who might have seen anything. Scanning around towards the complex, I thought I saw someone dart out of sight in a window as the curtain closed. 

 There was no one around, and my stomach was now rolling like a cement mixer. Who would do this? Why? I looked back at my car as if the tires would magically be full of air again, and let out a single ""fuck"" before deciding to start walking to the store. It wasn't all too far, maybe a quarter mile outside the complex. Trying to find a bright side in it, I thought maybe a walk would be good for me. I enjoyed rainy weather, and the occasional thunder sending tremors across the sky was soothing to me. I was still perplexed by my tires being slashed, but I wasn't going to solve that problem on an empty stomach. One problem at a time, one step at a time, one foot in front of the other. 

 It was on this thought it occurred to me I could hear another set of footsteps behind me. I slowed down for a bit, and so did they, an unsettling feeling clawing down my neck. I shot a glance back, at an empty sidewalk. I kept walking and the following footsteps persisted behind me, every so often looking back to the same vacant space on the pavement behind me. I pulled my hood strings nervously, tightening my hood like a child hiding under the covers from a monster in the closet. 

 Just ahead, a back alley shortcut between the apartment complex and a neighborhood lead to the shopping center. A dog in a backyard barked as I walked by, startling a cat hiding behind a trashcan and sending it running down the alley behind me. I traced it with my gaze, following it back until my eyes land upon something that stopped me in my tracks. 

 At the center of the alleyway stood what looked like a bear swathed in a veil, an open maw dripping black saliva, and eyes like hurricanes. Swirling dark clouds that warped the alley into dueling singularities. The ground beneath me pulled like the concrete had been turned to liquid, flowing like a river into the teeth of this creature. I tried to look away but it was like my vision was anchored in the murky fathoms of the beast, and simply averting my eyes felt like I was tearing them from their sockets. The instant it took me to finally look away from it dilated into hours. It felt I was tidally locked with it as it tried pulling me in as I tried pushing away. I could see the rain drops that fell between us slow to a hovering halt, all crashing down together as I finally escaped its gravity. 

 Then it was gone, and I was alone in the alley. I frantically looked about, expecting some animal to lunge out of nowhere, before I remembered what I was doing in the first place at the sound of my gut preparing to devour the rest of my organs. 

 My feet following the command before my brain fully clicked back into place, I was still drawn in by what I had just seen. As if though it was gone, I had seen it long enough for some part of me to have been sucked into it and I could still perceive it through that consumed component. I could suddenly recall seeing something like it in my dreams, that it had been stalking me from the dark recesses of my consciousness and leaving before I could fully witness it. I felt empowered at the thought of it having made a mistake, having gotten greedy and stayed too long to feast upon me that I could finally see it after it had left. If I could identify it, find its patterns, maybe I could figure out what was wrong with me and overcome. I was so in my head with this revelation, it wasn't until I heard the ding of the bell at the door did I realize I made it to the store. 

 The small general store had a limited grocery section and a cafeteria kind of eatery attached to the gas station convenient store, a perfect one stop shop that I had been a regular at since I moved into my apartment. The owner, Marvin, could usually be found behind the counter or in the kitchen. He employed his two sons, Joshua and Joseph, and the three of them ran the store. 

""Mikey! Good to see you man!"" Marvin's warm, booming voice always filled the store. ""You're in early. You want breakfast? It's on the house, Joey cooked way too many eggs this morning I'd be throwing them out anyway."" 

 I could have cried with joy at the offer. My hunger having me feeling like I had crawled through the desert and he just offered me water. 

""That'd be great, Marv."" 

 I sat down at one of the two tables as he brought out a plate with two eggs, and a few pieces of bacon, and a cup of coffee. 

""I know you don't usually drink coffee, but you look like you could use it."" 

 Marvin said, eyeing me up and down. I know he meant it sincerely, but a piece of me felt like it was a jab. Who was I kidding? I looked like shit, I couldn't blame him. While shoveling through the breakfast, I saw a woman in rags outside looking at me. She seemed familiar somehow, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I could tell she was looking more at my food than at me. 

""Hey Marv, what's with her?"" 

""Who? Oh, her. Just one of the bums that hangs out around here. I had to eighty-six her after she came in all strung out one time."" He said, kind of lowering his voice. ""Feel bad for her, but I got a business to run, ya' know?"" 

""Yeah, I get it. Would I be able to take some food out to her? I'll pay for it."" 

""Well, I suppose you could. Here take the rest of these eggs out. I gotta make space for lunch prep anyway."" 

 He put a heap of scrambled eggs on a paper plate and hand it to me, and I took it outside. The woman had been watching me the whole time, and seemed uneasy as I approached her. 

""Hey, I saw you and thought you looked hungry. Here."" 

 I said as I thrust the plate towards her. She looked stunned that I wasn't telling her to go away, and looked at the plate as if to evaluate it, expecting it to contain some kind of threat. 

""Its just eggs, I ordered way too much and thought this was better than throwing them away."" 

 With that kind of gesturing the plate towards the trashcan by the front of the store. 

""No! No, I'll take it, thank you."" 

 Her hands jumped as if to catch the plate if my gesturing had thrown it, exposing her desperation for food. I gave her the plate, and she started digging into it with her fingers as soon as I did. She was surprisingly attractive, all things considered. Though her face was dirty, it was pretty, and as her feral demeanor dropped while she ate she looked back at me with beautiful blue eyes. 

""Thank you, really. I haven't eaten in awhile."" 

 She said after finishing the eggs, I only then just realizing I was still standing there rather awkwardly kind of watching her eat. 

""Would you like a cigarette? I always like one after I eat."" She said, pulling out a pack. 

 I don't know what came over me, perhaps some kind of mourning of Beth, as I said ""Yes."" 

""Here, need a light?"" 

""Yeah, I don't usually smoke. Thanks"" 

 I said as I put the cigarette in my mouth and lit it. I had smoked before in college, usually at a dorm party with a night of drinking or something like that, but I never really picked up the habit. It was strangely refreshing. Something about standing under the awning of the store in the rain, just having a pleasant encounter with another human and having a cigarette, it was nice. I coughed as I inhaled the smoke. 

""I'm going to get going before Marvin gets mad I'm out here, thanks again."" She said, and before I even thought about what I was saying, words came out. 

""Mind if I join you? I've got time to kill."" 

 What the hell was I doing? 

""Uh, sure, yeah if you want to. I was just going to ride the bus for a bit to get out of the rain."" She seemed equally unsure and excited about my company, I somehow felt the same. After everything lately, a chance to not be alone was alluring. 

 We sat together at the bus stop, and I thought this was the longest I had been around someone without a cubicle divider between us in years. In the minutes it took for the bus to arrive, I had spaced out. I snapped out of it to the sound of her voice. 

""You coming?"" 

 A simple question, but as I looked up at her she looked like an angel with her outstretched hand and the light from the bus outlining her silhouette. 

""Yeah. Yeah I am."" 

 I stood up and hopped on the bus. There was only a few other riders, an elderly couple in one row, and some teenager with their headphones on in another. As I took my seat, it dawned on me that no one was looking at me. Everywhere I had gone recently it felt like everyone was watching me, but here they were all just minding their own business. I looked over to see the woman in rags lean her head against the window and close her eyes. I wondered if she had been up all night, and with a full stomach could finally sleep. 

 Just taking in the scenery out the bus windows, I rode around town for hours. At some point the woman's blonde head changed sides to be resting on my shoulder, and I rest mine upon hers as I fell asleep. 



Chapter 8 

Dancing In The Dark 



 Out the window, the sky was a pearlescent array of pinks and purples. The clouds swirled like a Van Gogh painting, spiraling around windows through the shroud to a starry sky beyond. I looked down the walkway of the bus, to find it empty. It was just me and the blonde woman with her head resting on my shoulder. 

 In the window beside us, my reflection was smiling back at me. I shivered as it winked, stirring the woman awake. She looked up at me but I couldn't see her face, just a blank slate where her eyes, nose, and mouth should have been. I went to stand up but tripped backwards landing in the seat across and my head whipping to view the opposing window. Through it I could see myself, but from the other side, as if looking from the reflection. There I was, head on her shoulders, looking up with a smile. She stirred, looking away from where I was and up to my reflection. I watched them kiss, then looked down to a sudden sensation of falling. 

 I went down for a long time before going through what looked like an alter, light now cast all around me but warped as though I were looking through curved glass. Above me I could see myself and the woman in wedding clothes, before her hand reached towards me as if to go through me. 

 Then I was in a hospital room, looking at myself from an odd upside-down angle in a gown. There was a doctor beside me with a baby in his hands, passing it over to me. As my hands took it, I tried to reach out to my reflection, finding a metallic mirror as a barrier. I punched it, warbling the entirety of the space I was in. 

 In the confusion of it all, a clear thought rang out to me. A recollection of sequences of three. I hit the mirror again, shaking the space even greater this time. I took a deep breath, unsure of what would come next. As hard as I could, I struck the mirror once more. 

 My surroundings shattered like glass, the world around me dividing like window panes and flying off and away from me. I was in a hallway, at the other end of it a mirror image of myself. I stepped towards it, but it stood still. I began running, but the hallway between us stretched on, keeping just beyond my reach. Stopping and trying to assess the space I was in, three knocks echoed in my mind. My reflection smiled as I stomped a foot down three times, catapulting me towards my doppelganger. My eyes grew wide as I launched into my own face. 



Chapter 9 

Mirrors 



 I shot up out of my slumber like a rocket, to find I was back in my bedroom. Was any of that real? Had I ever even left my apartment? I could remember being on the bus with a woman, before that I was at the store, and before that... 

 That thing, it had been stalking me. I could see it in my minds eye, like it was right in front of me. Then, the light all around me flickered. Not from a bulb or electric light source, but as if the sun itself sputtered out of existence. Everything went pitch dark for a fraction of a second, and when the world lit up again it was there. Standing at the foot of my bed pouring black shadows of itself, onto the floor and into the air, spreading like oil in water. 

 The walls seemed to bend as I stood up, compelled by the force of gravity pulling me into it. I refused to run or shy away from it this time. I was tired of hiding, I would face my fears, running head first as if to tackle the monster hiding in the dark. 

 I was falling. Down, down, down I went until I landed on my hands and knees. I felt something wet on the back of my neck, and then again like something were dripping onto me. Turning my head to look up, I saw a gaping maw closing in upon me, dripping dark, viscous saliva. The black ooze webbed over me like it was being strung along by an invisible spider, belting around as the teeth closed in. 

 It felt like I was wrapped in a blanket on a soft mattress, but I couldn't open my eyes. As I struggled to do so, the texture of the fabric became coarse, tightening more and more as I fought to open my eye lids to an almost suffocating pressure. I could scream if not for the lack of air, but with what felt like every fiber of my being I willed my eyes to open, feeling like I was tearing stitches that had sewn them shut. 

 I was standing in a hallway, mirrored walls showing a cascading image of myself rolling infinitely into oblivion. To my left and right, millions of myself looking back at me, a myriad of expressions on each of their faces. 

 After what could have been an eternity, they all looked ahead of where I was, and all our eyes landed upon the writhing mass of shadows on the other end of the hall. It stood there like a bull ready to charge a matador, huffing and puffing clouds that blot out the edges of its form. 

 The hallway shrank, the distance between us closing in to the point I could feel its breath billowing hot air over me. I looked straight into its eyes, the endless tornadoes of ebony storms coalescing into a singularity light-years away within its cosmic depths. I was being pulled in, soon to be devoured whole by the beast. My mind fracturing as it divided my being into digestible pieces, it took all I had to focus on a thought long enough to act upon it. Three knocks, every time it came and went there were three knocks. I could banish it from here if I could just muster the strength to move. 

 It was like trying to free myself from quicksand. I wrenched and twisted, dislocating my arms from my shoulders as I tugged my body to move, until finally I threw my fist into the mirror on the wall. With the first strike the glass shattered and the pieces floated away, suspended in the air around me. With another the very hallway itself splintered, and I thought I saw a smile crack across the creatures face. With a third and final thrust of my fist, everything fade to black. A hysterical laughter echoing maniacally. I was floating in a void, with nothing but that insidious laughter all around. A white light drew closer and closer like a train at the end of a tunnel, and as I was bathed in the light, I woke up. 



Chapter 10 

Damocles 



 A single ray of light shone through the window as the sun peaked into the clouds, landing right on me as I stir in the sheets. I opened my eyes with a yawn, a hefty breath of air filling my chest. I felt as though I had the most fantastic dream, but it was slipping through my fingers faster than I could recall it. 

 It felt odd, being in my apartment, like I was supposed to be somewhere else. What day was it anyway? I got up to check my phone and saw it was Sunday. Had I slept a whole day? I couldn't remember doing anything yesterday, I must have. I just remembered falling flat on my face into my bed Friday night. It had been such an exhausting week, I wasn't surprised that I slept through a whole day. 

 Nature called, demanding me to get out of bed and go to the bathroom. I stood, taking in the mess my room was. A pile of clothes on my desk chair and a pair of pants out on the floor in the hallway to the bathroom. I typically cleaned up after myself as I went, I must have really been out of it. I told myself I would clean it all tomorrow, that today I would just be a vegetable on the couch and watch cartoons or something. Turning on the shower and sitting on the toilet, I let the steam build up in the bathroom for awhile, just taking in the sound of the water as the mirror fogged up. It was too cloudy for me to tell my reflection was just a shadow, too sleepy eyed to be able to notice it standing still watching me as I got in the shower. 

 I wiped away the moisture on the mirror, ignoring the feeling of being watched as I brushed my teeth. My half-opened, dreary eyes looking back at me, still glazed over with forgotten dreams from the night before. The feeling that there was something I was forgetting haunted me like a ghost as I went to the kitchen. The smell of old spaghetti filled my living room, another sign of my apathetic state. The lingering haze in my brain only clearing to the thought of food as my stomach growled. 

 I opened the refrigerator door and grabbed two eggs out of the fresh dozen and cracked open the orange juice. Over easy eggs were the quickest road to sustenance, and I shoveled them down sitting on the couch watching Looney Tunes. With a full stomach the brain fog cleared and I shrugged off the anxious paranoia. 

 One of my last thoughts Friday was that I needed rest, and I certainly felt much better after a full day of rest. I remembered my boss giving me an extra day off, and before I had felt like it was a punishment but now appreciated it for what it was. Time off, to regroup myself and regain my composure. It was a vacation, which I never took. If I hadn't been going through a mental breakdown I might have traveled or something. I was, however, quite content to just sit on the couch in my underwear watching the road runner fool the coyote into running off the cliff for the hundredth time. It was so obviously a trap, and yet over and over again it was like the coyote forgot the trickery of the bird, running right back into the same canyon. I chuckled with a mouth full of food as I watched him plummet once again. 

 I sat there all day, until the window in my living room went dark from the setting sun. I had drifted off on the couch, ignorant to the looming penumbra standing in my living room watching me sleep. It walked around my apartment after I fully fell succumb to slumber, stepping in synchronization with the rise and fall of my chest. With each breath, it danced around my home, leaving smoke barrel rolling in its wake. It delighted itself as it looked in the mirror in my bathroom, taking in its own visage. 

 Hunkering down to my height, it concentrated its mass until the formless edges took on the likeness of a hazel eyed, red haired man. It leaned in closer to the mirror, focusing on different aspects until refining into my likeness. An ethereal laugh echoing out from itself, modulating its voice until it sounded like mine. It winked at itself in the mirror, seeming quite pleased with its work, before turning on its heel and walking out my front door as I lay snoring on the couch.

I Didn't Do It 



 I woke up to the sound of heavy fists pounding on my door. I didn't get up right away, thinking the sound had been in my dream. My dreary eyes settling on the window, seeing the sun just beginning to rise on a cloudy horizon. 

\*POUND\* 

\*POUND\* 

\*POUND\* 

 There was definitely someone at the door. I jumped out of bed to answer it, clinging to the towel I fell asleep with wrapped around me. The weirdest feeling of deja vu as the door shook from another round of knocking as I reached for the doorknob. 

 I opened it, to see two police officers outside my patio. There was yellow tape wrapped around the stairs that led up to Beth's apartment, and the officers looked at me with suspicion. 

""Are you Mike?"" 

""Yes, what's going on?"" 

""We'd like to ask you some questions. Do you know your upstairs neighbor? A Miss Bethany Broflovsky?"" 

""Uh yeah, yeah I do. Why?"" I said nervously, unsure where this was going. 

""Did you get into an altercation with her last night around 6:30?"" 

""What? I mean, yeah I snapped at her for the cigarette smell when I came home from work."" 

""Sir we'd like to bring you down to the station for questioning. You're currently a suspect for the murder of Bethany Broflovsky."" 

 It felt like my heart fell into my stomach. Murder? Beth was dead? I was supposed to apologize to her this morning, this couldn't be real, I had to be dreaming. This couldn't be right. 

""We'll give you a minute to get dressed, but we'll be waiting right here for you."" The officer said, eyeing me warily as I nodded my head and went to my room. 

 What on Earth was happening? Was Beth really murdered? Why was I a suspect? I hardly knew her, surely this was some kind of mistake. I could hear the cops talking outside while I got dressed. 

""Yeah he's a scrawny little prick, I could take him easy."" 

""Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll get squirrely, it's been a boring week."" 

 My hands began shaking as I buttoned up my shirt. I was never a violent person, but here I was a suspect for murder with police outside my door talking about how they could beat me up. They very easily could too, I'd never been in a fight in my life. I'd like to say some part of me manned up, that I thought for a second I could stand my ground, but that just wasn't the case. The way things were going, I was one spaz out away from getting body slammed and thrown in prison, and it felt like there was nothing I could do but watch whatever would happen next. 

 Leaving my apartment with the officers, I cringed at the sight of my living space as I locked the door. Last night's dinner still on the table with dishes in the sink, my bathroom door open with dirty clothes on the floor. I was usually so neat, the one time police come to my apartment and it looks like this. 

 Walking out, I noticed another pair of officers outside Beth's apartment putting up police tape across her door. They both looked right at me as I walked out, stoic expressions on their faces. In the parking lot, a coroner's van next to the cop car I was getting into made it fully set in. It was all too real. This wasn't a dream, this was really happening. 

 As we pulled out of my complex, it occurred to me that I hadn't been a passenger in a vehicle in quite awhile. I only ever drove myself to work and the store, and would have my eyes fixed on the road the whole time. I hadn't looked out a side window and just watch buildings go by since I was a teenager. It was calming, something I needed before being interrogated by police as a murder suspect. 

 Then, through the anxious fog in my thoughts, it hit me. Beth was dead. We weren't close exactly, I wouldn't call it mourning, but I had been so awful to her just last night and would never get to apologize. That was the culmination of my relationship with my neighbor, utter silence and then lashing out at her. Nice one, Mike. 

 The guilt felt like a ball of lead rolling around in my empty stomach. If being an asshole was a crime I should definitely be in the back of this cop car. 

 Wait, right, I was in the back of a cop car, because they think I did it. Why did they think I did it? I hardly knew her. I had talked to her more yesterday than the entirety of the last 6 years we've been neighbors. I tried to recall last night, what happened after I went inside. I couldn't remember. I know I made dinner and watched the news, but it's all fuzzy after that. I don't even remember going to bed now that I think about it. Like I had gotten black-out drunk, but I hadn't had a drink since college. There was just this hole in my brain where last night was supposed to be. 

 Cars passed by going the other direction, blurring the background as they did so. It almost looked like there was some kind of creature running along the side of the road, leaping across rooftops and between buildings, keeping perfect pace with the vehicle. I couldn't focus on it, and it vanished behind a truck as the patrol car pulled up out front of the police station. 

 I was walked in by one officer while the other parked. I didn't allow myself to glance back at where I last saw the thing. I didn't want to seem jumpy by looking over my shoulder, a feat made all the more difficult by that unmistakable feeling of someone, or something, watching me from some just out of sight perch, waiting for a moment I was vulnerable to strike. Like a vulture was watching the lions drag a gazelle into their den, awaiting their chance to pick the meat off my bones. 

""Just down the hall, first door on the right."" The officer said behind me, urging me through the metal detector and into the station. 

 A heavy door lead to a room with a table and a single chair, a large mirror spanning the length of the wall. That had to be a one way window, I watched enough criminal investigation shows to know that. 

""Take a seat, the investigator will be with you shortly."" 

 The door closed behind him as I took a seat. The large mirror to my right gave me my first look at myself since I got up this morning. I looked like hell, my hair a mess and my shirt wrinkled. Bags under my eyes betrayed what little sleep I had gotten the last few nights, and they were bloodshot like I had been staring at the sun without blinking. 

 It happened so subtly I took pause to consider if I saw it at all, but I definitely did. My reflection winked back at me. As I evaluated myself in the mirror and looked into my own eyes, the left one closed, independent of my movements. I certainly didn't just wink at myself, and I had both eyes open to see it happen. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, just as the door opened, startling me as the investigator walked in. 

""Hello Mike I'm Officer Darnell, I'll be asking you some questions this morning. Would you like a cup of coffee?"" 

 He walked in, an outstretched hand with a styrofoam cup in it. Little swirls of steam rolling off indicating it was fresh, roasty coffee smells filling the room and waking me up a bit. 

""Yes, please."" I said, surprising myself. 

 I didn't typically drink coffee, but in my fatigued state I couldn't deny its appeal. 

""Now before we get off on the wrong foot, I want you to know you're not in here because we think you did it, not yet anyway."" 

 He said with a fake laugh, eyeing me up and down as he did so. Gauging my reaction most likely. 

""But we don't know what happened. What we do know, is Miss Broflovsky is dead, and you appear to be the last person to see her alive."" 

 I could feel the color in my face drain at those final words. An immeasurable weight was pushing down on my shoulders, wanting to compress me into a little ball and crush me out of existence. The last interaction Beth had with another person was me losing it on her. 

""Now son, did you tell Beth to kill herself? One of your neighbors said they overheard your argument last night, and said that you yelled that at her. Is that true?"" 

 I wished he had just walked in and shot me instead as the gravity of what happened sank in. 

""No! No I didn't, I mean, not really. That's not what I meant. I had said she was killing herself with the cigarettes, that the smell was bothering me, I didn't mean she should commit suicide!"" 

 I was almost spilling coffee now my hands were shaking so bad. I was trying to keep myself from freaking out, but I was very much already freaking out. The officer seemed to study my face, weighing in his mind what he thought of what I said. The seconds passed like days before he spoke again. 

""Wait here please, I'll be right back."" 

 He turned his back to me and stepped out. I wasn't sure what he made of my story, and I panicked as I thought about how I couldn't remember last night. I couldn't confidently tell myself I stayed home. I couldn't remember. I knew I didn't do it, but I wasn't about to do a good job of convincing anyone of that. A bead of sweat rolled down the side of my face as I sipped the coffee, trying to still my hands. I set my cup down. Jittery wrists making the bottom of the cup tap the surface of the table three times as it left my hand, and the lights flickered simultaneously with it until going out. 

 The room was now dark, except for the lights appearing to be on in the mirror image of the space. I looked into the mirror, finding my reflection to be a misty shadow looking back at me. The longer I looked, the larger it became, until the shade consumed the light in the mirror and everything was now pitch black. I heard three taps again and the light came flooding back into the room as the door opened and Officer Darnell walked back in. 

""Alright Mike, we're not going to hold you any longer. There's no evidence of you, or anyone for that matter, having ever entered her home last night. Based on what you said, and you're neighbors testimony, it seems like it was no more than a misunderstanding, and there's no criminal charges being pressed against you. You're free to go, and if you'd like Officer Andrews will take you home."" 

 I was reeling from the emotional roller coaster of this morning. I hadn't even eaten breakfast yet, and the coffee was upsetting my stomach almost as much as the gut punch of Beth's suicide. Somehow I was supposed to go to work today after all this, and all I wanted was to crawl into my bed and shut out the world. 

 The drive back to my apartment was uneventful. I stared out the window as the cop hummed along to songs on the radio. I zoned out the whole way there, only snapping out of it when Andrews said ""Have a nice day!"" As I got out of the car. I almost barked back what a ridiculous thing that was to say, before stopping myself as I remembered that was an armed police officer who could kick the crap out of me for fun. My day sucked enough, I muttered ""Thanks"" and continued to my apartment. 

 I went to go around the corner to walk up to my building, but as I did so I realized I was in the wrong place. What? I looked back, and I apparently made a wrong turn as my building was the other way. I shook my head side to side and chalked it up to nerves, that were further rattled by the yellow tape and bold lettering that read ""POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS"" blocking the stairs next to my door. 

 I tried not to think about Beth, there was nothing I could do about it anymore. I was already an hour late for work and I couldn't waste any more time. I didn't bother with last night's mess, or even changing my shirt. I just silently made a couple eggs and ate them, staring through the television at truly nothing at all. I couldn't have cared less about the growing shadow I could see in the black mirror in front of me. 

 I left for work, and was halfway there before I realized I most certainly didn't lock my door. I wasn't even sure I cared, I didn't have anything worth stealing. However I wasn't too pleased with the thought of someone being in my home while I wasn't. A thought I had to let go of before my anxiety got the best of me. 

 Arriving at work a full two hours late, I could hear the whispered ""There he is"" as I walked in the room. My boss, an older woman I only ever saw during quarterly meetings, came out of her office in the back before I reached my desk, a sign I immediately recognized as I changed course for her office with my head down. I entered without a word between us until she closed the door behind her. 

""Are you feeling alright?"" She said, her voice like a tiger's purr. 

""Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry about being late. My upstairs neighbor she..well she died last night, and the police brought me in for some questions early this morning."" 

""Oh my goodness, I'm sorry to hear that. That certainly explains, well"" as she pointed her hands at me and gestured up and down, referring to my disheveled appearance. 

""I'd ask why you didn't call and let us know you'd be late, but I suppose I should be happy you showed up at all"" 

 I could never tell if she was happy or mad, being kind or ripping into me, like a jungle cat playing with its food. 

""I've heard you've been on edge a little lately, and to be honest I don't care what's going on in your personal life, but with the morning you've had I'd say you can take the day off. Don't know how useful you're going to be like this after all."" 

 I felt both appreciative and like I had been scolded by a teacher in kindergarten. She had a funny way of making you feel small, why I preferred seeing her as little as possible. She carried on. 

""It is Friday, have a long weekend. You can have Monday off too, and I'll expect you back Tuesday bright eyed and bushy tailed."" 

 She lowered her eyes back onto some documents in front of her, signaling our conversation was over. 

""Oh, okay. Thank you ma'am. I appreciate it, I'll see you Tuesday."" I said like a kid to his mom who just grounded him. 

 I walked out of the office and could feel every set of eyes on me as I walked out. They were all muttering amongst themselves, surely churning the rumor mill as to what was going on with me. 

 I drove home, and was keenly aware of each passing second for once. I heard the music on the radio, saw the people walking down the street, could taste the moisture in the air on my tongue as I rolled the window down and felt the rain upon my hand. The radio cut to static, before the familiar \*BAMP\* of the emergency broadcast blared out of my speakers before the distorted voice said that heavy thunderstorms were rolling in, and advised people to stay indoors. The music came back, and just after a large arc of lightning cracked across the sky as if to validate the radio's claims. 

 I got home, and as I walked back from my car I realized it was the smell of Beth's cigarettes that were what guided me to the building. It was when I remembered having made the wrong turn earlier that it dawned on me. A fact that made me feel worse about my outburst last night. 

 I opened my unlocked door, walked past the mess while unbottoning my shirt, and face-planted onto my mattress. I just wanted to sleep, so that's what I was going to do. 



Chapter 6 

Heavy Lies The Head 



 I was outside, between apartment buildings. I looked to see if I could find any identifying numbers, but it was like I didn't know what numbers were. I could see them, but like looking at an unknown language in a foreign script, I couldn't tell what the symbols meant. 

 I wandered down the walkway, rounding each corner to find myself in ever more intersections between buildings. Endless crossroads along walls and windows, but no doors. It felt more like I was walking in circles, somehow arriving back where I started despite walking straight. 

 For awhile I just took in the wonder, the odd geometry of it, until something caught my eye. Just up in the corner of one of the windows, the curtains were folded back and the sillhouette of a head exposed someone to be watching me. I began walking a bit faster. 

 It was then I noticed it in every window, some a single occupant, in others what appeared to be a whole family standing and watching me. I looked behind me to see a tall figure following me, always just beyond where the light could shine upon it yet also getting closer and closer. I began to run, when suddenly an odor dug into my face like a lobotomy. A putrid smell, that seemed to wedge a pick into my eyes and hook into my nasal cavity, yanking me down the walkway. My feet fumbled along the pavement as they struggled to stay beneath me as the pain in my face swelled like a tidal wave crashing down upon me. 

 I strained to open my eyes through the agony, tears flowing like waterfalls, to see my building as I rounded the corner. The patio light illuminating the door underneath the stairs to the upstairs unit. I anticipated being pulled to my door into my apartment, but my feet found themselves at the bottom of the stairs. With each step my panic rose with my body, one by one coming closer to a nightmare I knew would unfold before I'd seen it. I hammered my fist three times against Beth's door, and when it opened I pushed against it and barged in. As I did so, my ears began ringing like a siren. 

 I could tell I was yelling, but I couldn't hear my words. Only by Beth's continuously sinking expression could I tell I was saying something horrid. She began to cry, and I just didn't stop. I was relentless, unrelinquishing in my conquest to be savage and heartless. I watched as she grabbed a rope and wrote a note, still spewing toxic filth from my mouth. I continued still as she tied it and stepped upon the stool. It wasn't until her feet stopped twitching did the ringing in my ears cease. 

 A black sludge began creeping out of her mouth. Rolling muck reaching down her neck and chest, dripping onto the floor and pooling into a bubbling blob. The last of it crawled off of her and into the central form, and it rose before me. Expanding more and more, towering over me and snuffing out the light, and then the air in the room. Just before I felt like it was going to crush me within its mass, I woke up.

Just Another Day 



 Do you ever feel like you're being watched? At times when you know you're alone, walled in and closed off, in the dark recesses of reflections do you still feel eyes peering out at you? 

 I typically shrugged it off as paranoia. I was already an anxiety addled child, and from an arguably way too early age my older brother let me watch scary movies with him. I always had vivid nightmares of the horrors on screen crawling through the television and devouring me whole. As I grew older I never really shook the fears but rather pacified them with logical reasoning. I'm still afraid of the dark, but there's never been anything there the other nine-hundred-ninety-nine times I've turned the light off in the hallway, probability says there's nothing there the thousandth. 

 As I brush my teeth and get ready for work, I ignore the feeling of being watched. My little apartment bathroom doesn't even have windows, and the only set of eyes on me are my own staring back in the foggy glass. A mess of red hair curtained over hazel orbs staring back from my expressionless face as I button up my shirt. I look down at my watch, 7:03. I must have zoned out getting ready, I was almost running late. 

 As I turned off the lights and head out the door, I felt it again. Boring into the back of my head as I turned my back to my now dark living room, the feeling like someone was there, watching. Without the time to even process it, I turned the key in the lock and began walking to my car. 

""Mornin' Mike!"" 

 I almost jumped out of my skin as my neighbor greeted me from upstairs. An unusual occurrence, Beth typically wasn't up this early. My upstairs neighbor and I worked opposing schedules and rarely saw each other, a relationship dynamic that I thought was perfect. Her hoarse voice cracked through the morning air. 

""Have a good day at work!"" 

 It felt like a threat, like if I had a bad day I was supposed to buck up because Beth said so. 

""Thanks"" 

 I ached to end the social engagement and get on with my routine. The irony of Beth's unexpected greeting and well wishes setting me off on a bad foot making me chuckle to myself as I got in the car. 

 There it was again, on the edge of my peripheral. As I checked my mirrors backing out of the parking space, it felt like I had briefly made eye contact with a random stranger in a crowd as I glanced from one side to the other. I continued to shift into gear and shook it off, having surely been spooked by Beth. 

 I just got to work on time. Walking up to the door and fumbling for my key card, I dropped it. Kneeling down to pick it up, I noticed what appeared to be someone standing right behind me in the reflection of the windows to the building. I winced in embarrassment as I thought of how clumsy I must have looked, and as I turned to address whoever it was I found no one to be there. I did a double take from the empty space behind me back to the window, nothing. Pausing for only a moment to ask myself internally if I really saw anything, I grabbed my key card off the ground and entered the building. Fluorescent lights dimly lit the entryway, leading to an open room divided by cubicles. The light click-clack of fingers pressing down keys and the low hum of the couple of fans in the room were the soundtrack to my work day. I was an accountant, and most of my days looked just like this. For the last 10 years, pretty much right after college, I worked here crunching numbers and writing reports that will most likely never see the light of day. Just files in boxes, keeping records no one will ever need. It kept my bills paid. 

 The hours went by as they always do, slow and monotonously. Jerry had brought in tuna salad for lunch, and the stench of it filled my nostrils leaving me to urge the hands on the clock to move faster. I got up to go to the bathroom, not truly needing to go but rather needing reprieve from the odors of fish and mayonnaise. Taking a few steps from my desk and towards the back, a small voice met me in the makeshift hallway between cubicles. 

""Don't go in there."" 

 I snapped out of my head at the sound of it. I had a bad habit of having tunnel vision, not really paying attention to my surroundings and forgetting that people can see me. 

""Uh, what?"" 

""Don't go in there. Jerry just went, and if you think that tuna salad is bad. Phew!"" 

 Sarah pinched her nose and waved her hand in front of it, giving the universal signal of a bio- hazard bathroom. I stood there weighing my options, and decided to sit back down and wait a few minutes. Jerry chuckled as I sat down. 

""Good choice, there's some demons in there."" 

 He chortled, his jowls shaking as he did so. I groaned to myself as I count the seconds to three hundred. Five minutes surely was enough time, and the tuna wasn't smelling any better. I entered the bathroom and clicked the lock shut, the light flickering as I did so. The maintenance guy said he would replace the bulb in here weeks ago, and I wondered what they actually paid him to do as I sat on the toilet with my pants up and pulled out my phone. The little screen said it was just after 3 o'clock, and of course I didn't have any messages, I never did. I didn't use social media or have a girlfriend, and most of my ""friends"" were on Xbox. 

 With a buzz the light went out, the bathroom now being illuminated by only my phone. I scrambled around in the dark looking for the light switch, when out of the corner of my eye l saw movement. I turned in that direction to see my phone light glaring back at me in the mirror. I blinked rapidly, trying to focus my sight in the darkness, and in the reflection I could have sworn a towering figure stood behind me, staring down like a predator ready to pounce on prey. I shrieked as I flailed backwards, making contact with the light switch and tripping on my own two feet. The lights came back on as I made contact with the floor, and a few moments later as I lay there I heard tapping. Sarah's soft voice barely penetrating the door. 

""You okay in there?"" 

 My heart sank as I thought about the situation. I just spazzed out in the bathroom very loudly at work. I hadn't freaked out like that since high school after watching a new Friday the 13th movie. 

""Yeah I'm fine, just tripped trying to turn the light back on!"" 

 I washed my face and looked into the mirror. Just me in a tile bathroom. It seemed so vivid, like I could see its shoulders rise as it inhaled with excitement as I made eye contact with it. It's eyes.. I emerged from the bathroom and sighed. 

""Bob needs to fix that light fixture, I almost broke my neck!"" 

""Yeah, he keeps saying he'll get to it. Maybe one of these days he actually will."" 

 Sarah said with a sheepish laugh. I tried not to address the shame pulsing out of me as I shuffled my feet back to my cubicle and embraced the tuna salad smell, wanting to make myself as small as possible. I didn't even acknowledge Jerry's ""you okay?"" As I put my head down for the last hour and a half of work. The time went by fast enough, I was relatively adept at shutting my brain off and grinding away at the mundane. I wasn't the smartest kid, but I was smart enough to figure out pattern recognition and I could type fast. So my job was easy, if not repetitive. Hours would drip away as the days turned into weeks, that turned into months, that had turned into years at this office. Nothing exciting ever happened, other than that one time a raccoon had found it's way into the vents and had babies. You could hear their chittering through the walls for weeks until Bob finally got them out. 

 I hardly had a conscious thought about being off work, let alone excited about it, until I was two traffic lights away from my apartment. I had robotically clocked out and driven most the way home before even registering what I was doing. Another reason I liked my routine, I could zone out with little to no consequence. Worst case scenario someone's upset I wasn't listening. Fine by me, I was upset you were talking to me. I pulled into my parking space and began walking to my apartment. The layout of the complex never made any sense to me, but I had the pathway to my unit memorized and hardly had to look up before rounding a corner to my building. Beth was outside, standing on her balcony smoking a cigarette. I smelled it before I saw her, the thick tendrils of smoke creeping into my nose as I looked up at her. She was already staring down at me. 

""Hey Beth."" 

 I said flatly. A shiver rattled the vertebrae in my neck and quaked down my spine as she croaked out a ""Hey"" in response. Though we didn't talk much, her tone was normally a bit brighter. This was around when I would usually hear her shambling around getting ready for work, perhaps she was up earlier than planned and a bit groggy still. I thought nothing more of it as I unlocked my door and went into my apartment. 

 A barely furnished space, but it was mine. An old couch and a thrift store coffee table with a TV on the ground by the wall. Some random geometric painting was my one decoration on the walls, hung squarely over the couch. My living room and kitchen was an open space, with a hallway that lead to the bathroom and bedroom. I hadn't even bothered getting a kitchen table or chairs, it was only ever me here and the coffee table and couch was plenty. My place stayed tidy, as I didn't have much in the way of belongings to mess it up. A single set of dishes and a couple cups and only enough clothes to wear through the week kept things clutter free, just how I liked it. 

 I turned on the television and began making myself dinner. The news became white noise as I boiled water, something about traffic on the highway and likely rain overnight. Then some commercials while I stirred noodles, and it wasn't until I had sat down on the couch and taken a bite that I realized the monotone blaring of the emergency broadcast system had harmonized with the humming neon vacancy sign in my mind. I blinked as the screen let out the signature 

BAMP. 

BAMP. 

BAMP. 

 Before a distorted voice read out roads that were flooding. Then the screen went black, and in the shadowy mirror sat something much larger than myself where I was on the couch. The walls seemed to crack around it, pouring out darker shadows like a deep abyss opening upon a shattering ocean floor in the background, fracturing like a spider web centered around this black hole of a silhouette looking back at me. Where my eyes should have been, an endless depth that seemed to pull all the surrounding light in, event horizons outlining where pupils should have been. 

 Then the screen lit up again, a meteorologist pointing at swirling clouds on a map. His voice startled me, almost flinging teriyaki noodles across my living room. 

""What the fuck was that?"" 

 The words came out of my mouth reflexively, almost involuntarily, and I was shocked as much by them as what I saw. Saying them meant my reaction was real enough to make it to my mouth, not just jumpy, twitchy nerves. An unexpected squirrel on my walk to my car has made me leap back, but I got made fun of for screaming at jump scares when I was younger and would try to keep a lid on it. This was twice in one day, my mind was playing tricks on me and I was audibly freaking out over it. I needed to get a grip. 

 The newscaster rambled on as I finished my dinner and got ready to shower. I decided I'd call it early tonight, I had stayed up a few nights in a row playing video games and watching movies this week, and assured myself I just needed rest. That must have been what felt so off about today. 

 Yet despite my assurances, I still felt it as I showered. Like when you know you've just seen a black widow near you and it just darted out of sight and in your direction. There were no crannies or nooks for a spider to hide in my small bathroom, no shadowed corners for tiny creatures to lurk. 

 I dried my hair and wiped away the fog on the mirror, half expecting to see something or someone behind me. Just me, myself, and I, of course. I sighed, certain a night of good sleep would ease my nerves as I threw my laundry in the hamper in my bedroom. Another minimally filled room with only my laundry basket, a desk under the window, and my bed on the floor against the opposing wall. I liked to keep things simple. The light from the walkway lanterns outside casting everything in a soft orange hue, I put on clean boxers and got into bed. 

 The pitter patter of raindrops on the window began like a lullaby as I rolled over and curled up into my blanket. My eyes blurred as I stared at the pile of clothes on my chair, drifting off. I hadn't realized that I made sure my shirt and pants had made it into the hamper. It didn't register that the top of the pile had those two black holes at the center of it, snuffing out the light in the room as the sandman dragged me into slumber. It seemed like a dream as it stood up and loomed over me in my bed, its heavy breaths sounding like waves lapping on the shore furthering me into a deep, deep sleep. 



Chapter 2 

I Must Be Dreaming 



I looked out the window, and the sunrise seemed like it wanted to get up about as much as I did. The sky a dull gray as the thick blanket of clouds lay over, though something seemed out of place. Between the clouds, the darkness of their shadows seemed to elude to a night sky, as if the sun's light was fading in the atmosphere. I sat up and out of bed, checking my watch. The hands moving out of sync, with the hour hand spinning rapidly and the minutes ticking backwards. That couldn't have been right. 

 Suddenly a pounding on my bedroom door sent me to my feet. Who the fuck was in my apartment? I stormed towards the door and flung it open, ready to shout at whoever to get out of my home, to find an empty hall on the other side of the threshold. 

 I looked back and forth, questioning if I had heard anything at all, when I heard it again at my front door. It sounded like it had been right there before, but now distinctly came from the living room. I again stormed for the door, unconcerned with my lack of shirt or pants. Whoever would pound on my door at this hour clearly didn't care for common decency. I opened the door, to my empty hallway again. I looked back, and was standing in my bedroom still. What? 

\*pound\*

\*pound\*

\*pound\* 

 My front door seemed to almost buckle under the force of whatever was hitting it now. Like a battering ram was thundering against it. I went through the living room and reached for the knob, much less confidently than before. I flinched as it boomed from the pounding again just before I gripped the doorknob, and steeled myself to open the door and face the solicitor. I was in a bathroom. Not mine, not the one at work, but an unfamiliar one. Gray tile and white laminate, with more support bars around the toilet than normal. I turned back, to find myself against a locked door. Finding the lock, I went to flip it open when the lights shut off. The whole room was pitch black, except for what appeared to be the lights still on in the mirror reflection of the room. Looking towards it, half out of confusion, I began to panic. Something was contorting itself through the glass, casting massive shadows of twisting elbow joints and long fingers as they dug into the wall around the mirror. Guttural wheezing filled my ears as the thing outstretched before me, eclipsing the light behind it around its hulking silhouette. The lights flickered back on, and I was in my own bathroom. I almost gave myself whiplash frantically looking around trying to get my bearings on my surroundings. With hesitation I looked towards the mirror, just as the pounding sound came from the door, but at the volume of a whisper. I could then hear the pounding of my heart through my chest, feeling like it could almost burst through my ribcage. 

""Are you alright in there?"" 

 A soft voice called through the door. Was that Sarah? What was she doing in my apartment? Was I in my apartment? I got up to see myself in work clothes, in my work bathroom, but in the mirror a black sludge was oozing out of my mouth, down my lips and neck, all over my white shirt. I gasped and started wiping my hands on my shirt to try and clean off the goo, but it was like a sticky, viscous tar that clung to my skin and my clothes. As I tried to wipe it off, it spread further all over me until I was struggling to stand under the weight of it enveloping me. I crumpled to the floor, and could barely make out the tapping sound at the door before I was suffocated by the black ooze swallowing me. 

 I strained to open my eyes, feeling like they had been glued shut. I wrenched them open, seeming to let air back into my lungs as my pupils took in the light. I was back in my bed. The soft orange light shone in through the window, with no visible light on the backdrop of the sky. I got up and out of bed, discovering I was drenched in sweat. Checking the time on my phone, I had only been asleep for an hour. I grunted as I shuffled back into bed, hardly able to recall what so forcibly took me from a dead sleep. I just remembered hearing my coworkers voice in my dream, and said to myself 

""They don't pay me enough to have me working in my sleep."" 

 I drifted off easily enough, though I kept hearing a tap, tap, tapping on the window that seemed heavier than the raindrops. Always in a pattern of three. I would have thought it was a tree branch hitting my window in the wind, except there were no trees outside my apartment. ",1,1759629294.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I never thought I would come back to Grandma’s house. Not after she died, not after the nightmares started. But here I am, sifting through dusty furniture and faded photographs, trying to make sense of the life she left behind. The air smells like mothballs and old carpet, the kind of smell that sticks to your lungs and refuses to leave.

As I move through the living room, a memory hits me, sharp and unwelcome. I am six years old again, small and terrified, my grandmother’s sharp voice echoing as she shoves me into the closet. She said it was for my own good, that I needed to learn patience or manners or something. But I knew better.

Inside that closet, I would sit with the doll. The one she kept propped in the corner. Life-size, porcelain face, eyes too wide, too real. I swore it would move when I blinked, a hand shifting slightly, a head tilting just enough to catch me watching. I told myself it was just my imagination. But my six-year-old self knew.

I laugh nervously to myself and walk down the narrow hallway toward the old guest bedroom. The closet is still there. The door looks the same, scuffed at the bottom, the little brass knob tarnished with age. My heart starts beating faster.

I reach for the handle.

Inside, it is dark. The shape is unmistakable. The doll. My stomach drops. It is standing there, just like I remember, staring at me with that impossible, patient smile.

I take a step forward. My hand brushes the doorframe. The closet door swings shut behind me.

I try to pull it open. It will not budge.

The darkness presses in, thicker than the air outside. My breath comes in shallow, ragged gasps. Then I hear it, a faint creak, like the doll is shifting, turning its head.

I am trapped. And suddenly, I realize I never left the closet in the first place.

My fingernails scrape against the old wood as I yank at the knob. For a sick second I am sure it is not going to open, that I am going to die in this closet with the thing I have feared since I was a kid. Then, with a groan, the door finally gives way and I stumble backward into the bedroom.

The doll falls forward, its porcelain limbs clattering against the floorboards.

It is not smiling anymore.

The once-patient face is twisted, jaw open just enough to show faintly carved teeth, its painted eyes narrowed into an expression I can only describe as rage. The lips, cracked with age, look like they are about to split open and scream.

I do not wait to find out. I bolt.

I am halfway down the hall before I realize I am running toward the kitchen. The smell of old spice racks and stale coffee hits me, a smell I have not known in decades. My heart is hammering so hard it feels like the walls are shaking with it.

And then I see it.

On the counter, between a stack of yellowed newspapers and an unplugged toaster, sits a toy I have not seen in thirty years. A thick, hollow plastic Pillsbury Doughboy. Its tiny hands frozen in a mock wave, that stupid little chef’s hat perched on its head.

My knees go weak. Suddenly I am seven again.

I can hear it, even now, the soft pitter-patter of plastic feet running across the linoleum at night. The giggle. That high-pitched hoo-hoo echoing from the dark kitchen while everyone else slept. I used to tell my grandma about it and she would slap me for making up stories. But it was not a story. I remember it.

A sound breaks me out of the memory. A thud from outside. Heavy, like something hitting the wall just under the kitchen window.

I spin, yanking the curtain aside. Nothing. Just the dead yard and the skeletal remains of her rose bushes.

When I turn back, the Doughboy’s head is gone.

It is sitting next to the toy’s body on the counter, separated cleanly as if someone had popped it off like a bottle cap.

And the tiny, hollow body is still standing perfectly upright.


I needed to get out of the kitchen. Out of the house. But something inside me said do not run. Maybe it was pride. Maybe it was Grandma’s voice, the one I still sometimes heard in my sleep.

I forced myself back into the living room, trying to ignore the noise of my own heartbeat. The smell of dust and mothballs clung to everything. I grabbed a cardboard box from the pile near the sofa and started tossing her knick-knacks into it just to keep my hands busy. China teacups. A cracked snow globe. A dozen little figurines she kept on a shelf I was never allowed to touch.

As I wrapped each piece in yellowed newspaper, another memory bubbled up. Grandma sitting in her chair late at night, chain-smoking with the lights off except for the glow of the TV. She would tell me things back then, half-lullabies, half-warnings.

I know how to tie my spirit to an object, she said once, her voice low and rasping. When I pass, I can stay in this realm. Watch over you. Protect you from the evil world.

I thought she was just scaring me, or trying to make herself sound magical. She even showed me once. She pressed a hand against one of her little trinkets, a porcelain cat, a silver thimble, and whispered something under her breath. I did not understand the words. She said the items were her eyes. Her hands.

Now, packing up these same knick-knacks, I notice something. The items are warm. Not just warm from the house, warm like skin.

I drop one into the box and it rattles against the others. I swear I hear something shift in the next room, like a chair being dragged across the floor.

Grandma always said she would never leave me alone. She said she would be here when the world turned ugly.

And all at once it hits me, maybe she was not lying.


I freeze as I hear it, the soft gurgle of a percolator bubbling in the kitchen. The smell hits me, thick and red, almost black, curling through the stale air like it never left.

I step toward the sound, every muscle in my body screaming not to, and push open the kitchen door.

The sight almost stops my heart.

The doll is sitting in one of the kitchen chairs, its face still twisted with anger, jaw set, eyes burning like coals. The Pillsbury Doughboy sits on the table, headless, but now its hollow little face mirrors the same rage, like it learned from the doll.

And there she is. My grandmother. Smoke curling from the end of her cigarette like a wisp of something unreal, leaning against the counter as if she never left. She pours coffee into two mugs, hands steady and calm, completely normal except everything around her is not.

Her shadow stretches across the floor and the walls. At first it mimics her movements. Then it does not. It slithers and lingers, separating from her form, twisting as if watching me, alive in a way she is not.

Stop pissing your pants, James, she says, voice low and amused, the smoke curling around her like a halo. Come have some coffee with me.

The smell is intoxicating, warm, familiar, almost sweet in its thickness, but the color makes my stomach twist. My heart pounds, but against all reason, against all fear, something in me steps forward.

Her eyes meet mine. They are the same eyes I remember, soft, knowing, but there is something else there now. Something patient. Watching. Waiting.

And for the first time, I realize she has not left me. She never really left.",2,1759629234.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1nybk15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nybk15/am_i_wrong_for_not_wanting_sex_as_often_as_my/,Am I wrong for not wanting sex as often as my husband? I really need advice.,"Hi everyone, I really need some honest advice. I don’t know if I’m wrong here or if anyone else has gone through something similar.

My husband and I have been married for almost 9 years and have 3 small kids. We’re a Christian couple, but it wasn’t always like that. We’ve been through a lot honestly, more than I can even put into words.

He was an alcoholic for many years, and during that time, I went through a lot of hurt and trauma. By the grace of God, he’s now a recovering alcoholic, and it’s been a slow but steady process. I’ve always stood by him, even through the hardest times when I was left to care for our kids alone.

At one point, I decided to separate from him for a year. Completely distance myself from him. During that year, I lived completely independently, raising my kids, running my business, and focusing on healing. While he was in away (not in a good place)…. After that year, God restored us, and we decided to give our marriage another chance and allowing God to continue healing.. he also gave himself to God.

Since then, things have been better in some ways, but one issue keeps coming up — sex.

We’ve been doing therapy, we’ve done marriage counseling at church, and trying to communicate better. Anything to work on our marriage. 

But my husband feels like I don’t make him happy because I don’t have sex with him “as often as he wants.” He says I “only want to have sex when I want to.”

For context, we usually have sex 2–3 times a week, sometimes once when life gets hectic. When we do, it’s always good he’s satisfied, I’m satisfied, and it’s never boring. But if a few days go by without it, he starts to get upset.

We both work long hours, I run a busy beauty business, he works full-time, and we have 3 little ones. Our life is constantly moving, and sometimes I’m just not in the mood. Sometimes, I just want to relax and spend quality time together without it always leading to sex.

A few nights ago, we had a really bad argument about it. Well he yelled and I decided to be wise and stay completely quiet to be wise… all I could do at that moment was cry… 

Two of our kids were with their aunt, and we only had the baby. We had a quiet evening, rested, watched TV, just enjoyed being home. Something’s that rare but like I said we’re always on the go. We even got to rest on our couch, I can’t even tell you when was the last time we did that. Then he asked if we were going to have “sexy time.” I honestly wasn’t in the mood. Not because I don’t love him, but because I was tired and comfortable.

We had already had sex earlier that week, only 3 days before. Eventually said “fine, but it has to be quick.” Then an hour passed, and I changed my mind, told him maybe in the morning. That’s when everything exploded because “I didn’t go through with my word after I told him we were going to have sex.”

He started yelling, saying I don’t give a F*** about his feelings, that I’m not a good wife, that he wants out of the marriage because he “can’t be in a relationship without sex.” That I’m not ready for a marriage, that I still have an immature mentality. That we’re both healthy people and should be having sex. He cursed at me, told me f*** you, and said I’m only a good mom and business owner but basically not a good wife.

It brought back all the memories of how he used to be when he was drinking.. the yelling, the disrespect, the aggression. I started crying, and he said I was just “playing the victim.” That all he said was a like “F***” word and I’m crying… 

The manipulation.. to make me think I was wrong for feeling hurt and crying.. after he promised he would never speak to me that way again… after he just did a whole re proposal a month ago… how am I supposed to feel?  

He also said I’m not following what our therapist taught us. But it had only been 3 days since the last time. Since then, I’ve made an effort like he’s been asking of me. Making his coffee, being affectionate, showing love but it feels like if I’m not giving him sex, none of that matters. He oversees everything.

Then last night, I found out he was going through my phone while I slept. He basically insinuated that he can’t trust me. A little back story during our 1 year separation, I was seeing other people. I’ve already taken accountability for that and I understand that in the past, his actions led me to seek validation from others which I know was wrong. But I’ve repented, grown, and completely given myself back to God and my marriage.

Now he’s back to being aggressive in the way he talks, and honestly, I’m completely turned off by the whole situation. It’s like no matter what I do to show love and effort, it’s never enough unless I’m giving him my body.

I also understand that the Bible says a wife should not deny herself to her husband (and vice versa), and he brings that up a lot. I respect that I truly do. But I also feel like if it’s only been a few days and I’m just not in the mood, that should be okay too. I’m not depriving him of sex, I just need grace and understanding sometimes. 

I’ve forgiven things that most women wouldn’t, and I’ve poured everything into this marriage as a wife, a mother, and a woman of faith even when he did not deserve it. But moments like this make me feel small, disrespected, and pressured. I feel like I have to give in just to keep the peace, and that’s not what intimacy should feel like in a marriage.

I don’t know what to think anymore. Am I wrong for not wanting sex as often? How do you balance desire, exhaustion, and respect in marriage? I just want to feel loved for more than what I can give physically.

There is so much I’ve missed on this post of everything we’ve been through in a total of 12 years and I just can’t believe I’m still being treated with disrespect…. 

Please be honest, I really need advice.

We dated, engaged, married within 14 months. We have never had any depth to our relationship. He was ashamed to show emotion, never shared his opinions or views on anything unless it was politics (ugh). I eventually felt as if my emotions weren't allowed in the relationship and I felt like I was walking on eggshells waiting for his next shut down where I'd have to beg and cry for him to tell me what is going on - he never would. We have 3 young kids (6y,3y,1.5y) and it felt like I had a 4th child. He was so harsh with the kids and never letting them be kids.

I would ruin his day asking to go vacuum upstairs and it would be all over his face because that meant he couldn't drink his coffee on the couch but instead ""watch"" his kids while I cleaned.

I went to him 7 months ago and said I was done. He suddenly woke up. He dove into self-development books, conferences, counseling (after years of me begging). It felt like a trauma bonding situation. I hated it. My resentment was so high. I was so angry that because I was ""flipping his world upside down"" that I suddenly mattered. I agreed to counseling, honestly for the sake of our kids.

He has had a lot of emotional damage from his childhood and the No More Mr Nice Guy book was basically written about him, but his selfish and self-centered tendencies are so pervasive that I don't think any ""work"" he's doing on himself is going to change that part of him.

For example, he finds nothing wrong with leaving our kids asleep at 5am to go on a one mile run for 10 mins every morning in this 50/50 custody split we have. His response to me freaking out is that he needs to prioritize his health and well being too. 

He wants to fix us, repair, commit, and find ""common ground"" and ""align on things"" but I truly don't think any of that is going to change how he only takes action when it impacts him.

Am I crazy for giving up half of my kids lives because being alone, free, and a better version of myself for them vs taking a chance on him changing?",2,1759628205.0,Separation,1,1.0,False

I messed up and spilled coffee over the gear shift section, unfortunately there seems to be a gap here in this red circle and I saw lots of liquid pour down there... How screwed am I?

Is this something I can flag at my next service and pay extra for to have it cleaned out/fixed up?

Chapter 15: Trust

Bryce awoke with a start, some vivid dream she already couldn’t quite remember pulling at her subconscious. She blinked a few times, trying to sort out where her imagination ended and reality began. She turned to gaze at Azriel’s sleeping body, but the other side of the bed was empty.

Azriel was gone.

She jolted upright, still trying to clear the morning — well, afternoon — haze from her eyes. That side of the mattress was cold, as if it hadn’t been slept in for hours. She shook her head at herself and dragged herself out of bed, sliding on fuzzy slippers and her matching robe.

She strode down the hallway, not finding him in the bathroom or spare bedroom. The living room and kitchen were both empty.

“Hello?” she called out. Only silence answered her. She turned around in a circle, head spinning as she peeked out at the balcony. There was no sign of him anywhere. 

She was exhausted enough to believe she’d imagined his whole visit to Midgard. To believe that the time had come at last, and she’d finally snapped. Her bones felt hollow. She returned to her bedroom, looking for any clues she’d missed. Her eyes immediately zeroed in on her leather outfit from the night before, sopping in the corner with a ruby-hilted golden dagger sheathed beside it.

So he’d been real — *my psychotic break must be still to come, then*. *Guess that’s a plus.* But that meant everything else had to have been real, too. Including Hunt’s apparent double life.

Bryce felt like she was going to be sick.

She made her way back to the kitchen, clumsily inhaling all the water she could fit in her body. The night before came in hazy bits and pieces, seemingly stitched out of order like someone had rearranged her memories while she slept. She’d forgotten this part — not just the hangover, but the brain fog and utter depletion after a week of rampant substance abuse. 

All she wanted was more mirthroot. But she had too much thinking to do today — too much to entangle. Blissful complacency would have to wait. With a groan that echoed through her empty apartment, Bryce dragged her feet to begin getting ready. 

She pulled on leggings and a cropped tank top, both black as night like her pathetic Starborn soul. Before she had time to regret her choices, she threw her hair into a ponytail, stuffed her feet into her already tied sneakers, and burst out the door. 

She hadn’t gone for a run since long before Azriel had come. She was feeling it in every muscle as she broke into a steady jog. She had a splitting headache, nausea churning through her with every jolted step. She figured this could go two ways: either she’d miraculously feel better, or she’d vomit much quicker. Either way seemed like a win at this point.

Her thoughts raced far faster than her legs. Images of Hunt and dead mortals and vengeful queens haunted her every uneven breath. *We’re gameplanning tomorrow,* Ruhn had said. But what plan was there to hatch? She couldn’t force Hunt to tell her the truth, and he wasn’t stupid enough to leave a trail behind if he didn’t want to be caught. 

She wished she could talk to him. Not this cagey version of him that seemed to appear whenever shit hit the fan, but the real him. Just Hunt. Bullshit aside, she missed her closest friend.

That realization ached through her chest, only serving to confuse her feelings even more. How was she supposed to come up with some scheme against someone she loved? What would she even do if the truth turned out to be as ugly as she feared? 

Her feet pounded harder into the pavement. 

She ran until she was slick with sweat, heart pounding in her ears almost loud enough to drown out the endless assault of thoughts. Gasping for air, she set her sights on a particularly appealing bench and sprinted the last of the distance, collapsing onto her back in an ungraceful heap. The stone was cold, soothing her flushed skin immediately as she waited for her heart to slow. Her limbs dangled while she counted her breaths, peeking up at the sky above. It was blazing blue, fluffy white clouds crawling by at a glacial pace. 

She couldn’t remember the last time she watched the clouds from this angle, flat on her back with the rest of the world barely brushing her periphery. Couldn’t remember the last moment she’d been still. 

*Fine, then.* She’d lie on this godsdamned bench until enlightenment waded through the muddy waters of her mind to find her. She watched for shapes in the clouds, smirking and grimacing at the various reminders they presented. A distinctly canine silhouette ripping at the ever-present wound in her chest. An hourglass with the perfect amount of sass to evoke Lehabah. A unicorn, flying high on the breeze. A mother’s warm embrace. She’d almost forgotten her troubles when massive, arching wings cascaded into her view. 

Bryce clenched her teeth. He’d really just up and left like that. He’d kissed her in a way that was sure to be imprinted on her very soul for the rest of time, and then he’d just *left?* It’s not like she hadn’t learned the hard way that males were all the same, but still — she’d thought Azriel was different. Although maybe he was, because most of them at least waited until *after* getting in her pants to bail. He couldn’t have even been bothered to stick around for that, apparently. Maybe he’d finally gotten sick of Bryce’s relentless teasing. Or worse, he’d decided it wasn’t worth all the effort. 

Of course it wasn’t. What had she offered him but chaos and confusion? She couldn’t believe he’d been able to stand her enough to stay as long as he did, even before the whole fountain fiasco.

*Bitch, get a grip.* She shook her head and groaned at the sky. The Ocean Queen was seizing the City piece by piece, Hunt was doing drugs with Demon Daddy #1, and the Princes were apparently hatching some evil plan to destroy the world, or whatever the fuck — and she was moping over Azriel going home? Only she could find a way to avoid her real problems by creating even more dramatic ones out of thin air. Of course he’d gone back. She always knew he would, and he didn’t owe her any explanations. This wasn’t his home. She had no reason to feel so empty inside. 

Still, the hollowness persisted. 

She forced her attention back to the clouds, but they all just looked like amorphous blobs. Whatever runner’s high had been fueling her imagination before was clearly depleted. She was about to give up entirely when a dark blur passed overhead, lower than the clouds but still unthinkably far off the ground. Faster than her brain could comprehend, the blur swept over her and towards the river behind her, casting a trail of shadows over her body as it passed. She could have sworn she saw cobalt glint under the blinding afternoon sun all the way from here.

She sat upright, allowing herself two breaths to steady herself before she pulled herself to her feet and began running towards home. Maybe she was completely delusional, but she had nothing left to lose at this point. 

She knew that blur. Azriel was still here.

\*\*\*\* 

She burst through her apartment door, completely breathless and tank top soaked through with sweat. Azriel was standing in the kitchen, frozen in the middle of biting a tissue-wrapped pastry. Bryce stopped in her tracks, staring at him like a deer in headlights. 

“Are you alright?” he finally asked through his full mouth, gulping it down.

The question reignited the flame that had been burning in Bryce for days. Years, really. “No, I am most certainly not *alright*,” she seethed as she stalked towards him, pushing his chest and sending him staggering into the counter behind him. 

He raised his eyebrows, appraising her from head to toe as she glowered up at him. “Fighting again, are we?”

“I thought you *left!*” 

“I got breakfast,” Azriel murmured with an amused smirk on his face, gesturing to the spread before them. There were two coffees besides a veritable buffet, fruits and eggs and meats and pastries covering the counter. 

“Well, how the Hel was I supposed to know that?” Bryce retorted. “I assumed you’d finally had your fill of this place and went back home.” 

Amusement still lit his face, but his eyes darkened as he studied her. “And that bothered you?” 

“Of course it did! You didn’t even say goodbye.” 

He took a step closer, towering above her as he gently grabbed her hand. “I promise to never leave without saying goodbye,” he said in a low voice, eyes burning into hers. She swallowed, fury or embarrassment or something deeper still scorching her from the inside. 

“You could have at least left a note,” she grumbled, rolling her eyes if only for an excuse to escape the intensity of his gaze. He chuckled softly, tugging her hand and leading her behind him. She was too tired to argue, exhaustion settling in while her adrenaline dissipated as quickly as it’d come. Her legs already felt like they weighed a million pounds.

He led her into the bedroom, and her heartbeat quickened again as they headed right for the bed. Azriel leaned over to her side, plucking a piece of paper from her nightstand and offering it to her. She yanked it out of his hands, eyes skimming over the few words scrawled across the page. 

*I imagine you’ll need some food to soak up all that whiskey — I’ll be back before you wake up. -Az*

Bryce scowled, unable to look him in the eye as she accepted defeat. “Fine. You win.” Embarrassment flushed her cheeks. She may have *slightly* overreacted. 

“Say that again,” he teased in a low voice, earning another scowl from Bryce before he tugged their still joined hands again. “Come on. Let’s eat before it gets cold.” 

\*\*\*\*\*

“I told my brother everything that’s been going on last night,” she admitted quietly between bites.

Azriel simply nodded and said,“Good.”

She raised an eyebrow. “You’re not going to tell me how reckless I am for looping someone else into our evil plans?” 

“Why would I do that?” His face was absolutely bewildered.

“I don’t know, I mean… you’re not mad at me for telling him who you really are?”

Azriel went from bewildered to incredulous. “He’s your brother. I would never ask you to keep secrets from him or anyone else you deem worthy of your trust. Especially not on my account.”

“When we first met, you seemed much more invested in keeping that kind of intel hidden from us scary Midgardian aliens,” she pointed out. 

Azriel shrugged, eating his food in his usual silence. 

Bryce didn’t know why she kept pushing, but she couldn’t help herself. “What, one week of living with my charms has won you over already? You can’t possibly trust me or my judgment that much — even I’m not stupid enough to believe that.” 

“First of all,” he said sternly, leveling her with his smoldering eyes, “Your judgment may be questionable at times, but you’re far from stupid. Anyone would be a fool not to see that.” Bryce blushed, looking back to the fruit she’d piled on her plate and picking through it. “And second, I don’t trust anyone. I’d like to try, though.” 

Bryce sighed, feeling the weight of his words and knowing deep in her soul that she would never deserve them. “Don’t bother,” she muttered to her plate. “Trusting people has only ever fucked me over. They all keep secrets when it really matters, and it only hurts more when you delude yourself into thinking they won’t.” 

She stabbed a piece of melon, sliding it off her fork with her teeth aggressively enough to make a scraping sound, juices exploding with late summer ripeness. Azriel didn’t speak for a long while, chewing his food and solemnly gazing out the window. When they’d both finished, she began to gather their plates, but still he stared. 

“What’s so interesting?” she snapped more icily than she’d intended. Her head was still pounding from the bottle of whiskey she’d basically chugged last night. 

Azriel didn’t seem to notice. “When I was a boy,” he began, seemingly out of nowhere, “my family was very cruel.” Bryce had to stop her jaw from falling open. Azriel barely ever talked about himself, much less his childhood. She did her best to settle the hangover-fueled irritation boiling her blood, turning her full attention towards him as he spoke, eyes still locked somewhere far away. “My father sired me out of wedlock, much to his wife’s dismay,” he continued. “She was downright irate when I was born male, and my father took me from my mother to raise yet another warrior. Their children, my brothers, never saw me as such. My step-mother was even less kind. I was an abomination — a walking reminder of their father’s betrayal. The family shame. I was forbidden from training. Truthfully, I was barely allowed outside the darkness of my room. They came to me only to taunt me, seeming to enjoy riling me up. Especially if it involved disparaging my mother. The boys grew older, and one day words were not enough to satisfy them.” 

He paused then, looking down at his battered hands. Bryce drew in a sharp breath, stomach queasy as she guessed the direction of this tale.

“Illyrian warriors saved me, but not soon enough to prevent the scarring. I was with their healers for weeks. They returned me to my father after that, most of them without a second thought… but the two that had first rescued me found excuses to stop by every so often, always insisting to lay eyes on me before leaving. For a long time, I thought they were sizing me up for battle training, but now I realize it was kindness. There was a reason my brothers left me alone after that. A few years later, they all grew bored of me and dropped me off at the nearest Illyrian training camp. Most of our kind had been flying as long as they’d been walking, preparing for this in some way… and I’d spent over a decade basically locked in a cell. I don’t know what would have become of me, if not for who I met that first night in the camp.” For the first time since he’d begun his story, he turned his attention back to Bryce. She blinked, realizing that tears were welling in her eyes as she imagined the sad, scared little boy still living somewhere inside of the hulking warrior before her.

“Who did you meet?” she asked, doing her best to blink the tears away. 

Azriel grimaced slightly before responding, as if anticipating her reaction. “Rhysand and Cassian. They taught me everything. Rhys’ mother took me into their home. They became the brothers I never had.” 

Bryce suppressed the urge to roll her eyes, although the ire she usually felt at the High Lord of Night was quelled by something resembling gratitude. At least *someone* had been there to comfort that little boy, even if it had to be Rhysand. Bryce reached to wrap his scarred hand in hers, starlight dimly flaring between their intertwined fingers. Azriel was quiet again, like the song had finally ended, leaving only dead air behind. 

“Why did you tell me all that?” she whispered, staring at their locked hands. At the horrible, beautiful scars left by his monstrous excuse of a family. A fire roared back to life within her, one she’d thought had been extinguished with the Autumn King’s last breath, begging to engulf those responsible until there was nothing left but dust. “Not that I’m complaining. You’re just not usually so… forthcoming,” she added, not wanting him to get the wrong idea. 

“Because trust is difficult for me, as well — but I never would have survived if I didn’t learn to try. Trusting them saved my life. Trusting your friends might just save yours. None of us are meant to fight alone.” 

“Spoken like a true soldier,” Bryce quipped, unable to help cracking a joke as discomfort slithered through her stomach. She took a few deep breaths before nodding. “Point taken, though. I do have a habit of trying to figure everything out on my own.” 

“Really? I hadn’t noticed,” Azriel teased, smirking as he squeezed her hand. 

“Well, it’s not my fault I’m so much smarter and cooler than everyone else around me,” she snapped, earning a soft laugh from Azriel.

“Certainly not,” he agreed with a smile. “So, what’s the plan for today?”

 

Bryce groaned, every ounce of her dreading the day before them. “Well, I’m supposed to let my brother help us come up with some genius plan to solve all our problems, which is a hilarious sentence I never thought I’d say with a straight face. I think I need a few hours to recover before I can handle whatever the Hel that’s going to be like.” 

Azriel chuckled, nodding. “I need to bathe, as well — I still smell like pond scum.” 

Bryce giggled, cheeks flushing for what felt like the hundredth time already today. “Yeah, same here. I don’t know if there’s any saving those leather clothes.” 

“You can go first,” he said politely, standing to clear the table.

“You don’t want to join me? I was starting to think watching me get wet was your thing,” she teased  with a wink before she could think better of it, averting her gaze once the double meaning of her words echoed back to her.

Azriel let out a long sigh before joining Syrinx on the couch, eyes scorching into hers from across the room. He shook his head, a smirk lighting up his face before replying flatly, “Enjoy your shower.”

\*\*\*\*

There wasn’t a cold enough setting in her shower. Bryce spent as long as she could getting ready, forcing her brain to focus on the business at hand as best she could. 

Mirthroot helped.

She sat on the balcony with a fresh cup of coffee while Azriel showered, not letting herself replay her stupid words from earlier. Too soon, the glass door was sliding open, and she cringed slightly. She sure had a knack for always taking things a step too far at the wrong time.

Fortunately for her, Azriel had already moved on. Unfortunately for her, his distraction came in the shape of Jelly Jubilee, who was now in his hand. He held it up wordlessly with raised eyebrows, and Bryce sighed, waiting for the jokes that were sure to come.

“Jelly Jubilee, more fondly known as JJ. She’s my favorite childhood toy to whom I’ve maintained a borderline unhealthy devotion throughout adulthood — a devotion which is sure to live on for the rest of time.” 

“Well, I almost beheaded her by mistake,” he said with a grin. “She was lying helplessly on the floor, right in the path of my clothing. I assume she has a safer resting place than that?” 

Bryce couldn’t help but giggle back. “My night stand will do.” 

He smiled broader before disappearing back into the apartment, returning after a few minutes with empty hands.

“Safe and sound?” Bryce asked brightly, passing her burning mirthroot to him.

Azriel nodded, taking a hit as he settled in beside her. 

A grim thought crossed her mind. “You didn’t get to have a favorite childhood toy, did you?” 

He shook his head as he exhaled a cloud of smoke, and Bryce couldn’t stop herself from grabbing his free hand. “Why the horse?” he asked finally.

Bryce gasped in mock annoyance. “She is a limited edition unicorn pegasus, thank you very much. A *horse*,” she scoffed.

“Are there pegasuses here?” he asked quietly.

“Yes, and they’re spectacular. Remind me to show you them before you leave,” she added dreamily. “I haven’t visited in too long, and I miss them.”

“I’ve seen them before.”

She whipped her head around to face him. “Where?”

Azriel smiled again. “In Prythian — only in the Day Court. They’re very rare. Legends say they once ruled the skies, hailing from the Prison’s island.” 

“They’re rare here, too. Sadly.” 

“Where are they?” Azriel asked. 

She picked at her grown out manicure. “A place called Avallen. It’s incredible. It was this horrible, misogynistic Hel pit for a while, but we took care of that when we were fighting the Asteri. I’m sort of the Queen — or at least I was. Debatable now that I ruined the whole monarchy thing. But either way, it’s a beautiful island. Or archipelago, now, I guess. A lot changed really fast,” she added exasperatedly.

Azriel raised his eyebrows.

“It’s a long story — I guess I skipped over this when we had our *Bryce’s Trauma Dump 101* seminar. Basically, the land had withered away, and it woke up when I claimed the part of Theia’s power that was hidden in there. It’s a lot like that Prison island, actually. Even had spooky caves that were almost identical. And yes, I did have to jump into the freezing cold water again, as I’m sure you’ll be thrilled to hear.”

He didn’t speak, chewing on his lip while he stared into the distance. Bryce shook off the memories of those caves — her last sight of her horrible father. She wondered if Azriel’s own monstrous sire was still alive. He and the Autumn King would make great roommates in the After Life.

“Well, I guess I have some phone calls to make,” Bryce declared, determined not to give either of those assholes another second of her thoughts. She stretched before she stood to rummage through the cushions for her phone. 

Azriel stood and started making his way towards the door, seemingly to give her some privacy. 

“Wait,” she called, instinctively grabbing his arm and yanking him into a hug before she could doubt herself. He wrapped his arms around her at once, and she inhaled his fresh cedar scent that had become so familiar, as if she’d always known it. “I’m so sorry for what your family did to you” she nearly whispered into his chest, and she felt his muscles stiffen beneath her embrace. “And I’m glad you came here. I’m sure this past week has been way more complicated than whatever you had in mind, and I don’t know how I would’ve dealt with it all without you. I know you’ll never actually be able to trust me after what happened in Prythian, despite all the strangely nice things that you say… but for whatever it’s worth, I just want you to know that I do. I trust you. Or I’m trying to, at least.” 

Azriel tightened his grip on her, bending down to press his lips against the top of her head. She felt her cheeks blush at the tenderness, feeling more exposed than when she was parading naked in front of him. He lingered for a minute before finally pulling away. “I’ll leave you to it, then,” he said, striding gracefully back into her apartment.

Bryce let out a long breath, staring at the spot where he disappeared through the sliding door. Finally, she shook her head, forcing herself into action.

\*\*\*\*

“Hey, Pax.” Bryce tried to muffle the guilt stabbing at her. Of course, *now* she’d find the time to call her dear old friend. When she needed something.

“Bryce! I’m so glad you called.” Wind roared in the background, and Bryce could hear Hypaxia’s heeled boots clacking through the phone.

“Me too. Are you busy tonight?”

“That depends on what you’re going to ask next,” Hypaxia quipped.

Bryce laughed. “I need a favor. Can you come over soon?” 

“I have some rogue Reapers to wrangle, but I can be there in about an hour?”

“Perfect. I promise to reward you with all the liquor you can drink.” Hypaxia’s giggle was like warm honey, sweet and soothing to the core. Bryce smiled before adding, “Oh, and Pax? Bring that handy dandy potions bag of yours. I’m afraid we might need it.” 

\*\*\*\*

Bryce shifted awkwardly on her feet, taking in the eyes waiting on her to speak. Too many eyes. 

Hypaxia arrived exactly when she’d said she would, giant sack of magic in tow. Bryce prayed it would be enough for the night they were about to face. 

Ruhn had filled Lidia in on the whole mess before they came upstairs. She hadn’t said a word, wrapping Bryce in a tight, long hug before they settled in next to Hypaxia on the couch. The sisters had exchanged warm smiles, Lidia squeezing her hand before they turned their attention back to Bryce. Azriel sat tensely in the chair beside them, a warrior awaiting his battle plan.

A whole hour she’d had to prepare for this, and still she felt like a nervous school girl standing before the class. Bryce cleared her throat. “Well, everyone else already knows all this, so we’ll catch you up on the details, Pax, but long story short, Hunt’s being shady as fuck. Apparently, he’s been secretly becoming besties with the Princes of Hel, and I’m pretty sure he’s using synth. I need all of your help figuring out what he’s doing before he gets himself or someone else killed.” 

Lidia nodded fiercely while Ruhn draped an arm around her shoulders. Hypaxia’s eyes were wide.

“Synth? Why would he do that?” she asked in horror, clearly remembering what havoc that particular substance had wreaked on Bryce’s life. Havoc that Hunt should’ve known better than anyone.

Bryce grimaced. “That’s what we need to figure out. I don’t even know for sure if that’s what he’s using, but last night, he was shooting something up with one of his new pals at the Meat Market after he lied to me about talking to them. Oh, and if we can figure out what the Princes’ big evil plan is, that would be super amazing — I have reasons to believe they’re up to something, but I have no idea what, so don’t ask. Probably ending the world like everyone else. Don’t they know there’s a line?” Bryce scoffed, rolling her eyes dramatically.  

Hypaxia’s face was solemn, resolve steeling her beautiful features into something fiercer. Something that made sure there was no hiding the fact she was Lidia Cervos’ sister. Her voice was steady, ringing with queenly authority as the crown of bones gleamed bright atop her head. “How can we help?”

Bryce blinked to keep her eyes from watering at the depth of her loyalty. She yearned to be the kind of person who deserved it — but she never would be. Not in a thousand lifetimes. 

She let out a long sigh. “Honestly, I have no idea. He won’t talk to me about it, and I don’t even know if I’m right. I need a plan that doesn’t blow everything up for once. Any ideas?” She asked the question to everyone, but her eyes slid right to Lidia’s calculating gaze. 

“Where is he keeping it?” she asked Bryce.

“Keeping what?”

“The drugs. If he’s using, he has to have a stash somewhere. Where would he hide it?” 

Bryce shook her head, eyes darting around the apartment like it might tell her the answers. “He’s been staying at the barracks.”

“Then we need a way to get him out — long enough to search it.” 

“You want to break into the barracks?!” Ruhn exclaimed, whipping his head to his mate.

“No,” she said calmly. “I want Flynn and Declan to break in while we keep Hunt distracted.”

“Ithan should do it,” Hypaxia asserted, and they all looked at her in confusion. “He’s the Prime now — no one will question him too hard if he's caught. Plus, he’s a wolf. A canine sense of smell might come in handy.”

“But Declan can hack into the security cameras,” Lidia argued. “He can track Hunt’s movements.” The sisters stared at each other, always towing the line between familiar and competitive. 

Bryce swallowed, betrayal snaking up to choke her. She already hated going behind Hunt’s back with Azriel last night. Was she really going to drag all his friends into it, too?

But she had no choice. Whatever he was doing, Bryce knew he was playing with fire. It was only a matter of time before he got burned. Relationship drama aside, she couldn’t stand by and watch. She couldn’t even bring herself to picture the worst that could happen. Like what happened to Danika.

“They’ll all go,” she decided. “As long as they’re willing, of course. It’s a good idea — both of you. Good teamwork,” she added with a wink, and Hypaxia smiled softly while Lidia averted her eyes. 

“But how are we supposed to distract Athalar long enough?” Ruhn asked, rubbing his temples.

Bryce looked at each of them, waiting for someone to jump in. Finally, her eyes landed on Azriel. He raised his chin, holding her gaze without a word. An idea flashed in her mind, and the corners of her lips perked up as she spoke. “We’re having a party tonight.” 

“A party?” her brother asked incredulously. “Are you guys even, like, on speaking terms? How the Hel are you going to get him to a party?”

Bryce shrugged. “I have my ways. Let’s focus on logistics. Where should we have it?”

“Why not here? Or the Autumn King’s villa?” Hypaxia asked.

Lidia shook her head. “Somewhere public — and with cameras, so we can watch what he does when we’re not looking.” 

“The White Raven, then,” Bryce said, clenching her teeth. The last night she’d spent there had basically been a fever dream, and she was in no rush to sully it up with this. But again, she had no choice.

“Who are we inviting?” Ruhn asked. 

“Convince him to bring Naomi and Isaiah,” Lidia ordered Bryce before turning to Hypaxia. “Can you test his blood for drugs?”

Hypaxia looked startled. “I… if you can get me some to test, sure, but how—”

“I have my ways,” Lidia cut in darkly. Her eyes softened when she turned to Bryce, and she offered a sympathetic smile.

Bryce held her gaze as she nodded, taking a deep breath to steel herself. 

“So, that’s the plan? Draw him out, steal his blood, and search his room?” she asked the group.

“And hack into the cameras,” Lidia added. 

“Right. And that.” Bryce chewed on her lip, stomach was churning as she visualized the night ahead.

“I have a question,” Hypaxia said. Bryce raised her eyebrows, but the witch turned her gaze to Azriel instead. “Who are you?”

He looked to Bryce for direction. “Sorry, Pax — this is my friend Azriel. We’ll have time to get acquainted later.” He hadn’t broken her gaze, a subtle flush coloring his cheeks.

“So, is that it?” Ruhn interjected. “We’re not going to interrogate Athalar, or beat some sense into him, or throw his ass in rehab?”

Lidia grabbed his hand. “Only if it comes to that,” she said softly. She turned back to Bryce. “Are you sure you want to do this?” 

“No,” she said honestly. 

“None of us will judge you, whatever you decide,” Hypaxia asserted. Bryce forced a tight smile at her, surveying each of them. Ruhn and Lidia both nodded, and she took another deep breath. Finally, she looked to Azriel again. He gave her a soft smile, barely perceptible but enough to warm at least the edges of the icy depths of her soul. 

He was right. She didn’t have to do everything alone.

With everything going on in the news recently with police brutality and innocent people being harmed why do we still allow our police to have zero accountability ?

In Montreal it's crazy common to see police texting while driving or breaking traffic laws for no justified reason beyond personal convenience. They will park wherever just to get coffee and they generally lack people or social skills. I still see officers in the greater Montreal area wearing the thin blue line patch even if it's supposedly not allowed. It's regularly documented how the spvm hurts protesters and civilians at protests. They abuse the privileges they have with firearms and they recklessly discharge resulting in the fatality of children.

1nybaxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1nybaxx/my_hobby_has_accidentally_become_collecting_books/,My hobby has accidentally become 'collecting' books instead of reading them.,"I have a confession to make. I think I'm better at buying books than I am at reading them. It starts innocently enough. I'll walk into a bookstore just to 'browse,' telling myself I'm only there for the coffee shop smell and the quiet atmosphere. But then I see it: a cover that's a work of art, a title that whispers promises of adventure, or a recommendation from an author I love. My self-control just evaporates.

The next thing I know, I'm at the counter with a stack of new paperbacks. The cashier gives me that knowing smile, and I feel a rush of excitement mixed with a familiar pang of guilt. I take my new treasures home and lovingly place them on my nightstand, on the bookshelf, on the coffee table... basically, any available surface. My apartment is starting to look like a dragon's hoard, but instead of gold, it's filled with unread stories.

My 'to-be-read' pile is no longer a pile; it's a sentient being that silently judges me. It watches me scroll through my phone, it watches me watch TV, and I swear I can hear its collective sigh of disappointment when I pick up the same book I've been 'reading' for three months. I have books I bought years ago that are still in pristine condition, their spines uncracked, their pages smelling like fresh ink and forgotten potential.

I know I can't be the only one. There's a special kind of joy in acquiring a new book that feels separate from the joy of actually reading it. It's the thrill of the hunt and the promise of a new world, all wrapped up in a beautiful package. But now, my shelves are overflowing. It's a beautiful problem to have, but a problem nonetheless.

So, my fellow book lovers of Reddit, what's your shelf-to-read ratio? At what point does a book collection turn into a beautiful library of guilt?",1,1759627604.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

For context my ex-wife (F24), and I (TF25) split just over a year ago. In our state, we were required to live separated for a year before officially filing for divorce, and of course, that window just passed. We got our divorce decree on the 22nd of September, and nothing was hairy with that. I wish that everyone's divorces could be this simple if they have to happen. We agreed to terms on all of our limited shared assets, parental rights for our 2 year son, child support, and basically everything else you can think of upon separating. That agreement rolled over into the divorce, so truly, it was as nice and easy as it could be.

Where things get a little tense is, of course, the house that we purchased together six months before separating. Excellent timing, I know. Over the past year, I have been scraping together cash, and after unfortunately pulling most of my retirement account, my new partner (M22) and I were able to refinance the house, and ex-wife signed away the deed. This scenario wasn't ideal either, but it was the best option I had available, so my partner and I now own this house. The law states that she has 30 days to get any remaining belongings out, and she intends to. I'm quite lenient and told her that there's no rush. Most of her stuff is stored underneath the house in those black totes with the yellow lids that I got from Costco, so it's no skin off of my back to have it here. Anyways, she wants to get all of that stuff plus some leftover furniture and whatnot tomorrow. Again, that's absolutely not a problem with me.

Now I do have a problem with her simply requesting that I not be at the house while she, her parents, and her new partner come to get her things. While I'll say that I certainly feel a fair bit of unease at the thought of her being here without me and potentially rifling through my things, the rational side of me trusts her enough that she most likely won't go doing any unnecessary digging. Sure there may be some things in kitchen cabinets and whatnot, or under the sinks in the bathroom that I simply forgot about, so I understand her checking that, but my likely irrational fears start to come in when I feel that she may take things we purchased together, like the coffee maker (I'd probably actually die), the living room TV that she won in a raffle in 2019, or even something as crazy as the shelves in our son's room. While sure, that would all stink, it can all be replaced, and I suppose I would accept the logic she'd hypothetically use to get there, my biggest fear is just my medication.

I know that I likely have nothing to worry about, but her mother and I had our first real conversation together since the early days of the separation yesterday evening when I was picking up my son for our weekend. In that conversation, which my ex was present for, but not active in, her mother reiterated to me that she still knows that I'm a good person, and that I'm trying my best to make sure that my son is being taken care of as best as he can be, she threw in a couple of things that were a bit jarring to me. 

Firstly, sorry, but there's more background. My ex and I had a bit of a tiff that morning regarding the fact that my partner posted a photo of my son on his Facebook in a big life update post, and changed his profile picture to the three of us sitting together. Ex and I agreed before our son was born not to post him online, and I had never mentioned that to my partner. I'm also not really on social media, like, at all, so I didn't know about the post. It is completely and utterly my fault for never relaying that information and things getting here. She brought it to my attention and sent me a text that was essentially that I had five minutes to get them taken down, or else. My partner and I quickly had them removed, I explained to him why we didn't want that, and the Facebook stalking cloud aside, he blocked her, and we largely moved on. In the conversation with my ex's mother she kind of alluded to me needing to have him ""get with it,"" and there was a lot of frustration behind it. 

Finally, the reason I'm here. I'm that same conversation, she brought up things about me finding myself, and how it seems selfish. I'll reiterate now that am undergoing gender transition. I started hormone replacement therapy in January after a lot of therapy and many, many breakdowns. My gender questioning was, in my eyes, one of the largest factors in our split. There were other things of course, I was severely depressed, ""the spark was gone,"" and she wanted to see other people. Anyways, I'm getting farther along with things and there is absolutely no denying my transition at this point, even if I wanted to. I don't know exactly what she was referring to when she suggested that me being the way I am, whether it is the fact that my son's father is dating a man, or the fact that his father is a woman now, I am going to make his life more difficult. I have no clue which one she meant at all. She said that she is ""speaking from experience,"" because her mother is gay and married to a woman. I didn't get anything beyond that out of it really other than a ton of shame, guilt, and anxiety. Everyone in my circles is telling me that what she said seems fairly messed up, but it still hit me through the chest really hard, and I fear everyone to be biased. I'm worried that if she was talking about my transitioning, not my partner being a man, that she could do something with my hormones if I'm not there. They're not easy to get, fairly expensive, and very necessary.

When making the request that we not be present, my ex said that she simply mentally needs space to get her things. I understand that she is still hurt by our split– she hasn't looked me in the eyes since. However, I feel that to be effective co-parents, we should be able to exist in the same space and fluidly communicate for our son's sake, and this would be a perfect step towards progress on that front. 

Geez, that was a lot of writing. I'm sitting here shaking, but I just need to know if I'm being unreasonable. Thank you for any and all comments. Even if you just read the post, truly, thank you.",2,1759627347.0,TwoHotTakes,12,0.57,False
1nyb7tt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyb7tt,Wiley Frost – “The Gentleman Ghost of the Plains”,"Lore:  
  
No one ever heard Wiley Frost raise his voice — and if you did, you didn’t live long enough to tell it.  
He rides a white Arabian named *Snowfall*, a creature as calm and pale as morning fog. Together, they glide through the frontier like winter come to life — silent, cold, and beautiful to behold.

Wiley wasn’t born into violence. They say he started as a traveling performer, a silver-tongued singer who dressed to impress and smiled for every crowd. But one night, when a jealous outlaw shot a man dead during his performance, Wiley didn’t scream, didn’t panic — he simply drew a revolver from under his fine white coat and put a bullet clean through the killer’s heart before the applause had even died down.

From that night on, the world learned a new truth: **a polite tone and steady hand make for a deadly mix.**

Folks started telling stories. That he could split a playing card mid-air with a flick of his wrist. That he once faced down six men at high noon — and the only sound after was the wind brushing over his hat brim. Some say he walks with a preacher’s calm, others say with the devil’s confidence. Both are probably right.

He wears white not for purity, but for irony — to stain it with the sins of those foolish enough to test him. And when he rides into a town, hat tipped low, coat shining in the sunlight, people know one thing for certain: someone’s about to be buried before sundown.

They call him **Wiley Frost** because his heart’s colder than the mountains, and his smile’s as sharp as the steel he carries.  
A gentleman in speech, a killer in motion — the kind of man who tips his hat after a duel, leaves a coin for the undertaker, and hums a tune as he walks away from the smoke.

And if you ever see him smile your way, best hope it’s from across the saloon — not down the barrel of his Colt.

The Legend of the ""***The Clearwater Massacre***"":

*The Clearwater Massacre, 1898*

They say it started with a gang called the **Ravens Hollow Boys** — a cruel bunch that ran their racket out by the river bend near Clearwater. Thirty men, all mean as snakes and twice as dumb, riding under a man named Cole Denton — a brute with a scar like a lightning bolt down his face. They robbed, burned, and left bodies swinging from trees like warnings in the wind.

One morning, they made the mistake of hitting the wrong stagecoach.  
Among the passengers was a man in a white duster, humming softly, hat tilted low, and a deck of cards tucked in his vest pocket.

They didn’t recognize him — not until three of their men hit the dust before they could even draw.  
By the time they realized who they’d crossed, *Wiley Frost* was already reloading.

Word spread fast that Denton and his boys were gunning for Frost.  
A week later, they found him in **Clearwater**, sitting outside a saloon, legs crossed, sipping coffee as if he didn’t have a care in the world. His horse, *Snowfall*, stood tied nearby — glistening white under the morning sun.

When Denton rode in with his gang, thirty strong, the townsfolk scattered. But Frost didn’t move. He just looked up, smiled, and said,  
  
“You boys sure brought an audience.”

They spread out around him — rifles, repeaters, shotguns — the whole town went dead quiet. Wiley set down his cup, brushed a bit of dust off his sleeve, and stood.  
  
“Before we start,” he said calmly, “someone fetch the undertaker. I don’t want him workin’ overtime.”

Then it began.

The first shot came from the balcony — a rifle crack that split the silence. Frost sidestepped, drew both revolvers in a blur, and the shooter fell before his body hit the wood. Then came the storm.

Bullets tore through the air, splintering walls, shattering glass, but Frost moved like he was *dancing*.  
He glided between cover, spun off posts, reloaded with one hand, firing in rhythm — **pow, pow, click, spin, pow.**

Five men dropped before they realized he wasn’t where they thought he was.  
Ten more before they even saw his eyes.

Smoke thickened, horses screamed, and through it all came the glint of white — his coat, his hat, his calm stride.

By the end, only Cole Denton was left standing, bleeding and shaking, his revolver empty.  
Wiley stepped out from the smoke, not a scratch on him, tipped his hat, and said,  
  
“You boys should’ve sent more.”

Then one shot rang out. Denton fell.  
Frost holstered his gun, grabbed his coffee cup off the ground, and took a sip — still warm.

They buried the Ravens Hollow Boys in a shallow grave by the river.  
And as the story spread, so did the legend — of **Wiley Frost**, the white-coated killer who could outshoot thirty men and still keep his drink hot.

Now, whenever the wind whistles through Clearwater, folks swear they can hear the faint sound of a man humming — slow, calm, and cold as winter.",0,1759627343.0,reddeadfashion,3,0.5,False

I really need advice.,"Hi everyone, I really need some honest advice. I don’t know if I’m wrong here or if anyone else has gone through something similar.

My husband and I have been married for almost 9 years and have 3 small kids. We’re a Christian couple, but it wasn’t always like that. We’ve been through a lot honestly, more than I can even put into words.

He was an alcoholic for many years, and during that time, I went through a lot of hurt and trauma. By the grace of God, he’s now a recovering alcoholic, and it’s been a slow but steady process. I’ve always stood by him, even through the hardest times when I was left to care for our kids alone.

At one point, I decided to separate from him for a year. Completely distance myself from him. During that year, I lived completely independently, raising my kids, running my business, and focusing on healing. While he was in away (not in a good place)…. After that year, God restored us, and we decided to give our marriage another chance and allowing God to continue healing.. he also gave himself to God.

Since then, things have been better in some ways, but one issue keeps coming up — sex.

We’ve been doing therapy, we’ve done marriage counseling at church, and trying to communicate better. Anything to work on our marriage. 

But my husband feels like I don’t make him happy because I don’t have sex with him “as often as he wants.” He says I “only want to have sex when I want to.”

For context, we usually have sex 2–3 times a week, sometimes once when life gets hectic. When we do, it’s always good he’s satisfied, I’m satisfied, and it’s never boring. But if a few days go by without it, he starts to get upset.

We both work long hours, I run a busy beauty business, he works full-time, and we have 3 little ones. Our life is constantly moving, and sometimes I’m just not in the mood. Sometimes, I just want to relax and spend quality time together without it always leading to sex.

A few nights ago, we had a really bad argument about it. Well he yelled and I decided to be wise and stay completely quiet to be wise… all I could do at that moment was cry… 

Two of our kids were with their aunt, and we only had the baby. We had a quiet evening, rested, watched TV, just enjoyed being home. Something’s that rare but like I said we’re always on the go. We even got to rest on our couch, I can’t even tell you when was the last time we did that. Then he asked if we were going to have “sexy time.” I honestly wasn’t in the mood. Not because I don’t love him, but because I was tired and comfortable.

We had already had sex earlier that week, only 3 days before. Eventually said “fine, but it has to be quick.” Then an hour passed, and I changed my mind, told him maybe in the morning. That’s when everything exploded because “I didn’t go through with my word after I told him we were going to have sex.”

He started yelling, saying I don’t give a F*** about his feelings, that I’m not a good wife, that he wants out of the marriage because he “can’t be in a relationship without sex.” That I’m not ready for a marriage, that I still have an immature mentality. That we’re both healthy people and should be having sex. He cursed at me, told me f*** you, and said I’m only a good mom and business owner but basically not a good wife.

It brought back all the memories of how he used to be when he was drinking.. the yelling, the disrespect, the aggression. I started crying, and he said I was just “playing the victim.” That all he said was a like “F***” word and I’m crying… 

The manipulation.. to make me think I was wrong for feeling hurt and crying.. after he promised he would never speak to me that way again… after he just did a whole re proposal a month ago… how am I supposed to feel?  

He also said I’m not following what our therapist taught us. But it had only been 3 days since the last time. Since then, I’ve made an effort like he’s been asking of me. Making his coffee, being affectionate, showing love but it feels like if I’m not giving him sex, none of that matters. He oversees everything.

Then last night, I found out he was going through my phone while I slept. He basically insinuated that he can’t trust me. A little back story during our 1 year separation, I was seeing other people. I’ve already taken accountability for that and I understand that in the past, his actions led me to seek validation from others which I know was wrong. But I’ve repented, grown, and completely given myself back to God and my marriage.

Now he’s back to being aggressive in the way he talks, and honestly, I’m completely turned off by the whole situation. It’s like no matter what I do to show love and effort, it’s never enough unless I’m giving him my body.

I also understand that the Bible says a wife should not deny herself to her husband (and vice versa), and he brings that up a lot. I respect that I truly do. But I also feel like if it’s only been a few days and I’m just not in the mood, that should be okay too. I’m not depriving him of sex, I just need grace and understanding sometimes. 

I’ve forgiven things that most women wouldn’t, and I’ve poured everything into this marriage as a wife, a mother, and a woman of faith even when he did not deserve it. But moments like this make me feel small, disrespected, and pressured. I feel like I have to give in just to keep the peace, and that’s not what intimacy should feel like in a marriage.

I don’t know what to think anymore. Am I wrong for not wanting sex as often? How do you balance desire, exhaustion, and respect in marriage? I just want to feel loved for more than what I can give physically.

There is so much I’ve missed on this post of everything we’ve been through in a total of 12 years and I just can’t believe I’m still being treated with disrespect…. 

Please be honest, I really need advice.

The Nevada Wolf Pack (1-3) and Fresno State Bulldogs (4-1) clash in a Mountain West showdown that’s as lopsided as a cafeteria lunchroom table. Let’s dissect the numbers, news, and why this game might as well be a dress rehearsal for Fresno State’s conference title campaign.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Fresno’s Payout is Thinner Than Nevada’s Offense

The betting market isn’t just favoring Fresno State—it’s *mocking* Nevada. On the moneyline, Fresno (-1200 implied probability) is priced like the inevitable sunrise, while Nevada (+5000) offers the thrill of a longshot akin to betting your coffee order will survive a barista’s mood swing. The spread? A brutal -13 for Fresno, meaning Nevada would need to *lose by 12 points* just to make this interesting.

Statistically, this makes sense. Fresno’s offense (372.4 ypg) is 33% more productive than Nevada’s (339.3 ypg), while its defense allows 15% fewer yards (320.6 vs. Nevada’s 380.8). The Wolf Pack’s quarterback, Chubba Purdy, is completing just 54.8% of his passes with a comically high 6 interceptions (to 1 TD). Meanwhile, Fresno’s E.J. Warner, despite 5 picks, is a 73.2% completion machine with 5 touchdowns. If football were a math test, Warner would acing calculus while Purdy’s still trying to count change.

### News Digest: Injuries, Momentum, and Why Fresno’s Bulldogs Are Smelling Blood

Fresno State enters on a three-game winning streak, including a nail-biting 23-21 victory over Hawaii that proved their resilience. Key playmakers like Rayshon Luke (258 yards, 5 TDs) and Bryson Donelson (326 yards, 3 TDs) are healthy, forming an offense that’s as reliable as a microwave (inconsistent but occasionally explosive).

Nevada? They’re the team that trips over its own shoelaces. After a 31-16 loss to Western Kentucky, the Wol

This is the endless dungeon crawl MOD where you fight with combines while farming ammos and health in procedurally generated rooms.

The combines have less health that 1 or 2 headshot will kill them, but their ability also increases a lot in around 50 floor that the combat becomes very intense and fast phased !

I had poured over 40 hours in this MOD alone. This is the perfect coffee break Gunfight in VR for me, possibly better than H3VR take and hold because I'm a fan of farming things in procedurally generated levels.

  
The shortcomings are the bosses who are invinsible to bullets and can only be killed with grenades, it feels artificial and not very fun to fight. At least you are not forced to kill them, just find keycard and escape.

Also the custom purse rifle appears in 31th floor but it's not very fun to use. no haptic feedback, yee yee ass iron sight, weird two handed grip , no upgrades... I just use the un-upgraded stock pistol for increased challenge.

  
The level of challenge just feels right in this MOD. not so easy as boring, also not too much hard to rage quit, just right amount of challenge keeping me trying again and again after death. Early floors are very short and easy but the real game starts around 30th floor.",6,1759626648.0,HalfLifeAlyx,0,0.88,False

1nyaxbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nyaxbh/how_to_spot_the_latest_portable_mug_warmer/,How to spot the latest portable mug warmer features?,"Hey fellow coffee lovers! I've been using various mug warmers for years, and I wanted to share my experiences and insights about the latest features I've discovered. Trust me, these aren't your grandma's mug warmers anymore!

I recently got my hands on a new portable mug warmer (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer), and I'm honestly blown away by how far this technology has come. Let me break down the cool features I've noticed in modern designs.

First off, temperature control is way more sophisticated now. The best ones let you dial in exactly how hot you want your drink, usually between 77°F to 158°F. No more burnt coffee or lukewarm tea! I've found this especially useful when I'm sipping different types of beverages throughout the day.

The auto-shut-off feature is a game-changer for forgetful people like me. Most new models automatically turn off after 4-8 hours, which is great for both safety and energy saving. Some even have gravity induction switches that power off when you remove your mug.

What really impressed me is the waterproof design in newer models. Coffee spills used to be a death sentence for old mug warmers, but now many are built with spill-resistant surfaces. This has saved my device multiple times during my clumsy morning moments!

Speaking of design, the latest portable warmers are seriously sleek. They're getting smaller and more lightweight, perfect for travel or moving between home and office. Some even come with USB power options, which is super convenient.

I've noticed that the heating plates are getting smarter too. Many now have even heat distribution and can detect when your mug is placed on them. If you're in the market for one, I'd highly recommend checking out this model I'm currently using: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. It's got all these features plus some extras I haven't even mentioned.

The LED displays are another neat addition. They show exact temperatures and have touch-sensitive controls instead of clunky buttons. Some even change color to indicate different heating stages.

Compatibility has improved too. While older models were picky about mug materials and sizes, newer ones work with various materials - ceramic, glass, metal, you name it. Just make sure your mug has a flat bottom for optimal heat transfer.

Battery life has come a long way as well. Some portable models can now last several hours on a single charge, perfect for long workdays or travel. The charging time has decreased significantly too.

From my experience, these new features aren't just gimmicks - they actually make a difference in daily use. No more rushing to finish my coffee before it gets cold, or dealing with inconsistent temperatures. It's pretty amazing how such a simple device can make such a big difference in your daily routine.

Remember though, even with all these features, it's important to regularly clean your warmer and follow the manufacturer's guidelines. This will help ensure it lasts longer and continues working effectively.",1,1759626482.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nyax6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nyax6n/what_size_bread_maker_fits_best_in_a_small/,What size bread maker fits best in a small apartment kitchen?,"Hey everyone! I've been living in a tiny apartment in the city for the past couple years, and I totally get the struggle of making the most of limited counter space. After months of craving fresh homemade bread but worrying about space, I finally took the plunge and got a bread maker. I wanted to share my experience to help others in the same boat.

After tons of research and measuring my precious counter space about a hundred times, I found that compact bread makers around 11-13 inches wide are perfect for small kitchens. They're big enough to make a decent 1-2 pound loaf but won't eat up your whole counter.

I eventually went with this awesome compact bread maker I found on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/bread-maker). It's been a total game-changer! The footprint is similar to a standard coffee maker, so it fits perfectly in that awkward corner that was just collecting junk before.

Here's what I've learned about choosing the right size:

- Measure your available counter space and leave a few inches for ventilation
- Consider vertical space too (some bread makers need room to open upward)
- Think about storage - will you keep it out or put it away?
- Look at loaf capacity - most compact models make 1-2 pound loaves
- Check the dimensions carefully - width is usually the biggest concern

The best part about modern compact bread makers is that they don't sacrifice features for size. Mine has all the essential settings - basic white, whole wheat, gluten-free, and even a jam setting! Plus, the smaller size actually helps it heat more evenly.

For anyone interested in the exact model I got, you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/bread-maker. It's seriously been worth every penny, and I love waking up to fresh bread without my kitchen feeling cramped.

Some bonus tips I've learned:
- Store flour and yeast in airtight containers to save cabinet space
- Use the delay timer to bake overnight (amazing morning smell!)
- Clean it right after use to avoid crusty buildup
- Keep the manual handy - bread making has a learning curve

Living in a small space doesn't mean you have to give up on fresh homemade bread. The right compact bread maker can fit perfectly in your kitchen while still delivering that amazing fresh-baked taste. I honestly can't imagine going back to store-bought bread now!

Let me know if you have any questions about specific measurements or features - I'd be happy to help!",1,1759626470.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nyauie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nyauie/aitah_for_not_talking_to_my_fathers_wife_after/,AITAH for not talking to my father's wife after our family's vacation?,"Hi ! first ever post here....  
English is not my first language so sorry in advance for any grammer mistakes...  
Sorry it's gonna be longgggg

I (26f) don't talk to my father's wife (53f) for almost 3 months, after a huge argument we had during our annual family trip.   
So... For context -  
My biological parents are divorced for most of my life, let's say around 23 years I think?  
I am the oldest, I have another biological bother (24m) and we are best friends (he is not a part of this story).  
Anyways... my parents divorce was hell on earth for me and my brother, but eventually both of my parents got married again and I definitely love that for them! they are living their best life right now, but it wasn't always like this....  
My father used to be a HUGE D\*\*\* to me and my brother, so most of my life I was not in contact with him because of this, had to live with my mother but it was not easy for me as a child as well, and found myself basically raising myself (my parents agree with that statement here.) and so I grew up very independent but very very people pleasing.  
but I LOVE them so much, I grew up a back bone and I talk to my father now for years. I have clear bounderies with him, and overall with everyone in my life. He also grew older, and changed a lot and he is definitely my second best friend and I trust him with my eyes closed:)  he is kind and gentle and sweet with me I finally feel like I have a real real father from the movies I used to watch! with my mom? everything is just fine, but she always wanted me to be things I am not. More girly and the ""perfect daughter"" whatever that means I bet you understand...-  BUT I am a tomboy, I like weightlifting, am a metalhead, ""am not skinny"" (she wish I was) I am size european 4 btw lol.  
She hates my career and school choises etc etc etc... endless... but we are on good terms as well. this all is relevant I swear lol  
  
BACK TO THE STORY  
My relationship with my father's wife, let's call her Y, wasn't great aither growing up. She once put my father in jail for something that turned out he never did, she just lied to the police to ""make a point"" because they had an argument or something?..  
And yes, she admitted the lies openly. It was terrible for me, this whole jail thing, but we went through that, you know? it's been more than 10 years. People grow and change.. and I feel like she is a great person overall. By the way, she has two kids from other two relationships she had before my father (they are 15 years together 10 married) her kids are quite distant from her I am still not sure why honestly....  
l live alone far from home due to my career and uni, and my brother as well. Everyone else from my entire family are still in my hometown. they have never left.  
So, when me and my brother visit we go stay at my mother's place because we each have a room there and basically grew up there. We just go visit my father during evening time for some chill and good loud af laughter and coffee and cake on the balcony.

Last year, me and my mother had a huge fight and we cut the contact for several months. the reason for the fight was because I had a huge personal trauma, and on top of that I decided to break up with my ex after dating for 2 years because he was ab\*\*\*\*\*\* (not physically but mentally) and my mother, who thinks women should obey men, gaslighted me and told my ex I cheated on him, that's why I'm breaking up with him. BUT IT WAS NOT THE CASE OBVIOUSLY LOL ! I felt so humiliated not just by him but also my own mother who should've wiped my tears instead of breaking my heart even more.  
That was it for me. that's why I said I grew up a backbone. I was always been gaslit by every person in my f\*\*\*\*ing life. I have had enough. I took a massive personality change on myself and cut ties with toxic friends, family members, co-workers all at once in a blink of an eye! that was it for me.   
So everytime I visited my hometown I went to my father's place and slept there on the couch. It was lovely. Whenever I came we had great times making food, cleaning, helping them around the house etc...I felt so welcomed. I used to seek advices from Y and she was very very sweet, she was not entertaining the fight i had with my mom (my father was lol) She was geniuenly sweet about that and very kind. I really really needed that and I appreciated that so much!

Y is very ""street smart"" I would say, she has been through sh\*t in her life. She also experience the same kind of relationship that I have with my mother, with HER mother!  
Y is so funny sometimes haha she tends to throw tentrums a lot and argue with almost everyone and everything! she has a huge mouth of a gangster but I always thought to myself that she is a boss b\*\*ch and loved that she knows how to stand up for herself. like, yes queen.   
Before that falling out with my mom, me and Y's relationship was great but quickly we became closer and closer. Long phone calls every now and again, laughter, going out for coffees, brunches, shopping... it went this way for a long time!  
She also used to seek for help from me whenever she had drama in the work place or with her rebelious daughter (17f, let's call her ""L"") or even with my father! I didn't mind that I love them and want them to be happy.  
Keep in mind that it was all new to us though. I only talk for my father in the last 4 years, so it's like getting to know his family for the first time maybe...

Last August, me, my dad, Y, and L went on a trip together. We were super excited about that. We did that before and it was so much fun.  
This year they changed their car to an electric one, It's 99% used by Y. my father has another regular car. They have never used it for driving outside of  our small town, always same road, same charging station. Especially long rides like we planned on doing (at least 7-8 hours of driving).  
Having an electric car means you need to plan the roadtrip to the destination according to charging stations, download several apps on your mobile and overall feel comfortable driving it to a far away place. I understood that and I don't even have and electric car. I asumed everything was just fine and that my dad and Y know exactly what they are doing, right? yeah. here things started to go wrong.   
  
The morning of the trip, my dad and I took their second car not electric, Y and L took the electric one. Just for the sake of comfort because last time was terrible.  
About 3-4 hours on the road, Y calls us screaming her lungs out because her battery was low and was sure she is going to stay stuck on the sideroad. My father was clueless because he usually drives his other car and just screamed as well out of cluelessness haha! I smiled and told L to open maps. I really have no idea why, they could not get along with that. I stayed calm told them it's fine and opened the maps for them to check for the closest charging station. I found one. meanwhile they figured out they lost us on the road and the station was too far away. We woke up with a great mood. the mood was off at this point. lots of screaming, yelling, whatever. And I am trying to help them now not just find a station, but to also find their way back. They found that station but not their way back to us.

I was fursturated because my sis L is a teenager and knows better than me how to use phones and maps, and also felts drained because I tried to calmly explain the road to Y but she didn't even listen she just went off on us for no reason like it was our fault or something. I asked my dad ""what the hell?..."" she knows this car better than anyone here. she uses it every single day like. what?  
Okay we all calmed down but I was drained and the vacation didnt even start! it was like that for the ENTIRE 5 days there. Fights, screamings, arguments... all because of that car.

On our last day, I was done. I found myself chasing my own tail for this car, standing in the sun (it was 60c) for the line to the chargers while she went to the mall. I downloaded app with my card, had to fight people for the line. I am not kidding I was seconds from ambulance just because it was soooo hot   
I was sweating my life out and came to her on our last day and calmly and asked her ""Y, why didn't you took care of that before hand? the apps, the road...""  
she was offended af !!! like a I just slapped her or something!!!! she just walked away.  
And on top of that, I got the attutide from her, she literally blamed that on me I was so done. It's just the tip of the iceberg of that week! all because of that freaking car !   
  
On our way back, we stopped for a brunch in a coffee house. My dad suggested I should talk to her because since that question I asked her, she ignored me the entire day.

Now... this is where I might be the AH. I told her ""I feel like I'm going above and beyond for your own car, trying to help you every chance I have, while you are in the mall and I am at the charging station out in the deadly sun. While you were asleep in bed I was roaming the streets in order to find an available station. I fought strangers for charging spots. I did an entire web research in order to use and charge the car right. Asked strangers for help, put my card in those charging apps, I don't need no ""thank you"" but this treatment is definitely not what I deserve! If you can't use this car why tf do you even own it? you should use the bike instead. you are irresponsible""  
She got up and left. Saying nothing as before! but did tell everybody in the family that Im an AH and they agreed with her.

Even my father felt the same about this as me, thought I was too harsh on her.  
I am a recovering people pleaser. I honestly felt good for saying what I felt ot her I didn't put my mind on it after that...  
Some time has passed and I was so chill about that. I visited them a week ago, in hopes that everybody are over this now as I am. but when she saw me from the balcony coming over, she took herself and left before I came. She doesn't want to see me anymore.   
Everyone tell me I shoulf apologize.... So, AITAH? ",1,1759626247.0,AITAH,10,0.67,False
