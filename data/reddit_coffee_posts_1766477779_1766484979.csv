1ptpri8,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1ptpri8/where_would_you_go_from_here/,Where would you go from here?,"I work full time in a union job for a major company with a 10 year pay scale. Year 10 is currently $45/hr, I’m at year 2 at $21/hr and I’m really struggling to see if I should stay or leave. The benefits are great and I love my job, but I’m struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Last year I brought in $35k after OT and taxes
My monthly expenses are
Rent (income restricted housing): $1,370
Gas: ~$250
Groceries: ~$250
Debt payments: $500
Car ins: $120
Utilities: ~$100
Spotify: $10
Medication: $55
Laundry: $50

This leaves me with roughly $100 at the end of the month but there’s always something SOMETHING that throws me in red every month. A parking ticket, an oil change, fridge went out and all my food spoiled, etc…

I live in a studio and it’s definitely not luxury. It’s income restricted but because I’m technically at the higher end of the income limit, my portion is still $1,370/m. I drive a 10 year old car that’s making funky noises now. I cook EVERYTHING at home, if I’m eating out it’s on someone else’s dime lol. My grocery shopping is all raw ingredients, no frozen pizzas or anything. I haven’t been to a coffee shop in months, I make my coffee at home, buy the beans in bulk, grind them at home, and I use powdered milk as creamer. No car payment, no phone bill, no Netflix, no new phone, etc… I’m not doing all that stuff boomers claim is making me poor haha.

The debt is credit card debt. It started a couple years ago with a car repair and it’s been snowballing ever since. The payment goes up, it takes from my budget, and it’s a circle I’m trapped in. I called and asked them about settling and they wanted the money up front and I have nothing. 

It’s hard to sleep at night sometimes cause I wonder what’s gonna happen when my car doesn’t start one day or even if I got a flat tire. Jobs in my area all seem to pay like this so I think I might as well stay at a job with a guaranteed growth ladder and possible upward mobility, but oh my gawd, the accumulated debt is going to eat away any pay raises I get 😵‍💫. Advice?

I’m a guy in my early 20s and have found making friends of recent super hard. I’m really after some mates just to do basic stuff with every now and then like go to the beach, go to the gym, go watch a game etc etc. definitely am aware I’m coming across as desperate here but don’t have heaps of people I can immediately reach out to!

1ptpp6k,https://v.redd.it/x9652bqh9x8g1,The Calendar Marked a Day I Don’t Remember Living,"I keep a paper calendar on my kitchen wall.
Nothing fancy—just dates, grocery reminders, work shifts.
It helps me feel organized.

Yesterday, while circling an appointment, I noticed a day already crossed out.
A thick black X.
Hard enough to tear the paper slightly.

The date was last Tuesday.

I don’t remember doing that.

I flipped back through my phone.
No photos.
No texts.
No calls.
My step counter shows zero steps for that entire day.

At first I thought maybe I’d been sick.
Or slept through it.
But my bank app shows a transaction from that afternoon.
Coffee shop.
Across town.
A place I’ve never been to.

I went there today.

The barista looked up and smiled like she recognized me.
“You’re early,” she said.
Then she paused.
“…or late. I’m not sure anymore.”

I asked what she meant.
She glanced at the calendar behind the counter.
Every date except one was crossed out.

The same one as mine.

She leaned closer and lowered her voice.
“You came in last Tuesday and asked me to remind you,” she said.
“You said if I didn’t, you’d forget again.”

“Remind me of what?” I asked.

She hesitated.
Then slid a napkin across the counter.

Written on it, in my handwriting:

“Do not look at the calendar after this.”

When I got home, the X on my wall calendar was gone.
The paper was smooth again.
Untouched.

But today’s date is already crossed out.

After 20 years in this industry, I’ve realized 90% of this sub is people asking how to scale a business that has $0 in revenue.

I see threads daily about how ""hustle culture"" is toxic. Fair point. But the alternative isn't posting philosophical essays on Reddit about ""burnout"" from a business that doesn't exist yet. The alternative is building a boring service, charging money for it, and ignoring the noise.​

Stop optimizing your morning routine. Stop asking for feedback on your ""stealth startup"" that is just a ChatGPT wrapper. Go find a customer who is willing to open their wallet. If you can't do that, you don't have a business; you have an expensive hobby that requires a lot of coffee.​

1. Always threatened breaking up as a manipulation tactic when we tried to resolve things. He would always take all my stuff out and put it in the living room when we had our ""conversations"" which was me usually calmly talking to him and him taking 10 minutes for a response which consisted of anything he could think of to deflect any validation, acknowledgement, or resolution
2. He said I looked like a middle schooler, he said that if i got any skinner I would look anorexic, he said my ass looks good now with a tone of implying it didn’t before, he said if i gained weight it might look better. When I said that hurt my feelings he got mad and said I took it the wrong way
3. He called my friends trashy and said he didn’t care what they think after he was an ass around them. They said they didn't like his vibe because he was glaring at me behind my back and rushing me to take my turn in pool when I was just saying hi to them real quick. He said my school wasn’t “good enough” for him to get a masters from, and put me down many times covertly. He said everyone who works at restaurants is stupid anyways when my manager hurt my feelings and I work at a restaurant such as many other college students do. The average IQ of a server is 100 so really what he said is factually incorrect
4. He was always so grumpy when he drank. Irritable and mean.
5. When i told him i didn’t like my nose, he said he wouldn’t pay for a nose job, but didn’t say that it was pretty. When I was sad to notice the paintings from his ex (I saw them and thought they were pretty, so I asked who painted them, and I didn't expect him to get rid of them, but it just kinda hit me when he said that) all he said was I can't get rid of them and then he left the room. Even when I grabbed my chest and said oof that kinda made me feel weird, he didn't hug me and say it's okay or comfort me
6. He told me I should've left my physical abuser sooner when I told him about it all he said was “sounds like you should've left him sooner”
7. When we had our first argument and we were at top golf his coworker said “maybe \[boss\] will take you to a strip club” and he said I guess I would go for the experience. It upset me, but I was going to wait to talk about it later, but he just got up and left and said we were leaving. The reason he knew I was upset was because I just got all stiff and wasn't moving towards him when he leaned over for a hug but I was talking normal and being polite to his friends. On the way home he was mad and didn’t say anything. I went upstairs and cried for an hour and he left me up there alone til I came downstairs and he was like “I don’t wanna be that way I should listen and not be so defensive” then said in the same sentence “**are you even capable of having a healthy relationship**” he was still grumpy because later on I asked him if I was the most sexual person and he looked at me with anger and said “thats subjective” I found that to be critical
8. I asked him if he wished I had bigger boobs and he said no comment
9. I don’t like swallowing and he said a few time “you wont even do that” trying to make me feel bad or inadequate and when I asked about it he said well I know you have done it before so
10. He came to my work with \[his best friend\] and was an asshole to me and almost made me cry. \[his best friend\] put his hand in his face and shook his head because it was so embarrassing for someone to treat their girlfriend like that
11. One time I went to his house when he got back from \[a city 2 hours away where he spends 2 days a week\] and I was really anxious that day but he didn’t care and he asked for a blow job
12. The second time we fought we were at a sushi restaurant. We were trying to figure out how to order a fork on the ziosk thing, I tried, then he did, but then I realized what to do so I was like “oh its this” and I reach over to touch it and he was like “stop” in a mean tone. And I was like don’t use that tone with me. I didn’t think it was a huge deal but he sulked the rest of the dinner and on the ride home. I was like why are you so mad, and he said “you said I used a tone and I didn’t think I did” I said it doesnt have to be a huge deal but you are making that. You say you didn’t mean it and I believe you lets move on. Really, a partner shouldn’t be so quick to be annoyed, second he should be like “oh I am sorry baby I didn't mean it like that” you know, like care about my feelings? Basic stuff. I remember him asking, “is this going to happen every day?”. BTW I did the math and we argued 4% of the time. At least til this point. I was mostly quiet about these things. I took the days I had an argument with him and the days I didn't and compared them.
13. At the beach I told him that I am insecure about my face and chin. I also told him at \[local coffee shop\] another day. He said my chin was like Reese Witherspoon. At the time I didn’’t see it as a disguised insult, then one day I remembered the Reese Witherspoon Family Guy episode of her using her chin to carve a door. We were talking about his dog being weird looking and cute, then I jokingly asked if I was weird looking and cute. He said “hm, yeah, I think its your head, its big, oh and your chin too” I said that's not a joke I told you I was insecure about that. He said “aw youre not mad are you? I was just joking. I remember you saying something about it one time. Later on he said he didn’t remember though.
14. At the beach we were having fun, he started drinking so he started being grumpy. He was holding me in the water and I said isn’t this fun! are u having fun? And he said no or not really or something. Then I asked why and he said “because you don’t let me sleep” Which I said oh… Im sorry. I feel like I don't really keep you up but you just stay up with me in the living room. But I'm sorry we can work on that. I was sad and got out of the water. He suggested taking a break in the RV and so we did. I was trying to not fight because we were drinking. He asked if I was okay and I said I'm fine. I was upset because that was the moment I realized that he wasn’t going to change, that he's grumpy when he drinks and doesn’t care about me. I told him I don’t want to drink with him before that or something along those lines, but I wasn't firm and he started drinking first that day. I ended up drinking way too much because I didn’t give a shit, I was angry, and I embarrassed myself.
15. One time I sent a letter I carefully wrote to be nice about how I feel I can’t communicate with him and how I feel emotionally alone. He got upset and told his mom which I told him not to do because that creates issues. He made it seem to his mom like the letter was all about me saying he didn’t compliment me enough I think because later on he said “my mom thinks your insecure, you remind me of my ex and that worries me” The letter was extrememly kind and I said ""I know you don't mean to do this and I am sorry if I am just being sensitive. I dont want to be too much"" Like, it was so nice. at thend I was like btw can you compliment me when we go out on dates if I dress up. I said that as an aside point. I think he told his mom that was what the whole things was about. I thought a letter would be better communication than in person because it never went well in person even though I tried to be so tactful about constructive conversations.
16. When we saw each other again after I sent the letter, we went out to eat and he drank again. My boundaries weren’t firm on this yet. I remember saying that he's so pretty and I wouldn’t find someone else like him. He said “don’t scare me away then” I said, what does that mean? He said you sent that letter when I was on vacation and it upset me. I said, ""Maybe I should have waited but it was hard for me to send and I haven’t been able to sleep. I made it as nice as I possibly could."" I then decided I wasn’t going to drink because he picked a fight and I don’t want to be drunk and fighting. We went to his house and I almost went home but he said to talk. As we talked, he watched football while never saying sorry for one thing. Three hours we talked, it was a long time. This is when he said “you scare me because you remind me of my ex, my mom thinks you're insecure, the fact you want your friend to be there for you right now is irrational and crazy because she has a lot going on now” earlier I had told him i was sad because i feel like i really needed her and she wasn’t able to be there which i understood i was just being sad about it.
17. I remember at the beginning of our relationship I messed my hair up by bleaching so it was real fluffy and I was insecure about it and I said a few things about it like that he wouldn’t wanna see me because it was messed up. He was like “it's fiiiine” and i said something like that i was insecure again and he said “stop”... so i stopped. Me needing reassurance annoyed him so bad for some reason. Like at the haunted house he didn’t compliment me that night at all and I got all dressed up and I asked him if I was a 10/10 trying to get him to say something nice and he was all annoyed about it and said “yes” really sternly and rolled his eyes.
18. When we played pickleball he went hard on me because he wanted to win and I wasn’t good yet and it made it not a good time. I didn’t want to do it anymore. I don't expect him to go easy on me but intentionally hitting it really hard to where I can’t get it when I am not that good and I’m ten points behind because he keeps doing it is just frustrating.
19. I love thrifting and I always wanted him to go with me but he never wanted to, I got him to go twice and he was like this isn’t going to take too long I don’t wanna be here forever. He wouldn’t engage with me very well and I just wanted to hang out and have fun. I would look at stuff really fast because I just felt uncomfortable and he seemed annoyed.
20. When we played mini golf I was talking while he was swinging and he told me to shut up. Another time I didn't know his mom was talking to him and I was trying to fix his shirt, and tried to say something and he shushed me. I didn't know she was talking because she was in another room and he was leaned in to it halfway to listen, the door was mostly closed so I couldn't hear it. He said sorry for shushing me and I said I was scared that I was going to be treated badly again and I wouldn’t have it in me to leave. 
21. He was very grumpy when driving like he had road rage and it made me uncomfortable and when he set up his TV he got frustrated so fast that it scared me. But after that we got ready and we went to this burger place. He was still grumpy and it was so unpleasant to be around. 
22. When we talked about stuff it was hard and I started having panic attacks because he was always so hostile. Bringing out my clothes and saying mean things. Anyone who purposefully goes out of their way to make you cry when you haven't wronged them, and then watches you cry instead of soothing you, does not love you. They might say they do, and they might think they do, and they might even act like they do, but they don't because that's not what emotionally healthy people do to people they love. That's abuse. Abusers can say and feel sorry in a moment, but when they are angry they do it again.
23. One time he drank before a date and I was already feeling anxious that day and he knew I didn’t like it, but he asked me and I said I can’t tell you what to do. On the date he got a drink and there wasn’t anything left in it but water and I tried to sip the remnants of the drink to try it, but it was just melted ice at the bottom (about an inch) He says when he comes back “did you drink the rest of my drink?” I said I was going to try to get some but it was all melted ice, water at the bottom. He was like I’m just kidding, it's fine. We got a dessert and he ate most of it because I eat slow and it was a medium sized cannoli. I moved the plate because he leaned over the table to grab the book. We weren’t touching the dessert anymore really and it was almost all gone, only a bite of cream was left. He said “Wow, you're just gonna move it out of my way like that?” as if i was moving it to take it or be aggressive or something. I was just moving it so he could grab the book without getting cream on his arm
24. Earlier that evening, on the previously mentioned date, there were people standing in the parking lot keeping him from parking. They weren’t there that long. They were saying bye to each other. And he gets so mad and keeps creeping forward and gets kind of close to them in his truck. He gets mad like “these people are idiots” but really it had been a couple seconds. I was alarmed at how fast he got angry and then it made me uncomfortable that he got so close to them to try to get them to move. I said it’s fine, just to wait. And when we got out I was like please don’t be grumpy, then the drink and desert thing happened. I remember when we started dating he told me that his red flag is that sometimes he gets aggressive when he drinks, but he said never physically. And he never hurt me physically or grabbed me in any aggressive way. This was when he chugged like 4 beers before we left one time. He asked if it was okay if he had some beer and I said, ""you know I don't like it but I can't tell you what to do.""
25. One time I got honked at in the church parking lot and it annoyed me. I didn’t do anything crazy or honk back or anything, but I went to his house after and ranted a bit. He says ""well maybe it was an accident"" which is annoying bc I knew it wasn't, but not that problematic. His dad overheard me ranting and a few days later right before I left for school he said “oh yeah - I wanted to tell you something that was weird of my dad, he said you were being overdramatic and then walked away awkwardly.” (Why the hell do you feel the need to tell me that right before I leave for school out of nowhere?) I said I was just ranting, that's valid for me to do if I am annoyed about something.” Later another day I tried to talk to him about how his drinking and grumpy behavior was bothering me. After a non meaningful “im sorry” with an annoyed glare opposite of my direction, I said ""no you aren't can you say it like you mean it and tell me why?"" He goes silent other than saying he wants to go home. The ride to his home from mine was quiet and awkward. We get back and I say “I can see you are upset and this isn’t going to go well so I am going to leave \[in my car\] and hopefully we can talk about it tomorrow and you can actually apologize” I said calmly albeit upset as I grab my purse and walk out the door. I was firm but more as a matter of fact. He follows me out ""you're just going to leave?” I said yes, we can talk about it tomorrow I can tell this isn’t going to go well. He says ""no lets talk."" I am now sitting in my car and I say “okay, well, fine. So at the beach when I had told you the dinking bothers me you chose to drink and I let it go, but in the water I asked if you were having a good time and were happy as you were holding me and the sunset was going down and i was happy- and you said all grumpy ‘no.’ I asked why, ‘because you don't let me sleep’. I said oh… sorry. And that's when I was so upset and I ended up drinking too much because I was really sad and I didn’t care. And on our date to \[cannoli restaurant\] you were so mad at those people in the parking lot so fast, like they were about to move and -” He cuts me off and says like an asshole “well my dad was right. You are overdramatic” I just said ‘okay, bye’ and backed out and left
26. The next day he said to come over so we could talk. He pulled out all my clothes again and put them on the floor like he was going to break up with me like he did every time. I started the conversation about the drinking and I began explaining the beach thing and the \[cannoli restaurant\] thing and the haunted house thing and work thing (when we was mean to me at my work he was drinking). He just doesn't say anything, all these conversations went the same way. He’d pull my clothes out and just sit there and be silent. I think he just sat there for like 10-15 minutes and I waited on him to say something and all he says is “why do you say you think my parents are judgmental” I said because the beach thing happened and they don’t know how you have been treating me and what happened and I see the way your mom looked at \[his brothers gf\]  when they were talking about people drinking too much. I've heard your mom say a lot of stuff about people behind their backs and I have also seen the message she wrote to her dad after he said “good job \[his name\], she's gorgeous”. She said, “\[I\]I was really made up in that picture, but \[I\] am cute though. And \[my\] hair is really long and dry.” Why was that necessary and then your dad saying I am dramatic for ranting about being honked at for no reason. He said “I tried to defend you, I just won't tell you anything anymore” I said no you didn’t, he just walked away. All you said to him was ""what do you want me to say?"" He said well it was my intention to defend you. I said “what if there is tension between me and them, would you defend me?” He doesn’t say anything and just sits there for like another eternity. He says “well, I feel unappreciated” What the actual fuck did that have to do with anything we were talking about. Nothing was resolved. I asked why he felt that anyway and he said he could be in \[the city\] and he has friends there and stuff \[he rlly doesnt\] but he drives to see me. I told him all the time how I felt about him driving here. That I appreciated it, that I was proud of him. I always said thank you for feeding me. I can count on one or two fingers the amount of times he said he was proud of me. I can count on one hand the amount of times he's said something positive about my hobbies. I said “you don’t think I feel the same way? I could be at home with my birds who are in their cages all day or doing \[hobby\] or playing piano but I am here to spend time with you.” It ended after I said ""Why are you making the conversation about this? It isn’t what we were talking about."" Nothing happened after that. Silence and I took a sad nap and he didn’t wake me up to go get pumpkins like I had asked to do. He called me passive-aggressive for telling him that it was lame he hadn’t written the letter or note of 10 things he loved about me. I told him that because he told his counselor everything was fine when it wasn’t. It had been about a month that had gone by of me waiting for him to do that. I wrote him 21 things three days after I was asked to do the exercise. That's why I was mad about the birthday presents he got me when I told him two things I really wanted (a candle and a necklace) which he didn't get. He just ordered stuff on Amazon, I knew he didn’t really care.
27. About the birthday presents. I reacted wrong because I could never bring anything up, so it came out in ways that were not correlated to the major issue. Not feeling cared about. Not feeling listened to. By complaining about the presents, it was more so the issue of not feeling cared about enough to go across the street to TJ Maxx and get a candle there. I know I was wrong to act that way, but it is why. He said that night in response that he is used to dating people that are more covered up. That don’t show their body, but I don't post bikini pictures and stuff like he makes it out to be. But really, he just said that to be mean. The audacity to act like that and watch porn is so ironic. He even said he would be jealous if I watched porn and he wasn't okay with me doing that.
28. The first photoshoot I had when we were dating (I am an artist so I do them sometimes) he made me cry because he didn’t like it, but he should have talked to me about it before or after, and maybe I could’ve brought him or something like we could have fixed it. He was in \[the city\] and I had anxiety about it because I did care what he thought and felt, and I sent him a voice memo where I was like almost crying and saying I care and we would talk about it later. I tried not to cry all day. Shouldn't he have been proud of me? When it was over and \[me and the three other people on the shoot\] were all eating he apologized and said he was overreacting. I understand why it was upsetting, but making me cry wasn’t cool. He should be proud of me and tell me I look pretty or something.
29. One time I had this dream that he had cheated on me like he was entertaining other women and touching them in the dream. I went over to his house before work because I worked an hour later than I thought I did. I told him and he got defensive and said with this annoyed look on his face after me asking him to tell me and reassure me he finally said ""I wouldn't do that” and I said again I know but it still hurts though, can you say something reassuring. He says sarcastically, “yes you are the most attractive woman on the earth - no in the universe. The only one that exsists” I said that sounded sarcastic. Why are you saying it like that, why are you so defensive? He said, “because you are accusing me of doing something” I said, “no I’m not I literally said you wouldn't do that and that it just bothered me.” He said, “I have dreams too and I don’t tell you because I know you wouldn’t” or something like that. It reminds me of the time he said he “was upset too now” after I confronted him about the porn on his phone. Then he said he doesn’t want to hear about it because I post myself half naked as if that is equitable or even my intention, to lie. Also, I dont even do that first of all, he just doesn't like my photoshoot pictures where I am fully clothed but wear shorts and a tank top. One time he had a dream that I broke up with him. He said it woke him up in the middle of the night and he told me it made him really sad. I comforted him because it was natural to do, the kind thing to do. But when it came to me, he was hostile. Probably because he knew he was doing something and hiding it behind my back and didn’t want to be confronted about it.
30. He almost never acknowledged how awful he was except for one time before I went to work when I said you hurt me on purpose. He said “disregard everything I said and that I didn’t deserve it.” Just expecting me to be normal after all of these things. He said sorry about the drinking conversation before church one time. I find it ironic \[lady who divorced her husband for his defensiveness after 23 years\] walked past and waved at that time.  
31. One time he said \[my school\] wasn’t good enough for him, that he wanted to get his masters from a better school. He talked down about it sometimes. One time I was mad because someone was mean to me at work like one of my managers and he said that everyone who works at a restaurant is dumb anyways and that was hurtful because a lot of servers are in school and they aren’t all dumb.
32. When I told him I was depressed he asked me about it later that day and the day after that. I was still depressed for weeks, but he didn’t ask about it anymore.
33. On national girlfriend day he didn’t say I was a good girlfriend, but instead brought sex toys that hurt and ultimately ripped me and made me bleed - he said felt sorry though. I had to ask him to say if I was a good girlfriend.
34. One time I was sexually harassed at McDonalds. I was wearing shorts and my fluffy jacket. I was scared and went to his house when I left. I was crying and he tried to comfort me, but then I initiated sex and he came after 30 seconds and left and went into another room and laid on the couch leaving me alone in the original room. He didn’t touch me after. 
35. He lied to me our whole relationship after I told him that porn isn’t compatible with me in a relationship (idc if I am not dating them though) and it hurts me very much if my partner does that while we are dating because I was sexually abused as a child. I told him the first time I went to his house, he didn’t listen. I said I will break up with you because I can't handle it, it hurts too much. He looked up stuff about chubby women, women bending over, engorged breasts. Other weird stuff, I didn't even look through all of it, that's just what I saw at first glance before I confronted him about it. He said I didn’t make it clear that it would make me break up, but I did; he just didn’t think I actually would and didn’t care. He thought I was too attached to do it. I am very small and skinny so it really hurt that it was those categories. Nothing wrong with it, I wish I could gain weight, but I can't. In the context of how I look and our relationship is why it was hurtful.
36. One time he worked at my house (remote job) and I wanted to cuddle on the couch after he got off, we sat on the couch then we moved into the bedroom and had sex. But I didn’t really want to, I wanted physical affection. I told him that after and he tried to say lets cuddle now then, but then I didn’t want to because it was too hot. We went out to eat at \[restaurant\] and I felt like he was grumpy because I ordered the cheesecake but I didn’t know that it was ten dollars, I said sorry I didn't know. He lets small things put him in a bad mood. It kind of ruined the outing.
37. We went to the mall one of the last times we did something. He got three cookies and I took a small bite like a pinch out of one. He was grumpy about that and he said to ask next time and got onto me about it. Why does it matter? I didn’t eat a whole one, nowhere near, and you had three. When we got back, I saw his mom grab the bag and say “oh nice, cookies!” I peeked my head into the door and said “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” she asked why and I said, “because I took a small bite of one and he got onto me about it.” It reminds me how at the beginning of the relationship he would get these Hershey bars out and never ask if I wanted any. I remember pointing it out. He stopped being so selfish about that, but like everything in this relationship, it's too little too late.
38. When I broke up with him I was so angry. He responded by saying ""don't do anything stupid” hinting at the fact he thought I wasn’t serious about it and would do something to make him angry because I was. He said he “didn’t want to hear it because I post half naked videos on the internet” as if my intentions in what I do and post line up with his virtual cheating. As if I am the kind of person to threaten breaking up let alone actually do it and come back. I am not. I told him I wasn’t happy already, and now my trust was broken. I couldn’t stay.
39. He said, “don’t talk shit about me to other people and I won't talk shit about you.” It isn’t my fault if the facts of the situation make you look like shit. That's on you. I just say what happened. I never said anything bad about him to my parents until we broke up, my family either. I kept a lot of it from \[best friend\] to protect him and everything from my other friends too. I am not contributing to my self-isolation anymore.
40. He said all men fantasize about other women in relationships, but they stop themselves from doing anything. That isn’t true. He genuinely does not believe there is any other way a man can be loyal mentally and physically. I thank God I have a good dad and a good family with loyal men and have never heard them say anything that would indicate otherwise. I asked my dad if it was true. He said it is not. He has a messed-up perception of women. He lied to get my consent to date me and be with me under false pretenses and I feel very violated. He is really not who he portrayed himself to me as.
41. He said I reminded him of his ex for insecurity but also ‘being mad’ at him a lot. I see why she was and I think patient and compassionate love is lost on him. Like he would get annoyed at nothing. The first time we went to cheesecake factory he looked mad randomly and I was like “u okay?” and he said “I just don't know what to say all the time” As if I expected him to talk a lot or something, which I didn’t. And told him it was cute when he didn’t know what to say on top of that.",3,1766481626.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I used to think the NZ accent wasn’t that crazy because of him, but it turns out that might be just because he’s lived in the US so long.

I recently came across videos from Will O’Connor, a running coach from NZ, and started checking out local track races with local announcers to follow Sam Ruths and Sam Tanner, and, oh man, their accents are nuts!!! I sadly don’t have enough vocabulary to describe it, but that’s the coolest shit I’ve ever heard. It’s a shame there are few English learners that try to master NZ accents compared to American or British ones.

By the way, shout out to athletes in NZ. Their middle/long distance scene is absolutely bonkers. If you’re Kiwi, you gotta tap in and give them their flowers for real!!",0,1766481606.0,EnglishLearning,4,0.5,False
1ptpmef,https://i.redd.it/dbt0j8w88x8g1.jpeg,Hyderabad to Bangalore Solo Ride on TVS Ronin,"Vehicle: TVS Ronin (Midnight Blue)

Route: NH 44 (603 KM)

Rider Status: Solo

**1. The Journey Log (Detailed Breakdown)**

**Leg 1: The Departure & The Luggage Crisis (06:15 AM – 08:00 AM)**

* **The Start:** I hit the road at 06:15 AM, but the beginning was stressful. My tail bag was tied with a rope that wasn't tight enough.
* **The Struggle:** Within 10 minutes, the luggage started slipping. I stopped to retighten it, but it remained unstable. I rode like this for nearly **25 km** until I crossed RGIA (Shamshabad), constantly worried the bag would fall.
* **The Life Hack Solution:** Before hitting the main highway, I made a decisive change. I untied the bag and wore it on my shoulders—but with a twist. I rested the base of the bag on the pillion seat so my shoulders carried zero weight; I was simply balancing it.
   * *Result:* The tension vanished. I could finally ride peacefully.
* **Breakfast Stop (Jadcherla - 07:55 AM):** Stopped to eat the breakfast Mom had packed. Total rest time: 30 minutes.

**Leg 2: The Brotherhood & The Solo Decision (Jadcherla – Kurnool)**

* **The Ronin Moment:** While riding through Telangana, I spotted another rider on the **TVS Ronin Top Model (Nimbus Grey)**. I waved, and he waved back with a genuine smile. That simple connection with a stranger made me incredibly happy.
* **Riding Dynamics:** I met a few other biker groups on the road. I tried riding with them, but some were too slow and others too reckless. I decided to send it and ride at my own pace, which felt much safer.
* **Kurnool Stop (10:00 AM):** Reached Kurnool and took a 45-minute break.
   * *Refuel:* Ate an apple and called friends/family to update them.

**Leg 3: The Wild West (Entering Andhra Pradesh)**

* **State Change Observations:** Crossing into Andhra Pradesh, the experience dipped.
   * **Traffic Sense:** Encountered many vehicles driving on the wrong side.
   * **Hazards:** There were cattle and animals roaming directly on the highway.
   * **Road Quality:** The tarmac had frequent rough patches, unlike the smooth roads in Telangana.
   * **The Wind Tunnel:** I noticed significantly higher crosswinds here. My theory: AP has far fewer trees lining the highway compared to Telangana/Karnataka, leaving the road exposed to open wind gusts.

**Leg 4: The Major Pitstop (Anantapur - 12:30 PM)**

* **Arrival:** Reached Anantapur around 12:30 PM.
* **Lunch:** The bike and I both had lunch.
   * I was starving, so I ordered **Paneer Biryani**. I ate half there and packed the other half for dinner.
   * Drank a strong coffee to prevent post-lunch drowsiness.
* **Rest:** Rested for a full hour. Left Anantapur at **01:50 PM**.
* **Sightseeing:** The **Kia Motors Factory** and the surrounding **windmill farms** were impressive and good to watch as I rode past.

**Leg 5: The Battle with Boredom (Anantapur – Chikkaballapur)**

* **The Monotony:** This was the most mentally draining part. The road was straight, the scenery didn't change, and it was incredibly boring.
* **Fighting White Line Fever:** To keep myself sane, I forced myself to stop. I pulled into **three different fuel stations** under the pretext of checking my tyre air pressure just to wake up my brain.

**Leg 6: The Detour & The Recovery (Yelahanka)**

* **The Detour:** I took a diversion near Yelahanka to meet my younger cousin near his college.
* **The Health Scare:** While parking the bike, I suddenly felt a headache and lightheadedness. It was likely a mix of dehydration and a sugar crash.
* **The Fix:** We went for a **sweet cold coffee**. It worked like magic—the headache faded, and I felt energized again.

**Leg 7: The Final Grind (Bangalore Entry)**

* **The Traffic Reality:** The Bangalore Welcome was real. It took me **90 minutes** to cover just **33 km**.
* **Battery Management:** It wasn't magic, it was management. I charged the phone for 20 minutes during lunch and used the bike’s USB port for a quick 15% boost mid-ride. The phone switched off exactly **200 meters** from my final destination—perfect timing as I already knew the local streets.

**2. Crucial Tips for Fellow Riders**

* **Day vs. Night Riding (Why Day is Superior):**
   * **Visibility:** In daylight, you can spot dangerous obstacles like cattle, potholes, and oil spills from a distance.
   * **The Invisible Vehicles:** Indian highways are filled with tractors and trucks that have no tail lights or reflectors. At night, these are invisible death traps; in the day, you can see them clearly.
   * **Being Seen:** It is easier for fast-moving cars to spot a motorcycle in daylight than at night.
* **The Orbit Hack (Focus Strategy):**
   * I carried a pack of Orbit gum and made it a rule to **chew 2 pieces at every stop**. The constant chewing action helps keep the brain alert, reduces stress, and prevents dry mouth on long stretches.
* **The Bug Menace:**
   * High-speed riding turns insects into bullets. They will plaster your headlight, jacket, and visor.
   * **Rule:** A **full-face helmet** is mandatory. Without it, a bug hitting your eye at 80 km/h could cause a serious accident.
   * **Kit:** Carry wet wipes or a microfiber cloth to clean your visor at every stop.
* **Health & Nutrition:**
   * **Sugar Drop:** If you feel dizzy or get a headache (like I did near Yelahanka), don't push through. Stop and drink something sweet immediately.
   * **Boredom Management:** On boring stretches, force yourself to stop every hour. Even a fake air check stop helps reset your attention span.
* **The Saturday Strategy:** I specifically chose to ride on a Saturday so I would have Sunday to recover. This allowed me to wake up late the next day with no guilt.

**3. Rider Insights (Technical)**

* **Crosswinds:** Felt stronger at high speeds because of Relative Wind Velocity (Bike Speed + Wind Speed) and the aerodynamic side-force that increases with speed.
* **White Line Fever:** The boredom I felt near Chikkaballapur was the early stage of highway hypnosis. The rhythmic white lines and engine drone lull the brain into a trance. My random stops were the perfect counter-measure.

**4. Post-Ride Recovery & Maintenance**

* **Physical Recovery:**
   * I felt slight lower back pain and general exhaustion upon arrival.
   * **The Cure:** A proper dinner (the packed Biryani), sugar desserts, and a long sleep.
   * **Result:** Woke up late Sunday morning feeling completely fine with **no pain**.
* **Maintenance Checklist:**
   * **Chain Care:** Clean and lube the chain immediately (highway riding dries it out).
   * **Bug Removal:** Soak a wet cloth on the headlight/visor for 5 mins to wipe bugs off without scratching.

**5. Trip Statistics**

* **Total Time:** 13 Hours
* **Travel Time:** 9 Hours
* **Rest Time:** 4 Hours
* **Distance Travelled:** 603 KM
* **Top Speed:** 127 Kmph

1ptpm01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1ptpm01/health_anxiety_and_cardiovascular_worries/,Health anxiety and cardiovascular worries,"Since September I have been struggling from anxiety and panic attack disorders due to marijuana abuse (hhc carts especially). 

One evening I had this kind of strange heart pumps which feels very strange, like my heart pumps more blood than usual and it makes it for like 2-3 times. Guys, this made me get in panic attack for 2 hours, my blood pressure went 160/80 and this made me even more anxious.

Since then I live in constant anxiety, worrying about my health. I went to the cardiologist and endocrinologist. I have never been healthier. So my personal doctor sent me to psychiatrist and she prescribed me Flupentixol/Melitracene pills (Deanxit). I’ve taken them for a month, they helped, however they seem not to anymore. The anxiety just does not disappear and as a result of which I have days which my breathing is very hard, I feel my lungs stiff and it’s like I am hungry for air. Trying to take a deep breath makes the thing with my heart happen and my panic just loops. 

I hope there are doctors here to explain why this happens. I’ve read the whole internet for this kind of heart behaviour and it seems to be something normal when I try to take deep breath the heart to pump additional blood due to the amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide in it. Like I don’t get it but when this happens I think that I am having a heart attack. I start checking my pulse and if I cannot feel it I start feeling dizziness which puts me in anxiety attack… Like this is on daily basis… And no, I don’t seek medical help in Reddit because that is cringe. I am healthy.

Mind that I am 21, I gave up smoking, do not smoke cigarettes, I stopped drinking coffee and stopped taking caffeine at all, I started eating healthier and cleaner food, stopped eating salt, because of the hight blood pressure. I am trying to move more

1ptpk5a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptpk5a,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)
The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie
The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket
The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants
The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

1ptpdig,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptpdig,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)
The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie
The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket
The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants
The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

When I or my siblings end up buying the thing that's when she also buys it. For example, there was no tomato paste in the fridge for a long time. My sister bought a can. The next day my mother bought a can too. Another example, there was no sugar so I bought some because I was craving a specific dish. Today I found the sugar jar full to the brim after being empty for weeks.

I should be focusing on bigger things in my life but she's dragging me to her level with this pettiness and I'm so tired. 

I wish I could wake up one day and to find out she died in the night. I wish I could live somewhere else. I can't yet so if you've read this far, please don't suggest it.",8,1766480410.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False
1ptpaed,https://i.redd.it/us0eq6hj4x8g1.png,Loving a Man Who Still Loves Her,"I’m trapped in a marriage where I’m invisible—compared to his ex Sienna, erased by his family and I still pretend that I 'm fine.

In the family dinner, they sat me next to Mom and put Sienna next to my husband Jace in my usual seat. Dad said he and Sienna are ""unstoppable."" Mom basically said she imagined him having kids with her.

Fleeing the suffocating family dinner table, I pushed open the door to the library. The photos on the piano were exactly where they always were.

There was my husband Jace at some college formal, Sienna stood beside him in a shimmering silver dress.

Another frame: Jace and Sienna on a ski trip, his arm slung around her neck.

Another: some charity ball, the two of them dressed to perfection, his eyes crinkled as he looked down at her.

There were photos of every family memers-but none of me.

Not one.

I'd been married to their son for two years. But here, in the room that held what they valued enough to frame, I didn't exist.

My grip on the frame tightened.

I feel like a placeholder, a footnote in their story any time she's in the room.

I am not the favorite here. And I am so, so tired of acting like that's okay.

——————

I knew she was beautiful before I even turned around.

It wasn't the way the room went quiet-Lane parties are never quiet. It was the way the noise shifted. The clink of crystal softened, the polite laughter tilted higher, and my mother-in-law's voice rose like someone had just laid a crown at her feet.

""Oh my God, look who's here,"" Helen Lane gasped. ""Jace, sweetheart, you didn't tell me she was coming.""

I was standing at the bar in the Lane ballroom, pretending to care about whether the champagne was too dry. Tonight was supposed to be about us. About me and Jace. Our second wedding anniversary, hosted by his parents because ""appearance is everything, darling.""

I smoothed my gold dress, pasted on the kind of smile that didn't touch my eyes, and turned.

And there she was.

Sienna Hart.

Even if I hadn't seen the photos-those perfect, filtered college memories that still lived in quiet corners of the internet-I would've known. There's a certain glow people have when they walk into a room that already belongs to them.

She wore a sleek, midnight-blue dress that dipped low in the back, her dark hair a sheet down her spine. Diamonds glittered at her ears like they were afraid not to. Her lips curled into an easy, practiced smile as she stepped into the warm light of the chandelier.

""It's been too long,"" she said, her voice low and smooth. ""You look amazing, Helen.""

Helen laughed, a high, delighted sound I had never once heard directed at me. ""You,"" she said, clutching Sienna's hands. ""You are a sight. Richard, look at her. Isn't she stunning?""

Richard Lane, my father-in-law, adjusted his cufflinks and nodded in approval. ""Mr. Hart must be proud to have such a successful daughter.""

Sienna tilted her head in modest acknowledgement. ""He tries,"" she said.

I stayed where I was for three beats. Four. The bartender glanced at me, then at the growing cluster of people around the door.

""Top off?"" he asked quietly.

I looked down and realized my flute was still half full. ""No,"" I said, my voice too bright. ""Thanks. I'm good.""

I was not good.

""Amara,"" Jace called, spotting me over Sienna's shoulder. His face lit up, like it always did when he found me in a crowd. Except tonight, there was another kind of light in his eyes-sharper, brighter, reflected from the woman standing beside him.

He crooked a finger. ""Come here, babe.""

I walked across the room, every step clicking on the marble like a countdown. In my head, I repeated the things I'd told myself all week: You are his wife. You belong here. You have the ring. You are enough.

By the time I reached them, the words felt thin and papery.

""Amara, this is Sienna,"" Jace said, slipping an arm around my waist. His hand rested just above the curve of my hip, familiar and possessive. ""Sienna Hart. We went to college together. She just agreed to partner with Lane Holdings on the Harborfront project.""

Of course she did.

Lane Holdings had been trying to land that project for months. It was all Jace talked about. The new waterfront development that would ""solidify the Lane legacy"" in the city. Late nights at the office, early mornings, endless phone calls.

I'd imagined faceless investors on the other end. I hadn't imagined her.

Sienna turned her gaze on me. Up close, her eyes were a warm hazel, flecked with green. Not cold, exactly. Just... assessing.

""So this is the famous wife,"" she said, lips curving. ""I've heard a lot about you.""

""Hopefully good things,"" I managed.

""All good,"" she said smoothly. ""You're even prettier in person.""

I should have thanked her. That would have been the polite thing to do. Instead, my brain snagged on the words famous wife. Famous to who? Jace's family? To their friends who still called him ""Golden Boy"" like we weren't all adults with mortgages now?

Jace squeezed my waist. ""Amara's been running this entire party,"" he said. ""My parents would be lost without her.""

""A party planner and a wife?"" Helen added with a laugh. ""She's very... useful.""

Useful.

I felt my smile tighten. ""Happy anniversary to us,"" I said, lifting my glass slightly.

""Two years,"" Jace said, ki-ssing my temple. ""Feels like yesterday.""

I wondered if it felt like yesterday to him because yesterday, and the day before that, and possibly every day before that, he'd already had practice imagining a future-with someone else.

Sienna's gaze flicked to the diamond on my finger, the one Jace had chosen. Round cut, simple band. Classic. The ring his mother said was ""appropriate.""

""Two years is impressive,"" Sienna said. ""In our circles, that's practically eternity.""

""She's exaggerating,"" Helen said, but she was glowing. Not at my marriage. At Sienna's presence. ""Come, come, we have to get a photo of you. Richard, call the photographer. We need a shot of you with Jace for the company Instagram.""

""With Jace,"" I repeated before I could stop myself. ""Is it not his anniversary party?""

Helen blinked, as if only just remembering. ""Oh, of course. One with all three of you, and then one of just Jace and Sienna for the Harborfront announcement. Business, darling. You understand.""

I understood that I was decoration. A matching accessory to the Lane name, gold dress catching the light just enough to prove my husband had taste.

""Sure,"" I said. ""Business.""

The photographer hurried over. ""Let's get the happy couple first,"" he said, positioning Jace and me in front of the floral arch I'd spent an entire afternoon arranging.

I turned toward my husband, letting the familiar angle of his jaw, the steady blue of his eyes, steady me. Whatever history he had with Sienna, whatever fantasy his parents had built in their heads, he was here.

With me.

He smiled down at me. ""Ready, Mrs. Lane?""

My heart kicked at the way he said it, the way he always said it. Like it still meant something to him.

""Always,"" I lied.

We posed. Flash. Flash. I tilted my head, hand on his chest, doing what I did best-looking like everything was fine.

""Perfect,"" the photographer said. ""Now, let's grab one of you and Ms. Hart for the project announcement.""

I stepped back automatically, but the way the photographer angled his body made it clear: I was no longer part of this frame.

Sienna joined him under the arch, blue dress a sharp strike against his black tux. They looked like a magazine cover. The Successful Exes. The Ones That Got Away.

""Just like old times,"" Sienna murmured as she slipped her hand lightly around his arm.

I was close enough to hear Jace's low laugh. ""Not exactly like old times,"" he said. ""I wasn't this rich back then.""

They laughed together, easy and familiar.

My stomach twisted.

""Mrs. Lane?""

I turned. It was a server, holding a silver tray of canapes. ""Crab cake?"" he offered.

I almost laughed at the absurdity-my husband and his first love framed in white roses behind me, my mother-in-law beaming like Christmas came early, me being offered tiny, perfectly plated bites like the room wasn't suddenly tilted.

""Sure,"" I said, picking one up so my hands wouldn't shake.

Flash. Flash.

The bulbs went off behind me, capturing a moment I already knew would be posted, framed, replayed.

""Beautiful,"" Helen sighed. ""You two look... timeless.""

My throat tightened. The crab cake tasted like nothing.

I turned away. The ballroom swam with glittering dresses and expensive cologne, the air thick with champagne and subtle judgment. Between the soft music and the murmur of voices, I heard it.

""They would have made such a perfect couple,"" someone whispered.

""I know. But he married that quiet girl instead. What's her name again?""

""I forget. She's sweet, though. Just... not Sienna.""

The crab cake turned to stone in my mouth. I set my plate down on the nearest table, suddenly queasy.

You are his wife, I reminded myself. You belong here.

But as I looked around, I realized something I hadn't let myself think before: I was the only one in this room who believed that.

""Amara.""

Jace's voice came from behind me. I took a breath and turned, face arranged into something neutral.

He stepped closer, smelling like cedar and expensive whiskey. ""You disappeared on me,"" he said lightly. ""You okay?""

""Just needed some air,"" I said. ""Your mom has me triple-checking everything.""

He laughed. ""You know how she is. She just wants tonight perfect.""

""Tonight is perfect,"" I said, the words tasting like glass. ""You have your project. Your family's happy. Sienna's here.""

He frowned. ""What's that supposed to mean?""

I opened my mouth, then closed it. If I said it the wrong way, I'd be dramatic. Jealous. Insecure. All the things women are called when they point out they're being pushed to the edges of their own lives.

""Nothing,"" I said finally. ""Congratulations on the partnership, by the way. Harborfront is huge.""

Something in his expression softened. He reached for my hand, thumb brushing my knuckles. ""We did it,"" he said. ""You and me. You supported me through all the late nights. I know I haven't been around as much, but... I see you, okay?""

For a second, I almost believed him.

Then Helen's voice cut through the moment.

""Jace!"" she called. ""Come, baby, the investors want a word! And bring Sienna!""

Not ""bring Amara."" Not ""bring your wife."" Bring Sienna.

His thumb stilled on my hand.

""I'll be right back,"" he said.

""You should go,"" I replied. ""Business.""

He hesitated, caught between me and them. The investors. His parents. His first love.

Then he ki-ssed my cheek, quick and distracted. ""I'll make it up to you later,"" he promised, already turning away.

I watched him walk back toward the arch, where Sienna waited under the flowers I had chosen, in front of the candles I had placed, in the glow of the lights I had checked twice.

It hit me in a slow, dull wave.

I'd built this entire night like a stage.

And somehow, I wasn't the star. I wasn't even the supporting actress.

I was the set.

A hand brushed my arm. I turned, expecting another server, another distant relative ready to ask me when I'd be giving the Lanes an heir.

Instead, it was Maya.

My sister stood there in her simple black dress, curls piled on top of her head, eyes sharp as always. ""You look like you're about to either faint or fight someone,"" she said. ""Which one is it?""

I exhaled, something shaky leaving my chest. ""I'm fine.""

She followed my gaze to where Jace and Sienna were laughing with the investors and our in-laws.

Maya's jaw tightened. ""I see.""

""Don't,"" I warned. ""Please. Not tonight.""

""Why not tonight?"" she demanded under her breath. ""Is there a better time to realize your husband's family is starring you in a play called 'You're Not Good Enough'?""

I swallowed hard. My eyes burned. ""If I make a scene, I'm the problem. You know that.""

Maya watched me for a long moment, her expression softening. ""You are the only one here not treating yourself like a placeholder,"" she said quietly. ""I need you to hear that.""

I shook my head, looking away before the tears could fall. ""I can't do this right now.""

She sighed. ""I'm not leaving, okay? I'm here. But I swear, if your mother-in-law opens her mouth one more time-""

""Amara,"" came Helen's voice, sharp as crystal breaking. ""We need you to fix the lighting near the dessert table. It's too dim for photos.""

Of course it was.

I wiped quickly under my eyes, forcing another smile. ""Coming,"" I called back.

Maya muttered something rude under her breath. ""Don't let them drain you dry,"" she whispered.

But that was the thing.

As I walked toward Helen, feeling my heart sink with every step, I realized they didn't have to try to drain me.

I was handing them the pieces myself.

The party lasted forever. Toasts were made. Speeches were given. Richard thanked Sienna by name for ""bringing fresh life and ideas"" to the company. When he thanked me, it was for ""making everything look so pretty.""

By the time the last guest left and the staff began clearing the tables, my cheeks ached from smiling.

""Successful night,"" Jace said, slipping an arm around me from behind as I stood near the empty dance floor.

""I guess,"" I said.

He ki-ssed the back of my neck. ""What's wrong?""

I almost said nothing.

Instead, I turned in his arms and looked up at him. ""Do you still love her?""

The question shocked even me.

Jace jerked slightly. ""Who?""

I didn't blink. ""Sienna.""

His jaw flexed. For a second, he looked like the boy I'd first fallen in love with in a crowded bar-eyes wary, shoulders tense, afraid of being seen too clearly.

""That's not fair,"" he said slowly. ""She was a big part of my life. We have history. But I married you.""

""That's not an answer,"" I said.

He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. ""Amara, this is exactly what I didn't want. Drama. You know how important this partnership is.""

""So you need her,"" I said. ""For business.""

His eyes flashed. ""I don't need anyone. I chose the best person for the job.""

""And for college,"" I added quietly. ""And for all the stories your parents tell about 'back when Jace and Sienna...'""

""Stop,"" he snapped. ""You're reading into things. You always do this.""

""Do what?"" My voice rose before I could stop it. ""Notice when your mother treats her like the real daughter-in-law? Notice when your dad says you would have been unstoppable if you'd married her? Notice that you light up in a way I haven't seen in months when she walks into a room?""

His face hardened. ""You're being ridiculous.""

""Am I?"" I asked. ""Because it feels like I'm competing in a game I didn't agree to play, against someone who already won.""

For a moment, neither of us spoke.

Then he said the one thing that would split me open.

""Maybe if you were more like Sienna, this wouldn't bother you so much.""

The silence after that was louder than any music.

Something inside me went very, very quiet.

I stepped back. His hand fell from my waist.

""Okay,"" I said, my voice almost calm. ""Then you should go celebrate your win with her.""

""Amara-""

""I'm going home.""

""You are home,"" he said, gesturing at the ballroom, at the mansion beyond it, at the life they'd handed me like it was a prize.

I looked around at the glittering room, at the arches and chandeliers and polished floors.

And for the first time, I let myself think, No. This is their home. Not mine.

""Our house,"" I corrected. ""On Willow Ridge. I'm tired.""

He exhaled in frustration. ""We'll talk about this tomorrow.""

""Sure,"" I said. ""Tomorrow.""

Tomorrow, when he'd calm down. Tomorrow, when he'd say I overreacted. Tomorrow, when I'd shove it all down again.

Unless I didn't.

The driver pulled up to the curb of our Willow Ridge house. Jace stayed behind to ""wrap up"" with his parents and the investors.

The hallway lights glowed warmly as I stepped inside. The framed wedding photo Helen insisted we take-me in white, Jace in gray, Sienna nowhere in sight-hung over the console table.

I stood in front of it for a long time.

We looked happy.

Maybe we were.

Once.

I reached up and straightened the frame. My hand shook. Instead of calming me, the small adjustment made something inside me snap.

Before I realized what I was doing, I lifted the frame off the nail and set it face down on the table.

The sound of glass gently touching wood felt like a decision.

Upstairs, in our bedroom, the dress came off, the makeup wiped away. I pulled on an oversized T-shirt and sat on the edge of the bed, my ring catching the lamplight.

I twisted it once. Twice.

Then I slid it off and placed it on the nightstand.

The indentation it left on my finger throbbed.

My phone buzzed. A text from Jace.

Jace: You left early. We'll talk in the morning. Don't overthink. I love you.

I stared at the words.

I love you.

My eyes burned. I typed, then erased, typed again.

In the end, I sent nothing.

I lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling. In the quiet of our home-the one I'd painted, furnished, cleaned, lived in-I heard my own voice, small but clear.

What if I stop trying to win?

I didn't know then that the first step to quitting a competition is simply... walking away.

I didn't know that leaving his parents' party early was the beginning of leaving his whole world.

I didn't know that in a few days, I'd walk into a coffee shop, hear my name in a voice I hadn't heard in years, and realize that my past wasn't as finished as I'd thought.

All I knew was this:

For the first time since I married Jace Lane, I took off my ring and didn't put it back on before I fell asleep.

Amara woke to the smell of coffee and something buttery drifting up the stairs.

For about five seconds, she forgot her life was a mess.

The sunlight spilled across the bed, soft and hazy, warming the empty side where Jace usually slept. The duvet was already smoothed on his half-he always did that in the mornings, a neat military tuck that looked like a hotel bed. It used to make her smile. Now, she just stared at it.

Her left hand lay palm-up on the sheet. Bare.

The ring glinted on the nightstand where she'd left it, a small circle of metal catching the morning light. The indentation on her finger, pale and tender, looked like a bruise.

Last night came back in pieces.

Sienna in midnight blue, slipping easily under the chandelier glow.

Helen's voice, delighted, high.

The photographer asking for ""just Jace and Sienna"" for the company page.

The video of Jace, younger and drunk, calling Sienna ""my always.""

Jace in the quiet ballroom, telling her, Maybe if you were more like Sienna...

A thickness rose in her throat.

""Happy anniversary to us,"" she muttered, pushing the covers back.

Her body felt heavy, like she'd danced all night in concrete shoes. She checked her phone mostly to avoid looking at the ring again.

Two unread messages from Maya.

Maya: Call me when you wake up. I'm still mad and I have speeches prepared.

Maya: Also, if you want to fake your death and run away, I'll help pick a new identity.

A weak laugh escaped her. Trust Maya to offer witness protection before breakfast.

Amara typed:

Amara: I'm alive. No fake death yet. I'll call you later.

She hesitated, fingers hovering, then added:

Amara: I took my ring off.

Three dots pulsed almost immediately.

Maya: ...I'm on your side no matter what. We'll talk when you're ready. Eat something first. You always cry uglier on an empty stomach.

Amara smiled despite everything, dropped the phone on the bed, and trudged into the bathroom.

The woman in the mirror looked like she'd survived a storm and lost her umbrella halfway through. Mascara shadows still clung to the corners of her eyes. Her hair was a tangled, frizzy halo, bobby pins from last night jutting out at odd angles.

She removed them, one by one. With each soft metallic clink against the counter, another piece of last night loosened.

Hair perfect. Makeup flawless. Smile on.

She'd made sure everything about herself was polished to match the party. And still, when the photographer needed a ""strong image,"" they'd pulled her husband's ex under her own flowers and left her to stand on the sidelines.

She pressed cool water to her face, letting it wake up the parts of her that wanted to crawl back under the covers and pretend this wasn't real. Then she showered quickly, letting the hot water pound across her shoulders until the knot between her shoulder blades began to ease.

When she stepped out, she avoided looking at her ring.

Her closet was full of soft sweaters and carefully chosen outfits that had, over time, shifted from Amara's style to what Helen called ""presentable for Lane events."" Today, her fingers skimmed past the silk blouses and fitted dresses.

She grabbed dark jeans, a simple white blouse, and a light tan blazer she'd bought for herself before she ever met Jace-back when she still worked at the tiny community center, back when her entire wardrobe was ""things I can afford from the clearance rack.""

The jacket still smelled faintly like that time in her life. Old books. Stale coffee. Cheap printer ink. Hope.

Her phone lit up with the time: 8:12 a.m.

Downstairs, a cabinet closed, then another. A low male voice carried up the stairwell. She couldn't catch the words yet, but her chest tightened anyway.

Don't be paranoid, she told herself. He could be talking to anyone. It could be one of the investors, or his dad, or-

""...we can tweak the investor list,"" Jace was saying as she stepped onto the top stair. His tone was light, almost cheerful. ""You know I trust your judgment, Sienna.""

The name landed like a stone in her stomach.

She'd heard her husband's ""work voice"" a thousand times. The polite, charming tone he used for donors, clients, board members. This one was different. Warmer around the edges. Softer.

""Yeah, Mom loved you there last night,"" he said, moving into the kitchen just out of her sightline. ""You know how she is. You being there made her feel like we were back in the 'good old days.'""

Of course it did.

Amara's grip tightened on the railing. She took another step. The wood didn't creak. Years of living here had taught her where the noisy spots were; right now, she didn't want to give herself away.

A beat of silence.

Then Jace laughed, the low, familiar kind of laugh she used to love pulling out of him. ""Stop,"" he said. ""You're not replacing anyone. Don't start.""

Her jaw clenched.

Replacing anyone.

He knew exactly what he was doing, balancing on a line and pretending there was no edge.

""No, she's fine,"" he continued. ""You saw her. She pulled the whole event together. I swear, my parents would've drowned in champagne without her.""

For a fraction of a second, the words soothed her.

Then he added, ""But yeah, you absolutely stole the show. That dress? They're still talking about it.""

There it was. The twist of the knife.

Amara descended the rest of the stairs, each step a choice. Pretend she hadn't heard? Or make it clear she had?

She paused in the doorway to the kitchen.

Jace stood by the island, back half-turned, phone pressed to his ear. He wore a crisp white shirt and navy slacks, tie slung loosely around his neck. A travel mug and a regular mug sat on the counter, steam curling up in thin ribbons.

""Yes, eleven works,"" he said. ""We can finalize the Harborfront gala then. I'll loop her in.""

Her. Not Amara. Sienna.

He turned then, mid-sentence, and jolted when he saw Amara in the doorway. ""Yeah-hold on a second,"" he murmured into the phone, covering the mic with his palm. ""Morning.""

Morning. As if nothing had cracked open inside her last night.

""Morning,"" she replied, voice even.

He smiled, quick and bright. ""You look nice.""

She glanced down at her outfit. ""It's just clothes.""

He started to say something else, then went back to the call. ""I'll text you the details,"" he said. ""Yeah. See you soon, Sienna.""

The way he said her name-soft, familiar, unthinking-made something in Amara's chest flinch.

""Bye,"" he added, then hung up.

The kitchen fell silent except for the faint hum of the refrigerator.

""It was Sienna,"" he said, as if she'd asked. He set the phone on the counter and grabbed the regular mug, pushing it toward her. ""Coffee?""

She walked forward and wrapped her fingers around the mug. It was warm enough to sting a little. She clung to that feeling, grateful for any sensation that wasn't the hollow ache inside.

""I figured it was her,"" she said. ""You sounded... very happy.""

His jaw ticked. ""I sounded like someone talking to a colleague.""

""Is that what we're calling it?"" she asked lightly. ""Colleagues who once planned their whole future together and then ki-ssed after he got married?""

Color rose along his cheekbones. ""We're not doing this again.""

""We never did this,"" she shot back, then lowered her voice. ""You never wanted to talk about it in the first place.""

He exhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose. ""Amara, last night was stressful. You know how my parents are. My mom was on edge, my dad was watching every tiny mistake, the investors needed hand-holding. We were all tense. I said something stupid. I'm sorry.""

""You said more than one thing,"" she said.

He looked up, eyes finally meeting hers. ""Okay. I said several stupid things. Multiple. Do I regret it? Yes. Do I love you?"" He stepped closer, hand lifting like he meant to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. ""Also yes. You know that, right?""

""I know you say it,"" she replied.

His hand dropped.

""You're my wife,"" he said quietly. ""I married you. That's not... That's not some consolation prize. I wouldn't have walked down that aisle if I didn't want to spend the rest of my life with you.""

""But if she'd said yes first,"" Amara asked before she could stop herself, ""would I even be here?""

The question hung between them, heavy.

For a moment, Jace's face went blank, the way it did when a client asked something he couldn't answer honestly.

""That's not fair,"" he said finally. ""Life didn't happen that way.""

""Which is not the same as 'no,'"" she murmured.

He stiffened. ""You're twisting everything.""

""Am I? Because your dad literally said you would've been 'unstoppable' if you'd married Sienna-in front of me. Your mom keeps calling her the daughter-in-law she prayed for. They call your college years with her the 'golden days.' They still keep a picture of the two of you on the piano in the library, Jace. I dust that frame.""

He flinched at that last part.

""And on top of that,"" she continued, her voice shaking now, ""I find out you ki-ssed her after we were married. And you minimized it. You called it a 'stupid slip,' like you accidentally tripped and landed on her mouth.""

The air between them felt cold.

""I told you it meant nothing,"" he said, his own voice low. ""You know I was drunk. She was drunk. It was a moment. We ended it.""

""You didn't end your feelings,"" Amara whispered. ""Or theirs.""

He looked away for a second, jaw clenching, then back. ""What do you want from me, Amara? Blood? A grand speech? For me to cut every woman out of my life I've ever had history with? That's not realistic.""

""I want a husband who doesn't keep me in a triangle with his past,"" she said. ""I want a family who doesn't act like my existence ruined their favorite love story.""

His eyes tightened. ""My parents will come around.""

""They've had two years,"" she replied. ""How much longer are they waiting?""

A muscle jumped in his cheek. He rubbed the back of his neck, the way he did when he was choosing his words carefully.

""Look,"" he said, switching into that soothing tone he used when calming clients. ""This Harborfront partnership is huge-for me, for the company, for my parents. Sienna is the best person for this job. You know that. She has the experience, the contacts, the polish. She's good at what she does. That's it.""

""It's not 'just it' when your mom looks at her the way she's never looked at me,"" Amara said. ""When your dad keeps hinting that if you'd married her, you'd be further by now.""

He groaned. ""They don't mean it like that.""

""How do they mean it?"" she asked.

""They're old-fashioned. They romanticize things. They talk too much. They're... them."" He waved vaguely, like that explained everything. ""But you know they respect you. My dad always praises your organization. My mom brags about your events.""

""She brags about my usefulness,"" Amara corrected quietly. ""Not me.""",2,1766480271.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1ptp959,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptp959,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)
The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie
The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket
The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants
The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

1ptp7os,https://i.redd.it/uuq6aeos3x8g1.png,Raised Without Hands,"I'm an 8-year-old little boy with Albinism and Type 1 diabetes. My entire life, I have been pushed away, ignored, forgotten, and neglected.

Nobody who shows a care in the world about him out of actual care just paid to make sure he stays out of the way.



But when I discovered I had five more brothers, I was completely shocked.



There are five men in the room.



""Hey, Benjamin,"" one of them says.



I flinch back from my name.



Why are they talking to me?



""Why are you talking to me?"" I gathered my courage to ask.



""Because we-"" one of them starts, stops like he tasted the wrong word, then continues. ""We're your brothers.""



Brothers? The word lands and breaks into sharp pieces.



If they are my brothers, why are they only coming to find me now?



————————



Benjamins POV



There are twenty three windows in the west wing of the house. I counted them last summer, when the power went out and it didn't get fixed till the next day.



Twelve of those windows creak if you open them too fast. Seven have locks that never quite click shut. Three are always just a little fogged, like the glass is trying to hide what's on the other side.



And the one in my bedroom? That one's mine. It's quiet, and it looks out over the side garden where nothing ever grows because it's always in the shade.



I sit there a lot.



Well, when I have free time.



Which is rare.



Today the sky's gray and fuzzy. Kind of like the way I feel when my sugar is low. I press my forehead to the cold glass and draw shapes into the fog with my fingertip circles, a little rabbit, a castle. It smudges fast, but that's okay. I like drawing things that disappear.



I hear the vacuum downstairs. That means it's Marta. She always vacuums around this time, like clockwork. She says she doesn't like ""debris on the carpets,"" but I think she just likes the noise. When it's loud, no one can talk to her. I like that. She understands.



My stomach growls, and I look over at the tray someone left this morning. Toast. Dry. No butter. The juice box is still cold though.



They don't like it when the staff get too friendly. That's what Colin says. He tells them things like, ""He is a responsibility, not a friend."" But I think they just don't like me.



I hear footsteps. Not fast ones like Marta's or heavy ones like Joseph's. These are slow, even, clipped.



Thats Colin.



There's only a few people who ever come into my room, Colin is one of them. He only comes to either check my blood sugar make sure I'm doing my lessons or make sure I'm awake.



I pull my knees up, wrapping my arms around them just as my door creaks open.



""Mr.Ashford ,"" he says, like I'm some old man in a chair, not an eight year old with messy bedhead and a juice box. His voice is clean. Like the house. Like everything he touches.



""Hi, Colin."" I don't turn away from the window.



There's a pause. I hear paper. A clipboard, probably. He always has one.



""It's nearly two o'clock,"" he says. ""Have you eaten?""



""Yeah. Marta gave me a turkey sandwich. No crust."" I look at him now, just a little. ""It was good.""



""That wasn't on the meal schedule."" He steps closer. He wasn't mad. Just... correcting.



""I was hungry,"" I say, like maybe that explains it.



Colin doesn't nod. Doesn't say anything. Just sets the clipboard on my desk and walks over to kneel beside the window seat. He smells like mint and something like paper. Not books, but expensive paper.



""Finger, please.""



I stretch out my hand without looking at it. The left one. He knows I like to keep the right one free in case I want to draw while he's busy with the meter.



My fingers are already sore, a little bruised from this week's pricks.



He doesn't mention it through. He never does.



I watch him work. He's careful. Always careful, sometimes he's extra nice but not all the time. He doesn't talk while he checks my blood sugar, which I like. Some of the nurses used to talk while they did it smiling too much, asking me about cartoons like they forgot I was in the same house where nobody said goodnight or tucked me in.



Or never cared.



""Colin?"" I ask, right as the meter beeps.



He doesn't look up. ""Yes?""



""Do you like working here?""



He finishes noting something on his clipboard before answering. ""It is... orderly."" That's his favorite word. He says it about the dining room. About the laundry rotation. About me, when I'm behaving.



""But do you like me?"" I ask, quieter.



He pauses. Not long. Just enough to feel it.



""You are not the problem,"" he says.



It's the nicest thing anyone's said to me this week.



I watch him stand, straighten his jacket, and smooth the front like he always does. He's not allowed to tuck me in. He told me that once, when I asked. ""Staff is not to overstep."" That's what Mr. Ashford wrote in his handbook. I know because I read it when Colin left it on the table once.



He doesn't say goodbye when he leaves. He just goes. That's okay. I still say it anyway.



""Bye, Colin,"" I whisper to the door after it clicks shut.



Then I lie back down on the window seat, hugging my juice box like a stuffed animal. I watch the fog roll across the garden.



I don't think I'm really alone.



Not really.



Marta vacuumed an extra long time today. Joseph accidentally left my lamp turned on when he finished cleaning. And Colin didn't correct me when I asked him if he liked me.



That's three people.



That's more than yesterday.



And I think that means something.



Even if it's just a little.

Theodore (Theos) POV



The house was quiet, the kind of quiet you only get when everyone's either gone or asleep.



It was late at night,I lost track of time doing paperwork. My office was the only room lit a soft gold circle of light from the desk lamp spilling over piles of papers. The rest of the room sat in shadow, shelves lined with case files, a couple of framed photos I never bothered dusting, and one leather chair by the window that no one but me ever sat in.



I'd been reviewing a batch of security logs from a warehouse contract, the kind of work I could do with one hand while drinking coffee. Tonight, though, the work felt heavier, slower. My mind kept drifting.



That's when my phone lit up beside the laptop.



Unknown number.



I almost ignored it. Nothing good came from unknown numbers this late at night. But something about the timing made me pick it up anyway.



""Hello"" I responded, expecting a spam call.



There was a pause, just long enough to make me wonder if it was a robocall. Then a voice I hadn't heard in years, but one I knew instantly.



""This is Colin Aldridge.""



I straightened in my chair. ""Colin?""



""Yeah,"" he said, quiet, like he was in a place where someone could overhear him if he spoke too loud.



My pulse kicked up. Colin didn't call us. He wasn't allowed to call us our father had made sure of that in writing. ""What are you doing calling me from an unknown number this late at night?""



""I need to tell you something,"" he said, low and steady. ""And you can't tell your father I called.""



That was when I knew this wasn't going to be a small problem. Colin had been in our house since we were kids. He'd been my father's assistant, shadow, and fixer for as long as I could remember. He followed every order down to the letter. If he was calling me in the middle of the night, breaking one of Dad's strictest rules, it was because he'd hit the point where keeping quiet wasn't an option.



""If this is about my father-"" I started.



""It's not,"" Colin cut in. ""It's about your youngest brother.""



I frowned. ""Cassius?""



""No,"" he said, and now his voice had that heavy edge to it. ""You have another brother. His name is Benjamin. He's eight years old. And he's been kept hidden from all of you since the day he was born.""



What...



""Well, hidden from the world."" He says



I sat there in silence, my mind trying to process the words. Hidden. Eight years old. A brother.



Colin doesn't lie.



He wouldn't be calling me without there being a genuine emergency



Colin went on. ""He's lived on the estate his entire life. Yesterday was the first time he's left the property. And... it didn't go well.""



I leaned forward. ""What happened?""



""He met someone dangerous,"" Colin said. ""A man he'd been talking to online. Security stopped it before anything happened, but-"" He paused for a half-second. ""Theo, he won't continue living with this kind of lifestyle. Not with the way your father and mother keep him isolated. Specifically your father. Your mother couldn't care less about Benjamin.""



I ran a hand over my jaw, forcing myself to focus. Colin wasn't the type to exaggerate. If he was saying he was worried he meant it.



""You've been living in that house with him this whole time?"" I asked.



""Yes,"" Colin admitted. ""And my contract forbids me from telling you or your brothers. But I can't keep watching it happen. He has no friends. No freedom. Every single minute of his day is scheduled. Yesterday was supposed to be something good for him, and now after what happened I had to lock him down even more. I'm not allowed to show him that I care, if I do I'll be fired. There's no way for me to explain my reasoning without my job being in jeopardy.""



My mind flashed back to being Benjamin's age. I remembered what it was like to live under our father's control. The rules, the constant pressure, but at least I'd had Augustus, Ali, Nate, Eddie, and Cassius. We'd had each other. Benjamin, this poor kid had no one.



""What are you asking me to do?"" I asked finally.



""I'm asking you to meet him,"" Colin said. ""And to help me get him out before he gets worse.""



The request sat heavy in the air between us. I knew what getting him out would mean going directly against our father, putting myself and my brothers on his bad side. But the picture Colin had painted in my head an eight-year-old locked in that house, alone was worse than any fight with my father.



My brother locked away in the house, alone was worse than any fight with my father.



""I'll need proof,"" I said. ""Photos. Documents. Something I can show the others.""



""I can get that,"" Colin said. ""But it can't be traced back to me. If your father finds out...""



""I get it,"" I said. ""Text me from a different number. I'll send you a secure email. You send me everything you can.""



""Alright,"" Colin said quietly. ""Make your next move fast, Theo.""



The call ended.



I sat there for a moment, staring at my phone. Benjamin. Eight years old. Hidden in plain sight for almost a decade. My father hadn't just kept him from us he'd erased him from the family entirely.



I scrolled through his medical records.



Benjamin born Albino and suffers from Type One Diabetes, requires constant supervision and frequent check ups.



Jesus.



I shook my head, none of this matters, we're still getting him out.



I sent the files to my secure drive and deleted the messages. Then I walked straight back to Augustus's room. He looked up when I came in, and I handed him my phone.



He swore under his breath as he flipped through the photos and documents. ""Yeah,"" he said finally, eyes cold. ""We're getting him out.""

1ptp7de,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptp7de,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)
The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie
The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket
The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants
The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

1ptp6om,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/1ptp6om/living_in_santa_barbara_is_soul_crushing/,Living in Santa Barbara is soul crushing.,"Life in Santa Barbara is truly soul-crushing, especially for new grads and unique, dynamic individuals. With a vibe that is a strange mix of an authoritarian regime, a nature conservancy and a retirement community, it's truly a place designed for a very specific type of individual at the expense of everyone else. 

**Social isolation**

If you're not a wealthy retiree or established family, you'll struggle to find your kind here. Most social events are catering towards these groups, and the insane cost of living and anti-business local policies mean that there are few bars, coffee shops, or community venues. There were some attempts to create some more social opportunities such as Umi App and Meetup but they seem to have died out, leaving a social desert. This is especially awful as I'm queer and there just isn't a queer community here.

Despite being progressive on paper, this city also isn't accepting of differences. Whether you're queer (like my struggle with a lack of a queer community) or simply a unique person, you won't be welcomed in Santa Barbara. The local culture prioritizes extreme conformity and being ""invisible"" unless you're a wealthy, established resident. The slow pace of life also isn't helping. 

**Insane Cost of Living and Economic Woes**

Everyone knows that the Santa Barbara housing market is awful - near zero vacancy rates mean that for the cost of a nice apartment in LA or the Bay Area, you are stuck with a dilapidated shack with no amenities. Still, the lack of housing means that that dilapidated shack will be leased almost immediately. Furthermore, due to local anti-business policies, there are few jobs locally outside of service and retail. Opportunities do exist for late-career professionals, but for new graduates the job market here is hopeless.

These same anti-business policies and high commercial rents mean that specialty stores and other businesses are rare, as well as contractors and service providers. Many people are forced to drive to Ventura or LA for various services, and in-home services are incredibly hard to come by and expensive. Whether you need someone to repair something in your home or are looking for a specialty grocery store, luck is not in your favor.

**The Nature Cult**

Environmentalism is a key part of Santa Barbara's local culture. The few social opportunities that do exist here are centered around nature, such as hiking, water sports, and whale watching. If you're not into these nature activities, it's an incredibly lonely place to be. Nature is also integrated into local politics, influencing policies strongly in the favor of those who are interested in nature. These environmental policies are also a huge driver of the aforementioned housing crisis.

**Dogmatic localism**

Complain about LA or the Bay Area and people seem to understand. Complain about Santa Barbara, however, and you'll be shut down. Locals are incredibly proud of being Santa Barbarians, and any deviation from the local dogma is punished by social exclusion. It's gotten to the point where locals will blindly dismiss legitimate criticisms about the city, claiming they are the ""price of living in paradise.

So yeah, if you're into nature and don't mind paying luxury rent to live in squalor and being socially isolated, Santa Barbara might be the place for you. Otherwise, it's an overhyped awful place to be, it's almost as bad as Carmel (the notoriously anti-fun city that banned ice cream and pickleball). ",0,1766479875.0,SantaBarbara,5,0.36,False

I [M23] had Christmas eve party at work, I have a female coworker, about 30yo, that knows my wife [F39]. We know eachother long, I work here since I was 20. She was going to same pilates classes that my wife went, I invited her and her wife couple times to have barbecue together. About my wife. I met her at my hardest times, I choose her because her affection. I'm very cuddly, I need lots of affection, I know this since I was young and I always wanted a partner that has similar love language. First six years of our relationship were very good till menopause hit. Now my wife hates any touch, even our cat gets on her nerves and doesn't want to be in same room with her. Sex? We all now on sub we are, I don't have to talk about it. My wife's previous marriage was traumatic and full of abuse. My wife when we met had problems with aggression and verbal abuse but she learned to control it in therapy, now it all came back. I started being abusive verbally too and it doesnt help. I always was afraid of screaming and now i scream at her. Two months ago she threw her phone to hit me, it hit the wall and she was mad at me because she broke her phone. I was always cooking in our house, now I just don't care and I'm not proud of it. About co-worker thing. After party we went for a spliff in my car, we wanted to grab some cinnamon rolls and coffee after. My wife and her wife know that we are friends, they don't mind us going out together. We got stoned and wanted to go thrift shopping, she lives quite far away and was waiting for a train so why not. I found nice wool coat and it was fitting well on me. We went to a car, drove to woods near her train station so we can smoke. She asked me to put on that coat, after I did this she started touching it and telling me that it fits perfect on my shoulders. She started touching them, massaging my shoulders and came closer to me. We started hugging, looking eachother in the eyes, on our lips. In that moment it all clicked. It reminded me how touch starved I am and how much touch means to me. I learned that when I was fourteen hugging friend under the blanket during gym class. It felt the same, like it was my first touch. After that we were sitting on a bench, I had my head on her shoulder and we did wife bashing session together. She told me she's available when I need a hug or reassurance. I came home and she started blowing up my phone. I know I have to jump thru hoops to get any form of affection from my wife and I know I can just text that coworker and she will give me that affection. She's available, my wife is not. Now, my question. How do u resist the urge? You know you can't get that affection from your partner and there's other people available, just one text or call. Today I feel like I can't and I'm daydreaming about meeting that coworker.",2,1766479866.0,DeadBedrooms,19,0.74,False

The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

“Pick one. The other one gets to stay and play around with us.” 

The kidnapper’s gun barrel wavered between me and my husband’s childhood sweetheart, Scarlett Hayes. 

And my husband, Harry Vance, he chose to take Scarlett. 

A bone-deep chill gripped me. I stared at him, disbelief twisting my gut.”Harry Vance,” I choked out, “I’m your wife!” 

A flicker of guilt crossed Harry’s eyes, but his resolve remained unwavering. 

“Claire,” he said, his voice tight, “I owe Scarlett my life. I can’t just leave her.” 

He paused, his voice softening. 

“Don’t be scared,” he whispered, “even if… no matter what they do to you… I’ll still love you.” 

His words were a blade, plunged deep into my chest, twisting. 

Menu 

“But I don’t owe her anything!” I shrieked, the words tearing from my throat.”Harry, if you walk out of here with her today, we are done! We will never get back together!” 

Harry’s eyes welled, but he still stooped, carefully lifting the unconscious Scarlett into his arms. 

“Don’t rush off, Mr. Vance!” A voice drawled from the shadows, thick with lewd intent. 

A kidnapper let out a guttural laugh, his fingers already on his belt buckle, as he and the others started to close in. 

“And the boys haven’t had their fun with Mrs. Vance yet!” 

The moment the warehouse door slammed shut, my world imploded. 

The kidnapper ripped my shirt open, his rough palm pressing against the skin of 

my 

waist. 

“Everyone says Mr. Vance worships his wife,” the kidnapper sneered, his foul breath hot on my ear.”Guess he doesn’t love her that much, does 

he?” 

I thrashed, tears blurring my vision. 

Just as the kidnapper ripped my bra strap down, the warehouse door burst open- 

“Police! Don’t move!” 

A gunshot cracked, and the kidnapper pinning me down crumpled. 

I collapsed into a familiar embrace. 

“It’s alright, Claire, it’s alright…” Harry’s voice trembled.”I had an ambush set up outside the whole time. You’re safe…” 

A glacial chill settled deep in my bones. 

What did an ambush matter now? 

At the edge of life and death, he had still chosen Scarlett. 

“We’re… over…” 

With those words, I finally lost consciousness. 

The next time I woke, the familiar ceiling of my bedroom greeted me. 

My fingers twitched, only to find them tightly clasped. 

“You’re awake?” Harry instantly hunched over me, his eyes rimmed with a profound darkness.”Water? Are you hungry? I had the housekeeper make your favorite-” 

you 

walked away with Scarlett?” 

“Harry.” I cut him off, my voice sharp.”Do you remember what I said when y 

His body went rigid. 

“I want a divorce.” 

My voice was frighteningly calm. 

“You just woke up, you need more rest. I’ll go out and get you some wontons.” Harry deliberately avoided my gaze. 

“Avoiding it won’t help.” I pushed myself up, each word falling heavy and deliberate.”Let’s talk about the divorce.” 

His back visibly stiffened, a faint tremor running through him, but he still strode quickly out of the bedroom, forgetting even his jacket. 

I stared at the closed bedroom door, and a memory from five years ago suddenly surfaced. 

7:00:55 

< Claire’s Story 1 

Menu 

Back then, he had just taken over Vance Corp, swamped with work every day, barely able to catch his breath. Yet he would still drive across half the city, just to bring me a bowl of hot wontons. 

“Claire, open up,” he’d say, always wanting to feed me back then, his eyes so tender it almost seemed unreal.”Careful, it’s hot.” 

But now, he couldn’t even bring himself to look at me. 

I forced myself to sit up, opened my laptop, and began drafting the divorce papers. 

Truth be told, Harry and I had been deeply in love. 

So much so that when Scarlett, his childhood friend, caused a scene at the company, he could coldly tell her in front of everyone:”Scarlett, I don’t like you. Have some self-respect.” 

So much so that when Scarlett purposely stumbled into his arms, he would immediately push her away and text me right after:”Claire, someone took advantage of me again. Only a kiss from my wife can make it better.” 

Until that earthquake- 

Scarlett risked her life to rescue him, but was crushed by a falling beam herself, breaking two ribs. 

From that day on, everything changed. 

“Claire, Lettie saved my life,” he’d pleaded, the first time he’d ever asked anything for Scarlett.”She just wants a job at Vance Corp…” 

“Claire, Lettie’s not doing well.” He’d stood me up for Scarlett for the first time. “I’m taking her to the hospital…” 

“Claire, Lettie…” 

Once. Twice. Countless times. 

I understood his guilt. 

But when that guilt, time and again, trampled over our marriage, even my own safety- 

I was exhausted. 

The phone on the coffee table rang just as I slid the signed divorce papers into a file folder. I picked it up, realizing it was Harry’s brother. 

The moment I pressed answer, his voice, frantic and distorted, spilled from the speaker 

“Sister-in-law! You need to get to the Family Mausoleum! Harry made me whip him ninety-nine times to apologize to you. He’s covered in blood now, and he says he won’t get up until you forgive him…” 

My lips twisted. 

Harry was always like this. Every time he hurt me because of Scarlett, he’d find some even more extreme way to prove his love. 

Just like last time, when he stood me up for Scarlett, only to buy an entire rose garden to apologize the next day. 

Just like the time before that, he’d celebrated Scarlett’s birthday, forgetting our anniversary, only to then shell out a fortune on a necklace as an apology. 

Now, it was time for the lashes. 

Did he truly believe a back raw and mutilated with wounds could erase the fact that in a life-or-death moment, he’d chosen her? 

Did he imagine ninety-nine lash marks could possibly erase the terror of my clothes being ripped away by the kidnappers, all while he walked out, cradling Scarlett in his arms? 

Did he truly believe…if only he suffered enough, I would simply melt? 

But this time, I wouldn’t. 

Clutching the divorce papers in my hand, I grabbed my coat and walked out the door. 

Inside the Family Mausoleum, Harry, still in his impeccably tailored suit, knelt before the ancestral tablets. A vast expanse of his back was a crimson mess, skin flayed open, flesh exposed, blood steadily trickling down his spine and soaking into the fabric at his waist. 

When he saw me enter, the defeated, ashen light in his eyes suddenly sparked. 

“Claire…” He stretched a weak hand toward me.”Please, just forgive me? I’ve explained everything about the kidnapping, didn’t I? I would never let anything happen to you… You’re the only one I’ve ever loved, the only one. I can’t live without you…” 

I slowly walked up to him, my gaze falling on the red mark near his collarbone. 

“You say you only love me,” I scoffed.”Then what is this?” 

Harry’s face drained of color.”Lettie said she’d never given a guy a hickey before and insisted on trying it out on me. She saved my life, I 

couldn’t refuse her…” 

013 

< Claire’s Story 1 

He fumbled for a small dagger.”Don’t be angry, I’ll cut this flesh right off!” 

Menu 

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the blade plunged into his skin without hesitation. Blood streamed down his neck, staining the collar of his white shirt crimson. 

“Harry!” His guys immediately rushed forward to snatch the knife away.”Are you out of your mind?” 

The Family Mausoleum erupted into chaos. 

Several of his men frantically searched for a first-aid kit. Others looked at me, their eyes red-rimmed.”Claire, who in our circle doesn’t know how much Harry cares for you? Last year when you were hospitalized with allergies, he stayed by your side for three days and three nights without closing his eyes…” 

“Last month, you’d casually mentioned a fondness for the cherry blossoms in South End. He’d dropped millions, having twenty mature trees transplanted to his villa overnight.” 

“Just forgive him, Claire. It’s nothing, a tiny mistake. Are you really trying to push him over the edge?” 

A tiny mistake? Overreacting? 

I laughed, the sound hollow, my eyes burning. 

Harry pushed past the men, stumbling to his knees before me. 

Blood had already soaked half his collar, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, just looking up at me, his voice a raw plea.”Claire, forgive me…” 

I gazed down at the man I had once loved to my very core and suddenly felt utterly exhausted. 

“Fine,” I said, taking a deep, shuddering breath.”I can forgive you.” 

Harry’s eyes instantly brightened, a spark of hope flickering to life. 

“I have my eye on a house,” I said, pulling a document from my purse.”Buy it for me, and I’ll forgive you.” 

His heart soared with relief. He eagerly flipped open the document, about to read it, when his phone suddenly rang. 

“Harry…” Scarlett’s tearful voice came through the receiver. “I’m running a 102-degree fever. I feel awful…” 

Harry’s expression tightened. Without a glance at the document’s contents, he scribbled his signature, then looked up at me, his eyes pleading. 

“Go,” I said, my voice level. 

A visible wave of relief washed over him. He pushed to his feet, a cautious, almost disbelieving glance aimed my way.”Claire,” he asked, “you’re not angry?” 

I shook my head.”No,” I said, my tone even. 

Only then did the tension drain from his shoulders. He strode away, his group of buddies falling in behind him. 

As I watched their retreating figures, I slowly, deliberately, unfolded the document in my hand. 

The words “Divorce Agreement” stared back at me, Harry’s name scrawled on the signature line, still wet with ink. My fingers ghosted over the still-wet ink. A bitter, mirthless smile touched my lips. 

Harry, congratulations. 

This time, you’ve pushed me out of 

your 

world with your own hands. ",1,1766479650.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1ptp3le,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptp3le,"Monday and Tuesday, North Tassie, AUS","No idea why I'm forgetting so many pictures but I did.

Missing photo of Monday is my classic bowl of peaches, and dinner of I have no idea because I was talking to a social worker about some stuff and we lost track of time and the dinner had been and gone.

Monday lunch was ""Mongolian"" chicken: vague, and white rice: not vague. The chicken was super strong, but the rice was nice. Not made at home nice, but it wasn't crunchy. Undercooked hospital rice has to be a universal experience. 5/10 rice and 2/10 chicken because that was CONCENTRATED and I'm a sensitive coward. COVID made my taste go away for 14 months in 2023, but ever since it came back (even though it's been back for ages) my taste is extremely sensitive, so I'm sure it probably wasn't concentrate, I'm just a bit of a weak coward. One perk is that my coffee is ALWAYS strong. Save that money because I don't have to order extra shots anymore.

Speaking of coffee, I also had a coffee on Monday! They ran out of the specific formula of my tube and were looking around the whole hospital since it's been difficult to find stuff so close to Christmas because everyone's going on leave, so I used the opportunity of being unhooked from the feeds to dip down and get a real human coffee! For normal average people! A delightful occasion and my first time out. ""Love at first sip"" what an adorable cup. 

Breakfast on Tuesday was same thing different fruit: pear this time, and I also forgot a photo. 10/10 because it's exactly what you'd expect canned pear to be. Why rate it lower when you got exactly what you asked for.

Lunch was ""sweet potato flan"" but that does not really look like the flan I know of... These rating things are making me feel bad honestly, cause the kitchen staff usually just work with what they're given 😭 and like they have to make something for an entire hospital's worth of people all at the same time! I do like broccoli and the mushier is good 6/10 for that one

dinner today (Tuesday) was a Tuna patty and veggies, with a generous amount of unspecified fruit yoghurt. I keep feeling very groggy of an evening so I just kind of woke up and thought ""oh crap take picture need to take picture for the Reddit"" like some fever dream and then fell right back into slumber. 

Lastly, my friend did bring me a coffee when I was feeling nauseated this morning so I got them to put it into the fridge and the nurse microwaved it just now since I'm awake again. It is good. Life is good when coffee 10/10 would be 8/10 solely because latte is not the same when reheated... But we get a +2 because I love my friend.

Hope everyone will have a good Christmas eve (it's tomorrow for me, timezones) I was hoping to feel well enough to go out tomorrow and get some red nail polish or festive earrings but looks like that isn't happening. There is this strange thing on the menu tomorrow ""spicy apple"" I do believe they meant ""spiced apple"" but the thought of ""spicy apple"" made me giggle a little. 

Thanks for listening to my waffling. It's getting a bit lonely right now. I feel like I have too many words but not enough energy to say them when it matters. ",7,1766479542.0,hospitalfood,1,0.9,False

​Earth Time: January 12, 2347.

Gitor System, Imperial Territory.

Aboard the transport ship Sandstorm.

​The darkness of space behind the Sandstorm's viewports was deceptive. In the Gitor system, the beating logistical heart of the Empire, the vacuum was not empty—it pulsed with life, and the traffic was as dense as on an Earth highway during rush hour, only stretched across three dimensions. Kael Thorne, sunk deep into a worn pilot’s seat that creaked with every movement, tracked the giant shadows moving in the distance on his sensors.

​These were the Imperial logistics leviathans—heavy, long transports weighing over hundreds of thousands of tons each. They sped at 0.5c along designated vector corridors from Needles two light-months away from the system, carrying goods, raw materials, and technology for the Empire's insatiable economy. The Higgs field disturbances along their designated routes were so severe that the Sandstorm’s navigation systems had to apply minimal course corrections just to avoid being pulled in. Beside them, Kael and Lena’s ship—a modified, ex-Guard first-generation Viper-class transport—looked like a rusty sedan passing a convoy of semi-trucks. Even the Imperial frigates Kael sometimes saw in the docks seemed like mere toys compared to these long transport beasts.

​Inside the cockpit, a drowsy silence prevailed, interrupted only by the rhythmic hum of life support systems and the annoying, quiet buzzing of levitating objects bumping against the bulkheads. The lack of an artificial gravity generator was a tiresome reality they still lacked the credits to change. Kael reached for a sealed water pouch, catching it in mid-air before it could drift to the ceiling. He took a sip through the straw, grimacing with distaste. The water had that characteristic, bland aftertaste of multiple recycling cycles. His thoughts involuntarily drifted to Earth, to the old days spent with T’iyara. He remembered the smell of morning and the weight of a ceramic coffee mug in his hand—the luxury of gravity he had taken for granted back then.

​""Transporting and trading Filopi while bypassing Imperial taxes... that was a bullseye,"" murmured Lena Kowalska, breaking the silence.

​The woman was hanging upside down by the navigation panel, her boots hooked into magnetic grips. Her hair formed a halo around her head, waving lazily with every movement, giving her the appearance of a slightly mad angel.

​""Minimal risk, and the L'thaarr will pay any price for this purple weed,"" she added, tapping her fingers on the virtual keyboard.

​Filopi. An inconspicuous purple plant, a weed growing wild on the planet Gitor. Useless to humans and the reptiles of higher castes, but for the L'thaarr race—second and third-category citizens working in Imperial shipyards and factories—it was one of the few forms of escape. A mild, natural hallucinogen that allowed them to immerse themselves in euphoria for a moment and forget the drudgery. In the Empire, Filopi was legal, but the taxes imposed on its trade and distribution were so draconian that the average worker or engineer couldn't afford it. Smuggling was, therefore, the free market's natural answer to Imperial fiscalism.

​Lena pushed off lightly from the ceiling, performed a graceful spin in zero-g, and landed next to Kael, grabbing the back of his seat.

​""Damn it, Kael, I’m telling you, a few more runs and we’ll be able to afford that bloody generator,"" she stated with passion, following a pen with her eyes as it floated past her nose. ""I’ve had enough of floating in my own sweat. I feel like I’m in an aquarium that no one has cleaned for a month. My hair gets greasy twice as fast, and washing with a sponge is a parody.""

​Kael was skeptical. He replied with his typical cold pragmatism, not taking his eyes off the reactor indicators.

​""What do we need it for? People have been flying in space without that useless gadget forever. It’s a waste of energy and credits. I’d rather invest in a proper overhaul of the Higgs drives and replacing the inertial dampeners. If they fail during an escape or a violent maneuver, a comfortable toilet won’t save our lives. Besides, a general inspection and overhaul is something the Sandstorm needed yesterday.""

​Lena smiled broadly. That glint appeared in her eyes—the one that usually heralded trouble or expenses, but also added to her undeniable charm.

​""You'll see, you'll like shitting in a normal toilet and drinking coffee from a normal mug. Imagine it, Kael. Hot Arabica, steaming upwards, in a heavy ceramic mug. Not sucking lukewarm mush from a tube like an infant. Feel like a human again, not an astronaut from a technology museum.""

​Kael sighed heavily. The vision of a normal toilet was... tempting. Suction systems in zero gravity were humiliating, no matter how many years one had spent in the void.

​""Alright, we haven't earned it yet, Lena, relax,"" he cut the subject short, though privately he admitted she was right. He looked at the blinking comms LED. ""We're connecting. Ta’hirim, do you have the codes?""

​The main screen flared, static buzzing for a moment before the image stabilized. It showed Ta’hirim’s face. She was a female of the Plague race—reptilian, with sharp muzzle features and eyes with vertical pupils that seemed to see more than just the image. Kael felt a slight tightness in his stomach. Ever since celebrating their first successful run and their... incident on Vega Station, relations with her had been a strange mix of hard business and awkward intimacy. The memory of that night, fueled by alcohol and the euphoria of success, still hung between them, unspoken, like a charged capacitor.

​Ta’hirim sat in her office at the docks, her scales glistening in the harsh artificial office light.

​""Of course I have them,"" she hissed. The translator converted it into raspy English with a slight delay, losing the nuances of the sibilant sounds. ""Top-tier transponder codes. With these, you’ll slip past customs patrols like a shadow. The systems will recognize you as authorized medical transport carrying high-grade biomass for elite printing. No one stops that; bureaucracy is afraid the biomass will lose quality due to transport delays before some governor can reprint himself. But... you give me 30% of the profit. In Imperial credits, not useless gold.""

​Kael smiled wryly, shaking his head in disbelief.

​""30%? Last time it was 25%. You're ripping the scales off us, Ta'hirim.""

​Ta’hirim bared her fangs in a smile that would trigger an instinctive flight response in most humans, but Kael detected a certain frivolity in it.

​""The price has gone up. Free market, little mammal,"" she threw back, irony flashing in her reptilian eyes. ""Demand for safe passage is high, and my codes are flawless. If it doesn't suit you, get lost. Besides, the job is local. I’ll find someone else to transport this weed within the system.""

​Kael exchanged a quick glance with Lena. They knew Ta’hirim was only partially bluffing. She was greedy, that was a fact, but also loyal... in her own twisted way.

​""Alright, alright,"" Kael raised his hands in surrender. ""Have it your way. 30%. Send the data.""

​""Pleasure doing business with you."" Ta’hirim’s tone softened. She looked at Kael with a predatory but strangely warm gaze, holding it a second longer than business etiquette required. ""Be careful, Kael. Times are restless after that temporal mess in Ruha'sm. The services are nervous. They're sniffing around everywhere.""

​Four months and a few runs later…

​Earth Time: May 16, 2347.

Gitor Orbit, Transshipment Station.

​The movement at the Sandstorm's cargo airlock was soothingly rhythmic. The magnetic grapples of autonomous loaders silently moved hermetic containers with false labels reading ""Premium Class Biomass for Printing Systems."" In reality, inside was top-quality, freshly harvested, dried Filopi.

​This was their seventh major internal run in this system. Routine, that silent killer of vigilance, had begun to lull them to sleep. Lena, standing by the loading ramp in a light work suit, checked off items on her tablet.

​""Last pallet, Kael,"" she said over the comms, stretching until her spine cracked. ""We're closing the hold and getting out of here. Ta’hirim has already sent the transfer confirmation. That gravity generator is practically ours. I can already taste the coffee from a mug, Kael. Real coffee.""

​Kael sat in the cockpit, routinely checking the maneuvering thruster diagnostics. Everything looked perfect. Too perfect. Green LEDs, stable pressure, full reactor power.

​""Copy that. Standing by for cargo hold hermetization,"" he replied, reaching for the docking sequence switch.

​That was when it happened.

​There was no warning, no radio call to surrender. No negotiations. Instead of the standard dock detachment signal, the ship was shaken by a dull, brutal impact, as if a meteorite had hit them. The lights in the cargo hold flickered and immediately shifted to alarm red. Acrid smoke and the blinding flash of stun grenades burst inside. Before Lena could reach for the weapon at her belt, four laser dots were dancing on her chest.

​""Don't move! Hands on your head! Imperial Security Bureau!"" The voice from the modulator was inhuman, metallic, devoid of emotion, programmed to induce paralyzing fear. These were reptilian warriors in armor gleaming with newness and armed with the latest laser rifles.

​At the same time, the bridge doors were blown off their hinges by a directional charge. The shockwave threw Kael against the console. Before he could touch the pistol hidden under his seat, he was dragged out and thrown to the floor. The heavy, composite boot of a reptilian stormtrooper landed on his neck, pressing his face into the metal grating with force threatening to fracture his vertebrae.

​""Bridge secured. Cargo hold clear. Targets: Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 under control,"" reported an officer in black, matte armor bearing the emblem of an eye inscribed within a clawed paw.

​A minute later, Kael and Lena, bruised and disoriented, were dragged into the mess hall. They were thrown to their knees, their hands shackled behind their backs with magnetic cuffs. For a moment, the only sounds in the room were the heavy breathing of the arrested pair and the hum of ventilation fighting the smoke from the explosion.

​""We have them, Junior Wahara,"" the squad leader tossed into the air, standing at attention.

​In the middle of the table, amidst scattered personal items—an unfinished food ration and dirty clothes—a portable holoprojector activated. Blue light thickened, forming the silhouette of a man.

​In that moment, the atmosphere in the room changed drastically. The brutal chaos of the arrest gave way to something far worse—the cold, surgical precision of intelligence.

​The hologram depicted a man in an impeccable Imperial uniform. He wasn't wearing combat armor, but a dress uniform, perfectly tailored, with discreet but respect-commanding intelligence insignias. His posture was relaxed, almost nonchalant, but his eyes—even in digital projection—scanned the prisoners with analytical coldness, as if looking at errors in code rather than living people.

​It was Kent. The former Colonel of the Guard, the hero of Beijing, now wearing the enemy's colors.

​""Biometric identification positive,"" Kent said. His voice was quiet, velvety, perfectly audible in the sudden silence. There was no anger, triumph, or hatred in it. There was only professional satisfaction, like an analyst closing an operation planned ten moves ahead. ""Hello, Kael. Hello, Lena.""

​Junior Wahara Kent clasped his hands behind his back, slowly ""pacing"" around the kneeling figures, though his digital feet hovered millimeters above the dirty floor.

​""We didn't have to wait long. Operation 'Net' proceeded according to the predictive model. The time variance was merely 0.4%. We monitored your every move. The Filopi distribution network, the encryption algorithms Lena thought were hermetic—which we broke. Even your arrangement with the logistics clerk, Ta’hirim. Every step you took was illuminated by an operational spotlight you had no idea existed.""

​""Kent?"" Lena choked out, spitting blood from a cut lip onto the deck. ""You son of a bitch... You're working for the reptiles now? You, the first soldier of the Guard?! You sold your uniform for a handful of credits?!""

​Kent's hologram stopped in front of her. His face expressed no remorse, only the weariness of someone who has to explain complicated geopolitical phenomena to amateurs.

​""And who am I supposed to serve? Marcus?"" he replied calmly, ignoring the invective as if it were irrelevant background noise. ""Historical analysis is ruthless, Lena. He slaughtered two hundred million people, and you know it well. For him, it was a statistic. A necessary, brutal calculation. Even the Empire, during the landing in Beijing, having full kinetic potential, did not eliminate that many civilian lives. My choice was dictated by logic, not loyalty to Marcus.""

​He leaned in slightly, his digital face centimeters from hers.

​""Surprised by the effectiveness of the Security Bureau?"" he asked rhetorically, raising an eyebrow. ""Along with the return of the ships from the future, we received something more valuable than doubled fleet tonnage. We received information. Complete data packets from the year 2348.""

​Lena paled, understanding the implications.

​""So it's true..."" she whispered. ""That Lena, the one from the future, returned with the fleet? Is she here?""

​Kent nodded slowly, appreciating her deduction.

​""Confirmed. She is a Vice Admiral. She commands Guard forces within the Allied Joint Fleet. They are heading to the Ruha'sm catalyst to make a jump through the tunnel to Earth. They are returning to the starting point, to their original selves.""

​He pointed at Lena and Kael with an open hand, as if presenting exhibits.

​""In that timeline, now extinguished, you remained elusive for much longer. You, Lena, were meant to command part of the Joint Fleet in the future. That version of you became a legend. But you, here and now? You are just a variable in an equation we found thanks to reports from the future. Paradox, isn't it? Your future glory became the cause of your downfall today.""

​Kael looked up.

​""And my version from 2348? Is he returning too?""

​Kent shifted his gaze to the pilot.

​""Negative. Your version did not take part in the expedition to the white dwarf. He is not on the return list. From the perspective of temporal physics, that reality of the year 2348—the one in which you didn't fly—is simply undergoing annihilation. It is being overwritten by a new line of events. According to our scientists, this eliminates the grandfather paradox. You are the only Kael Thorne that matters.""

​Kael felt blood rushing to his head, pulsing in his temples. The survival instinct fought within him against rage. He looked at the insignia on the projection's uniform. Junior Wahara.

​""Holy shit... I know my uncle is a murderer and a dictator, but Kent... you are in the Imperial Security Bureau?"" he whispered in disbelief.

​""I am an officer who ensures that the citizens of the Empire—of all races—sleep soundly,"" the hologram corrected him, smoothing a nonexistent crease on his cuff. ""And I saw your biological father, Kael. I saw Marcus Thorne in the flesh. At least the version from the future that is currently overwriting our reality. And do you know what? That version fears returning to Earth just as I feared capture while fighting on Ruha'sm.""

​Kael jerked violently, causing the magnetic cuffs to grind. The guard behind him took a step forward, deactivating the safety on his weapon, but Kent stopped him with a hand gesture.

​""Aris is my father!"" Kael screamed, a dam breaking in his voice. ""Don't you dare deny that!""

​Kent's hologram smiled, but there was no warmth in that smile. It was a precise strike at the most sensitive point, executed with the grace of an intelligence surgeon.

​""The Security Bureau does not operate on sentiments, Kael. We operate on data. We have full genetic profiles. Aris raised you, that is a sociological fact, but the DNA sequence is unambiguous. You are Marcus's son. However... that is not why we are having this conversation. Your origin is merely operational context. A card in the deck I don't even need to use. I have a stronger trump card.""

​Kent made a sparing movement with his finger. Before the prisoners' eyes, next to his figure, a smaller screen unfolded with a live feed. The image came from a high-security interrogation cell. On a metal chair sat Ta’hirim. She was curled into a ball, stripped of dignity and clan ornaments, her scales dull from stress.

​""Let's get to the crux of the matter; time is a critical resource. Kael, Lena... your associate's status depends on you. Ta'hirim has been qualified for the erasure procedure. And I am not talking about behavioral correction or a labor camp. I am talking about True Death—erasing consciousness from the central database, deleting the backup from the server, formatting her digital soul. For a citizen of the Empire, this is the ultimate end. Non-existence.""

​Kael felt dryness in his throat. He knew what that meant for Ta’hirim. True death.

​""What do you want from us?"" he asked hoarsely. ""How do we save her?""

​Kent brought his face close to Kael's. Holographic eyes bored into his soul, analyzing every micro-expression.

​""According to logs from the future, the relationship between you and Ta'hirim... what happened between you on Vega Station... constitutes a unique psychological lever. Algorithms indicate that your attachment to her exceeds standard business relations by 87%. This makes both of you useful to me. It means I can recruit you instead of punishing you according to the penal code. Emotions are a weakness, Kael, but for a handling officer, they are a perfect tool of control.""

​""What do you want from us to halt the True Death procedure?"" Kael repeated the question, looking straight into Kent's digital eyes.

​The hologram straightened up. The figure took on the traits of an official recruiter, and the tone became matter-of-fact, devoid of the earlier threat, shifting into operational briefing mode.

​""I have a task of the highest priority for you. You are to transport a special cargo to Earth. Smuggle it for the Bureau, right under the noses of everyone—both the Imperial fleet and Earth forces. You will use your talents, your routes, and your legendary luck.""

​""You must be joking,"" Kael scoffed, though his voice lacked conviction. ""That I, along with Lena, would betray humanity? Marcus is who he is, he is a dictator, but thanks to him we defended ourselves against the Plague! I won't be a courier for the enemy.""

​Kent smiled enigmatically. He began pacing the room, his voice taking on a narrative tone, as if telling a story whose ending only he knew.

​""Junior Wahara Kent has a plan,"" he said of himself in the third person, which sounded disturbing and cold. ""You will not betray humanity. Paradoxically, you may save it. You are to transport and bring Vice Admiral Volkov to Earth.""

​Silence fell. The name hit them like a physical blow.

​""That Volkov?"" Lena furrowed her brow, forgetting the pain for a moment. ""He's dead. He died in 2206, during the battle.""

​""The original one, who commanded the attack on Ruha'sm,"" Kent continued, ignoring her interruption. ""He didn't die; he got lucky and had nanites that saved his life. He drifted for two weeks in a damaged suit, on the brink of life and death. He was picked up by our search and rescue units. He has been a valuable prisoner of the Empire for hundreds of years, in the utmost secrecy. Throughout these years... he observed. He gained access to the archives. He knows what Marcus did to 200 million people during the Eternal Spark uprising. He knows the truth that Thorne erases from history textbooks.""

​Kent stopped and looked down at them, like a judge delivering a verdict.

​""For the Empire, as well as for humanity—in my humble opinion, the opinion of an intelligence officer who sees the bigger picture—it will be better if Volkov returns. If he dethrones Marcus and takes power. Marcus is unstable, and two Marcuses could lead to a catastrophe. Their paranoia is growing exponentially. They will try to kill each other. We need someone who understands war but is not a butcher of his own race. Someone with the legitimacy of a hero. Someone who will restore an order acceptable to both the Empire and humanity.""

​He leaned over the table, resting his digital hands on the surface. His gaze was icy.

​""As of today, you are assets of the Imperial Security Bureau,"" he declared in a tone that brooked no opposition. ""Specifically, you work for me. You are my resources in the game for the stability of Earth's political system. A hypothetical Civil War of humanity is not in the Emperor's interest, nor humanity's, especially in light of the colonization of the Newcomers. Welcome to the service. The decision is yours: Ta'hirim's life and a chance to save countless lives, or death in oblivion and the annihilation of your friend's consciousness. The choice seems logical.""

1ptp01p,https://i.redd.it/k2acpj1g1x8g1.jpeg,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)
The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie
The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket
The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants
The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

​Chapter 7: An Unexpected Mission

​Earth Time: January 12, 2347.

Gitor System, Imperial Territory.

Aboard the transport ship Sandstorm.

​The darkness of space behind the Sandstorm's viewports was deceptive. In the Gitor system, the beating logistical heart of the Empire, the vacuum was not empty—it pulsed with life, and the traffic was as dense as on an Earth highway during rush hour, only stretched across three dimensions. Kael Thorne, sunk deep into a worn pilot’s seat that creaked with every movement, tracked the giant shadows moving in the distance on his sensors.

​These were the Imperial logistics leviathans—heavy, long transports weighing over hundreds of thousands of tons each. They sped at 0.5c along designated vector corridors from Needles two light-months away from the system, carrying goods, raw materials, and technology for the Empire's insatiable economy. The Higgs field disturbances along their designated routes were so severe that the Sandstorm’s navigation systems had to apply minimal course corrections just to avoid being pulled in. Beside them, Kael and Lena’s ship—a modified, ex-Guard first-generation Viper-class transport—looked like a rusty sedan passing a convoy of semi-trucks. Even the Imperial frigates Kael sometimes saw in the docks seemed like mere toys compared to these long transport beasts.

​Inside the cockpit, a drowsy silence prevailed, interrupted only by the rhythmic hum of life support systems and the annoying, quiet buzzing of levitating objects bumping against the bulkheads. The lack of an artificial gravity generator was a tiresome reality they still lacked the credits to change. Kael reached for a sealed water pouch, catching it in mid-air before it could drift to the ceiling. He took a sip through the straw, grimacing with distaste. The water had that characteristic, bland aftertaste of multiple recycling cycles. His thoughts involuntarily drifted to Earth, to the old days spent with T’iyara. He remembered the smell of morning and the weight of a ceramic coffee mug in his hand—the luxury of gravity he had taken for granted back then.

​""Transporting and trading Filopi while bypassing Imperial taxes... that was a bullseye,"" murmured Lena Kowalska, breaking the silence.

​The woman was hanging upside down by the navigation panel, her boots hooked into magnetic grips. Her hair formed a halo around her head, waving lazily with every movement, giving her the appearance of a slightly mad angel.

​""Minimal risk, and the L'thaarr will pay any price for this purple weed,"" she added, tapping her fingers on the virtual keyboard.

​Filopi. An inconspicuous purple plant, a weed growing wild on the planet Gitor. Useless to humans and the reptiles of higher castes, but for the L'thaarr race—second and third-category citizens working in Imperial shipyards and factories—it was one of the few forms of escape. A mild, natural hallucinogen that allowed them to immerse themselves in euphoria for a moment and forget the drudgery. In the Empire, Filopi was legal, but the taxes imposed on its trade and distribution were so draconian that the average worker or engineer couldn't afford it. Smuggling was, therefore, the free market's natural answer to Imperial fiscalism.

​Lena pushed off lightly from the ceiling, performed a graceful spin in zero-g, and landed next to Kael, grabbing the back of his seat.

​""Damn it, Kael, I’m telling you, a few more runs and we’ll be able to afford that bloody generator,"" she stated with passion, following a pen with her eyes as it floated past her nose. ""I’ve had enough of floating in my own sweat. I feel like I’m in an aquarium that no one has cleaned for a month. My hair gets greasy twice as fast, and washing with a sponge is a parody.""

​Kael was skeptical. He replied with his typical cold pragmatism, not taking his eyes off the reactor indicators.

​""What do we need it for? People have been flying in space without that useless gadget forever. It’s a waste of energy and credits. I’d rather invest in a proper overhaul of the Higgs drives and replacing the inertial dampeners. If they fail during an escape or a violent maneuver, a comfortable toilet won’t save our lives. Besides, a general inspection and overhaul is something the Sandstorm needed yesterday.""

​Lena smiled broadly. That glint appeared in her eyes—the one that usually heralded trouble or expenses, but also added to her undeniable charm.

​""You'll see, you'll like shitting in a normal toilet and drinking coffee from a normal mug. Imagine it, Kael. Hot Arabica, steaming upwards, in a heavy ceramic mug. Not sucking lukewarm mush from a tube like an infant. Feel like a human again, not an astronaut from a technology museum.""

​Kael sighed heavily. The vision of a normal toilet was... tempting. Suction systems in zero gravity were humiliating, no matter how many years one had spent in the void.

​""Alright, we haven't earned it yet, Lena, relax,"" he cut the subject short, though privately he admitted she was right. He looked at the blinking comms LED. ""We're connecting. Ta’hirim, do you have the codes?""

​The main screen flared, static buzzing for a moment before the image stabilized. It showed Ta’hirim’s face. She was a female of the Plague race—reptilian, with sharp muzzle features and eyes with vertical pupils that seemed to see more than just the image. Kael felt a slight tightness in his stomach. Ever since celebrating their first successful run and their... incident on Vega Station, relations with her had been a strange mix of hard business and awkward intimacy. The memory of that night, fueled by alcohol and the euphoria of success, still hung between them, unspoken, like a charged capacitor.

​Ta’hirim sat in her office at the docks, her scales glistening in the harsh artificial office light.

​""Of course I have them,"" she hissed. The translator converted it into raspy English with a slight delay, losing the nuances of the sibilant sounds. ""Top-tier transponder codes. With these, you’ll slip past customs patrols like a shadow. The systems will recognize you as authorized medical transport carrying high-grade biomass for elite printing. No one stops that; bureaucracy is afraid the biomass will lose quality due to transport delays before some governor can reprint himself. But... you give me 30% of the profit. In Imperial credits, not useless gold.""

​Kael smiled wryly, shaking his head in disbelief.

​""30%? Last time it was 25%. You're ripping the scales off us, Ta'hirim.""

​Ta’hirim bared her fangs in a smile that would trigger an instinctive flight response in most humans, but Kael detected a certain frivolity in it.

​""The price has gone up. Free market, little mammal,"" she threw back, irony flashing in her reptilian eyes. ""Demand for safe passage is high, and my codes are flawless. If it doesn't suit you, get lost. Besides, the job is local. I’ll find someone else to transport this weed within the system.""

​Kael exchanged a quick glance with Lena. They knew Ta’hirim was only partially bluffing. She was greedy, that was a fact, but also loyal... in her own twisted way.

​""Alright, alright,"" Kael raised his hands in surrender. ""Have it your way. 30%. Send the data.""

​""Pleasure doing business with you."" Ta’hirim’s tone softened. She looked at Kael with a predatory but strangely warm gaze, holding it a second longer than business etiquette required. ""Be careful, Kael. Times are restless after that temporal mess in Ruha'sm. The services are nervous. They're sniffing around everywhere.""

​Four months and a few runs later…

​Earth Time: May 16, 2347.

Gitor Orbit, Transshipment Station.

​The movement at the Sandstorm's cargo airlock was soothingly rhythmic. The magnetic grapples of autonomous loaders silently moved hermetic containers with false labels reading ""Premium Class Biomass for Printing Systems."" In reality, inside was top-quality, freshly harvested, dried Filopi.

​This was their seventh major internal run in this system. Routine, that silent killer of vigilance, had begun to lull them to sleep. Lena, standing by the loading ramp in a light work suit, checked off items on her tablet.

​""Last pallet, Kael,"" she said over the comms, stretching until her spine cracked. ""We're closing the hold and getting out of here. Ta’hirim has already sent the transfer confirmation. That gravity generator is practically ours. I can already taste the coffee from a mug, Kael. Real coffee.""

​Kael sat in the cockpit, routinely checking the maneuvering thruster diagnostics. Everything looked perfect. Too perfect. Green LEDs, stable pressure, full reactor power.

​""Copy that. Standing by for cargo hold hermetization,"" he replied, reaching for the docking sequence switch.

​That was when it happened.

​There was no warning, no radio call to surrender. No negotiations. Instead of the standard dock detachment signal, the ship was shaken by a dull, brutal impact, as if a meteorite had hit them. The lights in the cargo hold flickered and immediately shifted to alarm red. Acrid smoke and the blinding flash of stun grenades burst inside. Before Lena could reach for the weapon at her belt, four laser dots were dancing on her chest.

​""Don't move! Hands on your head! Imperial Security Bureau!"" The voice from the modulator was inhuman, metallic, devoid of emotion, programmed to induce paralyzing fear. These were reptilian warriors in armor gleaming with newness and armed with the latest laser rifles.

​At the same time, the bridge doors were blown off their hinges by a directional charge. The shockwave threw Kael against the console. Before he could touch the pistol hidden under his seat, he was dragged out and thrown to the floor. The heavy, composite boot of a reptilian stormtrooper landed on his neck, pressing his face into the metal grating with force threatening to fracture his vertebrae.

​""Bridge secured. Cargo hold clear. Targets: Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 under control,"" reported an officer in black, matte armor bearing the emblem of an eye inscribed within a clawed paw.

​A minute later, Kael and Lena, bruised and disoriented, were dragged into the mess hall. They were thrown to their knees, their hands shackled behind their backs with magnetic cuffs. For a moment, the only sounds in the room were the heavy breathing of the arrested pair and the hum of ventilation fighting the smoke from the explosion.

​""We have them, Junior Wahara,"" the squad leader tossed into the air, standing at attention.

​In the middle of the table, amidst scattered personal items—an unfinished food ration and dirty clothes—a portable holoprojector activated. Blue light thickened, forming the silhouette of a man.

​In that moment, the atmosphere in the room changed drastically. The brutal chaos of the arrest gave way to something far worse—the cold, surgical precision of intelligence.

​The hologram depicted a man in an impeccable Imperial uniform. He wasn't wearing combat armor, but a dress uniform, perfectly tailored, with discreet but respect-commanding intelligence insignias. His posture was relaxed, almost nonchalant, but his eyes—even in digital projection—scanned the prisoners with analytical coldness, as if looking at errors in code rather than living people.

​It was Kent. The former Colonel of the Guard, the hero of Beijing, now wearing the enemy's colors.

​""Biometric identification positive,"" Kent said. His voice was quiet, velvety, perfectly audible in the sudden silence. There was no anger, triumph, or hatred in it. There was only professional satisfaction, like an analyst closing an operation planned ten moves ahead. ""Hello, Kael. Hello, Lena.""

​Junior Wahara Kent clasped his hands behind his back, slowly ""pacing"" around the kneeling figures, though his digital feet hovered millimeters above the dirty floor.

​""We didn't have to wait long. Operation 'Net' proceeded according to the predictive model. The time variance was merely 0.4%. We monitored your every move. The Filopi distribution network, the encryption algorithms Lena thought were hermetic—which we broke. Even your arrangement with the logistics clerk, Ta’hirim. Every step you took was illuminated by an operational spotlight you had no idea existed.""

​""Kent?"" Lena choked out, spitting blood from a cut lip onto the deck. ""You son of a bitch... You're working for the reptiles now? You, the first soldier of the Guard?! You sold your uniform for a handful of credits?!""

​Kent's hologram stopped in front of her. His face expressed no remorse, only the weariness of someone who has to explain complicated geopolitical phenomena to amateurs.

​""And who am I supposed to serve? Marcus?"" he replied calmly, ignoring the invective as if it were irrelevant background noise. ""Historical analysis is ruthless, Lena. He slaughtered two hundred million people, and you know it well. For him, it was a statistic. A necessary, brutal calculation. Even the Empire, during the landing in Beijing, having full kinetic potential, did not eliminate that many civilian lives. My choice was dictated by logic, not loyalty to Marcus.""

​He leaned in slightly, his digital face centimeters from hers.

​""Surprised by the effectiveness of the Security Bureau?"" he asked rhetorically, raising an eyebrow. ""Along with the return of the ships from the future, we received something more valuable than doubled fleet tonnage. We received information. Complete data packets from the year 2348.""

​Lena paled, understanding the implications.

​""So it's true..."" she whispered. ""That Lena, the one from the future, returned with the fleet? Is she here?""

​Kent nodded slowly, appreciating her deduction.

​""Confirmed. She is a Vice Admiral. She commands Guard forces within the Allied Joint Fleet. They are heading to the Ruha'sm catalyst to make a jump through the tunnel to Earth. They are returning to the starting point, to their original selves.""

​He pointed at Lena and Kael with an open hand, as if presenting exhibits.

​""In that timeline, now extinguished, you remained elusive for much longer. You, Lena, were meant to command part of the Joint Fleet in the future. That version of you became a legend. But you, here and now? You are just a variable in an equation we found thanks to reports from the future. Paradox, isn't it? Your future glory became the cause of your downfall today.""

​Kael looked up.

​""And my version from 2348? Is he returning too?""

​Kent shifted his gaze to the pilot.

​""Negative. Your version did not take part in the expedition to the white dwarf. He is not on the return list. From the perspective of temporal physics, that reality of the year 2348—the one in which you didn't fly—is simply undergoing annihilation. It is being overwritten by a new line of events. According to our scientists, this eliminates the grandfather paradox. You are the only Kael Thorne that matters.""

​Kael felt blood rushing to his head, pulsing in his temples. The survival instinct fought within him against rage. He looked at the insignia on the projection's uniform. Junior Wahara.

​""Holy shit... I know my uncle is a murderer and a dictator, but Kent... you are in the Imperial Security Bureau?"" he whispered in disbelief.

​""I am an officer who ensures that the citizens of the Empire—of all races—sleep soundly,"" the hologram corrected him, smoothing a nonexistent crease on his cuff. ""And I saw your biological father, Kael. I saw Marcus Thorne in the flesh. At least the version from the future that is currently overwriting our reality. And do you know what? That version fears returning to Earth just as I feared capture while fighting on Ruha'sm.""

​Kael jerked violently, causing the magnetic cuffs to grind. The guard behind him took a step forward, deactivating the safety on his weapon, but Kent stopped him with a hand gesture.

​""Aris is my father!"" Kael screamed, a dam breaking in his voice. ""Don't you dare deny that!""

​Kent's hologram smiled, but there was no warmth in that smile. It was a precise strike at the most sensitive point, executed with the grace of an intelligence surgeon.

​""The Security Bureau does not operate on sentiments, Kael. We operate on data. We have full genetic profiles. Aris raised you, that is a sociological fact, but the DNA sequence is unambiguous. You are Marcus's son. However... that is not why we are having this conversation. Your origin is merely operational context. A card in the deck I don't even need to use. I have a stronger trump card.""

​Kent made a sparing movement with his finger. Before the prisoners' eyes, next to his figure, a smaller screen unfolded with a live feed. The image came from a high-security interrogation cell. On a metal chair sat Ta’hirim. She was curled into a ball, stripped of dignity and clan ornaments, her scales dull from stress.

​""Let's get to the crux of the matter; time is a critical resource. Kael, Lena... your associate's status depends on you. Ta'hirim has been qualified for the erasure procedure. And I am not talking about behavioral correction or a labor camp. I am talking about True Death—erasing consciousness from the central database, deleting the backup from the server, formatting her digital soul. For a citizen of the Empire, this is the ultimate end. Non-existence.""

​Kael felt dryness in his throat. He knew what that meant for Ta’hirim. True death.

​""What do you want from us?"" he asked hoarsely. ""How do we save her?""

​Kent brought his face close to Kael's. Holographic eyes bored into his soul, analyzing every micro-expression.

​""According to logs from the future, the relationship between you and Ta'hirim... what happened between you on Vega Station... constitutes a unique psychological lever. Algorithms indicate that your attachment to her exceeds standard business relations by 87%. This makes both of you useful to me. It means I can recruit you instead of punishing you according to the penal code. Emotions are a weakness, Kael, but for a handling officer, they are a perfect tool of control.""

​""What do you want from us to halt the True Death procedure?"" Kael repeated the question, looking straight into Kent's digital eyes.

​The hologram straightened up. The figure took on the traits of an official recruiter, and the tone became matter-of-fact, devoid of the earlier threat, shifting into operational briefing mode.

​""I have a task of the highest priority for you. You are to transport a special cargo to Earth. Smuggle it for the Bureau, right under the noses of everyone—both the Imperial fleet and Earth forces. You will use your talents, your routes, and your legendary luck.""

​""You must be joking,"" Kael scoffed, though his voice lacked conviction. ""That I, along with Lena, would betray humanity? Marcus is who he is, he is a dictator, but thanks to him we defended ourselves against the Plague! I won't be a courier for the enemy.""

​Kent smiled enigmatically. He began pacing the room, his voice taking on a narrative tone, as if telling a story whose ending only he knew.

​""Junior Wahara Kent has a plan,"" he said of himself in the third person, which sounded disturbing and cold. ""You will not betray humanity. Paradoxically, you may save it. You are to transport and bring Vice Admiral Volkov to Earth.""

​Silence fell. The name hit them like a physical blow.

​""That Volkov?"" Lena furrowed her brow, forgetting the pain for a moment. ""He's dead. He died in 2206, during the battle.""

​""The original one, who commanded the attack on Ruha'sm,"" Kent continued, ignoring her interruption. ""He didn't die; he got lucky and had nanites that saved his life. He drifted for two weeks in a damaged suit, on the brink of life and death. He was picked up by our search and rescue units. He has been a valuable prisoner of the Empire for hundreds of years, in the utmost secrecy. Throughout these years... he observed. He gained access to the archives. He knows what Marcus did to 200 million people during the Eternal Spark uprising. He knows the truth that Thorne erases from history textbooks.""

​Kent stopped and looked down at them, like a judge delivering a verdict.

​""For the Empire, as well as for humanity—in my humble opinion, the opinion of an intelligence officer who sees the bigger picture—it will be better if Volkov returns. If he dethrones Marcus and takes power. Marcus is unstable, and two Marcuses could lead to a catastrophe. Their paranoia is growing exponentially. They will try to kill each other. We need someone who understands war but is not a butcher of his own race. Someone with the legitimacy of a hero. Someone who will restore an order acceptable to both the Empire and humanity.""

​He leaned over the table, resting his digital hands on the surface. His gaze was icy.

​""As of today, you are assets of the Imperial Security Bureau,"" he declared in a tone that brooked no opposition. ""Specifically, you work for me. You are my resources in the game for the stability of Earth's political system. A hypothetical Civil War of humanity is not in the Emperor's interest, nor humanity's, especially in light of the colonization of the Newcomers. Welcome to the service. The decision is yours: Ta'hirim's life and a chance to save countless lives, or death in oblivion and the annihilation of your friend's consciousness. The choice seems logical.""

The other one gets to stay and play around with us.” 

The kidnapper’s gun barrel wavered between me and my husband’s childhood sweetheart, Scarlett Hayes. 

And my husband, Harry Vance, he chose to take Scarlett. 

A bone-deep chill gripped me. I stared at him, disbelief twisting my gut.”Harry Vance,” I choked out, “I’m your wife!” 

A flicker of guilt crossed Harry’s eyes, but his resolve remained unwavering. 

“Claire,” he said, his voice tight, “I owe Scarlett my life. I can’t just leave her.” 

He paused, his voice softening. 

“Don’t be scared,” he whispered, “even if… no matter what they do to you… I’ll still love you.” 

His words were a blade, plunged deep into my chest, twisting. 

Menu 

“But I don’t owe her anything!” I shrieked, the words tearing from my throat.”Harry, if you walk out of here with her today, we are done! We will never get back together!” 

Harry’s eyes welled, but he still stooped, carefully lifting the unconscious Scarlett into his arms. 

“Don’t rush off, Mr. Vance!” A voice drawled from the shadows, thick with lewd intent. 

A kidnapper let out a guttural laugh, his fingers already on his belt buckle, as he and the others started to close in. 

“And the boys haven’t had their fun with Mrs. Vance yet!” 

The moment the warehouse door slammed shut, my world imploded. 

The kidnapper ripped my shirt open, his rough palm pressing against the skin of 

my 

waist. 

“Everyone says Mr. Vance worships his wife,” the kidnapper sneered, his foul breath hot on my ear.”Guess he doesn’t love her that much, does 

he?” 

I thrashed, tears blurring my vision. 

Just as the kidnapper ripped my bra strap down, the warehouse door burst open- 

“Police! Don’t move!” 

A gunshot cracked, and the kidnapper pinning me down crumpled. 

I collapsed into a familiar embrace. 

“It’s alright, Claire, it’s alright…” Harry’s voice trembled.”I had an ambush set up outside the whole time. You’re safe…” 

A glacial chill settled deep in my bones. 

What did an ambush matter now? 

At the edge of life and death, he had still chosen Scarlett. 

“We’re… over…” 

With those words, I finally lost consciousness. 

The next time I woke, the familiar ceiling of my bedroom greeted me. 

My fingers twitched, only to find them tightly clasped. 

“You’re awake?” Harry instantly hunched over me, his eyes rimmed with a profound darkness.”Water? Are you hungry? I had the housekeeper make your favorite-” 

you 

walked away with Scarlett?” 

“Harry.” I cut him off, my voice sharp.”Do you remember what I said when y 

His body went rigid. 

“I want a divorce.” 

My voice was frighteningly calm. 

“You just woke up, you need more rest. I’ll go out and get you some wontons.” Harry deliberately avoided my gaze. 

“Avoiding it won’t help.” I pushed myself up, each word falling heavy and deliberate.”Let’s talk about the divorce.” 

His back visibly stiffened, a faint tremor running through him, but he still strode quickly out of the bedroom, forgetting even his jacket. 

I stared at the closed bedroom door, and a memory from five years ago suddenly surfaced. 

7:00:55 

< Claire’s Story 1 

Menu 

Back then, he had just taken over Vance Corp, swamped with work every day, barely able to catch his breath. Yet he would still drive across half the city, just to bring me a bowl of hot wontons. 

“Claire, open up,” he’d say, always wanting to feed me back then, his eyes so tender it almost seemed unreal.”Careful, it’s hot.” 

But now, he couldn’t even bring himself to look at me. 

I forced myself to sit up, opened my laptop, and began drafting the divorce papers. 

Truth be told, Harry and I had been deeply in love. 

So much so that when Scarlett, his childhood friend, caused a scene at the company, he could coldly tell her in front of everyone:”Scarlett, I don’t like you. Have some self-respect.” 

So much so that when Scarlett purposely stumbled into his arms, he would immediately push her away and text me right after:”Claire, someone took advantage of me again. Only a kiss from my wife can make it better.” 

Until that earthquake- 

Scarlett risked her life to rescue him, but was crushed by a falling beam herself, breaking two ribs. 

From that day on, everything changed. 

“Claire, Lettie saved my life,” he’d pleaded, the first time he’d ever asked anything for Scarlett.”She just wants a job at Vance Corp…” 

“Claire, Lettie’s not doing well.” He’d stood me up for Scarlett for the first time. “I’m taking her to the hospital…” 

“Claire, Lettie…” 

Once. Twice. Countless times. 

I understood his guilt. 

But when that guilt, time and again, trampled over our marriage, even my own safety- 

I was exhausted. 

The phone on the coffee table rang just as I slid the signed divorce papers into a file folder. I picked it up, realizing it was Harry’s brother. 

The moment I pressed answer, his voice, frantic and distorted, spilled from the speaker 

“Sister-in-law! You need to get to the Family Mausoleum! Harry made me whip him ninety-nine times to apologize to you. He’s covered in blood now, and he says he won’t get up until you forgive him…” 

My lips twisted. 

Harry was always like this. Every time he hurt me because of Scarlett, he’d find some even more extreme way to prove his love. 

Just like last time, when he stood me up for Scarlett, only to buy an entire rose garden to apologize the next day. 

Just like the time before that, he’d celebrated Scarlett’s birthday, forgetting our anniversary, only to then shell out a fortune on a necklace as an apology. 

Now, it was time for the lashes. 

Did he truly believe a back raw and mutilated with wounds could erase the fact that in a life-or-death moment, he’d chosen her? 

Did he imagine ninety-nine lash marks could possibly erase the terror of my clothes being ripped away by the kidnappers, all while he walked out, cradling Scarlett in his arms? 

Did he truly believe…if only he suffered enough, I would simply melt? 

But this time, I wouldn’t. 

Clutching the divorce papers in my hand, I grabbed my coat and walked out the door. 

Inside the Family Mausoleum, Harry, still in his impeccably tailored suit, knelt before the ancestral tablets. A vast expanse of his back was a crimson mess, skin flayed open, flesh exposed, blood steadily trickling down his spine and soaking into the fabric at his waist. 

When he saw me enter, the defeated, ashen light in his eyes suddenly sparked. 

“Claire…” He stretched a weak hand toward me.”Please, just forgive me? I’ve explained everything about the kidnapping, didn’t I? I would never let anything happen to you… You’re the only one I’ve ever loved, the only one. I can’t live without you…” 

I slowly walked up to him, my gaze falling on the red mark near his collarbone. 

“You say you only love me,” I scoffed.”Then what is this?” 

Harry’s face drained of color.”Lettie said she’d never given a guy a hickey before and insisted on trying it out on me. She saved my life, I 

couldn’t refuse her…” 

013 

< Claire’s Story 1 

He fumbled for a small dagger.”Don’t be angry, I’ll cut this flesh right off!” 

Menu 

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the blade plunged into his skin without hesitation. Blood streamed down his neck, staining the collar of his white shirt crimson. 

“Harry!” His guys immediately rushed forward to snatch the knife away.”Are you out of your mind?” 

The Family Mausoleum erupted into chaos. 

Several of his men frantically searched for a first-aid kit. Others looked at me, their eyes red-rimmed.”Claire, who in our circle doesn’t know how much Harry cares for you? Last year when you were hospitalized with allergies, he stayed by your side for three days and three nights without closing his eyes…” 

“Last month, you’d casually mentioned a fondness for the cherry blossoms in South End. He’d dropped millions, having twenty mature trees transplanted to his villa overnight.” 

“Just forgive him, Claire. It’s nothing, a tiny mistake. Are you really trying to push him over the edge?” 

A tiny mistake? Overreacting? 

I laughed, the sound hollow, my eyes burning. 

Harry pushed past the men, stumbling to his knees before me. 

Blood had already soaked half his collar, but he seemed oblivious to the pain, just looking up at me, his voice a raw plea.”Claire, forgive me…” 

I gazed down at the man I had once loved to my very core and suddenly felt utterly exhausted. 

“Fine,” I said, taking a deep, shuddering breath.”I can forgive you.” 

Harry’s eyes instantly brightened, a spark of hope flickering to life. 

“I have my eye on a house,” I said, pulling a document from my purse.”Buy it for me, and I’ll forgive you.” 

His heart soared with relief. He eagerly flipped open the document, about to read it, when his phone suddenly rang. 

“Harry…” Scarlett’s tearful voice came through the receiver. “I’m running a 102-degree fever. I feel awful…” 

Harry’s expression tightened. Without a glance at the document’s contents, he scribbled his signature, then looked up at me, his eyes pleading. 

“Go,” I said, my voice level. 

A visible wave of relief washed over him. He pushed to his feet, a cautious, almost disbelieving glance aimed my way.”Claire,” he asked, “you’re not angry?” 

I shook my head.”No,” I said, my tone even. 

Only then did the tension drain from his shoulders. He strode away, his group of buddies falling in behind him. 

As I watched their retreating figures, I slowly, deliberately, unfolded the document in my hand. 

The words “Divorce Agreement” stared back at me, Harry’s name scrawled on the signature line, still wet with ink. My fingers ghosted over the still-wet ink. A bitter, mirthless smile touched my lips. 

Harry, congratulations. 

This time, you’ve pushed me out of 

your 

world with your own hands. ",1,1766478917.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1ptowu5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptowu5,"Recent Pickups. (ERD, Vetements, Acne, Margiela)","1. Acne Studios Long Sleeve Tee (Sage Green)
The Vibe: Clean, minimalist, Scandi-cool. Review: A solid basic. The color is a really nice muted sage/grey—super versatile and works well with both black and blue denim. The centered circular logo adds just enough branding without being obnoxious. It looks like a relatively lightweight cotton, good for layering. Pros: Great colorway. Subtle flex. Easy to style. Cons: It’s just a long sleeve tee at the end of the day. If the blank isn't heavy, it might not feel worth the premium price tag. Score: 7.5/10

2. Vetements ""Vengeful Spirit"" / Cradle of Filth Hoodie
The Vibe: Dark, edgy, oversize heavyweight. Review: This is a statement piece. The sun-faded/washed black effect on the cotton looks really authentic and high-quality. The graphics are incredibly ""loud""—distinctly Vetements style with the heavy metal typography and the pentagrams down the sleeve. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you are into the opium/grunge aesthetic, this hits the mark. The skull print looks properly distressed. Pros: The wash is beautiful; it looks like a vintage band tee that’s been worn for 20 years. Cons: It’s very aggressive. Hard to wear in a ""normie"" setting without looking like you're trying too hard. Score: 8.5/10

3. Acne Studios Leather Collar Harrington Jacket
The Vibe: Retro, smart-casual, ""old money"" adjacent. Review: This is a classy piece. The contrast between the beige cotton body and the brown leather collar elevates it significantly. It gives off a vintage workwear vibe but with a modern, boxy cut. The snap buttons and clean placket keep it looking sharp. Pros: Timeless design. You can wear this to a nice dinner or just hanging out. The leather collar adds a luxury touch. Cons: The elastic waist hem can sometimes bunch up and make the fit look too round if you aren't careful with sizing. Score: 8.5/10

4. Balenciaga Convertible Camo Cargo Pants
The Vibe: Utilitarian, tactical, oversized. Review: These go hard. The grey/monochrome camouflage is much easier to style than traditional green camo. The best feature is clearly the zippers at the knee—turning them into shorts makes them a 2-in-1 piece, which justifies the purchase. The pockets look massive and functional. Pros: The convertible zip-off feature is a game changer. The fit looks baggy in the right way (classic Balenciaga silhouette). Cons: Lots of straps and drawstrings can be annoying in daily life. You have to be tall or wear chunky shoes to pull these off without dragging the hem. Score: 9/10

5. Nike Air Zoom Alphafly (Black/Red)
The Vibe: Pure performance, technical runner. Review: This is strictly a functional shoe. The exposed Air Zoom pods and the aggressive stack height scream ""marathon runner."" The black and silver with the red gradient sole looks fast. Pros: Probably the most comfortable shoe here for actually walking or running. Tech looks cool. Cons: Very hard to style casually. You can't really wear these with jeans or cargos (like the Balenciagas above) without looking like a gym teacher. These belong on the track or with activewear only. Score: 7/10 (10/10 for running, 4/10 for fashion).

6. Maison Margiela Replica GATs (Pink/Salmon)
The Vibe: Sophisticated, soft luxury, spring essential. Review: Beautiful pair. The German Army Trainer (GAT) silhouette is a classic for a reason, but this soft pink/salmon colorway makes it pop. The contrast between the suede paneling, the smooth leather, and the gum sole is perfect. These look buttery smooth. Pros: Unique colorway that isn't too bright. Extremely comfortable silhouette. High-quality material mix. Cons: Suede on light-colored shoes is a nightmare to keep clean. One drop of coffee and it's over. Score: 9.5/10 (My personal favorite of the lot).

7. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Black Suede)
The Vibe: Cozy, essential, ""off-duty"" model. Review: You really can't go wrong here. The black suede Bostons are arguably the most versatile shoe in modern streetwear. They bridge the gap between house slippers and actual footwear. The suede texture in the photo looks nice and plush, not flat. Pros: Ultimate comfort. They go with everything—sweats, denim, the camo cargos from part 1. Cons: Suede maintenance. You cannot wear these in the rain, or they are ruined. Score: 9/10 (A wardrobe staple).

8. Acne Studios ""Stockholm 1996"" Tee (Faded Navy)
The Vibe: Vintage casual, subtle luxury. Review: Another solid basic from Acne. The ""Stockholm 1996"" stamp has that cracked, worn-in look that makes it feel like a thrift store find (but with better fit). The garment dye/wash on the blank gives it a nice depth—it’s not just a flat navy blue. Pros: The neckline looks tight and high quality (won't sag easily). Boxy fit is flattering. Cons: It’s a logo tee. If you aren't a fan of branding, it might be too much text. Score: 7.5/10

9. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) Text Hoodie (Grey/Taupe)
The Vibe: Grunge, depressive luxury, ""I slept in this."" Review: Classic ERD aesthetic. The wash on this is fantastic—it has that sun-faded, dusty taupe color that is really hard to replicate. The distressing on the hood and hems looks authentic. The simple serif font logo is understated but recognizable to those who know. Pros: The wash/color is unique. The crop on the waist looks good for layering. Cons: The price point for ERD is always controversial for something that looks ""destroyed."" The pocket distressing looks a bit fragile; be careful not to rip it further. Score: 8/10

10. Enfants Riches Déprimés (ERD) ""e r d"" Graphic Hoodie (Brown)
The Vibe: Punk, collage art, distressed. Review: I prefer this one over the text-only hoodie. The warm brown tone is rich, and the three-panel graphic gives it more visual interest. It looks slightly heavier/more structured than the grey one. The ""mud wash"" effect is done really well here. Pros: Great color palette for fall/winter. The graphics give it a band-merch feel without being a specific band. Cons: Same as above—extremely distressed look isn't for every occasion. Score: 8.5/10

11. Supreme x Yohji Yamamoto x Vanson Leathers Split Jacket
The Vibe: Grail status, aggressive, high-fashion biker. Review: This is the highlight of the entire haul. The collaboration between Supreme, Yohji, and Vanson is legendary. The split graphic on the sleeves (the abstract/wolf design) looks incredible. The leather looks stiff and heavy, which is typical for Vanson—it will take a long time to break in, but it’s bulletproof quality. Pros: Insane flex. The construction looks top-tier. It’s a piece of art. Cons: Comfort will be low initially; Vanson leather is notoriously stiff. It’s also very loud—you need a simple outfit underneath to let the jacket talk.

1. It is one of the top 10 Tec companies 
2. Planned HQ will be moving to a more CBD area than where they used to be located.
3. Most likely fully completed with in a 5 year time line.
4. About 50,000 employees not including support staff will need to go to work at that new HQ.

The question is what kind of business can I do around the planned HQ? 

I have thought of:
1. Become a second land lord and just buy or long term lease then sub lease it to other retail business

I’m Japanese and have been based in Alameda for about 10 years. I’m importing shelf-stable, fully sealed matcha powder from Japan and trying to find a small, compliant place to store it in Oakland, Alameda or San Leandro.

What I’m looking for:

A small shelf or back-room space, potentially inside a café, commercial kitchen, or similar business

Or a third-party FDA-registered storage or fulfillment facility

Or a small space that my LLC could register as an FDA food facility

Something that can pass county health permitting requirements (dry, shelf-stable product only)

There will be no food prep, no brewing, and no repacking. Just sealed matcha tins sitting on shelves.

1ptot9a,https://i.redd.it/mt98hf5oxw8g1.png,The Ice-Cold General Learned Regret in the Language of Roses,"Chapter 1

Everyone in Southport said Scarlett Jones was the city’s wildest red rose—pale skin, knockout looks, and a flair for drama.

In the year she was partying hardest overseas, her father yanked her back home with an overnight express letter marked URGENT. It held only one cold line: \[Come home at once. Marry Ethan Foster.\]

Ethan Foster was the youngest rising star on the base—cool, restrained, almost ascetic, rigidly self-disciplined, the complete opposite of her in every way.

She thrived on noise and crowds; he preferred quiet and order.

She did whatever she liked and had a long history of reckless stunts, while he followed every rule to the letter, treating discipline like something carved in stone.

She was bright and free-spirited, changing boyfriends the way other people changed clothes, and he was infamous for avoiding women altogether, never even brushing the hand of a female soldier under his command.

Just thinking about marrying a man so straight-laced made her feel like she couldn’t breathe.

So, determined to blow up the wedding, Scarlett threw everything she had at the problem.

She partied and danced for three straight nights at a downtown club, hoping he’d finally back off, but he showed up in full dress uniform, and under all the curious stares, he calmly slung her onto his back and carried her home.

She deliberately crashed into the base commander’s front-yard fence, wanting him to see how outrageous she could be, but he went over in person to apologize, paid for the repairs, and buried the whole thing before it could spread.

She charged forward raising hell without a care, and he was always right behind her, quietly cleaning up whatever mess she left in her wake.

This time, she’d gotten into another fight and was being held at the station. He had just finished a three-day emergency mission when he rushed over to bail her out, still in uniform, his eyes bloodshot with exhaustion.

Looking at his tired but ramrod-straight back, Scarlett felt a rare urge to explain herself.

She wanted to say that this time she wasn’t the one causing trouble, that the other guy had made a move on her first because he thought she was pretty, but before she could get the words out, Ethan was already in front of her, gently taking her hand.

There was a tiny cut on the tip of her finger, something she hadn’t even noticed, and he pulled a small first-aid kit from his uniform pocket, lowered his head, disinfected the wound, and pressed a bandage over it.

“Does it hurt?” he asked.

In that moment, every excuse and argument Scarlett had prepared jammed in her throat.

He lifted his gaze, his eyes steady. “I don’t care how much trouble you cause or how big a mess you make. I can handle all of that. The only thing I care about is whether this—right here—hurts.”

Does this hurt…

Scarlett’s heart lurched, as if something had slammed into the softest part of her chest, shattering every last one of her defenses in an instant.

All her life, whenever she got into trouble, her father only shouted about how embarrassing she was, and her stepmother only put on a fake show of telling her to act like a lady, but not once had anyone ever asked her if she was hurt, or if she felt wronged.

With her voice gone hoarse, she heard herself say, “Ethan, we can get married.”

Something like a flicker of light passed through his dark eyes.

“But before that, I need to ask you something,” she pressed, her pride and possessiveness sharpening her tone. “Do you have anyone you’ve ever loved and couldn’t have? My man has to belong to me completely. He doesn’t get to have anyone else in his heart—past, present, or future. It can only be me.”

Ethan’s gaze locked onto hers, heavy and unwavering. “No. Only you.”

So Scarlett married him.

Southport’s wildest red rose married the coldest, most untouchable officer in the entire military.

After the wedding, one line started making the rounds in Southport’s upper circles.

Of all the people you could mess with, don’t you dare mess with General Foster’s wife, Scarlett Jones.

Because no matter how big a mess she made, that stone-faced grim reaper of a general would still be right behind her, always having her back and keeping the world from crashing down on her.

Scarlett honestly believed that she’d melted that block of ice with her fire.

Right up until the day she went out to the base to drop off some files Ethan had forgotten at home.

As she reached the training grounds, she saw a cluster of officers gathered together in what looked like some sort of mixer, where the mood was loud and lively.

Ethan was surrounded by a few fellow officers, and it looked like he’d just lost a game and was being pushed into answering one of those truth-or-dare questions.

Someone called out, loud and clear, “General Foster, come on—what’s the biggest lie you’ve ever told in your life?”

The noise around them dipped, the group settling down as everyone turned to watch the commanding officer who was known for being rigidly honest.

Ethan was silent for a moment, his profile shadowed and hard under the lights, and then he picked up the coffee mug in front of him, took a sip, and finally spoke, his voice low but clear enough to carry right to where Scarlett had just stepped into the doorway.

“Someone once asked me if I had someone I loved and couldn’t have.”

“I lied and told her no.”

It was like a thunderclap going off inside her head.

Scarlett froze where she stood, every drop of blood in her body turning to ice.

He’d lied?

He had someone he loved and couldn’t have?

Then why had he told her he didn’t?

Why had he married her at all?

A chill shot up from the soles of her feet and raced through her entire body, leaving her feeling like she’d been dropped into a block of ice, her limbs shaking from the cold.

She was just about to storm over and demand an answer when one of his aides hurried to Ethan’s side and murmured something in his ear.

Ethan’s usually composed face changed in an instant.

He shot to his feet so fast he didn’t even pause to explain to anyone, snatched his uniform jacket from the back of his chair, and headed for the door, moving so quickly he left a gust of air in his wake.

He didn’t even notice her standing right there in the doorway.

As he barreled past, his shoulder slammed hard into hers, and he didn’t react at all, like every sense he had was locked onto a single target up ahead.

Scarlett staggered from the hit, pain flaring in her shoulder, but the ache in her chest was even worse.

She swallowed the pain and the roiling questions in her gut and found herself following after him on instinct.

She watched Ethan jump into a Jeep, the engine roaring to life before it shot out of the lot like an arrow.

Scarlett immediately flagged down a car and ordered the driver to stay right on his tail.

The vehicles finally stopped outside an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

Ethan rushed inside with his aide on his heels, and Scarlett slipped in after them, keeping to the shadows.

Inside the warehouse, a wild-eyed kidnapper was holding a knife to a young woman’s throat.

The girl was wearing a simple, elegant dress and was sobbing so hard she looked heartbreakingly fragile, like she might faint at any second.

The moment Ethan saw her, his face darkened, and his voice held a barely noticeable tremor. “Let her go.”

The kidnapper let out an ugly laugh. “Knew I picked the right target! Ethan, everyone out there says you spoil that out-of-control wife of yours, Scarlett, but I’m the only one who knows the person you really keep at the center of your world is her—Nora West.”

Nora West? Scarlett’s heart dropped like a stone.

The kidnapper kept shouting, “On that last border mission, because of you, my guys ended up dead or maimed! Today, I’m going to make you feel what it’s like to lose the person you love most!”

The veins on the back of Ethan’s hand stood out, but his voice stayed as steady as he could make it. “I’m the one you want. Let her go and take it out on me.”

“Let her go? Sure.” The kidnapper kicked a knife across the floor, the blade flashing coldly as it skidded to a stop at Ethan’s feet. “Stab yourself in the chest. Then I’ll think about letting her walk.”

“No! Ethan, don’t!” Nora wailed, shaking her head as tears streamed down her face.

Ethan held her gaze for a long, deep second, and the look in his eyes was so full of feeling that Scarlett realized she had never once seen him look at her that way.

Then he bent, scooped up the knife, and drove it into his own chest without a moment’s hesitation.

In the shadows, Scarlett dug her nails so hard into her palms that she nearly broke the skin, and it was the only thing that kept her from screaming.

He could actually try to kill himself—without hesitation—for another woman.

Chapter 2

“Now can you let her go?” Ethan’s face was chalk white, sweat beading on his forehead, but he still forced himself to stand straight. “Let her walk and take it out on me instead. Whatever you want to do to me—even if you want my life—you can have it.”

“Hahahahaha!” The kidnapper’s laughter turned wild. “So you really are crazy in love with her, huh? Then I want to kill her even more. I want you to know what real despair feels like.”

Just as he raised the knife to bring it down on Nora, the security detail that had been lying in wait around the warehouse burst in and took him down in seconds.

Nora tore free and threw herself at Ethan, clinging to him as she sobbed so hard she could barely get the words out. “Ethan! Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how dangerous that was? You could’ve died!”

Ethan weakly lifted a hand and gently brushed her tears away, his voice low. “Don’t cry. It doesn’t hurt.”

“Look at all this blood and you’re still saying it doesn’t hurt?” Nora’s panic flared into anger, and she suddenly snatched the bloody knife off the floor and dragged it across her own forearm.

Blood welled up instantly.

“What are you doing?” Ethan’s face changed in an instant, and he grabbed her wrist in a rush.

Nora stared at him through a blur of tears, her voice coming out broken. “Does it hurt now? Ethan, do you have any idea what it does to me, seeing you like this?”

She jabbed a finger at her own chest. “It hurts here, just as much as it does for you. So from now on, even if you won’t do it for yourself, at least don’t pull stunts like that for my sake.”

Ethan looked at the angry red gash on her arm and at the fierce resolve in her eyes, and his own vision went hot around the edges.

He pulled her into a tight hug, his voice raw. “Okay. From now on, I’ll take better care of myself.”

Soon, an ambulance arrived, and the paramedics loaded Ethan onto a stretcher and rushed him out.

From start to finish, no one noticed Scarlett standing in the shadows at the back of the warehouse, her face drained of color.

She felt like someone had pulled every ounce of strength out of her body, leaving her shivering with cold.

What exactly was Ethan to Nora?

The way he looked at her, the way he’d stabbed himself without a second thought for her, the way she’d cut into her own arm for him—all of it added up to a bond no one else could touch, a live-or-die connection between them…

A storm of questions and icy guesses spun through Scarlett’s mind so fast she thought she might lose it.

Just then, a shadow fell over her.

Scarlett lifted her head and saw Nora standing in front of her, not even sure when Nora had gotten there.

Without the slightest warning, Nora’s hand whipped out and cracked across Scarlett’s face.

Scarlett’s head snapped to the side, her cheek blazing with pain.

Rage surged straight to her head; Scarlett had never been one to turn the other cheek, and she didn’t even stop to think before her own hand came up, ready to slap her back just as hard.

“Go ahead. Hit me. Beat me to death for all I care.” Nora lifted her chin, eyes squeezed shut like she was walking to her execution, her voice thick with tears and hate. “Your precious Jones family has already destroyed my life with Ethan. If he and I can’t be together in this lifetime, I don’t want to live anyway.”

Scarlett’s raised hand shook and froze in the air.

She swallowed the pain burning in her cheek and in her chest and stared Nora down, forcing the words through clenched teeth. “You and Ethan—what exactly are you to each other?”

Nora looked at her with a smile that was both bitter and laced with sarcasm, and then she laid out the so-called truth from beginning to end.

Two years ago, she and Ethan had been in love, already talking seriously about getting married.

Then she was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder and told she needed a rare, insanely expensive imported drug just to stay alive.

And in all of Southport, the only person with the connections to get that drug was Scarlett’s father.

To save her, Ethan went to beg her father for help.

Richard Jones agreed—but he named his price. He had a daughter, Scarlett, wild and impossible, spoiled and out of control, and she needed someone who could finally rein her in.

If Ethan agreed to marry Scarlett and give her a child, Richard would hand over the medication.

So Ethan married Scarlett—and cut off any chance he and Nora had of ever being together.

By the time Nora finished, Scarlett felt like she’d been struck by lightning; her teeth sank into her lower lip so hard that the metallic taste of blood spread slowly through her mouth.

So that was it.

No wonder no matter how hard she pushed, how much chaos she caused, Ethan still seemed dead set on marrying her and refused to let go.

No wonder that after the wedding he indulged her in everything, yet in bed he never seemed to have enough of her, coming after her almost every night, driving her past exhaustion even when she begged him to stop.

The spoiling and affection she thought she’d won turned out to be nothing more than compromises he’d forced himself to make—for another woman’s sake.

The humiliation and the hurt were so fierce they nearly tore her apart.

She stared at Nora, her gaze sharp as a knife. “If even a single word of what you just said is a lie, I swear I’ll make you wish you were dead.”

She paused, her voice splintering into something cold and final. “But if it’s true, then I’ll settle this—for you and for him.”

With that, she turned away without another glance and stormed back to the Jones house.

The moment she walked in, she saw her charming, womanizing father at the dining table with his demure wife and a cluster of spoiled illegitimate kids, all of them gathered around, enjoying a cozy family dinner.

“Richard Jones.” Scarlett used his full name, her voice icy. “We need to talk.”

Her father’s face darkened as he set his fork down with a clatter. “Watch your tone. You’ve been married to Ethan all this time and still haven’t picked up an ounce of his steadiness. Can’t even bother to call me Dad anymore? You’re getting more out of line by the day.”

Scarlett stared at him through reddened eyes and said nothing.

The next second, she stepped forward, grabbed the heavy tablecloth with both hands, and yanked it hard.

Plates and glasses crashed to the floor with a roar, food and soup splattering everywhere, sending her stepmother and the kids into a chorus of shrieks.

“Now,” Scarlett said, standing in the middle of the wreckage, her eyes locked on her father, “can you talk to me properly?”

Chapter 3

Everyone stared at her in stunned silence.

“You—you ungrateful girl!”

Her stepmother snapped out of it first and rushed over to smooth things over. “Scarlett, if you have something to say, say it calmly. Don’t make your father angry…”

“You don’t get to talk here.” Scarlett’s voice cracked like a whip. “A homewrecker who clawed her way up from being a third-rate actress doesn’t get to lecture me about anything.”

Her stepmother’s face went from pale to flushed and back again, and she turned toward Richard with tears trembling in her eyes.

Richard was seething, but seeing his daughter in full scorched-earth mode, he swallowed his anger and waved for his wife to take the frightened kids upstairs.

“What the hell are you throwing a tantrum about now?”

Scarlett met his eyes and forced out each word. “Was it you who used that miracle drug to force Ethan to marry me?”

Richard’s gaze flickered. “What nonsense are you talking about…”

“You know perfectly well whether it’s nonsense.” Scarlett stepped in closer, pressing him. “Richard Jones, answer me. Was it, or wasn’t it?”

Looking at his daughter on the edge of a breakdown, Richard knew he couldn’t hide it any longer and finally snapped, “So what if it was me? I did it for your own good. Ethan’s talented, with a future most families would kill for in a son-in-law. I landed you a catch like that—how exactly am I wrong here?”

“You’re my daughter. You think I’d hurt you? Only a man like Ethan can handle you. You’re only going to be happy with someone like him.”

“Happy?” Scarlett let out a broken laugh. “You’re really going to call a marriage built on lies and a business deal happiness? Let me tell you something, Richard Jones—I’ve got more men chasing me than I know what to do with. I don’t need disgusting tricks like this to chain one down.”

She drew a long breath and ripped the mask off him. “And stop pretending this is all for me. You just wanted to get rid of the daughter who’s been fighting you over my mother all these years. You know my standards are high and I won’t look twice at most men, so you picked Ethan, made sure I’d fall for him, marry him, and give him a kid. Once I had a family of my own, you figured he’d talk me into dropping any claim to your money so you could leave every last dollar to the woman you love and her illegitimate kids, isn’t that right?”

Richard’s face went through several shades at once, but he still clung to his flimsy defense. “You—you’re making things up!”

“I’m making things up?” Scarlett laughed until tears slipped free, hanging on to the last of her pride. “Fine. Whether that was your plan or not, I’m officially telling you this: I don’t want a single cent of this inheritance.”

Richard froze, and a flicker of barely concealed delight flashed through his eyes.

Scarlett caught every trace of it, and her heart sank straight to the bottom, going completely numb.

“But I have two conditions,” she said, enunciating each word. “First, you hand over the drug to Ethan. Second, you use every connection you’ve got to push our divorce through as fast as possible.”

Richard had still been furious, but the moment she clearly gave up the inheritance, his expression eased, and he even tried to salvage his dignity with a fake sigh. “Fine. You can’t force love. If you want out, then get out. Your father just wants you to be happy.”

“But the drug,” he added, changing tack, “I can’t give you that yet.”

He had one of the staff bring him a pad and pen, scribbled out an agreement right there, and slid it across the table to her. “Once the court signs off on your divorce, you go back overseas, stay there quietly, and stop causing trouble here. You’ll state in black and white that you’re giving up any claim to the Jones estate. Then I’ll make sure Ethan gets the medication.”

Scarlett stared at the cold sheet of paper, feeling like her chest was being sliced open.

So this was her father—no trace of genuine love for his daughter, just layer after layer of schemes for himself and his shiny new family.

She picked up the pen, her hand trembling, and still forced herself to press down hard and sign her name, stroke by stroke.

“Push the divorce through as quickly as you can,” she said, setting the pen down and fixing her father with a frozen stare. “And if I find out you never gave Ethan that drug…”

She paused, her tone turning ruthless, ready to burn everything down with herself. “I’m not as by-the-book as Ethan. I’ll just blow this place sky-high. You, that woman, and every one of those kids will go down with it.”

With that, she didn’t spare another glance at Richard’s stunned, furious face, just turned on her heel and walked out of the house that made her sick.

She didn’t go back to Ethan’s place either but headed straight for the downtown club she used to haunt.

For three straight days, she lived at that club—drinking, dancing, trying to drown herself in alcohol and noise, but only ending up feeling more hollow and cold inside.

A few of her closest friends, having heard how she’d been spending her nights there, finally couldn’t take it anymore and grabbed her when her eyes were already going glassy with booze. “Scarlett, what on earth is going on with you?”

Scarlett squinted at them through a drunk haze and managed a smile that looked worse than crying. “What could possibly be wrong? Same as always—drinking, having fun…”

“You haven’t gone this hard since you got married,” one of them said worriedly. “Isn’t General Foster always all over you in bed…?”

“All over me?” Scarlett’s voice cracked. “Do you have any idea why he keeps dragging me into bed?”

Her chest hurt so badly she thought it might split open; she tossed back the rest of her drink in one shot, the burn scorching her throat and her heart.

She couldn’t hold it in any longer and spilled everything.

Her friends were furious when she finished, cursing Ethan for being blind and calling her father shameless.

Scarlett only laughed, the sound full of exhaustion and self-mockery. “Look at me. I can have any man I want. I’m not going to beg for one whose heart already belongs to someone else.”

“Exactly. You’ve got the looks and the family name,” one friend huffed. “Guys who want to marry you could line up from Southport all the way to Paris, and Ethan doesn’t even appreciate it.”

“Yeah. With your personality, there’s no way you’d ever look back. Even if he ended up on his knees begging you, it wouldn’t make a difference,” another chimed in.

Scarlett smiled, but her eyes were full of bitter irony.

Beg her? He’d never beg her.

Once she left the country and made sure Nora got the drug, clearing the way for the two of them, he’d probably be too busy celebrating to even think of asking her to stay.

Her chest clenched again and again, and she excused herself to the restroom, needing a few minutes alone.

But as soon as she stepped out, a man reeking of alcohol blocked her path and slid a hand toward her waist.

“All by yourself, sweetheart?” he drawled. “You’re gorgeous. How about a dance with me?”

Scarlett had already been in a foul mood, and her gaze went ice-cold as she drew breath to go off on him.

A sickening crack cut through the music, followed by a scream like a stuck pig.

“Aaagh!”

Scarlett looked up and found herself staring into a face that was always sharply handsome and now carved over with ice.

It was Ethan.

Chapter 4

He was in street clothes, but there was still a hard, cutting edge to him that made people flinch.

He stared down at the man who was grimacing in pain, his voice as cold as ice. “Get out of here. If I ever see you lay a hand on her again, I’ll break both your hands.”

The man finally saw who it was and went white as a sheet, stammering apologies as he scrambled to his feet and bolted.

“Look at you, General Foster, really throwing your weight around,” Scarlett said, forcing down the storm inside her and twisting her mouth into a mocking smile. “What brings someone as important as you to a little place like this?”

Ethan frowned slightly as he looked at her. “I was out on an emergency mission the last few days. I got back and heard you’ve been here for three straight nights. There’s a limit to how far you can push it. It’s time to go home.”

Emergency mission? Scarlett’s heart gave a sharp, stabbing twist in her chest.

We’d be a great match if you have creative spirit, sense of humor, and/or a sensitive demeanor. How I write typically fluctuates based on who I’m talking to, but I am the type who is equal parts playful as I am serious. 

I am 28 going on 29 living in Florida, USA (not originally from Florida). I’m open to penpals around my age bracket (24-34) but if you don’t fit in this bracket and think we’d get on well then please chime in! I’m currently working PT as a tutor for students with special needs/academic disabilities. In January I will be a PT student as I’ve decided to take some art classes. 

As a Writing, Literature, and Publishing student, I fell out of the habit of reading in my mid-twenties once I graduated from undergrad. But I’m happy to share that I have finally come back around to it. Right now I’m reading 1897 Dracula! 

Anyway, I’m hoping to explore a more meaningful, curious, and intentional lifestyle next year. I wish to connect with others who have unique experiences/POVs to share. Not sure how much it matters, as I’m fairly used to talking to folks across political spectrums, but I do identify as liberal and will probably get on best with folks who are also liberal or open-minded. 

Some of my interests include:
- Art / crafting / Drawing
- Cooking 
- Asian culture (I am half Taiwanese) 
- Learning about different cultures 
- Reading widely but mostly classic or canon lit 
- Singing 
- Gaming
- Water (swimming pools, sea, baths, hot springs) 
- Coffee techniques and varieties 
- Fashion
- Music 
- Romanticizing life 

If you’d like to do some low pressure (once a month or as convenient) but medium-long length handwritten letter exchanges with me, please reach out and let me know a little about you! ",3,1766478260.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

# Capítulo 1: The Devil’s Secretary

***\[Music: The Devil You Know By X Ambassadors\]***

*The Kings’.*

Every single person in Midnight City knew that name. It wasn’t just a name, but a brand… the epitome of the city’s very foundation.

I was the secretary to Ares King, CEO of King Corp. Yes, *the King.* The impenetrable billionaire bachelor with looks that could make you drop your panties and scream fuck me! *But personality?* Not so much, he’s a walking hump of ice who has one thing in mind. *Business.*

*2*

Those poor, unfortunate souls who thought they could have a chance with him are better off in the Bermuda Triangle.

As his secretary, I had to be flawless to the last detail, had to be three steps ahead, had to swallow up whatever emotional shit I’m going through, and act like my life is made of no worries.

When you work for Ares King, you’re not a person, just a tool to get things done, and questions are not asked.

But it’s time to close that chapter.

“Okay.” I pushed my glasses to the bridge of my nose. “Just press the damn button, Catherine. Don’t hold out on me now.”

I thought this was gonna be easy. I was expecting a swift decision, not hanging for the last hour.

I chewed on my nails as anxiety got the better of me. Realizing my habit, I forced my hand to my lap.

“Deep breaths, you can do this. You can—”

“Ms. Lane,” a deep, gruff voice came through the earpiece I wore.

I flinched, clicking print on impulse. *Great! Who knew that was the push I needed?*

“Y-Yes, Mr King?” I replied shakily, my heart in my throat.

“Coffee.”

The intercom went off, and I closed my eyes. After all this time, Catherine, you still haven’t gotten used to that voice.

I sighed when the printer made a soft humming noise. “One last coffee run for my devil boss.”

When I get back, I’m bringing my resignation letter to his office, and then this chapter is closed, *locked* with the key thrown into the abyss.

*1*

I pushed to my feet, my stilettos making a sharp click-clack. I opened the door and stepped into the bullpen, where rows of desks stretched out in a bland display, phones ringing and keyboards clacking with haste.

There wasn’t a single thing out of place, the perfect air for a billion-dollar company with overqualified people.

Unlike me, who had to work my ass from the gutter up, most of them here had privileges I didn’t.

I just happened to land this position because I passed the one-month trial period, aka *the curse month.* No one had lasted that long, hence the eerie label.

Either they get their heart broken when their romantic endeavors toward the CEO don’t work, or they get mentally stressed to the point they drop out faster than a bowling ball, battling the next year in therapy.

Ares King wasn’t called the devil CEO for nothing. You know that feeling when you’re constantly at the edge of the cliff? Well, that’s working for him, and it doesn’t sum it all up.

I had so much on my plate, and against all odds, I dealt with all the shit thrown at me. I worked for the devil for three fucking years. Therefore, I was given a nickname.

“Here she comes.”

“The devil’s secretary.”

*1*

“I don’t know if I should be amazed or disturbed.”

“Color me disturbed.”

“Working closely with Mr. King must be a major trauma load.”

“How does she do it?”

“You don’t think she’s—”

“Nahhh, doubt that. He certainly wouldn’t settle for someone like her.”

“True, he can date models, not a wash-up version.”

*Ouch.*

“She probably thinks she’s some kinda big shot pulling this off.”

“Maybe she just stayed, hoping for a chance with Ares King.”

“Don’t they all?”

“Not all can take that load. She’s definitely desperate.”

“Stooping so low for a chance, unbelieveable.”

“Shhh! She’s close!”

*Every. Single. Time.* I thought I’d get used to their gossip by now, but they always found a way to make it greatly *impactful.*

Nevertheless, I kept my posture, walking professionally as if their words never bothered me.

\~☆\~

I set the coffee on the table to grab the paper from the printer when the doors leading to my boss’s office open with force. A man stepped out, fury twisted on his face.

He snappily loosens his tie. “Fuck him! Fuck this company! Fuck you too!”

I frowned at him. “Sir, I’m gonna ask you to leave before I call security.”

“My entire project is in the mud, all because of one mistake!”

I was already dialing a number, and I made sure he could see me doing it. I’m accustomed to this display, and they sometimes get violent.

In a single day, dreams are crushed and careers are ruined. Not everyone can take that calmly.

“Your boss is evil!” He came towards me, and I took cautious steps back.

I’m still traumatized by when someone tossed a stapler at me and destroyed my desk.

Footsteps echoed, grasping our attention. Ares King emerged, spotless in his three-piece suit. Hair as dark as midnight and cold blue eyes that could freeze you over with one look.

“Is there a problem, Mr. Hayes?” he asked calmly.

I shivered at the lifeless tone.

“Y-You didn’t give me a chance. This is my life’s work. You can’t do this to me!”

“Chance is equivalent to a risk. I’m not risking millions of dollars on a failed project.”

*1*

“Failed project? It hasn’t even—”

“This discussion ended when I gave my final verdict.”

“You can’t just—”

“Do yourself a favor and leave before you lose something else other than your career.”

The threat hung in the air, and Mr. Hayes couldn’t tell if he was serious or making a light-hearted threat.

*1*

The security team was already here, and I sighed in relief. They dragged him out as he cried and appealed for a chance before following it up by cursing the King’s name.

That was the fifth one today, and the day wasn’t even over yet.

*2*

“Ms. Lane. I have a meeting in an hour. Is everything ready?”

*Crap!* I haven’t prepared for that. I was hoping to bring my letter early. *It’s not too late.*

I approached him, stretching my hand for him to take the coffee. “Um, Mr. King, I—”

He pinned me with those cold blue eyes, and I rephrased my words.

“E-Everything will be ready in a few minutes.” I fixed my usual fake smile.

He was back in his office, leaving me hanging. I checked my watch and saw his coffee order had exceeded fifteen minutes.

*Such a waste.*

I subconsciously drank from the cup and grimaced, sticking out my tongue.

That was not a wise move, given that he took his coffee black with no sugar.

“Yuck!”

\~☆\~

I ended up leaving the letter on his desk after he left the office. Not exactly what I had in mind, but it’d suffice. Ares King wouldn’t bat an eye when he sees it. All I care about is what comes after.

I pressed the keycard at the doorknob, and it opened with a soft click. I didn’t tell him I was coming, but I was hoping to stop by after having such a hectic day.

I struggled to take off my stilettos. This was the worst day to forget my flats, now my feet are all sore.

I flipped on the light switch. “You won’t believe the day I had. Don’t worry, I did it. Well, not as planned, but… It’s still a win.”

I dropped my bag, striding to the fridge for water, but I paused midway when I spotted an open bottle of champagne with two wine glasses.

*Did he have someone over?*

I cast a brief look around the apartment before bringing my gaze back to them. I narrowed my eyes when I caught a stain… *a red lipstick.*

“You’re so beautiful.”

*That was Dan’s voice*. It was coming from the room.

“You like that, don’t you, Danny? Like the way I ride your cock?”

Yesterday, my husband and I were in our tiny apartment with cheap wine. Celebrating. 

Because we’d finally paid off his million-dollar debt. Five years of hell-over. 

Then today, his FIANCÉE walks through our door. 

Lawyer at her side. Divorce papers in hand. 

“Miss Winters, thank you for these five years. You’ve been amazing.” She said, smiling like I’m the nanny she’s firing. 

“But Jake’s REAL wife and Anson’s REAL mom is back now. So let’s not make this messy. Time to go.” 

My brain shuts down. I can’t speak. Can’t move. 

It turned out that five years of my life? Just a “human stress test” Jake had to pass before daddy handed him the keys to the kingdom. 

It turned out that my husband? NOT my husband. My son? NOT my son! 

All just a test. A game. 

And me? I was nobody. A random pick. A prop during this shit show. 

BULLSHIT! They thought I’d take this? Swallow it down and leave quietly? 

WRONG! 

Jake Sutherland loved playing poor? Fine. 

Then I’ll make sure he be poor. For REAL this time. 

Yesterday, Jake and I were in our shoebox apartment, raising cheap wine to celebrate. We’d finally paid off his million-dollar debt. 

Today, his FIANCÉE Rosalie Laurent is at my door with a lawyer, sliding divorce papers across the table. 

“Sloane.” Her voice is warm, practiced. “Thank you for these five years. You’ve been amazing.” 

She smiles like she’s dismissing a nanny. “But Jake’s REAL wife is back now. Anson’s REAL mom. So let’s keep this clean, okay? Time for you to go.” 

My mind goes blank. I try to speak. Nothing comes out. 

Rosalie sees it. She picks up the remote and turns on the TV.

Tested Me with Fake Poverty? Pay Me Real Billions, Darling 

Chapter 1 

Jake fills the screen. Sharp suit. Perfect smile. The headline reads: 

“Jake Sutherland: Sole Heir Returns.” 

The anchor’s voice is full of praise. “After completing his grassroots training, Jake Sutherland has proven himself to the board. Sources say he went from nothing to building a multi-million-dollar company-all in just five years…” 

Every word is a knife. 

He took everything-every shift I worked, every dollar I saved, every piece of myself I gave up-and turned it into his success story? 

Rosalie keeps talking. Smiling. “It was a test, Sloane. A pressure test. To see if Jake could handle real life before taking over the family business.” 

She pauses. 

“And you?” Her eyes sweep across our cramped living room. 

When she looks back at me again, there’s pity. 

“You were just part of the test. Randomly selected. Nothing personal.” 

She tilts her head. “You played the wife really well, though.” 

“But the show’s over now.” 

My phone buzzes after they leave. The screen lights up: JAKE. 

I pick up without thinking. 

His voice cuts through, cold and flat. 

“Sloane. The whole broke-couple thing? It’s done. You made it to the end. But you didn’t pass the test.” 

“Test?” 

“Yeah. Test.” He laughs-short, sharp. “I had to prove to the board I could build something from nothing. That I could find someone loyal enough to stick around through the worst of it. Rosalie bankrolled the whole thing. She’s my real fiancée. You? You were just the stand-in. A random pick to play the wife.” 

My chest tightens. “So the debt… it was all fake?” 

“It was startup capital with a different name. Had to make it sound bad enough to see how you’d react under pressure.” 

My nails dig into my palm. “You’re a piece of shit, Jake.” 

“Maybe.” He doesn’t even flinch. “But this piece of shit just inherited a billion-dollar company. There’s a check on the coffee table. Take it. Sign the papers. Walk away. Don’t embarrass yourself now.” 

Chapter 1 

He pauses. Then he goes for the kill. 

“Oh-and Anson? She’s not yours. Never was. Rosalie and I did IVF years ago. The embryos we made together? They got swapped out before implantation.” 

“You were just watching him for us. Now his actual mom’s back. So pack your stuff and get out. The house belongs to the Sutherlands.” 

His words hit me like ice water. My whole body goes cold. 

Like someone just shoved me into a freezer. 

“Rosalie and the lawyers are already there. They’ll walk you through it. And Sloane?” His voice drops. “Don’t make a scene. Keep it together.” 

The line goes dead. 

I’m still gripping the phone. It feels like it’s burning a hole through my hand. 

Watching her for us. 

That’s all I ever was. A stand-in. A prop in their story. 

And now that the curtain’s down, they’re taking it all back-and throwing me out with the trash. ",1,1766477884.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
