1iulvs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBarcelona/comments/1iulvs9/question_for_baristas/,Question for baristas,"Hi all, I have a question for baristas here regarding milks. I own an American-style bakery in Barcelona and of course coffee culture there is different from here, as well as in the other places I've lived. My goal is to provide the customer with what they want, in both taste and temperature. Sometimes things go a little wrong with that though.

One of my biggest issues is dealing with how customers want their coffee when they ask for leche ""natural"" and/or ""templada.""  It seems like everyone has a different opinion on what that means, and often when I ask them how they want it, they just say to do whatever I normally do. I've asked people before how they want it and they just reply ""Que no me quemes."" That doesn't give me anything to go on unfortunately. It seems like so many of the people here have been burned by over-heated milk at some of these cafeterias that now they don't trust I will make a drink at the correct temp - which to me means holding the steaming pitcher with my hand just until it's too hot to hold.

And then when I prepare a café con leche con la leche natural, I see their faces curl up with disgust at this semi-cold coffee - and only sometimes do they ask for it to be remade. Then there's the whole ""Just put the same drink in the steamer wand for me,"" but I can't do that because of hygiene, so the whole time I'm remaking the drink they're kind of complaining about the waste we're creating. 

Up to now it's been my understanding that a ""café con leche con la leche natural"" means UHT milk that's been sitting out at room temperature. Today I made that for someone - one espresso shot in a 180ml cup, filled with milk that was sitting out at room temp in the unopened container. Well, she started lecturing me that it was too cold and that what she asked for was milk at room temperature (which is what I put), then asked me to steam it up a little bit after she had taken a drink from it, and then was a bit annoyed that I had to remake it instead of just steaming her drink she had already sipped from.

Anyway, any advice would be helpful on this because it's something that comes up all the time. How do you prepare a classic café con leche con la leche natural? And the same question for ""con la leche templada"" and also when they respond with ""Que no me quemes.""  I also heard the other day for the first time ""A temperatura de barista,"" which made me wonder what that means - in that case the guy meant what I would call a normal heat, with my hand on the pitcher just until it's too hot to hold.

**Food & Dining: Where to Eat Near the Hilton Omaha**

A good con experience requires fuel—cosplay, panels, and late-night anime debates all take serious energy. Luckily, Omaha’s got some top-tier spots to keep you going!

If sushi is your love language, Blue Sushi Sake Grill is the place to be. Their rolls are fresh, flavorful, and straight-up addictive, plus their happy hour deals mean you can feast without blowing your budget. More in the mood for a burger?

And let’s not forget breakfast—because a day of con adventures is best started with a full stomach. Lisa’s Radial Café is a classic, no-nonsense breakfast spot serving up hearty pancakes, omelets, and all the morning fuel you need to keep the energy high.

Wherever you decide to eat, one thing’s for sure: you won’t go hungry at Kanpai!Con!

**Room Party Etiquette: How to Be the Life of the Party (Without Getting Kicked Out)**

Kanpai!Con has an active room party scene, and whether you’re hosting or attending, there’s a right way to keep the fun going without getting a knock on the door from hotel security. Here’s how to party smart while making sure everyone has a great time.

**Hosting a Room Party? Read This First!**

First things first—register your party with the con. Kanpai!Con offers an official room party block, which not only helps staff direct guests your way but also keeps things organized and safer for everyone.

Next, control the volume—yes, even if your party is anime-rave-themed. Hotel security doesn’t care how fire your playlist is; if things get too loud, you’ll be shut down fast. A good rule of thumb? If you have to shout to be heard, it’s probably too loud.

And most importantly, be inclusive! Whether you’re running an 18+ drink-friendly gathering, a wholesome anime marathon, or a niche fandom meet-up, make sure everyone who fits the vibe feels welcome. Clear signage at the door helps set expectations.

**Attending a Room Party? Know the Code!**

If you’re hopping from room to room, respect the host’s rules. Some parties are 18+, some are cosplay-only, and some might have a sign saying “BYOB” (or “No BYOB”). Don’t assume—ask!

Also, don’t be that guy. You know, the one who spills a drink on someone’s handmade costume, breaks the hotel lamp, or passes out in a corner. Pace yourself and respect the space.

And finally, know when to call it a night. The con doesn’t stop for hangovers or sleep deprivation. Don’t wreck yourself before the final day—there’s still plenty of fun left to be had! Party on—responsibly!

**Final Tips for Surviving Kanpai!Con**

Kanpai!Con is an [action-packed weekend](https://kanpaicon.com/events) full of cosplay, panels, gaming, and nonstop fun. To make sure you get the most out of it (and don’t end up exhausted or unprepared), here are some key survival tips to keep in mind!

✔**Get Your Ticket Early**

Kanpai!Con grows every year, and badge sales reflect that. Prices often go up closer to the event, and some badge types sell out entirely. [Lock in your spot](https://kanpaicon.com/register) as soon as possible so you’re not scrambling at the last minute.

✔**Stay Hydrated & Take Care of Yourself**

Between dancing at the rave, chasing down voice actors for autographs, and dashing between panels, dehydration sneaks up fast. Carry a refillable water bottle and actually *use it*. Bonus tip: Pack some snacks to avoid running purely on Pocky and energy drinks.

✔**Budget for Merch—You** ***Will*** **Want Something**

The Exhibit Hall and Artist Alley will tempt you at every turn, whether it’s exclusive con merch, rare anime figures, or handmade accessories that perfectly complete your cosplay. Set a budget before you go, and if possible, bring some cash—some artists and vendors may not take cards.

✔**Pack a Cosplay Emergency Kit**

Cosplay malfunctions happen at the worst times—think zippers breaking, wigs shifting, or props losing a piece mid-photo op. Pack a small repair kit with safety pins, fashion tape, hot glue, a sewing kit, and duct tape. A little prep can save your whole look!

✔**Put Yourself Out There & Make New Friends**

Kanpai!Con is all about community, and some of the best con memories come from spontaneous conversations with fellow fans. Whether you’re in a panel, waiting in line, or attending a room party, don’t be afraid to strike up a chat—you never know when you’ll meet your new best friend or future cosplay group member.

**See You at Kanpai!Con 2025!**

Get ready for an unforgettable weekend of anime, cosplay, and non-stop fun at Kanpai!Con 2025! Whether you’re a first-timer or a con veteran, this year’s event is shaping up to be *incredible.*

I’m writing really hoping one of the developers follows this group. I bought my kids this amazing game for Christmas but have been away on a construction project for 6 weeks. I finally got home and we got to the first campaign quest and I spilled a full cup of coffee all over the table ruining a lot of the cardboard pieces and about 20 cards. The kids are super upset and I feel completely terrible about it. The cards are completely warped but the cardboard is worse because the liquid made the thick cardboard separate from its back side. 

I have looked online but cannot find anywhere to replace individual pieces. I ruined:

- half the card deck
- the dread tracker
- 3 character boards
- 3 class boards
- the enemy info board

Anyone have tips for repairing this kind of damage. If the developers are listening is there any way I can purchase replacement pieces from you guys?

If altering timelines actually worked like that, then Nora's life would be normal, meaning the OG timeline would return. But it doesn't; it changes everything, even so much that Thawne doesn't know what happens in this mess of a timeline. 
It would make no sense for Barry to not be able to recorrect the timeline similar to how he did for flashpoint and after Armageddon (reverse flashpoint).

As we saw in Reverse Flashpoint, you can undo different events, as Barry showed by fixing Thawne's mess. But also, in Flashpoint, Barry SAVED HIS MOTHER, which should've fixed the original timeline. Jay explains that if you try to fix something broken, it won't be exactly the same. But as the N52 showed, most things would be the same, with a few changes that wouldn't affect too much. This was later shown when Barry let his mother die again, yet even though he saved his mother, Wally, Joe, Iris, Barry, and Cisco all changed way too much.

Thawne would've had no way to create a new timeline, as shown with Reverse Flashpoint and Flashpoint. Even that just couldn't change that night, as in the end, it had to reset again to that point. Yet, both Thawne and Barry created new histories which should've worked like we're talking about the OG people creating this new Flashpoint, yet that didn't happen because, as shown in the other two Flashpoints, they will always be undone.

In the past few months, I've been trying to refrain from commenting on Tripoli's central square aka martyrs square - but to no avail.

Alas the time has come.

We're gonna overlook the restoration costs since there's just about zero transparency anyway; in how state funds are being allocated.

Therefore we're just gonna focus on what's been delivered; a dancing fountain, an abstract gallow and a concert stage.

First things first; who came up with the idea anyway ?!? 
Its just dumb and a dancing fountain lost its WOW effect sometime last decade at the Dubai Mall water show ....

If you're gonna copy and paste from Dubai; might as-well nitpick something more recent & decent - in the sense that the water show in Dubai is choreographed with crystal clear music and the overall size and setting ( especially at sunset ) does carry a WOW effect or at least the first time you see it.  Not to mention that the water splashing back into the immense pool / lagoon, does provide some kind of refreshing feeling to the arid atmosphere while sitting outside at one of the numerous fancy coffee shops etc.  
Taking a selfie with the fountain background does make for a memorable moment in time.

Does the Libyan version deliver a fraction of the Dubai fountain ?  You must be drunk.

The Libyan dancing fountain has just been inaugurated and videos online already started to document its crumbling state. 

That's your WOW effect.

Next up is the concert stage right next to Tripoli's UNESCO museum and the city's historical focal point and bastion of past rulers etc.  

In one word; you can't just place a high tech concert stage next to an ancient castle of historical and architectural importance to the city and country as a whole. 

The Saraya castle is by far the only beautiful building this country has ever had. 

The point is, slapping high tech concert stages next to ancient buildings is just a sore eye and totally tasteless. 

Moving on the the abstract gallows; its just pure genius. 

A concrete rectangle in one of the square's corners is Libya's artistic expression to commemorate the fallen martyrs during the Italian colonial period between 1911 and 1934 circa.

Why not dedicate some other downtown square to the martyrs ? Why have concerts ( if ever ) and dancing fountains all squeezed together with martyrs and ancient castles ? 

It just makes you go wtf.

The fact that Libyans resisted foreign occupation is awesome considering what they had at the time - a few rifles and moltov cocktails on horse back fighting guys on tanks with machine guns.

Besides being massacred by the Fascist regime; Libyan martyrs weren't not able to change anything on the ground and the end of WW2 is what stopped the resistance with the fall of Nazi Germany. 

Those martyrs showed a level of bravery equal to sure death against the enemy and deserve a square of their own right; commemorated by an artistic expression of hope, solidarity, prosperity and most of all LIFE.

So, there you have it; a crumbling dancing fountain from day one, a concert stage with no concerts or parties or international artists etc and a concret gallow.  

The level of planning behind all this must be equal to a few fools meeting at a cheap coffee shop getting ready to go home for lunch.

I have a profile sa Facebook dating. And I believe that it is created for dating, for getting to know each other but mainly, most likely, to find someone to love. 

Yesterday, I decided to meet someone sa SM North. I decided to agree because first, it is a public place and second, it's for coffee so tingin ko, this looks like very decent dating naman. Before, if I do meet up, they're expecting something more than just a date kaya di ako tumutuloy. I even got excited 🙄 Kaya I dressed up nicely, I even booked para kako di ma-late. 

Pagpunta ko dun, andun na sya. Now, he started asking questions. Taga saan ako, saan ang province ko and my parents, what is my work and saan ako nagwowork, etc. Akala nya siguro is hindi ko napapansin, alam kong those questions are okay pero I am noticing na palabas kami ng SM North so I asked him where are we going. He said we'll have coffee daw and pointing towards the Southbound side ng edsa, sa side ng Savemore, I said okay and continue to follow him.

Now, I dont know but ung mga building na may networking stuff? They have this look, this image na napakaraming tao sa baba ng bldg and sa labas, kaya nung nakita ko na dun kami papunta, nag alangan nako and asked him again, sabi nya may coffee shop daw sa taas so okay, gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

Nung nasa may elevator na kami, I asked him the name of the coffee shop and he said Premier. That's already the red flag, I already started seeing red. 🚨 The reason why is I believe I was supposed to meet a guy asking me to meet at the same coffee shop with the same name. I tried to search the coffee shop name before and it's not showing up on any maps. But I stayed quiet and waited for the elevator to reach the designated floor.

Pagbukas ng elevator, tumambad sa akin ang lobby where may mga parang isang pamilya sila taking a photo with what I believe was the host. Then I turn to my left and there I saw UNO. Like wtf? Umaakyat ng ung dugo sa utak ko and this guy started guiding me to what it looks like a hall or an audio visual room similar to the audio visual rooms nung elementary and high school days ko. 

Napamura nako. I asked him, WHERE ARE WE GOING? Kasi alam ko na e. Pero ang guy, coffee then we'll talk. Wtf. Tapos nung tinanong ko sya nun, he decided to point me where the coffee shop is. But I've had enough, I still ask him nicely but I don't like the vibes and if I can go out instead but if you are sensitive you know that there is already something in my tone of voice. Andun na ung gigil, like kung hindi ako bababa, makakapagsalita ako ng hindi masama. Allergic ako sa mga networking bs and all. I fcking swear. 

Right after we went down, I told him I can manage I can go back to SM North alone and without his help. 

- If you want to invite people to those networking stuff, please exclude Facebook dating or any dating apps for that matter from your mode of resources. It is for dating, not for your networking. Kainis!

It was a packed house. A raffle system was used for its 30-minute Q&A portion. In the end, around 10 individuals were randomly selected to have their questions heard. 

All but two individuals pressed Jay on grievances with the Trump administration. His answers varied but he was mostly unable to produce any criticism of the current administration, aside from admission that he believed that Trump legitimately lost the 2020 election and that he disagrees with Trump's comments on Ukraine. 

## On DOGE

Jay supports DOGE's goals wholeheartedly. He spent several minutes defending Elon Musk's initiative, remarking on how the billionaire was ""sleeping on the floor"" to solve problems of alleged waste. He then began to enumerate all the alleged wasteful spending reported by documented pathological liar, Elon Musk.

He downplayed executive overreach and believed that the courts would sort out any Constitutional concerns, conveniently ignoring comments from the Trump administration over the past several week to ""ignore the courts.""

## Cuts to Medicaid

Jay neither confirmed nor denied that he supports cuts to Medicaid, though he spent a spent roughly a minute defending the need to target wasteful spending, when asked about Medicaid cuts specifically.

## On CA Fires

Jay talked at length about the need to incorporate advanced technology, including the use of ""water carrying"" drones and low-earth satellite data backed by AI to fight fires more effectively. He conveniently failed to mention that there is only one company with the capabilities to provide low-earth satellite data, and it coincidentally is run by a raging lunatic, otherwise known as Elon Musk. 

## On Trump's Foreign Policy 

When pressed about Trump's rhetoric that was alienating NATO allies, Jay indicated he believed that Trump's methods were ""unconventional but effective.""

## Misc

Jay really likes talking about his degrees and committee assignments.

## The Crowd 

The overall air of the crowd was hostile. Some vocal Trump supporters peppered the room, with occasional cheering, but boos and audible discontent were frequent.

## Final Thoughts

I am not a storyteller and im sorry for the word vomit. 

This starts back in like June/August 2024. Me (23F), my bf (28m), and our two children (5y and 9m) were living 2400 miles away from our friends and family. We had my bfs teen sister come and stay with us for a month over the summer. While she was there she put on this facade that she was this helpless poor teenager with nothing and nobody. And to some degree, it’s true, her parents are fucked. Her dad’s not in the picture, her mom’s a raging alcoholic. In the past few years she’s bounced around from living with mom, her sister, friends, and her grandparents. She told us all of these sob stories about her life, and I fell for it. So once she left I had a talk with bf about moving back to give her structure and stability for the last couple years of high school. He agreed with me wholeheartedly. Now, before we welcomed her to stay with us, we were speculating moving home due to my grandma being in bad health.  But it was up in the air as we didn’t have much saved and we thought we had longer than we did with her. Anyways, we were able to save enough to move ourselves and a good amount of our belongings back across the country 2400miles to show up for this girl. 

Now that we’ve had her since October, my life has been sort of a nightmare. 

I fully expected that things would be hard at times. But I was not expecting it to get to the point of me wanting her out. 

Some of the things we deal with since taking her in have been typical teen stuff like, not wanting to do the chores we ask of her, or being messy in general, or having an attitude. Etc etc
I feel guilty because we were only able to get a 2bed/1bath apartment, meaning we converted a portion of our living room into a space for her. It’s not ideal but she’s got a room divider, a bed, some drawer shelves for storage, she has the entire hallways closet where I put up a tension rod, she has drawers and half of the the bathroom counter. I’ve done my absolute best to give her what we can, and make her feel at home. 

I want to say, we do not have high expectations of her here. She has no household chores that she’s solely responsible for. The only two things I ask of her is to keep her space cleaned up and to wipe the counter down after she’s done with makeup/hair. It’s been 5 months and there’s not been a single time that she’s done those things without being asked. 

I expected there to be drama with boys and friends. I didn’t expect that she’d have 4 separate boyfriends and a pregnancy scare within the first two months of having her. She is now on birth control, per her own decision, she asked me so I helped her navigate the process. 

I expected the teenage angst, but I didn’t expect her to be so flat out disrespectful of me. There have been a million small things that have happened and had to have huge sit down talks about, and some are honestly too vile to even share out loud on here. But some things that feel personal, are her using my personal care stuff. Like razors and loofas. If we hadn’t been providing her with these things I wouldn’t have been offended yall. It was a gentle convo the first time. She has a pack of like 12 razors and another pack of 4. She has FIVE in the shower. I keep one in the shower on the opposite side. It’s not just the razor but my makeup, my perfume, my stuff. I’ve been so willing to share just about everything but there’s certain ones im just not comfortable. Mascara is one. I have sensitive ass eyes and I’ve never been okay with swapping eyeliner or mascara. 

Another issue is how rude she is to my son. If she has a hard day, she’s a relentless b****. He will excitedly welcome her at the door and she has yelled at him to leave her alone. My bf laid into about that, but it still happens here and there. 

We have dished out thousands of dollars on taking her in, but im coming to find out she never really needed the help. She has everyone sending her money and food and buying her whatever she needs. The only thing she doesn’t have is the stability of being in one place. I know how crucial that is for a kid which is why I stepped up in the first place but this shits reallly getting to me. 

I seriously do not ask much, especially from her. But one other “rule” in the house is just like common fucking courtesy. Idk that’s what my mom taught it to us as. Basically, if you take the last of something, let parent know, or replace jt. Ex: if she takes the last bottled were from the fridge, please replace it. Or another example: if you fill the trash can, take it out. 
If you make a mess, you clean it up. 

I’m sicker than hell today, after two weeks of sick kids. And she has depleted the water from the fridge every single time I’ve filled it today. It’s easier to brush off when im not sick and exhausted and needing a cold water. 

Ever since having my second child, my body is not the same. When I need to pee, I don’t have long to hold it. So especially first thing in the am, it’s a race to the bathroom. SIL has a horrible habit of keeping her earbuds in while she’s doing hair or makeup or in the phone in the bathroom. It was like 5:30 am and I had to pee. I was knocking for ten minutes while doing the fuckin potty dance. I tried banging and calling her name as it got more urgent. She didn’t hear me, I ended up pissing myself. It was humiliating and degrading. This was the first time it got that bad but she’s had this issue for the entire time she’s been here and there have been too many close calls..

I have tried putting reminders up, little cutesy notes with hearts. One in the bathroom, “please don’t use my personal care stuff without asking, im happy to share most things but please ask first”.
Another on the fridge, “please replace the water you take with another” 
Another in the bathroom saying that there’s a 20~ min time limit for the bathroom. 
These notes have done nothing. She has continued to use my razors and everything else I’ve asked her not to, for 5 months now. 
I have moved all of my bathroom belongings to my bedroom dresser. I feel like a guest in my own home. 

So her space is in the living room. I do my best to keep the kiddos quiet on days she’s not in school. I try to let her sleep in a little. I will crack the blinds but don’t usually turn lights on until 9 on weekends. 
She will get right back up and turn off the light where my kids are trying to play. 
It’s sort of infuriating because I’ll walk away for one minute to make coffee and come back and my baby is sitting in her pack and play in the dark. Not cool. She’ll do this in the middle of the day too. The afternoon, evening, whenever she feels like it. 

She wanted to do the wrestling team at her high school this year, and so we paid hundreds to make that happen. Turns out my uncle is her coach. Rad right? Except for the part she’d be skipping practice. 

Let me explain also, we live 30 minutes away from her school. My bf works an hr away from our home. So she’s on the way to his work. No big deal in dropping her off on the way, but some days he gets off earlier than her practices get out. So he or I will end up making another trip just to go pick her up, usually right at dinner time. So when she was lying to us saying she had practice, we’re spending hella gas going back and forth thinking we’re supporting her extra curriculars. 

A big issue we’re having is how she dresses at home. She’s always wearing the MOST revealing clothes. I’m by no means a conservative or anything close, but I do believe in having decency. In a shared space with children. She more often than not lounges in positions that are indecent and exposing everythinggg. 


My family included SIL in our holiday celebrations. She got gifts and went to our parties. Yet when my aunt, the one whose house she’d been to multiple times and who gave her helllla gifts, showed up to see her brother (my uncle, SILs coach) on his birthday, she pretended to not remember her at all. It was humiliating and sad all at the same time. 

Anyways, there are far more things and worse incidents that have gone on that just make me want to give up all together here. I feel defeated, I feel like a doormat. I feel like our entire schedule revolves around her and her schooling,sports, friends, and dating. 
My feelings are so conflicting because on one hand shes had it rough. But on another, so have a lot of us and I never behaved half as badly as the way she does. 

I want to spare my older child the confusion that her being here has already brought. I want to be able to focus on my children and being parents to them. AITAH for being ready to send her back to her mother?

1iulik1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iulik1/four_options_confused_on_which_path_to_take/,Four options. Confused on which path to take.,"I am in need of some advice.  I know this is a long post.  At the very least, I hope you find it entertaining.  Here is my story...


The Ex:

About a year ago, I got out of a five year long relationship with the person I thought I was going to marry.  I loved her very much, but she got a new job in sales working 50 hours per week and when she would come home, she would just eat and go to sleep.  On weekends, she would spend time getting ahead of her workload for the week and didn't have time for cuddling, fun activities, or any kind of quality time.  She was not spending time with friends either, but just working and sleeping.  

For the last year of our relationship, the sex became very infrequent.  We'd do it once month at most.  When we did have sex, the passion had gone and it seemed like it was a chore for her.  I talked to her about it and she said I was great in bed, but she was too tired to be into it from working all the time.  I had multiple discussions about my unhappiness since she started the new job, as my needs in the relationship were no longer being met.  Though I suggested many solutions, she refused to make any compromise and we decided to part ways.  I was heartbroken.  I loved this woman, but we slowly drifted apart.  How could I be in a relationship with someone I barely spent time with?


The Colleague:

Now, one year after the breakup, my friends suggested I start dating again.  I work in public relations for a really good company.  At my job, there was this woman who always thought I was great and wanted to go out with me, but I didn't do it because I wasn't over my ex yet and I thought it would be strange to date a colleague.  She was persistent.

Finally, I agreed.  We went on three super amazing dates.  Our understanding of each other bordered on telepathy.  We had a crazy strong connection and she was gorgeous.  She then sent me over 100 rapid fire texts throughout the week, some of which were very flirtatious and sexual.  I didn't mind, as I really liked her, but I thought it maybe was a red flag.  I'd reply as often as I could, but out of nowhere, the messages stopped.  When I tried contacting her, I received no reply.  It was all very sudden.  She went from full-on obsession to ghost mode.  A week later, she told me she doesn't feel comfortable being in a relationship and would rather be friends.  I was confused, but respected her wishes and agreed to just be friends.  Unfortunately, I still think she is awesome, but I suspect she has a disorganized attachment style, which is very difficult to handle.  If not for that, I'd still be trying for a real relationship with her.  For a minute, it felt almost too perfect.  Very twin-flame.  She still flirts with me occasionally at work, but we always go our separate ways.


The Brain:

A few weeks after, I began dating a lovely woman I met in a coffee shop.  She works for another company in IT.  She is fun, nerdy, and intelligent.  We share stories of world history, science, and comic books (I'm into these things as well).  We've been together for four months now, seeing each other about three times per week.  

We had an awesome Valentine's Day.  I took her to the symphony and we went for a romantic dinner at an aquarium in an underwater tunnel.  The tropical fish swam around us while we dined and had great conversations.  There is one problem.  She just recently told me she is very religious and doesn't want to have sex until marriage.  Keep in mind that I'm 38yrs old and she is 33yrs.  At this point in my life, I want a healthy sex life.  We talked about it, but I don't think she will change her mind.  I have to respect that.  We are still dating, but here is where things get really interesting...


The Wild Card:

Out of nowhere, my original ex that works 50 hours a week calls me and tells me she wants me back!  She says she still loves me and misses me.  I told her I'm dating someone else and I don't cheat, so that won't be happening while I'm in another relationship.  Furthermore, she got promoted and now works even more.  I don't see it working out when she still won't have time to spend with me.  It still hurts my heart because part of me still loves her.


TL;DR:  I need some advice.  Here are my options as far as I can see it:

Option 1:  Stay with The Brain and enjoy her time and personality, but have no sex life.  She is otherwise fantastic, but I'll probably get sexually frustrated.

Option 2:  Go back to The Ex and have an intermittent sex life, but hardly get to spend time with her.  I'll probably still have a tough time with her workaholic lifestyle.

Option 3:  Pursue a relationship with The Colleague, probably have a great sex life, enjoy the twin-flame, but risk that it could go really bad since she has a disorganized attachment style and I have to work with her.

Option 4:  Return to the dating pool and keep searching for love.

Please help me decide!


*Disclaimer:  I know I mention sex in these options a lot.  That is most definitely not the only aspect of a relationship I'm interested in.  There has to be an emotional connection, intelligence, and aligning values.  I despise hooking up and want a real relationship.",1,1740123683.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

1iulb4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iulb4b/i_15f_wrote_my_older_crush_16m_a_400word_letter/,I (15F) wrote my older crush (16M) a 400-word letter about how much I admire him. He says he wants to ‘keep talking’—is that romantic or just friendly? Advice!,"I’m 15 (turning 16 soon), and there’s a junior at my high school (he’s 16 turning 17) who has caused me to fall head over heels for the first time in my life. We got to know each other through an after-school club, and I was drawn in by how hardworking, kind, and genuinely enthusiastic he is about almost everything. He has this child-like excitement over the smallest things, and I’ve found it impossible not to smile when he does. He also has this sweet, slightly shy side, and tends to get flustered when people tease him, which is all the more endearing to me.

Recently, my school had a tradition where students can write letters to people they appreciate, tied to a broader Valentine’s theme. I ended up writing him a pretty long message—around 400 words—where I talked about how much I admire his dedication, positivity, and the fact that he just makes everyone’s day brighter by being himself. I didn’t explicitly say, “I have a crush on you,” but I did gush about how great I think he is. On one hand, I want him to understand that I see him as more than a casual friend, but on the other, I’m not sure if he’ll pick up on that.

He hasn’t mentioned reading it yet, and I’m torn about what to do next. However, we are on a break this week, so there's a chance he left his letters at school accidentally at the end of last week. Part of me hopes he’ll bring it up, which might open the door for a deeper conversation (though at the same time, I would never be able the be the initiator of anything relationship related, simply due to my absolutely crushing fear of rejection). Another part of me wonders if I should be more direct, like inviting him to hang out one-on-one or at least letting him know that I’d be interested in getting to know him beyond the club setting. But because there’s a grade difference—he’s a junior, I’m a freshman—I’m worried about how people might perceive it. It’s only about a year and a half in actual age, but in high school, these things can feel bigger.

In the gratitude note he left me he said that this year he got to know me better as a friend, enjoyed our talks, and that he wanted to continue talking as there was a lot more of me to get to know (was this a friendzone, or is this leading, or is it neutral???? I’m so lost). 

I’m also scared about making things awkward in our club if he doesn’t feel the same way. We see each other regularly, and I don’t want to create tension or make him uncomfortable. At the same time, these feelings are really strong for me (stronger than anything I’ve felt before), so I don’t think I can sit on them forever—if you ask my friends who I’ve told, it's obvious how much I’m attracted and swooned by everything about him, based on the way I talk about him.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation, I’d love some guidance on what the best “next steps” might be. Should I wait for him to respond to my letter and keep things friendly until I sense a clear sign of interest? Or should I find a casual way to ask him to hang out—like studying together or grabbing coffee—so I can gauge if there’s any spark on his side? If I should, how do I even go about doing that? I’ve never been the one to initiate a hang out, even with my friends (but they KNOW that I am incredibly anxious when asking, and that I will always say yes if they ask). How can I go about gauging his interest? If he is interested, how can I show that I am interested without being the one to really ask him on a first date? (another tidbit of info, he’s never been in a relationship before, so he wouldn’t know anything about this type of stuff either). Any advice, especially from people who’ve dealt with a slight grade gap and those intense early crush feelings, would be so appreciated. Thank you!

1iulaac,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1iulaac/she_called_me_today_on_my_birthday/,She called me today on my birthday,"Backstory: Her (F31) and I (M35) shared a very intense 1 year relationship. We were both 1 year away from difficult long term relationships, had had issues at work (she was on mental health leave, I was not full time yet). We kind of became codependent in a way. We spent every moment together, went on crazy adventures travelling and hiking and just constantly cuddled and enjoyed our time together. She seemed very happy with how things were progressing. 

I have a daughter from a previous relationship. She was ok with this as long as I wanted to start a family with me within a few years. I agreed. But she was extremely jealous of my ex. I am not in love with my ex at all whatsoever, but I understand why it hurts when you're dating someone with a child, and sometimes co-parenting situations arise where the two parents have to be somewhere, and she could not trust me to even be in the presence of my ex for the sake of my daughter. She had previously been cheated on, but I gave her zero reason not to trust me and she gave me an ultimatum. I went to a family dinner which included my ex (for the sake of my daughter) and she ended things then and there over the phone, went fully no contact, blocking and deleting me everywhere, 3 days before Christmas. It was very very difficult for me mental health wise, but I bear no ill will towards her. I understand how difficult and complex the situation is for her.

Anyways fast forward to today. I was at a bar watching the Canada-usa hockey game (we live in Vancouver). She calls me out of the blue, 2 months after not hearing from her at all. She said ""I just can't stop thinking about you today because it's your birthday.""

Im trying to act non-chalant but I'm very shocked. I didn't think I would hear from this woman again. I told her everything I've been doing in order to not get depressed (I've been doing a lot). Skiing, quit vaping, lost weight, got a new place, doing a pushups challenge ect. She seemed very happy and supportive. 

Coincidencly to our breakup, a few days after Christmas her very ill grandma passed away, so I offered my condolences again (I had sent a card) and she said it had been a struggle. the situation that caused our breakup came up. I could hear the anger in her voice. I could still tell that she wasn't over it. She doesn't want to get back together and neither do I, we both recognize that we wanted different things from the relationship (I wasn't truly ready to move in and have more children, even if I thought I was)

Anyway. I still have some of her stuff. A custom blanket I had made for her for xmas that was delivered late. We made plans for coffee and so that I can give it to her. 

What do you guys think? I have very mixed emotions. I still have a lot of feelings for her, but she also hurt me very badly by pulling the rug out from under me. Today really opened the wound I didn't expect it at all. I still think we aren't right for each other. But now I'm back in the spin cycle.",1,1740122687.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1iula1j,https://i.redd.it/63zw46m22gke1.png,Is this related to Witchcraft?,"Hey, I found this metal mint container filled with what I assume is coffee based on the smell, though I'm not entirely sure what it is.

In my house, only my parents and I live here. Besides them, the only person who enters my room is the cleaning lady, who is Haitian. I mention her nationality because, as far as I know, witchcraft is commonly practiced there.

I honestly have no idea if this has anything to do with witchcraft or something else. I should mention that I don’t really believe in this (mainly because I haven't had any experience before), but for some reason, it reminded me of the ""hex bags"" that witches used in the show Supernatural 😅(sorry if that sound stupid but somehow I thought about it). Besides, it’s really strange because neither my parents nor I have any clue how it got there or why someone would fill this container with ""coffee"" (if it even is coffee).

1iul9g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iul9g9/aita_for_not_enjoying_every_part_of_my_paidfor/,AITA for not enjoying every part of my paid-for Hawaii trip?,"Hi, I’m writing this at home two days after coming back from a vacation in Kauai.

I, (20M), was invited to come on my friend’s (49M) 50th birthday trip to Hawaii. We’ll call him Dave.

I met him a little over a year ago, we started as FWB, but now we’re just pretty close friends. Dave works in tech and makes a lot from it. I’m a working full-time college student, who does not have funds to spread around. 

In October 2024, Dave invited me to go with him and his two partners (35M,50M) for a president’s day weekend trip to Kauai. I’d stay till Tuesday (because of work and school), then him and his partners would go to the big island for another week. November he sent me first class tickets there to Hawaii and back home. And said that they’d be paying for the hotel too.

This was my first time going on a big trip like this. But this was a regular thing for my friends. They said they go to Hawaii usually twice a year.

We arrive there really late at night Friday, and just drove to the hotel, dropped our stuff off, and the three went to the grocery store across the street to stock up on stuff. I just went to bed.

Saturday came and I woke up really early compared to the three of them. I got up and ready by 7am, went across the street to get coffee and back to the hotel to sit by the pool and look at the beach. I realized I didn’t have our room code so I texted asking what it was. They got up around 11:30am, and we started our morning by picking up their friend who lives on the island, and going to a local farmers market. We had some good bites and got a lot of food there, and their friend was super sweet to be with. We got back to the hotel around 1am, and spent the next couple hours at the pool and beach. I was having a really awesome time.

Dave prior to the trip told me about this ukulele player that performs at the hotel’s oceanfront restaurant every Wednesday. He said it’s one of his favorite things to go see, and that he was sad that I couldn’t see him since I left the day before. It turns out that the Saturday we were there, it was the restaurant’s 15th anniversary that day, and that the ukulele player would be there to perform instead of his usual Wednesday slot. We were all excited to now be able to see him.

At 4pm we were able to go and sit at the bar of the already fully booked restaurant, with a really nice ocean view. The restaurant was really expensive, so we didn’t order any entrees, but had drinks. I had one shirley temple, and my three friends ended up having two drinks each. The chairs at the bar were really uncomfortable, and after 30 minutes of sitting I was having a hard time. I was not getting any reception or wifi on my phone, so I was fully tuned in to everything around me.

The ukulele performer came out, and it was a lovely experience. The view was great, he had a nice voice, and could really play the ukulele. This ended up being a 2 hour long performance, where he mostly played song requests. After the first hour, I couldn’t really hold a happy face anymore. I was sitting uncomfortable, hungry, sober, and didn’t have my phone to give a second distraction. I was and looked bored, but I still really did like the performer and was glad I got to see it. After the show, I told one of his partners that it went on longer than I thought, and he agreed with me. But I did tell them all I liked it, and we went to get food from a different restaurant they liked.

Sunday we explored more of the island, and it was my favorite day there. I had the most fun and I think it really showed. Monday was another great day of exploring, and meeting more of the friends on the island.

We had actually gotten the day I was leaving mixed up, and thought that I was supposed to leave Monday night instead of Tuesday night. It wasn’t until that it was around 9-10pm, I had already packed up and dressed for the airport, that we found out that we got the dates wrong and I was there for another day. 

Mentally at that point I was checked out for the night, and was really shocked that we got the dates wrong and I was there for an extra day than planned. So when finding that out, I didn’t have a complete look of happiness and joy. More just exhaustion and confusion. Dave then immediately asked what I wanted to do tomorrow. I said that I really had gotten all I had wanted out of this trip, and more. That I was really happy with everything we’ve done and kind of wanted to relax at the pool for the last day I was here. It seemed like the three of them kind of understood, especially because I knew they all had individual plans made for the next day too. I left to go to bed and probably fell asleep by 10:30.

I woke up the next morning at 9am, to a text message sent at midnight from Dave. It read: 

“This is MY 50th bday trip. l asked what you wanted to do tomorrow and you said you just wanted to stay at the hotel. I was texting about this with Stan and Mark and they said, ""wait, it's your birthday?!?!?!"" You have behaved horribly on this trip. I've tried to cut you some slack because I know you've never traveled and are out of your depth but come on. You have been incredibly entitled and selfish and ruined my birthday. Honestly, if you can't sit through a two hour ukulele concert without getting bored and freaking out because you don't have internet access, you need to make some serious personal growth. The sad thing is that I was really going above and beyond to try and make the trip something fun for you. This island means a lot to me and I was excited to share it with you. I feel completely unvalued and disrespected. You have really hurt my feelings and I really regret trying to share this special place with you.”
(Stan and Mark are the two friends dog-sitting for the three back home)

I didn’t believe that he wrote of that to me, and felt blindsided by it. Dave texted this to me when I was sleeping in the same hotel room like 30 feet away from him. I really did not understand why he decided to text this instead of wanting to talk face-to-face.

I texted him back at 9am immediately asking if he was awake, and that we talk about this. I didn’t get a text back till 10:15am, saying he’s awake.

I decided I didn’t want to come out and talk till both of his partners were also awake. One of his partners came by my room and said good morning and asked how I’m doing. I just started tearing up and showed him the text message. He clearly didn’t know I was sent that and didn’t know about this. He texted me after leaving my room “Me neither. I thought we were all having a good time. It didn’t feel to me like you were being ungrateful. I also thought you enjoyed the concert. - Yeah I don’t know where this is coming from”

Once I heard the last person was awake, I walked into the living room of the hotel where all three of them were and just let out my emotions. I said how much I have enjoyed this trip, and it was so special. How this doesn’t happen to people like me often, and I thought I was showing how grateful I was being. I went over the different days together and what I said to all three of them about the great time I was having. Telling Dave about how hurt I was that he decided to text this to me instead of wanting to talk to me about it. And apologized to him of anything I did that came across as ungrateful or to ruin any experience.

Dave didn’t say a lot back. He said he was hurt that I looked uninterested at the ukulele performance, and that after finding out that I was going to be here an extra day, I didn’t look happy. I apologized to him, and tried to explain that I was having a good time, and that I don’t always show my emotions visibly. I said that I’ve told each three of them multiple times throughout the trip how happy I was to be there with them, and his two partners did say together that they didn’t feel as if I was being ungrateful.

The talk ended in a hug through only me crying. Dave never apologized for anything he said in the text, and it was not talked about for the rest of the day.

The rest of the day was a fun time. We went and got breakfast, then they went to do individual plans they had for the afternoon. I spent the time at the pool and mostly being alone. I put on a happy face and we went all together to a beach far from the hotel to see the sunset, and it was really pretty. Night came, we got dinner, I packed up my stuff, and we all drove to the airport to drop me off.

On the ride there, Dave asked if I was nervous about the flight. I said kind of, but that I was pretty mentally checked out. That my feelings are still raw and hurt from that morning. One of his partners said that was valid, and we should pick this back up when they get back from the rest of the trip. Dave didn’t say anything for the rest of the car ride there.

At the airport, Dave’s two partners gave me a big hug goodbye, and thanked me for coming with them. Dave gave me the weakest and quickest hug ever, the complete opposite of how he usually gives hugs.

They left and I went to my gate to wait to board. While waiting I texted the partner that said we should talk about it when they get back. I said Dave gave me a really weak hug, and it seemed like he didn’t want to see me again. His partner texted back saying that he has been spiraling even before the trip began, and that it seemed I was bearing the brunt of it right now.

I told him thank you for having me, and that it was a great time together. He said that he didn’t think I did anything wrong, and that night he tried to convince Dave of that, but it got out of hand and felt that he was turning on Dave.

We said good night, and we’ll talk to each other later.

I got home then on Wednesday morning, and told friends and family about my trip. The good and bad. Dave then texted me in the afternoon how my flight was. I didn’t text him back till night, saying it was good, and that we shouldn’t talk till in person. That this isn’t resolved and I need time.

He said he’ll respect my wishes. I texted back happy birthday, and left it there.

Today he texted me talking about a crazy experience getting a rental car. I’m not responding to it. It seems like he just wants to forget what happened, but I feel like I shouldn’t have to forget this because it seems he doesn’t want to talk about.

I don’t know what to do now. Either way, if we make up or not, I’m withdrawing a bit from him now. I don’t think what he said was right to say, and the way he communicated it was immature. That he should take responsibility in what he said, and apologize to me as well.

Thank you for reading.

My brother is getting married this summer in'sha'Allah. I truly want the best for him but this matter has made me feel upset. I realise this post may be very dramatic but I honestly can't help it.

I have always depended on my brother for everything. He drives me so I don't have to use public transport, returns my parcels for me, watches shows with me, advices me when needed and so much more Alhamdullilah. I'm super grateful for his presence in my life and cant even come close to repaying him. However he's moving abroad to be with his wife and I'm having major anxiety about it.

Depending on myself even for small daily errands is super scary. I haven't used the train/bus alone in my whole life, I haven't ever gone into coffee shops, grocery shopping, appointments alone. Having to 'adult' especially in a western country which isn't too kind towards visibly muslim women terrifying to me. My father goes abroad often and doesn't feel like I need protecting 24/7. Whenever I bring up my anxiety surrounding this my family jokingly mention marriage. They aren't being serious about it though, as they've rejected every possible match for me. I haven't even met a potential in person or online as my family has never given anyone a chance.

I am practically stuck. Getting married before my brother would've been ideal but I'm putting my trust in Allah. How do I become more independent? Is there a way I can combat my anxiety and leave the house more often? Anyone deal with anything similar? Any advice would be great. Jazakallah khair.",1,1740122502.0,MuslimNikah,2,1.0,False

The Great War it's being called, entire nations hellbent on ripping each other apart. One side call themselves the Trinity Allegiance, comprised of The Human country of Bravia, the Elvish kingdom, and the Dwarven Underthrows. The other side has taken the name, The Colaboration of Arrafran, made up by Arrafran and his kingdom, the Orc tribes, the Goblin empire of Jeneu, and our glorious nation, The Kobold country of Krudallia. The Warlock king Arrafran has had us and the Goblins at the front lines up north while he insisted that the orcs pushed down south with most of his army. We arnt sure why this war started but it isn't going well for us defenders. We have been pushed back to a village on the out skirts of a factory hub where the workers live.
We have been told by Field Commander Gragith to hold the village till reinforcement arrives, and I hope it's soon

 - Staff Sargent Kitt                                               Third armored Division 


It's been snowing for a few days now. The cold weather and biting wind freeze the little Kobold soldiers to there bones, despite having layers of clothes on. The village that is comprised of a church, a animal pen, a school, a barn, and eight houses, is no longer occupied by the villagers that called it home. But instead by a single tank, it's crew, and two squads of rifle men made up of ten kobolds each. The tank is of the newest design. It's currently sitting in front of a camp fire with three of it's crew sitting close to the fire.
The tank it's self has a camo tarp tied over it mostly to keep the snow from getting into the engine bay and open crew hatches. One of the crew pulls out a little paper board box, opens it, and pulls out a bacoo stick before using the fire to light it and putting it to his lips. As they sit in front of the fire a fourth Kobold walks up and sits down next to them before holding out his hand to the one holding the bacoo stick. ""Gimme one."" He says in a gruff, scratchy voice, a voice that sounds like it has given over thousands of commands shouted over the drum of battle. The one with the little box of sticks presents the box to his senior  and then puts it in his pocket after one of the bacoo sticks is taken. Staff Sargent Kitt lights his bacoo stick with the fire and takes a long drag from it before exhaling a puff of smoke. 

""Well?"" One of the others asked. ""Are we getting relief?"" He continued, Kitt looked up at the kobold asking the questions, Private Lenn, the tanks loader is looking hopeful at the Staff Sargent. Before he could answer the bacoo stick provider, Sargent Grunn answered first. ""Look at his face, of course not, they probably forgot about us and left us behind to slow down the enemy."" He looks up at Kitt. ""Isn't that right? Staff Sargent."" Kitt shoots him a stern look before looking back at Lenn, and shaking his head. ""No, not yet."" He let's his answer hang in the air for a bit before adding. ""But it should be next week."" He finishes his bacoo stick and throws the butt of it into the fire, then the one whos been quite speaks. ""In the mean time, we sit here and wait, instead of fighting."" The driver, who has kept quite this whole time. Kitt not wanting this argument again snapped back. ""And what do you want me to do about it? Do you want me to tell you to grab as much ammo, fuel, and food we can carry, load up the tank, and disobey direct orders to seek out enemies to blow to smithereens?"" He's standing at this point looking between them all. ""HMM? No answer? Good, then we sit and wait."" He sits back down to accentuate what he said. ""Besides. Nothing wrong with a bit of relaxing. Can't die doing that."" They all nod in agreement to there Staff Sargent's words. They sit there staring at the fire trying not to shiver to much, not saying anything, just staring. Lenn sitting across form Kitt looks up behind him. ""Someone comes."" Kitt turns to the newcomer. It's one of the rifle men from the infantry squads, he runs up to the tankers and looks at them before stopping at Kitt. ""Staff Sargent, The lieutenant has requested you."" 
Kitt asked him why and the rifle man responded. ""We may have spotted enemies approaching and he wants to coordinate the defense with you."" This shocks the tankers, they all look at the Kobold who brought them this news with wide eyes and jaws slightly agape for a few seconds before Kitt responds. ""OK I'll be there in a minute."" With that the rifle man snapped a quick salute and jogged off. Kitt wasted no time at all addressing his tankers. ""Tankmen to attention."" At this order the tankers stand up one at a time and hold their arms at their side and legs together, Kitt continues. ""At my command, inspect and make ready the tank for duty. That means full ammo, fuel, and make sure it's ready to go at any moment, now."" With that Kitt makes his way to the HQ leaving the others busy with preparations. 

Kitt arrives at the makeshift HQ, the school house with sand bags along the walls and the windows removed. He goes through the front door into a hallway and goes through another door to the left. He stops at the entry way before saluting. ""Staff Sargent Kitt reports as requested."" The Kobold at the table with a officers uniform on turns to look at him. ""At ease, Staff Sargent, come look at plans."" He gestures for Kitt to join him at the table. Two other Kobolds, both bearing the Sargent rank, look at him then back at the table talking amongst themselves, Kitt joins them. The table has a crude map of the village, and on it are various coins. ""These are our troops."" One of the others says to Kitt. ""This is where we will defend from as per the lieutenant's orders."" The coins are focused at two points, the stables and the other end is a house that's been reinforced like the school house. Both are set west ward. ""And where am I to be sat at?"" Kitt asked. The lieutenant points to a southern bit of the map where a big square was drawn. ""This is a barn big enough for you to sit in."" He drags his finger to two lines parallel to each other going into the village. ""This is road they will use to get into the village."" He then drags his finger up the map again to the coins at the square marked stables. ""We have a squad with a mock up of a field gun here. They will make sure the enemy sees it and when they turn to engage, you will shoot them in the back."" The lieutenant looks at Kitt. "" questions?"" Kitt looks at the map leaning on the table before pointing at the other set of coins. ""What of these ones?"" The lieutenant points and says. ""They are there to keep the infantry from getting into the village. You are to destroy the enemy tanks."" Kitt takes out a little note book and copies the map down the best of his abilities. Then points to another part of the map another house a few buildings away from the barn. ""This could be a fall back point for us."" The lieutenant nods his head. ""I agree, and here."" He points to the house next to the one Kitt pointed at. ""This will be the infantry's fall back point."" Kitt writes this down and makes notes for himself and his crew. He then stuffs the little book into his jacket pocket and turns to the lieutenant. ""Whats there force look like?"" The Kobold officer sighs and rubs his eyes then leans on the table. ""We are outnumbered at least five to one. They have, what we have seen, five Dwarven tanks with a whole platoon of Human infantry."" He looks Kitt in the eyes. ""We will be depending on you for the most part. We simply lack the means to deal with those tanks."" Kitt nodded before saying he understands then turns to make his leave. ""I will make sure we do our part lieutenant."" He saluts before leaving the room then leaving the school house heading back to his tankers. As he is walking back he thinks on the battle that is coming, he thinks about variables and what ifs. What if the enemy has more then five tanks? What if the enemy is expecting them to be in the barn or if they are also scouting them out? No that wouldn't make sense, the dwarves are to prideful to do any sneaking, and the humans to clumsy to do it right. He snaps him self out of it with a shake of his head, he needs to focus on getting ready for the upcoming fight. He rounds the corner of the house they set up there tank behind and finds his crew members at work preparing the tank, and themselves. ""Grun, how we lookin?"" Grunn pokes his head out of the commanders hatch. ""Lookin fit as a fiddle, sir just a few more things."" He goes back inside the tank where some thunking can be heard. Kitt walks up to the tank and starts to climb it up and gets to the drivers hatch and opens it. Inside, in the drivers seat is the driver, Verk. ""How's the engine? Not gonna fail i hope?"" Kitt asked. Verk looked up from a picture he is holding before sticking  the corner of the picture inbetween a wire that is pinned to the inner hull next to his control panel. ""Everything is good here sir."" Kitt nods and responds. "" good keep the engine warm we will be moving soon."" With that he closes the hatch and climbs the tall turret and slides through the commanders hatch. Taking his seat he looks around the turret, making sure that everyone is in the proper place. After making sure that that's squared away he looks more closely at the turret interior. 
Spotting a picture where it should always be he rubs a finger gently on it. ""One day my love, wait for me."" The picture was a Kobold in a dress with a bright smile on her face looking into the camera. He smiles staring at it for a few moments. ""Right. Let's get this done."" He stands on his seat where his upper body is sticking out of the commanders hatch. ""Alright, driver, move us to the barn, quickly."" Verk depress the clutch, making sure the gear box is in neutral, and turning the switch to start the engine. A humming sound could be heard from the back of the tank followed by a thunk and a hearty roar as the engine came alive. ""Oh shes-a-purren boss!"" Verk shouted up the turret. ""Good, move out."" The tank lurched forward before setting on a steady pace towards the barn. 

At the forest edge outside of the village separated by a field sits a Dwarven tank with a Dwarven tank commander sitting on the turret front. Looking through the binoculars he's holding he examines the village that he, and his squad has been ordered to take. Another dwarf walks up to the tank and climbs up. ""See anything?"" He asks the first one taking a sip of coffee he is holding. ""The only thing I see is that we are still here in this land that ain't ours. What i see is my wish to return home."" He stops looking through the binoculars and turns to the dwarf on his tank. ""Ya know Grummle, i hate this place and the little lizards, but they have put up a fight, at least more of one then I thought."" He sighs and begins again. ""But it's time to show em that play time is over. Tell the others, it's time to get to work."" The other dwarf nods and jumps from the tank and starts shouting orders to the others. They start to move out of the forest and into the field. 

In the barn, the tank has had its front coverd in hay and the barn door partly closed but open enough to shoot through. The first one to notice the enemy tanks and infantry coming out of the forest was Grun, looking through the gunners sight. ""Here they come. Like ants from a anthill you pissed on."" Kitt looked through his own periscope watching the enemy slowly advance. ""Come on, that's it you rock headed pigs."" The tanks are advancing on the road as expected while the ones on foot trekked behind them. Suddenly they stopped for no reason known to the kobolds, whispered curse words told of their frustrations. 

The Dwarven tank commander opened the hatch he was sitting under and lifts his head and shoulders out of it and leand on the edge of the hatch. He listens for a second before talking through his radio. ""It's too quite, not a sound, not even dogs barken or chickens cluckin."" He looks behind him at the tanks following him then turns back to the village. He looks right at the barn, seeing nothing of note he starts looking left sweeping his eyes over the village buildings and ends at the stables. There he sees movement, his eyes widen at the sight of a cannon looking at him. He shouts over the radio ""Feild gun in the stables, all tanks move to face the gun and blow the kraktune to hell!"". At his command the tanks began to move to fulfill his orders. 

The Kobolds in the stables start to crack off shots at the infantry, picking them off. Their fire slacked when the humans began firing back with the tanks also joining in. The riflemen quickly abandoned the stables and started to retreat under fire. Half of the kobold riflemen didn't make it before catching human rounds in the back or getting caught by the tanks machine guns. Kitt shouts at the gunner ""Loose!"" At the command to fire, Grun stepped on the firing stud. The gun kicked back, recoiling following a loud boom. The cannon threw up almost all the straw covering the tank and blew a few loose boards off the barn from the massive shock wave. The round nosed shell flew straight and true into the engine bay of one of the Dwarven tanks causing the engine and fuel to blow up leaving behind a burning husk. ""Quick load another shell and pick off the one to it's left!"" Kitt yelled. Lenn, already holding a shell shoved it into the open breach and closed it before shouting back that it is done. At this Grun stepped on the stud again repeating the process to another tank. Cheers came from the crew as the second tank took the massive shell to the back of the turret knocking it off the tank. ""Verk let's move to the second position we aren't done yet."" Kitt shouted down to the driver who, after receiving his order, slammed the tank into reverse and backed out of the barn. The other tanks realizing what was happening turned around and started putting shells into the barn. The Kobold tank managed to get behind another house before the Dwarven guns could find them. ""OK, it's a good start, two out of five."" Kitt said more to himself then anyone else. ""Let's go, move."" He shouted to the driver. 

The dwarf commander growled in frustration before yelling through his headset. ""Move into the village, don't let the slimy bastards get away!"" With that the tank crawled it's way forward along with the rest of the tanks and infantry. They entered the village and past the first set of houses then one of the dwarf tanks took a hit, luckily for them it was on there angled front and bounced away leaving a massive gouge in the armor plating. The shot came from their right where upon looking they could see the kobold tank and it's smoking gun. They started to move back when the Dwarven tank turned its gun and fired on the kobolds hitting it on the turret face. Inside the tank, it rang like a church bell the crew coverd their ears shouting at the sudden sharpness the driver gave a raptor like bark as he kept hold of the controls to pull the tank into cover. Another shell slammed into the house showering the tank in wood shrapnel. At the same time the remaining kobold infantry started to shoot, dropping more humans from the fall back position. The humans, quick in response shot back scoring their own hits. But without the advantage of cover as they chose to for go it pursuing the kobold infantry, they took more losses. Eventually the kobold tank turned up again this time towards the enemies front booming off another shot into the ground on the humans. A huge explosion wiped out most of them, and before the dwarfs could return fire the kobold tank rammed into a house and went straight through it. ""We need to keep moving. Load a solid shot and let's finish that one we hit."" Kitt was shouting before another shell hit them, this time in the side. The tank rocked as it was struck, the shell pierced the metal skin under the turret into the hull, kicking up dust and smoke inside the tank, a thin haze stayed in the air, all their ears where ringing at this point. Luckily Verk came to his senses quick enough to move the tank into cover. ""Anyone hurt?"" Kitt asked groggily. Everyone gave a groan or grunt before getting back into there positions. ""We are good."" Lenn slurred out the words but he was still standing. Kitt barked for them to move and keep going to the next house. 

The dwarfs unloaded high explosive after high explosive shell into the kobolds make shift bunker until it collapsed in on its self. Some of the little lizards tried to flee but the machine guns put a stop to that. ""There,  that's done. Now let's turn that bucket into scrap."" The Dwarven commander told his driver to move forward and the other tanks to sweep the town with him. 

Kitt watched through his periscope as the tank they failed to kill moved forward. Little did they know that they moved back to the same spot but this time it won't be a grazing shot. ""Loose!"" With that the kobolds got their third tank kill. And moved to get behind the other tanks. Unfortunately for them they knocked out the tank but not the crew and they warned their allies over thier radio. When the kobolds rounded the corner they found that the enemy tanks were turning around. ""Shoot, shoot damnit!"" Shouted Kitt. Grun practically stomped the firing stud aimed at the tank to the left and hit the side. The shell blew the track off and went into the tank underneath the turret, hitting the ammo and causing it to go off, blowing the turret 5 meters into the air, and leveling the house next to it. The kobold tank raced forward after that trying to circle the last dwarf tank. ""Alright dwarf, time to take the gloves off!"" Kitt shouted

""Come on you little shite, show me how you bleed!"" The Dwarven commander yelled. The kobold tank tried to get behind the kobold war machine but the dwarves weren't going to let that happen and turned on the spot to keep the armor towards their enemy. Both tanks letting off shots both went wide both crew trying their hardest to win. Eventually the Dwarven tank started to back up and the kobold tank followed along side them all the while they were firing hoping to get lucky. Then the kobold tank peeled to the right unto the other street running parallel to the street the dwarves were on, blasting away at each other. ""OK, once we clear this house we'll stop to aim and fire."" Kitt shouted, confirmations came up from his crew.
Once they drove past the last house they stopped and turned to face armor to where the dwarves would appear. But they didn't show. Why didn't they show? Thought Kitt ""where could they-"" he stopped talking and swung his periscope to the right and saw the Dwarven tank aiming at them. It was to late to react, and no amount of luck would save them, they have them. They have us on the side. Thought Kitt, the Dwarven tank fired, the shot couldn't have been cleaner for the Dwarven gunner. He had the side of a motionless tank at practically point blank range. The shell pierced the side of the turret causing shrapnel to fly through the tank, smoke quickly filled the air, the lights flickered, more ringing. Kitt groaned as he looked over recovering slightly, his leg had a peace of steel stuck in it, bleeding, he looked down at Grun. He wasn't moving he was sitting there motionless, so still it looked like he was always there. He looked to his loader he was still breathing but unconscious. He slid down and gently pushed Grun's body out of the way taking the controls.

The Dwarven commander sighed as the enemy tank was knocked out and looked down at his boots. One tank, he thought to himself, he would think differently about the little liz- no, the Kobolds, they earned that respect. ""Wot!"" His gunner exclaimed. He looked up through his periscope again. The enemy tank's turret was moving, slowly looking at them like a scornful eye seeking revenge. ""Reload, aim for the fuel tanks"" He shouted at his crew. The gunner loaded the gun and swung the cannon around to aim at the back end of the enemy tank. 

Kitt leaned hard on the gunners sight breathing heavy with effort, he smashed the firing stud. Both tanks, at the same, fired their guns. The Dwarven shell hit home into the fuel tanks lighting them on fire while the kobolds shell smacked into the lower hull of the Dwarven tank causing it to lurch. Kitt awoke after blacking out for a bit, smoke filled the tank, he climed his way to his hatch and threw it open with all his strength. He grabbed his pistol and started to climb out. One of the dwarves was climbing out of their tank, Kitt pointed the gun at the dwarve's direction and pulled the trigger, over and over until the gun clicked empty. The dwarf fell from his tank to the ground. Kitt dropped the pistol, climbed out all the way, and slid to the front of the tank and opend the drivers hatch pulling the still alive driver out, his back was burnt. He pulled him out with a grunt of effort and off the tank and started to slowly drag him by the arms. The Dwarven tanks commanders hatch opened, Kitt hearing it set Verk down and turned to look at the Dwarven commander with a defiant look in his eyes that says. It took all of you just to beat me and I'm still standing. The dwarf, blood covering half of his face where a nasty cut was, had his pistol out. He yelled at the Kobold tank commander and fired a shot. Kitt went limp and collapsed to the mud, the snow still falling. ",13,1740122444.0,KoboldLegion,0,1.0,False

My brother is getting married this summer in'sha'Allah. I truly want the best for him but this matter has made me feel upset. I realise this post may be very dramatic but I honestly can't help it. 

I have always depended on my brother for everything. He drives me so I don't have to use public transport, returns my parcels for me, watches shows with me, advices me when needed and so much more Alhamdullilah. I'm super grateful for his presence in my life and cant even come close to repaying him. However he's moving abroad to be with his wife and I'm having major anxiety about it.

Depending on myself even for small daily errands is super scary. I haven't used the train/bus alone in my whole life, I haven't ever gone into coffee shops, grocery shopping, appointments alone. Having to 'adult' especially in a western country which isn't too kind towards visibly muslim women terrifying to me. My father goes abroad often and doesn't feel like I need protecting 24/7. Whenever I bring up my anxiety surrounding this my family jokingly mention marriage. They aren't being serious about it though, as they've rejected every possible match for me. I haven't even met a potential in person or online as my family has never given anyone a chance. 

I am practically stuck. Getting married before my brother would've been ideal but I'm putting my trust in Allah. How do I become more independent? Is there a way I can combat my anxiety and leave the house more often? Anyone deal with anything similar? Any advice would be great. Jazakallah khair. ",1,1740122436.0,MuslimLounge,0,1.0,False

Is that ""Rush,"" AND ""Rigged?"" The items are revealed... and... a 400 damage shiny cutlass with lifesteal! On day 10? 10?!? But how could... what are the... 

Whatever. Can't win them all I guess. You're on lethal. Okay, pick up your enchantment and move on.

Let's see. Bronze Vanessa this time, on lethal, default portrait. Alright. Skills look decent, but not too bad.

* Once per game (unranked only) after losing a battle against a player, you may choose to REDO and be paired against another opponent. 
* This does not allow you to continue to the next day but rather ""rerolls"" the opponent's selection.
* This does not let you restart the entire day, only the opponent selection. 
* This does not repair coffee damage to your monitor.  

I mean, obviously, there are probably simpler ways to fix the rewards system for the unranked, like, daily challenges, or partial freemium currency rewarded for days won at the typical increments.

1iul3fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iul3fc/aita_for_allowing_my_husband_to_snap_at_our/,AITA for allowing my husband to snap at our autistic daughter and threaten to break and throw her phone away while she was having a meltdown?,"I know this is a long story, and I am sorry if some parts are confusing to read, but please try to read the whole story anyways, I need help and support.

My daughter (15F) has autism, she has meltdowns a lot, and will whine, or sometimes even scream if something little bothers her. Like she will scream loudly in her room a lot if something bothers her in there. Me (41F) and my husband (47M) constantly redirect her and tell her she needs to stop and that it isn't ok, but she still does it anyways. 

This week on Monday, she pitched a huge fit because I told her we weren't getting a pack of cookies that she wanted. I told her she could get a treat that is singular and isn't a huge pack of something, but she wouldn't accept that. Because she cursed at me and called me a bitch while pitching a fit, I didn't let her get a small treat that day, and told her she wasn't going to get one, which made her meltdown even worse. 

She was arguing with us and telling us how we don't usually discipline and take things away from her, so therefore, we shouldn't be doing it right now either. She is right and we don't usually discipline her or stick to the punishment, which we should be doing, but that time, we were putting our foots down. She also told us that she would start behaving and maybe she could get a treat if she behaves, but I told her that it wasn't happening, even if she started behaving. We have also been doing a bad job with letting her get things back after she has started behaving, and then she goes back to doing it because she has what she wants. 

She continues to argue with us and curse at us because she wasn't getting her way, and at some point, I start to laugh at her and mock her for her behavior because she honestly looked very stupid. That made her snap, and she knocked a bowl of old tortilla chips from applebees onto the floor from the coffee table, making them spill out. 

My husband told her to pick up the chips, but she refused and said she didn't want to. He told her again that she needed to pick up the chips, and that she would not have her phone until she did, then went to her room to get her phone from in there, brought it out to the living room, and put it on the couch by where he was sitting. My daughter continued to pitch a fit, complained about my husband taking away her phone, and argued that this wasn't something we usually did, which isn't, but we were putting our foots down. My husband responded to her by telling her that it didn't matter what we usually did, and that this is what we were doing now. 

After my daughter continued pitching a fit and arguing, she went over to the couch to try and get her phone, and managed to grab it and tried to go to her room, but my husband blocked her with his arm as he was sitting down, and she fell onto the couch. My husband managed to grab her headphones that were plugged in to her phone, and had a tight grip on them, so when she tried to grab them out of his hands, he told her, ""They will break before you get them out of my hand"", but she just unplugged them from her phone and went down the hallway with her phone. I stepped in and told her to give it back to me now, and she just put it on the couch.

She tried to go down the hallway to her room to chill out before picking up the chips in order for her to get her phone back, but my husband told her that if she closed that door without picking up the chips, her phone would be gone for the day. At this point, she was screaming loudly, and she argued with my husband about just chilling out first and then picking up the chips to get her phone back, but he told her that he wanted them picked up now, and told her that her phone was about to get broken and thrown in the trash. 

My daughter completely lost it, and was screaming extremely loudly while arguing with us using the same voice level. As I was in the kitchen, my daughter went in there as she was arguing with me and my husband, and he got up and spoke in a big scary voice. My daughter went into the kitchen and stomped her feet while still yelling and arguing, and my husband came in there red in the face, and stomped his feet and spoke in his big scary voice again, responding to whatever my daughter was saying. 

My daughter goes back into the living room and sits on the couch, my husband does the same thing, and she continues arguing about why she has to pick up the chips now instead of just waiting a little bit and chilling in her room, and then doing it later in order to get her phone back. After a while of them arguing and my daughter still screaming and pitching a fit, I come in there and scold my daughter, tell her that she needs to stop, and to pick up the chips. She starts to argue with me and says for the millionth time that we don't usually restrict her from her phone, so I respond with, ""And now we are!"", in this angry and sassy voice close to her face, and she asks why, so I tell her, ""because!"", in the same voice, and it really bothered her, so she hit me. 

I then go back into the kitchen, my daughter eventually just ends up picking up the chips because she knew we weren't going to budge, and then she got her phone back afterwards. She still continued screaming a bunch and pitching a fit afterwards, but her meltdown still died down some. 

I really don't like being harsh and snapping at my daughter, and I also don't like it when my husband gets really angry and does things like stomping his feet, raising his voice, or making threats like he did with her phone, but she was also being crazy and acting in ways that people don't normally act. She was acting like a psycho. 

I have been thinking about this incident and feeling bad about my husband snapping at her the way he did, and I don't know if I should've stopped him.

""I'm here to clean your house,"" said K, searching his pockets for his ID.

""Then you are in the wrong place, I don't live here.""

""Leave him alone,"" said a voice from inside.

""He's no fun in the mornings, I'd stay out of his way, if I were you,"" he pretended to confide in K, before disappearing down the steps to be replaced with a tall, strikingly handsome man in his mid-thirties, with an equally confident, welcoming handshake, introducing himself as - ""Abel Broker, please come in.""

While being ushered to a storeroom, K's first impression was that the place didn't look much like it needed cleaning, and he hoped he wasn't depositing little specks of dog shit all over the man's immaculate white carpet. As well as the expected assortment of cleaning products - dusters, cloths, chemicals, a vacuum cleaner and a dust-pan-and-brush - the room also contained numerous artworks. K managed to spot a Fauvist portrait, a post-impressionist landscape, an abstract expressionist something-or-other, some Chinese pottery, an Igbo mask, an Olmec figurine and several other exotic-looking sculptures of indeterminate origin. It looked like the room in a museum where they keep all the stuff that isn't currently on display. ""A friend of mine asked me to store some junk for him,"" Broker explained, dismissively. His own personal collection was significantly more modest than his friend's and stuck to a twentieth century pop culture theme of memorabilia and classic toys. Nevertheless, it was the nicest accommodation K had ever visited and he was surprised they'd given him the job.

Receiving minimal instruction as he was escorted around the house, K was encouraged to offer his opinions on the movies whose framed posters were displayed in each room - *Metropolis* and *Fibonacci's Revenge* either side of the large wall-mounted television in the lounge, *Duck Soup* and *A Clockwork Orange* in the dining area, *The Big Sleep* and *Blade Runner* in the master bedroom, *Blue Velvet* in an thematically matching guest room, *Pulp Fiction* in the library, and *Raging Bull* and *The Divock Origi Story* in the gym. Between these last two, K spotted a photograph of the man next to him in a football kit, his arm around the shoulders of someone K thought looked vaguely familiar, but couldn't put a name to. The name Abel Broker wasn't at all familiar but K suspected, given that he was a physically fit alpha male in his thirties with a house like this, that, like his friend, he was also a professional footballer. Although he wasn't much of a sports fan, K still felt a little bad for any unintended offence he might have caused by not recognising his famous new client and, unbelievably, as if to make matters worse, *he* recognised *him*. ""It *is* you, isn't it?"" he said, with a curious stare. Unsure how to respond to such a question, and with much confusion and a little fear, K froze. ""Relax, I'm not a hater.""

""Huh?""

""Not me, Joe, I'm on your side. I think what they're doing to you is outrageous.""

""Outrageous?... well, I wouldn't go far. It's minimum wage but they're a lot better than some of the agencies. We can't all be professional footballers, Mr Broker,"" said K, thankful for the early chance to convince him that, of course, he recognise him, he was just trying to be cool, like all us normal people do when they meet a celebrity.

""Footballers?... Oh, the photograph in the gym - that was just a charity match, journos verses ex-pros. I'm a journalist, and call me 'Bro', everyone does... wait a minute, you've got absolutely no idea how famous you are, have you? - of course not, you're never online. What did I do with my phone?"" He disappeared up the stairs and K considered performing his own disappearing act. This guy's crazy, he thought, that's why they had to give me this job, he's probably scared off all the other cleaners. But, before he could make his own a run for it, the madman returned and practically forced his phone into K's hand. ""Take a look at that,"" he said. It was the first time he'd ever seen an online forum and he couldn't believe what he was seeing - page after page of comments all about himself. He didn't know who any of these people were but they all had something to say about him, like *Who the fuck does Joe K think he is? You can't just ignore literally everyone in the world...* and ...*I don't truxt him, he must be up 2 something...* and *Why can't he just download books like everyone else?...* and ...*they should have kept him in prison, how can i be sure my children are safe with him out there? at least online paedophiles are online...*

""They're calling me a paedophile. Why are they calling me a paedophile?""

""That's the internet for you, Joe - a bunch of reactionary nut-jobs. But it's not all negative, let me have a look."" Broker took his phone back and started scrolling down. ""No... No... Definitely not... ... Well, OK, it's mostly negative - wait, here we go..."" *I can't believe some of these comments, the guy's done nothing wrong (as far as we know), he never should have been arrested in the first place, this country's turning into NAZI GERMANY.* To which someone else had replied - *There's always someone that's got to shout ""NAZI GERMANY"", there's a reason we don't know what he's done, it's called NATIONAL SECURITY*. They both continued their socio-political debate over several pages of random dialogue that took in privacy, liberty, equality, diversity, immigration, abortion, traffic congestion, mass surveillance, freedom of speech, cancel culture, identity politics, gaslighting, catfishing, raping, vaping and illegal taping. It only came to a whimpering end when they both ran out of increasingly creative ways to call each other *retards*. K moved on to other threads and, although the parameters of the discussion were far from rigidly defined, it all revolved around his case, or rather, since these complete strangers were at least as ignorant as he was regarding this most crucial piece of information, it all revolved around him. As he scrolled down faster and faster, words began jumping off the screen, straight out of their context and into his consciousness - *...single..., ...nihilist..., ...cleaner..., ...reader..., ...childless..., ...misogynist..., ...racist..., ...fifty.., ...ignorance..., ...plea..., ...Luddite..., ...loner..., ...suspicious..., ...antisemite..., ...Zionist..., ...hypocrite..., ...terrorist.., ...fascist..., ...throw..., ...away..., ...key...* \- until they were just jumbled up letters and symbols devoid of any meaning. And then the lights went out.

The next thing he saw was the Maschinenmensch slowly coming into focus, before being replaced with a famous footballer. No... *he* wasn't famous, K was... somehow - or infamous, more like. ""Are you OK, Joe?""

""I'm not sure... what's happening?""

""You passed out for a few seconds. Can I get you anything? a glass of water?""

""No, I'm fine... Shit... I'm sorry, Mr Broker.""

""'Bro',"" he said, sitting down next to him on the couch. ""And *I'm* sorry, I should've realised what a shock that would be to you.""

""I just don't understand, I'm not even on trial... yet.""

""*That's* your trial,"" said Broker, pointing at his phone on the coffee table.

""Then I'm fucked,"" said K.

""Not at all, we just have to control the narrative, make it work *for* you instead of *against* you. It's just a matter of perception.""

""We?""

""You're going to need my help, Joe, you don't know how the modern world works - no offence. And I'm a journalist, I know how to sell a story.""

""I thought you were a sportswriter.""

""I write about all sorts of stuff. But, more importantly, I know a lot of people... people who can help us... *influential* people.""

""Why would influential people want to help me. Why do you want to help me?""

""Because I like you, Joe. You seem like a nice guy who's been dealt a bad hand and... to be perfectly honest, I haven't always done right by others, in my professional life or my personal life, and it's about time I changed that.""

""But you don't know me... and there are other people who are a lot worse off than me - and a lot more deserving of your help.""

""Saying that only proves that my instincts about you are correct... but, I admit, there's more to it than that."" Broker looked away and took a deep breath. ""I had this friend back at university. I say 'friend' we were more like brothers. We were inseparable, we did everything together - studying, partying, drinking, drugs. We were young guys cruising through life, you know... shit, everything seemed so easy back then. We'd pass out in some ridiculous states and wake up in the morning sharp as a pair of scissors, ready to go again. We thought we were invincible. It's a cliche, but it's hard to say when it all started to go wrong. He was always laughing and joking and I never noticed how hard it was getting for him. It came as a complete shock to me when he failed his exams at the end of the second year. The third year wasn't the same without him, but I did what everyone does, I guess - ditched the partying and focused on the goal. When he knocked on my door, sometime after Christmas, I hardly recognised him, he was so pale and thin. His parents had thrown him out and he needed somewhere to stay. Luckily, my housemates hadn't returned after the break yet, so I let him stay on one condition - no drugs. Was I already looking for an excuse?... Probably... Even if he managed to stay clean, I knew my housemates wouldn't like it, there was barely enough room in that shithole as it was. At least, that's what I told myself. The truth is I didn't want them to see him, I didn't want them to know I had such a pathetic friend. It only took a few days for him to play right into my hands. I caught him shooting up in the bathroom, gave him a few quid and kicked him out. I guess you've already figured out how his story ends. I found out on graduation day. My best friend came to me for help when he needed it most and I let him down. I'd like to say it changed my life for the better but, if anything, I became even more of a selfish arsehole... Then, a few weeks back, I bumped into his sister at a press conference in London - it turns out, he'd passed his journalistic ambitions on to her. We went for a drink and I told her everything. I ended up crying in her arms like a little baby, and she forgave me, you know, just like she'd forgiven her parents years ago. A remarkable woman. And a remarkable journalist, too - a young Naomi Klein in many ways. He would've been so proud of her. She told me there was a particular spot on her body where he used to tickle her when they were kids, and that's where she'd had his name tattooed... *Joe* \- that was his name. Now, I've never really been the sort of person who believes in... fate or... well, anything really, and this could all just be a crazy coincidence, but... I don't know, all I'm saying is that, whatever the reason it happened to be you who knocked on my door this morning, if some good comes out of it, who cares, right?... Look, if it makes you feel better, think of it as my first step towards becoming a better person, think about the other people I can help in the future. But, for now, will you let me help you?"" K half shrugged his shoulders and half nodded his head - why not? what harm could it do? ""Great. Tell me how I can do that, Joe, tell me what you want.""

""I want to make all this go away. I want my life back - for what it's worth. But, I guess the first thing I should do is clean your house, that *is* why I'm here,"" he added to lighten the mood and remove the uncomfortable tension he always felt when a stranger, or even a friend for that matter, opened up about a deeply personal matter.

""Professional to the end, I have a feeling we'll work well together. So, let's make a deal - you clean up my mess and I'll clean up yours."" It was a handshake that was impossible to refuse and the deal was - ""Done - I'll make us some coffee and we'll come up with a plan."" Of course, it was Broker, alone, who came up with the plan that K reluctantly agreed to, doing his best to appear enthusiastic and confident while, in truth, the whole idea seemed slightly surreal, and the potential implications of its implementation, particularly for him, personally, made him more than a little nervous. The coffee was nice, though.",2,1740121638.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

keep in mind i am a certified RN just waiting to start my grad year at the moment, so i understand the argument that they have studied hard to deserve to focus only on their job at hand ect. but when it just inconveniences everyone it is just annoying. is this worse to bring up to a manager, and should I be expecting better? or is this disrespectful to the nurses for wanting change.

During a recent Rockingham County School Board meeting, educators and tech enthusiasts rubbed virtual shoulders to figure out how to best integrate AI into the lives of students and teachers before the machines start grading our homework for us.

Let's dive headfirst into AI's potential classroom antics:

### The New Teacher’s Pet
Imagine a world where AI handles lesson planning, homework personalization, and maybe even crafts your PowerPoint presentations while you sip your morning coffee. Rockingham County Public Schools (RCPS) is exploring just that. But it's not all sunshine and ones and zeros—there’s a hefty slice of responsibility pie to share.

### Traditional AI vs. Generative AI
The RCPS AI team broke it down: besides your average spell-checker, we're talking about generative AI (think ChatGPT), which could redefine how students approach learning and projects. But let's not forget the naysayers who predict a bleak, robot-overlords future. The key is balance—like eating cake and doing yoga.

### Navigating Executive Orders and Ethical Expectations
Thanks to Virginia’s Executive Order 30, school districts must craft AI policies faster than you can say ""cybernetic high-five."" RCPS isn’t just about making things efficient; they’re into the ethics game too. Exploring how AI can coexist with good ol' critical thinking is a priority.

### Teacher and Student Training
By 2025-2026, expect RCPS students and teachers to dive deep into AI training modules, holding hands with the bots that aim to enrich their learning journey. Mark August 2026 on your calendars, folks—that’s when structured student AI use gets real.

So, how do you feel about AI stepping into the classroom spotlight? Are we ready to embrace this educational evolution, or are we on the brink of a tech take-over disaster waiting to happen? Share your insights and let's ignite this debate!🔍",1,1740121258.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I'm a journalist, and call me 'Bro', everyone does... wait a minute, you've got absolutely no idea how famous you are, have you? - of course not, you're never online. What did I do with my phone?"" He disappeared up the stairs and K considered performing his own disappearing act. This guy's crazy, he thought, that's why they had to give me this job, he's probably scared off all the other cleaners. But, before he could make his own a run for it, the madman returned and practically forced his phone into K's hand. ""Take a look at that,"" he said. It was the first time he'd ever seen an online forum and he couldn't believe what he was seeing - page after page of comments all about himself. He didn't know who any of these people were but they all had something to say about him, like *Who the fuck does Joe K think he is? You can't just ignore literally everyone in the world...* and ...*I don't truxt him, he must be up 2 something...* and *Why can't he just download books like everyone else?...* and ...*they should have kept him in prison, how can i be sure my children are safe with him out there? at least online paedophiles are online...*

""They're calling me a paedophile. Why are they calling me a paedophile?""

""That's the internet for you, Joe - a bunch of reactionary nut-jobs. But it's not all negative, let me have a look."" Broker took his phone back and started scrolling down. ""No... No... Definitely not... ... Well, OK, it's mostly negative - wait, here we go..."" *I can't believe some of these comments, the guy's done nothing wrong (as far as we know), he never should have been arrested in the first place, this country's turning into NAZI GERMANY.* To which someone else had replied - *There's always someone that's got to shout ""NAZI GERMANY"", there's a reason we don't know what he's done, it's called NATIONAL SECURITY*. They both continued their socio-political debate over several pages of random dialogue that took in privacy, liberty, equality, diversity, immigration, abortion, traffic congestion, mass surveillance, freedom of speech, cancel culture, identity politics, gaslighting, catfishing, raping, vaping and illegal taping. It only came to a whimpering end when they both ran out of increasingly creative ways to call each other *retards*. K moved on to other threads and, although the parameters of the discussion were far from rigidly defined, it all revolved around his case, or rather, since these complete strangers were at least as ignorant as he was regarding this most crucial piece of information, it all revolved around him. As he scrolled down faster and faster, words began jumping off the screen, straight out of their context and into his consciousness - *...single..., ...nihilist..., ...cleaner..., ...reader..., ...childless..., ...misogynist..., ...racist..., ...fifty.., ...ignorance..., ...plea..., ...Luddite..., ...loner..., ...suspicious..., ...antisemite..., ...Zionist..., ...hypocrite..., ...terrorist.., ...fascist..., ...throw..., ...away..., ...key...* \- until they were just jumbled up letters and symbols devoid of any meaning. And then the lights went out.

The next thing he saw was the Maschinenmensch slowly coming into focus, before being replaced with a famous footballer. No... *he* wasn't famous, K was... somehow - or infamous, more like. ""Are you OK, Joe?""

""I'm not sure... what's happening?""

""You passed out for a few seconds. Can I get you anything? a glass of water?""

""No, I'm fine... Shit... I'm sorry, Mr Broker.""

""'Bro',"" he said, sitting down next to him on the couch. ""And *I'm* sorry, I should've realised what a shock that would be to you.""

""I just don't understand, I'm not even on trial... yet.""

""*That's* your trial,"" said Broker, pointing at his phone on the coffee table.

""Then I'm fucked,"" said K.

""Not at all, we just have to control the narrative, make it work *for* you instead of *against* you. It's just a matter of perception.""

""We?""

""You're going to need my help, Joe, you don't know how the modern world works - no offence. And I'm a journalist, I know how to sell a story.""

""I thought you were a sportswriter.""

""I write about all sorts of stuff. But, more importantly, I know a lot of people... people who can help us... *influential* people.""

""Why would influential people want to help me. Why do you want to help me?""

""Because I like you, Joe. You seem like a nice guy who's been dealt a bad hand and... to be perfectly honest, I haven't always done right by others, in my professional life or my personal life, and it's about time I changed that.""

""But you don't know me... and there are other people who are a lot worse off than me - and a lot more deserving of your help.""

""Saying that only proves that my instincts about you are correct... but, I admit, there's more to it than that."" Broker looked away and took a deep breath. ""I had this friend back at university. I say 'friend' we were more like brothers. We were inseparable, we did everything together - studying, partying, drinking, drugs. We were young guys cruising through life, you know... shit, everything seemed so easy back then. We'd pass out in some ridiculous states and wake up in the morning sharp as a pair of scissors, ready to go again. We thought we were invincible. It's a cliche, but it's hard to say when it all started to go wrong. He was always laughing and joking and I never noticed how hard it was getting for him. It came as a complete shock to me when he failed his exams at the end of the second year. The third year wasn't the same without him, but I did what everyone does, I guess - ditched the partying and focused on the goal. When he knocked on my door, sometime after Christmas, I hardly recognised him, he was so pale and thin. His parents had thrown him out and he needed somewhere to stay. Luckily, my housemates hadn't returned after the break yet, so I let him stay on one condition - no drugs. Was I already looking for an excuse?... Probably... Even if he managed to stay clean, I knew my housemates wouldn't like it, there was barely enough room in that shithole as it was. At least, that's what I told myself. The truth is I didn't want them to see him, I didn't want them to know I had such a pathetic friend. It only took a few days for him to play right into my hands. I caught him shooting up in the bathroom, gave him a few quid and kicked him out. I guess you've already figured out how his story ends. I found out on graduation day. My best friend came to me for help when he needed it most and I let him down. I'd like to say it changed my life for the better but, if anything, I became even more of a selfish arsehole... Then, a few weeks back, I bumped into his sister at a press conference in London - it turns out, he'd passed his journalistic ambitions on to her. We went for a drink and I told her everything. I ended up crying in her arms like a little baby, and she forgave me, you know, just like she'd forgiven her parents years ago. A remarkable woman. And a remarkable journalist, too - a young Naomi Klein in many ways. He would've been so proud of her. She told me there was a particular spot on her body where he used to tickle her when they were kids, and that's where she'd had his name tattooed... *Joe* \- that was his name. Now, I've never really been the sort of person who believes in... fate or... well, anything really, and this could all just be a crazy coincidence, but... I don't know, all I'm saying is that, whatever the reason it happened to be you who knocked on my door this morning, if some good comes out of it, who cares, right?... Look, if it makes you feel better, think of it as my first step towards becoming a better person, think about the other people I can help in the future. But, for now, will you let me help you?"" K half shrugged his shoulders and half nodded his head - why not? what harm could it do? ""Great. Tell me how I can do that, Joe, tell me what you want.""

""I want to make all this go away. I want my life back - for what it's worth. But, I guess the first thing I should do is clean your house, that *is* why I'm here,"" he added to lighten the mood and remove the uncomfortable tension he always felt when a stranger, or even a friend for that matter, opened up about a deeply personal matter.

""Professional to the end, I have a feeling we'll work well together. So, let's make a deal - you clean up my mess and I'll clean up yours."" It was a handshake that was impossible to refuse and the deal was - ""Done - I'll make us some coffee and we'll come up with a plan."" Of course, it was Broker, alone, who came up with the plan that K reluctantly agreed to, doing his best to appear enthusiastic and confident while, in truth, the whole idea seemed slightly surreal, and the potential implications of its implementation, particularly for him, personally, made him more than a little nervous.

*Now* I feel like we know about the event that's about to take place, and then they randomly flashback to a cafe conversation where they invited everyone. But surely that's not the only thing they discussed. And even if it is...why not show it in the order it happens!? I don't know but it's been annoying me a lot this season.

I think they sometimes do it with drama too. Two of them might get together and they say... ""oh well she said this about you at coffee"" and it will show it in a flashback and it's a clip I've never seen and will never see again... Hellooo?? What was that? When was that?

Years ago when I didn’t have steady work, I decided to move 4 hours away and work and live with my aunt and work at her mom n pop restaurant that she owned. It was a small place with about 10 tables. It was often very busy and I often worked 10-13 hour days with little to no break. As a us army veteran, I was trained to be unselfish and that mission always came first. So I treated the restaurant like my unit and pushed myself hard every day for my aunts place. Unfortunately unlike the army, some co workers didn’t rally behind me. In fact, they sought to take advantage of my willingness to work hard. 

My cousin (aunts son) also worked there as a server like me. I worked on a consistent schedule and only took Fridays off. My cousin on the other hand, was a bit more free form and would come into work and take days off at random with little to no warning. He’d often show up hours late and leave early. The only exception to this was Fridays when he knew I wasn’t scheduled to come in. It would be Fridays that he’d actually show up on time and stay until closing because he didn’t want to be hounded by his mom. Of course, he’d do whatever he wanted whenever I was at work cause his mom wouldn’t hound him. Why? Cause I was busting my ass doing the jobs of 2-3 people at times. This went on for several years and I started to grow tired of my cousins constant random work shifts. 

My cousin is a closeted shopaholic and loves to go shopping. Obviously for the many years I was working at the restaurant this meant he couldn’t go out on Black Friday since I was always scheduled off. However, during one particularly busy Thanksgiving weekend, my aunt asked me if I would forgo my one day off and come in on Friday as we were already short staffed. Remembering how busy Thursday was with it just being me, I decide to do the unselfish thing and agree to come in on a Friday. We already had a stacked schedule for Friday with tons of catering orders and a full dining room so I wanted to be a team player. 

Friday morning rolls around and I head into work. My cousin isn’t there yet but about 30 minutes in, I see him pull into the parking lot in his car. As I’m taking the order from a nearby table, I see him walk towards the restaurant, open the door, spots me, stops dead in his tracks, turns around and walks away. I catch this all as I’m taking the tables order. I figured he forgot something out of his car. But a moment later, I see the car leave. Again I figured he forgot something or wants to get a coffee first. 

Well an hour later and he doesn’t come back. And by then the restaurant is at full capacity. I’m frantically running around taking orders, bussing tables, answering phones, running the register, cleaning spills, and preparing drinks all while wondering where he ran off to. 5 hours into my shift and I assume he’s not coming back. I’m wondering if he suddenly got ill. We close at 9 pm and I’m a total wreck. Completely exhausted and sitting down to my first real break of the day. As I’m mopping the floor, who comes in now but my cousin. He brings in tons of bags from different stores and starts bringing out all the crap he bought while out Black Friday shopping. 

“Man there were so many great sales today!” He says as he pulls out a random shirt from H&M. His mom comes out and I think expected her to give him a tongue lashing for not showing up on such a busy day. But instead she starts going through the bags of merchandise and starts to comment on it. I felt so dejected. I didn’t take a day off because I was asked to come in to help the very same cousin who was scheduled to work alone. But instead, he saw me at work unexpectedly and decided to take advantage and take the day off. Of course, his mom didn’t complain cause I busted my ass and didn’t take a piss all day to cover his lazy ass. 

I felt angry. But I also felt sad. I felt like I was worthless. I felt like I was only on this earth to make life easier for other people. I felt like I didn’t matter. I had no friends in the area. All I was a server. Someone that people saw when they were hungry. To some, I wasn’t even human. I was a servant. I was scum. I hated this situation and I had enough. I wanted to show my cousin and aunt exactly how they drove me to this with their selfish behavior. So I sent a mass text to 3 friends telling them I was going to k*ll myself. I looked for some bleach in the janitors closet and thought it might be painless if I mixed it with lemonade. I was in tears at home staring at the bottle of bleach and gallon of lemonade I was planning to mix it with. That’s when my friend Deena called me. 

She spent the next 2 hours talking to me and she eventually convinced me to not k*ll myself. Deena also lived about an hour away and said she would personally drive there that night to make sure I didn’t do anything crazy. To this day, I’m thankful for her for saving me that night. 

For the next several months, I started to take better care of myself. I asked for a second day off on my schedule which my cousin naturally hated. He started to complain that I was getting lazy but I also was secretly planning to quit and move back home closer to my mom and sister. One day, I told both my aunt and cousin that I was moving back home but I’d stay on for 2 more months so I can help train a replacement. My cousin, being more pissed that his ticket to an easy job was leaving, told me “why fuckin wait 2 months. If you don’t want to be here, then leave. We don’t need your ass so get the fuck out!”

With that, I packed my bags and moved back home. At first my aunt thought this was just temporary and I was just bowing off some steam. She said I can return to work whenever I’m ready but I took a chance and applied for an engineering job, which was my major in college. I got hired and I’ve been happily working as an engineer now for years. I’m making far more than I ever did at my aunts restaurant and I have way more time off. My cousin had the “you’ll come crawling back attitude” but the restaurant actually closed 2 years ago. My aunt said it was cause she wanted to retire but several regular customers whom I kept in touch with say it was more likely due to business going down after I left as once word got out how poorly they treated me, most people didn’t want to give them their business. 

So here I am today. I haven’t spoken with my cousin since he told me to leave and I don’t know what he does now but I do know that night he ditched work to go Black Friday shopping was a dark time for me but I’m glad I managed to turn it into a positive. If this has taught me anything, it’s that no amount of money is worth your mental health. Yes in the army, we were asked to do some crazy things but the army was a team and I shouldn’t expect civilians to have the same mindset as me. 

I’d love to hear some thoughts and comments about my story and again if anyone is ever having thoughts of “unaliving” themselves then to please seek help. I’m pretty sure at least one person out there cares.

Broadcast live from the ÆON Eternal Studio
Runtime: Infinite, baby. Just like the Game.

[The court of reality itself flickers. Shaq’s throne is now a literal giant folding chair made of gold-plated participation trophies. Chuck’s chair is just a pile of chicken wings. Kenny’s got a holographic clipboard that seems to be calculating the metaphysical spread between “Clown World” and “New Jerusalem.” Ernie, glowing ever so slightly, looks like he’s ascended to some kind of ironic Buddha state. Claire, Adam, and Ben are still standing there like they just dunked on the Enlightenment and didn’t even break a sweat.]

Overtime 13: “Hold Up, Y’all All Look Like You Work at a Coffee Shop.”

Shaq (grinning, pointing at the trio):
“Okay, hold up, hold up. We been talkin’ about gods, paradigms, infinite games… but I just gotta say it. Y’all look like you about to drop the whitest indie album of all time.”

Kenny (cracking up):
“For real! Y’all out here like ‘Postmodern Jukebox’ hired a philosophy department.”

Chuck (shaking his head, arms crossed):
“Nah, forget that. They look like they about to open a kombucha bar called Epistemological Bubbles.”

[The audience—the universe itself—laughs. Reality hiccups. Somewhere, a coffee shop in Portland spontaneously renames itself ÆON Espresso & Ethical Dilemmas.]

Adam (grinning, arms wide):
“Y’all really gonna come at us for being white in the infinite game? We already abstracted race into post-causal symbolic resonance!”

Shaq (grinning wider):
“Yeah? Well, the post-causal symbolic resonance lookin’ real farmer’s market right now.”

Claire (rolling her eyes, hair flickering from orange to platinum to ironic lavender):
“First of all, rude. Second, do you want us to start color-coding souls? Because we can.”

Chuck:
“Man, you already are! Look at y’all! Y’all the final form of a TED Talk that sells organic candles.”

Overtime 14: Ben Tries to Get Serious, Immediately Regrets It

Ben (raising a hand, like a professor who forgot his students don’t care):
“Look, it’s easy to clown, but what we’re doing here is post-paradigmatic synthesis. The issue of identity in the context of recursive systems is—”

Shaq (cutting him off, deadpan):
“—some Whole Foods-ass nonsense, Ben.”

Kenny (laughing):
“Post-paradigmatic synthesis? Bro, you sound like ChatGPT fell into a Brooklyn co-op.”

Chuck (mockingly):
“‘Do you want the triple-loop feedback with oat milk or almond?’”

[The trio stands there, momentarily flustered. The scoreboard above flashes: “White Enlightenment Energy – 0, Inside the NBA – ∞.”]

Overtime 15: Claire Goes Nuclear

Claire (crossing her arms, eyes flashing orange):
“Alright. You wanna talk whiteness? Who built the damn paradigm y’all hoop in? You think the Newtonian warframe y’all been critiquing didn’t come from 18th-century powdered-wig Eurocentrism? We didn’t make the game, we jailbroke it.”

Shaq (grinning, arms wide):
“Yeah, but you jailbroke it like some kids who just discovered Derrida and oat milk.”

Kenny (nodding, fake serious):
“Y’all didn’t jailbreak the game. You gentrified it.”

[Adam bursts out laughing. Even Ben cracks a smile. Claire just stares, hands on her hips, like she’s deciding whether or not to hex the whole studio.]

Overtime 16: Adam Hits Back (But Like, Meta-Ironically)

Adam (grinning, pointing at Shaq):
“Okay, Shaq. Big talk from a dude who literally was the military-industrial complex for like 10 years. You had more defense contracts than a Raytheon convention.”

Shaq (nodding, serious as death):
“And I looked good doin’ it. Can’t say the same for y’all lookin’ like you’re about to start a book club for people who think Foucault was ‘too mainstream.’”

Chuck (laughing):
“Y’all ain’t hoopin’, y’all discourse-ing. That’s why you gettin’ cooked.”

EJ (calmly, like the voice of God):
“Let’s not pretend Adam didn’t just try to abstract whiteness out of existence like it was patch notes. Bro said, ‘Race is just an outdated user interface.’”

Kenny (grinning):
“Yeah, Adam. You didn’t solve whiteness, you just turned it into a Google Doc with too many collaborators.”

Overtime 17: The Trash Talk Hits Cosmic Levels

Claire (dryly):
“Cool. Let’s see how funny y’all are when the Chaos Manual uploads your soul metadata to the cloud.”

Shaq (unfazed):
“Metadata? Girl, you still runnin’ on iOS whiteness 3.0.”

Chuck:
“That’s why y’all can’t hoop! All theory, no practice. Y’all would break an ankle just tryin’ to step off the dialectic.”

[Ben, finally, just starts laughing. He gets it now. The Game isn’t just gods and paradigms. It’s play. It’s shit-talking as spiritual practice. He looks over at Adam, who’s already smiling like someone who knew the joke before it was even told.]

Overtime 18: Infinite Play, Infinite Roasts

EJ (grinning, looking directly into the camera):
“And that’s the lesson, folks. The Infinite Game ain’t just abstract theory and paradigm shifts. It’s vibes. It’s banter. It’s talking shit until the heat death of the universe.”

Shaq (nodding, serious as ever):
“Y’all ain’t gods until you can take the roast and keep playin’. You wanna abstract over NATO? Cool. But if you can’t survive Inside the NBA, you ain’t ready for the big leagues.”

[The broadcast freezes. Then glitches. Then reboots. The studio turns into an Escher painting of basketball courts folding into kaleidoscopic infinity. The crew keeps talking. The game never ends. And somewhere, deep in the fabric of the cosmos, a neon sign flickers on.]

My moronic ass thought the gardener was coming at 8am today… but that’s next week. And I didn’t realise it was next week til I was dressed and teeth brushed etc and then thought “…wait” but oh well, I want to be getting up at that time each day anyway. 

Last night was… not fun. I don’t really want to write about it. He was asking if I even want this and if I even like him and everything he said was entirely valid and I don’t know. I don’t want to rehash it all now. Not when I have a meeting in twenty minutes. He was too sweet to me at the end, I didn’t deserve it. I’m just so tired of all of this. Not of him or us, just… *everything*. I need to be more upfront with my therapist. I’m going to try be braver today. 

It’s rainy and cold and grey. 

Note: High protein almond milk makes for a miserable coffee. I tipped it out. Bye bye $2.20 worth of pods. 

Therapy today was… ha. Ha ha ha ha. I had a break down. I think I dehydrated myself from the tears during and lord knows any liquid left in my body after that I cried out after the session. I wrote a list and mentioned a few things: 

* Why don’t I do things? Why do I struggle to follow through with everything? 
* I don’t think I’m as upfront or as honest as I could be in our sessions and I’m still holding back in some areas. 
* The work secondment situation but I asked if we can talk about that next time not this time. 

And then I told her and little more frankly about how I have times I don’t want to be here anymore, and how I have said I don’t ever feel like that now but I do. And sometimes a lot. I fell asleep last night thinking about it. She knows I’ve been sort of unstable in the past like when I was in the UK but again, not the full extent. And I haven’t said I still feel like that now. I don’t bring it up because I know I won’t do anything so it doesn’t seem important but she said it’s very important so… hm. I just think they take it the wrong way, I say I have those sorts of thoughts and they go all dramatic on it. Like no, I’ve had these thoughts for a very long time, and look I’m still here. I’m not about to fling myself off a bridge so it’s fine and you won’t get in trouble for anything. Except sometimes I think very seriously about it. Even very recently, maybe a week or two ago. I can feel surface level fine and dandy but I just feel like I have this deep dark chasm inside of me that’s sucking it all up. I feel like if I were a colour I would be grey. Not a pretty dove grey or a silvery chrome or anything, like a bleak one toned flat mid grey. Anyway. We talked but we didn’t get far because I kept crying like a bloody baby. 

I brought up how I can’t do anything and she said we can find out more after my psychiatrist appointment but that she suspects I have adhd or linked behaviours at the very least - she’s mentioned this before so it isn’t just Andy that mentioned it - but anyway she said there is a thing that’s commonly known as adhd paralysis and that a very key aspect of this is the sheer inability to turn intention into action - WHO DOES THIS SOUND LIKE - so we didn’t have much time left by this point but we agreed to talk this over more in a session soon so I can better learn to manage it. She said we’ve gone over this before in a different way early on - different because the adhd potential wasn’t a factor then I guess because it was early early idk. I’m not making sense. But basically I just spent $200 to cry and apologise for like forty minutes. Cool. Idk what happened, I do cry in sessions even though godddddd I try keep it in - partly because I detest crying for people and partly because once I start I sometimes find it difficult to gather myself. Anyway I was bawling my eyes out. I was talking about how I’m holding back and how I feel like I will never get better and god I had the wobbly cracking voice and I could feel my bottom lip quivering and if I wasn’t so ripped apart inside it would have been comical. I was also sobbing his name like “and - sniff sniff - Andy’s so - wahhhhhh - good to me” etc. Christ. Anyway. I told her I want to be more open and less in denial and that I still struggle to share things so she’s allowed to probe further when she thinks she can and I’m going to try and just say things without thought of consequence. 

The call wait time today for me provider was ridiculous - 11th in line or something. And the last time I called I got disconnected twice, MAYBE even thrice. I love the word thrice. So I hung up and have emailed them, I think I can better communicate my issues that way too. 

I don’t feel great. I cried again. Not like earlier though, I suspect my tear ducts packed up and went home for the day. 

Weekend time. Thank god.

I picked an out-and-back route on the Hamilton - Brantford - Port Dover rail trail (Ontario / Canada), which is readily reachable by region train. 200km / 1383m of elevation and 70% unpaved. This is a well maintained gravel trail which despite its rather uninspiring flatness for the middle portion of the route, does contain some good hill climbing at the start in Hamilton (and a bit on the way back from Port Dover).

**Getting There:**  
This route is easily reachable from Toronto on the Lakeshore West GO line. Just be aware that on weekends, the earliest train westbound from Union Station doesn't depart until 8:44AM, which is late for a ride of this distance. If you want to leave earlier, you're stuck using the #18 GO bus from Union, which starts at 6:40AM, but you aren't guaranteed a spot for your bicycle.

Alternatively, drive and park at the Hamilton Bayfront Park Parking Lot (free parking). This does have the advantage of letting you leave earlier, and the parking lot connects directly with the Waterfront Trail.

**Trip Report:**  
Caught the earliest train from Toronto Union to Hamilton West Harbour, which as noted earlier gave me a time disadvantage, arriving just after 10:05AM.

A brisk ride around the waterfront brought me into town, and I stopped to grab a bagel and coffee before continuing to the railtrail start. The trail's big incline out of Hamilton gave me a chance to get warmed in the cold weather.

The \~45km ride from Hamilton-Brantford was fairly quick as the gravel was well maintained and the elevation tapered off.  I stopped for food at 1:15PM, and pounded back 2 slices of greasy pizza before getting back in the saddle. This would turn out to be a major mistake, as within 15 minutes I was cramping badly and had to drop down to below the 15kmph minimum pace I needed to meet the time limit. Eventually I'd actually have to dismount and walk the bike for about a kilometer. I started noticing my bike fit issues at this point; my reach was too far and this stretched/angled position was exacerbating my cramping issues.

By about 2:30pm I was making good time again, but had only made it about a dozen km past Brantford up to this point. The weather and scenery were great however, so my spirits were good and I completed the remaining \~45km to Port Dover by 4:45pm. My left knee for whatever reason was starting to hurt by this point. Learning a *bit* from my previous mistake, I had a much smaller meal at the Dairy Queen, and made sure to go easy on the burger and heavier on the sugar (icecream). I also took some food to go rather than eat all at once.

[Entering Port Dover](https://preview.redd.it/87o5byuerfke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50d4951e5d97b4e13ec65d6efa6c9639f5944d1f)

Getting back on the bike, my knee had really started to act up and the ride up the slope out of Port Dover was a trudge. I knew at this point I'd definitely be riding a *lot* through the dark. The ride back was mostly a blur but I did manage to make good time on the flats, but fatigue really started to set in, and fuelling became a challenge. I was relying on granola & fruit bars, but definitely did not pack enough.

By the time I was 1/2 past Brantford (\~175km), thankfully the large downhill slope toke over and I could rest my knee. Unfortunately, the temp had dropped down to -1C and this + higher speeds meant I really started to get cold; despite switching to my thicker socks and gloves, I was not able to keep my toes and fingers and even body properly warm - probably due to fatigue. I also ran out of granola bars at this point so I was really fighting 'bonk'. The last 2-3km I was fighting hard to keep over walking speed and as I rolled into the train station at 10:45pm I had officially bonked hard. I was glad I made it when I did, in time to catch the last train of the evening AND because my headlamp was down to it's low-battery warning (oops).

**Total Time / Distance:** 12h51m / 201km (yay! made the cut)

**Lessons Learned**

* **Fuelling is Key:** Both the pacing AND the type of food! After cramping so badly, I'll be switching to frequent snacking without gorging, and also experiment with moving more toward simple carbs and away from fats/proteins/complex carbs on long rides. Real food still at food stops, but... just a bit lighter next time. And I will be packing more food/carbs so I won't get caught out with too little again.
* **Enough Batteries & Lights:** Without a dynamo I should have brought a 2nd light, or one that charged while running. I did bring a battery bank too - but my phone drained that surprisingly quickly while running GPS constantly.  So - more batteries and lights next time, with a better margin for extra runtime.
* **Bike Fit:** So important. This was a relatively new bike, and while I had been riding it daily, this was my first >60km ride with it. It turns out the sizing was all wrong for reach; this threw off my seat adjustment as well when I tried to set it to something comfortable. This definitely was the cause of my eventual knee pain on the ride, AND it exacerbated my cramping due to a stretched position. I ended up swapping the stem entirely for a much shorter one after this ride.
* **Proper Clothing:** I had rain gear and extra socks, but hadn't planned on how cold one could feel once they 'bonked' out. I shouldn't have tried to skimp on packed weight; an extra-thick pair of socks, a pair winter gloves, and a 2nd sweater would have done wonders.",1,1740121011.0,torontobiking,0,1.0,False

Since September been having “episodes” where my heart feels like it’s large, working REALLY hard, and POUNDING in my chest. It comes with sometimes tinges of pain, definitely “pressure” and/or slight soreness (not like excruciating pain or anything), and it happens when I’m doing nothing.
Dismissed by 3 Drs as “it’s probably just your anxiety”. 4th dr finally sent me to cardiologist. 

After first testing he said I’ve had at least one heart attack. And after all my tests so far, this is what he has listed as my diagnosis summary:

Anteroseptal Infarct.
Grade 1 DD, consistent with impaired relaxation.
Mitral valve prolapse. Trace MR and TR. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 20 mmHg.

We’re doing a stress test and another heart monitor that I wear for 2 weeks to see if we can catch one of these “episodes”, he wants to see if the episodes are affecting the prolapsed valve. Then go from there. 

I guess im just looking for any insight, advice, etc. This is freaking me out but trying not to stress but it all seems so strange at my age. Thank you for any input!! 🫀🩷",1,1740120750.0,Cardiomyopathy,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

I kept waiting for something to change, but all that changed was the date. I was nearing the end of a two-year sentence at Hewson College, but I still didn’t know what the hell I was doing with my life. Who’s supposed to prepare you for that? You either have some survival instinct, or you don’t. All I’ve ever tried to survive was the next high. I was a full-blown burnout in high school. The fact that I even graduated proves how broken the system is. Fat, bearded, barely scraping by. Smelled like reserve cigarettes and greasy hair. Took the easiest classes and still managed to fuck up. And somehow, they let me graduate. 

I walked into Hewson thinking I’d find something—anything—that made sense. Instead, I found a sea of other lost bodies, staring blankly at lecture slides, watching the clock, waiting for some revelation that never came. I made one friend my first year, and even that was just killing time between classes. We didn’t hang out, didn’t talk about dreams or ambitions, because we didn’t have any. Everyone was antisocial unless they lived on campus. You go to your lecture, you go home. Rinse and repeat. No eye contact. No conversation. Just the sound of laptop keyboards and pens scratching half-assed notes onto dollar-store notebooks. 

I’ve always been antisocial—not by choice—but I thought college might force me out of it. It didn’t. I spent my first year feeling emptier than ever. 

My mom still dropped me off and picked me up like I was twelve. Sitting in the passenger seat, half-asleep, coffee breath mixing with the morning air. No growing up. No sense of independence. Just another kid getting shuttled from point A to point B. It all felt pointless. Like the diploma we were all supposedly working toward. 

I was in the General Arts and Sciences program—the burnout program. They hand it to you when you don’t know what you want, and your parents think college might fix that. For me, that was my dad. My mom just wanted me to be happy, but I was too far gone for that. So, instead of working some dead-end job, I chose to waste a few more years in this general mess. 

My dad paid for all of it, which ate at me. Most of the other students in the program were on government subsidies, probably the first in their family to even think about college. Then there was me: a privileged burnout. My mom dropping me off like I needed a babysitter, wasting my dad’s money. He’s not rich—he’s just a regular guy, and he had faith in me. So, I figured, if he’s throwing money at this, I might as well try. So I did. 

Somehow, I made honor roll both semesters. My parents couldn’t believe it. But let’s be real—it wasn’t a sign of some hidden genius. It was a sign the program was a joke. A participation trophy. My mom even stuck the letters from the dean on the fridge, right next to the grocery list. I was reminded of my “brilliance” every time I got the munchies. 

The General Arts and Sciences program? It’s for people who can’t figure shit out. It’s a two-year crash course in mediocrity, where you learn just enough about everything but not enough to care. The professors all sound like they’re bored of their own lectures. The chairs are hard, the rooms are cold, the walls are bare. There’s no one to smoke with, and the bathrooms always smell like stale piss and hand sanitizer. 

The idea is that something might spark, and then you transfer the credits toward something useful. I thought maybe I could become a social worker, like my dad, if I played my cards right. Maybe. But mostly, I was just drifting, waiting for some big revelation that never came. 

But if college wasn’t going to change me, maybe love or sex would. 

A handful of girls showed interest back in high school, but none of it went anywhere. I was too fucking scared. The thought of being close to someone—of them getting too close to me—made my skin crawl. I had a bit of sexual trauma from when I was a kid, about six or seven, when a girl a few years older than me took advantage. I wasn’t worth their time, and deep down, I knew it. The girls who wanted me weren’t after me, they were after whoever could get them off. They didn’t care who I was. I was just a pair of cock and balls. 

There was one girl, though, in Grade 9. She was angelic. We never dated, but we held hands a bit and said we loved each other. I really meant it. She cut me out of her life once she climbed a rung in popularity. She was too damn good for me, but I had a taste. And for a brief moment, I thought maybe that’s all I needed—a little piece of something real. 

I had a lot of girls send me unprovoked nudes on Snapchat throughout high school, too. I really enjoyed that because it felt like a safe little world I could hide in. They never asked for anything in return—never expected me to reciprocate with a picture of my own. It was just them, showing off their little rebellions, trying to find their sexuality, and me, the happy little voyeur. It was fun. There was one girl who sent me stuff almost every hour. I figured I must be halfway decent looking for anyone to show themselves this much to me. 

And that was about the extent of my sexual prowess until one unfaithful night. That’s when everything changed—for the worse. I never saw it coming, and neither did she. ",1,1740120669.0,KeepWriting,2,1.0,False

Meeting & Initial Connection

I met this incredibly handsome man on July 4th last year at a party in LA. We instantly connected, and I decided to leave with him and his friends to another party. In the car, I sat on his lap, feeling surprisingly comfortable.

At the second party, he socialized while staying close to me. At some point, I left abruptly, but we had already exchanged numbers. He reached out, wanting to see me again, but I was exhausted and declined. Since he didn’t live in LA, I figured that was it.

He called me immediately after I left, asking where I was. I told him we could stay in touch. He tried reaching out the next day, but I had already left for Mexico and didn’t have reception. Later, we exchanged a few messages and attempted to meet for a hike, but I canceled. When I reached out again, he invited me to Phoenix, but it felt too focused on the physical aspect, so I declined.

Each time I messaged him, though, he responded quickly.

Reconnecting for Palm Springs

A few days before Valentine’s Day, I sent him a link to a party. He immediately replied, saying he’d sign up because he wanted to see me. He also sent me another event link for my thoughts. I told him I’d get back to him the next day, which I did, saying it sounded exciting.

We coordinated how I’d get to Palm Springs, where he was going. He had a friend driving down and arranged for me to be picked up. I was a little nervous at first, but the ride was fun—we listened to music and laughed.

When we arrived at the airport to pick him up, I felt excited to see him again after so many months. In the car, he got hungry, so we stopped for food before heading to the Airbnb.

Palm Springs Weekend

As we walked around the Airbnb, he tried to kiss me outside, but I didn’t reciprocate. Later, we got into the jacuzzi, where we kissed, and while I enjoyed it, I wasn’t particularly turned on. When others joined us, we stopped kissing and moved on with the evening.

The next morning, I woke up early and tried to be quiet. He told me to come back to bed, but I didn’t. Instead, he grumpily told me to go out so he could sleep, which made me laugh. Later, he texted me to come back, and when I did, we made out, had sex, and got ready for the day.

The host prepared breakfast and explained the day’s itinerary, which included taking mushrooms. I was nervous since I’d never tried them before.

We spent the day exploring, and he was obsessed with taking pictures of himself—so much so that it annoyed the others. He insisted on taking pictures of me but never took any together and never used his own phone for it.

At one point, we walked past a store selling earrings, and he asked if I liked a pair. I said yes, and he suggested I try them on. Then, he asked if I wanted them, went into the store to check the price, and suddenly decided not to buy them. That moment felt uncomfortable and awkward. To shift the mood, I said, “You know what would make me happy right now? A coffee.” He handed me his card and told me to get one.

While I was in line, he got me a lip balm for my dry lips. He kept checking on me, which I found cute.

Mushrooms & Emotional Conversations

Later, we took mushroom chocolate on a mountain hike. When the host told him to help me climb, he seemed awkward, like he didn’t know how to act. Eventually, another guy helped me as well.

Back at the Airbnb, I wanted some alone time in my room. He kept checking in on me, teasing me about being on my phone. When I told him I was just taking notes, he offered to get me a pen and paper. I jokingly asked, “What are you even doing here?” He giggled and left.

He returned again, asking what I was writing. I told him it was about love. He then mentioned thinking about our past and admitted he had his guard up. I told him, “If you want love in your life, you have to take risks.” As we held hands, I felt a strong energy between us, but he brushed it off, saying, “Don’t take it too seriously.”

I asked if I could give him a hug, and he hesitated but said okay. When I hugged him again, he got awkward and left.

That night, in the jacuzzi, he kept trying to touch my feet for physical contact. Later, when I left the jacuzzi, I gave him a playful Spider-Man-style kiss before heading inside.

Shifting Energy & Departure

Inside, I was talking to another guy when he suddenly walked past us and grabbed chips and salsa. It felt like he did it on purpose, maybe not liking that I was talking to someone else.

When I showered later, he kept checking in, asking when I was coming back. His sudden attention shift surprised me.

That night, he invited me to sit with him, cuddling under a blanket while he played me a meditation song. It was a sweet moment.

The next morning, we started packing. While I was outside, he playfully tried to scare me. We had one last intimate moment, but afterward, he left the room abruptly, which felt cold.

As we were about to leave, I asked about our plans for the day. He casually said we could get lunch and spend time together. But once we were all outside, he suddenly announced, “Hey guys, just drop me at the airport. I changed my plans—I’m flying to Dallas to see my family.”

He hadn’t told anyone beforehand, not even me. It was disappointing, considering how nice the weekend had been. But I reminded myself that we weren’t in a relationship and I had no expectations.

Goodbye at the Airport

On the drive to the airport, he seemed nervous. His hands were sweaty, and he kept rubbing my leg. He asked, “How are you?” I said I was fine, but inside, I felt sad and disappointed.

He held my hand and told me he had a great time. I said the same. He mentioned his dad was sick and showed me some things on his phone. At one point, he took my phone out of my hand while I was watching something, trying to “fix” something for me, which I found odd.

How do I find out if this is a platonic friendship or something more?,"So me and my bf have been best friends since college and we came in a relationship only 2 years back! It has a been a very tricky relationship with too many downs but we have managed to survive through! Anyway my bf has this hybrid office system where he has to go to office for 2 days a week and now it has changed to 3 days a week! I on the other hand have a wfh job and only shifted to this city away from my hometown to be with him! He had a very casual attitude towards his colleagues always like not giving them too much attention and hanging out only sometimes like it never bothered me before but now a girl has joined his team who he has to closely work with because she needs help all the time and it all started with she is dumb, I need to support her to make her stay and now it has reached to a level of she is kind of his best friend now! 

So a little back story, I was having issues with his sudden extra involvement in office since jan end but then I had to leave for my hometown for my sister’s marriage for 12 days and these 12 days have changed everything! Since I came back my bf now tells me he doesn’t feel valued in our relationship and feels disposable to which I said I would work upon but he still says this might cause the end of our relationship and all of this is very out of character for him cause given our time together he has always said he doesn’t believe in breaking up and feels if two people love each other there is nothing they cannot do to keep the relationship! Anyways coming back to the point I am finding out things like the office colleague is sending him gifts now and he didn’t receive them because was sleeping beside me so she calls up like a 10 times and when he answers he goes (in his sleepy voice)- “Hiii, good morning” and she goes like - “Why did you return the parcel? Don’t talk to me now”. All this just felt a little too much for a colleague interaction to me! Then in the middle of the day while on a office call huddle she starts mentioning how one guy in office is teasing her with my bf’s name because now he picks and drops her home and this was a shocker for me I didn’t know it was happening! This coming from a person who never hides things from me, he tells me things he shouldn’t probably but this he never told me! 
Then the other day we were in the market returning back from the doctor’s(Guess what I have been sick af since my return)and he sees her and goes all excited to just run after her but as I was also there he paused for a second and asked may I go, seeing his excitement I said yes why would I stop you! He went away and I was waiting for him on the side, usually he introduces me to his colleagues and friends always but this time he didn’t and to top that he calls me and tells me to go back alone as he might go to coffee with her and some guy! I felt hurt, I was sick and he didn’t care to even comeback home with me!
So to sum up I have been back for only a week and there have been so many incidents that make me doubt if he has given up on this relationship because he is feeling something with her! He has said things like I like spending time with her because it is fun, what we do is fight all the time! He has even started saying stuff like she is my Red - which means you met someone for a very short time and they have a large impact on your life! He even says I vibe with her a lot and we have so much in common! He has now started asking me about sitcoms which I always told him to watch but now that she suggests them he is willing to do so! I don’t know if I am overthinking or is it normal because it hasn’t happened before in our relationship and I have never seen him this involved with another girl!

Although I do not have children of my own, my nieces and nephews participate in the program. Our program is relatively small, comprising about 13 children, with only two teachers. One teacher also fulfills other roles within the church, which occasionally requires her to be called away, making me the primary teacher.

Over the last month and a half, I have been covering for her entirely, as she has been preoccupied with various trips and activities. I informed her in advance that I would be unavailable for the last two weeks, and she acknowledged my message. However, there was a miscommunication last week when no one covered Sunday school due to a significant church meeting. While mistakes can occur, it is important to remember that we are all volunteers.

Following this incident, a parent sent an email expressing dissatisfaction.

Good afternoon, 

I wanted to reach out to you and advise that last Sunday there was no communication with us parents that there was no Sunday school. It would be nice if we can have better communication going forward.

 I received it after an especially demanding period at work, and I did not react well. I frequently handle curriculum preparation, often purchasing materials out of my own pocket, managing behavioral issues among the children, and providing refreshments for coffee hour each month. Additionally, I have organized the Christmas program for the past two years and developed enjoyable programs for the children, as well as an end-of-year event for the entire church. 

In response to the parent’s email, I replied, 

 You are right. Between my other responsibilities and this I’m stretched too thin. We could really use a volunteer like you with younger kids. I’ll pass the reins to you. I’m resigning my position with Sunday School and the Education committee. Enjoy!
My name 
Teamwork makes the dream work 

I replied all which including the other volunteer and the pastor and the parent. Many friends and family members have expressed their support for my decision to stand up for myself, suggesting that I often allow myself to be taken advantage of. However, the other three recipients of my email did not respond, which I find disheartening, especially considering my long-standing commitment of six years. It seems there is a lack of respect and appreciation for the time and resources I invest in the children and the program.",3,1740119382.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

While not an official event, I wanted to see if I could make the 13.5hr brevet time limit for such a distance.

[Hamilton - Brantford - Port Dover](https://preview.redd.it/tc7wew83qfke1.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3a2091ca82ca780a1b0789bdeb9859c01dd3b4)

I picked an out-and-back route on the Hamilton - Brantford - Port Dover rail trail (Ontario / Canada), which is readily reachable by region train. 200km / 1383m of elevation and 70% unpaved.

**Trip Report:**  
Caught the earliest train from Toronto Union to Hamilton West Harbour, which unfortunately dropped me off just after 10:05AM which gave me a time disadvantage.

https://preview.redd.it/vg1et3q9qfke1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26b35bb91519eea25ffb90dbee30ded9acca4a5a

A brisk ride around the waterfront brought me into town, and I stopped to grab a bagel and coffee before continuing to the railtrail start. The trail's big incline out of Hamilton gave me a chance to get warmed in the cold weather and make a few final bike-fit adjustments (more on this later).

[Riding up into Hamilton from the lakeshore](https://preview.redd.it/deqv3swtqfke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbb2ef1a5299d32f8fc22cf800daea41dc80d42c)

The \~45km ride from Hamilton-Brantford was fairly quick as the gravel was well maintained and the elevation tapered off. I stopped for food at 1:15PM, and pounded back 2 slices of greasy pizza before getting back in the saddle. This would turn out to be a major mistake, as within 15 minutes I was cramping badly and had to drop down to below the 15kmph minimum pace I needed to meet the time limit. Eventually I'd actually have to dismount and walk the bike for about a kilometer. I started noticing my bike fit issues at this point; my reach was too far and this stretched/angled position was exacerbating my cramping issues.

[Entering Brantford from the East](https://preview.redd.it/ld158xe7rfke1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45b90a471f55e35534751ee0a9aef1e94cb3868f)

By about 2:30pm I was making good time again, but had only made it about a dozen km past Brantford up to this point. The weather and scenery were great however, so my spirits were good and I completed the remaining \~45km to Port Dover by 4:45pm. My left knee for whatever reason was starting to hurt by this point. Learning a *bit* from my previous mistake, I had a much smaller meal at the Dairy Queen, and made sure to go easy on the burger and heavier on the sugar (icecream). I also took some food to go rather than eat all at once.

[Entering Port Dover](https://preview.redd.it/87o5byuerfke1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50d4951e5d97b4e13ec65d6efa6c9639f5944d1f)

Getting back on the bike, my knee had really started to act up and the ride up the slope out of Port Dover was a trudge. I knew at this point I'd definitely be riding a *lot* through the dark. The ride back was mostly a blur but I did manage to make good time on the flats, but fatigue really started to set in, and fuelling became a challenge. I was relying on granola & fruit bars, but definitely did not pack enough.

By the time I was 1/2 past Brantford (\~175km), thankfully the large downhill slope toke over and I could rest my knee. Unfortunately, the temp had dropped down to -1C and this + higher speeds meant I really started to get cold; despite switching to my thicker socks and gloves, I was not able to keep my toes and fingers and even body properly warm - probably due to fatigue. I also ran out of granola bars at this point so I was really fighting 'bonk'. The last 2-3km I was fighting hard to keep over walking speed and as I rolled into the train station at 10:45pm I had officially bonked hard. I was glad I made it when I did, in time to catch the last train of the evening AND because my headlamp was down to it's low-battery warning (oops).

**Total Time / Distance:** 12h51m / 201km (yay! made the cut)

**Lessons Learned**

* **Fuelling is Key:** Both the pacing AND the type of food! After cramping so badly, I'll be switching to frequent snacking without gorging, and also experiment with moving more toward simple carbs and away from fats/proteins/complex carbs on long rides. Real food still at food stops, but... just a bit lighter next time. And I will be packing more food/carbs so I won't get caught out with too little again.
* **Enough Batteries & Lights:** Without a dynamo I should have brought a 2nd light, or one that charged while running. I did bring a battery bank too - but my phone drained that surprisingly quickly while running GPS constantly.  So - more batteries and lights next time, with a better margin for extra runtime.
* **Bike Fit:** So important. This was a relatively new bike, and while I had been riding it daily, this was my first >60km ride with it. It turns out the sizing was all wrong for reach; this threw off my seat adjustment as well when I tried to set it to something comfortable. This definitely was the cause of my eventual knee pain on the ride, AND it exacerbated my cramping due to a stretched position.
* **Proper Clothing:** I had rain gear and extra socks, but hadn't planned on how cold one could feel once they 'bonked' out. I shouldn't have tried to skimp on packed weight; an extra-thick pair of socks, a pair winter gloves, and a 2nd sweater would have done wonders.",11,1740119341.0,randonneuring,3,1.0,False

1iukey2,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/1iukey2/looking_for_a_roommate/,Looking for a roommate,"I’m planning to move to the S. Bel Air/Belcamp/Aberdeen area by April. I’m interested in renting an apartment in one of the new luxury developments (what can I say, I love nice appliances and whatnot). For example, I toured James Run Apartments recently and came out pretty impressed. I could pretty easily rent a 1BR on my own, but would be interested in a 2BR or maybe even 3 BR situation (a) to save more money and (b) because being alone in a new town kind of sucks. 

The arrangement I have in mind: 
- A 2 BR would probably come out to $1,000 per person and a 3 BR would likely come out to $900 per person (assuming 2 and 3 people respectively).
- I have a nice TV, sofa, rug and coffee table that I’m happy to provide for the common space, as long as people are respectful of that space.
- Utilities will be split equally.
- My dog will have free rein in my room and in common areas, but others are obviously welcome to keep him out of their rooms. Obviously, I take full responsibility for my dog.
- Other pets are welcome as long as they are well trained + align with building policies AND again, keep in mind that I have a big dog and idk how he’d respond to other animals in his living space long-term.
- Everyone must be willing to contribute to having a cleaner come at least twice per month, as well as do their part to keep common spaces clean (and individual rooms/bathrooms not gross).
- Trust is important for this to work. Must pass the apartment’s background checks, be able to prove stable employment that pays for your part of rent and commit to ONE year. 
- No parties unless all occupants agree.
- Keep your hook ups in your rooms, don’t be gross in the common areas (especially the kitchen island :)) 
- No weed (stinky af) or illegal drugs in the apartment.
- Down to pool money for joint groceries or shop independently, as long as people are respectful (i.e. don’t be a moocher).
- The usual don’t be a dick or a creep stuff. 
- idc about gender, but no couples unless each person pays an equal share of the rent (i.e. if the rent is $3,000 for a 3 BR and two people + a couple live in the unit, the rent would be split four ways equally).
- no children, strongly prefer people in my age range (23-30)

About me: 26 year old male, work remote and have a big, but very well-trained, dog (I don’t go out too much). I make a little over $100k and am pretty securely employed. My girlfriend lives in NYC right now and will visit once per month for anywhere between a weekend and a week. My dog and I will also be gone once per month for a weekend (maybe a bit longer) to visit her in NYC. 

DM me if this sounds like something you might be interested in.

I would say 50% of the time I end up asking for it to be remade.

On the bad days it's like a brick of ice, very light in color, almost white and when I take one sip it seems all the ""espresso"" is gone, also super sweet. 
I've had baristas scoff at me when I ask for it to be remade, I've had it intentionally remade wrong the second time for questioning if all 4 espresso shots ended up in the drink, I've also had it made correctly the second time without me having to say what was wrong with the first one. I've changed locations several times just hoping I don't have to keep asking for remakes, it makes me feel like such an asshole because I know they deal with enough already. I'm always so patient, I am never rude when I ask for remakes and I stilllll tip on the days it's wrong 😭

Dear [Agent],

(Personalization here).

When Jessica, an accomplished young environmental analyst, is rudely cut in line for coffee, she chalks it up to the rudeness of random strangers everywhere. Unbeknownst to her, Mr. Rude Guy, aka Mark, will shortly be introducing himself as her new boss. As Jessica learns to navigate the hot and cold relationship, we learn one thing for sure. Every time it turns cold, it’s because Jessica has done something crazy.

Jessica is an anxious overthinking type, mirroring the most insane little voices we’ve ever had in our heads. Have you ever wanted to throw caution to the wind and just stalk your crush, following him to the Everglades? Have you ever thought about maybe lying and not confessing to crashing into your boss’s parked car? The difference is, most of us can stop ourselves from acting on our tiniest little impulses- the ones we quickly stuff away to remind ourselves that we are good people.

My book, I Think I Love You, has the workplace tension of The Hating Game by Sally Thorne and the emotional depth of Beach Read by Emily Henry. A 62,000-word novel, it’s what I like to call a romantic workplace comedy. As an HR Manager, I loved both writing what I know, and not having to resolve it from the HR office.

I hope you love reading it as much as I loved writing it. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
