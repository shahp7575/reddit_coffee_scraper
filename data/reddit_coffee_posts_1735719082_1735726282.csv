1hr06ej,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hr06ej/whats_done_is_done_but_was_i_the_ah/,"What‚Äôs done is done, but was I the AH??","
I posted the below to my Facebook  after leaving my wife of 8 years due to her treatment of myself. I‚Äôve received both criticism and commendation for my actions, but wanted to get the true answer from the one source that everyone trusts - no, not Wikipedia - here on Reddit.

My question for you is twofold. Was I an AH for posting this, and was I an AH for leaving?

I look forward to the probably roasting.


My friends and family 

By the end of this year, my Facebook will be locked down for good. The last four months have been tumultuous and have shown whom is and is not a friend. I acknowledge that many of you are unaware of these events, and I am sorry that this is how you will find out. I may lose friends over this, and unfortunately, I already have.
I am tired, I am exhausted, and I have just had enough of people jumping to conclusions without seeing both sides of the coin that is the truth.
For those that have already made up their mind, that is your decision, and I respect you for that. For those that have reached out, your kindness and support has been needed, wanted, and I cannot thank you enough.
I love you all dearly, but I must, for once, truly put myself first, and set my side of this saga out for all to see:

For the last 17 years or so, I have dedicated my life to Sara, she was my partner, my wife, and I had hoped, my future. I saw our life together and worked hard to provide her with anything that she wanted. I chose Sara over friends that I had known longer, fought against family for her, strived to prove that the love that I had for her was real, and tried to convince others that she was not as bad as they thought.

I never saw how much of a hold Sara had on me. Visiting friends was a fight, visiting family was worse ‚Äì they were always ‚Äúusing me‚Äù too inconvenient, too nasty, or we could not afford the fuel. I very rarely went out alone. I should have seen what was happening ‚Äì but I did not. I gave up many opportunities and dreams that I had, so Sara would be content and comfortable where we lived. Railway and mining work were out of the question, and so was moving to a country town ‚Äì let alone to the other end of Canberra. North Canberra was ‚Äòsafe‚Äô and if we moved anywhere else, she would lose her independence, if I went away for work, Sara would not feel safe. Everything had to be ‚Äòsafe‚Äô for Sara.

Over the years ‚Äì and it took years - we shared everything. Bank accounts, subscriptions, phones, emails, eBay, and Facebook.  I thought that was normal - expected. I could never see just how much control that trust had given Sara. I made the money, Sara got her pension, and Sara used it all to pay the bills, insurance, car rego, phones, and more - all of which was in her name - to give her independence and something she could control. A mistake on my part, perhaps.

I supported Sara as she looked for and gained employment, either by herself or with my aid, watched proudly as she thrived, and helped pick up the pieces after she was let go, time and again. Every time her mental health took a dive, I would pick her up and help her gain her confidence again. It was a frequent occurrence, and occasionally the threat of suicide was significant.

In 2014, she supported me through the grief of losing my grandfather, helped me and my family clean up his apartment. None of which was expected, but for which I am grateful. She did this again, just last year, after my father was found deceased in his home. I will forever be grateful for Sara‚Äôs help cleaning up the mess that his last hours had left.

Slowly, gradually, I was restricted and confined. I was berated for buying a coffee, or something that I wanted. I was unable to go out with friends or family by myself, because it was too expensive, or Sara was afraid of being left alone. She began to let her disabilities control her life, something that she said she would never do.

She would break down because the local supermarket did not have an accessible trolley that she could use in while in her wheelchair, or if a store wasn‚Äôt accessible. Bus drivers caught her wrath if the bus was not accessible. So did retail workers if head office did not have accessible POS terminals in that location. Sara became more literal, overbearing, more controlling. Our weeks and days were booked out, visits by and to family had to be organised months in advance, and nearly always caused an argument.
My life, my relationship - the marriage with the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, had gone from fun, and full of life, love, and laughter, to one that I never wanted, the was no freedom, no privacy, no independence, more arguments than laughter, and more tears than fun. Seventeen years of love, dedication, support, and trust was what I had given ‚Äì in return I was emotionally and financially abused and manipulated, my friends were forced away, I was alienated from my family. 
I was very much alone. 
The single best thing that Sara ever gave me, was my son - Peter.

And then, by social norms, this is where I messed up. I connected with someone, on a very deep, emotional, and personal level. 

It was over 15 months ago that we met online, playing Pathfinder where our characters got on like a house on fire, then we started gaming together online, we swapped numbers, and added each other on Facebook. After a few months of almost daily phone calls, we discovered that we lived similar lives, with similar families and experiences, similar dietary requirements due to similar churches that our families were involved with. We found in each other someone that understood the other and could provide support in a way no one else could. It is at this point that I should mention something important, this person ‚Äì let us call her ‚ÄòStella‚Äô is my best friend‚Äôs partner. They are both polyamorous, and yes, he‚Äôs okay with me dating his partner. 

They both decided to drive down to Canberra a couple of weeks before the anniversary of my father‚Äôs passing, because the same had happened to Stella a few years prior, and she knew that I needed a friend, and the support she could give. During their visit, Sara very much made herself the centre of attention. From showing off her jewellery, and comparing her disabilities to others, to guilting the three of us to do things that she wanted to do instead of letting them do what they wanted to do. A week after she left, we both revealed our feelings. And we fell for each other.

Hard.

We kept this discovery to ourselves, because I had no idea how to tell Sara about this startling development. That I was going to tell Sara, was certain, I just did not know how. Sara found out less than a week later, going through my messages to find dates for when I would be going to Queensland, to help my best friend and Stella, move back to Canberra.

After some discussion ‚Äì a very one sided because I had broken Sara‚Äôs trust, Sara agreed to let me explore something I had a lot of trouble with asking for - Polyamory. We had permission to date with - albeit with no intimacy, announced via a group video call between Stella, my best friend, Sara and myself. Many things were suggested, most of which from Sara came across as extraordinarily entitled ‚Äì things like becoming a babysitter for Peter, our son, Peter calling Stella ‚ÄúMum‚Äù, and Stella generally becoming a support worker for Sara. Even perhaps the cruellest; suggesting that we could all become a single family. Then, after some apparent self-reflection less than 48 hours later, Sara had me write a message to ‚ÄòStella‚Äô for her, revoking her permission for us to date, and why. 

The pain that message caused both Stella and I, was indescribable. Stella was doing all that she could to push me away, to try and salvage whatever was left of my marriage, to remove herself from the picture. That night, my best friend called me. Stella was going through a tough time back at home, this mess being a contributing factor, and my friend, he needed my help supporting her - Stella didn‚Äôt want me to fly up, but I flew up anyway - Sara wouldn‚Äôt let me drive, and I was going to get up there one way or another. It was a whirlwind trip, 18 hours or so, but it helped them both.

At the family gathering on the evening that I got back home, Sara started advising them that I was cheating on her. Three days later - a Tuesday - she had consulted her psychologist - sharing my private messages (between Stella and I) without any sort of permission (not just to her psychologist, but to as many people as she could within her support network), and presented me that evening, with a mutual friend by her side, a few ‚Äòoptions‚Äô on how things could proceed for our family. 

One, I could stay friends with Stella, nothing more, and Sara would have full access to my socials and phone ‚Äì everything.
Two, I could cut contact with Stella, and Sara would get full access to my socials and phone.
Three, we could separate, live in the same residence to raise our son, and as we would no longer be in a relationship, Sara would have no access to my socials and phone.
Or
Four, she ‚Äòremoves‚Äô herself permanently. This was brushed over quickly by Sara, but the connotations were obvious.

This was both an ultimatum and a bit of a dilemma. Option Four was certainly out of the question, Sara and I do have Peter after all, and no child deserves to lose their parent so young. Option Two was out, No one tells me who I can and cannot talk to or have as a friend. 

So I have two choices, remain ‚Äòjust friends‚Äô with this woman that I had fallen in love with, which meant that I would lose any scrap of privacy that I had left, that I had to fight to lose the happiness that I‚Äôd only just found, and take the very real chance that I‚Äôd never be able to keep that promise, 
Or
Separate from my wife, the mother of my two-and-a-half-year-old son and acknowledge the simple fact that no matter what I did, because of what I did, my marriage was almost inevitably over. With no freedom, no trust, and no happiness for either of us. 

I chose the latter and was forced then, and there, to sign a separation agreement ‚Äì which I still have not received a copy of.

I made my choice not because I wanted to leave, or to jump into the arms of another woman, but because this was the last straw. I just could not be in this relationship ‚Äì this marriage - anymore. In that moment, I had realised just how exhausted I was, how drained, melancholy, and abused I was. How much the last seventeen years had worn me down, had changed me, I just could not, anymore. I also saw that I would never be able to do as Sara had demanded. The feelings, the love, the connection that had developed between Stella and I were too deep and to give that up would be nearly impossible. It would be a promise that I could not keep.
I slept in the garage that night. I was on the floor, with my son‚Äôs old cot mattress, and a sleeping bag. Sara had a mutual friend over because she felt ‚Äòunsafe‚Äô. I was refused the bed, and the sofa was taken - yes, we had two sofas at the time but my home that evening had been filled with a cold animosity so palpable that it felt like hell itself had frozen over.

The next day - Wednesday - after work, our mutual friend was still there, as was the animosity. My mother-in-law was there too, so I decided to get my new ‚Äòroom‚Äô ready again, whilst passing through trying to be as ‚Äònormal‚Äô as the situation allowed. As I finished, my father-in-law arrived. I greeted him and walked him into the house. As it turns out, there were plans for a panel interview - an intervention in hindsight. For about two hours I was grilled, questioned, and judged. All of what I have said here was voiced, argued over, critiqued, and heard. Sara, her friend, and her parents on one side of the living room, and me, alone, on the other.

I was not swayed; I could not be. Everything that had happened, the trust I had broken, the hurt I had caused. My family that I had shattered. It was all irreparable. Time was called, some more family were invited over, and dinner was ordered. I was an emotional wreck, tear stained and red-eyed, Sara never showed a shred of emotion. I went to clean up before family and dinner arrived. I told Stella what was happening, and the next thing I knew, she was flying down to see me, to support me.

That night I had the sofa. Sara and our mutual friend shared the bed. The next day was a whirlwind of activity. I finished work, went home, I saw that my belongings were being boxed up, I gathered a week‚Äôs worth of clothes, and then left. I picked up Stella from the airport, then we spent the next three weeks couch surfing, and another two in a cheap motel, before finding somewhere to live. Stella had given more love, comfort, and support in those weeks than I had received in the years prior. 

Stella, this amazing woman that I had fallen for, and who had fallen for me, had jumped in a plane alone, with a massive amount of anxiety and a fear of flying, had come to me, and voluntarily spent the next month-and-a-bit HOMELESS, to support me. When we found a house to live in, she furnished the majority of the house, covered the rent advance and the bond, I never asked for any of this, never expected it, she just did it. She has been a massive pillar of support for me for about six months now, and a genuine friend for longer, she has shown genuine love, care, and concern for me. Without her, I would be miserable, in an abusive, toxic marriage, with a woman whom I thought genuinely loved me. 

The marriage and relationship I had with Sara had been reduced to nothing more than a business transaction since I was forced to sign the separation document. Stella and I have been followed, had our privacy violated, she has been cornered, I have been abused, we‚Äôve both been called liars, and had our reputations strewn across the ground and trodden into the mud. Hell, I didn‚Äôt even get the chance to break the news of the separation thanks to a Facebook post that had reached a full third of Canberra.

I‚Äôm almost on my feet again now, We have a home, money is tight, but I‚Äôm, sorry ‚Äì we‚Äôre managing. This past week, after three months of living together, supporting each other, and getting to know each other, I asked Stella to be my partner. I see my son -supervised - twice a week for two hours at a time. I am less stressed and losing weight. Most of my belongings were saved by my father-in-law, who was gracious enough to hire a storage locker for the short term.

This post has been to let my side be seen, so that my lived experiences are known, to let you, my friends and family know why, and how, from my point of view. I have been deeply saddened to find that very few of you, my friends, of those that knew about this have contacted me to see my side, some of you passing judgement without any care or consideration. Those that have asked, I can count you all on ONE hand.

It all seems so stupid, for a marriage to fall apart, and for a family to be torn asunder over this, I had genuinely asked for this one thing, that I had mentioned many times before that I wanted to explore, that I felt was ‚Äì is a genuine part of me. The one time I asked for something that I genuinely wanted and needed - to be able to explore polyamory. I know it is not for most people; I understand that, but at the same time, it has been a part of me for as long as I can remember, even though I did not know what it was called. Why should I hide that I am indeed polyamorous? That I can, have and do genuinely love many people without any favouritism. Should I have ignored it? Should I have insisted on exploring it earlier in my relationship with Sara? Hindsight is 20/20, but there are far too many variables to answer those questions with any form of certainty.

I am fully aware that I have fault and blame to bear, I have never said or suggested otherwise.

To all my friends and family. I know that this will have come across as a massive shock. I am sorry.  I love you all, no matter what you decide from here. 

If you‚Äôd like to stay in contact, I‚Äôd very much appreciate a message with your number, just in case messenger doesn‚Äôt stay active.

I (59m) opened the door this evening to my Daughter-In-Law in shambles and tears. The story she told me was absolutely horrid. It made me want to disown my son.

He was at a New Year's Eve lunch, and came back. While my daughter-in-law was having coffee, he just told her that the change of times had made him frisky, and that he wanted to take it to the bedroom. She said she wasn't in the mood, and wanted to reflect on the year that had passed. He got annoyed and went to the bedroom, she followed him. While he was changing, he took his underpants off and asked her again, she just joked and said ""Looks good, but not right now"", at that point, he held her and soon she lost control of the situation.

This is the part where it got absolutely horrific. As he unclothed her and went in, she was naturally dry. Forcing himself in and going in and out over and over, the friction hurt him, and in anger he slapped her. Then it happened. Aggressively thrusting in her and pulling out, his foreskin was pulled in an excrutiatingly painful way. He screamed apparently, and my daughter-in-law just watched in disgust. She ran out of the house and came straight for my place (her own parents live far away).

I was disgusted with everything my 'son' had done. I feel horrible for raising such a person. I don't know what went wrong, or if there was something I could have done to prevent him from becoming like this or any other incidents before this when I could have intervened and beat his ass.

Sometime later, he called me, saying that he ""accidentally got hurt"" and needed my help. I just told him, ""Call a doctor, not me."" Then I promptly hung up the phone.

Game Potentially Revealed From Popular Studio,"***Another game has seemingly been revealed by the Gothic Therapy YouTube channel to be a recent client project of Sweet Baby Inc., the controversial narrative design firm co-founded by Kim Belair.***¬†

***The game in question is called The Crush House, and it was developed by Nerial LTD, which is most known for the strategy game¬†Reigns.¬†It was published by Devolver Digital, the company that put out¬†Cult of The Lamb.***¬†

[***https://youtu.be/Fqy375Okoes***](https://youtu.be/Fqy375Okoes)

***SBI‚Äôs alleged involvement was pointed out by the Gothic Therapy YouTube channel‚Äôs hosts MasterOfTheTDS and WritingRaven (For the sake of transparency: WritingRaven is a frequent contributor to That Park Place under the name Raven Redgrave).***

***The hosts identified it as a potential Sweet Baby Inc. game when one of Belair‚Äôs narrative designers admitted to working on the title on social media.***¬†

***Another former Sweet Baby Inc. employee also noted involvement with¬†The Crush House.***¬†

***Why is this important?***¬†

***Sweet Baby Inc. is a narrative design firm that injects DEI elements into games. Belair and many others have denied that this is the company‚Äôs primary goal, however past statements contradict this.***¬†

***‚ÄúWe do narrative development in games and kind of beyond and we try to bring inclusion, diversity, and new ideas kind of to the industry,‚Äù Belair said in a presentation at the Game Developers Conference in 2019.***

***She also stated the company does sensitivity reading, noting, ‚ÄúWe need sensitivity readers. We need risk assessment. And these are like, again, important services that I literally like list on every PDF that I send out to be like, ‚ÄòHey, I can do risk assessment and sensitivity reading.‚Äô‚Äù***

***Later on in her presentation, Belair admitted that she attempted to get a developer to race swap a character from a white Frenchman to a ‚Äúperson of color.‚Äù***

***Sweet Baby Inc. first became infamous after the disastrous rollout of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League¬†in early 2024. The game was a horrific failure loaded with forced diversity that reportedly cost WB Games an estimated $200 million in losses***

***After that, interviews with Belair started to surface, where she encouraged game devs to go to their marketing teams and ‚Äúterrify them.‚Äù***

***‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a creative working in AAA, which I did for many, many years, um put this stuff up to your higher-ups,‚Äù Belair said. ‚ÄúAnd if they don‚Äôt see the value in what you‚Äôre asking for when you ask for consultants, when you ask for research, go have a coffee with your marketing team and just terrify them with the possibility of what‚Äôs going to happen if they don‚Äôt give you what you want.‚Äù***¬†

[***https://youtu.be/Iq86DnmX2xY***](https://youtu.be/Iq86DnmX2xY)

***Gamers suddenly wanted to know which games and studios worked with the controversial company. A Steam user called Kabrutus Rambo created a Steam curator group called ‚ÄúSweet Baby Inc. Detected,‚Äù to inform gamers on which titles Belair had her hands in so that they could make educated purchasing decisions.***¬†

***Sweet Baby Inc. employees like Chris Kindred (who is no longer with the company) then attacked Kabrutus and attempted to get his entire Steam account taken down in response.***¬†

***Since then, SBI has seemed very hush hush about which games they‚Äôre actively working on. The company‚Äôs website highlights past titles like Spider-Man 2, Alan Wake 2,¬†and¬†God of War: Ragnarok. However, there‚Äôs not a lot about upcoming projects outside of¬†After Love EP by Pikselnesia and Pocket Sized Hands.***¬†

***MasterOfTheTDS alleged in a previous video, citing an inside source, that SBI has as many as thirty upcoming titles in active development.***¬†

***Many see the involvement of Belair and her team as an instant death sentence for a title in the modern gaming market.***

***Recent SBI commercial flops like Surgent Studios‚Äô Tales of Kenzera: ZAU¬†and Reflector Entertainment and Bandai Namco‚Äôs¬†Unknown 9: Awakening¬†make a powerful case for why so many studios try to keep their connection to Sweet Baby Inc. quiet.***¬†

***The Crush House is a reality TV production simulator where the player takes on the role of a producer and camera operator trying to cast and subsequently film a group of scantily clad people in an attempt to capture ‚Äúdrama and romance.‚Äù***

***The player is encouraged in the game‚Äôs trailer to keep the ratings up through their footage.***

It might seem like such an innocent and curious question from others, but it's freaking exhausting to answer that question all the time.

Before I married, I also saw it as a red flag when that was the first question someone asked me. My answer was usually met by a comment sexualizing my background. Since I'm no longer looking for a mate, I've learned to completely ignore the question and move onto other topics, or excuse myself from the superficial conversation. 

I find strangers in my current large US metro area don't ask that question, for which I'm thankful. But hearing that question again a few days ago made me think about past interactions.

Some of the ways in which I force my employer to pay me the market rate are:

In terms of time: 
-Routinely show up 20-30min late
-Always take an extra 15 minutes for lunch
-Plenty of breaks during the day
-Around 15 fake sick days in 2024
-Leave 10-15 minutes early

In terms of stuff:
-Company laptops and phones
-An Apple Watch
-Cutlery from the restaurant
-Little Butter packs, sugar, and coffee pods (ground coffee)
-We get free lunch (I‚Äôve factored the value of this in) and I take lunch plus food for home
-Toilet paper
-Started trying to take soap in a ziploc but it was too impractical

About a year ago, my manager started complaining about my punctuality, and I told her ‚Äúlook, someone who lives under the extreme privilege of being able to work from home more than 0% of the time shouldn‚Äôt be complaining about people who are forced to be in the office a minimum of 45 hours a week. We are the reason you don‚Äôt need to do it. And also, aren‚Äôt you supposed to be here more often as per your contract? I‚Äôve only seen you here once this month.‚Äù

She denied needing to be in more often (a lie, as know the guy in charge of the contract from the client‚Äôs side), yet she backed off completely. My year-end performance review was great :D

- Graduated from a reputable uni; have a corporate job
- I'm more of an introvert but has a fun side also

- At least 5'9 and on the slim/slim fit side also
- I'm usually smitten by smart/nerdy looking men hehe but it's really the wit and substance that keeps me interested

I recently started experimenting with a SAD lamp to address my morning drowsiness and improve my mood. After using it daily for two weeks, I‚Äôve noticed that my drowsiness improved, I feel slightly more productive in the mornings, and, surprisingly, I‚Äôve stopped craving coffee.

While I‚Äôve never been a coffee addict‚ÄîI mainly drink it for the taste‚Äîthere were always days I‚Äôd skip it. Now, with the SAD lamp, those coffee-free days are becoming far more frequent.

To compare, I also have an infrared lamp, but I use it only when I have a clogged nose, I don‚Äôt feel the effect of it otherwise. Hence, the effect of the SAD lamp for me is much more pronounced.

How I use it:

	‚Ä¢	I invested in a more powerful SAD lamp.

	‚Ä¢	I turn it on during breakfast and place it at a 45-degree angle to my face (about 20cm away).

	‚Ä¢	I never look directly at the light, but I make sure to use it every morning.

Recommended brand:

I recommend Beurer‚Äôs SAD lamp, the one which is a bit more expensive so you can place at a 20cm distance.

My research:

	‚Ä¢	The SAD lamp should be great for jet lags

	‚Ä¢	It should be great for a biological clock shift if you‚Äôre a night owl

I am (23), my partner is (29), my mother (50) and father (60). For this Christmas and New Years my partner and I went to my parents house to celebrate. My parents live in remote area which pretty much means there isn't anything other then nature and wildlife there. The reason why we went there was for the animals my parents have. 

My father and I don't see eye to eye in most things. He is very conservative, openly racist (saying in public ""arabs are all rapist!"", ""Romanians are just dirty thiefs!""  and "" Immigrants are coming to this country to steal good people's jobs!"") and very old fashioned. I am other hand total opposite to him and hate to hear his racist remarks and old fashioned views, that he most time tries to push on me. And if you don't believe that then here is little info about things he has done to me to become perfect daughter:  
\-Tried to make me have a baby at 18 years old.   
\-Told me I have to care of him when he gets old.  
\-The career that I chose should cater to him so I can serve him on that part.

So to the part where I may be the asshole... My father tries to tell me do things. Mostly for himself. But the way he does it is not asking, it is ordering like a dog. When my partner first heard it he was horrified why my father tries to command me like a dog.  
"" Get the newspaper!""  
"" Clean this. ""  
""Pick up this!""  
""Give it to me.""  
"" Make coffee.""  
And my solution for it has been ignoring him or saying "" Do it yourself. "" or "" I can't do it, or want to do it. "" He has gotten very angry to me because of it. He looks pissed off all the time and takes deep breaths when I say no to him. One point when he ordered me again and I said no. He started ranting how negative I have become. That I always deny him and don't do things for him. I just said that I am not negative and I still feel like he is angry and frustrated that he can't command me like when I was under 18.

You were , without a doubt , everything to me

I thought of you when that band played a song you had wanted to hear for so long tonight 

Morning coffee makes me think of you , we shared so many . 

On my drives, I often look for you. 

Your dark blue eyes and cheeky dimples will never leave my head . 

i adored you. 

Your creativity , your imagination, your ability to cling to the road when obstacles come your way. 

You gave me adventures 

You showed me places, people, pockets of things I would have never thought of 

You tore me apart .

Under all of the kisses , flowers, and fun nights with stomach burning laughs 

There was always something missing in you 

As you got used to me , the excitement dispersed 

You grew restless to fill voids 

I couldn‚Äôt do that any longer for you

The new grew old 

But i still loved you , as the day I first laid eyes on you . 

I wish you could grow up faster 

I wish our priorities were the same

Lucien Graft floated aimlessly through an empty void. Memories danced at the edges of his consciousness, hazy and surreal.

Where am I? How did I get here? Is this a dream?

His life flashed before him‚Äînot as a montage of triumphs, but a dreary sequence of long office hours, cold takeout dinners, and the faint hum of fluorescent lights. No friends to call his own, no family beyond his mother, whose memories had long been claimed by her illness. His existence had been an endless loop of monotony.

That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ God, my life sucks. Maybe this is some kind of stress dream?

The thought brought the last memory into focus. He was at his desk, staring blankly at the clock, counting down the hours until another wasted day was over. A yawn, a stretch, a knock of his elbow‚Äîthen the lukewarm coffee spilled across his desk, dripping into the exposed power strip below. A spark. A flash. Pain so fleeting he barely registered it.

Wait‚Ä¶ am I dead? From a crappy cup of office coffee? Really?!

A voice answered, interrupting his spiraling thoughts.

‚ÄúYep. Dead as a doornail. Sorry about that.‚Äù

Lucien spun, or at least he felt like he did‚Äîthere was no ground, no body. Before him materialized a man seated on a grand marble throne. His attire was‚Ä¶ odd. A blend of gaudy and regal, like a businessman who‚Äôd won the lottery and couldn‚Äôt decide between power or flair. The throne was surrounded by an endless expanse of clouds and a fading sunset that didn‚Äôt seem to belong to any particular horizon.

‚ÄúWho‚Äîwhat‚Äîare you?‚Äù Lucien stammered.

The man smirked, leaning forward. ‚ÄúI am Lulutera. A god, as you mortals call us. And‚Ä¶ well, I hate to admit it, but your untimely death was my bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour bad?! I died because of you?!‚Äù

Lulutera raised a hand to cut him off. ‚ÄúLook, I said I was sorry. It was an accident‚Äîhonestly, I thought the fire suppression in that office was better. Humans and their safety codes‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, shaking his head. ‚ÄúAnyway! I‚Äôm here to make it up to you.‚Äù

Lucien folded his arms, skeptical. ‚ÄúAnd how exactly do you plan to fix this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt send you back‚Äîyour body‚Äôs‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs not dwell on that. But I can offer you a new life. A better one, in a new world! Think of it as‚Ä¶ reincarnation, with perks.‚Äù

Lucien stared, his disbelief mounting. ‚ÄúI had a life, you know. A crappy one, sure, but it was mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you, though? No friends, no real family to miss you‚Äîand you hated your job. I‚Äôm doing you a favor here. So what‚Äôll it be? Rebirth, or the afterlife? I warn you, limbo‚Äôs a bit crowded these days.‚Äù

Damn, he‚Äôs not wrong. Lucien exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll bite. What‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo catch!‚Äù Lulutera snapped his fingers, and a massive spinning wheel appeared, filled with thousands of cryptic symbols and images. ‚ÄúJust spin the Wheel of Reincarnation to find your new form. I‚Äôll even throw in a blessing. Go on, give it a whirl.‚Äù

Lucien looked from the wheel to Lulutera and back again, his annoyance bubbling. ‚ÄúThis is a joke, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I look like I joke?‚Äù Lulutera replied, deadpan, though the faint smirk undermined his words.

Reluctantly, Lucien stepped forward and spun the wheel. It turned for what felt like an eternity, Lulutera humming a jaunty tune as it clicked past options like ‚ÄúMoss Sprite,‚Äù ‚ÄúStone Golem,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRoyal Griffin.‚Äù Finally, the wheel slowed, its pointer settling on an image of a dark, flaming bird.

‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù Lulutera exclaimed, clapping his hands. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve hit the jackpot! The legendary Ebonflame Phoenix. Not only are you the first of your kind, but you‚Äôre also bound to shake things up in your new world. They‚Äôll never see you coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúA phoenix? Seriously?‚Äù Lucien grimaced. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you make me human or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoring! Besides, this body has so much potential. Trust me, you‚Äôll thank me later.‚Äù Lulutera snapped his fingers again. The ground beneath Lucien vanished, sending him plummeting toward an endless sky.

‚ÄúWait! What about my blessing‚Äî?!‚Äù His scream was cut off as black flames engulfed him, reshaping his body into a fiery egg, solidified in a cocoon of smoldering ash.

The New World

The village of Ardentwood had known peace for generations, nestled in the shadow of the Emberstone Mountains. But in recent months, the winds carried whispers of unease. Monsters grew bold, attacking in waves that even seasoned adventurers struggled to repel. The skies seemed darker, the forests quieter‚Äîa foreboding stillness that set even the most stoic farmers on edge.

It was on one such uneasy evening that a fiery streak tore across the heavens, crashing into a field just outside the village. Farmers gathered warily, weapons in hand, only to find a smoldering crater‚Äîand within it, a blackened, glowing egg, pulsing with an ominous warmth.

Word spread quickly. Some whispered it was a blessing, others a curse. But one thing was certain: the world would never be the same.

(I've decided to try a new idea that I've been kicking around for a bit. Obviously, it's an isekai. I've never done one before, and certainly never played as a creature before so I'm definitely excited to see how this plays out. I will say that there will be mechanics in place later on in the story to allow my character to take on a humanoid form, and I plan on having that implemented fairly quickly but there's going to be a period where our characters won't be able to talk to escorts beyond body language. So that should be fun. 

This should start off fairly light-hearted as you'll be able to see, but there is some serious notes that will manager later on as the story progresses. This is gonna be 1x1 but I would like to take this off Reddit in favor of a somewhat more organized platform which we can discuss later. Finally, I do have some minor questions and requests which we can discuss later. I doubt any of them will be any issue for anyone)

Volume eating healthier options. Only bringing single serving package of trigger foods into my home. 

Meal planning only 2-3 days in advance and following the grocery list. Not getting anything additional. Add the snacks to your list if you know you‚Äôll get then either way, get used to getting only what is on the list. 

Don‚Äôt keep a binge-able amount of food available but don‚Äôt deny yourself some flexibility and options.

Eating dessert really triggers me into a salty & sweet binge cycle so I cut out dessert and had any sweets for the day in the afternoon and still stick to that for the most part.

I allow flexibility during my cycle and up my iron intake a few days before and during, it helps a lot. 

Black coffee - I used to love it but recently started getting sweet creamy coffees again‚Ä¶ it took a bit of getting used to again but I‚Äôm back on black coffee and I don‚Äôt have nearly as harsh of on afternoon crash as before. This helps prevent binges as tiredness maybe doesn‚Äôt trigger it but makes it harder to resist. 

Yoga, nightly. Big fan of yoga for bloating but any light exercise works. Find something you don‚Äôt mind and do it while watching a show, doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect but it helps almost every aspect of my life.

1hqz5lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1hqz5lf/thoughts_on_my_layover_in_abu_dhabi/,Thoughts on my layover in Abu Dhabi,"I visited the UAE for the first time with a layover (overnight) at Abu Dhabi. Thoughts:

While I loved Abu Dhabi airport (which was very modern and I realize the new terminal opened recently), it doesn't offer basic services which I would expect from an airport. First - visitor SIMs are not provided and is not consistent like how it is in Dubai (which provides a free du 1 GB SIM). Etisalat seems to provide a visitor SIM for 24 hours for free - although the counter refused to give them to me, saying that it has to be obtained online (my guess is that the physical counter just want to make money - and contradicted Etisalat's support system which by the way is also trash). When I tried to verify my identity on the Etisalat website, they seem to use some trash AI software which would not recognize my face even after dozens of attempts. I gave up at some point since I didn't want to pay for roaming (I was only going to be in the city for a few hours). As someone living in Qatar, while the telcos are not really that much better, Ooredoo/Vodafone QA at least does not openly advertise a free visitor SIM and fail to supply them, and they also offer fairly cheaper and fairer rates as compared to the UAE telcos especially for visitors.

When I needed to call someone urgently at the airport - there were no public telephones at all even after asking around. This was weird as Doha airport in Qatar has telephones in the arrivals area. WhatsApp calls are also blocked at the airport (which I understand is common in the UAE and in Qatar - but they should really consider allowing them at the airport as basic courtesy to visiting tourists at least).  The arrivals area at Abu Dhabi airport is also really under-equipped, and the only facilities that seemed to be around were ATMs, currency exchanges, as well as telco outlets and a single Costa Coffee outlet. More shops and facilities could be placed to encourage visitors interested in exploring the city.

I wanted to visit the Abu Dhabi Zayed grand mosque at night - while it is normally closed they seemed to offer a night tour which has to be prebooked for AED 20, which I did online. When I tried to get a taxi to get into the city - none of the drivers at the airport agreed to take me to the mosque since they assumed it was closed. Some of the drivers also do not seem to understand what I tried to say in English properly and were not aware of average taxi fares when I made enquiries. In Qatar at least there is a properly managed Karwa taxi service from the airport which allows you to travel anywhere in the city, and you can pay using a credit/debit card using the readers they have - which Abu Dhabi taxis do not seem to fully have. I did end up abandoning the mosque tour plan and decided to take the Abu Dhabi public bus to get into town. Also for some reason the mosque never charged me for the tour - I'm not even sure if they still offer such night tours as of now or not.

Now the public bus system connecting Abu Dhabi is surprisingly very efficient - and I was able to get where I wanted to (the Corniche) even though it was the middle of the night. When I arrived at the Corniche I noticed that there were public art exhibitions placed there, and it just seems as if they could better promote tourism from the airport itself, with flyers or advertisements promoting such attractions with public transit instead of over-reliance on taxis (I saw SO MANY of them even in the middle of the night which surprised me). I feel that the bus system is something that could be used to better improve connectivity and tourism in the city, and while I understand that tourism in Abu Dhabi is a work in progress, it seems they definitely have the money to improve and better promote things. I also appreciate the road and infrastructure which was of good quality and is comparable to Doha.

All in all, I would visit Abu Dhabi again (preferably during the day - I'd love to see the Louvre and the mosque properly), and take the public transit again, but I would do it with a longer layover or visit and with more time and planning. I'd also opt for roaming or an e-sim from an online provider or outright pay the pricey rates that they offer if I truly need it.

I‚Äôm really wondering if I should buy the DeLonghi Eletta Explore. Currently, I own the Philips 5400, and I‚Äôm quite disappointed with the machine because the espresso always turns out really watery (I‚Äôve tried grind settings 1 and 3). I have it from 2 years. 

I primarily drink espresso-based beverages, so I‚Äôm curious: are the espresso shots from the Eletta rich and topped with a good amount of crema? That‚Äôs how I enjoy my coffee.

I‚Äôm also debating whether I should just buy a standard Delonghi espresso machine or go for something like the Barista Express Impress. I‚Äôm hesitant because I‚Äôd prefer not to purchase a separate grinder‚Äîespecially since the good ones seem quite expensive.

Everything works, pressure is good, nice coffee, good milk etc... but clearly a problem that needs resolving.

* **The Coffee Table** \- The most uncomfortable movie I've ever seen. (watch this at your own discretion)

* **Hounds of Love** \- The second most uncomfortable movie I've seen. (has themes of sexual assault)

* ***Historia de lo Oculto*** **/ History of the Occult** \- Full of soul, very imaginative and magnificently directed.

* **Milk and Serial** \- The best psych horror found footage movie I have seen. Free on YouTube and with a budget of *800* dollars, it absolutely oozes creativity. Can't wait to see more from these guys

* **The Loved Ones** \- Superbly done slasher. So intense, amazingly directed and has moments where you can barely manage to look at the screen.

* **The Devil's Candy** \- Refreshing take on the supernatural genre, amazing suspense build up that has you on the edge of your seat.

* **When Evil Lurks** \- Gets your heart going, amazing concept.

* **The Substance** \- The best body horror movie I've seen.

* **Resolution and The Endless** \- Very interesting concept and I loved the direction.

* **VVitch** \- Absolutely amazing ambience, superb acting.

* **The First Omen** \- So well done. Stunning and with a twist you might be dreading but won't expect.

* **Hereditary** \- Has some of the best cinematography I've seen, A24 killed it.

* **The Wailing** \- Original and with twists you don't see coming.
* **Incantation** ‚Äì Uncomfortable to watch, keeps you on the edge of your seat and has one of the few jump scares that truly got me.

* **Pearl Series (Pearl, X, MaXXXine)** \- well done slasher series with an amazing performance by Mia Goth.

* **Get Out** \- Very well done, great thriller.

* **The Babadook** \- One of the most unsettling I've seen in paranormal horror.

* **Midsommar** \- Brutal and graphic, chock full of emotion - themes of suicide.

* **Spring** \- More romance than horror but great nonetheless.

* **Split and Glass** \- Interesting concept amplified by stellar performances by James McAvoy.

* **MadS** \- Keeps you hooked, it being shot in one continuous take really elevates the suspense and urgency.

* **The Medium** \- Well done possession horror.

* **Veronica** \- Great paranormal flick.

* **The Boy** \- Good suspense build up, original concept.

* **Late Night with the Devil** \- Great aesthetic but I found the ending to be underwhelming.",4,1735719468.0,horror,1,0.75,False
